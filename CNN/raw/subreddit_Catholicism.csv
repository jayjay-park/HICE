5337,0,t1_ceetjld,Take this lightly because Im not referencing anything but my memory of stuff I read in the past years butOne diocese rebelled against their bishop amp basically forced Rome to send them a more liberal bishop. A union of priests have threatened strike. There is a huge move to ordain women amp married men and have Vatican approval for communion for those who are in an invalid second marriage it is already happening they just want approval. These priests arent going to get what they want and all they need is a bad bishop to lead them over the edge. There have been murmurings of schism the past few years. A lot of it was tied to the rehabilitation of the SSPX if they got a personal prelature schism of the liberals was almost sure to happen and talk has died down a bit since the election of Francis  but I believe he will ultimately disappoint them and realizing that they are never going to get a Pope more liberal than Francis will despair that their reforms will die with them quickly approaching in some places and will finally make overt acts of schism.,Catholicism,cef1m2j,1,t5_2qi4f

First for the government to police an area such as medical care leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Secondly re the effectiveness of the therapy...why focus specifically on this practice when other therapies that may be equally dubious get a pass? In truth psychology and psychiatry as currently practiced are utter garbage. There are a few genuine mental disorders in the world...unipolar depression anxiety schizophrenia psychopathy....but the DSM runs to almost a thousand pages...dformation professionnelle and medical imperialism plain and simple. My two cents on the issue as a man who has no attraction to women but tries to live according to Catholic teachings is that such reorientation efforts do not so much as change you from homosexual to heterosexual as they give you breathing room to realize that marriage is a compromise. For those who truly want children and a family this realization is all that is needed. I do not believe you need to be physically attracted to or passionately love your partner for a successful marriage. This is all woolheaded nonsense. Looks beauty fade sic transit gloria mundi and all that  by age  or so even the best among us are shopworn and faded.

141213,0,t1_cetxiub,I like your politeness and your fear of karmaloss.  Have an upvote on me.As I said I am not a theologian and Fr. Ripperger... well is.  And a good one at that.  However I think he is misinterpreting Aquinas here.  The passage he is referencing at  is Summa Theologiae IIII Q A Reply Objection gtGravity of a sin depends more on the abuse of a thing than on the omission of the right use. Wherefore among sins against nature the lowest place belongs to the sin of uncleanness which consists in the mere omission of copulation with another. While the most grievous is the sin of bestiality because use of the due species is not observed. Hence a gloss on Genesis  He accused his brethren of a most wicked crime says that they copulated with cattle. After this comes the sin of sodomy because use of the right sex is not observed. Lastly comes the sin of not observing the right manner of copulation which is more grievous if the abuse regards the vas than if it affects the manner of copulation in respect of other circumstances.It appears to me that Aquinas is here simply stating that oral and anal sex are immoral if they are constitute the form of the marital act takes  that is if oral andor anal are carried out to completion without depositing husbands semen in wifes vagina.  He is making the further point that on the grand scale of mortal sins using oral sex or deliberate withdrawal abuse of the vas is more evil than using a condom or spermicide abuse in respect of other circumstances .  Fr. Rippergers far more restrictive reading seems unsupported both by the words themselves and by the surrounding context  he weaves this principle of the vas out of a single sentence that only tangentially mentions the vas at all.  It seems to me that the rest of Aquinass naturallaw argument for married sexual intercourse fatally undermines Fr. Rippergers narrow interpretation  and I dont see support for that interpretation elsewhere in Magisterial documents either.  Thus I reject it and must stand by my original post.Ive never read St. Alphonsus though so I have no idea what he says.,Catholicism,ceuiiti,1,t5_2qi4f

212876,0,t3_1whtpt,Im afraid that nothing about these pictures attracts me. To my mind they show an inordinate attachment to a baroque aesthetic with its visual clutter and its exaggerated theatricality which leaves me cold. The political needs of the Church in the th century might provide a partexcuse for the emergence of these forms but I fail to see how they can correspond meaningfully with the aesthetic sensibilities of our day. Apart of course from their contribution to a welcome aesthetic pluralism these forms will commend themselves to some Catholics and Im glad they have the chance to organise their worship around them. Theyre not for me though. I think its a failed aesthetic and that it will only ever have an archival or museum feel to it. If I had to choose my cultic forms from a past age I would be much more drawn to the relative simplicity and solidity of the Romanesque. And if I required more ornament I would choose the Byzantine long before the Baroque. Im happiest of all however with a pareddown cleanlined contemporary aesthetic.As I said Im all for giving people choices. What I dont find acceptable though is the tendency to transcendentalise the Baroque to make out that it can be disembedded from history and culture and represented as a timeless and perfect form of expressing cult and devotion. This is not so. Sadly antihistorical tendencies like this seem to afflict many people who identify themselves as Catholic traditionalists.,Catholicism,cf2owfj,1,t5_2qi4f

216614,0,t3_1wiwfs,I was raised to see Catholics as nearheretical beings just barely on the fringes of what was Christian by my father. Around the time I got to college and good for me went  miles from home for it I met some Catholics during my time there. What I found was that there are two kinds of Catholic. There are the kind who go to Mass every Sunday look and act right and are spiritually hollow you know the kind of person Im talking about from your protestant churches no doubt.The other kind and the vast majority of them that I met actually knew more about what their bibles were really telling them than any protestant from a preacher on down that I had ever met. They didnt just know what the Bible said they knew why it said it and what it meant in context my churches had never mentioned that context mattered.Within the past yeartodate I went to my first mass with my thengirlfriend she is Catholic. I learned more in the  minutes of homily than I would have in a month of protestant services. In total I attended  masses  were good. One was about Bruno Mars  Grenade. Yea. The priest was out of ideas that day. No mad just kinda funny in a way.Anywho why should you become a Catholic? Because the religious practices and procedures might help you in your walk. For example communion as you know it they call it sacraments is held every single Sunday. The service follows a specific timetable readings from the Old Testament New Testament and Catechism? a rosary to hold in your hand as you recite prayers if you are the sort of person who needs to memorize them to find your religious center. Having to judge every Mass whether you are worthy of taking the sacraments or only of receiving a blessing from the priest. Etc. If these sorts of traditions help you in your walk with our Lord then becoming a Catholic will benefit you.If the traditions do not help you or worse cause you to focus on the tradition as the act of worship rather than a method to focus your mind and spirit then you should not become a Catholic. I will let the Catholics comment as to whether you would still be welcome for the information disseminated at a Mass for I am not one myself and can speak with no authority. If the concept that religious traditions exist to help build or maintain a style of thinking and are solely for the people who need them and not part of the religious faith itself some are like baptism. But others such as the rosary are purely for the benefit of the human. is a totally new concept for you think about it for a long time before making a choice learn to see the difference between dogma is there a better word for this? and actual faithspirituality. Once you can clearly see the difference you will know which road you need to walk.As for me and why I am not a Catholic myself I cannot find it in myself to believe that the sacraments literally become the flesh and blood of Christ this is what my catholic exgirlfriend told me so if this is not an actual church belief do tell...and explain the new meaning of the bell that sounds when the event happens.

We know the root cause. The practice is new and it exists because of babies who were found in dumpsters abandoned by mothers who wanted to get rid of their newborns.

293956,0,t3_1xg8m4,I very much see the wisdom in the analogy of religious beliefs and significant others but I dont think it really addresses what atheists are after when they ask how we know Catholicism is the one true religion.  Its ignoring the fact that Catholicism claims to be the single true way to eternal life and that people of other beliefs or none at all put their souls in grave danger. The risk of choosing a suboptimal set of beliefs is much greater so we claim than marrying a certain woman instead of the slightly hotter version of herself that lives three states away. When our oddball friend finds a weird lady who loves him for his weirdness we are happy we dont try to convince him to find a wife exactly like our own. Yet when the same friend joins a voodoo cult we are rightly concerned for his soul no matter how happy he says it makes him.Which leaves us with the valid question how can we be sure that Catholicism is the right belief? For me Im not sure I can ever be  factually sure  there are just too many other belief systems to truly consider. So yes I agree with Mr. Barnes when he compares finding a religion to finding a spouse.

Okay they dont believe in God or any divine nature. Thats all fine and dandy but it has no bearing on the debate. The debate should never be about science vs. faith because they can exist in harmony. The question that I would love to ask is why do they dismiss philosophy outright? Why is why not a valid question? They like to equate us with every other form of life on the planet as a collection of cells and electric stimuli but they ignore the one thing that makes us different. They ignore the fact that we are able to reason and ask how and why. There is something different and higher about us and that is something that science cant really touch.

412560,0,t1_cfni499,I agree that of course Papal Authority is always going to be a thorn for the Protestant and the playing field so to speak in the Orthodox Church may seem more even to them as a convert. However as far as liturgy is concerned I think we as Catholics are more familiar with the Eastern Rites and the existence of other liturgies available that are just not known to many outside the Church especially Protestants who are mostly from a Western Christian perspective. Regardless of what else is offered it is still a fact that the vast majority of Masses offered in the Catholic Church are in the Ordinary Form. One must hunt to find alternatives to the latin Ordinary Form and in many places in the world one does not exist and therefor I do not think they can be considered a viable argument especially when relating to those outside the Church in search of ancient liturgy. I would even go as far as to say that we would be considered welleducated Catholics and than many people within our own Church are unaware of Eastern Rites and some unaware of new comers such as the Anglican Ordinariate and the use of the Anglican rite. This has been a topic of discussion recently in the post Breathing Deeply With One Lung A mustread for every RomanLatin Catholic! where the author reflects on latin Catholics admonishing fellow Catholics as being unCatholic for their liturgical form. In my last point as well I was also touched subtly on the part of how this also reflects on this situation EastWest relations.

510220,0,t1_cfxjace,Separate from the Catholic vs Protestant debate theres an active campaign to ridicule and debunk ALL Christianity worldwide. Some of it is internal to Christians like Joseph Smith wanting power and money above the legal laws thus forming a new revelation. Some of it is governments wanting to take money political power healthcare and education away from the churches. Some are corporate interests that benefit from consumerism a lack of empathy for ALL humans and Gods planet and unhealthy behaviors. We should unite in our common beliefs and actions not debate the differences. I fully intend to not only remain faithful in the eyes of the Catholic Church but seek Christ in other denominations as well. My former Southern Baptist pastor had AMAZING sermons on abstinence and chaste behaviors. Some of the Evangelical books on the subject break it down to the most easily digestible vocabulary. Yes the Catechism and Compendium are great for the logistics. But I always remember the slogan lust is a brain out of bounds!,Catholicism,cfy9jiz,1,t5_2qi4f

514779,0,t1_cfyhgv7,Yes the added material is the Haydock commentary orthodox and imprimatured which means it has been approved by a bishop which also means what is written is authorized and backed by the Church. The Haydock commentary is solid and has been trusted since .Our bishops are the successors of the Apostles by lineage and if only all of them in their office lived up to the Apostles example. You know what I mean  not all of them are as holy and great as the Apostles but their mission is the same as the Apostles mission. A huge responsibility. This is why an imprimatur carries so much weight. You may know all of this about our bishops already but Im saying so just in case.As Catholics we follow the Churchs interpretation of scripture as that is safe. Our own interpretation cannot be trusted because through error of facts or our tendency to sin we may get ourselves into huge trouble. Satan can quote and twist scripture to his own sick ends and so can we. Even a wellmeaning person can step into error.We should study scripture and test any and all of our own ideas against the Church which is the source of scripture. We can go wrong on our own following our own way and trusting in ourselves. We cannot go wrong accepting and submitting to what the Church teaches about the meaning of scripture especially if we stick with writings authorized by the Church which have stood the test of time. And especially if those authorized writings come from a time when error heresy and heterodoxy was not tolerated. Such things are the greatest wealth in the world. Billionaires are in poverty all their wealth meaningless compared to the guidance which can fortify sinners as they strive to be saints.That someones opinion being found by a bishop to be free of error and therefore teaching what the Church teaches is an opinion worth trusting. It is commentary on the Douay Rheims bible first published in  and again imprimatured and timetested and translated directly from the Latin Vulgate.Both the bibles you mentioned are Protestant translations. As a Catholic you should not seek guidance from their interpretations and you should not expose yourself to error by reading their translations without skepticism. Even the King James version has error.Look at the fruits of Protestant sects in the world and think of how well they have done in the centuries since the Reformation. Thousands of confused sects splintered and in disagreement with no real unity or common understanding often doubting or abandoning the value of reason increasing tolerance of sin among their ranks half the sacraments abandoned if they even have any  some dont even baptize anyone to any effect all of this sends souls to hell and in our day they are a large enough source of atheists.It would be uncharitable and fraternally negligent of me to not tell you this  seeking guidance from all the things you have mentioned is eventually going to put your soul in danger somehow probably in many ways you will not enjoy uncovering. Confusion is unhappy and trust me as someone who went through deep and bewildering confusion that I thank God for bringing me through. The kind of darkness you can and likely will encounter is not like shadow  it is sticky and suffocating and it may take you years or decades of your life to untangle and remove yourself from where you could go. It may be your end and the damnation of your soul. Certainly seeking guidance from buddhism and the Koran is not exposing you to enlightenment or holiness. It is exposing you to Satan. Satan hates you more than you have the ability to understand.Satan will use these things to lure you in ways you cannot imagine and if you do find your way out of it after the fact your knowledge of how he lures and deceives you will not be worth it. It is a dance you cannot do and you cannot trick the devil or go venturing where he rules without being wounded and scarred. People try that and guess how many end up in hell?The idea that there is secret knowledge waiting for us in unexpected or hidden places secret keys to unlock mysteries that will lead us to salvation is gnosticism a longcondemned heresy. Which means it is yet another domain and trap of Satan. You are taking huge chances with the only soul youve got and your guidance cannot match the guidance available and waiting for you. You could not match it with  lifetimes. Take a huge lifealtering warning from the end King Solomon met if you have to. He was the wisest man who ever lived and was granted understanding directly by God yet he still was lured into worshiping strange gods in the end. Who are you?The Church has everything you seek. Everything. The best goal of all though is to realize that people like you and me do not need or merit all the knowledge to which we may be drawn and that we should first and always seek to ensure our souls are saved by living in prayer and the Sacraments in sanctity cooperating with Gods grace to do His will so that we will be prepared to die a good death. What King David asked from God is what I think you seek. God asked David what he wanted and David said to do your will.If we would just seek to do Gods will we are blessed to have the way made clear for us by the Church. It is no mystery. It is the basics taught in the catechism. The challenges we meet will require us to seek even more help from God but even a child can be taught what is necessary for salvation.What else is there for you to seek? If you think there are lies hidden within orthodox Catholic teachings you need to spend all the time necessary talking to good priests to settle those suspicions. If you ignore all of this quite honestly I am terrified for what you face.You may be an old man near to death when you finally discover what is wrong. I have seen how that can happen and God saved me from it. You are on that path.,Catholicism,cfys7vy,1,t5_2qi4f

622764,0,t3_219g5z,In some of the older calendars all Feasts relating to Our Lord and Our Lady were considered Holy Days of Obligation. Generally most traditionalist communities still use older calendars. As part of their charism for older devotions they tend to also follow older Holy Days of Obligation rather than the newer requirements which are much less in number. In my parish we still hold on to an old calendar which means we celebrate Feasts and Holy Days of Obligation according to its standards. The most common are the Calendars of   and .With that said most traditionalist communities especially those in communion with Rome use the  calendar. The calendar and rubrics of  were not only the agreed upon usage by Archbishop Lefebvre but also what was prescribed by John Paul II and Benedict XVI in their respective motu proprios expanding the use of the pre form. This is especially the case for Benedict XVI as he specifically named the  rubrics as the hence forth called Extraordinary Form. In the  calendar the Annunciation is not a Holy Day of Obligation however it is a Holy Day and a Feast of the st Class and a very important Feast in the Roman calendar.The Annunciation holds much importance in the history of the Church and Her calendar. For a couple centuries the Annunciation or Lady Day in English speaking countries was considered the first day of the year as it was the beginning of Our Lord in the Incarnation. The Una Voce people are quite reliable and either may be using an older version of a liturgical calendar or it was a misprint. I would not think too much into it. ,Catholicism,cgb24m7,5,t5_2qi4f

671075,1,t1_cggj7qg,Yeah the RCC generally supports gun control. The NY Conference of Catholic Bishops generally supports the law as a whole but has concerns about that bills mental health checks as stated in this policy statementgtThe NY SAFE Act the gun control bill shepherded through the Legislature early in  by Governor Cuomo contained many important provisions designed to address the scourge of gun violence afflicting our state. The Conference supported this legislation as a whole. However organizations representing mental health and medical professionals have raised a legitimate concern regarding the reporting requirement by the new law mandates.  These professionals rightly have always been required to report individuals who they believe pose an imminent threat to themselves or others. However under the new law these professionals must report any individual who they believe is likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others. Providers fear that this lower standard will discourage individuals from getting the help they need out of fear of being reported. Without mental health services a mentally ill person with violent tendencies may not get the medication or therapy he or she needs that would prevent such incidents in the first place.gtWe therefore join with the mental health community in urging an amendment to the NY SAFE Act to return to the imminent danger language with a specific definition of what constitutes an imminent danger. This definition may include past patterns of behavior that point toward a real threat. We further urge that records of previous mental health hospitalization be expunged sooner than the five years in current law also with the goal of reducing barriers to persons seeking treatment.,Catholicism,cggju0y,1,t5_2qi4f

Among other reasons the multiplication of infant baptisms all through the year the increase of rural parishes and the growth of dioceses often prevented the bishop from being present at all baptismal celebrations.

746428,0,t3_22nbyg,I shared my thoughts there in short I greatly support the charismatic renewal but a number of factors have combined to stall it in the U.S.   peaking too soon  not preparing volunteer leadership as to why to remain Catholic at the expense of new dynamic worship.  covenant community became insular. And then it became divided.  a natural generation gap occurred when Baby Boomers initially the ringleaders of the Renewal dropped involvement so to raise their families not a lot of babysitting services available while Greatest Gen and Silent Gen cliques formed. Once Boomers returned it was hard to do so.  in covenant communities it was discovered that children raised there were not immune from hormones and gasp secular music. Many became resentful for the life they had and rejected the movement outright when they came of age.  in  the covenant community model was greatly ruptured due to poor leadership. One of the biggest casualties was the sizable loss of its original worship music which serves as a binder.

Note that the Church doesnt also say what the penalties should be for any other kind of murder.  She doesnt say what the penalties should be for rape or theft.  It sounds like you have some sort of convenient exception for the case of abortion where the Church needs to overextend her own authority.But the government still has a responsibility to protect human life.  As citizens in democratic societies we have the responsibility to influence our governments in this way.  The government cannot ever condone or allow innocent people to be slaughtered and to look the other way or worse to support it is a horrible action.   As far as I know there should be zero issue with just considering  the lives children in utero the same way we consider outside the womb but I say this as a citizen not as a member of the Church.

You just need to upgrade from nonpracticing to active.Call the church  either the parish closest to your house or the one your girlfriend goes to.  Make an appointment with the priest.Meanwhile start going to Mass every Sunday.  Dont receive Communion until after youve spoken to the priest.When you talk to the priest fill him in on your situation and ask for his guidance.  Did you receive First Holy Communion and First Confession in a Catholic Church?  How about Confirmation?  Let him know whether or not you received these Sacraments.  If youve already received First Holy Communion and First Confession then all you have to do is go to Confession and youll be ready to pick up active membership in the Church.If you havent received First Holy Communion and First Confession the priest will help you get ready to receive these Sacraments as well as the Sacrament of Confirmation.  You will want to be Confirmed before you get married.This is for further down the road see if your parents still have your certificate of baptism  you will need it for your marriage.

This is not the case. The app has a small set of features that focus on helping users prepare for and make a good integral confession  It has a mini profile for each user of the device that is password protected and keeps track of your state in life single married religious etc. and the date of your last confession using the app. It walks the user through an editable examination of conscience with counters rather than simple checkmarks. It walks the user through the process of confession step by step including the users list of sins and an act of contrition which can be selected from several versions. It includes a small selection of common prayers like the Our Father Hail Mary Glory Be Prayer to St. Michael and several different versions of an act of contrition.

No he willed to withhold the exercise of his limitless and awesome power out of his limitless and awesome love and compassion.

Again the Immaculate Conception is not a teaching that Mary did not need to be saved by Jesus but rather that she was save so perfectly that she was prevented from any stain of sin.

1008985,0,t1_chir4xs,Yes it is. Its only marriage equality if samesex relationships are essentially equivalent to heterosexual relationships. Since its marriage were talking about the matter of children is extremely relevant. If childrearing outcomes are substantially different its a good sign that the relationships are substantially different too. SSM proponents make a stupendous logical leap to assuming that samesex relationships are exactly the same but yet never argue or present evidence in favor of it. Its really quite plain that men and women are substantially different from each other and thus gender is a very relevant factor in marriage. Arguing that this isnt true is one hell of an uphill battle it cant simply be asserted as truth.Edit Im just clarifying I dont necessarily support the specific line of argument in the video. Generalizing from singleparent to SSM is tough. However if two parents are better than one why wouldnt three be better than two? Or four? To argue that somehow two is the magic number and gender doesnt matter is another substantial logical leap with no evidence or reasoning behind it.,Catholicism,chiz9mf,1,t5_2qi4f

1043923,0,t3_261c1i,Im going to be in the minority of opinions here but heres my take. We dont need natural law for our morality.  In truth what we follow is Christian ethics which have their ultimate source as the praxis of the early church am I giving away my Christian Existentialist leanings?.  It is not as if we have a body of teleological morality with a Christian icing.  The whole reason we follow natural law is that it is ultimately confirmed by Christian morality.  The truth is we use natural law to give a more palatable explanation for our ethics.  Its easier to follow Chrisitian morality when you have clear examples seen in nature look at dogscats they only have sex for procreation.  The main issue I have with natural law and why I think it should be dropped is that with the corpus of natural phenomena it is possible to reason correctly to Christian ethics however it is possible to reason incorrectly to something else.  Natural law ultimately has its power in flawed and darkened human reason whereas Christian ethics has the divine light.  For a more official version of this The precepts of natural law are not perceived by everyone clearly and immediately. In the present situation sinful man needs grace and revelation so moral and religious truths may be known by everyone with facility with firm certainty and with no admixture of error. The natural law provides revealed law and grace with a foundation prepared by God and in accordance with the work of the Spirit. paragraph  of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  Because of the present situation I think it would be best if we were to let natural law quitely sit in the back of theology textbooks.  When using it in apologetics often we are rightly accused of disengenous argumentation.  In truth when we talk about natural law we should say natural law when confirmed by the teaching of the Church is consistent with the teachings of the church.  not a statement of much worth.. See my above point.  The truth is we can only be certain natural law is right when confirmed by faiththat is why we give creedence to the natural law in the first place.  For example here is a small wiki on animals that masturbate  It is entirely possible to make a natural law argument that masturbation is fine because look at how many animals use the sexual faculty for pure pleasure.  However when views throught the eyes of Christian ethics and the praxis of the early Church the above argument is not acceptable.. In my experience with  years of philosophy as my major in undergrad it is because essentially natural philosophy is the equivalent of a Rorschach test.  You can look at the natural world from a Catholics perspective and see nothing but Christianity.  You can see it from a secual atheists view and see nothing but cold calculated utilitarianism.  A philosophy which gives such contradictory ends is not seen as having much value.. Sadly I dont have any book recommendations.,Catholicism,chmy5v3,5,t5_2qi4f

1068049,0,t3_26c5hs,We can start with the Catechism.  Paragraphs  describe Jesus relationship to the Temple as followsgt  On the threshold of his Passion Jesus announced the coming destruction of this splendid building of which there would not remain one stone upon another. By doing so he announced a sign of the last days which were to begin with his own Passover. But this prophecy would be distorted in its telling by false witnesses during his interrogation at the high priests house and would be thrown back at him as an insult when he was nailed to the cross.gt  Far from having been hostile to the Temple where he gave the essential part of his teaching Jesus was willing to pay the Templetax associating with him Peter whom he had just made the foundation of his future Church. He even identified himself with the Temple by presenting himself as Gods definitive dwellingplace among men. Therefore his being put to bodily death presaged the destruction of the Temple which would manifest the dawning of a new age in the history of salvation The hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. Footnote  in the version on the Vatican website reads as followsgt  Jn  cf. Jn  Mt  Heb  Rev .I think that the citation Mt  is an error.  My print version cites Mt  and I believe based on context that the latter scripture citation is correct.  Although nothing is stated explicitly context makes clear that one approved interpretation is that the tearing of the veil recognizes that the Temple would be destroyed and replaced by the new temple which is Christ himself as we see in Rev .  Another source of information while not infallible is the Church Fathers.  St. Leo the Great wrote in his Sermon  that the tearing of the temple veil signified the end of the Temple and that all people could now approach God  gt You drew all things unto You Lord for the veil of the temple was rent and the Holy of Holies existed no more for those unworthy highpriests so that type was turned into Truth prophecy into Revelation law into Gospel. You drew all things unto You Lord so that what before was done in the one temple of the Jews in dark signs was now to be celebrated everywhere by the piety of all the nations in full and open rite.St. Augustine writes in Exposition on Psalm  that it was not to no purpose that when He was crucified the veil of the temple was rent in the midst but to show that through His Passion the secret things of all mysteries were opened and cites  Corinthians Finally a quote from the Liturgy of St. James  gt We thank You O Lord our God that You have given us boldness for the entrance of Your holy places which You have renewed to us as a new and living way through the veil of the flesh of Your Christ.

1093791,0,t3_26mlav,This is an area where I dont fully understand the Churchs logic.It seems to me that in this case we should figure out whether it is moral to avoid having a child under these circumstances.  If the answer is yes then why would there be a difference between NFP and a nonarbortifacent contraceptive?  Of course abortifacents and abortion are totally out of the question.  I understand one distinction is supposed to be openness to procreation.  But first of all if the answer to the initial question is yes I.e. if in this case it is a moral decision to avoid having a child then why is such openness still an issue?  Second NFP is often touted as having greater effectiveness in avoiding unplanned pregnancies.  If so and if using a contraceptive is not open to procreation then a fortiori how is NFP being open to procreation?  Ive heard one argument that using barriers makes it normally impossible to have children.  On the other hand isnt it just as impossible to have children in the wrong part of the ovulation cycle? Thats the whole premise of NFP after all.Third I think many people would agree that a contraceptive is not a guarantee that there will be no pregnancy.  My friend and my brother can attest to that!  So why is using a contraceptive considered opposing divine will?  As has been said here it takes  to make a baby therefore I think if God really intended for the couple to conceive it will happen contraceptive or not and viceversa.Fourth if in case of pregnancy the couple will keep the baby with possible exception in case the mothers life hangs in the balance isnt that open to procreation?tldr the nfp rule seems to put form above substance.  I dont understand the logic of it.Im definitely open to being corrected.  If you can point out to me the error of my logic or some resource that might help that would be great.

Say for instance... Joey and Grace have been dating for two years and they just had a rough break up and now there is a lot of drama in the youth group.  One night after small groups Joey and Grace get into a fight with each other.  What will you do to diffuse the situation? Sophia has a gay friend named Michael and he wants to come to a youth group meeting.  Unfortunately he chooses to come to a night when you are addressing the Churchs teaching on samesex attraction.

But she does not adhere to all of Church teachings and is often very vocal about how she is in favor of birth control and a womans right to choose.  Seeing as she is an example to your youth how will you address her continued vocal disobedience to Church teaching?

During the panel the Dominican and the Jesuit get into a fistfight while the Franciscan attempts to lead liturgical dance and the Carmelite runs to a corner and flogs himself in a form of penance.

1144349,0,t1_chyb3l5,gt but could you please point out to me where the author makes the argument that Our Lady of Fatima is an authoritative doctrine?OKgtIn  Our Blessed Mother appeared to three children in Fatima and she revealed to them the reality of hell in a vision.Not Was claimed to have appeared or is believed to have appeared but Appeared as statement of FACT. Making a claim of certainty about the appearance of Mary as Our Lady of Fatima along with a factual assertion of what she revealed is to make a claim of TRUTH. I thought I would clarify since the writer makes an implied claim of Objective Truth by saying Mary DID appear and DID reveal these things that in fact is not held as Objective Truth in the Doctrine of the Faith and may be disbelieved without dissent from the Church. Second in quoting the text it is quoted thus Our Lady showed us in the context of a letter from the CDF citing therefore those were the words of the CDF when in fact the text isnt from a declaration of the CDF but a translation of a letter within the CDF letter. So it should have been quoted at a minimum with   to show it was the CDF document quoting something else not making an original proclamation in the name of the CDF. I found that section to be very misleading and strongly implying that Our Lady of Fatima could or has been used to settle a doctrinal issue of faith Which the occupancy and population of Hell is and quite simply She cannot. To be clear Im not arguing against his premise I tend to agree with the author about Hell.

Seeds that can germinate are alive. The process of being a seed germination and growth as a sapling into a tree is a continuous and ahem organic process just as the implantation of the zygote development of fetus and birth as a baby is a continuous process.

But when the disciples saw it they were indignant saying Why this waste?  For this ointment might have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor.  But Jesus aware of this said to them Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me.  For you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me.  In pouring this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial.  Truly I say to you wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world what she has done will be told in memory of her.

In some respects my issue is that Orthodox theology seems more beautiful and more focused on the healing of the person rather than what seems to be a sort of legally based theology found within Catholicism though I am wondering if I misunderstand what Catholic theology actually teaches in that regard.

Its more the office of the papacy that I feel uncertain about.

Rather scripture says that the CHURCH is the pillar and foundation of truth.  That couldnt very well be the Southern baptists.  They didnt exist back then after all.

On the contrary the plaintiff has the burden of proving his case. Not attributing a work is not the same as cheating in court.  I have no idea where you got that.  I am talking about what happens before a lawsuit occurs. Attribution is not required under the law ever.  It doesnt give you any kind of defense it doesnt minimize damages.  What attribution does is that it proves to the copyright holder that you knew what you were doing was copyright infringement it makes your infringement easier to find for the copyright holder and it eliminates the innocent infringement and independent creation defenses.  Normally a plaintiff would have to prove ownership of a valid copyright and that the defendant had opportunity and means to copy but with attribution you prove the plaintiffs case for him.As far as legal ethics goes I am required to zealously defend my clients position within the law and provide for him advice that is best and legal.  It would be unethical for me to derail his case and assist the other side in seeking money damages.  My job is to protect him.  Telling him not to give attribution particularly if he does not know if some person is the real owner of a work and not someone who claims to be without actually registering his copyright is not the same as filing court papers or testifying on the stand to a falsehood.  Thats illegal unethical and immoral.  That is different and there is no basis for giving attribution. Some artists may wish others to give attribution to further their pride or make it easier for them to bring lawsuits against others but no one ever has to do that.  Thats the law and I advise people to follow it.  Its not an underhanded court tactic and it is ethical. I can see how legal strategies can seem like underhanded tactics when you dont understand them very well.

Although I guess you could say proof by construction uses evidence because the constructed example is both overt and measurable then again. So you win Go grab a beer! youve found a case where an idea being both overt and measurable is not necessarily physical but remains in idea form. FTR Math proves many things without using construction. Bottom line is though and more to my point before your snide got in the way.

Potential for authority isnt the same as an actual authority. You have no authority. You have a claim to Gods authority based on your rights. gtHe has a lot of Godgiven authorities that  despite them coming from God  are possessed by him.Yes holy orders are an explicit And scripturally delineated case of true delegation of Authority. No person not in possession of Holy Orders can assert they possess the Authority of God they may lay claim to Gods authority but they do not possess it. That is exactly what I meant when I explicitly explained in my last comment Persons who have the Authority of God are Clergy. gtTwo conflicting moral claims cannot possibly exist.

Whats nice about much newer DRM such as with iTunes or Amazon Music is that the DRM essentially tells you what is and is not okay to do with your purchase.

1558992,0,t1_cjbos6d,I assume youre talking about Matthew . This is the FairMormon response Mormon apologetics Jesus teaching about the rock is not a reference to any individual church or group of believers since even wellintentioned mortals must fail. Christ is the only sure foundation upon which a church can be built and the knowledge of Christ must come as it always has as it came to Peterby direct revelation from the Father. Christs Church will then be built upon those who have such revelation of Christ including prophets and apostles. The gates of hell prevailing against the church must refer to keeping the church in or out of the Hades the dwelling place of departed spirits. Gates do not force people to enter or leave but they do keep people from going in or out.

But entertainment goods are unique because there is an infinite supply. No matter how many times a film is legally or illegally viewed there are always more copies that can be made ad ifinitum.While we may refer to people consuming media it has a different definition than when we consume food for example. When you consume food the food item literally disappears. It can no longer be used. Neither you nor the producer is able to use the food item any longer. It has literally been consumed. However when we consume media both the original owner and the consumer still have access to the item. The item has not degraded in any way.

1850688,0,t3_2frdai,. Not sure what this question is really asking. We are moral because we are human beings with intellect and will  this enables us to understand what the good is for us and to choose to follow it or not. Other beings merely follow the good which is determined for their nature without understanding or comprehending it  see plants which grow and reproduce without having intellectual capacities. We are intrinsically moral beings in the sense that we have this power on the other hand we are moral in the sense of good insofar as we exercise it properly. Now morality is the relationship between a human act to our last end and our last end is happiness and ultimately the happiness that only God can bring. An act is good insofar as it leads us toward this happiness and bad insofar as it leads us away from it. But this happiness is something that everyone necessarily wants as a human being so the drive to be a moral good person is inherent in human nature. Thus we strive to be good people because we are people in the first place people with a nature capable of morality read nature capable of apprehending the good and choosing to follow it.. The arguments that God exists and that the soul is immortal are separate and thus one does not immediately imply the other. However it can be established on independent nonrevelation grounds that the soul is immortal this is because the soul contains the faculty of the intellect which is the capacity to receive or take into itself universals or essences. But for a piece of matter to receivetake into itself a universal or an essence is merely for it to be that thing thus if our intellect were material when we think of the nature of cats our mind would become a cat. In fact our intellect is not material this is why we can consider the essence of cats in our intellect without our intellect actually taking the form of what we are thinking about. And being immaterial our intellect does not contain any principle of corruption for matter is that which is capable of taking on another form. Thus our intellect is constituted in such a way that it will stay in existence perpetually unless God ceases to will its existence.. Not sure how to answer this immediately but the soul remains individualized after death due to its association with a specific piece of matter the human body which it is destined to reunite with.. Only with us. Measurable mental states are correlations with our actual intellectual acts not identical to our intellectual acts. That is a measurable mental state is an abstraction from what is actually occurring in the intellect and only points as a sign to the intellects activity. It is not in fact the intellects activity itself.,Catholicism,ckc7c3l,4,t5_2qi4f

Though I live in Texas so until recently its been too hot for one.gt What would this mean? I barely understand Vatican II except for the fact that it was badly misinterpreted by many leading to liturgical abuse much less what an Eastern Vatican II would look like.What I mean is a potential wholesale renovation of an entire Churchs liturgy and traditions. This happened to the Latin church in the s and nobody could do anything about it because it was imposed by Rome. The worry of the Orthodox is that if they accepted papal supremacy someone in Rome wielding the popes authority might want to modernize i.e. ruin the Orthodox liturgy.gt Just curious how do the Orthodox view Protestants and the nonOrthodox Churches of the East not sure if there are any of those left?In terms of salvation there is no official Orthodox position on those outside the Church. Of course you can find opinions spanning the entire spectrum of that answer. gt Kind of a side question how can there be many churchesrites within either Orthodoxy and Catholicism and it still be considered one visible Church as opposed to the myriad of Protestant sectsdenominations?The way Orthodoxy expresses unity is through shared faith and intercommunion and commemoration. For example the Russian church and Greek church are completely independent of each other but they believe the same things and the heads of each Church commemorate one another in their liturgies. At each patriarchal liturgy a list called a diptych is read that contains the names of all other patriarchsmetropolitansheads of local churches that that patriarch is in communion with. For example here is the list for the Orthodox Church in America. A prerequisite to being listed in the diptychs is professing the Orthodox faith. So we would consider any local church in that list as a part of the universal whole even though they are administratively independent. I hope that makes sense.,Catholicism,ckeoeta,2,t5_2qi4f

2092486,0,t1_cl5qyfp,Ill refer to the Archdiocese of Philadelphias lovely chart that uBounds so kindly provided for us. Point  refers to whether UND Intends the immoral act i.e. the equating of lifelong homosexual partnerships to natural marriages to occur.  I cant speak for UND but if they had intended to endorse gay marriage Im sure they wouldnt have phrased their statement as Notre Dame is a Catholic university and endorses a Catholic view of marriage. However it will follow the relevant civil law. At any rate I cant judge the universitys intent and neither can you.  The morality of the marriage law has no bearing on this particular point.You have already conceded that point  doesnt apply.Point  is where the real contention lies. Does UND make a contribution to the act that leads to the commission of the act? Strictly speaking theyre only providing benefits after the fact to couples that have already obtained civil marriage licenses. Remember the very act of giving someone health insurance is not in and of itself immoral. It is only immoral insofar as it alters the public view on marriage either directly by causing a gay couple to apply for a civil marriage license or indirectly by altering the publics view on the nature of marriage. Is this indirect incentive enough to meet this standard? Im not qualified to answer that. Were I in Notre Dames shoes I would err on the side of caution not extend the benefits and let the chips fall where they may.

I already read it in its entirety the first time I dont need you to parrot it back.gtthis man is individually responsible for the ethnic cleansingThat is precisely what I am contesting. Zinn titles his chapter and lays the blame of genocide at Columbuss feet. Yet I ask why is Columbus the man responsible and upon what grounds are you damning him as a genocidal maniac? Because at one time he truthfully observed in his journal that with  men he could subjugate an entire population?You extrapolate the history that you want to hear as does Zinn. We already know the Indian people were annihilated and I agree this is distant and buried in the past. That does not mean that the way to reignite passion and awareness is generating a new mythology to supplant the old. I get it you wish to blame someone. It doesnt fit well with you that there may be no single person to blame. That doesnt make it fitting to lay the charge of genocide solely on the shoulders of Columbus because he was . the mariner who happened to introduce the continent to Europe and . was the shitty governor of murderous colonies of convicts shipped there from Spain. What is the actual story about this genocide? If you want to learn a lesson from this learn this one it is not merely greed or commercial interest that kills it can in part be simply when totally foreign worlds collide.  When communication becomes impossible when natives retaliate on intruders and intruders demand recompense when you find yourself in a foreign land and faced with starvation and your subjects are armed with technology superior in every way. They didnt have any prime directive. Most if not all of them had no idea what they were getting into when they signed up to go to the Americas and were thoroughly pissed at Columbuss optimism and exaggerations. Do you believe you are a better governor than the evil Christopher Columbus? Then what would you do when your colonists murder natives and you are faced with starvation without their help? What would you do when the natives attack you in retaliation and the colonists demand that you respond with greater force to protect them? All of this with your home and your backup and the actual root of your authority an entire world away? But you would be able to get out of that situation easily because you are not cruel and evil correct?You dont care about that. To you he was simply a greedy genocidal maniac who is equivalent to Hitler who packed his own healthy citizens onto train cars and gassed them by the millions. No. Distance and time does not excuse immorality nor does it right wrongs but history can helps us to understand what went wrong so that we may not repeat it. Zinns interpretation is one interpretation but you and he have not offered much reason for me to take it as true. You overlook so many factors that we know for a fact about Columbus and the colonies that I cannot take you seriously when you try to portray Columbus as your own caricature a greedy cruel and evil man. That might make you feel better because you dont see yourself as greedy cruel and evil. But if you see him as just a man you might be a little wiser. I can imagine Columbuss story happening today I can imagine a new encounter not intending ill not driven solely by greed but resulting in disaster due to inability for worlds and technologies to unite. Hell half of Star Trek is about that. History is about truth and the usefulness of that truth. It is not about selfflagellation to make us feel better and convince ourselves that if we just arent as greedy as those old evil people then we will all be hunky dory.,Catholicism,cl8s4pb,0,t5_2qi4f

2127645,0,t3_2jby4n,Well as a personal note. Homosexual traditionally has been used to define positive action in that it not only describes sexual attraction someone is inclined to but also the activity in which they participate. Which is why Same Sex Attraction has been used to distinguish the inclination from action. What I and I think others fear is that in coming to a language and way of speaking more open to and accepting of people who have same sex attraction we cannot give the impression that their choice to indulge their sexual attractions are accepted by the Church. No matter what pretext monogamous civilly committed or otherwise this sexual behavior manifests. Conceptually welcoming language and gradualism should just be a more inviting road to the same immutable destination of Chastity. And as much as anyone who cannot or will not repent of mortal sin is in desperate straights this too must be maintained in the gradualistic approach moving the persons involved toward acceptance of their error repentance of their sin and consequently salvation. Which means accepting the call to Chastity even if like many it is struggled with. My fear is that Tolerate will be used as a synonym for Ignore and these serious errors will simply not be ministered to and that the persons who carry them will unapologetically and obstinately carry them to their Judgement for silence of the Church. I am more scared to be quite honest about the discussion of remarried Divorcees. Particularly adopting the Orthodox approach which is a clear error and cooperation with evil. I understand the benefit of a second union in some circumstance but the bottom line is sexual relations in such a union are adultery. Period. That is immutable. Someone who knowingly unrepentant in mortal sin IS cut off from the sacraments whether the Church wishes to enforce that or not. That is also Immutable. The Church should not in any way no matter what the tertiary benefits of said union might be be vague in quasi condoning sexual relationships in these subsequent union as the Orthodox do. In this case too persons must be brought to understand their error and they need to accept that Chastity is their calling and their sexual relations are illicit and sinful. Ultimately obstinately persisting that there is nothing wrong with what they are doingis what places them in serious danger. In all cases so involved in the Irregular relationships and the Church cannot be an active party in that for everyones sake. ,Catholicism,cla9qo0,9,t5_2qi4f

2215994,0,t1_cllg40b,gtThe format of the mass has changed dramatically from the beginning until Trent. Had the mass been a static entity for  years I would have a very different opinion on the matter.Well in pointing out Im wrong you in fact are wrong in that you rebuke something I never said. I didnt say the mass hadnt suffered any changes over those  years now did I? Nor did I say that if you took the whole of those changes over those  years that it wouldnt indicate mass had changed quite a bit over the years. I said The Latin Rite has been saying mass in Latin since the s. I had specifically framed the discussion as the mass in Latin was doing of something a certain way I never implied this extended to every Rubric of the  Missal. Now if you really want to push this point I can say that the Missal of Paul VI is the most radical single change to a missal that has ever occurred that I know of. I know of no changes to the way in which Mass is celebrated from the Church fathers to this day that were as far a departure from the preceding existing celebration as the Novus Ordo Missae. Which is probably a contributing factor in why it is not well loved by many. The number of changes made were probably over ambitious for a single change cycle and therefore difficult to implement well and the changes were led by Annibale Bugnini a man openly hostile to many traditional elements of Catholicism. Indeed we would be very woeful if his additional plans to rewrite the Hail Mary and reduce the Rosary to  decade had succeeded.gtI do not have an informed opinion on the matter. I am not trying to express an opinion on the matter. The following statements in your post are your opinion. . There appears to be a movement to revert to the extraordinary rite.. Locally this movement is nonexistent. this movement is strongest in the US. the US is a Protestant nation. there is disagreement on how far back we should be going.. most of the Vatican II changes to the liturgy either reverted the liturgy to a much earlier form. or clear away seemingly superfluous elements. the ordinary rite is not inconsistent with the history or traditions of the Church.  I do not see anything in my reading that makes the extraordinary rite seem more appealing.The last one I particularly rebuked as probably being formed with insufficient knowledge. So if you werent trying to express opinions you fared poorly. gtI came here because I wanted to be informed.

That church is led by the Holy Spirit. That Holy Spirit has deemed that artificial contraception cannot be used. Now the nontheological side artificial contraception has led to a more promiscuous society. This has led to a cheapening and devaluation of real sexual intimacy. It has also led to an increasing number of affairs abortions miscarriages etc. Often so called contraception prevents a fertilized embryo a life in the eyes of many from being implanted and thus it is expelled. The first step to an acceptance of abortion is wide spread use of contraception. Marriage used to be seen as the sole domain of sexual activity and the creation of children however contraception has lessened the perceived value of marriage. Cohabitation has increased as has out of wedlock births resulting from these relationships. Lastly widespread contraception use has or is leading to a crisis of low birth rates in many countries. The children that should have been or are not being born in many countries is leading to economic fallout and a lack of workers to support the aging population.

But for the first people created with souls marrying creatures that were merely genetically compatible with humans obvious ramifications since metaphysically speaking they are not human beings they dont have an eternal soul.

Theres some amazing reporting for youandgtNow the sharpened stick and face paint comes out... His strident discourse and preference of fancy oldfashioned vestments contrast starkly with the informal chatty tone and simple almost Spartan style Francis has established for his papacy. I wonder if AP has done a story about how much more it costs for Pope Francis to live in the Casa Santa Marta than in the Apostolic Palace.No they probably havent and maybe they should but I think this is Fr. Z trying to make Pope Francis seem lower in an attempt to make Cdl Burke seem better.gtLast month Burke marshaled conservative criticism against the possibility the Vatican may loosen up rules that ban Communion for divorced remarried Catholics. The Vatican... sigh.  What really happened is that Card. Burke defended the Churchs perennial teachings.While the Vatican was a poor choice of words and I make no secret around here of not sympathizing with roughshod journalism Fr. Z gives me the impression that he thinks Cdl. Burke was for the orthodox church and people against him were against orthodoxy. Also this would have been a great chance for Fr. Z to call out the APs use of the political term conservative where it has no place.gtHe has also questioned Francis denunciation of excesses of capitalism. I dont know when he did that.

2327026,0,t1_clz6rdc,I want to reiterate that this statement by MikeTheMoose is correct.Some individuals after PJs sermons that established his Theology of the Body sought to make human sexuality complicated. It isnt. Be fruitful amp multiply. There isnt anything complicated there. If you get married be with your spouse. Thats all there is to it. It isnt complicated. For some people the lower appetites will play a greater roll in circumstance when those events happen. Some people need reminders or to be drawn to something that is good. Some people need to be urged toward an end. And since some people would never eat or have sex unless it felt good God gave us those desires after the fall those desires became quite essential for the human race to carry on. Thus my statement above about vulgar acts.When MikeTheMoose said unless it becomes disordinately focused on physical gratification rather than full loving union this is true but I wouldnt worry a whole lot about that. Just think in the generality If I put myself before others I am not imitating Our Lord and then apply it to all places including the bedroom.Like I said it isnt complicated and there is no reason why it ought to be made so.I also read the article and cannot find any error in the article. I think it is the case of misunderstanding the point of the author. He is dealing with philosophy and applying it to sexuality and so I think maybe the confusion is due to not being familiar with from where the author draws his statements.Just think about this Before the fall when man acted it was because the light of reason said an act was good and so man acted to be good. After all he knew no sin. After the fall man became disordered. He began to desire good things but in disordered ways. Thus we have the seven deadly sins direct effects of the disorder we experience because of original sin.Because our light of reason was damaged a lot of people would just not eat or have sex because their reason was sufficiently dimmed. So God permitted that they would also experience carnal desire for these things. When these desires are directed toward the end that is good that is nourishment of the body or procreative union with our spouse they are good. If you lay with your wife merely because you both desire the act that is good  but a greater more ordered good would be to do it because the goodness itself and not the desire.Since we are fallen creatures those desires endup misdirected sometimes. We seek a good in a disordered way. Before marriage some men have the great desire for sex but cannot morally engage in the act. They could burn in their passion and fall into sin. So marriage is a way of fighting the concupiscence the desire to do disordered and sinful things. Being with your spouse should lessen your desire to be with someone you are not married to.What the author is fighting is the notion of some that we should celebrate these carnal desires. We have these desires because after the fall they became necessary. They are necessary because of original sin. These desires are good when they are directed to the correct end but that is also often not the case. Many a priest will attest to the volume of sins pertaining to disordered carnal sexual desires. Some consider it the primary way the devil lures souls to hell. So instead of celebrating the desires we should be celebrating the end that they ought to be directed new human life and marital unity.,Catholicism,clzc0l4,7,t5_2qi4f

2341647,0,t1_cm0kzbu,gt You note a number of borderline cases which involve specific physical birth defects and then make the leap to people who simply believe that they are the other sex despite otherwise whole and functioning bodies.For starters I absolutely agree with you that simply believing that one is the opposite gender is not sufficient grounds to say that one is actually that gender. We have  right to choose our own gender. A delusion if that is all that it is must not be treated as more than a delusion.Therefore if you are right that this is a mental issue which manifests itself as a false belief about the body then I agree with your conclusion. But that is an asyet unsettled question. It will only be answered by scientists not philosophers or theologians.gt the absurd from a Catholic perspective conclusion that a correctly functioning male or female body is sometimes in fact itself a birth defect.Thats not quite accurate. Heres how I figure it might be. Emphasis on might because this isnt my field. in a healthy individual three things are in sync reproductive organs genes and brain. When all three agree on gender theres no conflict.The problem is we already know that it is possible for two of those things to fall out of sync. In the AIS mentioned above brain and reproductive organs are female but infertile I might add but genes are male. The defect if there is a defect does not reside in the very form of the body. It resides in the discord between two parts of the body. Kind of like an autoimmune disorder.The  question is this is gender identity disorder a brain issue or a psychological issue? If its a brain issue i.e. if we actually had a female brain in an XY body though Im sure thats grossly oversimplified then maybe the real gender of the person may be thrown into question.,Catholicism,cm151uy,1,t5_2qi4f

If humans keep breeding and moving around indefinitely and all the uncontacted tribes come into contact with the rest of humanity again then eventually we will get to the point where all humans are descended from someone who is alive today.

2569810,0,t1_cmtvysb,gtPerhaps not with God as God is eternalBut thats just it.  The Church was created to preserve and teach Gods teachings throughout the ages to preserve the teachings of the Apostles and thus the teachings of Christ himself.  We can figure things out so to speak as we did with the Trinity natures of Christ etc.  But although doctrine may develop it doesnt change to contradict itself.  The Trinity was just as much a reality in the time of Adam as it was in the time of Christ and as it is now.  So it is with all other doctrines.  The Church proclaims Gods Truth and that doesnt change.gtCatholics we should have the humility necessary to admit that we could be wrong on some things.Depends on what you mean by some things.  Can the Catholic Church be wrong on certain practices?  Of course as can be seen for example in its former selling of indulgences and perhaps even its current requirement in the Latin Rite for priests to be celibate  these are practices that are not definitive matters that pertain to faith and morals thus are welcome to change.  Where you are wrong is when you suggest that the Church can err on definitive matters of faith and morals  it cannot.  The Church has not reversed a single doctrine in its entire history  and for good reason because all of her doctrines are Truth.This isnt a matter of social justice as you seem to think.  The Church fortunately is not a democracy.  Feminists cannot make a woman able to consecrate the Eucharist anymore than the UN can no more than you or I can.gtMy soul is just as good as any mans soul.Absolutely Im not sure why you see the corollary of this as a natural consequence of Church teaching because its not.  A womans soul is just as good as a mans soul even though she cannot receive Holy Orders.  Similarly a mans soul is just as good as any womans soul even though he cannot for example birth a child.

The survival of people in the ancient world particularly a desert dwelling people like those in the Old Testament boiled down to three things the fertility of their fields the fertility of their herds and the fertility of their women.  Why do you think the Israelites constantly turned to worship the god Baal? You guessed it he was one of the regional gods of fertility.  To a people like the ancient Israelites I could not imagine a more powerful way for God to send a message concerning his power than to make something infertile fertile again.  Then in the last and most impressive recorded instance of this miracle God pulls out all the stops. Sarah Hannah Etc. were made fertile so their husbands could plant the seed of new human life as well as witness the ultimate power of God.  With Mary however God goes one step further and to use an analogy takes a field that had not even been sowed and makes it produce fruit.  God works his miracles in ways that those to whom he is speaking cannot misunderstand the depth of his power and what better way to demonstrate your power to an ancient people whose survival depended on fertility than to show your absolute mastery over fertility?,Catholicism,cn2cjew,10,t5_2qi4f

At some point I just started avoiding all ecchi tags both in manga and the little anime I watch. I admit I still read manga like Nisekoi . is fan service and its easily skipped past and TWGOK literally no fan service on any page and yes... Our an High School Host Club which although not ecchi or anything like it can all provide a distorted view of relationships. The love of characters in a romance manga is most likely not like real life in any way and obviously harems are not a good thing at all and no love can compare to the love of God. But yeah ecchi manga is definitely not good. Now if only there could be a manga about Scripture... Tags being Romance Action Drama Comedy road to emmaeus? Anyone? Adventure Historical?

2688078,0,t3_2qs4a2,The real key to sexual compatibility from a secular or religious perspective is a combination of lots of open communication patience an open mind and a willingness to please your spouse. You both need to communicate about what you like and what the boundaries are. You need to have an open mind to try new things within those moral boundaries. That openness needs to be balanced with patience. And you need to be willing to do things your spouse likes even if its not the thing that turns you on the most. Communication communication communication!Now it IS possible that your girlfriend might be hesitant to do sexual things because there is a huge focus on purity and chastity for young women. It can get twisted into something negative about sex entirely. Its not likely but it still happens. So the key to tackling this issue is guess what? more patience communication and openness.

2695880,0,t3_2qx6ul,gtWe still pray for rain in our parishes and atheists point and laugh and theyre right.If you dont want atheists to point and laugh youll need to stop doing rather more than that since they believe theres no god to pray to at all. Having said that Im not sure trying to avoid causing atheists to laugh at us is the reason to be Catholics. Jesus said people will hate us for what we believe. We believe Thy will be done. We pray for what we want for ourselves and others even though God already knows what we want before we pray it knowing that it is Gods will whether an event will happen and knowing that he can always prevent or cause something if he wills it providing its not against his nature or doesnt infringe our free will etc.. As believers in God as the single creator of everything it means we would believe that all of nature which comes under the heading of Everything is his work. Natural processes may well from timetotime be describable in scientific language in a cause and effect manner and much of scientific research seeks to do this and people can sometimes try to formulate laws which attempt to predict what will happen if X is done to Y. There is no guarantee that these will always be correct and even if something is indeed shown to be  reliable which nothing ever has or can ever be it will still have nothing to say about God since all that would have been achieved is a description of a process we believe God created.

2731018,0,t1_cnehuz9,No youre just failing to deal with any objections by saying they dont exist.No Im actually going to the source quoting your own sources and showing how they dont even back up your own claims but actually weigh against them.If the interbreeding solution for example is acceptable to Msgr. Pope then why would he say the polygenesis issue is a real reason for skepticism of evolution?Maybe because Msgr. Pope himself specifically defined polygenism as excluding a literal and historical first couple? Are you even reading what your own source writes and what I quote?Easy  because the Pope really did condemn it as a biological proposition not separate from but because of theological concerns.As I keep saying over and over the Pope condemned a polygenist view which treats the first couple as symbolic or which does not allow for a first couple. No matter how many times you quote HG while excluding the portions that make reference to Adam and Eve thats going to keep on coming right back to the forefront.Look dude...saying that I mean that the Pope is condemning scientific propositions for scientific reasons...thats really stupid.Truck read this and read it slowly the Pope was condemning a view of polygenism that ruled out a first couple as literal and historical from whom humanity was descended. If you fall back to Well polygenism as I define it is a totally scientific concept which has nothing to do with that! then I have bad news for you the Popes concern here wasnt with a wholly scientific concept or even wholly scientific claims but interpretations that specifically relate to theological issues of which Adam and Eve  a First Couple are central.Here let me spell out the problem for you if someone reads your tortured awkward reading of HG that goes against both the document itself and your own interpretors of the document theres a possible conflict. But on my reading the reading of Msgr. Pope as well as Feser theres a pretty straightforward reading  and no conflict. Thats going to force you to say If that interpretation is true okay then theres no conflict after all.From there its going to be a question of whether people believe the Pope was condemning all polygenism anywhere regardless of whether or not it retains a first couple from whom humanity descended or not.

So I think two atheists who get a state marriage and have kids still have a natural marriage.Any form of homosexual union will never be marriage and a good Catholic must fight against civil recognition of such marriages.

What do workers gain from their toil?  I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race.  He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart yeta no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.  I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live.  That each of them may eat and drink and find satisfaction in all their toilthis is the gift of God.  I know that everything God does will endure forever nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. I think that is a pretty good answer there. We all most and will and ought to and ought to want to die. Well if your catholic and you repent I should say. We are not meant to be on this earth for eternity. We are hear to love and praise God. We do this in part by raising families and teaching them to do the same and showing them love. There is a time for everything and I think that makes sense. Just because we can do does not mean we ought to. God gave Kain the ability to kill his brother but he was most displeased. He gave us the ability to murder unborn babies but we most certainly ought not do that. He gave Eve the free will to eat from the forbidden tree and cast us all into original sin but he cast them from the garden for this action was against His will. Perhaps we should not do things simply because we can. It makes sense to try and stomp out plague and pestilence but how do we know we are a live unless we are tested. If we can make it so we can live to a respectable age of natural existence that is fine beyond that and it has unappealing implications.

2952363,0,t1_co3ntmg,gt Apparently Ive been fooled by a big wall of text.Even Wikipedia repeats the same error. It is common because the schismatics want to fool people into believing their sacraments are valid.gt In general the sacraments retain the presumption in favor of their validity providing the essential conditions are met.Correct. The presumption is that sacraments are valid unless they are proven to not be. You see this a lot in annulment of marriage investigations. Those who are remarried are said to be in an invalid marriage because the presumption is that the first marriage is valid. It isnt until the first marriage is determined null that the second marriage can be validated.So what does this mean for sexual relations in the context of the new marriage? If the first marriage is presumed valid then you are presumed to be committing adultery with your new wife. This is why the Church encourages people in that situation to abstain. Once the first marriage is proven to be null and the new marriage is valid via radical sanation then it isnt adultery to sleep with your wife and never was. If the first marriage is proven to be null and the new marriage is valid only after administering the sacrament then it wasnt adultery to sleep with your wife but it was fornication prior to the validation. So you can see how when the presumption is clarified the consequences of the act become clear in retrospect. I would also like to point out that due to the circumstances the culpability of those involved in the marriage would most likely be reduced.All of this is to say that presumption of validity is not validity. Take in forma absoluta baptism for example. That process would not exist if presumption was enough. Therefore it would seem that the sacraments administered by someone without authority are simply presumed to be valid. The problem comes when the presumption of validity is clarified and determined to be null. In retrospect what happens to the sacraments that depended on this validity?To me it would seem that they would also be invalid. This means for example that the presumed absolution was never given to penitents. Given that this absolution was not given although sought by those contrite of heart Im sure God in his justice would not hold it against them however the fact remains absolution was never given. Following this line of thought that means that transubstantiation did not occur either. These are the things I seek to clarify.,Catholicism,co3p4d0,1,t5_2qi4f

He answers in the negative.I want to admit my Latin vocab for various sexual acts is imperfect Ive focused more on Christological themes when seeking out Latin texts so I may be imprecise here before I make the next claim so Im not sure about it. He seems to be talking about actual copulation or the spilling of seed in the mouth not simply foreplay  gt some kind of doubleorgasm or switching after orgasm has begun.His argument is based on the authority of a bunch of theologians I havent read Ive probably read some but he uses abbreviations for their names and not so much on an understanding he has of sexual activity.

They need to stop using the excuse of a difficult past for not performing today.  They also need to cater to regular people.  I sometimes attend a Byzantine Catholic parish.  Its largely filled with hyperconservative Latin Rite Catholics who have found refuge in this parish. Its downright sad to overhear bitter conversations about latinizations  something they have read about but not something that ever impinged upon this parish. The odd behavior of these people and not the small number of actual Easterners keeps others away.  Its a real issue.They need to make an effort to become part of the community in which they are located.  The little church I attend has ZERO ties with the community in which it exists.  It has no ties with neighboring Latin Rite parishes or Orthodox parishes. Yet in its eyes its all about being ignored.  They need to make an effort.

3217810,0,t1_covitna,The spam filter blocks innocents. My bad.   Here is the postA Strategy to Invite FallenAway Catholics BackIt is well known that the church is losing its youth and young adults in massive numbers. Many of these students leave church shortly after they graduate CCD receive the Sacrament of Confirmation and mistakenly perceive such as a finish line in their journey and not a starting point.I think we can get them back. This post details one such strategy.It Starts NowBut if you want to reach those lost congregants of your parish the time to start is now.This post is especially relevant for those who are you are in youth group ministry but it can very well apply to pastors and those looking to get involved with lay ministry.But I insist the time to start is right now. This is posted in the first week of Lent.Step  Organized PrayerThe first act of outreach as it always should be is Prayer.Studying the beginnings of all major revivals throughout history it is known that these awakenings were sparked from the actions of a concerted effort of praying individuals all joined together for a specific cause.As Catholics we have the benefit of praying directly before the Blessed Sacrament. Why not schedule an adoration service with considerable quiet time? Why not have a novena network? Have people pray specifically for a successful outreach project.And it goes without saying praying involves both active petitioning our Lord and listening. Perhaps He will inspire ideas amongst the team. Perhaps He will awaken specific needs amongst those whom you wish to target your outreach. It will be different for nearly every parish community.. Focus on the A amp P CatholicsEvery year its the same thing. These lost churchgoerswherever they are atthe vast majority of such congregants always come to at least four liturgies a year Ash Wednesday Palm Sunday Easter Sunday Christmas Eve.They have earned the term A ampamp P Catholics because they like getting ashes and palms. But they will most likely go to mass on Christmas and Easter as well.Perhaps there is still a spark of faith in such individuals that they will go to mass each year and then be done.What needs to be done for the outreach community is to provide somethinganything that these individuals would feel invited to.Now I get that many parishes will work very hard to ensure that the liturgies of these weeks will be at their highest quality especially in terms of having the best music they can muster or the best homilies that the priest can deliver. And I certainly hope that being in the presence of Jesus in the Eucharist would spark a renewal of faith a sense of homecoming.But that said since there is usually a dropoff of attendance between Easter Sunday and the second week of Easter it is likely that there needs to be something more that can be done.Ideas For FollowUpHow then to invite such individuals back to Church?I dont know. But you probably will.By saying I dont know I mean this is something that will be different for every parish depending specifically upon the needs of those individuals who will attend those liturgies and nothing more.This is why prayer is so important. God may spark ideas in your prayer walk that will give form to a plan that will best serve those individuals.But that said here are a couple of examples that can very well play out.Idea  Start a Young Professional GroupYou may live in an urban area where there are a lot of young twentysomething professionals. You may sense that the needs of these individuals is that they are lonely and desire to connect to their community but when they go to church they feel vastly outnumbered by those of different age groups.When they arrive on Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday announce from the pulpit and put in the bulletin a beginning social hour to meet other young professionals in your area. Provide a talk for that evening that speaks to them like How to Follow God Through Social Media or How to Find Your Spouse Gods Way something along those lines.When they come get their names and email addresses and survey them periodically on topics that they would want to hear.Idea  Start an Outreach SeriesIn my book  Unique Ways to Upgrade Your Catholic Youth Group I detail a list of series that one could attend to help them grow in the faith. Among these I include both Catholic and nonCatholic outreaches from The Life In the Spirit Seminars to The Purpose Driven Life.Why not start one of these series directly after Easter and make a big push for them during the weeks of Palm Sunday and Easter?And if the entire parish is invited make it known that there will be a small group set up specifically for those who are youth or young adults.The benefit of these programs is that a lot of the work has been done upfront and you do not need to reinvent the wheel. And they have had a powerful success rate.Idea  Provide a Great Resource For Them And Build Your Email ListIf you are unable to get organized for a big series in time you can still craft a PDF resource specifically for those whom you are targeting for outreach.Why not craft an article of the Top Ten Ways To Know God Today or How to Be Filled With Joy? Or find a novena that will speak directly to the needs of the youthyoung adults in the community and have that prepared.In the past these would be ordered for the parish and handed out at the end of mass. Instead mention from the pulpit and the bulletin that there is a great series that can be emailed directly to them.This lead magnet can be set up and delivered directly to those who ask by filling out their name and email list. Assure them that the email list will be used ethically and you will not spam them.But once you have the email list then you can begin surveying them directly as to their needs and concerns and create events or formulate talks that will speak directly to their needs.ConclusionAs you can see this takes effort and planning. It takes volunteers. It takes a concerted effort of prayer. And it takes time.Whatever road you take do not be afraid to try new things to try new approaches to help increase your outreach. But these decisions should be made in the midst of a praying community active and purposely focused.Being that those whom you are targeting will likely come to mass five or six weeks from now you have that amount of time to have somethinganythingready for them so that there may be a connection made and they may be inclined to return for something speaking directly to them.It starts now. ,Catholicism,covj0cy,6,t5_2qi4f

The school was a list of stereotypes all the teachers are Irish nuns who hit you with rulers.  Bart and Homer almost convert but are stopped by Reverend Lovejoy Flanders and Marge. Bart was mostly interested in Lives of the Saints comicbooks featuring violence and Homer was in it for the pancake suppers and forgiveness of sins.

You need to be able to see all the interactions of who she is as a person. Her gender race religion and socioeconomic status. Your inability to see fully from that perspective is compounded by your privilege. You as a white Catholic man are not a minority in any way and your voice and opinions are heard by those around you. So not only are blind to the others experience but you can freely voice your opinion on the matter. This is why she might come off as angry but it does not make you the enemy. Her hostility is simply trying to be herd alongside you and the power your voice commands due to your privilege. Calling yourself the enemy is victimizing and does not really add to the overall discussion of equality. You are not oppressed or discriminated.

This connection is almost entirely rooted in religious thinking.Uh. Its rooted in the fact that sex makes babies. Parenthood since the dawn of animals has pretty much always been the result of two parties having sex. The fact that science would very much like to unlink sex and babies doesnt mean that they are unlinked. gtExcept that in this case there is a clear capability to undo any unintended outcome.Sure at the expense of innocent human life. gtThe contrary is Is it acceptable to remove the right of a woman to have control over their own body?Okay and the right for the child to have control over its own body goes where...? gtDoes a brainless formless unconscious unfeeling All characteristics of earlystage development carry the same moral weight as a full human?These are all also characteristics of persons in a vegetative state. And considering that the brain is distinct by  weeks thats a fairly small window of time that theyre brainless and some women who arent expecting conception dont realize it until after this point especially if they dont show many symptoms. gtThis gets interesting quickly. For example if person A needs a liver transplant to live does heshe have the right to demand that person B gives part of their liver?If Person A is the child of Person B yes. Thats the a difference between pregnancy and any variation of the violinist argument. In fact if A is Bs child Id charge B with child neglect and manslaughter by refusing.

Id hazard a guess that we each know the arguments for both sides and how to refute them. A Reddit thread however well executed is not going to change my mind as Ive been on that side of the fence and probably isnt going to change yours.I think the real difference is how each side approaches the question of the value of human life. As you already stated most prochoice arguments are made from a utilitarian standpoint. Most prolife arguments are grounded in the fact that every human life at every stage from conception until death has value that is not dependent on consciousness development memory or any other qualifier.

To question Gods every action is not a good path to follow. However God made humanity to be imperfect but He had to have some perfect examples for us to follow so thats presumably why He made Mary and Jesus perfect.So then how is that fair? Doesnt God want us to be happy?Perhaps its not fair at all but thats besides the point. We are who we are because God wanted us to be that way but in being flawed we also have the unique opportunity of coming to know God through pain and suffering from sin. We can see how sin negatively affects our own lives and the contrast between good and evil from a first person perspective is something that not even Mary could really experience since she never sinned although she definitely did suffer in other ways.,Catholicism,cpi9b21,5,t5_2qi4f

Although Im not a libertarian and live in Europe it is immediately obvious that the articles claim that the church has always supported redistribution based on quotes by Leo XIII th century and Pius IX is clearly not supported by the evidence presented. Even a cursory reading of available evidence will point one to the decidedly earlier late scholastics who were very pro market. Furthermore the quote by Pius IX is not consistent for although he argues for forced redistribution his justification is protection of private property and the biblical admonitions to give alms.

People get lonely without being close to others so they seek others in romance.

3479763,0,t1_cposb50,Clarification It is immoral to kill an innocent person deliberately.  This is always true though especially true of children.  You may not even kill a person to save your own life. Suppose you are stranded on a desert island with no food and with one other person and you know that rescue will not arrive until shortly after you both starve to death.  It is not okay to murder your shipmate and eat his flesh to keep yourself alive.  Thats murder and both common law and the moral law recognize it as such.HOWEVER there is almost always another option especially when it comes to abortion.  You may never directly intentionally kill your own child  you cannot reach into a womb with scissors and cut out your babys brain stem. That would be murder duh. But you MAY for a just cause provide yourself with necessary medical care to treat a lifethreatening condition... even if the only available treatment is likely or even certain to cause the accidental death of your child.  This applies to several common scenarios where prochoicers would have us believe abortion is necessary to save a mothers life.  One such scenario is the one you describe mom needs chemo and radiation therapy to live but baby is almost certainly unable to survive the treatment.  After weighing the costs mom can go ahead and get the needed treatment and just pray that her baby lives through it.  Another one is the ectopic pregnancy mom cannot possibly survive to term and must stop being pregnant.  Choicers tell her to kill the baby deliberately and directly that there is no choice  kill or be killed. But thats not true mom can also have her fallopian tube surgically removed saving her life and then she and her doctors can do everything possible to save the nowborn premature baby.  This is often futile  ectopic pregnancy becomes lifethreatening often many months before the baby is even close to viable  but notice the difference between the prolife and prochoice views the prochoice view chooses to kill one to save another like a blood sacrifice in Aztec civilization.  The prolife view does everything possible to save both... but still makes the hard choices that mean moms live and babies  despite the best efforts of everyone involved  sometimes die.Any time someone presents you with abortion as the only way to prevent a mother from dying they are selling a bill of goods.  Abortion is never okay but even if it were it would never be necessary. ,Catholicism,cpox2g2,3,t5_2qi4f

3668504,0,t1_cqa60xg,gt If your culture has decided tights and a sports bra nonsexual clothing that joggers wear and you are a runner wearing those close you are practicing modesty. One important thing to recognize is that while it is true that modesty can vary by culture the mere fact of something being culturally pervasive does not indicate that it is modest. For example certain varieties of swimwear may be prominent despite the fact that they are not modest. In this case the approbation of the culture is not of their modesty but that they should be worn despite their immodesty this is why the cultural context while important is not the final word.gt If your culture has decided at weddings only the groom wears a tuxedo and you show up at someone elses wedding in a tux you are being immodest.That sounds like an excessive expansion of the concept of modesty. In the Catechism this appears under the section the ninth commandment and subsection the battle for purity. The surrounding sections are replete with references to sexual dignity and chastity as opposed to voyeurism excessive exposure etc. The tuxedo example is more of an inappropriatedisrespectful violation of a custom like for example speaking to a person who occupies a higher social position than you with very informal language rather than immodesty.,Catholicism,cqafn50,1,t5_2qi4f

If they want to they can quite a few Christian denominations already preform same sex marriages but if a Church doesnt want to they shouldnt have to.The law does not prevent clergy from marrying gay couples at all it allows them to marry gay couples if they want to. All it says is it will allow the Churches to choose who they marry that the state wont force marriage rules on the Church. Thats it.Here is the exact clause in the bill relating to thatE. Unless otherwise prohibited by law no person who is authorized by law to perform or solemnize a marriage shall be required to perform or solemnize any marriage in violation of his or her right to the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. No church or qualified churchcontrolled organization as defined pursuant to  USC  shall be required to participate in a ceremony performing or solemnizing a marriage in violation of the religious beliefs of such church or qualified churchcontrolled organization.You can read the full bill here ,Catholicism,cqmd5d3,1,t5_2qi4f

3839906,1,t1_cqtsqs6,This is only a convincing answer if you already accept the premise that homosexual acts are sinful. You would do well to explain why that is the case. The slightly longer answer is that the Church teaches that sex is defined by two things unification and creation.  Unification should need no real description it causes chemical stimulation that helps people reach a mental state to bring them together. The creative piece is about being open to new life. This is the same reason abortion and contraception are also considered poor options. The fact of the matter is that there is no official ban on homosexual acts the law is more positive than that. The law states that relations between a husband and wife are the proper venue for sexual relations and that the emotionally healthiest way in the long term to do so is to be open to life.Homosexual acts may be unitive but they can never be creative on their own the biology simply isnt there.  These acts are missing from the action homosexual acts arent considered to fall under the definition of marriage and are considered unhealthy or at the least sub optimal. ,Catholicism,cqtzec3,3,t5_2qi4f

3869208,1,t1_cqx9vbr,As an outsider a selfdeclared almost Catholic Ive never understood why on the issue of say Liberation Theology where were talking about using the tools of the state to help the poor the most common statement heard amongst the Catholic community from my vantage point has been that the Church doesnt need the state and that Statebased solutions are actually borderline heretical. Meanwhile on this subject the opinion you espouse i.e. that the Church does not need to recognize a Statesponsored marriage except perhaps in administrating medical care at a hospital seems to be a tiny minority. The common wisdom on that is that the State derives its power from the people who are served and thus a Statebased blockade of nonsponsored types of marriage is necessary.I will admit that to me analysis of the idea of the New Covenant and Supersessionism tend to speak to me with the idea that because we no longer live in an age of the Levitical Covenant and Levitical Law I have no problem with SSM. To a certain extent I dont see threeparty marriages as inherently blocking a person from finding salvation in Christ but remain unconvinced that all of ones obligations to the Lord can be fulfilled in this way.Regardless I understand that my thoughts are not in line with Catholic teaching but Id love to hear someone explain a resolution to the first problem I pointed out that of seeming to both need and not need the State.,Catholicism,cqxbney,3,t5_2qi4f

3970294,0,t1_cr8gnpx,gtThe inability of the Church to recognize a Jewish state or religion has nothing to do with the Pope having Jewish friends or that the Vatican established diplomatic relations with Israel Maybe I wasnt clear. JPII grew up in Wadowice with numerous Jewish friends and had lifelong friendships with numerous Jews.After the assassination attempt on JPII when he was still in the hospital Jerzy Kluger came to visit him and JPII asked him to help him work behind the scenes to bring about the formal recognition by the Vatican of Israel.Again Vatican diplomats in the Secretariat of State are primarily diplomats not clergy the reluctance to even so much as use the words state of Israel in any publication or official speech by a Vatican representative including the Pope  let alone establish full diplomatic ties with Israel  was driven by politicaldiplomatic concerns and not religious ones. The Vatican diplomats were concerned that by formally recognizing Israel as a state there would be serious consequences even violence from other Middle Eastern countries one of their stated concerns was the safety of Christians in the Middle East in general and the Holy Land specifically.It is very true that at least for a long time before and several years after JPIIs election there was a large contingent of powerful officials at the Vatican particularly in the Secretariat of State who were at least antiSemitic enough to oppose the recognition of Israel.There are a few points Im trying to make. Although the Pope is equivalent to a monarch in practice he either cant or wont unilaterally give recognition to a nation in the case of OPs new article Palestine.. Despite your claim antiSemitism was a VERY common belief among many Catholics even right up to senior officials. At least until Jules Isaac began his work one could reasonably say that very few Catholics questioned the accepted narrative which may or may not have been the official narrative  I dont know that the Jews as a whole were responsible for Jesuss death and therefore had no right to return to the Holy Land. Its embarrassing to have to admit that we were wrong and that our former beliefs very likely were responsible for discrimination and violence  from putting Jewish people into ghettos to pogroms and right up to the Holocaust but that doesnt make it untrue. I would suggest that before trying to refute my claim you at least have a cursory read of Isaacs Jesus and Israel. Its available in ebook format in numerous places online and it clearly documents where the Catholic Church went wrong in believing Jews as a whole killed Jesus.. JPIIs Jewish friend Jerzy Kluger was instrumental in working behind the scenes primarily with contacts in the Vatican Secretariat of state that he was referred to by JPIIs personal secretary and with the Israeli embassy in Rome  and in particular the cultural minister. This New York Times article is a good summary of what he did.. To illustrate what I mean about Catholics previously believing that the Jews as a whole were responsible for Christs death I will relate this anecdote my source is The Hidden Pope but it is somewhat commonly known During the Vatican II debates on Nostra Aetate in Rome in  this exchange reportedly happened at a diplomatic function conservative Ernesto Cardinal Ruffini Archbishop of Palermo happened to encounter Nathan BenHorin who was First Secretary at the Israeli Embassy. BenHorins duties at that time related to the Italian Republic not the Vatican so it was on religious rather than diplomatic grounds that the cardinal greeted him.I understand Cardinal Ruffinni said cheerfully that we are about to pardon the Jews. Excuse me BenHorin replied but I wasnt feeling so guilty. This kind of condescending attitude towards the Jews was common at the time but was an improvement from in the past.. Lets assume for a minute that youre right and the official teaching of the Church was that the Jews werent responsible for Jesus death. That doesnt mean that the teaching was accepted by any meaningful percentage of Catholics and it doesnt mean that even the hierarchy accepted it just look at today where the Church has never been more clear on its teachings regarding things like SSM  contraception  abortion  etc. Not only do a substantial number of Catholics reject the Churchs teachings but even some BishopsArchbishops and Cardinals openly reject the teaching. Heck the president of the Germans bishops conference is quoted as saying the Synod cannot prescribe in detail what we have to do in Germany.Im getting off topic though. My original intention was to provide some insight into the behindthescenes diplomatic work leading up to the treaty with Palestine through extrapolation from the efforts needed for the Vatican to formally recognize Israel as a state.,Catholicism,cr8uhmy,1,t5_2qi4f

4070179,0,t1_crk46z1,gtBut some beliefs are required to get to attribute any authority over Truth to the Church in the first placeIm not sure what the point here is. The argument isnt that the authority of the Church is logically prior to all those things but rather that once youve accepted a sufficient part of the faith the rest must also be accepted and that large parts of it are predicated largely on that authority.gtTrue science is a quality we give to results produced scientifically that to the current state of our knowledge can be accepted as correspondent to reality. The value true or false is attributed to the results and then the quality true science can be attributed to them.This argument is circular. Youre defining science by whether it arrives at truth and implicit in your definition of truth as to the current state of our knowledge can be accepted as correspondent to reality is in itself an invocation of science in a broad sense. Youve defined scientific truth as what is arrived to by science and science as what arrives to scientific truth.What I meant by saying true science is not a quality of the results but a quality of the methods by which the results were reached. If you correctly apply the right methods have solid incorporation of your results in theory and get things like peer review and reproductions of your results you can know that you have arrived at a statement that is true.gtNo. Statement x is verifiably correspondent to reality as far as we can tell ergo we can attribute to it the quality of true science. Plants liberate O during photosynthesis isnt a statement you should believe because it was produced by True Science it is considered true science because it was verified to be real.Again see my above post. I think this too is a fundamentally circular argument. Believing in the Churchs authority over the truth is more akin to saying . This biochem lab has authority over scientific truth and can never be wrong about it. gt . This biochem lab made a given scientific statement. gt . This statement is true. Between  and  in science theres peer review experimental doovers and a lot of alreadyverified statements to back up the new one and  isnt even a thing.Youre interpreting the word science too narrowly in my posts. As I said above I am including all that verification and so on in what I meant by correctly applied scientific method.,Catholicism,crk87y1,3,t5_2qi4f

Victims take an active role in the process while offenders are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions to repair the harm theyve doneby apologizing returning stolen money or community service.  In addition it provides help for the offender in order to avoid future offences. It is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offence against an individual or community rather than the state.  Restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender shows the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability. gtgtImage iInteresting Restorative justice in social work | Howard Zehr | Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project | Prison Fellowship International Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcrolyb oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecrolyb.

I dont think being a priest is as difficult as being a doctor nor should it be.  If it were that difficult or really required that much schooling I think Id be seeing great orations or amazing theologians which Ive yet to see.  In my experience when discerning and vocation visits it seems like a lot of this time is cooling off time to help you discern if priesting aka celibacy is right for you.  With married men celibacy would already be off the table.  If protestant clergy can be educated with an M.Div. in  years I think Catholics certainly can too.  My local Episcopal Diocese is able to ordain people in  months for priesting.gton top of that expecting them to be essentially oncall at all times for emergencies.Two points. First I dont think priests are constantly being awoken at  am.  In fact I bet they perhaps lt calls like that a month.  Second your view here still thinks of one parish priest for a whole parish.  Im advocating for many of these men to be like permanent deacons aka nonsalaried volunteers.

Pretty sure that didnt happen that way. But as a general part of Catholic belief only humans can truly suffer as true suffering requires a being with a rational soul. Suffering is a metaphysical thing an idea you are treating it here as some sort of strictly physical fact. This isnt the way we believe suffering exists. gt Am I missing something?Well you are assuming the past is a constant and cant be changed and are constraining all change to tgtfall. This is not an assumption you get to make when dealing with causes from outside spacetime. Reality itself could have been radically altered all the way back to t. And I dont rule out that possibility.There are other less radical possibilities too. But since that one cant be ruled out its usually a show stopper for further discussion. My general opinion and its just my opinion is something was removed from reality almost in entirety and that removal corresponds to the exile. But anyway the faith of the Church is that suffering and death were brought to metaphysical being by the choice that caused the fall. Thats the faith of the Church.

I was a pretty good kid but I still ended up seeing movies like Dogma and Stigmata.Fourth by forbidding your teens to watch this show in particular youre calling attention to it and essentially guaranteeing that theyll find a way to see it without your knowledge.

Most of them are intelligent enough to be able to separate fiction from reality when watching shows.I dont have a teen but heres what Id do  Dont pay any particular attention to this show.  Chances are itll get canceled soon enough. If Im wrong and it does become popular and I suspect my teen has been watching or is especially interested in the show Id start watching it conspicuously myself and invite them to join me.

4216265,0,t1_cs0tuo2,Well in the US its a combination of predominance of Protestant theology on the cultural landscape it makes for a sexier story than good old Amillenialism and poor catechesis although I suppose thats true in many places.In my own life the first person actually interested in teaching me about the End Times was a nice little Evangelical girl I was dating in high school who pushed this idea. I didnt find out a Catholic response to it until long after we broke up and I was in college.Like in my story Id wager most Catholics simply dont know the Catholic position and why it makes sense because theyre not taught and most dont have the curiosity to seek it out. Even otherwise pious Catholics might not be that interested because theres not immediate impact on their lives. So into that vacuum Millenialism creeps in.

Labels like homosexual heterosexual bisexual and the whole gamut of new ones people use today stem from th century psychology and thought. Although popular now it isnt the only way one can view themselves nor does it mesh particularly well with the orthodox little o christian understanding of sexuality. This is because to use there is no vast spectrum of sexuality. Only that which Good and righteous in the eyes of God and the church and those which are deemed unhealthy and are to be avoided. This puts the focus on marriage procreation and doesnt pigeonhole people which makes for  disproportionate attention on some sexual sins and is lenient on the other. There are just as many ways to be sinful with hetrosexual desires as there are with homosexual ones.We all deal with them to varying degrees be it hetrosexual desires homosexual desires polyamourous desires or abnormal and misguided sexual fixations also known as fetishes.

4387666,0,t1_csk7ynw,Heres something else youve taken completely out of context through an incredibly shallow understanding of a subject primarily through the lens of popculture garbage nonsense!Judging is in fact a Biblical concept though you would be correct on Christians sometimes judging out of spite instead of love though they generally judge all peoples to a Christian standard where this is unbliblcal. The verse youre specifically referencing is Matthew gtDo not judge so that you will not be judged.However youre forgetting the latter part of the same statement by ChristgtDo not judge so that you will not be judged. For in the way you judge you will be judged and by your standard of measure it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the speck that is in your brothers eye but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?  Or how can you say to your brother Let me take the speck out of your eye and behold the log is in your own eye? You hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brothers eye.Broken down Christ is not telling us that we can never judge another persons actions as we do not judge people God does that but we are called to judge another Christians  and persons in society in general  actions hate the sin not the sinner. Rather He was making a statement to live a righteous life so that any judgement or pronouncement would not be made in a rash fashion and that the efforts would not be wasted in trying to correct another Christian. Taking that first line you could make the statement that a person could simply escape final judgement by never judging another  this is of course not true everyone is judged once by God so this cannot be the proper understanding. Instead people that point to this passage and claim hypocrites! are correct here  hypocritical judgement is not effective you lose your witness at that moment. Christ instead tells us how to do it effectively  first taking the log out of our own eye so that we can then clearly see the speck in our brothers. Do not forget that there are other instances in Scripture where Christ actively calls us to judgeJohn gtDo not judge according to appearance but judge with righteous judgment.Matthew gtIf your brother sins go and show him his fault in private if he listens to you you have won your brother. But if he does not listen to you take one or two more with you so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every fact may be confirmed. If he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.These are among more  Corinthians  and  Corinthians  come to mind. There is a big difference between judging someones behavior and judging the state of someones soul. Far too often Christians get this confused and the effects are more than detrimental. That is reserved only for God. Pauls words in Romans  was cajoling those believers in that congregation to stop harassing others in the same congregation out of spite. However that statement taken in context with the whole of Romans  tells us why Paul addressed the issue as he did  they were essentially judging nonessential behaviors that were holdovers of the converts in the congregation from Judaism that were not necessarily harmful to the faith or to the Church and leaving each member to his own conscience wherein he had freedom in belief.What makes me qualified to make such a judgement? Im another Catholic who knows Catholic doctrine dogma and teaching. Im telling you that you are in error and are not in good standing with the Church that you openly oppose Catholic teaching and if you really want that confirmation? Go ask your Priest about your prosame sex union stance especially as it relates to the Church. Immediately after telling him this you should also ask if you should take communion or go to confession beforehand see what he says. Why shouldnt I take communion again? Hurting your feelings? Sorry telling you youre wrong isnt a sin. gtThen there you go. Your original idea of separating church and state is wrong by your own indirect admission. Gay marriage is protected under the Constitution. If you dont like that I suggest moving to another country.Hey abortion is legal as well Im sure youre fine with that too because society says it is so right? Also no still wrong. So far you havent shown anything but an inchdeep level understanding of anything youve tried to bring up here. You really need to do some serious studying about your faith what separation of Church and state is what it means why it was actually written into the Constitution and then form an opinion. This is the last reply youll get from me as youre clearly set in your ways and no amount of refutation will convince you otherwise. ,Catholicism,csk8626,1,t5_2qi4f

4400533,0,t1_csl53mb,Also with regards to point two if you want to be scientific one could also argue life requires that the organism can maintain homeostasis that is they can live by themselves. However early zygotes cannot it doesnt have a cardiovascular system when its only forming the  germ layers so thats why Roe defined viable as being potentially able to live outside the mothers womb albeit with artificial aid. This is also why biologists do not consider viruses to be alive because they have to hijack host cells to propagate. Note however that most prochoice people are uncomfortable with this definition because by  weeks the nervous system is developing and presumably the fetus might be dreaming. But it doesnt matter whether it is or is not alive because the debate isnt about is it alive but whether it is morally permissible to kill a fetus. For most humans we say we cannot kill them because we believe that all humans beings have inalienable rights life liberty and pursuing happiness and youd be hardpressed to find someone who is okay with killing a human being except in special circumstance like war selfdefense or capital punishment. In contrast pigs do not have these rights so you can slaughtereat them. So in the case about the fetus when is it a human beingwhen does it gain those inalienable rights? As you have heard there are  commonly used definition  months when it gains the full complement of chromosomes?  months when the nervous system is finally rather well developed? Or what America currently accepts as the legal definition at  months a fetus gains those rights because if taken out of the mother they can live on their own with some artificial aid. Choosing which milestone is arbitrary but you are very wrong to argue that people are not being scientific because all of these milestones are grounded in a logical basis. For instance personally I dont support abortion period except in really extenuating circumstances. However I am sympathetic to those on the other side whose arguments I tried to lay out. I dont think theyre crazy and if they want to believe that its fine with me but personally thats not a moral road I like to take.,Catholicism,csloakb,2,t5_2qi4f

A couple with diagnosed infertility is still capable of living out their vows in a manner consistent with church teaching. Youre right that homosexuality is not a sin just as most other physical desires are not a sin in and of themselves. But lets be absolutely clear  homosexual acts are certainly a sin. And to celebrate a homosexual union as marriage is to celebrate that sin. Its not a matter of which is more wrong. Sodomy is sodomy. Sodomy is sin. With a homosexual union there is no possibility for anything other than a celibate relationship to be within the bounds of the church. That is very clear. Its also in line with church teaching that other physical expressions of romantic feelings short of a sexual act are similarly disordered as they are essentially going down a dead end street leading only to temptation and sin.,Catholicism,cso5r9r,-2,t5_2qi4f

At this point it should be a priority because so many people me included get the vast majority of information from the internet.The parish I attend has a high quality website.  Even so it sometimes isnt perfectly updated.The solution really depends on the parish and the diocese.  I think there is something to be said for having a diocese wide template  something professionally created.  Then individual parishes can fill in their details.  At the very least there should be a diocese wide style sheet of what is required to be on the site Mass times contact info etc.I am actually part of the social media team for a parish.  I have the responsibility for maintaining the instagram account.  Other people handle twitter  facebook and the young adult twitterfacebook accounts.  Then we all loosely coordinate with the person responsible for the website.  This way nobody is individually responsible for everything which really could be a full time job.I think the best way to share expertise across parishes would be to perhaps have round table meetings so that volunteers can share tips and tricks and suggestions of what does and does not work.  I know that a nearby parish has an instagram account that kind of makes me wince.  Its fine but could be so much better.

4605682,0,t3_3e318z,Its a weak argument. The Bible has two parts. Old Testament and New. Now for the traditional Hebrew sections of the OT they are extremely old. And thanks to the absolute rigor the Jews used in copying sacred texts there is no expected error. The Greek sections of the OT come from the Septuagint. Good copies existed at the time the Cannon of the Vulgate was formed. It is of note though that Jerome only used Greek when Hebrew originals were unavailable. As far as the New Testament there arent any originals because Jesus did not write he taught and charged others to teach. Only at the end of the Apostolic Age was it seen as a priority to write down the oral traditions of the Apostles. The official originals were in Greek the copies held by the See of Rome to be used to create the Vulgate. The Christian Cannon based on existing writings was not finalized until the s.For this criticism to stick one would have to conclude it was Gods intent to give us a Book instead of a Church. This goes against every contemporary account of Christ. It might be an effective comment against say Sola Scriptura if you are unfortunate enough to believe that. But against critical study of Christ and his ministry no way. One would have to discard Christ and the NT in its entirety in order to get back to The Book being the way without necessitating a lot of cognitive dissonance about Christs ministry. Once you do that the Koran doesnt stand out as a better preserved text than the Hebrew OT and logically would be very erroneous as it calls out to an original Gospel that has in the scholarly sense is never thought to have existed. Historically speaking the Gospels show influence from multiple sources none of which standing alone could be considered a true and complete original Gospel that is referenced in the Koran. So it boils down to the only way to believe the criticism is if you have unconditional faith it its source. ,Catholicism,ctb4qwd,8,t5_2qi4f

First the idea of Protestantism cannot really be a thing like Catholicism or Judaism or Orthodoxy.  Motives to leave the Church are too varied.  Some Northern European princes wanted to grab the Churchs land and property then couched their argument in Lutheran theology.  Some people wanted to live like libertines.  Some had legitimate grievances.My own denomination began as the National Church of Scotland.  Our founding documents rant against the Church of England and Catholic Church with almost equal bile.  The need for reform and not be under English tyranny was real.  The Catholic Church has cleaned up by orders of magnitude since then theologically politically etc.In my own life considering those I have known who are not religious yet were raised in the Church either Catholic or Protestant I see no trend that indicates one or the other leads more to atheism.OTOH your point  I have trouble refuting.  Lots of big box churches exist because of .  OTOH the Mormons make their members behave to a high standard take married life seriously go to college at a very high rate etc.  It is sharply at odds with orthodox belief and makes its people work harder and avoid fun stuff yet it is enormous.I regret I cannot give a better answer with much fewer words but I hope St. Thomas Aquinas can intervene with some scholar goofing off on Reddit who can help. ,Catholicism,ctiiyjy,-1,t5_2qi4f

I sort of get it but I would appreciate a full explanationJesus was literally God incarnate in a human being. This has many important implications. It meant that God could participate in human life and human suffering. It meant God would have the chance to give his message of exactly who he was and what he wanted out of humanity. Ultimately it meant that he would die be raised and a new convenant agreement would be established between man and God.Ancient people almost universally believed in the concept of sacrifice to appease Gods. While we see this as silly they recognized a very important truth  that justice is real. Justice means each getting their just deserts deserved punishment or credit. To receive whether it is good weather for harvest good health safety from invaders justice must be done  and you must give. The ancients believed offering Gods animals and unfortunately even people balanced the scales of justice in their favor. They took a crucial truth about reality and came to the wrong conclusion but it was because they lacked knowledge of divine revelation.This scale of justice is a real thing so while the ancients may have been misguided that God wants dead animalspeople they were right that the scales must be balanced. Jesus came to balance the scale on all of our behalf. His death justified balanced the scale of human sin and allowed for redemption and eternal life metaphorically that is why he didnt just die  he also literally was raised from the dead. His death instituted the apostolic church which would honor his ultimate sacrifice and new convenant with all humans. Now all we need to do is cooperate with Gods law through natural theologylaw and the guidance of the apostolic church and eternal life is ours.,Catholicism,ctruy45,1,t5_2qi4f

This past Sunday at mass I was surprised to hear that one of Gods greatest servants Elijah had the same feeling!gtElijah went a days journey into the desert  until he came to a broom tree and sat beneath it.  He prayed for death saying  This is enough O LORD!  Take my life for I am no better than my fathers.  He lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree  but then an angel touched him and ordered him to get up and eat.  Elijah looked and there at his head was a hearth cake  and a jug of water.  After he ate and drank he lay down again  but the angel of the LORD came back a second time  touched him and ordered  Get up and eat else the journey will be too long for you!  He got up ate and drank  then strengthened by that food  he walked forty days and forty nights to the mountain of God Horeb.God didnt argue with Elijah and he doesnt argue with us. He gave Elijah food for his journey and Christ has given us his flesh and blood as food for ours. If you wonder why this life is miserable it is because this life cant satisfy us. We will never find satisfaction anywhere but in God because we were made to share in his joy.When you look at the cross it is ok to reflect on how awful our sins are. But you must remember that Christ endured all of that to rescue us. In other words when you are tempted to dislike yourself think about how much God loves you. How we think about God has a lot to do with how we see ourselves. Do you think God is looking down on you silently judging you keeping a list of all of your flaws and mistakes?

Now I understand where it comes from. But he has a tendency to appoint people as far from curial politics as possiblewhich includes people who lets face it are just this side of heresy. Himself I dont fear. But he is too keen to sidestep the Curia which lets in forces that the Curia was in place to moderate in the first place.

4978027,0,t3_3j2qa2,gt I delved into the YouTube commentsTheres your problem right there.But seriously the other problem is that the Bible records events that were common knowledge held by a literate community without interruption from the time of the generation that experienced them.For example lets say that there is no written or other historical or archaeological record of what happened on . People who were there lived through it. Their friends and families learned about it from them. A thousand years later the events will still be common knowledge to the communities descended from them. Sure there will be variations and legends and incorrect memories and so on but Biblical communities wrote them down and in many cases memorized the written accounts plus on top of that people who remembered timelines or other details of events correctly could correct people with mixedup memories.A second bigger problem is How do you hoodwink an entire community into believing that a nonexistent event took place if it is the sort of event that would have become common knowledge if it did happen?For example lets say  never happened. How would you convince the people of Manhattan that several generations ago two planes flew into two tall buildings killing over three thousand people and reducing the neighborhood to a pile of rubble? People would say things like My family has lived here in Manhattan for generations and we never heard our parents or grandparents mention it so what is your reason for saying it happened? Because something of that magnitude would have immediately become a traditional story to be passed down to your children yet nobody including all of my friends all of my neighbors nobody has heard anything about it and some of their families have been police and firefighters going back for generations.If you want to play the archaeology card and say that  can be proven or disproven based on debris found buried in the area then take a counterexample that leaves behind zero archaeological evidence like the aurora of  January .

China is not that place and so one escaping religious persecution would probably not seek refuge in China where they are not free to practice their religion.Most of the West is united in holding those ideals liberty justice equality opportunity.  Those ideals are not shared in or at the very least not imbedded in the political DNA of large swathes of the rest of the world.To answer why that is the case is to provide a survey of world history.But a couple other obvious answers are  the process for obtaining legal entry into a country or political asylum in a country varies the job opportunities vary the average standard of living varies.The United States became great IMO because of its formerly laissez faire immigration policy.

Theologically of course hes wrong if he supports gay marriage I havent seen a source for this though I dont doubt it necessarily. And he may be wrong on a number of other doctrinal issues as well. But not being a perfect Catholic is probably a good sign that he is a real Catholic. None of us are perfect and the worst among us are the pharisaical bunch who spit venom in his direction overlooking his virtue and drowning in the sheer irony of such a critique. He is not a man who has openly dissented from the doctrines of the Church nor is he a man who actively seeks to lead people away from Magisterial teaching. He certainly does seem to believe some things that are heterodox but he also seems to hold these things in good conscious and with moral and intellectual consistency.Colbert is not the posterchild for orthodoxy but he hasnt claimed to be and I think knows that about himself.

When you believe there is an afterlife and you believe souls are a thing that all influences how you look at what is wrong and right. If I believe life begins at conception and that those babies have souls already I would be less likely to abort them. If I however believe they are just fetuses and are nothing but things I can choose to have or not then Id be more likely to abort them.

Peer influence is also much more subtle than the typical peer pressure memes. Kids exist in a complex social hierarchy and their place within that hierarchy affects their decisions and behaviour. There is only so much a parent can do and a childs success or failure is at best only partly under the parents control. Peers are a huge factor. ,Catholicism,cv1ecuw,3,t5_2qi4f

I highly recommend to you that you read The Crucified Rabbi by Dr. Taylor Marshall in this time of discernment. I think a voice phone call is in order. If I were her dad I would be duly impressed. Here are the things I would be concerned about and that you might address in the conversation Will you assent to the Catholic teaching on marriage? That is joining together for life for the procreation and education of children and mutual help for each spouse.  Will you assent to your children being baptized Catholic? Raised Catholic? Will you be a spiritual leader to your family even though you dont share their faith? Will you be the one getting your kids up and making Mass attendance mandatory?BTW those are questions Im going to ask my daughters suitors even if they tell me theyre Catholic.Give him a call.

Its never permissible for an adult to claim their ignorance is the fault of others in this day and age. If you are in your s and dont know enough about your faith to evangelize then its your responsiblity to fix that. But what Id like to get at in catechesis responding to an argument isnt about memorizing the argument. Its about understanding the principals of the argument. For instance on my list items    are elements based in Natural Law as a foundational principal behind the arguments. A Catecumen was probably never taught how Natural Law relates to the nature of God as creater and willed order to creation therefore has no real understanding of the responses to those issues. Therefore the response does become a drill of memorization of facts without depth. Instead of a demonstration of thoughtful intellect in applying a reasoned faith in a creator to the issues. We dont teach the foundational basics of theology and philosophy At least we havent for a long time we teach facts about the faith. We teach to the lowest level of understanding in the class and turn out Catholics whom dont even know how much bigger their faith is than what theyve been taught.  Furthermore as a communal whole we tolerate this as the norm. Low expectations of the lay faithful like we were still living in the middle ages. If anything thats why I love Father Bishop Barron.

God created man entirely holy and sinless. Our sinful condition is not the result of Gods creative work but is a historical consequence of our abuse of free will. To say that God should have created us for the most part holy and not sinful fails to do justice to the true freedom and consequences of free will.Free will means that even though our first parents were entirely sinless and enjoyed the life of original grace they were still capable of choosing to be otherwise and forfeiting of the life of graceand thats just what they did. We their offspring are conceived and born bereft of this life spiritually dead in original sin. Even when we are spiritually reborn in baptism we remain affected by concupiscence or tendencies toward sin as a result of having been conceived in original sin.

That draws a big contrast with Pope Francis who sees a world where radical islam is killing Christians everywhere yet hes focused as much or more on issues like the environment and economics than on the persecution of those Christians. I dont believe JP was talking about those things at the height of the conflict in the soviet union and poland.

So in that sense it seems to be a hotbutton issue for them and I suppose it is for me too.. Personally I dont find prolife or prochoice to be useful categories only in that they often close down the messiness of ethical life. For example my father was an OB and would often say hes prolife until things get more complicated. A situation he cited in his own practice was a time when a mother of several children at home would either lose her life or the child would lose its life in which case there is no ultimately good ethical outcomesomeone will lose a life and that loss will be a tragic sacrifice.

5233739,0,t3_3mofns,Pascal once gave advice to a man struggling with his faith. He told him to act as the Christians do go to Mass use holy water pray as they do etc. In time he said belief will come. Theologically this is the concept of actual grace. Even when we have doubts or are in sin God helps us through created things. His grace reaches us through the concrete physical things we do. Eventually this reception of actual grace leads to reception of sanctifying grace or true friendship with God. Like all friendships it needs to grow over time. In our human friendships we might have had very little interest in the other person at the beginning. But through concrete physical experiences the relationship deepens. The first step is the least comfortable but with each subsequent step the bond strengthens.Faith in Our Lord is exactly that faith. It is supernatural not something you can just learn over night or acquire through diligence. It is a gift freely given by God. The only way one acquires a supernatural gift is through grace and there are many opportunities for this. All the humanitarian efforts that attract you to the Church are good but are also occasions of grace. So my advice is similar to Pascals stay close to those human works but also try some spiritual exercises even if you dont believe. Belief will come in time.,Catholicism,cvgutjw,6,t5_2qi4f

5258486,0,t3_3n0vnq,To be brief no.To be more thorough discernment of Gods will should never be reliant on solely exterior events. Even if many other people and signs suggest you get married saying youre suited for it thats not the deciding factor for discernment. Of course it can play a role many a seminarian or exseminarian has a story of signs pointing to one vocation or another. But their actual decision came from a deeper source the rest were more like assurances.At heart your discernment should be based on where you might give yourself most wholly to God for that is where He calls you. This is done by many methods prayer draws you closer to God helping you see His Will and how you are called to love in your own particular vocational way intellectual study can help determine your gifts and strengths thus giving you a better indication of both where your talent lies and what you desire to do talking with priests and those who know you can give more clarity on how youve impacted them and how you might go on to impact others etc.Things like dreams and strange coincidences may be signs from God but in the end God does not want you to depend on them. As St. John of the Cross teaches your discernment and choices should not be based on an exterior revelation like a dream. Even an apparition by an angel can be false though thats a whole different topic! so in the end your discernment must be born of much conversation with God and much thought and prayer.,Catholicism,cvju3f0,5,t5_2qi4f

5263187,0,t1_cvkf3o8,I totally agree with you and would only add that I think mockery in all its forms including sarcasm and satire as you say originates in a very unCatholic  unChristian attitude of attacking the sinner.It is often said correctly that we are called to love and have compassion for the sinner just as we all have sinned and may yet be tempted again but hate and correct the sin.  It is clearly neither compassionate nor charitable to attack the sinner and it threatens our own salvation as the rests on the mercy of God which we are meant to reflect.I too struggle with not throwing harsh mocking words about or thinking ill of people for that matter especially when they have thrown some my way first.  However that is no excuse and I know I need to take an example from Jesus and the saints that have followed Him and turn the other cheek.  If I do respond it should be in the spirit of charity with an aim at explaining Truth as objectively as possible and not to make me feel better than the other in some way.,Catholicism,cvkfi6b,5,t5_2qi4f

5298841,0,t3_3nkuon,Awesome questions! Welcome to RCIAI really loved my time there just last year in fact. These are perfect questions for your RCIA instructor but lets give it a shot. This isnt precisely how most people in the Church will phrase it but the easiest way to understand why incest is a sin is that it conflates two DISTINCT types of love familial and romantic. Because as Catholics to love is our calling its very important that we keep all the different types of love distinct and therefore clearly defined. Yesfor issues of respect of the human person. Masturbating is not the baseline sin. Lust is and its close to impossible to watch porn and not commit the sin of lust. Thats not at all the justification for masturbation being a sin. Masturbation FOR MEN AND WOMEN is equally a sin because its a perversion of human love. Instead of focusing outwards it focuses on ourselves. Well off the top of my head something inadvisable but not a sin wouldnt incur any guiltyou wouldnt need to confess it.  Still reading no idea what that is  Thats really not it. The argument against homosexuality is primarily that Jesus has defined the sacrament of marriage as involving one man and one woman and we are powerless to change Jesus commands. I think the Church teaches that forgiveness outside of the sacrament of confession is unknowable and hence I have no data to tell you how common it may be. But perfect contrition AND the sacrament of confession work together really nicelydont think of one as the substitute. If possible have perfect contrition even IN the sacrament of confession! Are you repentant? Repentant sorry for your sins actively striving to do better? Then yes God has more or less promised to forgive any repentant person. Hell is eternal suffering totally unmitigated by any good thing whatsoever. Purgatory is essentially a process of purification after your death to prepare you to enter Gods presence. The support is largely in this evident idea that we may love God and have a pure conscience before him but we still have little spots or errors in our souls which lead us to sin. Such things would cause us pain in Gods presence so we are cleaned of them beforehand. Also  Maccabees. Sure you could. But the Hail Mary is a highly scriptural prayer you know. Mary is super important because she was the perfect disciple of Jesus who intercedes for us with a Mothers love. Dont fear Mary learn to love her as Jesus did. Possibly? I assume he could as the Pope is just another Bishop with some special duties. Things like that have happened actually. There was a th century Pope who really wanted to write an encyclical that would have forced some heretical doctrine or other on the Church. He kept trying to write it then he got sick and died. ,Catholicism,cvozl07,4,t5_2qi4f

I would not worry about things such as annulments and contraception right away as those will be addressed during the RCIA process and you can always get more info about it.I write only to caution you with your approach.  I would not view it as a search for a religion that is right for you as if youre shopping for a car or a club to join.  We welcome all to the church and are delighted to see you exploring the faith.  There are no outsiders to the grace of God except those who put themselves outside so it is never an intrusion to have people inquiring.  While many denominations exist and its tempting to proceed in checking off the boxes for the beliefs you share with them Catholicism demands more as the one church founded by Christ himself.  It is not merely a belief system it is a lifestyle.  Living the Catholic life is no trivial thing and I hope it does not intimidate anyone to know that but its only fair that you be informed.  It requires a fair bit of surrendering of the ego to embrace Catholicism.

5466516,0,t3_3px2j0,This is a deeply nuanced question that Im far from qualified to answer but from what I remember of the time I spent reading books on Aristotelian and Thomist metaphysics the fundamental difference between the two schools of thought when it came to metaphysics related to these things called forms. The form or essence of something is basically what makes it that particular kind of thing  its shape features etc. So the form of a triangle would be a geometrical shape with three sides and interior angles adding to  degrees the form of a dog would be that of a furry quadruped with a handful of other distinctively doggy qualities etc.Now Plato postulated forms first in order to explain why some things are like other things. It sounds stupid and simple but its much deeper than that. If a draw a triangle on a piece of paper and on a whiteboard it is a commonsense statement that they are both triangles. But what does it mean for something to be a triangle? For it to possess the properties delineated above? Then what holds these properties together? Is the word triangle just a convenient holder to refer to a bunch of properties that interact with each other in an interesting way? Or does it refer to an actual thing that exists in some sense just not in the same way as actual triangles exist?Platos answer was that these sorts of things existed in what he called the World of Forms. No not the HR office  basically the plane of existence on which all the forms exist. The forms are perfect in a way material objects cannot be  my lousy triangles will definitely not have exactly equal sides for example and probably have slightly bulging sides so that the angles dont add up to  degrees. Not to mention that any particular existing triangle has properties such as size angles lengths colour thickness but that these properties are not the universal properties of triangles and hence cannot exist as part of the form. So its clear that the forms cannot exist in their pure form here. So Plato simply proposed a different level of existence for them which he called the World of Forms and said that all material objects participate in their respective forms in the World of Forms. I cant quite remember how he explained it or if he did at all but thats essentially Platonic Metaphysics .Aristotle Platos student thought he was full of it. He gave lots of objections to the existence of a World of Forms but still wanted to  explain why some things were like other things. So he proposed instead that the forms existed in this world and in fact that all physical objects were compounds of matter and form. So instead of my two triangles both participating in the same transcendental form of a triangle existing in the World of Forms Aristotle would say that they are both objects that contain the same form. And thats Aristotelian Metaphysics .Now this is a vast oversimplification but itll do for our purposes. This distinction in addition to being immortalised in the Philosophy fresco in the Apostolic Palace central figures Plato on left pointing up to indicate that the forms are in the transcendent World of Forms while Aristotles palm faces down indicating that the forms exist here in physical reality is responsible for a lot of their divergent conclusions. Plato for example believed that to know something was to know its form but since they were in the transcendent and inaccessible World of Forms it had to be the case that our souls existed in the World of Forms before our birth and the Forms imprinted themselves on our minds which is how it was possible for us to have knowledge of them. Knowledge therefore for Plato was innate though it still needed to be unlocked by prompting which is why we arent born geniuses. Aristotle on the other hand while sharing Platos belief that knowledge of something was knowledge of its form believed that the forms existed in the world so he proposed that we learn about forms by perceiving things through our senses through experiencing and perceiving an object and then using your intellect to try and tease out its essential qualities and in so doing come to knowledge of its form. This may also explains why Aristotle put so much effort into studying the natural world  he was simply trying to get acquainted with all the different forms.Now once again this is a massive oversimplification intended to illustrate the fundamental point of divergence between Aristotle and Plato. If you really needwant to you should do your own due diligence learn about both and compare them yourself or at the very least find a professional to do the comparing for you I learnt everything I know about this topic from the internet and a book or two for heavens sake P. You can start with Wikipedia or poke around in your university library  Im sure therell be some introductory texts to the philosophy of Plato or Aristotle or both. As for myself I learnt most of what I know about these things from Edward Feser so you may want to check it out.As for the impacts of both upon Church doctrine while my knowledge in this area is much more deep than broad I know that Aquinas was an Aristotelian. True Aristotle came up with some wacky conclusions as uCamoJacket points out but Aquinas ironed them all out into a massive coherent philosophical system. I think he borrowed some ideasinsights from the NeoPlatonists but not being overly familiar with them I cant quite say which. But whatever the case uCamoJacket is wrong about the reason for Aristotelianism going out of favour  it definitely wasnt incompatibility with Christianity. Nobody adhered to pure Aristotelianism at that point everyone knew about Aquinas Catholicised Aristotelianism which was about as orthodox as one could get.,Catholicism,cwaedib,1,t5_2qi4f

In the case of the abusive husband he is the one trying to deceive others for his own benefit by choosing words that do not reflect his true intentions he asks for her in the most innocent manner while he wants to abuse her further while the man who opens the door is trying to avoid deception by giving an answer that takes into account the true intention behind the words of the agressor.

5583763,0,t3_3rlvrv,. Not really see .. Going to confession first is the right way to go.. Thats right the Church does not recognize your marriage. The only way to get recognized is to marry in the Church which works even if your wife is not a Catholic though that way you would have to raise your Son catholic which is why  doesnt work. CCC  EDIT I meant of course Can  does it work with an edit? EDIT it seems it doesnt  gtCan.   Without express permission of the competent authority a marriage is prohibited between two baptized persons of whom one is baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it after baptism and has not defected from it by a formal act and the other of whom is enrolled in a Church or ecclesial community not in full communion with the Catholic Church.gtCan.   The local ordinary can grant a permission of this kind if there is a just and reasonable cause. He is not to grant it unless the following conditions have been fulfilled   the Catholic party is to declare that he or she is prepared to remove dangers of defecting from the faith and is to make a sincere promise to do all in his or her power so that all offspring are baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church   the other party is to be informed at an appropriate time about the promises which the Catholic party is to make in such a way that it is certain that he or she is truly aware of the promise and obligation of the Catholic party   both parties are to be instructed about the purposes and essential properties of marriage which neither of the contracting parties is to exclude.gtCan.   It is for the conference of bishops to establish the method in which these declarations and promises which are always required must be made and to define the manner in which they are to be established in the external forum and the nonCatholic party informed about them.,Catholicism,cwp7ua2,3,t5_2qi4f

5587745,0,t3_3rkhyp,It is a good question bc most Catholics and many protestants misunderstand this point.  Unlike what many think it is not all you have to do is have faith and you will be saved as if it is dependent upon you.  Instead of being something you do even though it may seem to be this way on a human level initially it is something God alone does  He gives you faith.This emphasis on Gods work instead of humans work is best supported by Romans  ff And not only this but there was Rebekah also when she had conceived twins by one man our father Isaac  for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad so that Gods purpose according to His choice would stand not because of works but because of Him who calls  it was said to her The older will serve the younger.  Just as it is written Jacob I loved but Esau I hated. What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God is there? May it never be!  For He says to Moses I will have mercy on whom I have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.  So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs but on God who has mercy.  For the Scripture says to Pharaoh For this very purpose I raised you up to demonstrate My power in you and that My name might be proclaimed throughout the whole earth.  So then He has mercy on whom He desires and He hardens whom He desires. You will say to me then Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?  On the contrary who are you O man who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder Why did you make me like this will it?  Or does not the potter have a right over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?  What if God although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?  And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy which He prepared beforehand for glorymy emphasis added.I hope this helps.

5589271,0,t1_cwpvjz5,gt This is not the Catholic teaching. No marriage can ever be ended by mere civil law. To attempt it or to support the legality of such attempts is to mock Gods law.Im not saying that legal divorce is ending a marriage. Im saying the legal structures that the laws call marriage may need to be severed to prevent abuse. The couple is still married both before the Church and God but an abusive spouse should not be able to have access to the abused spouses money or be able to make decisions for an incapacitated person they have been abusing. Civil divorce is the only way to protect some people at least in the US.EDIT IANAL my understanding was incorrect.gt It shouldnt remain the only possible way. That isnt a bad position to take but as it is now civil divorce is an unfortunate necessity.I would be curious to hear any suggestions to fix that.

Most if not all undercover officers are subject to drug testing. Their testimony would not be reliable and would likely be inadmissible in court if they tested positive probably under the same type of logic that you cant operate a motor vehicle while under the influence  it inhibits your ability to focus and alters your state of mind.Now if an officer were to be compelled to use under penalty of death for not using I highly doubt they would be charged with a criminal offence.Undercover officers usually fake using or come up with some kind of excuse as to why they cant use at that moment.

5736626,0,t1_cx83xup,well as to the questions of why Muslims are moving to the West I wouldnt say theyre fleeing havoc of Western Imperialism or any of that propaganda.  I think theyre like most people in that the average person prefers to live in a place where they can live work and have a family without the fear of being blown up or killed by a passing militia.  As to the obvious question of why they dont all go to Muslim countries well the options for a lot of them arent super good.  Jordans native population is currently outnumbered by Palestinian refugees and their economy isnt the strongest Saudi Arabia already has high unemployment Turkey well Turkey is probably the strongest but their priorities are currently focused on Kurds with ISIS being an afterthought so theyre not necessarily the friendliest towards refugees. To a refugee looking for a new home and place to find a job Europe and North America seem more appealing in the same way that the U.S. got a flood of immigrants during different times in its history.  Really it makes more sense to try to distribute refugees over several countries and states instead of saying well Eastern Europe your economy isnt the strongest but try to absorb all these peopleAnd what is my evidence on Muslim countries.  Well in the long term its hard to tell what the trend is but you have Egypt Tunisia and Morocco all relatively stable countries that are typically moderate Islamic mixed with secular.  In fact most Muslim countries that are not overrun in civil wars are fairly good at mixing secular rights with their religious beliefs.  Do they have a bias towards Islam in a lot of their laws yes but on the general principal as long as their laws dont violate the laws of non Muslims I cant begrudge the principal of having a countrys laws influenced by religion.  As for the most invasive and oppressive of theocratic Muslim states like Saudi Arabia and Iran things are bad there yes.  Very bad however the trend is that things will likely change slowly but they will change.  Young Iranians find ways around repressive theocratic policies and seem to give hope that the old generation of theocratcs will slowly lose power.  As for Saudi Arabia their strict system is starting to show cracks and once the pluthera of elderly princes running the place give way to younger generations I suspect that theyll be forced to change.  Generally speaking the average Muslim doesnt want the Taliban or ISIS or Wahabbi Sharia Law implemented and those who live under it tend to hate that system and only accept it because the guys running the show have guns.  Im not all that concerned because the people who actually want to implement such strict systems they go off and die trying to implement it so that problem resolves itself and most of the people fleeing have kind of had a bad experience with it and arent likely to say  you know what I miss being flogged for listening to CDs those were the daysWe live in countries where people have the right to choose their religion.  Id be happy to encourage Muslims to Catholicism and I rejoice at the news of anyone brought to the full truth in Christs Church but Im also not a fan of people saying that a countrys government should dictate what religion its citizens follow be it Catholic Protestant Muslim or Hindu because that kind of system tends to end badly for everyone.  And just in general I dont really see a direct line of super secular Europe to Islam they just dont line up very well.  Like France banning religious garb in public or Switzerland banning Minarets or with social policies that just dont jell too well with conservative Muslims.  And the alternative is you have a large population of refugees with nowhere to go with resentment looking for someone to blame for their problems.  then a friendly recruiter for whatever terrorist organization comes along and says hey your life is miserable why dont you join us and fight these people who are clearly to blame as opposed to having people come over and over time integrating into society sure there are problems and sure it takes a long time but its better than the first option.  ,Catholicism,cx86nqq,0,t5_2qi4f

The Church doesnt say how many kids you ought to have  all it says is that you should try to have as many kids as you can reasonably expect to support which is pretty vague and up to your personal discretion. So long as you arent trying limit the number of kids you have so you can support a more luxurious lifestyle youll be fine. The Church just asks that you always remain open to any life that God entrusts to you and your husband. If you dont want to talk about stuff like that to others you are perfectly within your rights to stop talking about it  so long as you are using moral methods of family planning it is no ones business but yours your husbands and Gods.. Theres also nothing inherently wrong about not wanting to be a stayathome mom. Now  and this is my personal opinion  I think that having a parent at home is better for children but there are lots of circumstances that can affect whether or not a family can afford to have a parent at home.. Kindly correct them. Take into consideration the context though. Some people speak out of completely innocent ignorance and these are the ones who are easier to address.

Im not sure it misses the point though.  I think it makes a more important point.  If the law is a relic from a prepermanent diaconate Church nobody in a position of authority wants to let the law be used to subjugate the permanent diaconate in a manner it was not intended.  So the point that technically the letter of the law applies to the permanent diaconate isnt overlooked its just ignored because once you allow it to constitute the premise of the discussion youve just elevated the canon from the position of servant to master.Just like the episode from the synoptic Gospels where the Apostles are picking heads of wheat.

Clothing communicates and to discuss clothing without the context of the whole bodyoutfit would be like discussing individual phonemes instead of whole words. So I apologize for mispeaking before. Of course given my example of the African cultures which do not sexualize bare breasts it should have been implicit in my post. gt For example a bikini might be recognized as a swimwear article of clothing but the uncovered skin that goes along with it is decidedly not so innocent.Well its the last bit thats controversial. Among cultures and subcultures that fetishize bellies that may be the case. And clothing can recontextualize skin so this might be immodest you could reasonably say that many western men could conceivably be tempted by lustbut youd give most dudes who reacted to this with TURN IT OFF THE LUST IS BURNING a bit of a sideeye And most men would find something like this elegant regardless of the shocking appearence of a bit of tummy. And most men would classify this as not sexyimmodestlustinducing but this which bares less flesh as most definitely lustinducing and if you tailored and smacked on the former onto the person modelling the latter it would still be far more modest. And to return to bikinis and pull from an old post by uotiac This Would be considered more modest than this nsfw So sure if Western Culture has established The Tummy as something sexual to be covered except when the monogomous sexy times are a goin on the bikini is immodest as even though it is not coded for sex part of the outfit the revelation of the tummy is. gt Society is not a monolith and it does not always clearly do one thing and not another thing.Sure subcultures exist. Im talking about the dominant western and specifically American culture. Clearly one shouldnt wear a bikini to a homeschooling groups pool party.gt Whats really bizarre is your extrapolation of a onesided idea of modesty based on a short vague sentence from the Catechism which is of course only a summary of Catholic doctrine expressed at one particular time rather than synthesizing the insights of moral theologians with it to make clear the connections between scandal and modesty.I mean yes points for sass! Mroww  etc etc. But as to my former point seriously why are postVII Catholics not critical of secular Victorian sexual narratives? And as to yours specifically wrt the insights of moral theologians now Id like some sources. Not angry dads on blogger but historically significant theologians who addressed just how much skin sinful and just how much modest. And edit the catechism isnt vague. Its pretty clear that it finds modesty culturedependent and the entire passage on modesty is much broader than the narrow NAKED FLESH vs BURKA kind of purely fleshfocused discussions you find on here. And edit  John Paul II goes actually much further than the catechism in his discussion of modesty in Love and Responsibility. He finds modesty not just culturedependent but intentiondependent. He specifically holds that nakedness is only immodest when it has as its aim arousal. and edit  He brings up swimwear as well. there is nothing immodest about the use of a bathing costume at a bathing place but to wear it out on the street or while out for a walk is contrary to the dictates of modesty. Which aligns pretty dang nicely with my original post wrt loungewear being immodest in the context of the mass but not while lounging. ,Catholicism,cxhfmc3,1,t5_2qi4f

From a scientific perspective it is already astronomically unlikely that this could happen by chance even once. The odds are something like  in a number bigger than the number of atoms in the universe.

5868302,0,t1_cxouk7k,gtGranted im not sure if that was the people actually being holy or doing so out of fear. For Francisco Franco it was a two for one deal.  He used religion to drum up political support from the Vatican during the SCW  and he used religion to unify Spain postcivil war.  However  in his personal life he was also very religious. He wasnt a theologian by any means though and his knowledge on theological and doctrinal matters was quite poor.  Some tidbits about Francos religious lifeHe went to confession every week.  As a young man Franco would attend mass every day.  Partly due to his devoutness  and partly so he could talk to his future wife every morning.  Even when they were stationed in Morocco and the Canaries  Franco and his wife would attend mass every day.    As dictator of Spain he went to mass every Sunday and on feast days.  Spanish propaganda officials still maintained Franco attended mass daily. His parton saint was Teresa dvila.   When Franco was a young man the mummified remains of Teresas hands were held in safe keeping in a Spanish seminary.  During the SCW communist forces sacked the seminary and stole the hand  and its enclosing.   In the opening stages of the civil war Franco and his troops sacked the city of Mlaga.  When his men were rummaging through the rubble one of Francos soldiers found the hand in a suitcase filled with money and gold.  The suitcase  money  and hand were immediately brought to Franco.  Until the end of the war Franco dragged the hand around Spain with him.   After the war ended he asked the Vatican if he could keep it for the duration of his life  and he built a shrine for it in his home.And minor nitpicking  but Spain after  wasnt fascist.  Its even debatable if Francoist Spain from  could be considered fascist.  ,Catholicism,cxov5qo,2,t5_2qi4f

This is an awful approach to science.

5906646,0,t3_3w70q2,Regarding the PopeCatechism  The Pope Bishop of Rome and Peters successor is the perpetual and visible source and foundation of the unity both of the bishops and of the whole company of the faithful. For the Roman Pontiff by reason of his office as Vicar of Christ and as pastor of the entire Church has full supreme and universal power over the whole Church a power which he can always exercise unhindered.The college or body of bishops has no authority unless united with the Roman Pontiff Peters successor as its head. As such this college has supreme and full authority over the universal Church but this power cannot be exercised without the agreement of the Roman Pontiff.Thus yes the Pope has more power than other bishops of the Church.Regarding IndulgencesCatechism  addresses indulgences including  An indulgence is a remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven which the faithful Christian who is duly disposed gains under certain prescribed conditions through the action of the Church which as the minister of redemption dispenses and applies with authority the treasury of the satisfactions of Christ and the saints.An indulgence is partial or plenary according as it removes either part or all of the temporal punishment due to sin. The faithful can gain indulgences for themselves or apply them to the dead. An indulgence is obtained through the Church who by virtue of the power of binding and loosing granted her by Christ Jesus intervenes in favor of individual Christians and opens for them the treasury of the merits of Christ and the saints to obtain from the Father of mercies the remission of the temporal punishments due for their sins. Thus the Church does not want simply to come to the aid of these Christians but also to spur them to works of devotion penance and charity.Thus indulgences would absolutely still appear to be applicable today.Can we still summon the Catechism bot?,Catholicism,cxtw7l0,11,t5_2qi4f

Well to put things into perspective I was raised BuddhistConfucianTaoist typical ChineseIndonesian family although I was baptized Catholic I used to identify myself more as a BuddhistConfucianTaoist We call it the three religionssanjiao in Chinese so I did partake a lot in Chinese rituals that involves with Dizang Pusa Ksithigarbha Bodhisattva Guanyin Pusa Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva or TaoistChinese gods like Guanyu Dabogong and other form of ancestor worship. My family includes me in the book of family sort of like genealogy at my clan temple and until last year I almost always wrote my name on the prayer book of local Buddhist temple on Tombsweeping festival I didnt do this year anymore because of college. My family and many other Chinese believe that by putting our name at the book of family at clan temple our ancestors could recognize us and protect us and by writing my name on prayer book the monks would pray for me. But even after I identify more with Catholicism and truly embrace Catholicism I didnt and wont even bother trying so desperately to remove my name from the local temple and from prayer book at Buddhist temple just because I want to distance myself far from my former belief.. I mean I dont even believe in it so why would I even bother ? If you dont believe in Catholicism why do you bother so much with your baptism record ? For you its just a stupid ritual involving pouring water on a babys forehead and reciting some weird prayers isnt it ? st communion confirmation does not even mean anything to you as you only see it as a weird tasteless wafer. Its just funny really. Im sorry if I sound hostile but you do sound like you really hate the Catholic Church and think of it as a monstrous organization that only ruins life and should be exterminated from this world.Also thank you for calling off the church as having antisocial behaviors. You do know that Buddhism is not all about flowers and rainbows as well do you ?

Once you feel like you have those three down Ill throw in a few more Talk to God inside and outside of formal prayer. Try to pick up something regular like Every morning Ill say a Rosary or ever evening before bed Ill do an examen. Not to paralyze you and not to say that you cant miss one in unusual circumstances but because when you get in the habit of making time for God prayer becomes easy. And dont forget to talk to him at other times too. I especially recommend while driving. In a car in traffic your sort of basic reaction brain is fully engaged but your higher brain usually isnt. Switch off the radio and talk to God about your day. Find a Catholic friend or two. Honestly I cant tell you how often Ive been fed up with the antiCatholicism in the world disheartened by events in my private life and thus dissuaded from going to some optional Catholic event Only to have a friend talk me into it. Saints travel in pairs. Dont believe me? Read about them! Practically every Saint was formed by others hung out with others worked with others. One Catholic may succumb to the world but two or three almost never will. Get yourself some good Catholic friends! Read a Gospel through. I advise Mark but its pretty much up to you. Mark will only take...I dont know not that much time. its like  pages in my Bible. Set aside an evening and read Mark cover to cover. Why? Many Catholics get all of our scripture from the Mass lectionary. Which is...fine but since we have the gift of literacy and cheap affordable Bibles its not really ideal anymore. I consider a turning point in my faith the day I read through the Gospel of Mark I came away with a completely different impression much more thorough of Jesus. St Pauls advice is true for everyone but perhaps doubly so for conreverts. Have patience in suffering be constant in prayer. Faithfulness and spirituality is not something you learn every night.

This has provided to be yet another Francisbased disaster at least for me to have to deal with for those I am trying to convert and reconvert. My family are not the only ones who i am trying to convert but they are the only ones who have questioned me about this particular event.

They needed that last piece of the puzzle to get what Jesus had been talking about for three years. Just look at their unbelief and lack of understanding even after those years with Him. The crowds who didnt get to spend years with Jesus would have been worse off.So after the Ascension the Apostles were able to go around and teach with authority and teach from what they knew.

It does not harm a Catholic family or child in any way if homosexual couples are given the right to own property in common inherit each others property receive health benefits from their spouses employers and so on. When it comes to children though I am of one mind with the Holy Father Pope Francis. Children have the right to a mother and a father. Any just decision concerning a right to parent children should have its focus the wellbeing of the child not the desires of adults.

6441203,0,t1_czlc6wl,Ive been a KJV reader my entire life was raised Protestant so a few months when the journey to Catholicism started to get more serious I purchased the Baronius Press DouayRheims. Its a good one but even with this new love for Catholicism and all that it is I still havent been able to find My Bible. Ive read a couple of Joseph Ratzinger books that quote from the RSV and RSVCE this is what has mainly gotten me interested in this text. The other approved English texts Ive found things I just cant live with like the genderneutral thing. Ugh. I also read online homilies that quote from the RSVRSVCERSVCE so I think ive narrowed it down to one of those to study along with. While moving out of the Protestant church to head home Ive obviously taken the translation issue seriously. There are of course differences that I was pretty ignorant to. Repent vs do penance for example. This led me to get a little into the Latin and Greek texts and in doing so I found that for the most part all English translations leave me with a little bit of an unsatisfactory taste. In the example above neither works when looking at the original word in my opinion. Even though I will continue to study these older texts I feel a little empty as corny as it sounds not having a goto English text. I dont like the feeling of bouncing about between different English texts so the RSV does seem maybe the most ecumenical although I feel if I went with the RSV without the CE I would be doing myself and the church a disservice corny I know but Im weird about these things. So the English text will be for studying as English is my mother tongue but in regards to pleasurablespiritualprayerful reading Ill be reading from the Vulgate and slowly learning the CEI  Italian. ,Catholicism,czlk5c6,2,t5_2qi4f

I wouldnt think tax exemption could get yanked based on the mere fact that a political candidate speaks at a church so this would probably depend on the content of their speech. Are they speaking on broad matters of policy and morality? Thats probably fine. It also may be fine if the church building is being employed as a forum and no one is speaking on behalf of the church itself regarding a candidate or campaign. Theres a lot of ways the church could probably run afoul of the law but also a lot of ways to carve this so that they would be at least arguably in the clear. In my semiinformed opinion anyway. Someone better versed in nonprofit law and surrounding case law could provide better speculation.Ive heard of churches being threatened with revocation over borderline or clearly over the line speech before but cant recall any specific examples of it happening.

6607748,0,t1_d02qrdf,I dont understand these eitheror dichotomies you are forming. gtban marriage I think perhaps you should take a trip through the epistles of Saint Paul in scripture. He lays it all out the later saints are just working from his explanation of the theology. Paul allows people to marry if they cannot be chaste any other way. So does Jerome. So would Aquinas. But as to the question Which is better to marry or to be a holy virgin? Paul answers that in a straightforward manner. Virginity is the way.Aquinas deals with your question hereQ Art gtOn the contrary Augustine says De Virgin. xix Both solid reason and the authority of Holy Writ show that neither is marriage sinful nor is it to be equaled to the good of virginal continence or even to that of widowhood.gtI answer that According to Jerome Contra Jovin. i the error of Jovinian consisted in holding virginity not to be preferable to marriage. This error is refuted above all by the example of Christ Who both chose a virgin for His mother and remained Himself a virgin and by the teaching of the Apostle who  Corinthians  counsels virginity as the greater good. It is also refuted by reason both because a Divine good takes precedence of a human good and because the good of the soul is preferable to the good of the body and again because the good of the contemplative life is better than that of the active life. Now virginity is directed to the good of the soul in respect of the contemplative life which consists in thinking on the things of God Vulgate the Lord whereas marriage is directed to the good of the body namely the bodily increase of the human race and belongs to the active life since the man and woman who embrace the married life have to think on the things of the world as the Apostle says  Corinthians . Without doubt therefore virginity is preferable to conjugal continence.I think the thing to understand is that the saints are all for holiness and they typically dont worry about the effects of everyone suddenly becoming really holy because they know thats not going to happen. ,Catholicism,d02sp7v,2,t5_2qi4f

That rift is already down trodden enough by poor parenting. No one has a right however to have child that isnt their own .... So gay people wanting to have kids isnt a justification.And yet you deem this reason justified in the case of heterosexual couples. This is logically incoherent. No because they are still ordered in the the churches view of the marriage and many people who have been told they will not be able to have kids have had children. As long as they are open to the potential of children they are AOK. They can also benefit from the unifying power of sex in a marriage that requires one to submit oneself to their spouse and allow one another to correct each others short comings.Please see my above criticism which you have not responded to.

6813766,0,t1_d0nlk33,It is related to your question. It is in fact the answer to your question. Reception of Communion is not a sacrament. Communion is the act wherein one receives the Sacrament. In an ordinary Mass one sacrament takes place the transformation of bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Our Lord. In The Catechism of the Catholic Church  It is by the conversion of the bread and wine into Christs body and blood that Christ becomes present in this sacrament.And then in the discussion of Communion  The Lord addresses an invitation to us urging us to receive him in the sacrament of the Eucharist and  To prepare for worthy reception of this sacrament . . .To be valid a sacrament requires both proper form and matter. For baptism the matter is the water and the form is the Trinitarian formula. In Confession the form is confessing ones sins in number and kind and the matter is actually the sin itself. In the Eucharist the form is the Consecration and the matter is the wheaten bread and grape wine.Reception is not neccesarry for a valid sacrament as can be seen by the practice of reserving the Blessed Sacrament for Benediction and Adoration. You need to find an RCIA class that actually teaches the faith.,Catholicism,d0omyu8,2,t5_2qi4f

The authors explain that this result is difficult to reconcile with the idea of a conscious veto but simple to understand if the veto is considered an unconscious process. Thus it seems that the intention to move might not only arise from the subconscious but it may only be inhibited if the subconscious says so. This conclusion could suggest that the phenomenon of consciousness is more of narration than direct arbitration i.e. unconscious processing causes all thoughts and these thoughts are again processed subconsciously.Yes but this experiment later in the article seems to think otherwise.,Catholicism,d0oswa8,1,t5_2qi4f

I very very rarely come across liberal Catholics online and when I refer to what they have said they are dismissed by conservatives as cafe catholics. So online at least it seems the Liberals have been marginalised. I guess it is because the Catholics are angrier while the others just get on with their lives but I wish there was more of a Liberal balance online so one could discuss Catholicism in all its subtlety rather than  be given literally chapter and verse.

You are only allowed to receive the Eucharist a second time if you go to a full Mass though again I would refrain from this so just consuming the Eucharist in such a way that you described would be breaking canon law so a grave matter which combined with full consent and knowledge would make a mortal sin.Even priests have a maximum of three masses in a liturgical day that they can celebrate.

7083796,0,t3_4ciz0a,Im a cradle Catholic so never went away from the faith but have a technical style of thinking. I usually get hung up on trying to rationalize the bible into todays society. I have had plenty of doubt over the past few years with this issue. Ive gotten over most of it by doing bible studys. My wife and I participated in one last year that went through the story of Israel. It was a good chunk of the Old Testament and then Luke and Acts in the new. It wasnt a hugely in depth study that went verse by verse. It was a drive through of a lot of the major books of the OT Genesis Leviticus Numbers Kings Samuel etc.. It told the story of Israel and how God interacted with them throughout the different books of the bible and how a lot of it related. The OT made SO much more sense after that. Basically it came down to the fact that the OT was written thousands of years ago and has been translated a few times since then. We dontcant pick up on certain important facts here and there that really tie everything together. There is a reason Catholics are stereotyped as not reading the bible and priests having restricted it in the past. It can just be read at will an understood. It takes prayer dedication and research to actually understand it. Your rational side will be fine if you understand the original meaning and context of how and why the different books of the bible were written to and for. If you have any more questions please let me know. I can definitely relate to those struggles. And Im still struggling with some.,Catholicism,d1jbbtk,1,t5_2qi4f

Personally Im thankful to be Catholic. Being Protestant looks extremely difficult due to the lack of Sacraments such as the Eucharist and Reconciliation as well as the cognitive dissonance Id have to endure to be Protestant.

The state may be induced artificially but so are antiinflammatory properties of aspirin. Your body isnt operating incorrectly its natural process is to fight infection but we take this medicine for our own comfort. Likewise we are using birth control for the comfort of peace of mind rather than a desire to circumvent the natural order.gtThe problem is actively thwarting the opportunity at life being conceived.Using infertile periods is an attempt to thwart the opportunity of life being conceived. Hormonal birth control does not prevent conception. It prevents ovulation. It induces an infertile period through the bodies natural processes via stimulation from hormones.gt Questions like these help me learn more and challenge me to really understand what I believe! This is how I came to my understanding of this. I look beyond the statements as they are given and look to the reasoning behind it. I feel that what is being taught doesnt speak to the full truth of Humanae Vitae. I feel that the practice of it is due to a misunderstanding of the science at work and an overzealous attitude against the secular sexual revolution. I believe in order to condemn hormonal birth control you also need to condemn either palliative medical care because comfort is no excuse to alter the functioning of the body or condemn NFP because any action that seeks to cheat the natural processes of the human body is wrong. ,Catholicism,d224i4a,2,t5_2qi4f

Period in American English.But when he said punto it sounded like it could be molto which would be many.You can go to . in this video to hear for yourself So he didnt say many but he did say yes. So what did he mean by that yes? He said to go and refer to Cardinal Schoenborns presentation of the document to find the answer to the journalists question. I didnt watch or read a transcript of that presentation but I skimmed through a couple of articles on it earlier and I didnt see anything all that specific when it comes to a new opening on the issue of Communion for the divorced and remarried but I do want to reemphasise that I didnt watch or read Schoenborns presentation in full.The vagueness of it all is a headache and causes its own problems but that very vagueness I think also allows one to disregard any interpretation of this whole business that would be openly unorthodox.I think Pope Francis deserves a ton of criticism but I think we can also be relieved that certain explicit lines havent been crossed and at this stage Im not expecting to see those lines being crossed from this point on. Whatever is really in Pope Franciss head about this issue  I think its likely enough that he wont be revisiting it now in any major new way. The most I would expect would be more comments in homilies or wherever that could perhaps be taken as vaguely referring to it obliquely but which also might not be referring to it at all and that kind of thing but I doubt hell go further than that.

7348685,0,t1_d2crvku,Sorry for taking so long to reply I have not had the chance to sit down and respond until now and I also wanted to give this some thought and prayer. Ultimately I think there is a disconnect with our different views on fundraising. So Id like to explain the purpose behind it. What does the bible say about fundraising support for ministry? Luke  And remain in the same house eating and drinking what they provide for the laborer deserves his wages do not go from house to house. Before that Luke  says Carry no purse no bag no sandals and salute no one on the road. This is not to mean be totally impoverished and barely get by this is so that we must fully rely on the generosity of the Lord and the people He inspires to give to us.  Timothy  Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor especially those who labor in preaching and teaching  for the scripture says You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain and The laborer deserves his wages. Jesus says that those who labor for Him are worthy of support who am I to tell Him I am not?Am I supposed to be bound by money and squeezing by on juuuuust enough to do this work? What about emergency savings? What about being able to afford a plane ticket to visit home? This year four female missionaries in California had their apartment broken into purses computers and cars were all stolen while they slept in their beds. That obviously wasnt in their planned monthly budget. I had a student who was financially writtenoff by her parents this year and had to pay her own tuition. Because I had saved I was able to help her out. Missionaries do not live in extravagance but we also need to have the freedom to respond to Gods calling in whatever direction that is. All this aside this is not someone elses money that I am taking this is Gods money. This is not my money this is Gods money. He does not call us to be at the bare minimum. He calls us to live lives to fullest to be excellent and free to serve Him. It is a dangerous mindset to say that the bare minimum should be what we aspire to.  I dont know of any missionaries who are putting away  figures certainly no single missionaries. We have a cap that we cannot exceed in our fundraising set at  per month no where near the alleged  figures a year that you claimed. And I can tell you honestly that most missionaries are underfunded or at the goal not overfunded to this cap. The view of missionaries is often that we are lazy freeloaders who dont have what it takes to make a living and so we mooch off of others by preying on their desire to be generous with the Lord. Obviously you partly believe this when you tell me that I am not a fulltime employee the responsibilities are less the hours are less the commitment is less and its not a job. I respectfully disagree. True I do not punch a time clock or have a  to  schedule but that doesnt mean my hours are less. I am never clocked out. I have a schedule that I work with but my job demands me to be RADICALLY available to students at all times. Had a horrible breakup and show up to my apartment at pm? Come on in I am here for you. This is a job I take incredibly seriously and lasts yearround. The entire school year summer training the national conference during Christmas break spring break mission trips summer mission trips leave a few short weeks of the year to visit family and even then we are asked to spend a certain number of hours visiting with our mission partners and giving them our time. ,Catholicism,d2dhu2u,1,t5_2qi4f

7362459,0,t1_d2air5t,gtMy issue with this assuming Im not oversimplifying is that the transgender person wants to transfer the embarrassment from himself to the other patrons in the bathroom. When in a mens restroom other men dont know hes transgender and therefore arent embarrassed. Only the transgendermale is embarrassed. However while he wouldnt be as uncomfortable in the womens restroom all of the females in the restroom would probably feel slightly uncomfortable. This is completely mixed up. Most transgender people look like the gender that they have transitioned into. So the person with a penis who identifies as female and takes estrogen which causes breast development and a redistribution of facial fat thus leading to a feminine face will make men uncomfortable if he uses the mens room. But in the womens restroom which has stalls so no one sees the penis no one will be uncomfortable. Likewise the person born a woman who has a vulva yet now identifies as a man and takes testosterone and has a beard will make women uncomfortable if that person uses the womens restroom.Transgender people usually look like the gender they have transitioned into.,Catholicism,d2f27sl,1,t5_2qi4f

The violinist can have the pipe taken  out the next day. However this surgery will kill you in the process due to the nature of your injuries. Doctors conclude you have to wait around  months before youre ready. A week into the  months the violinist gets sick of you. He turns around and grabs a scalpel and starts hacking away at you.

God deserves our highest devotion and the saints less  but still a lot.

That may seem silly to you for me to point that out but modern secular medicine likes to hide that fact. They speak about the unborn children as just a clump of cells or speak about it as if it was some condition when they say We need to terminate your pregnancy. It is easier to kill a child when you use terminology which makes a child seem like a potential person instead of actually being one. To act like the baby is not really a baby until it is born.gt In some cases yes it is because it induces complications that otherwise would not be there. You dont want to go down that road. Just because something introduces risk it doesnt make it disease. By the definition you just established breathing walking and the desire for shelter can be considered a disease. It would be like saying exercise is a disease because you can pull a hamstring.gt In some cases though the pregnancy is directly the cause of danger to their lives through eclampsia and other things. The only cure is to end the pregnancy.No it is not. Pregnancy is not a direct cause of danger. Pregnancy can exacerbate other issues in the body. Pregnancy in of itself is not a disease. If it was then the vast majority of pregnancies would require some sort of medical intervention to prevent it from harming the mother or child.As for eclampsia it cannot kill you if treated which is why  of eclampsia deaths occur in rd world countries and in the vast majority of those cases it is because it went undetected. In addition eclampsia typically occurs after the th week of pregnancy which means in extreme circumstances it would only have to be treated for a few weeks and then the baby is viable and able to be delivered.gt Is this a common thing or a reason behind very many abortions? No. Is the pregnancy the cause and often an otherwise untreatable cause? Absolutely. That is a very silly argument. That is like blaming food for bulimia I wouldnt have to purge if it wasnt for all this food in my belly!gt This is why therapeutic abortion is occasionally the standard of care.It is only the standard of care for the same reason why a ton of people were given drugs typically reserved for Parkinsons disease to treat their BS restless leg syndrome. The customers want it and the doctors are pressured to give it. People are afraid of having a child who is disabled due to complications. In addition doctors are terrified of being sued when the baby is delivered with unforeseen defects. They are calling these cases wrongful life and they are increasing in number and success rate.Therefore when complications arise everyone involved would rather just terminate the pregnancy and try again. The medical establishment enables this behavior by making the decision easier for people by calling murder a valid medical treatment and their insurance companies thank them for it.gt Youre trying to create reasons to disbelieve the victim based on no facts whatsoever which is a very shitty thing to do.You are really trying to turn this into a problem arent you? Perhaps you should take a step back and think about it logically for a minute instead of trying to turn a nonissue into an issue.gt Trying to explain away a case based on literally nothing?But you are doing exactly that.

7553801,0,t1_d30ktuv,So for a religion in fiction to positively represent religion as a whole I take it that the fantasy religion have to be A True at least in some sense.  B Not malicious.  C Have champions who are competent.  There have been no religions in the past  sets that are any of these.  On Theros the Gods are literally imaginary.  They are manifestations of popular ideas that the inhabitants think about.  If the people on Theros ceased to exist so would the Gods.  Likewise Gods can die if people forget about the original idea behind the God.  They are also malicious because the main God Heliod kills the main protagnoist simply for knowing more than she does. Tarkir didnt have religion.  At best it had dragons as something to worship but the dragons are malicious.On Zendikar the only religions were created by the Eldrazi to deceive people about the true nature of the plane.  Enough said.On Innistrad Avacyn a once benevolent angel becomes insanely judgemental and starts killing people because they are too sinful.  The Church of Avacyn is also portrayed as super corrupt and hierarchical.Looking beyond those four sets you dont see much antireligion stuff in the cards themselves but especially when you look at the lore we see that religion is highlighted in ways that portray it as a vehicle of exploitation the Orzhov in Ravnica or evil Machine Orthodoxy on Mirroden.  In general IMHO religion is portrayed as more of an obsticle to overcome than something that makes people better.MTG has featured positive portrayals of religion in the past. The original Innistrad set and Avacyn Restored block is the perfect example of religion done right in my opinion But Avacyn is dead now after becoming an insane religious fanatic.. You also had Vronos in The Hunter Cannot Pity as a religious character done right. Vronos died in the same story he was introduced but he was compelling for an mtg character. Also the Selesnya are portrayed as hypocritical and somewhat naieve but I suppose they arent portrayed so badly. But on the whole the MTG lore is trends antireligious especially in the past few sets.This doesnt mean Im going to boycott MTG.  Im still going to play the game and buy cards because I dont think we should boycott authors or creatives just because they have different opinions from us.

If we insist on using swear words how is that helpful in making people see God?Edit I am surprised people are defending their position that swearing is okay. Its as if societys norm is just that norm. And I being higher than the society obviously can choose societally rude words to convey to another member of the same society without being rude.My goodness. Did we see Jesus being rude just to make a point that he is above society? Did we see him insisting on nonnormative behaviors just to highlight the fact that those behaviors are only social norms? No. Jesus is not an angsty teenager nor a college student who feels the need to assert his identity out of fear of being included in the society he lived him.No. In fact he judged Simon the Pharisee precisely by societys standards. Since the time I came you neither kiss me... but this woman...Paul reminded us to be good citizens. And therefore good members of the society.

7611985,0,t1_d3730nq,gt Even if one wants to criticise the lack of the actual word Russia in the consecration it remains that John Paul II did perform the consecration that he performed in . So even if one thinks that he failed to do exactly what the Fatima message had asked one would still have to admit that he didnt have an attitude of just ignoring the Fatima message altogether personally Im not an expert on Fatima but my understanding is that Sr Lucia said the  consecration was accepted by heaven and we all know that Soviet communism did collapse just a few years after that consecration was performed.I think it could be argued both ways and neither one of us can conclusively prove our point on this.  Yes John Paul II did the consecration and was generally a pretty strong devotee of Our Lady of Fatima.  On the other hand he did it in a politically correct way.  Could he have felt it would be politically correct not to directly call out Vatican II and the NO Mass by revealing this supposed rd Secret Part B?  Could he have felt that dealing with the fall out of Vatican II in a more gradual and subtle way was better?  I dont think its outside of the realm of possibility.As for Sister Lucia she gave differing responses first denying that the consecration was sufficient and then later claiming it was.  I believe the latter claim was made by way of a letter which of course could have come from anyone.As for the Soviet Union collapsing yes that is a point.  On the other hand we havent exactly faced the time of peace and prosperity since then which Our Lady promised have we?  Instead we have faced continual priestly sex scandals a continued drought of vocations church closings a world increasingly hostile to traditional sexual morality and continued pressure from within and without to compromise on various issues.But in any case the idea that being proFatima would involve being antiVatican II and antinovus ordo  again I dont see how that could add up without moving towards sedevacantism or some other kind of extreme stuff.We have had bad Popes and even antiPopes before I dont see why its hard to believe we have had one or more in recent times without recourse to sedevacantism.  We even have had times like when the Arian heresy reigned when the vast majority of the visible Church was in heresy.For better or worse in my opinion it is not quite that overt this time.  Vatican II largely can be read in an orthodox and continuous way in line with previous teachings of the Church.  However its problems like a lot of the pronouncements of the modern day Magisterium are ambiguity and unnecessary verbosity such that it becomes equally if not more possible to read the documents from Vatican II in a discontinuous and downright heretical manner.One need not even construe this as maliciously intended.  Its plausible that all relevant Popes and bishops had good intentions but subject to the traps of sin they gave into political correctness perhaps out of fear or vanity.,Catholicism,d37fyes,2,t5_2qi4f

7654663,0,t1_d3b2kj0,gtIts not a good idea to though.Yes. Although sometimes Canon law mandates you to. gt...  gtThus as Canon  of the Code of Canon Law states A person who is conscious of grave sin is not to celebrate Mass or receive the body of the Lord without previous sacramental confession unless there is a grave reason and there is no opportunity to confess in this case the person is to remember the obligation to make an act of perfect contrition which includes the resolution of confessing as soon as possible see also Canon .gtNote that the code requires a grave reason in order to avail of this exception.gtOne such grave reason is based on the principle of the good of souls. If a priest is required to celebrate Mass or a soul requests the sacrament of reconciliation the anointing of the sick or indeed any other sacrament from this priest that would have to be performed before he can avail of confession then he may and usually must administer the sacrament.gtA second grave reason stems from the danger of infamy by publicly revealing the state of ones soul.gtThis can occur in the case of a priest in isolated circumstances when there is no one else to perform the usual celebrations. There is no need for him to do anything that might lead people to suspect his lack of a state of grace.gtEven in the case that the priest or any other person has secretly committed a grave crime which would normally lead to his or her being automatically forbidden to receive the sacraments Church law in Canon  foresees the possibility of the penalty being suspended to avoid infamy or scandal to witgt. If a penalty prohibits the reception of the sacraments or sacramentals the prohibition is suspended as long as the offender is in danger of death.gt. The obligation to observe an undeclared latae sententiae penalty which is not notorious in the place where the offender is present is suspended totally or partially whenever the offender cannot observe it without danger of grave scandal or infamy.gtWhile the possibilities of a layperson or a religious in a state of mortal sin being placed in a similar dilemma as the priest are far rarer the same basic principles would apply should they occur.Emphases by me.

I highly doubt that.  First the human body needs certain nutrients and when those are low you will get cravings.  One of the most common is for salt  particularly for migraine sufferers.  Many migraine suffers say they have a salt craving right before a migraine headache.   Sometimes if they give in it will ease the pain of the overall migraine.  I dont think lumping them in and calling them gluttonous is a good thing.Also for the whole no moreno less.  Read nutrition labels sometime.  All of them give exact amounts for serving sizes and how many calories that is.  When someone is trying to watch their weight they will count calories.   Trying to calculate how many calories youve had in a day means getting measuring and counting.  Yes doing these things to excess can be a problem but you are also lumping in people that have diabetes into gluttony.  Gluttony may have caused the diabetes but the only way out is to measure and be exact and picky about what you eat.  As for work let other people be.

7791369,0,t1_d3rqlup,gt He is first among equals when it comes to disputes among bishops. The Orthodox would always come to Rome to settle disputes and Constantinople always recognized Rome as first among peers. So that is not in any doubt.Debatable but regardless youre right that this specifically is beyond any doubt. Even the Ecumenical Patriarch takes this role in the Eastern Orthodox communion because it is the role Rome would have if the two groups were one.gt Ex cathedra is the ability for the Pope to solidify a belief already agreed upon.Also debateable. In practice I would suggest that it this has taken the role councils used to play in the Church. But supposing youre right in regards to your next point...gt If the Pope was supreme in the way most Orthodox claim he is he could infallibly declare Billy the Golfer as an apostle....From what I can tell the concept of this at least while the example you give is obviously silly is what has effectively been happening edit my wording was poor there under the papacy since the Great Schism. Completely new things new ideas new teachings etc. can be added to Catholicism if it seems to fit. Worst of all unlike in previous times it cant realistically be challenged. And I cant make myself play the game Catholic conservatives read in the light of tradition what this document is really saying is that... are playing since it just doesnt match the way the early Christians Ive read about dealt with the issues of their own times. Christians didnt just reinterpret stuff to make it somehow work back then. Such a thing was a foreign idea to them. They met in councils they excommunicated each other they squabbled and fought and did all sorts of messy things. St. Athanasius bribed a bunch of the bishops at the first Ecumenical Council so they would have a nonArian majority! But what they never did do is go along with whatever the Pope of Rome said reinterpreting stuff as they went along and calling it orthodoxy. To put it simply reinterpreting things to fit with tradition is itself untraditional!Honestly theres more to it than this yet I have to admit that I cant do a great job of explaining the opinion Ive come to hold.

7812132,0,t3_4mb8o3,Here is an answer written in mostly secular terms that no intellectuallyhonest atheist could possibly deny.Do you think that truth is real? Or do you believe that everything is relative? The nature of ultimate truth is such that it needs to be beyond human understanding otherwise it would become subservient to the flaws and errors of human systems. Kurt Godels incompleteness theorems tell us that human reasoning will always be fundamentally flawed and that we need to hold a set of core axioms which suprarationally transcend our fallible and incomplete logical systems in order to have any knowledge at all. The idea of core axioms represents a transcendent concept of truth which leads directly to God.But suppose that you dont believe in truth and rather believe in absolute relativity which properly speaking means that you believe in nothing. There is no reason to believe in nothing and the concept of nothingness has nothing supporting it for example the statement Nothing is meaningful is itself meaningless under this framework. Taking a leap of faith towards absolute transcendent nihilism you end up believing in a concept of nothing which infinitely binds the universe together and makes up reality. But this concept of a transcendent nothing is actually just another way of looking at God.Therefore the choice between absolutetruth or absolutenothing is not actually a choice at all. Ultimately both ways lead to the Absolute which is God. Consider how our world was literally formed ex nihilo from the nothingness of the Big Bang to the infinity of the constantlyexpanding universe. Or consider how in calculus an integration of infinite zeros can add up to one. Of course relative truth and relative nothing are still meaningful concepts which arent at all identical with one another but the concepts of relative truth or relative nothing are just human words that dont really mean anything compared to the Absolute.The atheists response to this argument assuming that he responds at all is usually that the Absolute Truth must exist but that it is not the same as God. Its your call whether or not you think this response is reasonable at all. Catholic metaphysicians have been arguing for over a thousand years why God and the Absolute Truth are the same. I hope that this has solidified your faith.,Catholicism,d3u5clo,2,t5_2qi4f

The legal battles are little more than a defense of the right to be a Catholic business leader.But in parishes throughout the country you see the Knights of Columbus various prolife groups and CCD.  They feed the hungry clothe the naked harbor the harborless visit the sick and the imprisoned bury the dead instruct the ignorant and like everyone else at Mass pray for the living and the dead.  How many unborn lives have been saved by these people?  How many mothers comforted and saved from the cultures lie that abortion is a solution to their struggles?  How many postabortive parents helped to find forgiveness?  How many of the poor saved by their work?  How many seminarians able to reach ordination because of their financial help?  These groups vigorously perform the works of mercy!Sadly the world doesnt like us being free to do this.  So groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor have to have their time and resources wasted by the government.  And the courts have ruined the livelihoods of families for not attending a gay wedding ceremony creating more families in need in the process.  Thats why the court cases are so important.

The only requirement for this type of thing is that what you are buying cant be immoral nor can it go directly towards buying something immoral.Example  Buying an abortion is not morally acceptable because abortions are wrong.Example  Buying a brownie at the abortion clinic bake sale is not morally acceptable. Buying a brownie isnt immoral but if its sold as part of a fundraiser for an abortion clinic your money is going directly to funding abortions.Example  Buying a brownie at a bakery which employs someone who purchases an abortion with their salary is moral. It isnt immoral to buy a brownie. The purpose of a bakery is not to fund abortions. It isnt immoral to pay someone a fair wage for their baking skills. It is immoral for the employee to purchase an abortion but that isnt the fault of the person who pays them for their baking skills.,Catholicism,d4qnztu,1,t5_2qi4f

We would have to send massive amounts of armed policemilitary into neighborhoods and houses to get the illegal immigrants and send them back. It would be the Ellian Gonzalez fiasco times  million. People would undoubtably die either by accident or irrational decisions fueled by fear. Wed look like the goddamn SS sending Jews to the ghetto. Is this moral? Would Jesus support this? How can we as Catholics support something like this?As for the shut down from dangerous countries... There is currently genocide happening in the Middle East. Genocide.

To add an example to your list in good faith Universities discriminate based on grades. They do so to select students likely to succeed in their chosen field of study. Therefore it is just to discriminate. That might feel bad to Timmy and his C and we feel bad for Timmy but it does not follow that we should let Timmy into Harvard Law. I think we both agree up to this point am I right? So where we disagree and where the Church and I disagree is whether the discrimination of the Church in excluding homosexuals from the Sacrament of Marriage is justified.

The average American Catholic is not taught what the Church teaches about anything is not taught any of the tough parts like heresy or the duty of confession or I bring not peace but a sword is taught that the teachings on sex starting with contraception are simply optional......and Pope Francis came along and basically confirmed that the Catholic Church doesnt care about all that anymore particularly but hardly exclusively through Amoris Laetitia.  Francis is a very good man who is a very bad pope like Pope St. Celestine V.

If OP wants to go directly to the Roman Church I dont see why thered be impediments. Priests and other clerics who dont welcome converts or adherents from elsewhere into the Catholic Church are part of the problem and must be expelled because they are enemies of the Catholic Church by sabotaging Her witness. I am baffled that they are still in their places. As for the OrthodoxfromCatholic conversions it gets tricky because not everyone accepts the Catholic mode of baptism some say immersion is the only absolute correct form and any Catholic who wants to be Orthodox must be baptized not rebaptized according to them by immersion other Orthodox Churches think that they only need to be Chrismated Confirmed because despite the sprinkling or pouring as emergency baptism practice they are still technically valid. Perhaps theyd decide on an individual casebycase basis because Orthodoxy is not very legalistic and cutanddry on the issue. ,Catholicism,d5qnytj,3,t5_2qi4f

8429819,0,t3_4v2ret,I think there are some great replies here already but as a female RCIA participant who is also struggling with the Church teachings on sexuality and finding it hard to abstain from sex with my fiance until our wedding in a few months I can definitely relate to what you wrote.First of all I just want to reiterate what other people here have said about the women being less sexual thing nowhere that I know of is that part of Catholic doctrine. In fact one of the aspects that drew me to Catholicism was the faiths understanding of the unity of the spiritual with the physical. The whole idea behind the sacraments is that they are physical ways we can experience the divine nature of Gods grace. Especially here in the Southern US Catholics are one of the only Christian denominations that celebrates the joy of sex without descending into wishywashy theology to do so. And the Church spent centuries fighting a movement Gnosticism which largely sought to vilify the physical aspects of the world and exalt only the spiritual aspects. So even though Im not Catholic yet I feel fairly confident in assuring you that you can have a healthy sexual drive as a female and still be a perfectly devout Catholic woman in fact if youre in a vocation of marriage frequent sex would be a natural result of a healthy love between a husband and wife.As for this statementgt I dont suppose any other women have really struggled like me?Realize that you are not alone I myself recently came off of birth control have taken up to learning the Creighton Method to facilitate Natural Family Planning within my relationship and as a preparation and conviction of my decision to become Catholic have been trying to abstain from masturbation porn and sex with my fiance. I am not doing these things because they are easy to doif there is any recurring theme I have picked up on about being Catholic is to never expect faith to be easy to act onbut I am finding that sometimes you need to do something first before you fully believe in its meaning or efficacy. I still have my doubts about the ultimate moral nature of masturbation and many days I question why exactly I cant have sex with a man I have already decided to marry. Sometimes these thoughts get the better of me and I sin. But that is why Confession is such an important sacrament youll be surprised how much more cognizant you are of your actions when you get into the habit of regularly telling another human being about your personal shortcomings.Also at least near me the RCIA programs give you several months to absorb everything that the faith offers and requires of its adherents. If you dont get some of the sexual teachings now thats okay you have plenty of time to learn and pray about it. Praying is an important but overlooked part of it as someone going from not being religious to converting to Catholicism prayer is one of the most foreign aspects to me. And yet prayer does help I would say that it opens your heart to new directions and intentions but honestly Gods grace probably has something to do with it. For instance early on in considering conversion I noted that neither me nor my fiance who is nonreligious and not converting desired children which is at odds with the Churchs teachings. I figured this would be the issue that would do it for me the one that would keep me from being Catholic. And then slowly I started thinking Could I see myself as a mother in any instance or situation? The weeks passed and while I started to soften to the idea I was sure my SO would not. I hesitantly started bringing up the question of children he hesitantly said it was something we could talk about later in the future. I worried about what this meant for me becoming Catholic in the near future and whether I could remain faithful to both my future spouse and my future Church. You know what happened one day? We were in the car and he said he had been thinking and came to the conclusion of whats the point of bettering the world if there are no good people around after us who are able to keep bettering it? He said this without any prompting or context from me. He also recognized that it was not just about us that both of us needed to look outside of our personal circumstances and at the larger picture on the question of children. It was him subtly endorsing or at least rationalizing the idea of us having children and while he would probably disagree maybe a little of the Holy Spirit working through him too. I should note I am still worried about some aspects of being a parent pregnancy seems scary as shit I do not look forward to sleepless nights with a screaming infant what if the child has a health problem etc. But me and my SOtwo formerly nonCatholic people who were firmly against the thought of having children when we metare now open to the idea of having a child which is all the Church asks from us. It was like a personal miracle that acted as a sort of proof in my very life the that the Church may in fact possess the Truth that she claims to possess. My whole point of that story is remain open to the idea that issues you today see as roadblocks to faith may transform into personal miracles that demonstrate the power of that faith. Be patient with yourself but do keep challenging yourself to really assent to the spirit of the Churchs teachings not just the letter of them.

8432162,0,t3_4v4uc9,Give yourself a vision of hope. Its helped me to envision a version of myself thats free from the draw to my usual sins. If the person that you envision yourself to be doesnt really sound like you dont take that to be a bad thing. Maybe thats just you recognizing that theres a lot in your life that make fighting your temptations really difficult and that gives you something to work with. If you have difficulty having any vision at all. Pray to Christ that you may be more like him in his chastity which is a lot more than just sexual purity. Pray that you would receive the strength to uphold your own dignity as a man I assume and the dignity of others especially those to whom you are sexually attracted. That vision of yourself will come. Its precisely what youre praying for.By the way as you do this dont be discouraged at how little progress you make. Ive been struggling with the same habit for about a year or two now since taking this approach and I can still barely make a week or two at my best. Under the circumstances it sounds like its not working but on the other hand it used to be easier counting the days I didnt masturbate or look at porn and you have no idea how much I no longer sink into despair or depression because of my failings. Its been easier to get up accept that Ive fallen yet again and form an even stronger resolve to try again. Each time Ive received another taste of being the chaste man that both Christ and myself desire and Im thankful to have known it because now I know its real and Im closer to that goal than I was before. I have hope now that I never had before and while I hesitate to say that one day I will finally be free of this because I dont to give myself reason procrastinate I now have a much stronger confidence that I wont let myself be as easily overcome again because of the strength Ive been given in that hope.Whats more is that I spend far less time being consumed by guilt and I spend more effort on valuing the company of my friends and family for who they are rather than being distractions away from my habitual sins. Neither is my work my hobbies and my prayers just distractions either. I value those things for who I do them for and the goodness inherent within them. That is what persistence in confession has won for me. Because I didnt stop neither did Christs grace cease working on me and I found myself more and more desiring to offer God my struggles with these sins.Even in times of great shame because of my sin I had to accept the fact that I still cared for the people around me. Knowing that the value of my prayers and actions were diminished by my impurity gave me some sense of urgency but it was the hope that Christ gave me in my persistence prevented that from becoming my discouragement.Hope that helps.,Catholicism,d5vk7au,2,t5_2qi4f

In both cases we use inductive logic as no deductive evidence is available. The evolutionary case has a scientific priesthood as its basis for the inductive conclusion while creationists have masculinity as a basis for induction.Regarding koolaid in science often times only models are tested and this is getting worse with increasing computer power. Many of the truths that people think exist are only inductive conclusions based on computer simulations not deductive and evidencebased theories. Hypotheses and theories based purely on induction can be wildly off the mark as even a tiny error in the initial assumption can cause massive and multiplying errors. Induction is useful and can be proof in itself in maths. For every topic with even the slightest possibility of varying hypotheses induction is woefully inadequate.To your final point that science does get us closer to absolute truth even if only by approximation C.S. Lewis addressed this in his book The Four Loves. Truth is not  dimensional where the choices are either closer or farther away. Truth is D or higher in dimensions where a step on the path towards absolute truth often carries us for a moment farther away to the actual point of absolute truth. A mountain path can lead us away from the summit for a time while leading us to the summit.Macro evolution is leading us away from the summit at the moment even if micro evolution is useful in certain scientific pursuits.,Catholicism,d5x8dza,1,t5_2qi4f

8506723,0,t3_4w8eiw,This is a good question well thought out and reasonable. So thanks for bringing it here!Let me propose a counterclaim The Holy Spirit guarantees holiness and sanctity of life individually but he guarantees authority of doctrine institutionally.What am I trying to get at? Well your primary objection is this The Holy Spirit engenders holiness True We Catholics claim that our doctrine is protected by the Holy Spirit Therefore we ought to see the professors of that Holy Spirit guarded doctrine living Holy Spiritified lives. The way youre getting from Premise  and  to conclusion is by assuming whether consciously or subconsciously that the doctrine originates at the same personal level as does individual sanctity.But instead I argue that it does not. God can use sinful people as mouthpieces of his truth. Think King Saul evil though he was he never lost his position as Gods anointed ruler of the Israelites. Think of Judas the very betrayer of Christ was still counted as a disciple and sent out to perform works in nearby towns.So instead heres what I believe Doctrine is guarded by the Holy Spirit.  Doctrine can be preserved absolutely because doctrine has no free will People are made holy by the Holy Spirit People may be holy or less holy as their free will dictates God never violates this even if he has a special mission for us Sinful people may be chosen by God for good things THEREFORE from the above we conclude that there is no necessary contradiction between a Church full of sinners and doctrinal purity.Note that I dont show here that the doctrine actually IS revealed by God Thats a toooooootally different argument based on different principles. I only show that theres nothing wrong with holding both The Churchs doctrine is true and those who proclaim it are not always holy simultaneously.,Catholicism,d64w935,11,t5_2qi4f

8508298,0,t3_4w810d,I am a member of an FSSP Parish and there can be a lot of people who come in off the street and want to get involved some of whom do it not for the right reasons. If people want to get involved the clergy typically ask that people come to our social functions and get to know others in the community. The clergy may even ask to meet with people one on one just to talk. When I joined the parish i met with the priests and we talked about all manners of things from current events our stories to theology and how we understand certain concepts. It was good for both the priest and I to understand where we were coming from and for him to understand my motives for choosing the parish and also learning my interests and talents to better understand how I could assist the parish.I dont think it is odd at all. It would be no different if you were a member of an organization that had specific aims and principles and someone wanted to join and start helping out right away. Wouldnt you want to get to know them to understand their motives for wanting to join and help as well as to make sure that they understood your organizations principles and goals? Sometimes when we are feeling out of place we may react negatively to the actions and words of others we may perceive people as being cold or unwelcoming. I know I have felt this way at new parishes before. I always like to take a step back and ask myself whether or not I am feeling out of place because of my own feelings or is it really the actions of others. I also like to try and see the actions of others charitably and to understand where they are coming from and why certain rules are in place. More often than not I find that the rules make sense and the procedures are practical and that it is my own insecurity or my own perceptions that are skewed. ,Catholicism,d653ckm,6,t5_2qi4f

Edit  According to wikipedia these are the conditions for the privelege to even be considered The petitioner if baptised and Catholic at the time of the marriage in question must intend to marry a baptised Christian soon after or in the future or if nonbaptised or baptised in another Christian Church must either intend to enter the Catholic Church or be baptised in it or intend to marry a baptised practising Catholic. and again this only applies to unconsummated marriages and only by the action of the pope himself.,Catholicism,d6a70ps,1,t5_2qi4f

8614574,0,t1_d6id0ue,The Catechism is not infallible. Its technically not even authoritative like something like the Code. Many people disagree with that section. It also is out of sync with most history of the Church.The death penalty has always been a punishment in Catholic thought.Cardinal Dulles If the Pope were to deny that the death penalty could be an exercise of retributive justice he would be overthrowing the tradition of two millennia of Catholic thought denying the teaching of several previous popes and contradicting the teaching of Scripture notably in Genesis  and Romans . I doubt whether the tradition is reversible at all but even if it were the reversal could hardly be accomplished by an incidental section in a long encyclical i.e. John Paul IIs Evangelium Vitae focused primarily on the defense of innocent human life. If the Pope were contradicting the tradition one could legitimately question whether his statement outweighed the established teaching of so many past centuries.For more gtYou cannot licitly use death as a way of punishing a crime that is vengeance. Youve yet to justify this claim. All youve done is state it despite it being contrary to all of Catholic history. gtThe only time execution of a criminal is allowed is to protect the innocent which in our day and in firstworld countries is a nonexistent need.Untrue.

Guilt doesnt make you worried because when you feel guilty you know you messed up.Speaking from experience you already know that these are scruples not sins. My advice for what its worth is that the only way to combat scruples is to not validate them by fighting them. What I mean by this is the first instinct we have when we feel scruples is to try and rationalize why whatever we already know wasnt a sin wasnt a sin. So we try to come up with reasons and arguments as to why it wasnt a sin and as soon as we finally get over one scruple another one pops up. The thing is to even argue with the scruple is to give it credibility. You validate it by even saying that its wrong.

8676109,0,t1_d6prbua,Youre most welcome!  There is much study on typology that can be found online and in the writings of church fathers themselves much also found online.  But search the book yourself too!  Read the Gospels first and then read Genesis with the knowledge of the Gospels in you.  Realize too that John encourages you to do this!  Why else would he purposefully start his book in such a similar way?  In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God and the Word was with God... With In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth...  Start with Adam and see what is similar and what is dissimilar.  It will start out seeming coincidental and not much else... But as they grow in minute similarities and allegories you will see it is not unintentional. Then study Exodus the same and Leviticus and go through the Old Testament as much as you can! THATS the book you need to read D but others can give you their study notes as well to get you started.  Look at how theologians compare Jesus to Adam and Moses and Solomon  and for that matter St Peter with Eliakim.  THAT one is a tough pill for most Protestants to swallow but theres the truth.  The primacy of the pope IS in the scripture but it is less clearly spelled out than a simple reading of the words could express.  But trust me my friend  ALL of it is there!  May you find this truth and have the joy of Christ live all the stronger in you than I am sure it does even now as a Christian who is not yet Catholic.Right now Im reading the Confessions of St Augustine.  Its a beautiful read and I suggest it to you as well. Its not terribly long.  In addition I believe his name was Robert Payne wrote a book called The Fathers of the Western Church and The Fathers of the Eastern Church. But you call also search for the writings of St Cyprian St Ignatius St Irenaeus St Augustus St Jerome ect... They are openly available.  You can even search early Church fathers on .... Whatever topic you would like that you may take issue with our stance on.  Id love to talk more but its been a long day and I need to rest.  But please PM me or message here again to speak more!

Im sure He did not pick me out but rather that He nudged me enough for me to begin to break away my barriers and to work things out with His help. I tend to hold the belief that God is revealing Himself to us and Jesus extending His hand we are just too dumb and vain to take it and see.For example I was just watching a video with William Lane Craig and I did a little reasearch on the TV host and if you scroll down to the section on his faith on here you will see how this guy left the church then came back then left again. Then you see the reason he left in  is because he could not accept the doctrine on homosexuals. SERIOUSLY? Im sorry but there is so much the faithful go through so much testing and submitting and you left because of something like that? That man is not invincibly ignorant just a stupid fool with seemingly no view of the sacrificial and the true who leaves Holy Mother Church for those reasons and that does not make it some how ok to be excused from damnation his just punishment. Sure he might be an amicable chap sure he might really like Christ and be devoted to him but what kind of disciple does this?

8789860,0,t1_d749d98,Yes because I dont consider your points well substantiated. Let me breakdown what I imagine is a very literal oath. gtabsolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity Fidelity faithfulness to a person cause or belief demonstrated by continuing loyalty and support.I think you can agree that Catholics should have faithfullness to a belief represented by the Holy See considered by the US government to be a sovereign entity and that you quite possibly are loyal to the teachings of the Church and support it in a variety of ways. gt to any foreign prince potentate state or sovereignty Whether the Pope is a foreign prince or potentate is debatable but not one that Im interested in. Whether the Holy See is a state is debatable the only quote Ive found on its self perception as a nonstate was by the former Secretariat of State of the Holy See Cardinal Jean Louis Tauran which strikes me as satire. What I have read though is that the Holy See is considered a sovereignty at least within the US. I havent found any sources that contradict this.gtof whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen.I think this ties in a lot with what you said aboutgt I am not subject to the Holy See in any way comparable to the way I am subject to the US government.Because I disagree. To be a good citizen you  follow the laws of the government brought to you by those in charge. support the government  i.e. through taxes defend the government  such as through armsTo be a good Catholic you  follow the teachings of the Magisterium not any differently than laws.  support it financially as well  defend it whether theologically or in the past through arms Being a bad citizen or a Catholic in bad standing both have legal consequences. So am I a subject to the Holy See the oath is not exclusive to citizens  it says subject or citizen? I think that since I support it follow its teachings and that it also protects me i.e through treaties and influencing legislation I would say yes.  ,Catholicism,d74eosm,0,t5_2qi4f
8795437,0,t1_d752462,Having regular intercourse to show affection for ones spouse is just part of marriage. We honestly havent thought much of when I was fertile or not. We just love the ability to express our love to another in the way God gave us through marriage. And from this love springs kiddos! Christendom has gotten by in family life for a long while without NFP as part of this complete marital package so I think well be okay. Again if we ever need it itll likely be for a serious enough reason that abstaining in order to learn it will be worth it.And in terms of periodic abstinence being healthy I dont agree. There is enough periodic abstinence naturally woven into raising a family. Making love is a beautiful way to stay strong together in the rigorous life of raising a big family.

8821174,0,t1_d77mbyn,Im a current student at Father Ryan and I remember taking the human sexuality courses my freshman and sophomore years. With all due respect you have no idea what you are talking about. The course was in total concordance with Catholic Teaching. We were taught that abstinence was the only effective form of birth control other than NFP. We were never taught that premarital sex was licit. Yes they taught us about birth control but they made it clear that every form of artificial birth control was not in line with Church teaching. They taught that using NFP for illicit reasons selfishly not being open to procreation is against Church teaching. They included prices for all forms of birth control so that in the end they could point out that abstinence is not only free but it also the right thing to do. They talked about condoms and the pullout method but once more they educated us that these practices were deplorable and not in line with Church teaching. They taught us all of this so we could be informed about the ways of the Enemy. If we are ignorant to the ways of sin how will we repel temptation?Further yes they taught us about sexual pleasure but only in the context that the gift of sexual pleasure is secondary to the goal of procreation and marital unity. I will repeat it again pleasure is secondary to the goal of marital unity and procreation. This is what I was taught. If we are scared about or sheltered about the functions of the Godgiven gift of sexual pleasure how will we repel the temptations of the evil one? With blind ignorance? I was taught that premarital sex was immoral and that we could find more fulfillment in living chastely. I was taught that masturbation is misusing Gods gift of sexuality. I was taught that sodomy is one of the sins that cry out to Heaven for Vengeance. I hope I have countered each and everyone of your accusations. ,Catholicism,d786mzy,1,t5_2qi4f

The gruesome images and torture dont sound like that to me untrained layperson that I am.Saint Thomas Aquinas though talks about how angels are manifestations of Gods will Jesus Christ wills that all souls be united to Him through his death on the cross and that extends to ALL sinners whether their sin is murder stealing a candy bar or cussing.Before his conversion Saint Paul then called Saul was a professional Christianpersecutor Acts  He persecuted this way unto the death Acts  And he wrote  of the  books of the New Testament!We all deserve death for our sins. That includes me you Paul ISIS members your next door neighbor the Pope etc.. But Jesus redeems us and brings glory to God through how sinful we are. God through Jesus makes it so that even a man like SPaul who approved of stoning Christians like Saint Stephen Acts  can be inspired through the Holy Spirit to write some of the most beautiful words in scripture.Even  Corinthians  love is patient love is kind was written by this man who once performed and approved of many acts similar to those done by terrorists today.

8833491,0,t1_d79hizk,I guess what hangs me up then still and this could go with most practices of the Catholic Church is that more than  centuries passed before the Roman Catholic Church was truly established. It does irritate me when I hear Catholics claim that the RCC was established by Peter but by no means was the Church as massive uniformed and structured as it was during the time of the apostles. I know the RCCs argument would be that it is simply the grown version of the church founded by Peter which I guess I would be able to get behind if the growth was continual instead of explosively exponential as it was. The way I see it and the only way history as I know it can prove to be true is that the RCC was founded by Constantine and not by Peter. Just so many centuries had passed that it is a tall claim for me that the Church was founded by Peter. This is just how I feel about it Im not trying to be combative.Thank you about the purgatory information that is pretty cool.

9044079,0,t1_d7yxn6b,What youre saying makes sense. gt They do so wrongly. The doctrinal content of such encyclicals might be right but they are not guaranteed to be right by virtue of infallibility because they dont define anything.This is the big issue I think. Ive come across this article which has some interesting pointsIn  however two American moral theologians  Jesuit Father John  Ford and Germain Grisez  published what is probably the most important theological  article to date analyzing and applying Vatican IIs doctrine.The article in the journal Theological Studies argued at length that  the teaching that every act of contraception is intrinsically wrong has been proposed infallibly by the  ordinary magisterium.In reaching this conclusion Father Ford and Grisez traced the history of  the teaching on contraception over many centuries and examined the manner in which it was  proposed by countless bishops in their individual exercise of teaching authority.Even if a substantial number of bishops now or at some time in the future  were to be doubtful about the teaching or not accept it that would have no bearing on the  fact that the conditions for infallible teaching already have been met they argued.AndIn a Nov.  address to members of the Congregation for the Doctrine of  the Faith Pope John Paul expressed regret that many Catholics apparently think they are at  liberty to dismiss doctrines they dont agree with unless it is formally stated that they are  infallibly proposed.Different teachings do have different degrees of authority he said. But  he added That does not authorize people to think that pronouncements and doctrinal decisions of  the magisterium require irrevocable assent only when it presents them with a solemn judgment or  definitive act.So the teaching against contraception may be infallible despite that fact that Humanae Vitae is a fallible document because it reiterates a longheld and arguably universal teaching of the bishops of the Church. Until an ex cathedra statement on the issue is provided the infallibility of the teaching depends on whether or not it can be proven to be universally held by the bishops. Nevertheless the teaching should be adhered to even if it is not infallible. Would you say this is a correct understanding of the Catholic position? ,Catholicism,d7yyc6e,1,t5_2qi4f
9045767,0,t1_d7yx8lu,gtAnd yet people treat the teachings in it as if they were infallible.Well lets be a bit more clear on the subject.

If it says you cant X and you dissent you still cant X otherwise you are being disobedient. . You cant try to openly oppose the teaching or subvert the teaching publicly. . Any disagreement you have is to be taken up formal channels within the Church starting with your confessor. If you are clergy then by following your path of obedience. . You are bound by duty in dissent to read and learn all relevant theological matters concerning the issue and follow the formal guidance of your confessor in learning the matter and approach the issue from the mindset that of submission trying to see and understand the Churchs point of view.. You are required to do this and keep doing this until you either agree with the Church or She agrees with you. Most people do not do half of what they are supposed to do in dissent from a noninfallible teaching. ,Catholicism,d7z5nbg,1,t5_2qi4f

9113669,0,t3_552ohv,A bit of the problem with the hypothetical is the time in which the evil act occurs. So take the hitman scenario. There are TWO evil acts that occur. One the paying of the hitman to kill. Two the actual killing. Now take the sterilization scenario. How many evil acts occur. In my estimation ONE definitely occurs and the second only occurs if intent is attached to the sexual act. Sterilization is objectively evil. Thats the one. But sex when you are sterile is Not objectively evil. Its only evil insofar as you intend not to have children or subvert your child making abilities in having the sex. Now repentance would cover the first acts in both scenarios. Repenting of the hiring of a hitman and repentance of the sterilization. But note you dont undo either sin by reversing them. The repentance is the fixing of the evil acts. The acts are done. Past. If you look at pornography repenting of it doesnt make it so youve never looked at pornography. It makes it so that sin is forgiven resolved addressed. Now you can further divert or stop the other evil act from taking place calling off the hit which in this case you would have a moral obligation to do because you set the evil act in motion and can prevent it. But in the case of the sterilization you arent diverting or stopping the other evil act because that act sterilized sex is only evil if you possess the appropriate evil intent while committing the sexual act. You can stop that evil act simply by not having a contraceptive intent in the sex. Now you may have a moral duty in a broad sense to make sure your marriage is fertile in general but you wouldnt necessarily violate the moral duty of having opentolife sex by having sex while sterilized whether sterilized by yourself or circumstance. Some thoughts is the hitman act actually two acts and two separate evils? It seems so to me but it could perhaps be seen as one long drawn out single act. The same with the sterilization and the sex that follows. But that argument is more difficult to make. And as I noted even if both the hit and sterilizationsex are one single act the changing of the intent on the sterilization scenario would cleanse the act of its evil. It would not in the case of the hitman murder.,Catholicism,d87bdrj,5,t5_2qi4f

While sex may not be for entertainment I doubt all but the most pious Catholics have never had sex for enjoyments. And yes if you cannot afford to go out to the movies or dinner there is probably a better chance you will end up having sex. I dont think most people say Im feeling extra holy tonight I guess that means sex Hell I replace sex with TV every night. And rarely my favorite TV show. gt Secondly people start their sexual lives way earlier than the previous generations have way more sex than before and in general we live in the golden age of promiscuity. People in rich countries just cant be bothered with having children any more.Just another reason to exercise better population control. But people dont start their sex lives earlier now. Im pretty sure through much of history  year old girls were commonly married. Every one on Earth should be thanking baby Jesus the I wont have kids. At best their kids and my kids will not have to compete for jobs in an ever decreasing market. At worst my descendants wont have to kill your descendants or vice versa for decreasing amounts of drinkable water food or energy to take care of their families. ,Catholicism,d8a4rnw,1,t5_2qi4f

9179030,0,t1_d8ffeq0,Im sorry that the two of you are dealing with tricky cycles. It makes NFP way harder and can really extend the abstinence. I remember telling the couple that taught us that we were having trouble with abstaining and they told us some platitudes  then we took out the chart and they were shocked that we were talking about more than a month without an available day. Counseling sounds like a great idea  you both deserve extra support while dealing with something this difficult!Id really encourage you to keep encouraging your wife to seek help for her cycles. It took so much reassurance and support to get me to even make an appointment. Im actually pretty sure that my husband found the doctor for me and dialed the number. Weve had great experiences with NaPro doctors even though we dont really chart Creighton learned just enough to answer a few questions my doctor had.Not sure of your wifes reasons for avoiding diagnosistreatment but before getting married I had a terrible experience with a doctor. I had gone in complaining of classic hypothyroid symptoms and my doctor ran blood work that clearly showed a thyroid problem but she ignored the test results and told me that I was just anxious about getting married. She also told me that the only treatment for irregular cycles was birth control and that since I wasnt willing to take it there was no point in trying to figure out the cause. It took another two years before I went back to another doctor. When we finally found a great doctor the fix was so easy. Within  weeks of starting thyroid medication my symptoms were basically gone and my cycles became incredibly regular.Let me know if you have any questions! Happy to PM with you or your wife about finding a doctorlooking at charts if that would be helpful. ,Catholicism,d8fic60,6,t5_2qi4f

The idea doesnt reject resurrection but it does risk rejecting the idea that the body itself is good.

9553414,0,t1_d9pgazn,gtThis is still skirting around the issue of killing BABIES. It really isnt because Amalekite children are still Amalekites and would have gone on and attempt to annihilate Gods people like in the Book of Esther. Whatever the case as this conversation has gone on I realize that the moral symbolism interpretation might just in fact be a better interpretation of  Samuel  rather than taking it as a literal historical accounting though I would tend to give this interpretation more primacy generally. And it isnt because I dont know how to resolve the dark passage issue but because it better explains Israels unique situation with Amalek. Afterall God only targets out one tribe specifically for total destruction and gives Israelites special laws about them such as never forgetting what they did and blotting out their name. This is rather odd and raises inquiries that lead to mirkier areas such as why Amalek and not the other enemies?But returning to your considerations Im forced to say that I can rightly think of an appropiate response and that I need to investigate deeper into related passages and historical interpretation to better understand how the Jews and the Church have made sense of this piece of Scripture. You make excellent points and questions and as seeing how Im eerily getting close to Divine Command Theory and away from Natural Law Theory I think its best that I concede for now. That being said I hope you also investigate the passage and see if you can find a satisfying answer to your questions. For the moment I dont think Im rightly equipped to give it you for now and these questions are just as heavy for you as they are for me. ,Catholicism,d9qnm0k,1,t5_2qi4f

9574737,0,t1_d9t8o22,There are huge amounts of Christians in North Africa  and theyre spreading down into Western Africa much like Moslems IRL they have no Patriarch as they were under the Pope but they do have a mean independent streak and are known for their excessively violent pogroms against Donatists often led by clergy themselves were eventually killed off around .However in the story theres a huge campaign by the HRE to retake Rome with a bull by the Patriarch of Canterbury declaring anyone who fought the antipope to be free from the dangers of purgatory. The Roman campaign ends in them capturing Photius III and burning him to death on his own iconostasis that he built in St Peters. They take this opportunity to capture all of Italy under the Carolinian throne Sicily proved difficult to take though and remains outside of the throne to this day. This whole ordeal out massive strain on eastwest relations and results in the Pope of Alexandria a Photian supporter sending a letter to the Emperor of the HRE and Byzantium warning that the whole ordeal has put great strain on the unity of the church and has put Christianity in great peril of attacks from the vampires and warns that a divided church would soon be a dead church if they continued down this path. Begrudgingly they both agreed to meet at the great Concordance of Urbino where they officially delineated the border between the HRE and the Byzantines and the borders of the various patriarchs under them. They most importantly agreed to call an cumenical council in Athens the next year and to elect the Patriarch of Baghdad as the new Pope  since he was outside of both their jurisdictions  who took the name of Pope Nicholas II.All the bishops recognized the new Pope  some under pain of execution if they did not. Within a decade the matter was settled with much bloodshed.Edit after they burned Photius III on his own iconostasis they took his bones and cast them in molten gold taken from his own vessels that he used to consecrate the hosts and other Byzantine vessels they put these bones on display in Rome and performed a Latin mass in St Peters with the bones placed in the doorway so all congregants had to walk on or over them.

9636008,0,t3_5cx5im,I visited my grandmother in the nursing home yesterday. While sitting with her one of the other residentspatients still not sure about the terminology asked what I did for a living. I told her that I was a stayathome dad to our two boys. Her response What a bunch of baloney! Who ever heard of such a thing? A man is supposed to be strong!This is usually the response I get from older generations. It also sounds a lot like parts of this article. The last paragraphs emphasis on manly pursuits is presented with a notsosubtle implication that a mans interests ought to be aligned with roughandtumble coarseness a smokefilled parlor replete with cigars brandy and offcolor jokes or I guess hiking. My churchs Knights of Columbus chapter consists of mostly grumpy seniors making disparaging comments about minorities over coffee. Is this what you had in mind? What is an appropriately manly challenge for me?Ill answer my own question. When I first became a stayathome dad I questioned everything about myself. Had I failed as a husband that I could not provide for my family? Was my wife by virtue of her second Xchromosome better suited to care for our kids? Had I forfeited my man card when I committed myself to changing diapers and going on play dates? My parents made no secret of their disdain for our decision my motherinlaw asked my wife how a man who couldnt keep his job could possibly care for a newborn. My friends called me Mr. Mom. The bagger at the grocery store to this day asks me if Im babysitting when I take the kids to get groceries. The manliest challenge whatever that means your article doesnt really say has been keeping my chin up when many of the people in my life  both loved ones and casual acquaintances  said I was a man doing a womans job. If its insulting to a woman to say that she would be bettersuited to parenthood than the workplace then it is also insulting to say to a man that he is better suited to working than parenting.Im not offended by your article Father neither is it my intent to offend you or insult you. But your article left me scratching my head about whether Im manly enough for you. Of course ultimately your opinion isnt really important to me. Im fully confident in my masculinity and Im also to set humility aside for a moment a pretty kickass dad. Thats as manly as it gets. ,Catholicism,da0u52b,8,t5_2qi4f

9645478,0,t1_da17xqc,Dude its perfectly possible for a woman to want her own income have her own worldly accomplishments and be family oriented. The word worldly accomplishments is too often demonized especially for women. I know lots of females working in various industries so their children can have better opportunities move to neighborhoods with better schoolssend to private school.... Also having a mother who is familiar with the outside world will better prepare kids for the real world where there isnt coddling and the mothers can give kids more solid advice for life in the capitalist world like it or not that is the world we live in. Ive noticed kids that werent so coddled by their mommies and less sheltered are more mature and prepared for adult relationships and responsibilities. We have children to prepare them for their adult life in the adult world not to remain little kids forever. Once the kids are grown with their own lives what is the mother supposed to do? Having a mother who is financially independent doesnt herald the end of family. Perhaps it is you that needs a stayathome wife so you do not have to be so engaged in cooking amp cleaning so you can go off into the world with a fulfilling career and enjoy the freedom of financial independence.Stayathome wives and mother indeed have a dull life because of very little social excursions and not challenged intellectuallythey will end up depressed and needy. Even prisons have what they call reduced isolation because reducing time to socialize with your peers will exacerbate mental or emotional issues. Trust me youre better off with a wife who also has worldly accomplishments rather than one confined to the home. The stayathome family oriented wife only seems nice in your mind they end up absolutely crazy amp controlling because their family is their only accomplishment. And yeah if this sounds personal it is...Ive seen too many dysfunctional families where the mother never worked. Marry a woman who can balance career and family...and you should be prepared to do the same.,Catholicism,da206br,2,t5_2qi4f

9651760,0,t1_da2pqxn,Partly. Even those who have nothing against religion dont go. Look at a non religious thing like rotary club for example. No more young people join it. Decades ago joining clubs doing chivalrous activities regardless if connected to religion or not was a foundation of development of the young man or woman. Many politicians today got their start in leadership through volunteering or church. This really isnt a thing anymore. People arent seeking these self development activities and assisting others. People are seeking the next best thing and self pleasure now. Its a cultural shift.  So the person with nothing against religion just doesnt go they dont see it as a activity of self pleasure. Most would rather spend Sunday watching football and going to a bar with friends or playing video games for example. People dont see free time as an opportunity to help the local community anymore.

9651964,0,t1_da2rpej,You are correct you need to have a shared framework to communicate. But I think that religion has a unique challenge in that they cannot point to anything in reality to substantiate their frame work. Religion is a fabricated frame work that is divorced from reality there is no evidence that can be pointed to that would allow an outsider to see merit in that framework. It only works for people who already believe often to their detriment.  As far as morality and human rights go you can point to real shared experience to make arguments to others that doenst rely on a religious frame work. You can point to the suffering of a slave and make valid ethical arguments against slavery. You can indicate the social benefits of honesty justice sexual responsibility and the equal application of law to members of society as facilitating a common good. What you cant do is point to reality and show the benefit of religious based arguments like banning abortion or contraception and opposing gay marriage as the evidence clearly indicates demonstrable benefit and very good reasons to do it. How do you reason without evidence? If you have two faith based positions in disagreement they are unresolvable. One will say my faith says this the other will say well my faith says this and there is nothing tangible between the two positions to seek a solution because they are based on faith and not evidence. The tangible world is where all the evidence is any frame work outside of that is going to continue to lose relevance in an increasingly fact based multicultural society.  years ago when everyone in a community all went to the same church and believed the same thing sure religious frame works could work because everyone you interact with believed the same thing. But thats not the case anymore we interact with people of other cultures and frameworks every day now so a religious framework is no longer useful for common understanding. Its the reason why secularism is advancing religious frameworks simply dont work in the real world. ,Catholicism,da2szag,0,t5_2qi4f

Youre really diving into intent and circumstances which are difficult to gauge but real components of moral decisionmaking. Prudence must dictate how far we are willing to go in this and similar situations to determine when the line between authentic witness to Christ and His Church for the salvation of souls specifically yours your girlfriends this couples and all those who would witness you and scandal is crossed. Clearly you could not attend a ceremony purporting to unite two individuals in a samesex marriage because of the scandal involved... Nor should you provide some service thereto such as the famous example of baking a cake for a wedding. But can you bake a cake for your friend who happens to have homosexual tendencies? Certainly. There is nothing morally wrong about baking a cake or breaking bread with someone as long as the witness is one of Christian discipleship and human dignity and its clear were not confirming them in sin. Its when this latter point becomes an issue  and it well may if either your girlfriend or the couple themselves force it  that you would have to make the difficult decisions of splitting off.,Catholicism,da3o6i5,30,t5_2qi4f

9758325,0,t1_dafssyl,Youll want to begin by preparing yourself for confession. You do this by examining your life since the last time you went to confession and identifying in what ways you have sinned. Many people use an examination of conscience like this one to help. Youll need to identify the serious sins youve committed that are against the  Commandments. Youll also need to know approximately how many times youve done them. Dont worry if you cant remember all your sins exactly just do your best. If later down the road you remember something you can mention it in a future confession. The important thing is that your stir up within yourself sorrow for your sins. This is not a despairing sort of sorrow but one that always acknowledges Gods love and mercy towards us.Next youll need to find a priest to confess to. Search for a Catholic parish near your area and call them or check their websites to find out when they offer confession. Usually parishes will offer confession before Mass.When you go to confession typically youll begin by making the Sign of the Cross. Then youll tell the priest how long its been since your last confession and what your state of life is i.e. married single etc.. Then you tell the priest your sins. You dont have to go into extensive detail. The priest just needs to know what sort of sin it is and how many times youve committed it. The priest will then give you some advice. He might ask you some questions to help in this. The priest will then give you a penance to do after the confession. This will probably be a couple of prayers. Then he might ask you to say an act of contrition. You can use one like this or you can just use your own words. The priest will then absolve you from your sins. To end he might say something like Go in peace your sins are forgiven to which you respond Thanks be to God. Then you go and say your penance and youre all done. If youre stuck at any point dont hesitate to ask the priest what to do next. Hope that helps!,Catholicism,dafxkbx,7,t5_2qi4f

9767862,0,t3_5f33s0,The Saints are basically role models for us. The Church teaches that these particular souls are already in Heaven and as such are excellent intercessors for us before God. We dont worship them or seek their personal acts. We merely ask them to add their prayers to ours.Beyond that they model good faith for us in their words acts and lives. We can read about stories of conversion. Saint Augustine for example lived a life that would make a pirate blush before finding his faith and eventually becoming an incredibly influential theologian. We can read about stories of selfsacrifice. Saints Joan of Arc and Thomas More are just two of many Catholics who went to their deaths rather than deny their faith. We can read stories about people who lived ordinary lives in extraordinary circumstances. Saint Joseph a humble carpenter in a backwater town became the stepfather of the Son of God and after ensuring his familys safety returned to a life of humility and relative anonymity living piously and dying without any fanfare or note.When you choose a patron Saint you are choosing a Saint after whom you hope to model your faith and life. These choices arent binding per se. You can always adopt a Saint as it were at a later time. When I was confirmed I chose Saint Hildegard of Bingen to be my patron Saint.

9779842,0,t1_daij2z8,Let me see if I can address some of your concerns just FYI I cannot post any further tonight so my reply to any additional questions will be pretty delayed.When discussing the morality of an action it is important to determine the purpose of that action as well as the intrinsic value of the action. Teleology address both of these concerns it not only determines the natural purpose of the action but it is also able to address the value of an action by discussing its natural result.Ill use an example here The action of murder. To see if this action is justified we look at the ends another dead human being not killed in selfdefense. Since this end occurs in all cases of murder the action of taking anothers life unnecessarily is a core feature of murder making murder an action that we cannot take.To the Why ProcreativeUnitive part Observation tells us this. From any perspective procreation is an obvious feature of sex. Modern science as well as a traditional western view of sexmarriage proves the unitive part as well.The reason why both have to be present deals with the application of Teleology to morals. For an act to be moral all of its proper ends must be fulfilled. I will present a cases as an example of this friendship.Now friendship is a really complicated topic so I am going to distill it for use here. Lets assume that the ends of friendship are spiritual mutual benefit and entertainment.If I am in a friendship that has only spiritual mutual benefit but does not entertain me in any way that relationship can be hardly classified as a friendship. In this case such a relationship would be some sort of teacherstudent relationship where a cold mutual benefit is being achieved.On the other hand if my friendship only contains entertainment and no spiritual benefit then my friendship is this fake valueless thing that hardly lives up to the name of a friendship. Such a relationship could even be harmful to me For example if the friend commits immoral acts and tries to get you to join in.Since both cases involve failed relationships that arent full friendships a friendship is only in its full capacity when both ends are met.The same goes for sex.TLDRWe know the two purposes through observation. It is a basic tenant of Teleology that for an act to be moral its ends must each be fully met.Let me know if you have any questions.,Catholicism,daikwoh,4,t5_2qi4f

You have persecution in the colonies the KKK taking aim at Catholics and today a general disfavor because of the moral values that Catholicism upholds. When John F. Kennedy was elected president in  there was some fear that the whole country would be subjected to the Popes authority through him or something along those lines.Coming from a lifelong protestant background politics are an integral part of a lot of those structures. For some protestant Christians their faith may be in Christ but their religion is either the Democrat or Republican party and the ideologies therein. I dont see this as being the same with Catholicism though. At most Catholics defend certain moral teachings of the Church which incidentally align them with a political partys ideology but other than that my experience thus far in the Church has been apolitical.In the protestants case thats what happens when in many cases the country you live in has more continuity than the denomination you worship with. A lot of the protestant denominations in America today were born during or after the time that the country was established. Whereas Catholicism transcends all of it is outside of Americas history and continuity and I think for some people it confuses them at best and alarms them at worst.,Catholicism,daka09v,27,t5_2qi4f

Saying this with a bit of snark when a woman got pregnant she would like a safe legal way to not be burdened by it.Saying it is just a bunch of cells or not a person feels more like a rationalization and not a motivation.,Catholicism,davejhz,1,t5_2qi4f

He had many attacks of illness but suffered still more from temptation. In the remotest part of a wild and stony desert he wrote years afterwards to his friend Eustochium burnt up with the heat of the sun so scorching that it frightens even the monks who live there I seemed to myself to be in the midst of the delights and crowds of Rome.... In this exile and prison to which through fear of Hell I had voluntarily condemned myself with no other company but scorpions and wild beasts I many times imagined myself watching the dancing of Roman maidens as if I had been in the midst of them. My face was pallid with fasting yet my will felt the assaults of desire. In my cold body and my parched flesh which seemed dead before its death passion was still able to live. Alone with the enemy I threw myself in spirit at the feet of Jesus watering them with my tears and tamed my flesh by fasting whole weeks. I am not ashamed to disclose my temptations though I grieve that I am not now what I then was.gtJerome added to these trials the study of Hebrew a discipline which he hoped would help him in winning a victory over himself. When my soul was on fire with wicked thoughts he wrote in  as a last resort I became a pupil to a monk who had been a Jew in order to learn the Hebrew alphabet. From the judicious precepts of Quintilian the rich and fluent eloquence of Cicero the graver style of Fronto and the smoothness of Pliny I turned to this language of hissing and brokenwinded words. What labor it cost me what difficulties I went through how often I despaired and abandoned it and began again to learn both I who felt the burden and they who lived with me can bear witness.

Im not going to get into the weeds of morality with you.  This is what secular morality is and suffice it to say I can define harm within my moral framework.gt What I am making fun of is placing such a high level of priority on desire. Imagine arguing with a child about why he cant have ice cream all the time. But it will be bad for you you say. How does the child reply? BUT I WANT!!! Okay. Congratulations! That doesnt mean its good for you.Again as Ive said from the secular perspective there is nothing wrong with contraception.  You are trying to equate this to childishness when really there is no comparison.  The logic of secular reasoning goes like this  I like sex.  Contraception allows me to have more sex.  Contraception is not bad.  Therefore I am going to use contraception.This is already reasoning above what a toddler uses.  A toddler does not consider the morality of their wants.I used literally the same thought process to buy a fancy cast iron pan the other day.  I like food and cast irons and my spending this money so I bought it.  You seemed chained to the idea that every moral heuristic views contraception as evil when that just aint so.  I mean repeating this almost seems benign.  Its not that shocking that we think there should be freedom to choose nonharmful things.  Contraception to me is the equivalent of taking an antihistamine Why shouldnt you if you dont want to?  It isnt acting like a toddler to say you want something and then take it if youve thought it through.This logic is really genius though.  Its a great Catholic talking point because the instinctive nature of someone through social conditioning is to say But Im not selfish! which puts the fight on your terms.  I realized long ago that its a trap and there is nothing wrong with being selfish in benign desires.  I want cream in my coffee.  I also want contraception.  Unfortunately for you these are morally equivalent to me.Your uneasiness with contraception doesnt mean Im irrationally choosing something because I want it.,Catholicism,dbj18cu,1,t5_2qi4f

They contradict the honor respect and loving fear that we owe to God alone.CCC  All practices of magic or sorcery by which one attempts to tame occult powers so as to place them at ones service and have a supernatural power over otherseven if this were for the sake of restoring their healthare gravely contrary to the virtue of religion. These practices are even more to be condemned when accompanied by the intention of harming someone or when they have recourse to the intervention of demons. Wearing charms is also reprehensible. Spiritism often implies divination or magical practices the Church for her part warns the faithful against it.

Its somewhat inspired by recent venting from a good female friend who has been going on dates with a nice guy whos a bit of a dud. Be confident be intentional and be honest. You like her right? Dont be afraid to show it! She likes you too at least enough to go on a date so dont act like shes bestowing some kind of pity favor on you by agreeing to a date. Have fun! Have a plan. Sounds like youre working on this step so good start! Dont ask her out and then say What do you want to do? If youre going to dinner pick a restaurant or two and ask if she has a preference. Suggest a time but allow her to weigh in. Take the lead but be flexible.   Communicate. If you asked her out two weeks ago and havent talked to her since but the date is tomorrow night you darn well better touch base tomorrow to make sure youre still on! Make sure youre both on the same page as far as wherewhatwhenhow this date is happening. Nothings gonna kill her excitement faster than feeling like shes getting the cold shoulder.   Be yourself. Enjoy your time use this chance to ask more about her and get her to talk about herself. Show that youre interested! Sure share some of your own stories but be engaged in the conversation.   Pick up the stinkin bill. My friend told me her dud took her to a decent restaurant and they had a bottle of wine with dinner. When the server asked One check or two? the guy looked at her for confirmation. HUGE nono. Buy her mealdrinksentertainmentwhatever.  I realize a lot of this mainly applies to the first date but I think its also good stuff to keep in mind for a relationship overall even paying for dinner heh. The other advice about prayer is good but God already gave you the best tool you need a brain! Use it! Keep God the focus in your relationship and the rest will follow.

10215693,0,t1_dc1yext,gt I think its a very selfish way to look at things when someone says the babys life was short but it brought so much goodness. Maybe for the people who are living but what about for the baby that suffered and died.I have mixed feelings about this. For one thing Im unsure why the father just didnt kill the baby if he believed that would have been easier and better for the child. Sure he would have gone to jail but  presuming a jury would convict him  which father wouldnt go to jail for his child especially a suffering one? Would you not steal food so your hungry child could eat even if jail were certain? If you were convinced that killing your child were a moral or morally neutral choice why would you not do that? Im not encouraging abortion or infanticide Im just pointing out that this man is not really okay killing these children he just wanted someone else to make it better. This is understandable but it strikes me as escapism.I do not say this to trivialize the fathers suffering. Obviously he wants to not deal with this situation. Who would?I think perhaps youre confused because you may think I believe that more good comes out of this situation than bad. This is not the case. This universe is broken and nothing man can do can fix it. This mans story is a clear example. Even killing the child in utero would not fix the fact that the universe was broken enough to allow this to happen. Certainly you must agree with that statement?If humans cannot fix this universe and we really cant  the universe will die one way or another and humanity along with it then what hope do we have? Theres two choices here despair or blind faith. Atheism offers the former Catholicism and religion offer the latter.In conclusion I dont think any greater good came from this. That would trivialize the death of this child. Death is immeasurably unjust and yet I think we can learn from this. We can learn about the nature of life and that immeasurably small as it is is still an important lesson and the lesson is good. The other good is that this father can now empathize better with other men and women who have also faced infant loss.You probably think Im blowing through my hat but I do implore you to at least realize that I speak genuinely. In our own experience we have been told a few times now that our children although currently alive will likely die in utero. The waiting for miscarriage after you are told that your child is probably going to die is immeasurably awful and I wouldnt wish it on anyone. Of course doctors frequently offer you the option to abort immediately with no hassle. It all seems so easy that  as time has gone on  I sometimes find the thought passing through my mind to go along with them to just make it all stop. However we know that we cannot choose the easy option life and death are simply things that are part of this universe and as a creature with no real power over my own life other than the trivialities of what I do each day my job family etc theres nothing I can ultimately do other than simply experience it and trust that itll take me to God.gt  Contraception will alleviate a lot of these issues combined with prepregnancy genomic testing in the not too distant future.Hmm.. A very noble thought but one simply not supported by data. The Guttmacher institute prochoice planned parenthood spinof issued a study pointing out that fetal abnormality is not a significant contributor to the number of later abortions. I quotegt Most women seeking later abortion fit at least one of five profiles They were raising children alone were depressed or using illicit substances were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence had trouble deciding and then had access problems or were young and nulliparous.Secondly a huge portion of these issues are ones that occur during childbirth. Accidents during childbirth can disable a child for life. Is that really reason to kill them? It just strikes me as so inhuman to support although Im sure the thought has arisen in the minds of many a parent of a disabled child. Perhaps you disagree.Also I think we should want these issues to be completely eliminated not just a lot of them. Ultimately even if we were to go along with these immoral answers for the couples who actually ended up experiencing the birth and subsequent death of a disabled child your solution wouldnt seem like much of a solution at all  on an individual basis the efficacy of your treatments are either  or . Reducing suffering is a noble thing but none of your solutions get rid of it entirely and yet the entire belief system is based in the idea that eliminating suffering is the ultimate end goal. Surely you can see youre playing a losing battle? So ultimately Id like you to actually tell me what you think I an unequivocally prolife Catholic should support. Should I support contraception abortion and prebirth genetic testing and accept the fact that it will never catch every single case? If I shouldnt offer the Church to those who will invariably be affected by suffering related to pregnancy and childbirth then what should I? An empty promise that medicine will work for them or should have worked for them with . certainty? As someone who has been promised treatments with that efficacy only to see them fail these sorts of statistics just make me feel even worse  if your treatment is  effective then why am I in the unlucky ? Is it something I did? Luckily the Church has a consistent world view that utilitarian medicine simply cannot offer.EDIT To be clear I think comforting someone who is grieving with the thought that something good is coming out of this is awful advice. When someone is grieving the best thing to do as an outsider is to simply be there and let them feel all their feelings. This is what the family failed to do in their blind dogmatism. Ultimately I think those with a Catholic perspective ultimately come to see the good that came out of their experience. The griever is the only person who should determine what good came out of this. I think other people imposing their own beliefs on the good things that came out of anothers misfortune is extremely meanspirited.  ,Catholicism,dc208v4,10,t5_2qi4f

10223714,0,t1_dc2tsxy,How could it not be promoting his delusion...? Its precisely whats implied as you know his exact intention. Call me Francis because Im Pope. The proper response would be No you are not Pope and since you want me to call you that because you think you are Pope I will not call you that. The only reason it matters less in his case is because no one would actually believe that he is pope. It has no cultural implication attached to it. People do believe the man to woman transition making it that much more harmful to society at large. The same rule can be applied to any naming. Call me Tyrone now because Im actually black. Or call me Donald now because Im the real Donald Trump and that person is an imposter. You are buying into the persons lie by playing his game. Youre stuck in a metaphysical attachment to a name that entirely misses the point being made. In the case of calling Francis Joe his birth name which is still by most conventions his name if you claimed it was his legal name you would be saying something untrue so I would recommend someone like a judge or police officer or government worker to use his legal name in the line of duty because the implication in that context is in reference to the law you are not promoting something untrue that has anything untrue beyond the name itself. In other words it says nothing untrue about the metaphysical or whatever reality he is claiming. Hes not actually Pope. In the same way the person is not actually a woman. Both of these two things are implied by using the takenon name in place of his original name. Moreover since a name is entirely dependent upon the convention and willingness of people to recognize it as valid the law is supposed to follow this it doesnt precede it it can be denied as that convention regardless of the law. The context of the calling is what matters in the implication. If Im your friend and I call you Lucky because thats your nickname I wouldnt be implying anything untrue about your birth name or legal name or even who or what you are. Im not intending nor am I sharing in your intention nor is it implied by the convention to say anything metaphysically or otherwise untrue about you. On the other hand if you request I call you Sally because you believe you are a woman I know the intention and what would be implied by the calling. It would be the direct promotion of something untrue by both the intention and the implication. These name changes are done as an attempt to change the underlying metaphysical reality as language is incredibly powerful at changing how we approach philosophy. It normalizes the philosophical abnormal by making the language and title commonplace. Its a classic strategy employed by anyone seeking a cultural or political change. ,Catholicism,dc2wyim,2,t5_2qi4f

Law and reality often travel on different paths. A sailor lost at sea can be declared legally dead when he is in fact living a happy life on a tropical island.

10251959,0,t3_5mt1ot,They dont line up with the rest of Scripture because if you have them and go Sola Scriptura you have to be Catholic basically. For example if you allow Maccabees you have to allow praying for the dead and therefore purgatory.The detailed answer has to do with Jews and things. At the time of Christ the main Scriptures used by the Jews was the Septuagint  but after the destruction of the Temple the remaining nonCatholic Jews decided to stop using the Greek translation because the annoying Catholics kept proving their Christ was the Messiah using it so they wanted another that wouldnt have that hassle. Probably incorrect in some details. Luther wanted to use this version of Scripture instead of the Septuagint because if youre going sola you gotta have good words the best words whereas the Church has never really cared that much because the precise words are less important than the interpretation which the Church is competent to do.The Church however didnt lock down the Bible until much later though pretty quickly everyone had an agreement about what it was. One thing to note for example is that whenever the Bible itself talks about Scripture its referring mainly to the Old Testament as the New Testament hadnt been collected as such.Note that this isnt to crap all over Luther by the way. Jerome had some doubts about some of the books too but trusted the Church. And even Luther didnt leave them out  he just put them at the end and it wasnt until much later that they were cut off entirely to save printing costs.Some of the Orthodox Churches have more books than even the Catholics they were considered but finally left aside because they didnt contain anything not found in the other books.Note that the term canonical refers to the Canon of the Mass the Church when defining the Bible was defining which books could be read inside the celebration of the Mass and thereby must be correct holy etc. ,Catholicism,dc646il,7,t5_2qi4f

10263886,0,t3_5mxmbc,In my opinion she misses the point. It seemed to me that the apostasy that the priest makes is done for a few reasons. First the Japanese that are being tortured until the priest apostatizes already apostatized so they were in sin most likely aka dying for them would also mean their damnation probably. Second the film emphasizes that Christ works through this mistake and shows how the short term pain of martyrdom was very small in terms of living under the pain of being an apostate. Lastly I would say that it was a very difficult thing to see a priest have his own love used against him the love for his people that he came to save. It shows the priests heart in a distorted way. Obviously he probably should have been a martyr and this kind of plays into the idea that suffering more is somehow more meritorious aka Kant. But regardless the movie shows how unhappy he was after being an apostate which is a major part of what I think was being conveyed and how he still clung to his belief which is presented in a beautiful moment when he confronts the actual judas character Kichijiro.I wrote my own review about it too.,Catholicism,dc7gu3c,2,t5_2qi4f

10271665,0,t1_dc8astf,I am a woman.I am not saying things were perfect in bygone times but I am saying that they were exponentially better.Women today are FAR MORE EXPLOITED than they were under the socalled Patriarchy.  Women are treated like sexual objects far more...this is the result of socalled liberation and modernism.    Not only do men exploit women women have abandoned their own sense of selfworth and exploit themselves.  Additionally research shows that women are actually less happy under the current societal system than they were forty years ago under a much more socalled patriarchal system.  ltExample a woman being tied to a mangt  ...that is called being married and it is a twoway street.  It is frankly not a bad thing.I am not saying women shouldnt work outside of the home at all.  But I am saying that when you get down to it there are ultimately only two ways to run a society  paterfamilias  Statism.Under a paterfamilia the fathers form the heads of households and are mostly involved in the political life of the state.  Men take responsibility for their families and divorce is rare.  This protects women and children from lives of crime and poverty since we all know now that singlemotherhood is the greatest predictor of crime and poverty out there.If you do not have strong fathers at the helm of families what are you left with?  Women with children who MUST work outside of the home    they do not have a choice  and who therefore will likely place their children in State institutions for childcare receiving substandard and impersonal care.This causing significant attachment disorders and abandonment issues in children it traumatizes them leaving the children poor and illequipped to become productive and resilient citizens of the next generation themselves.Either the State raises your child or YOU do.

Abortion as I mentioned is an example of man twisting free will to an illogical end and well into the nose of the unborn child.And I think youd agree that the ways in which a liberal society is authoritarian is not equivalent to a capitalA Authoritarian state.So how do you replace D.C. with family?

I had never strayed from the Church or anything like that but I was also not really ever involved. Outside of attending Catholic school and going to mass on weekends I did not really engage my faith. About  and a half years ago I became very sick very suddenly. I do not want to give too many details because it can be considered too much information but I was having severe diarrhea every  minutes that eventually became just straight up blood with the absolute most severe abdominal pain I could possibly imagine. If I had to describe the pain I would say it was like someone cutting holes in my stomach and pulling my insides out. They admitted me and my first night there was the worst. I really truly thought I was dying. Around  in the morning I asked my dad to bring me one of my rosaries off the dresser at home. He brought it to me and I just laid there silently praying the rosary and when I finished I was just reading some books of the Bible. During the time I was praying the rosary and reading I had no pain. Those would be my longest periods without having to use the restroom. I felt so much peace during those moments and strength. I cried afterwards and it was the most intense relief. I found out that night that I had gotten E.Coli  most likely I got it from petting animals at the county fair a few days earlier and then not washing my hands immediately after because I do not eat meat. I really felt like after that experience that God was with me and that I was being comforted in those moments. Like I said those were the only times I had no pain. Since that experience I have become so strong in the faith I read all the books I can listen to Catholic radio my prayer life is improved and I really appreciate the mass the Church especially so much more now.

The most progressive wings of the Church and theologians were already teaching that it was licit while Pope Paul was silent. Indeed he was studying the subject he ordered a commission to evaluate it and was certainly praying much and meditating on the subject. Long story short many expected a reversal of Church teaching it was just in the air and Pope Paul didnt give any strong indication that he would go against the progressive opinion  he was reckoned by some as somewhat progressive himself. But Pope Paul surprised all by reaffirming the ban shocking all expectations and that is how Humanae Vitae came about. He faced many opposition on account of that.  ,Catholicism,dcmnj41,2,t5_2qi4f

However some are getting disillusioned considering how his war on drugs is turning up innocent victims in the crossfire or at least inspiring vigilantes to crop up.As for Catholics he has challenged the Church here before I think during the election telling how he was molested as a child but then seemed to retract his statement when the priests told him to name names. Hes... very inconsistent. Hes met with priests and has been cordial to them and then he releases statements like this. So personally Im wary but hes done nothing yet but spout words. I hope he just spouts words. The Church has offered prayers that the government leaders may be guided specially how a death penalty law is in the legislatory bodies but Im not sure if people are afraid.

10428213,0,t3_5pc6aq,Heres the thing.  Heres the question that I cannot understand a Satanists response toIf you truly believe what you believe about Satan and about Satanism you therefore have to believe at minimum in God the Father and to its full conclusion the Trinity and Christ and the Catholic Church.  And so at this point you must understand that you have chosen the side of evil.  And more than that you must understand that you have chosen the weaker side and a side that will ultimately lose not only at the end of time but at the end of your time.  So why are you staying on that side?I can think of several answers. They do not believe they could be forgiven by God.  They think they are already lost to Heaven so their only chance at a tolerable eternity is to please Satan.. It is the same as addicts despite knowing the logical consequences.  Despite seeing it in their lives and knowing that they are destroying themselves they cannot stop because it gives them the momentary relief or high  or they think it will.  So its a mental health and emotional health and social connection problem at its core.. They have become convinced of the lie that God is not more powerful and that the Devil has true power against God.. They dont really believe in any of it.So to number one the answer is to help them see the Mercy of God.  To number two proper psychological treatment and love are the answers.  To number three I think youre in go to a priest territory maybe.  And number four well maybe you can get them into something else edgy to satisfy the need to shock others.,Catholicism,dcq3uni,3,t5_2qi4f

A sweeping encyclical whose body is so comprehensive that it is impossible to be in compliance with it when interpreted in the maximalist sense and be living in general society. The value of which is summed in the opening I wish to address every person living on this planet. specifically In this Encyclical I would like to enter into dialogue with all people about our common home.Perhaps you adhere to a maximalist interpretation of LAUDATO SI in which man may cause  environmental impact during our stay on this Earth. The Pope does allude to that end when speaking of biodiversity. I would note that that end is quite impossible from the scientific standpoint. The question about the human impact on the environment is not if? it is how much?. And since NeoMalthusianism is openly rejected as error in the encyclical and the question is how much it does become subjective. Therefore an action which has an environmental impact cannot be prima facie in defiance of LAUDATO SI unless you want to assert the Pope has commanded us to perform a physical impossibility. More reasonably interpreted LAUDATO SI calls to mind careful scientific inquiry an open dialogue and subjective moral tests mindful of the tennets of social justice for the environmental impact of mans actions. Therefore simply stipulating an action has the potential for a certain environmental impact is insufficient argument to assert violating LAUDATO SI. Clearly a more nuanced discussion is in order about potential impacts how to mitigate them and whether they constitute a just use of environmental resources is in order. A place were platitudes and emotionalism add little and serious discussion adds much. ,Catholicism,dcwb5xr,4,t5_2qi4f

We dont want to impose our vision to others also because if the government its doing forcing everyone our CHOICE to avoid abortion would be less of a choice.But that is of course false. The choice that is meaningful in a Catholic sense concerns freedom of the will not freedom from external compulsion. I am always free in the morally relevant sense to commit murder or rape. Were not talking about the state handing out traumatic brain injuries after all.Abortion just is objectively a heinous moral evil a sin which cries out to Heaven for vengeance. Its also objectively injurious to the common good which makes its abolition an urgent prerogative of the state. Maybe it is so rare in Italy that this is obscured but in America it isnt. Here something like  in  babies are aborted. Here the state in many places requires taxpayers to subsidize this practice.

Just because Vatican II is on the books at the moment does not mean it could likewise be completely tossed out by a future pope. Honestly reading the stuff on the UCCB website is disturbing to say the least. Its as if they truly believe that it doesnt matter if youre Catholic or not your worship of the socalled monotheistic God in any other religion is just as valid judging by the tone they use.Likewise I completely  agree with what youre saying about the extremely disturbing comments and other threads my socalled Catholics who really think that we should adopt suicidal culture destroying policies all while turning our backs on persecuted Christians.Anyway the point is that you are not alone,Catholicism,dd2sz8p,7,t5_2qi4f

10585091,0,t1_dd7o4jm,I think you are confused. Divorce means divorce and Jesus says to divorce and remarry is to commit adultery. This is what the Catholic Church teaches and what I have been explaining. Did you mean to ask what the Greek word rendered as sexual immorality is?  Its porneia. Note that you are speaking to Catholics not Bibleonly Protestants. We dont get our understanding of the laws concerning marriage and divorce from the Bible but from the same Church that wrote and collected and curated the Bible. Some Bibleonly Protestants render porneia as adultery leading to the verse readingAnyone who divorces his wife except for adultery and marries another commits adultery.  So the only way divorce is not adultery is through adultery?Thats has never been the Catholic understanding and we know that since earliest times the Church has taught that the only marriage which may be dissolved is an invalid one. An immoral one. One conceived in immorality.  ,Catholicism,dd7rr8k,1,t5_2qi4f

10596229,0,t3_5rol2w,Didnt really expect much from Stephen Colbert but him pointing at the demiurge and the subsequent deflection by Ricky Gervais was good. But then after that he kind of failed. The Truth is that the idea of a prime mover is the only logical explanation for what came before the physicality or causality of thingsRicky probably is aware of this and since he uses his atheistic persona as a capitalistic tool he knew he must avoid that question. All of his arguments were the same tired arguments that atheists always give and it saddens me that they are that intellectually bankrupt. At least he gave the examplealthough somewhat arrogantthat religious texts wouldnt come back exactly as they were if they were destroyed. What this avoids is that these religious texts are primarily the examination of the soul and therefore are more abstract in design and would not need to be word by word copies of each other. ,Catholicism,dd8x3zt,1,t5_2qi4f

10663463,0,t1_ddfk41k,We are called to love our neighbor as ourselves.  But sometimes it is hard to love our own self.  There are some practical things you can do that help with this... here are two that I know of.One you can allow God to love you  for discussion of this see Time For God Jacques Philippe which Im not going to copypaste here.  This is hard to do at first but it will be easier with practice.  I would recommend this to anyone since were also supposed to love our neighbor as God has loved us with the same love so it is useful to get some experience in well how does God love us?Two you can work your way up to it by starting with someone you find easy to love praying for them with feelings of love and then continuing with yourself once you have some momentum.  This is primarily a way to work yourself up to praying for an enemy if you want to read original sources and if reading some Buddhist stuff would not be confusing to you see  starting at May I be well happy and peaceful for how a Buddhist would do this but keep firmly in mind that we would be not merely wellwishing but petitioning God for these things.  The same page farther down also has an interesting whollyempirical explanation of why one ought to love ones enemies and why this is better for you even from the standpoint of enlightened selfinterest than hating them.  For simplicity have some set of petitions that you are making thats going to be the same for everyone like logicallly you want everyone to know God and become holy and be free from hatred and so on.  Start with yourself then proceed to parents teachers relatives friends indifferent persons people you dont care about one way or another enemies and everyone.  This is meant to be in order of increasing difficulty so do it in a way that makes sense to you e.g. if your parents are your enemies dont start with them move them toward the end.  If you have trouble starting with yourself then change up the ordering so that youre second or third in the lineup as I said earlier.

This is a far different image than thinking she or God for that matter is some sort of mere wish granter.

If you insert the key and push the button the charges will go off and the building will collapse. You ask your crew Is everyone out of the building? They look around and notice Bill is not with them. They answer I dont know.Do you drop the building anyways not knowing if Bill is in there or do you delay and ensure the building is empty?You answer about abortion tells me you would drop the building anyways because not taking an action because you are not sure is a bit overzealous.The Church would teach that we cannot drop the building until we are sure it is clear of people.

Of course some random person on the internet would have a better grasping of God then dozens of Catholic theologians writing over the past two millennia. Your presumption of cowardice is ignorant. You presume that God being incomprehensible amounts to a total inability to know anything about God except for possibly what He directly tells us. Furthermore you havent even attempted to grasp what God is simple means. It doesnt mean simpleminded it doesnt mean small. It means lacking components which you should be able to grasp if you actually read the entirety of the link I posted several message back. God is Existence God is Justice God is Mercy etc. gt And really we only know what God is because He told us. We assume he is Good because He told us he is. But He could also be evil or neutral and still tell us He is good. God reveals certain things to us and we can also determine what He cannot be. If He were evil He wouldnt be God being  goodness evil is a privatization of Good not its own thing. gt If that were true then no one would have a biological desire for sex until after marriage. Because to have it before is where Lust is and that could not exist without the fall. Or the idea that premarital sex is a sin is wrong. If you version were true man would have been made to sin which is a theological contradiction. Man was made to be good and it is only through the Fall that we sinned did evil. Dont confuse inclination and desire with action and dont confuse a biological impulse with a sinful inclination. Just as being hungry isnt the same as having an inclination towards gluttony having a desire toward reproduction is not the same as having an inclination towards lustful fornication. ,Catholicism,ddm7am7,1,t5_2qi4f

Heres why I came to the Catholic Church Its the Church that Jesus Christ instituted himself. For over  years it was the entirety of Christianity.  It wasnt until the Protestant Reformation that Christianity changed.  There was the EastWest Schism in the th century I believe but the issue there was who should be the next pope rather than the Protestant rejection of the Church doctrine. Other Protestant denominations tend to focus only on what fits their beliefs rather than adjusting their beliefs to fit the Churchs teaching.In other words people didnt like the Catholic Churchs teachings so they invented their own religion.  It kind of seems like a cheap way out to me.  Also Mass actually feels like true worship to me.  The evangelical crowd of the Bible Belt of the southeastern US uses pure lecture and passionate speech which seems like more of a dialogue between men than a true encounter with the Lord.This is purely my opinion based on observations made both in my atheist life and my recent Catholic life.

10775320,0,t3_5u4wb1,Moral relativism is fatally flawed.  In almost all cases it is derived from a sense of universal morality that one persons morality should never be imposed upon others.  However this defeats itself realizing this one must accept that there is a universal morality.  Once accepting that morality is universal the discussion becomes about the nature of that universal morality.The only cohesive logic supporting a relative morality is that there is actually no morality at all so its all just whatever we kind of agree upon but we can change it or abandon it entirely.  That does seem to be where your friends are arguing from but if they can agree that even one thing is universally immoral their entire construct is defeated.  Have you tried more shocking examples such as the morality or immorality of raping a three year old?To follow on from that example as they will find a way to explain it away as efficient or beneficial to prevent such things heres an idea of where to go next.  If killing for population control is acceptable or whatever reason they say it could be acceptable to kill the three year old once a child or any person has been marked for death these rules of benefit and efficiency should have no bearing.  If a three year old is to be killed for whatever socially efficient reason is it not logical to conclude that between marking for death and killing the child anything done to the child has no societal consequences.  So in that construct it could not be immoral to rape a child or man or woman marked for death as theyve already been de facto extinguished from society.

That being said there are exceptions such as acts that help arouse either spouse to facilitate intercourse. But of course certain other acts are just plain sinful such as sodomy. The Church isnt trying to police the bedroom but is trying to make sure we are guided by love and not lust. Certain sexual acts are simply lustful and objectify the spouse for the benefit of the other. Believe me it is a complicated topic and one my wife and I have to reexamine often as relative newlyweds.

I do at least some prayer every day and I try to do some reading every day more or less I succeed.  Ive done Novenas and the like and those are helpful I think.  I havent done one in a while and Im behind in planning for this Lent.  When I fail to improve these aspects I try to keep these words of St. Francis De Sales to mindfrom   Read the Introduction to the Devout Life!One of the best exercises of meekness we can perform is that the object of which is within ourselves in never fretting at our own imperfections for though reason requires that we should be sorry when we commit any fault yet we must refrain from that bitter gloomy spiteful and passionate displeasure for which many are greatly to blame who being overcome by anger are angry for having been angry and vexed to see themselves vexed for by this means they keep their heart perpetually steeped in passion and though it seems as if the second anger destroyed the first it serves nevertheless to open a passage for fresh anger on the first occasion that shall present itself. Besides this anger and vexation against ourselves tend to pride and flow from no other source than selflove which is troubled and disquieted to see itself imperfect. We must be displeased at our faults but in a peaceable settled and firm manner for as a judge punishes malefactors much more justly when he is guided in his decisions by reason and proceeds with the spirit of tranquillity than when he acts with violence and passion . . . so we correct ourselves much better by a calm and steady repentance than by one that is harsh turbulent and passionate for repentance exercised with violence proceeds not according to the quality of our faults but according to our inclinations....Try not to be too hard on yourself for failing in improving your prayer life.  It doesnt help.  What helps is praying.  Say little prayers and commit to do better.  Little prayers like The Jesus Prayer are good in this regard.

10861688,0,t3_5v9h2j,This might not be the answer you want to hear  but deliberately pursuing actions that cause stimulation should probably be avoided. Chastity encompasses a heck a lot more than just abstinence its slapping lust away every time it tries to tempt you not inviting it in and then just telling it to stay away from the bedroom. So how does one establish an intimacy without physical stimulation? Theres plenty of ways to grow closer together as a couple without it pray together share hobbies together share your fearsworries spend time with family together. And I know I know you stated that physical intimacy is a crucial aspect in your relationship but I will tell you right now  youre not the only ones. But I will also tell you this. Giving up immoral physical intimacy is hard. Really hard. But carrying my cross together  handinhand with my fianc has brought us closer to each other and to God than when we had scoffed at the idea of chastity. . One should not give themselves completely to someone who is not their spouse. Striving for chastity helps accomplish that  its great that you guys know you want to get married to each other. But its also crucial to remember that a marriage is spiritually and emotionally distinct from dating. So no we dont have a set of comprehensive rules of things you cancant do with obviously anything that has to do with nudity or genitals are probably not okay. Choosing God or your girlfriend isnt mutually exclusive  in fact if you place God in the center of the relationship it will flourish. My fianc and I have gone through every stage of trying to be chaste so believe me I feel your struggle.

10869485,0,t3_5va2hf,Good insight.  Heres what the catechism says about the psalmsThe Psalms the prayer of the assembly From the time of David to the coming of the Messiah texts appearing in these sacred books show a deepening in prayer for oneself and in prayer for others. Thus the psalms were gradually collected into the five books of the Psalter or Praises the masterwork of prayer in the Old Testament. The Psalms both nourished and expressed the prayer of the People of God gathered during the great feasts at Jerusalem and each Sabbath in the synagogues. Their prayer is inseparably personal and communal it concerns both those who are praying and all men. The Psalms arose from the communities of the Holy Land and the Diaspora but embrace all creation. Their prayer recalls the saving events of the past yet extends into the future even to the end of history it commemorates the promises God has already kept and awaits the Messiah who will fulfill them definitively. Prayed by Christ and fulfilled in him the Psalms remain essential to the prayer of the Church. The Psalter is the book in which The Word of God becomes mans prayer. In other books of the Old Testament the words proclaim Gods works and bring to light the mystery they contain. The words of the Psalmist sung for God both express and acclaim the Lords saving works the same Spirit inspires both Gods work and mans response. Christ will unite the two. In him the psalms continue to teach us how to pray. The Psalters many forms of prayer take shape both in the liturgy of the Temple and in the human heart. Whether hymns or prayers of lamentation or thanksgiving whether individual or communal whether royal chants songs of pilgrimage or wisdom meditations the Psalms are a mirror of Gods marvelous deeds in the history of his people as well as reflections of the human experiences of the Psalmist. Though a given psalm may reflect an event of the past it still possesses such direct simplicity that it can be prayed in truth by men of all times and conditions. Certain constant characteristics appear throughout the Psalms simplicity and spontaneity of prayer the desire for God himself through and with all that is good in his creation the distraught situation of the believer who in his preferential love for the Lord is exposed to a host of enemies and temptations but who waits upon what the faithful God will do in the certitude of his love and in submission to his will. The prayer of the psalms is always sustained by praise that is why the title of this collection as handed down to us is so fitting The Praises. Collected for the assemblys worship the Psalter both sounds the call to prayer and sings the response to that call HalleluYah! Alleluia Praise the Lord! ,Catholicism,de13yx3,2,t5_2qi4f

He said that daily confession is a commendable practice recommended by many good spiritual writers which is correct and he also objected that onceamonth confession is not often enough to earn indulgences throughout the month because you have to make a confession within several days which indeed means about  However he has overlooked that the confession can be made about twenty days before or after the indulgenced work so that onceamonth confessions would indeed cover each entire month.I would not think it was unhealthy if someone were devoted enough to indulgences that gift of God to the Church to make a separate confession for each indulgence although it would be supererogatory.,Catholicism,de1jn8b,1,t5_2qi4f

Over the last decades so many many things in the Church which would have been considered unchangeable have in fact changed. The method is usually the same  Just start doing the thing. Require your priests to go along with it. Eventually the people come to depend on it then if Rome objects appeal to the sensibilities of the people who want the change.In  years no one will remember Amoris but in virtually all dioceses people committing adultery will be receiving communion with a clear conscience. Homosexual couples will see the illogic of it all and demand communion and that will be granted as well.

10903974,0,t1_de4c2mx,gt When you approached the the Church for marriage she would not marry you if you didnt meet the requirements for validity. So the instances of invalid marriages were very low back then.Perhaps by the standards of the day but I imagine quite a lot would have been invalid by todays standards. Was annulment even possible for those outside the aristocracy?You can point to the fact that the overriding question is and has always been  was the sacrament valid. But the means of answering that question of checking the necessary conditions for validity seems to have changed quite a bit. When Francis worries that possibly half of all marriages are null by todays standards it raises the issue of have practicable the process really is. gt One last thing. An annulment is a mercy of the Church. The Church is going out of its way to investigate a sacrament to ensure validity. She does not have to do this...Correct me if Im wrong but if the church grants an annulment its saying that there was no marriage i.e. theres nothing to actual annul in the usual sense of the word. And so if the person never actually sought the annulment well the marriage never existed anyway so they still wouldnt be validly married. If the church were to always assume validity of marriages it would lead to couples persisting in a state of sin as they would have continue to have sexual relations thinking they were married when in actual fact they were not. I imagine avoiding the obvious ensuing messiness is why theres the current movement towards discernment. ,Catholicism,de4o18h,0,t5_2qi4f

This is not a defense of anyone but its also unfair to paint the Catholic Church in such a bad light when it was in fact a much wider problem. You said yourself the rate of abuse by priests was not that different than the normal rate of abuse. Im curious whats the rate of cover up from back then?

Theyre full time in a seminary for a few years and then kind of set loose after being ordained to the subdiaconate to find a lady. Theres quite some pressure to find a nice lady in that period of time before ordination to the diaconate.. If hes already married where is he going to stay during seminary? Theyre not set up for that.. Basically a big culture shift for every parish that he goes to. Theyll have a lot of adjustment to make and hell have to juggle complete devotion to his wife and to his parish.Those are off of the top of my head and theyre from talking to married deacons and a couple of married priests.,Catholicism,deq4zyw,16,t5_2qi4f

It is a bad thing which we must suffer. So in Latin you use the word poenas which is almost always translated into English as punishment. But it doesnt have the type of meaning youre suggesting which is admittedly the more common use of the word in English where it implies an active punishing and punisher.

Having not read the book myself the only judgement I can make is that if this is the understanding it has given you then it is not unbiased.

We hope to have children soon and I would really want my husband to have all the options available if I were to die  for his sake and for our future childrens. Obviously the same concerns exist for the priesthood. Theres also  the issue of time. Churches are currently organized to have a few priests who commit an enormous amount of hours to the spiritual well being of parishioners. This seems like a very poor fit for married men with young families.I would have fewer hesitations if we were past childbearing age and if we had a chance to see how parishes navigated having married priests.

11133032,0,t1_detv0i8,Its not a false dichotomy. Its a real dichotomy. This is a distinction that has been known for thousands of years. There are people who dont know from practice but from being told about it. For instance Ive never seen Beethoven but I can know about him from reading about him. I can know about the atom not from experience but from being told about how it works. Contrariwise there are people who know from practice. For instance I know what it is to be a man because I am one. I know what grass is from having been around it thousands of times. Obviously there is no distinction in reality between what the thing is but if you dont know if from experience you need to rely on externalized rules. If you know it from practice you may not have thought through the explicit formulas for everything but you know it when you see it. You have good intuition for what is right and what isnt. My experience is that many people who attend the Latin Mass do so out of a love for its beauty. Many people that love hiking mountains do so because they love experiencing the beauty of nature not because they want to be geologists or biologists. Likewise many people that care deeply about the Mass love the beauty of the Mass without necessarily caring about all the rubrics. I know no one else that knows the various rubrics of the EF Latin Mass but I know many people that attend the EF Latin Mass. Many people who are beset by the many abuses that tend to go along with the NO know the rubrics because they see their abuse. They know the law from reading not from practice.

We ought to be terrified of hell but even more so we ought to come to realize how thoroughly God hates sin and come to hate it ourselves. Hating sin is a great first step on the road out of it especially with a torturous sin such as masturbation. Following that bolster yourself against it with prayer. Whenever you have a foul thought turn to prayer maybe Jesus Christ Gods Son have mercy on me a sinner. Repeat it until the urge passes let it wash over and eradicate the sinful thoughts. Get it into your head that God is always near and He witnesses our most shameful acts and knows the state of our mind. We so often do before God the one deserving of more respect and love than any other what we would not dare to do before any other person.Remember too that God is allmerciful and He will always forgive us so long as we are truly and completely contrite regardless of how grievous our sins are. Recall Saint Paul and his sins.Once you are baptized and able to attend Confession of course you will feel better. But until that time do not fear to the point of despair for such extreme fear is of Satan. Rather complement your healthy fear with hope in God and in His mercy.

CCC   Christ proposes the evangelical counsels in their great variety to every disciple. The perfection of charity to which all the faithful are called entails for those who freely follow the call to consecrated life the obligation of practicing chastity in celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom poverty and obedience. It is the profession of these counsels within a permanent state of life recognized by the Church that characterizes the life consecrated to God. CCC  The state of consecrated life is thus one way of experiencing a more intimate consecration rooted in Baptism and dedicated totally to God. In the consecrated life Christs faithful moved by the Holy Spirit propose to follow Christ more nearly to give themselves to God who is loved above all and pursuing the perfection of charity in the service of the Kingdom to signify and proclaim in the Church the glory of the world to come.

They were an independent Catholic organization and they would have different religious priests say the mass. The chairs were set up in a circle after the readings there was an open discussion on what the scriptures meant to everybody. Several folks promoted a Catholic protest for abortion and LGBT rightgay marriage. The homily was basically about how the religious priest had been saying mass with this community since the s and how he thought they were such a wonderful open community.

And if I can love both men and women although I only love my girlfriend of course then isnt it that God intended it that way? That its possible to love men too? Im also really having difficulty understanding why its a sin. Hi! Unfortunately love has often been associated with romantic love and romantic love with sexual love. This is just a small subset of what love truly is. We are invited to love everyone with everything we have but not always called to join in sexual love with each other.We are all created out of the pure love of God flowing out from him in the creative act. God created you not just for being average or normal but to sainthood to greatness and to love and live as much as you possibly can. St. Ireneaus once wrote that The Glory of God is a human being fully alive. God created you out of love and for love. God allowed you to be bisexual because it allowed him to make you as great as you can. His plan may be mysterious but he indeed wants the very best for us and this requires chastity love and respect for your body and for others so we can be what we always were designed to be a human being fully alive. Now this may be hard to understand but pray to God for help. He is there to guide you.

11311191,0,t1_dfe3h2f,Im not saying a man has to be sinless to become a priest. That is a false caricature of my comment. However my opinion is that certain sins should not be common place when you are a priest. I think this is also true of being a married man. This is because pornography addiction can absolutely destroy those vocations and it is my opinion that it is selfish to go into either of them thinking it wont eventually affect your flock or your spousefamily. Think of a seminarian that held kelptomaniac problems. He just loved the thrill of theft from time to time. Is that someone youd want running your church? No one would have a problem with saying that he shouldnt be running a Church yet but suddenly with pornography despite knowing how evil it is it isnt an issue to be concerned about?The real issue? As if porn addiction wasnt a real one? But yes  I think the larger problem here is the failure to confess. I find that hugely problematic.

11346872,0,t1_dfi3j11,Thank you for that Ive enjoyed this conversation as well. My wife is a nonbeliever so Ive got a bit of experience talking about this particular line of thought. From that experience let me also tell you that youre not going to find all the answers youre looking for right away. I only ask that you keep the same open mind youve had throughout all of this for however long it takes you to find those answers. To quote past comments use the gt symbol.I appreciate your perspective on belief as a choice or not as the case may be. I think of belief as sort of an optin. We can choose not to believe in things for which there is a preponderance of evidence but not concrete evidence. This is basically what politics is. Insert laughter here. Ultimately belief is limited to things you cant prove or at least cant prove completely. I dont need to believe in my computer. I know that it exists. I dont have to believe in March th I know that it exists or existed depending on your time zone. But for God our proofs and evidence extend only so far by virtue of Gods immeasurable and unquantifiable pretty sure I just made up that word nature. Belief fills in the rest. You have to choose to believe or not believe in things you cant fully comprehend. Im a musician. When I hear scientists talk about climate change I tend to believe them. I dont know enough of the science though admittedly I could eventually learn it given enough time and money and dedication to form a conclusion on my own. Instead I choose to believe that it is real because there is enough evidence available to me even if it isnt fully asserted to or understood by me.gtAnd as someone that does not believe a God exists I dont believe in a hell either. So I really have to disagree with you on the point you made that a lack of belief in God is the choice to spend eternity in Hell do you see what I mean?I do. I was trying to make a similar point actually though my writing was a bit clumsy. My point was that if you choose to reject God you choose to accept hell. Obviously for this choice to be valid in these terms you have to believe in both. If you dont believe in God because you havent been presented with a strong enough case yet despite openly and actively searching for one that is entirely different from choosing not to believe.gtIf I was in hell and God had a delete button and I begged him to press it would it really be love if he chose not to?In this scenario God has already given you what you asked for  to be separated from Him. The suffering you may experience there is what you chose see above.  Thats why it isnt God sentencing His loved ones to eternal torture. He loves themus enough to let us choose that.Going back to our hypothetical daughter lets say we have a falling out. Some big fight over that loser boyfriend shes dating or her deciding to skip college and sell artisan soaps out of her van or something. Whatever it is she decides as an adult that she doesnt want anything to do with me ever again. She changes her phone number blocks me from her social media accounts doesnt leave a forwarding address and skips town. I have two choices. I can either hunt her down and try to make her to come back thus negating her choice or I can let her go and have what she wants. Out of love I have to choose the latter even if it would break my heart.gtWell what if the person wants to die? Is he not violating their free will by continuing to have them tortured instead?Hell is a weird concept to grasp. We tend to think of fire and brimstone and all that because its the closest thing our human brains can conceive of when it comes to agony. As I said in another reply we dont know if these physical sorts of torment are literal or figurative. What we do know is that the ultimate agony there is spending eternity in a place removed from love or happiness. Thats the reality we would choose in rejecting God. If the person wants to die in a sense the person already did. If God were to begin mercy killing an oxymoron that the Church opposes the souls in hell it would radically upend our notions of what God is.I suspect for now that you and I wont agree on this as you said. I dont claim to possess all knowledge and I certainly wont speak for the Church no less for God. Youve been a great sport to come and have an open and friendly discussion. Thats all anybody could ask for. Thank you so much for that.gtId also briefly like to hear your reply on this theres over  religions in this world why is yours the one true religion?Im not sure theres a brief answer to this one. The Church teaches that many religions have incomplete claims to the Truth. This is because in the same way that children want to know their parents we as humans want to know our Creator. And so religions and philosophies spring up to try to get to know Him. In their explanations they sometimes come upon bits of Truth and the Church doesnt deny that. Briefly put or as brief as I possibly can God chose to reveal Himself to the Jewish people. He did so gradually in ways big and small. He made promises which we call covenants with them delivered them from their bondage in Egypt led them through the wilderness into the Promised Land and even when they turned away from Him He came to their aid when they repented. The question is why gradually? Why not just drop a Truth bomb and be done with it?Gods reasons are His own but I personally think its because humanity had and has some growing up to do. A violent nomadic people living in a hostile land were going to have a difficult time digesting God is love. So over time they came to know Him. In the same way that children as infants dont suddenly come to know their parents. It happens gradually and most importantly it never stops. I know more about my mom now than I did when I was  which was more than I knew at  or  or . And I suspect Ill know more as I continue to get older as well. Similarly as we seek to know God our understanding of Him grows with age. For the Jewish people they had to start somewhere and grow.He sent prophets to them telling them that in time a figure would come to save them from basically the world but also themselves. This figure they came to call the Messiah. They expected the Messiah to do certain things and to arrive in a certain way. The figure God sent was His own Son Jesus. He arrived in a way they were not expecting and he actually did all the things they expected but not in the way they expected. He had a band of followers  of whom were Apostles. To these he granted the authority to build a Church and to spread it far and wide. This Church is still around and youve come to visit our unofficial but still cool subreddit. Hi!Its a big claim  that we have the Truth and everybody else doesnt. Unsurprisingly most other religions have the same claim. We do have some things going for us though that lend some credence. We can get into that but I think a different thread in this sub would be a better place for that discussion. The bottom line for you or anybody else seeking the Truth is that the choice is in your hands. Not about whats True and whats not thats objective. But the choice is to seek it out openly and to believe or not.You seem like a cool and thoughtful person. I have every confidence that youll eventually find the answers youre looking for even if it doesnt happen right away. In the meantime whether it means anything to you or not Ill pray that you find what youre looking for.,Catholicism,dfi5bpr,7,t5_2qi4f

11354924,1,t1_dfiyqu2,Charged it may be but theres also an extent to which modern man and especially American modern man has lost sight of the fact that creation is inherently hierarchical and as such a human society that is conformed to the natural law will also be to some extent hierarchical. Authority to govern doesnt simply flow from the consent of the governed.In terms of understanding my own rle I keep coming back to the New Testament reading from the Nuptial Mass Ephesians  Paul starts off by talking about a wifes obligation to submit to her husbands authority but then very quickly turns to the husband and lectures him about what his authority is for to see to her wellbeing even at the expense of his own.I then look at other models of lay leadership within the Church most notably leadership within religious communities and I start understanding why there needs to be a leader as a way to make decisions affecting the entire community so that unity may be preserved.And at this point I start to form a framework for my headship within the family. My decisions always need to be made with the good of the family in mind and if anyones needs must be compromised for the sake of the rest of the family it must always be my own.. I should only exercise the fulness of my authority under limited circumstances When someone under my charge is incapable for whatever reason of making a free and informed choice of his own. Obviously this would only apply to my wife if she were somehow incapacitated  by fatigue depression etc.  or if I had information that for whatever reason I had not yet had the opportunity to share with her. When someone under my charge is committing an act that is ipso facto gravely disordered and when my intervening to stop it will not have worse effects. When the actions of someone under my charge or a disagreement among them threatens the unity and harmony of the family and cannot be otherwise resolved I must step in and resolve the situation.I appreciate what youre saying about the temptation to exploit such a position for ones own good but abusus non tollit usum. Moreover while I obviously disagree with your assertion that annihilating the husbands headship is the solution youre absolutely right about the problems that led to the whole feminist movement in the first place.

Then I realized that I was thinking about it the wrong way. Its not like here living on the Earth forever would have a host of terrible problems and youd want it to end. In heaven you dont want it to end. And it never does. Our minds cant really comprehend it and while thats initially scary we have to accept that certain things we just cant understand right now. Its like the number Infinity we know of it but we cant truly comprehend what a bottomless number is.To continue on the body point I think its Gods intention for us to have the body we were always meant to have. In heaven we are as we should be and our body is the same.  ,Catholicism,dfjjrd8,1,t5_2qi4f

For Plato a thing was only as good as how well it corresponded to the form of good for that thing. Think of a tree. We know a good tree is one that is healthy tall sprouts lots of seeds has lots of branches and so on. Aristotle would say yes thats a good tree because we know what constitutes a good tree via our intellect experiencing and observing trees. Plato would say yes thats a good tree because out there exists this invisible idea of what a tree should be this tree is very close to that and I know this innately.

11687667,0,t1_dgksyuy,Sounds like shes the one to talk to for that Parish if thats who the priest pointed you to. Its very common for priests to delegate the actual running of this ministry accepting converts to a lay person. The group notion sounds like RCIA even if she didnt call it that. RCIA doesnt entail tests or contracts. It merely a structured way for churches to catechize and induct converts to the faith. A parish could have dozens come into the church every year it would be difficult to manage all that on an individual basis!Ultimately it still sounds like you have no problem. The higherup person you spoke to gave you the normal process and how it would normally work.

11778397,0,t3_681qz2,As somebody facing the same dilemma Im learning to appreciate a lot of typically but not exclusively Orthodox approaches to theology while at the same time deepening my knowledge of what I find to be the much more historicallysound ecclesiology of Catholicism.  From what Ive seen although many Orthodox Christians scoff at the grand edifice of systematic theology erected and maintained by the RCC it is in fact Catholicism that allows for more probing inquiry not in spite of the structures in place but because of them.  We have more records kept of what people have thought and more to build upon or to scrap without fear of scrapping the essential elements.  You can be a Thomist manualist or you can be Eastern Catholic. For example I am starting to read The Philokalia.  Is that a typically Roman Catholic work to study? Probably not.  Is it contrary to Catholicism? No. On those issues you mentioned like the filioque...I often see the conversations start to deteriorate when having been confronted with the Catholic position the Orthodox will fold their arms and mutter well yes that may be so but I have to think about it and then they go back to their own and rage about the Catholics just not getting it.  Or Papal authorityit moves from denial of primacy to acceptance of primacy but not supremacy to supremacy but not without everyone in agreement...and on and on begrudgingly accepting more and more of the Catholic position following reason just a little bit at a time until it feels unsafe to go further.  I see this as a cultural peculiarity that makes it difficult to see when there is a legitimate objection or not.  And what final authority can be consulted? The Orthodox seem to approach everything with suspicion rather than probing curiosity. Their rich traditions appear to have ossified for fear of corruption by the other. As much as I believe there is the light of the Truth in their tradition it is an incomplete truth without the guidance or life of the Church and I pray that I am correct in this defense of the Catholic Church as the Church.  This truth moreover which they hold fast to appears preserved by a refusal to engage like a corpse mummified by being sealedoff from contact with the world.  And then they interpret this mummification to be evidence of incorruptibility.   ,Catholicism,dgv4a9t,7,t5_2qi4f
