119911,0,t1_cerym27,Funny I felt like the opposite on both your points.I hadnt watched trailers or anything so I didnt know anything about this game going in. When playing as Vella you start out with the really positive sister and generally people being positive but you start to kind of see theres a dark side until its outright revealed you gon be sacrificed. It was jarring for the purpose of having emotional impact. I guess one thing I can say is that it was very obvious that thats what they were doing so the writing probably could have been stronger.I played through all of Vella then all of Shay. The whole time as intended I think my suspicions were focused on the wolf rather than what the ship was doing. We cant see whos in quarantine? I bet hes setting us up for something. Are we stealing cargo? He can turn off my shields? Because my mind was focused on that line of attack I never considered that we really were rescuing people but maybe people that didnt need to be rescued. The stories felt totally disconnected to me other than the mention of Lerune in both.  I honestly didnt realize anything until they showed Shay walking out of Moggy and then I suddenly put the grabby arms together with the attack and was just like OH SHEEESH. It was a great moment. It sounds like I made the right choice by playing through one then the other.,brokenage,ces32ye,5,t5_2wpuw
3909655,0,t3_35889q,I think they tried to explain it but it was a bit of a stretch. Apparently teenage boys raised in a certain environment develop a sixth sense of sorts that allows them to choose the most genetically beneficial specimens. Mareks race was incapable of doing this themselves so they sent Shay and others like him to be raised in tightly controlled environments that would foster development of that sixth sense.,brokenage,cr1xowy,4,t5_2wpuw
