886925,0,t3_248lt6,Because theres no national organizations in the USA devoted to helping hoarders and their loved ones.  It would require a national organization to  staff run and most importantly FUND such a help line.  The little hoarding assistance thats out there is at the local level only.Also what would a National Hoarder Hotline do exactly?  Direct people to local hoarding task forces and mental health agencies?  You can get that information with Google.  Come to your house and clean?  Who would pay for that?  And how is that different from any local businesses that offer that service?Regardless the closest things that I know of are ClutterCleaner.coms Hoarder Hotline  Im not entirely sure what the Hotline offers but according to their websitegt Sometimes you just need to talk about it for a minute. The Hoarder Hotline is for families friends and Clutter Cleaner Trusted Partners that are currently helping hoarders...After helping over  families affected by hoarding the Clutter Cleaner team can help you stay focused find local resources and guide you to help the hoarder in your family. gt gt The Hoarder Hotline is NOT a psychology line and there are no therapists on staff. We are simply guys that have been working with and helping hoarders for years. We are simply here to offer advice from our years of experience. They charge  for  minutes and hour for  hour or more. Similarly SteriClean offers HOARDERS.   Per their website you can talk to a hoarding specialist at SteriClean to develop a customized plan made for your particular needs. This option is for hoarders that want to slowly clean a little at a time and cant bear to have a crew enter their homes.  Cost if halfhour or hour.  You can also use their online chat function for the same fee.,hoarding,ch53hl0,3,t5_2s9r3

1257121,0,t3_28hgnh,This is what I suggest. Open the door to your garage and say Make me an offer. People will come in hunt around and remove your stuff while paying you. At the end of the sale donate what you think you cant sell at the next sale and then you have an empty garage. Before people come decide roughly on prices eg all clothes  each all books c each unseen box . Then you have  options. Option . Move stuff from the house to the nearly empty garage and have another sale the next time you come. Dont set stuff out neatly and price stuff if you want to get rid of stuff fast.Option . Let the buyers into a room in the house and do the same thing make me an offer Youd have to specify which room if you dont want them in the whole house. Make sure mom is OK emotionally with this. You can even advertise the date of the second sale at the first sale if you can plan that far in advance. Just watch local ordinances. Where I live you are only allowed  sales in a  month period while other cities you can have a sale a week and no one cares. Keep selling one room at a time until the house is empty. To answer your original question if you were to set everything out neatly and price everything it may not be worth your time thats why I suggest the method of opening the door and letting people hunt for themselves. Assuming you want everything gone  if you dont then before the sale move what you do want to the back yard,hoarding,cib1hm9,9,t5_2s9r3

Sunlight is a natural disinfectant.   I tried to have them sort items by type as much as possible.   One tarp for tools one for clothing one for books etc.   The sorting fell apart as the piles grew but at least we got it all outside.  I was then able to sort in breathable air.

2180877,0,t1_clgfxz4,All right. So this started with you asking what we think. Ive read your replies to me and to other people and Ive noticed two things. First you talk a lot about buying things. You talk about the pleasure of buying something new. You talk about the money youve spent. You are resistant to any scenarios where you might get rid of things.Second you talk about things piling up and overflowing their storage space. You talk about letting things get out of hand like stacks of dirty dishes.I think you are a baby hoarder. It sounds like you are buying too many things and then not having any place to store them or organize them and it sounds like you cannot go through your things and get rid of stuff. It sounds like youre starting to get overwhelmed by the piles of stuff in your room which is why youre reaching out to us. I agree with SammaATL you should talk to a therapist at minimum and possibly also to a professional organizer who can help you curate your collection. If they talk like JasonGenovaa down there and are dissing the video games find a different person.

I might have some Oppositional Defiant Disorder tendencies. The harder someone tries to get me to do anything the harder I will resist on principle. My mom was also a hoarder and a narcissist she was always trying to force me to do heavy hauling and unsafe cleaning for her. I learned pretty young that not doing what was asked of me was the safer option. She made cleaning a nightmare. I know I had to want to change in order to change. No one could force me I couldnt force my mother to change either.   If youre over  in America you have the right to leave and theres no law requiring that you have to have a phone or answer it. The idea that having a life with another person was worth more then all of the objects I owned helped compel me to want to change. Your mom might be totally cool but my mom was majorly uncool in an emotionally abusive way.

4393858,0,t3_3bbvn0,Welcome to the sub.gt  would ANYONE buy a formerly nice house thats half full of cat feces half full of stuff and if so how much does that remove from property value? Fixed up the house would be worth around k in its current condition....I cant even guess.There are people who will buy homes in such condition for renovation or teardownrebuild but theyll want it for pennies on the dollar.  You need to have the place assessed by a real estate agent knowledgeable in such things if you want to sell it asis.gt  if I hire a crew to clean it out and have things fixed up to sellable condition is it even worth spending the money considering ?gt gt  is this house always going to stink to the point it will sit on the market for years unsold?gt To answer  and  you should contact a biohazard cleanup business preferably with experience in handling animal hoarders and have them comes to the house and give you an estimate do NOT accept overthephone estimatesno reliable cleanup company will give an estimate without seeing the property. Your local Humane Society or animal shelter can probably recommend an appropriate company to help you. If not check with the local police and tell them youre interested in contacting a crimescene cleanup crew.See the issue with animal hoarding cleanup is that youre dealing with actual bona fide biohazardous material animal waste. Animal hoarding cases that involve cats are among the worst due to the high crystallization of cat urine and high amounts of ammonia found in the cat urine. In addition to saturating damn near everything they peeshit on leaving most of the contents unsalvageable structural damage is usually found. Buildup of cat urine can literally destroy carpeting flooring and drywall.So special precautions have to be taken in order to remove and dispose of contaminated materials and animal waste in a safe way. Its particularly important in the case of animal hoarders because they typically dont take the best care of their pets health thus theres the risk that any diseases or viruses that the pets have picked up are likely still lingering in the animal waste thats on the property.Biohazard teams have both the training and equipment HAZMAT suits masks respirators etc. to deal with all of that and then some. Your relative doesnt sound like the typical animal hoarder so hopefully a crew can get the job done quickly. Only way to know for sure is to have them come out and assess the situation for you then give you a written estimate.Be warned a professionallydone biohazard cleanup will not be cheap. According to Animal Planet biohazard crews start at about  per hour per crew member. Your folks dont sound like the typical animal hoarders so a biohazard crew might be able to get in and out of there fairly quickly.But even after the biohazard folks are done youd still need a general contractor to come in there and take out drywall flooring etc. The ammonia in the urine soaking in for years will have done far too much damage for that stuff to remain.gt  knowing all of the above what should I do?Start by getting estimates from as many biohazard cleaners as you can.  I also suggest you read over this article about the costs to cleanup after hoarders.Im so sorry you have to deal with this. As I said before your folks dont sound like the typical animal hoarder so hopefully this wont get too expensive.,hoarding,cskx93w,4,t5_2s9r3

We moved in here when my grandfather passed away he build this house in the early s my dad grew up here and after my grandpa passed away we moved in I think I was like... or something?? but we have all the stuff my grandpa had plus all the crap that weve been accumulating throughout the years. Its very easy to build up stuff when you never move! I saw some Kup stax the cup stacking game  the other day and I was like omg I cant throw this away! but after thinking about it I realized that other than the fact that Im amazed I kept it this long once I put it back in the box Im never thinking about it ever again. Im sad to say I did put it back in the box but Im always thinking that when I find it again Im going to take it out of the box this time. My friend recently moved for about  months to England and she had to get rid of EVERYTHING except what she could put into a couple suitcases and so Ive been talking to her and this is exactly how she described it. She said it was so hard getting rid of it and a lot of the stuff she was pretty sure she would never get back again but once it was all gone she felt so light and mobile and she just felt a lot happier in her life. This is my goal as I have felt very weighed down by all my stuff. Im hoping to get into my parents things to find ALL the items from my childhood and get rid of them as well but thatll be in my own time after Ive moved out or if Im done going through my stuff and Im having a boring time and have nothing better to do. I have told my parents that in going through my stuff Id appreciate it if theyd get rid of their stuff because its a lot of work to get rid of this stuff and I think the whole family will be suffering when they pass on and itll make it more emotionally difficult for us to dispose of these things in that situation.

Somebody who can help both of you stop and step back before things get too heated. They may help him realize that he needs help with his anxiety about getting rid of thingsmovingwhatever. Either way I would look for resources even if he is reluctant. If the arguments are as heated as you just said you could both use some marriage counseling.

I think that she gets frustrated with us sees us as stupid for not trying to win at life. She doesnt really seem to believe that anyone does anything except because its good helps you win or bad a guilty pleasure. So if someone joins a gym they must be trying to lose weight. But if someone sleeps in it must be because they arent worried about anyone finding out. Youre either working or cheating. And thats what Im most worried about I dont think she has really enjoyed very much in decades. ,hoarding,deuzode,9,t5_2s9r3

Do you call Your grandma regularly? If so give her a casual call. Did you report anonymously? regardless you did the right thing and the ball is now out of your court. ,hoarding,dexlxk0,3,t5_2s9r3

11418180,0,t3_62xy92,gt I noticed a section of the wall on my way out where the drywall was damaged and you could see the framing. With a building this old Im a little concerned about asbestos. Should I be?You dont say how old the building itself is but if the couple lived there for  years and theres never been any renovations to it then I would assume possible asbestos and plan accordingly.gt There was a bit of a smell...nothing too bad but definitely present. He acknowledged it and thinks its because he hasnt been able to open the windows. Should I be concerned about any biohazards? Dead mice etc.? Are mice biohazards?Dust and dirt accumulated over the decades can smell really odd compared at least to more recent dustdirt and if theres not been fresh air allowed into those rooms during that all that time that can make it worse.You should be concerned about roaches living or dead mice living or dead  insects of various types and other vermin.  Mice and roaches in particular love to nest in paper and cardboard so if theres a lot of those materials present old newspapers and magazines cardboard boxes etc. you should be prepared for them.You should be equally concernedif not more soabout vermin droppings feces urine carapace sheddings etc. as well.  And depending on how severe the hoard is you might want to be prepared for mold and bacteria. as well.gt There are some pretty precarious bookshelves and built structures. Im worried about them collapsing on me or him! Any suggestions for how to deal with that?Ill be candid the one time I had to deal with a nearcollapsing bookshelf I just went ahead and knocked it over then cleaned up from there.  Obviously this might not be a solution for your client especially if theres items on those structures that he doesnt want to risk getting damaged.Otherwise I dont have a suggestion here.  Is there another professional organizer whom you could ask for suggestions  someone with experience dealing with hoarders?,hoarding,dfq8m3k,6,t5_2s9r3
