Just dont jump into uni right away if you dont have something lined up that you want to specialize in. Also having a trade is good because youll always have something to fall back to.On a side note I fucking hate when people say you will never go back to school if you take gap years. Theyre usually the ones who push their kid into a degree they dont want to do and it causes them to flunk out drop out or switch majors a million times. Most importantly dude just breathe.

A bit. Of what could have been  my mind isnt letting anything go and I feel like a little kid who has let go of a giant balloon of potential and its floating away and away and away but all you can do is just stand there grounded while it disappears slowly into a speck in the sky. And then you walk away. People around me are growing up growing together and settling down together. Feels like the worst of both worlds when youre kicking yourself over what you both did and didnt do. Heart swinging both ways.Im reaching my mid twenties and if this isnt a kick in the pants then what else will it be? You know those quotes about living in the present spewed ad inifitum so much they just roll off your back? Feels like its totally come around and its hit me. I cant waltz through life like so many others around me seem to do so effortlessy. Take care of yourself guys.

Ok text her thursday to set up time no reply.  Whatever.   Couple weeks after ask her again. Yea sure!  paraphrased  Nice finally.  Same shit.  Repeat about five times and then I just gave up.  A few months after she snapchats me telling me to text her.  Ok we talk for a few hours and thats it.  A couple days later she says we should hang out.  Sound good maybe she wont skip this time....

Dont compare yourself to others as it is impossible to be the best nor should that be something that should be sought as nobodys value derives from one criteria. Those who do not treat you well are not people who you should strive to impress. Instead be yourself discontinue the notion that you must be better than others and instead strive to be the person you want to be.

And you know start a career. Ill have time for TV when Im old.I get really fucked up from caffeine sometimes. I get so irritable. I just lay there and tell myself not to ever drink caffeine again. As for sugar I usually have sugar free Red Bull... so literally none.The friends girlfriend is from Wales. I didnt ask him. I wanted to see how long it would take for it to come up. Even then he didnt talk about her much but he did eventually say her name at some point. The whole thing just weirded me out but since we dont live together anymore I just dropped it. He also had a baby with a different ex girlfriend of his in that time so that was weird. I dont really want to see her. New Years is gonna suck.,datfeel,cyev1ab,1,t5_2tfhd

He may go back to normal you may be able to forgive him for his behaviour but you wont get everything immediately.Time can only tell how your relationship with him evolves. Three and a half years is a long time for us kids and maybe there will be a positive outcome but I think you should just give him the space he needs. Dont blank him but dont try to resume all your friendly conversations with him like before.,datfeel,czgrmd3,2,t5_2tfhd
