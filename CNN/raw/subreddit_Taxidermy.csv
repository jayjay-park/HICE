881269,0,t3_247o8n,I havent done entire rodent skeletons but Ive done several rodent skulls  rat pups ASF rats and mice.Usually a couple hours gets the color off but if theyre the deep stained ones overnight has been safe for me too I normally work in the afternoonevening.Fizzing is very good! That means the tissueetc is dissolving and all bacteria is being eaten away thats what you want. Ive safely used this method about  times now and its never caused any problemsbreakagebrittleness. Just makes them nice and clean  brightness is a big of a variable Ive cleaned every skull right down to the bone but theres still some brownnessyellow tinges in spots Im sure a longer soak would safely eliminate them but Im happy with a more natural look.You can always take them out of the peroxide and rinse them in water to see the progress though generally just looking at them with the bubbles and all will give you a clear view of what the changes are.,Taxidermy,ch4gc6n,2,t5_2sj2g

4524561,0,t1_cszxv6r,we use duct tape instead of plastic and pins when we foam in the alterations. its faster foam wont stick to it and its very strong.

4953956,0,t3_3iqauu,It will be easier to diagnose with pictures but my first instinct is that it may have been bleachedboiled in bleach which does permanent damage that can include what you are describing. The only way you can really do anything at all about it is to spray on a few coats of matte lacquer although depending on the extent of the damage I cant guarantee this will help.,Taxidermy,cuizijm,3,t5_2sj2g

5477062,0,t3_3pxx7f,Beetles are a big responsibility. It doesnt really make sense to invest in them unless youre going to be processing a lot of carcasses. Museums and universities that prepare specimens to study or display might buy a dermestid colony as would businesses or individuals who make a living from taxidermy. Its not really necessary to buy them if youre just doing it as a hobby. You can if you want but you dont have to.If you want to have bugs clean your bones for you but dont feel like buying a lot of dermestids you can make a basic cage out of wire mesh or for small birds or other little projects get one of those plastic mesh bags people use to wash their underwear. Make sure the mesh container is firmly tied to a tree fence post etc so that scavengers such as foxes wont steal it. Place it near an ants nest and put your dead thing inside. Make sure youre the only one whos going to be opening the mesh container in the near future  tie it closed with cable ties or something whatever works for you. Then leave it for a few weeks and check on it periodically.NB dont put rotting animal tissue near boundary fences where your neighbours are going to smell it or anywhere thats going to upset your roommates or family or friends with the smell or sight. Not everyone likes taxidermy. P,Taxidermy,cwbqv4e,2,t5_2sj2g

9430534,0,t3_59quib,When curing with salt I leave feet and tails for as long as I can handle it! Usually a few weeks to a few months depending on the size. Most of my experience is with squirrels. Raccoons are much larger and have a lot more body fat even on paws. I Assume it will take quite a bit of time if you left all the bones in. Patience is a big part of taxidermy of any kind.  I accidentally made zombie mice when I put a couple of dead fuzzies in a badly sealed jar and forgot about them. Air does great alone but its hard to avoid mold and other bacterial growths. ,Taxidermy,d9bdv11,1,t5_2sj2g
