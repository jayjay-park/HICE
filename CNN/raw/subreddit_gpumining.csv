6301,0,t1_cef4sgg,So you dont think an r x would ever need more than w even if overclocked? I was planning having three rigs with  r s each. That said would a corsair w suffice if it also had an ii and  gb of ram?,gpumining,cef5k4g,1,t5_2z759
739635,0,t1_cgobj5n,That might be a good point...but I figured that Mastercoin was a scaled down version and it is doing fairly well...,gpumining,cgocn2u,1,t5_2z759
11622336,0,t1_dgdear5,Ive got an R  and with no tweaking its at MHs according to NiceHash on DaggerHashimoto not sure how accurate this isIt cost me  used vs.  that Im gonna spend on each RX  for my new rig so the initial investment is a lot lower for older cards at least in my experience Im going for s because unlike OP power is a concern for me,gpumining,dgdeif1,2,t5_2z759
11641732,0,t3_65gwcr,core speed  mem speed effects will depend on the algorithm youre currently running on it    for example on radeon rx   cards when mining daggerhashimoto  core clock can be reduced and memory increased along with latency tightened to gain efficiency    On my  Ti I just run everything at max  core  mem max power and let Nicehash sort out the most profitable algorithm. If you dont do this then youll have to maximize efficiency for your chosen algorithm,gpumining,dgflr0k,1,t5_2z759

11767521,0,t1_dgtlurn,Well. This isnt enough is it? We dont need a lot of random coins. Instead we need a new coin with a market share of about the same volume that ethereum has. And why would you be sure that there will exist such a coin based on POW?,gpumining,dgtvnlb,1,t5_2z759
11768751,0,t1_dgtvx0h,They are profitable because there is ethereum out there. If hypothetically ethereum goes to POS today then all the mining volume power would be distributed between other coins and profitability would become about  times lower than it is now. ,gpumining,dgu0op7,1,t5_2z759
11769949,0,t1_dgu2d55,They are and the prices are not rising. The prices are what they are right now. And if Ethereum would move to POS today then the prices of other coins would stay the same but the difficulty of obtaining them would increase by about  times. Hence the profitability of mining will be down by  times. Right?,gpumining,dgu5l0b,1,t5_2z759
