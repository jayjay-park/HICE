1573264,0,t1_cjd87k4,From another articlegtThe students said that the water level rose to several feet suddenly making it difficult for them to stand. We were all sitting on the rocks taking photos. There was a big rock in the middle of the river and everyone wanted to reach the top of that rock. Some made their way to it by stepping on some smaller rocks. After about  minutes the water level started rising. I was upstream and I noticed it first. I began screaming trying to alert everyone as I rushed back a shocked T.V. Suharsa said.gtFew students made futile attempts to rescue their friends. Few were trying to hold others hands and trying to pull them back but it was in vain as the water level rose in a few seconds said another student.gtAnother survivor Ravi Kumar said I tried to alert my friends but by then the water level had shot up.gtThough official help came much later villagers came to help the victims. The locals were also helping us. About  to  students were washed away in front of us. I could just see the head of one student but I didnt know if he was still alive.

3123651,0,t1_cohuqhh,Personally I think Albert Fish is the worst. Excerpt from a letter he wrote to victims parentsgt Several times every day and night he spanked them  tortured them  to make their meat good and tender. First he killed the  yr old boy because he had the fattest ass and of course the most meat on it. Every part of his body was cooked and eaten except Head  bones and guts. He was Roasted in the oven all of his ass boiled broiled fried stewed. The little boy was next went the same way. At that time I was living at  E  St rear  right side. He told me so often how good Human flesh was I made up my mind to taste it. On Sunday June the    I called on you at  W  St. Brought you pot cheese  strawberries. We had lunch. Grace sat in my lap and kissed me. I made up my mind to eat her on the pretense of taking her to a party. You said Yes she could go. I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked out. When we got there I told her to remain outside. She picked wild flowers. I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off. I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them. When all was ready I went to the window and called her. Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room. When she saw me all naked she began to cry and tried to run down stairs. I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama. First I stripped her naked. How she did kick  bite and scratch. I choked her to death then cut her in small pieces so I could take my meat to my rooms cook and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven. It took me  days to eat her entire body. I did not fuck her tho I could of had I wished. She died a virgin.,lastimages,colrk3l,5,t5_2wjmx

My favorite genre is documentaries because they are usually about specific people or events shown through film makers perspective. I have learned so much about totally random things I never knew I had an interest in. I gravitate to the fringe artists because I totally relate. It is wonderful to find acceptance from complete strangers like I get from these types of films. It makes me feel okay for being offbeat weird and nonconforming.

3549191,0,t3_30w4es,My thoughts are all over the place on this.... At first I think justice is served and if that was my kid Id do the same thing. But then if you think it out you risk never seeing your kid again by ending up and jail... And what if you miss shooting the guy  then you may never see your son and the pedophile still walks the earth. Ultimately I believe if properly convicted the pedophile would get what he deserves in jail not that I condone it  just how it is but even then you see mistrials and the guilty getting set free... so I think it is at this latter point when one should take justice in their own hands  when the system has failed them if that is what they are choosing to do.

5251457,0,t1_cviw3zp,If you were on fire and an old lady was blocking your path to the only water source youd be forgiven for throwing her aside like a rag doll in your effort to relieve the flames cooking your skin. Its a shitty thing to do that you wouldnt even consider if you were lucid but behaviour changes with the application of pain in a way thats tough to empathise with if you havent experienced it first hand.I was hospitalised for a while nearly a decade ago due to the severity of my depression. I know what its like to be in that level of discomfort and the rationalisations you make to relieve it under the sort of pressure most people will never even come close to experiencing. I look back on some of those thoughts with a mix of anxiety and shame as although I never followed through on some of the worse ones I very nearly did.Ultimately my point is that while the behaviour itself is selfish and wrong I agree ultimately the blame lies with the disease not the person. If this girl was healthy she would probably be just as judgemental about someone doing this as the guy I replied to. But she wasnt. When she made the call to kill herself she was in a great deal of pain and all that existed in that moment was the desire for it to all go away. Mental illness is many things but what it isnt is a moral failing on the part of whoever is unlucky enough to have it.,lastimages,cvizmnz,24,t5_2wjmx

5501440,0,t3_3qf3g9,Wikipedia articleA bunch more with his grave.His mule had a badass name  Evil MerodachgtEhrenburg Arizona TerritorygtDec.  gtWilliam G. Peckham Esq. Trinity Building New York gtDear Sir In acknowledging the receipt of your letter of Nov.  . I am pleased to be able to give you an account of the death of my friend Loring who was wellknown to me and whose untimely death is deeply regretted by me. We left Fort Whipple near Prescott Arizona Territory on Saturday Nov.  in the best of health and spirit. To be sure the stage was rather crowded but being all of such good temper we had a real nice time. Loring being the most lively of us all anticipating a speedy return to his friend East. Well he retained his inside seat until we reached Wickenburg on Sunday morning Nov.   when after leaving there he preferred to have an outside seat to which I most decidedly objected but he insisted on being outside for a short time. I had two revolvers and he had none in fact no arms whatever. He rejected my offer of a revolver saying at the time My dear Kruger we are now comparatively safe. I have traveled with Lieut. Wheeler for nearly eight months and have never seen an Indian. Well we rolled on until about  A.M. when the fatal attack was made. The first warning I had was the warning cry of the driver who cried Apaches! Apaches! At the same moment the Indians who lay concealed fired the first volley killing poor Loring the driver and the other outside passenger a Mr. Adams. They killed also the oft lead horse and wounded the other lead horse. The horses very much frightened then ran forward about twenty yards when they come to a sudden stop. At the same time Loring fell off the stage and so the other passenger. At the same moment the Indians fired the second volley from three sides  the both sides and rear  not more than four of five yards from the stage Killing Mr. Shoholm one of the inside passengers and wounding Miss Shephard SIC myself and a Mr. Salmon of Lieut. Wheelers party. The latter one was mortally wounded and fell out of the stage and crawled away but was finally captured by the Indians scalped and otherwise mutilated. The only one not then wounded was Mr. Hammet of Lieut. Wheelers party. Both he and myself commenced immediately firing. Each one fired six shots. Not have any more ammunition I paused firing. The Indians then disappeared behind the bushes.  gtFor what a terrible spectacle it was to see the six dead bodies in plain sigh! Loring was lying right under my very eyes not yet dead but suffering apparently terribly. He was shot through the left temple his right eye and his lungs. He suffer for about four minutes but I was positive that he died before I made my escape. Knowing that it would be useless to attempt to escape until the Indians would come back to plunder the stage. I remained perfectly quiet having the encaustic ascertained that Miss Shephard was yet alive but badly wounded. She succeeded in getting a loaded revolver from one of the killed passengers which she gave to me. I then told her to keep cool and to be ready to run as soon as I would give the signal. Well in about six minutes a terrible suspense I saw the Indians slowly creeping toward the stage. I counted and saw plainly fifteen Indians all dressed in blue soldiers trousers. When they came within five yards of the stage I jumped up yelled and fired at them. The woman at the same time yelled also and we succeeded adamantly in driving the off for the time being and got back to leave. Before I left the stage I cried out as loud as I possibly could if any one was left alive but only Mr. Adams answered but he was mortally wounded and could not even move his hand or feet I had to leave him to his fate. He was afterward found with his throat cut and otherwise mutilate. The Indians afterward followed me for about five miles and I had a running fight with them until I fell in with the buckboard. I had to carry the wounded woman for over two miles in my left arm. I myself received on shot through the right armpit coming out on the shoulder and two shots in my back. The woman also have three shots one dangerous.  gtHow I could escape with my live and be able to save the live of Miss Shephard is more than I can account for. That I left my mark with the Indians there is no doubt because two Indians died from gunshot wounds at Camp Date Creek Reservation but the commanding officer refused to have the thing investigated for fear he would find sufficient evidence that they were his petsthat is Camp Date Creek Indians. At all events there is no doubt whatever that the outrage was committed by Indians and the  by Camp Date Creek Indians those socalled friendly Indians who Uncle Sam feeds.  gtAfter the news reached Wickenburg we were brought to Wickenburg after sixteen hours of terrible suffering and agony. I stopped at the place of attack and closed the eyes of all my poor traveling companions. Loring poor boy was not mutilate but looked calm and peaceful excepting his fearful wound through the head. He wore soldiers clothing. His hat is in my possession now if you wish it you can have it. Loring and four of his companions in fate were decently buried the next day Monday Nov.   in nice coffins. I saw them buried. The other man who got scalped was buried on the road. Mr. Sexton of the Vulture Mine at Wickenburg attended to the funeral. Rest assured that our friend Loring has a decent funeral. Peace be with his ashes. I forwarded everything belonging to Loring to Lieut. Wheeler excepting his hat which you can have should you desire it. There are four bulletholes through the same. What Loring lost I dont profess to know. I know I lost everything but my life. The Indians got to my certain knowledge about twentyfive thousand dollars  nine thousand dollars belonging to me and Miss Shephard.  gtThere is not a particle of doubt in my mind that the attacking party were Indians. I have known Indians since the last five years and cannot be mistaken besides all indications show that they were Indians. Every citizen here will swear to it because those citizens tracked the Indians from place of outrage to Camp Date Creek. But the commanding officer Capt. OBeirne Twentyfirst Infantry not only allowed the Indians to go unpunished but also refused me Miss Shephard the two surviving cripples shelter. Yes Sir he ordered us off his reservation and I wish to heaven you would publish this ace of inhumanity in your NewYour papers. Please show this letter to Mr. Loring Boston Mass. who wrote to me the same time you did.gtI am Sir very truly yours. gtWilliam KrugergtChief Clerk to Capt. C.W.

6045750,0,t1_cxqpcom,The problem is that even with the current slow system of years of sitting on death row going through appeals many innocent people are still being executed. One study showed that over  of those sentenced to execution are most likely innocent and there have been some very public instances of mostlikely innocent people being executed such as Cameron Todd WillinghamWhile I understand the sentiment of wanting inmates sentenced to death to spend less time on death row reducing that time just makes it even more likely that wrongfully convicted people are executed. I had a small experience with the US criminal court system years ago and even in that I lost any faith I had that we are doing a good job of making sure that justice is done.

Or that Sheila or Rachel  I forget which  was cheating on the other with a FOURTH girl and Skylar knew about it and they wanted to either keep her quiet or reaffirm their bond by committing an heinous act together something they couldnt walk away from separately.Basically what happens when teenage girls who are already overdramatic go fullon psycho.Its been a while since I was so caught up in the case.

This is not new in the tech industry but as you said its a big deal in the sense that it was easily accessible and helped drive sales.gt The sense of ideals? what.Yes its a real thing.Go for a walk around your local community college and count how many Apple devices you see and who is using them. Talk to anyone that owns an Apple product and youll understand.gt lol Apple created a notable brand and you act as if thats some kind of knock against them. That goes back to the Macintosh anyway when Apple put out the first mass market PC. That stands out and they ran with it.Honestly Im not.

I dont limit myself to one side.

Can you name the CEO of Acer off the top of your head to which people should be directing their discontent for their use of sweatshops?I mean come the fuck on man.gt With the antiApple community sure.This is a nonsequitur.

Implying that it was a release or that the victims are in a better place is dangerous as others with suicidal ideation could easilly be impacted by such rhetoric.People are always eager to glorify their dead loved ones.  People desire for their memory to live on happily.  But people can and often do go too far.There is no justification for suicide and while pretending that there is may be comforting to victims families it might also be dangerously comforting to other suicidal people.I honestly cant even view the victims of suicide as actual victims.  People dont choose to be victimized.  People dont want to be victimized.  To me the only victims are the mothers fathers brothers sisters grandparents aunts unkles cousins friends classmates and neighbors whos lives will all be permanently altered by the needless death of someone they were close to.I dont condemn suicide because I want suicidal people to feel bad.  I condemn it because theres nothing more tragic than a person giving up on absolutely everything and ending their own lives when things would have gotten much much better for them if they had just kept living.,lastimages,d9mjfgk,0,t5_2wjmx

The sheer terror of knowing you will soon cease to exist and expire from the living and you have no power to change it really changes your perspective on things if you are lucky enough to live through it.My heart goes out to this poor woman and her family and any victims and survivors of violent crimes.  What happened to me was a minor inconvenience compared to such victims and even at that it impacted me profoundly.  ,lastimages,ddoxoni,5,t5_2wjmx

10794128,0,t1_ddtc5yx,Heres a sneak peek of rstopdrinking using the top posts of the year! I passed thirty years without a drink the other day. Im not looking for praise or trying to pat myself on the back. I just want anyone reading this to know Im proud to be not drinking with you tonight.    days sober after  years of having  drinks most nights to fall asleep or turn my brain off. I took care to hide it from everyone so nobody in my life knows I ever had a problem. Cant believe Ive made it  days just wanted to share it out loud.

11063977,0,t3_5xt8c5,Addiction really has no face. I was prescribed percocets for over three years after my last pulmonary embolism and getting off of them was a bitch I legitimately thought I was going to die and I wont lie  I did think of getting opiates the illegal route.The only difference between me and a junkie is my drug was legally prescribed. Opiates are very dangerous and docs are trigger happy to prescribe them.I dont fault anyone anyone at all who gets hooked on an opioid. Try one once if youre ever in an accident and are given too much dilaudid at a hospital for too long or you get into a car accident and your doc gives you oxy but suddenly cuts you off and you resort to h to not get sick. A lot of people did not choose this.She was beautiful. May she rest in peace.,lastimages,dem34h8,7,t5_2wjmx
