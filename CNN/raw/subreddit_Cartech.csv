476848,0,t3_1zio6a,I dont like using the cars value because thats too subjective  an unpopular car can have a low resale value but be a great car for its owner.  I would compare the cost of the repair to the cost of a comparable replacement car.  If a car is viewed by the owner to be generally reliable and worth  with a  repair I would repair the car if a similar replacement car would cost .  This can happen on old depreciated cars that have generally been maintained well.  ,Cartech,cfugxx5,1,t5_2unov

1260062,0,t1_cib26x3,At the time the motor was developed GM owned  interest in VM Motori. Then fiat bought them out two years ago very strategically I might add because now if GM wants to follow suit and they will they have no motor any longer.Rough estimates based on fuel prices are  years k per year will pay you back on fuel mileage. Edit and because its a diesel after those k miles you know shes probably got a lot left in her assuming the motor is a solid one. All I can find on it says it is built well just cant find any first hand experience. ,Cartech,cibdf52,1,t5_2unov
