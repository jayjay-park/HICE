564585,0,t3_20jfg5,There could be a few things wrong could be a fried final gain could be turned down by a potentiometer inside volume potentiometer could be busted.I would say open it and have a fiddle but I gather you are not too comfortable doing that?Perhaps take it to a commercial  amateur radio repair shop read truck cb shop if you are in the US.,cbradio,cg4g68y,1,t5_2sck8
1071958,0,t1_chpqpjz,gt But amps and modding the radio are illegal I had no clue.Feel free to have your radio peaked and tweaked modded. illegal? yes. are you going to get busted for it? very very doubtful. Now an amp over  watts on the other hand there is a chance you will get busted although I dont know of anyone who has an amp in their mobile that has been busted.,cbradio,chq4wli,0,t5_2sck8

3162503,0,t1_copsej9,Thanks. Sorry my mistake. Yeah spacemoneyaesthetics this thing will be on the top of my house.With a smaller one do you think I could build a base for it and then just move it between in and out when I am using it? I basically have a room whose window opens to a triangle formation of the roof below it so I am thinking I can open the window and put it out there and remove when desirable. With the big one I think itd look egregious and people in my neighborhood would wonder what the hell it is for.Is it always taller  more range? What kind of range could I expect from the Solarcon A CB Base Station Antenna? Am I supposed to be able to tell via the watts?Thanks. Sorry I am a complete newbie to this.,cbradio,copsimk,1,t5_2sck8

4936720,0,t3_3iimte,There are differences between transmit and receive distances.  The max distance of receiving depends on the output power of the transmitter.I do have the know how and ability to build a custom CB antenna that propogates nearly as well as a full quarter wave utilizing loading coils and other inductors to make the length shorter but I have none of the materials laying around including the sealant.  I also dont have a work space atm so I wouldnt be able to build one.Personally if you need a shorter whip I would suggest something from Wilson like a Lil Wil  with the appropriate NMO loaded coil mount.  I only suggest this because I only have one CB antenna and its a Lil Wil magnet mount but I also drive a sedan and am a broke college student.  Im sure there are better options out there.  As for increasing your reception center of your roof is your best bet.  If you pull a trailer then you should know that your strongest signal will be coming from behind you as well as your transmissions following the better ground plane that the trailer sets up.,cbradio,cugta0p,2,t5_2sck8
5155617,0,t3_3lmezz,Handheld CB radios are bulky inefficient and heavy. Theyre also expensive and probably wouldnt work with headsets. And when the band is open to skip there will be lots of interference. All of these problems are solved by GMRS and MURS radios. ,cbradio,cv7fzwy,5,t5_2sck8
5170335,0,t3_3ltrv9,I would use separate antennas for the scanner and the CB. You could use the same Antenna for your car radio and the scanner but reception might suffer on the scanner. ,cbradio,cv97s00,2,t5_2sck8
5543287,0,t1_cwiryne,So I unplugged and then re plugged all the connections and I somehow started to get some squelch and some light communication between drivers.  I asked for a radio check to which someone replied that they could hear me but not very well...  ,cbradio,cwk728v,1,t5_2sck8
5625147,0,t3_3s5yij,You can use this design for CB radio just stick your mobile antenna tuned to  meter on it and adjust the angle and length of the ground plane to match,cbradio,cwucptn,1,t5_2sck8

9064284,0,t3_54figg,I just picked up a box of CBs off Craigslist that had one of these. I have no idea what the price is but  for a CB isnt that bad. There are certainly newer and cheaper ones if you are only looking at price.,cbradio,d81dpi9,2,t5_2sck8
