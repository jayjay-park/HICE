Im only going to run each stage twice before the rally as state the WRC rules Then going to action. i think this is going to help me develop instead of just me memorizing the hole track.Have fun people.,simrally,clmdlxf,2,t5_324cu

3122454,0,t3_2vbst8,hp and torque arent everything. far from it. Newer WRC cars as well as any performance vehicles in any sport are consistently better than the older ones. All sports that depend on a machine and a driver are comprised of both driver and engineering competition. the way the suspension is tuned and how much we have learned about building suspension over the years makes a HUGE difference... probably more than the amount of power you can get out of an engine. And then downforce and aero surfaces to create stability or instability in strategic ways. Weve also come a long way in the last few decades with differentials. Basically cars nowadays compared to  years ago are practically fighterjets. ,simrally,coln3f3,1,t5_324cu

3228613,0,t3_2wxycc,woohooo top.  the rally was so much fun with the Porsche  GT RS first time I seriously tried RWD on RBR.  Never thought it would make sense to do that.Prospect Ridge and Mineshaft are some of my favorite tracks in vanilla RBR so this was kinda okay.  The second stage Finland was heavy.  It took me some while to get a feeling for this track but eventually I like it.  However I had a very silly crash exactly at the end of this stage with the finish sign which cost me four seconds... at least my car didnt break D As I see from the times I should have invest some more time on Limbo as I didnt have any major mistake in my run I think I was just a bit too slow in general on this stage.Also on the car selection I was quite unsure.  I was actually faster in the BMW but the handling is a lot cooler with the Porsche. stage   stage   stage   stage  Im looking forward to next week.  In vanilla RBR I actually dont like tarmac too much but maybe RBR is again going to surprise me!thanks udeadstump!,simrally,cownfbt,3,t5_324cu

5098752,0,t3_3ktk8k,yeah dirt rally can be really brutal i still think ive only finished in the top three of the rally part  time.  I swear the game is pencil whipping me.  RBR is really fun tho and feels more fair as far as your competitors go.,simrally,cv0l8tx,3,t5_324cu

6133185,0,t1_cymo8tq,I had trouble with the registry switching between CZ and RSRBR.  I would forget which one I had used last launch the wrong one and it would be all messed up.  It wasnt super difficult but it was annoying.  I like the idea of the CZ and if I had discovered it first it probably would be my default.  But now I am so ingrained with RSRBR that with my limited time I dont have time to learn how to change over.Those stages sound mighty tempting.  I will have to give CZ another go even though I suck at Semetin... also Semetin is a real stage too.,simrally,cyms1pn,1,t5_324cu

6857151,0,t3_49gb1u,Loch ArdThe lack of torque in comparison to the WRCs really made an impression even on the first stage maintaining momentum and picking decent lines was much more important than making big flicks and powering out of the corners. I ironically had a massive oversteer moment at  as I simply had to get the turn in when I hit the bump on the inside to not end up in the trees. Definitely my favourite stage of the rally and I had a really good feeling here making minimal mistakes even after being in practically every ditch.New BobsWhile I backed off a lot on this stage due to its difficulty I enjoyed it thoroughly nonetheless. A highlight was the massive jump at  you absolutely have to stay as far to the left as possible to have any chance of taking it flat even though its a right turn. Other than smacking the barrier at  and having a bit of brake spiking this was a relatively uneventful stage.Pirka Menoko IIA very enjoyable difficult stage you had to really wrestle the car to get it to turn in here but going flat out through a tight treelined forest will never get old. Had a close call with a snostalgic marshal at  and a deer at  but as with all of the stages here I definitely could of squeezed a bit more time out of the stages although I was happy with the result nevertheless.KippingeA wonderful stage to drive although I didnt quite capitalize on it here as I was . seconds down on my practice time focusing on instead ensuring myself a good finish to the championship if not a quick time to finish the rally with.Id say this was probably the only time Ive personally been quite nervous doing a rally this was basically the only rally Ive driven in that Ive actually had a shot at winning the championship in as the last season I won the last rally and only took it by a point even after uTByrel didnt compete in two rounds.,simrally,d0tkewe,4,t5_324cu

7009682,0,t3_4bfdly,MustaselkaThe first  minutes of the recording were corrupted but this stage went pretty well for me. Very difficult to balance how much snowbank to use but extremely rewarding as well.Noiker IIWell this was an eventful one at least. Clipped a banking with the rear of the car at  and spun losing about  seconds in the process half span at  nearly hit a tree at  and almost flipped the car at ..SvedalaThis in my opinion was the trickiest stage of the bunch and thus I was very cautious here not cutting any corners in fear of clipping a rock.Gran Canaria I never do well at this stage and this run was no exception turning in way too early for most of the corners so the fastest stage time was definitely a surprise here.Finally changed my ride height for this one but I didnt see any big improvements. Not a great rally from me but this is the first rally in  that Ive made a significant mistake so Im happy about that. I have no idea which car is the fastest from NGPRWD as the GT RS oversteers like no tommorow and all of the other cars are incredibly underpowered in comparison so itll definitely be interesting to see which one everybody picks.,simrally,d1aw6iz,6,t5_324cu

It works well for me as long as youre ok with an entry level wheel.The pedals would probably scoot on the floor if I didnt play on carpet with my ankles on the base but they work. You may want to add deadzone to the top of the pedal so it gets into the spring before the sensor registers.The wheel is a bit small sometimes my back gets a pinch after playing too long. If youre getting a replacement wheel go for a rs s? Whatever or alcantara but thats a fine starter if youre unsure.,simrally,daqx3gs,3,t5_324cu

10085234,0,t1_dbll0bj,Oh its not that I didnt like them! Its just that I had jumped straight into RSRBR without having played the vanilla RBR and the reason for that was that at that time I had my driving wheel set at  degrees of rotation and RBR was unplayable for me and other sim racers too. So I thought to try RSRBR to see if it was better and I could play it with the NGP cars but still there was a lot of rotation.So I decided to uninstall everything find out what I was doing wrong and then start with vanilla RBR so that I can play the Rally School and learn the game and then move into RSRBR. And I did that after setting my wheel to  degrees and applying filters to all my axes too. I havent finished the school yet I am at the final stage and then I am going to do quick rallies to learn the stages.One gripe I had with RSRBR was that I couldnt play a Rally Season without tweaking as I found out. I had to install manually or with VDRMinstaller maybe a NGP car and play the game without loading RScenter because it would reset the cars.Anyway the reason I asked about RSRBR  is because currently I have not RSRBR or any other mods installed and I intend to have separate installation for RSRBR RBRTM and RBR  just to enjoy all flavors of RBR. But since I have enrolled for the RSRBR  championship I would like to know if a RSRBR  version is coming soon so that I install that one instead of RSRBR .,simrally,dbm4haw,1,t5_324cu
