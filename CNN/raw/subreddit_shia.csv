1568810,0,t1_cjcw3kv,Salaam! Shayk Yassir alHabib is a joke within the Shia community. Nobody takes him seriously and he is seen as a fraud. Please do not take any of his content as orthodox Shii Islam. He is has some followers and some people in the Shii community call it the Yassir alHabib cult. Unfortunately his material is easily accessed on youtube and is easily confused with authentic Shii material. His views are seen as extreme twisted and intolerant. I hate to talk bad about other people astaghfirullah but I feel like this man is truly toxic to the message of Islam. The Shia Imams never indulged in intolerance or hate towards fellow believers. He totally goes against the message by spreading vile curses and abuse towards various Sahaba etc etc. Only Allah swt truly knows what is in Yassir Habibs heart may Allah swt guide him. ,shia,cjcx9i7,5,t5_2sg7b

3477067,0,t3_302pxw,Salam! My condolences to you on the night of the martyrdom of our masooma Lady Fatima as the prophets daugther.Im not sure what sources you are looking at. The Namaz is pretty similar to the Sunni Namaz to be honest with only some minor differences.  Hold hands by side not accross chest or naval. In the st and nd Rakats recite Surat AlFatihah and another COMPLETE Surah not a peice of a Surah like some Sunnis do. After reciting the nd Surah in the nd Rakat it is optional to raise your hands into qunoot like praying to Allah palms outstretched and say a Dua to Allah before going into Ruku. A standard Dua to say is Rabanna Atena fid dunya hasanatan wa fil akhirati hasanatan wa kina adhaban nar. Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa aale Muhammad. All BismillahiRahmaniRaheem must be said OUTLOUD before each Surah. You cannot say Ameen after Surat AlFatihah or your namaz will be void. When sitting after the nd Rakat say Alhamdulillah Ashhadu an la ilaha ilAllah wa dhahu la sharika la. Wa ash hadu ana muhammadan abduhu wa rasooluhu. Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa Aale Muhammad. After each rakat their must be a very brief period of sitting before rising for the next rakat coming from sujood.  The third and fourth rakats if applicable you can either say Surat AlFatihah silently with bismillahirahmaniraheem outloud or SubhanAllah waAlhamdulillah wa La Ilaha IlAllah wa AllahuAkbar three times.When completing your prayer in sitting position say Alhamdulillah Ashhadu an la ilaha ilAllah wa dhahu la sharika la. Wa ash hadu ana muhammadan abduhu wa rasooluhu. Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa Aale Muhammad. Asalam Alaika iyyan nabbiyu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu asalam alaina wa ala ibadil lahis salihin. Then Say AsalamAlaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh looking forward not side to side then three Takbirs AllahuAkbar AllahuAkbar AllahuAkbar.  It is completely acceptable to combine Dhur and Asr together and Maghrib and Isha together.These are the biggest differences from Sunni prayer that I can think of being a former Sunni. Perhaps if you had specific questions that would enable me or others to help you more. Here is something uheyimhey wrote for me a long time ago that may also be enlightening. I asked this when I was learning to pray the Shii styleThere are many recommended acts mustahabat to do in Salat. If we strip all the mustahabat away we are left with what is obligatory wajib and the remaining prayer is actually quite short. The word mustahab in Arabic is derived from the word istihbab which means love. So it is out of love for Allah swt that we decorate our Salat with these mustahabat. Thats just a little context Ill move on to answering your question.Most resources on the internet really only mention the wajibat of Salat and add a couple mustahabat. I havent seen a comprehensive list of mustahabat so Ill try to mention what I can here.    Im not entirely sure when to raise my hands for TakbirThe only Takbir that is wajib is the first Takbirutul Ihram. It is also wajib to raise your hands for this Takbir. From then on every other Takbir is optional and it is optional to raise your hands. A good time to do Takbir is when yourre going from one action of Salah to the next. For instance before entering Ruku you can recite the Takbir and raise your hands. Before you go into Sujood you can recite a Takbir. The AhlulSunnah perform these Takbirs in the same ways and at the same places although they usually dont raise their hands.    Is there other variations of things to say?The wajib of Sujood is either saying Subhana Rabbiyal Aala wa bihamdhi once or SubhanAllah x. This is the absolute minimum as long as you say either of this you have performed a correct Sujood. From then on you can mix and match. Doing it Sunni style is also acceptable because it satisfies the condition of saying Subhana Rabbiyal Aala at least once.The most common variation is Subhana Rabbiyal Aala wa bihamdhi once SubhanAllah x Allahumma salli ala Muhammadin wa aali muhammad wa ajjil farajahum. But you can mix it up depending on what youre feeling.    Also just other intricacies of Salat    The wajib of Ruku is Subhana Rabbiyal Atheem wa bihamdhi Im not sure if SubhanAllah x covers it it probably does but you might want to double check that and you can add to that whatever you like. Most people say something like Subhana Rabbiyal Atheem wa bihamdhi SubhanAllah x Allahumma salli ala Muhammadin wa ahl muhammad wa ajjil farajahum.    We have narrations that say the best dua is Allahumma salli ala Muhammadin wa aali muhammad. So it is very good to say that at the end of whatever you choose to say. We also have narrations that say you should add wa ajjil farajahum to the end of Allahumma salli ala Muhammadin wa aali muhammad. It means and hasten their reliefreappearance and this is in reference to Imam Mahdi as.    Before reciting TakbiratulIhram after having recited the Iqamah it is recommended to recite  Takbirs you can do so in a lower voice raising your hands for each one.    It is recommended to whisper Alhamdulilahi Rabil alamin directly after reciting Surat AlFatiha in the first and second rakat.    When choosing a Surah to recite after AlFatiha it is very highly recommended to recite Surat AlIkhlas in at least one of the rakat. It is makrooh detestable not recommended to recite the same Surah after AlFatiha in both the first and second rakat except for AlIkhlas. AlIkhlas is the only Surah where it is acceptable to recite it after AlFatiha in both the first and second rakat. In fact the virtues of Surat AlIkhlas are so great that The Holy Prophet saws once said O Ali your example in my ummah is like surah Ikhlas and whoever recites surah al Ikhlas once has in fact recited one third of the Quran so whoso recites it  times has in fact recited the whole Quran.    In the second rakat after having recited AlFatiha and another Surah and before going into ruku it is highly recommended to go into qunoot thats just an image from google. This is for all prayers. While in qunoot you can make dua for whatever you like and in any language. There are of course certain dua from the Quran and from the Ahlulbayt as that are recommended to say. You can look these up on duas.org or there is a fantastic book that has an act of worship for literally everything which is called Mafatih AlJinan. There is a particular copy by Ansariyan publications that has the arabic english and transliteration all in one. I have this version myself and I highly recommend it. Ansariyan are also renowned for translation many Shia books into english I cant speak highly enough of them. Generally speaking there is a certain etiquette to be observed when it comes to dua. Firstly after invoking the name of Allah and glorifying him we send blessing upon the Holy Prophet saws and his holy household as and then we ask for others what we ask for ourselves and then we end our dua by once again sending blessings upon the Prophet saws and his household as. This isnt an obligatory etiquette by any means its just a nice recommended guideline to follow.    In the third and fourth rakat if you choose to say the dhikr subhanAllah alhamdulilah la illaha il Allah Allahu akbar three times you can whisper astaghfirulAllaha rabbi wa atubu ilay.    In the fajr maghrib and isha prayers it is obligatory to read the Surahs of the first and second rakat out loud including the Bismilah arahman arahim we consider that part of the Surah. Bismilah arahman arahim is recited before every Surah and is considered part of the Surah. If you choose to read AlFatiha in the third and fourth rakat then it is obligatory to read the entire Surah as a whisper. The dhikr is a whisper as well.    In the duhr and asr prayers it is obligatory to read the Surahs of the first and second rakat as a whisper but it is recommended to say Bismilah arahman arahim out loud. Once again cant stress this enough Bismilah arahman arahim is recited before every surah and is considered part of the surah. Also just like in the maghrib and isha prayers If you choose to read AlFatiha in the third and fourth rakat then it is obligatory to read the entire Surah as a whisper. The dhikr is a whisper as well.    Combining prayers. It is perfectly acceptable to prayer the asr prayer right after the duhr prayer and to pray the esha prayer right after the maghrib prayer.    After having completed the prayers it is highly recommended to say tasbih al Zahra Allahuakbar x Alhamdulilah x subhanAllah x before unfolding your legs. Its rewards are too great and too many to mention here. It is also recommended to go into Sajdat al Shukr and say Shukran Illah x and you can add any dua you wish.In conclusion It is important to be mindful that these are just acts. Its one thing to go through the motions but it is more important to have presence of mind and heart during prayer and to be aware of the spiritual aspects of prayer. The Arabic word for prayer Salah is derived from the word Silah which means connection. Our prayer is our own personal connection to Allah swt. Each prayer is a spiritual journey.So this covers most of the common recommended acts. You probably know a lot of this stuff already so I apologise for the length inshAllah it is understandable and helpful to you. Im also more than happy to elaborate where I can or clear anything up.,shia,cpom0ek,10,t5_2sg7b

Zaidi Fiqh is very similar to Hanafimy Islamic Imam supported Zaidis against the oppression of UmmayadsI doubt u even seen the evidence which i linked u to.....??? If it wasnt for those two vids i found recently in the late Summer?the two links in my Original Question from Yasir Qadir I would never have KNOWN any differences within Shiite...... there is no conspiracy here brother? plzz look into the links i have seen and made my conclusion based on those views.Which is y Im here Its a FACT that Zaidi Shiism is Oldest Sect of Shia. I just want see what other Shias think about Other Shiite sects that differ from one another???? There isnt good websites about Shiites here in the internet......HistoricallyCulturally Sunnis and Zaidis have called SevenersTwelvers  as Rafidis which i didnt know. In the Internet and around Sunnis who arent Alim U dont hear this.......As Hanafi the fact that Wemy Imam Hanafi supported ONLY one sect of Shiites astonishes me!!! soo dont take my word......look into the links I provide then make ur HONEST comment about the OTHER Shiites who disagree with u?I want to see How Shiites see each other who are in disagreement between Zaidi Ismaili Twelvers.,shia,d7hkg0p,1,t5_2sg7b
