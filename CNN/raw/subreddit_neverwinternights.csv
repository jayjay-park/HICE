3165113,0,t1_cop578l,It looks like Ive actually found the problem. It turns out that deleting the files for the Customize Character Override Hak lets me load my games just fine. The problem is that well Im not sure I want to play without that hak. Do you have any ideas about how I could get the module and the hak to work together?,neverwinternights,coq29sx,2,t5_2umg9

8409630,0,t3_4swhhj,Same here on my gtx. Tried all sorts of tweaks nothing worked so far. Had no trouble on my gtx. Ive sought help from the Neverwinter Vault advice i got was that it was driver version or it could be the Pascal tech as you mentioned.Had to resort to playing on an old laptop.,neverwinternights,d5sqyk9,2,t5_2umg9
9223443,0,t1_d8kg91v,My guess is probably as good as yours at this point. As far as I remember only two things affect EXP gain and neither seems to properly explain things in your scenario. ,neverwinternights,d8l5112,2,t5_2umg9
9223540,0,t3_56crqg,Actually that is quite interesting Jeremy Soule composed music for both games. I was playing Skyrim when I was in a cave and I thought the music sounded VERY familiar as in I swear it was from Neverwinter. Went on wikipedia and sure enough...I wouldnt be surprised if a lot of the same instrument libraries and assets that were used in Neverwinter found their ways into the Elder Scrolls games...infact I was sure half of the music from Skyrim was recycled  rearranged Neverwinter music...They music from the first game was so good I didnt even mind that they just cut and pasted it into  lol,neverwinternights,d8l5gyl,2,t5_2umg9

9907826,0,t3_5hbj25,You could try manually patching the gameI dont mean to rub salt into the wound but you really should patch any cRPG to its latest version in this case .  before you invest any time in them.  Good luck!,neverwinternights,daz0hki,1,t5_2umg9

10905245,0,t1_de4nnp7,Grimgnaw is possibly the most powerful hireling due to his eventual permahaste and cold damage.  No other companion has either of these.  Also he has the best base saves and a stunning fist that connects A LOT.  Good choice and lots of luck keeping up with him!,neverwinternights,de4sr86,1,t5_2umg9
11114655,0,t1_deqheu0,I can honesty say that the AOL Neverwinter put my and others job in jeopardy.  But it was the businesss fault.  A T connection was just too delicious to pass up when the Web was in its infancy.,neverwinternights,deru503,1,t5_2umg9
