3186946,0,t1_cos9tjp,Yep. It seems like Bay wouldve accepted partial responsibility and regret for it before everyone kept telling her how bad it was. In the newest episode spoilers sorry she even tells Emmett that it wasnt just Tank that did something wrong she messed up too.,SwitchedAtBirth,cosbsmk,4,t5_2ux23
10582002,0,t3_5rgn5z,This is friggin ridiculous. It wasnt a RANDOM costume party and it wasnt like he dressed like a thug with a gun he dressed as a rapper and did a really good job with it. I dont see anything wrong it personally. Nor did I see anything wrong Daphines costume. A lot of the comments were on her costume as well. SHE WENT AS KATY PERRY! I Really really hope they are going somewhere with this. ,SwitchedAtBirth,dd7ga09,16,t5_2ux23
