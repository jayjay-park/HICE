9293417,0,t3_50k82k,Probably too late in your case but heres my  dollars worth anyway inflation is a bitch!.Theres no contract you can write up to protect yourself. Youre buying a used item online. Caveat emptor. Its all on you. If the seller isnt willing to come to your house and I understand why if its a matter of personal safety you should be offering to go to his in order to see if the item works. If he doesnt want people at his place either then you should just walk away or roll the dice that the thing works.,kijiji,d8u09mj,2,t5_2qtqm
