7861038,0,t3_4mzwmd,I still havent met everyone yet aiming for Bronwyn tonight still have yet to meet Vang but once I do Ill probably head into here to discuss. There are some big things weve learned that Ive avoided talking about as well and am interested in discussing them once Ive got the rest of the initial facts myself. ,Serpentine,d3zngun,1,t5_3e9uo
7933469,0,t1_d47qt34,Thanks for your response! Yeah I have  bonds I think.. but maybe its down to . And then I also have one character I am sort of against right now I bet its the same person as yours  haha.  Im glad this is a good technique then I want to learn everything I can about the mystery of the bridge but I think I only recently noticed that getting to know the characters helps too. And I think as the audience we can influence outcomes and things like that. Yeah sometimes I get stuck too and all I have are a million questions but then I realize its more rewarding to help a character than to just gather information. either way Im having a blast!
