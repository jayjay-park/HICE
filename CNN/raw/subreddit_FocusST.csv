5248826,0,t1_cvinfab,I would start with the fundamentals. Tuning involves several aspects if you want to be proficient at it. First you need to understand how the internal combustion engine works as whole. This includes fuel delivery spark and air turbocharging. You need to develop a very solid understanding of this and I recommend reading several books that cover this including Maximum Boost by Corky Bell. Being familiar with direct injection really helps as well. After this start learning about the different tuning variables that are ST specific. Purchase AccessTuner Race from COBB and look through the tables and documentation. Make sure you understand what they do and how they interact  there are many tables. Compare OTS tunes from them to the OEM calibration and understand what they have done. After this start making small changes and testing ... lots of testing and data analysis to make sure that the changes you make in the tune correlates to the changes experienced by the motor and meets your intentionsgoals. ,FocusST,cvio7rr,6,t5_2unrr

5763109,0,t1_cxbeus1,I apologize for how long this is about to be...I can produce them for the Fiesta ST which for the sake of argument has the same exact problems with heat soak that the Focus ST suffers from.Here is a datalog at stock that someone posted on fiestast.net. Ambient temperature of  degrees Fahrenheit. You can see how the charge temps climb from . F to . F over the course of the run.Thats a . degree over  seconds or so.Now heres one of my personal logs with the latest Cobb v OTS tune I was trying out. Ambient temp was like  F. You can observe how the temperatures climb from . F to . F for a total of . degrees over  or so seconds. This gives us a delta of . degrees if we dont account for margins of errors temperature barometrics etc. Its negligible at best.Both cars were wrung out at WOT until ish RPM which is just a hair past the redline for the FiST.Given the data we see here it is easy to argue that the heat soak differences are minor at best.Just for fun here is a glimpse at one of my truly aggressive custom tunes from Randy at Mountune. This puts down about HPTQ on average compared to the HPish torque in the Cobb OTS tunes. The timing is much more aggressive on this tune by a large margin.The temperatures range from . F to . F and leave us with a temperature delta of . F over about  seconds.I can hit about a s flat on the  mile on both the OTS and custom tune from Randy on an imperfect back road. At the strip it would likely do a bit better. Maybe mids? With tires that dont suck I would definitely reach that number. At Stock the Fiesta ST can do the  in .s with a professional driver behind the wheel. The grandest majority normal drivers will never get anywhere near that time on the stock tune.As you can see if we account for margins of error temperature weather etc. All things being equal there is not THAT much of a difference in heat soak when going from stock to tuned for the ecoboost engines with the stock intercooler.Do I think this platform NEEDS one? Hell fucking yes. Do I think it should come before an AccessPort? Maybe. It depends on what you want. We heat soak even at stock tune. Might as well gain gobs of power in the car and THEN put the FMIC on. I think the biggest factor that makes me pick the AP over the FMIC is not that power it brings but the quality of life improvements. It gives you the ability to remove that annoying rev hang that Ford puts into our cars. It removes torque truncations in gear one and two. The fuel mapping is arguably better and not tuned to meet some bullshit CAFE standard. Finally you get the power advertised on the box as it were. Our cars are definitely all over the place in terms of performance from what Ford says they can do. This brings us some consistency.,FocusST,cxbgttt,1,t5_2unrr
5848906,0,t1_cxm20bk,My favorite part of an AWD car on fresh snow is TC all the way off build speed cut wheel to left and lift off as you begin sliding right give it a nice hand brake jerk to slow skid the rears if youre moving sideways cut the wheel all the way right and give her gas modulate the gas and ebrake and crab walk the car perfectly sideways for as long as you want you have to keep the rears sliding and the fronts gripping.

You will probably be smoother if you overestimate your revs a bit though it would be ideal to match it as closely as possible.

11034151,0,t3_5xjxkw,Id say its a coin flip on whether or not it was driven hard. I baby mine for the most part. My only worry would be that since it was a company car the people driving it might not think twice about obsessive redlining and LSPI since its not them paying the bills.,FocusST,deip2ga,4,t5_2unrr

11341869,0,t3_61uycr,No drone. Sounds stock from inside the cabin. The only time I actually heard my res delete when I had it was when my gf gave me a few revs while Im behind the car and going WOT in a tunnel. Have the MBRP XP catback on my car now.,FocusST,dfhkxir,1,t5_2unrr
11342924,0,t1_dfho538,Depends on budget. CPE Cobb Mountune and MBRP are just a few. Also might want to look into getting a new intercooler. ,FocusST,dfhp8gv,1,t5_2unrr
11364303,0,t3_6261kj, is fine if youre completely stock. The ECU compensates for octane differences. You lose hp running  as the ECU cannot add enough timing advance to get to the advertised  numbers. Its noticeable but for daily driving not a big deal.  makes a noticeable difference in the ST. It is NOT A FUEL QUALITY difference merely octane. Higher octane lets the ECU add more ignition timing without detonationknock which increases power output to a point.If youre tuned this changes but your tuner can tell you the parameters theyre expecting given the supplied maps. For example I have a tune thats mapped to use the OAR Octane Adjust Ratio value in the ECU so I can switch between  without worry. This is due to geographical availability of those two grades I can normally find  but when im way out in the country sometimes all I can get is . Some other popular tunes ignore the OAR value and EXPECT you to be running  at all times. And there are even other possibilities so again... ask your tuner if you go that route.Pedantic people will point out that some companies DO put a different additive package to reduce carbon deposits etc to their premium  fuel so theres a quality difference from that perspective but our cars are Direct Injection so no or VERY little fuel ever touches the backside of the intake valves which is where most carbon deposit issues are,FocusST,dfk4eqg,9,t5_2unrr
11370799,0,t1_dfkulkl,Ford is pretty committed to their ecoboosts in all their cars in the US. Diesels in the US seem least imo to get a bad reputation of being dirty. Also its still a stick shift which that in itself turns people away. They should have a diesel f before a focus Imo.,FocusST,dfkux8q,1,t5_2unrr
11388017,0,t1_dfmknnx,Well called and emailed them back. It was close to closing so i only got a quick reply back thats a general manager would get a hold of me tomorrow.I think from now on i will be bringing my own oil in to have them use and deffinitly checking under the hood before leaving.Depending on how tomorrow goes will determain if i use this dealership again. Ive had good dealings with them before and any place can have a tech fuck up. Just depends on if the dealership steps up and owns it.,FocusST,dfmt9r1,5,t5_2unrr
