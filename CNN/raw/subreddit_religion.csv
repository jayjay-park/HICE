But coming from an anthropological point of view they are VERY real!There is so much social organization in this movement its undeniable...if you consider Facebook Twitter Reddit  many many social organization areas  as real.  That very denial is built within the idea of atheism though  because while many will claim it is the lack of belief in gods there is a lot that comes along with that.  The popular idea of the time that has been around for a while is that Science is what gives us our answers.Generally a lot of the refutes against religion and arguments for atheism is that it is logical and provable which often includes a material aspect.  Thus what happens in real observable life is real.  Popular atheism or atheists  theyd get mad if I generalized would seem to me as being in denial of reality whereby reality is coming to include the internet.,religion,cezaaiv,2,t5_2qh39

That would be an attempt to show that his writings were restricted by the church instead of what I was arguing earlier. Is that why youre replying?Because if thats the reason you might want to be aware that Bacons major works the Opus Maius Opus Minus and Opus Tertium were all written in the mids. These were the works that influenced the acceptance and spread of the scientific method in Europe. If youll look back to that section you quoted youll realize that they were written about ten years after he became a friar.But wait theres more! The works were written because the Pope i.e. the Catholic Church specifically requested that Bacon write them! After Clement IV became pope in  he created a special commission for Bacon for the purpose of advising the Church on scientific matters. All of his works produced in this period were sent directly to the Pope for review.So was that the reason that you quoted that passage? ,religion,cg17la3,3,t5_2qh39

EDIT Im not a Kemetic because I think the ancient Egyptians were right about everything. I am a Kemetic because I feel devotion to the gods especially Hathor because the myths and rituals touch me and because Kemetic practice feels like a good way to interact with these gods. In addition because it is polytheistic it is more flexible I am not required to chop away other peoples experiences and even some of my own to fit in some Procrustean bed of a neat and tidy set of beliefs.It also helps that in religions like my own both in ancient times and today it isnt so much about adhering to a list of beliefs but about doing things.

657183,0,t3_21lm3x,I think like many things in life its complex.I think Judaism has many components including ethnicity religion and culture.  Certain people fit more with some of these aspects of Jewish identity than others.For example I know people who identify as Jewish and are even observant andor active in synagogues or religious communities but if you ask them about their beliefs are atheist.  I also know people who come from Jewish families and identify as Jewish but are essentially nonpracticing and have nonpracticing parents.Ive seen this in both my friends and family...Im  Jewish by heritage and my dad is  but according to Jewish tradition hes not really Jewish because his mothers mother wasnt.  And hes completely nonpracticing  nonobservant and doesnt identify as Jewish.  But he speaks some Yiddish and grew up in Brooklyn around lots of Jews so he seems more immersed in Jewish culture than some of my friends who identify as Jewish.So I think being Jewish is very multifaceted.  There is the question of the matrilineal thing theres the question of being observant or practicing theres the question of how much Jewish culture a person passes down.I tend to respect peoples selfidentification as a matter of my beliefsnot just for Judaism and I dont like to many any ontological claims about whether on not someone is really Jewish because I have heard people put forth different definitions and also Ive seen examples of people where applying one definition or standard to them doesnt seem useful in all situations.,religion,cgeyzb8,2,t5_2qh39

Its likely a regional thing I imagine more folks from more denominations in Ohio where my wifes family is from would take a softer view of things but I still think its safe to say a sizable number of Christians would sympathize with the OPs viewpoint.I also feel like the OPs apparent overarching point of Dont be that guy who makes people disgusted with our faith because of your wild zealotous arguing with nonbelievers is valid regardless of those finer details.

696750,0,t1_cgj4ihg,Soo looks like youve gotten a lot of context type answers but the one that I was taught and Im hoping others will confirm is that the daughter of the rd Guru made the request for Guruship to remain in the family. Her request was honored and it just so happens that no daughters were born to the Gurus from that point on so the situation never arose. So in a sense it can be said that it was a woman who guided the Guruship for the next  stages. The other answers people have given are fairly credible but not concrete as youve already found some flaws. Many Sikhs like myself consider the story of the rd Gurus daughters request to be the truth behind it all.Also Gurbani states that Purakh mai naar naar mai purakha  Female is in the male male is in the female.The Gurus physical embodiments were born out of women nurtured by women guided by women. They expressed their love and desire for God from a womans perspective. They praised women and held them to be equal in every regard.SGPC is an irrelevant point. They are like the Republican party of the Sikhs in the sense that they started off as the good guys well liked by almost everyone but then became corrupt and blind to the religion over time. To use them as an example of Sikhi is a mistake.Yes the Sikh leadership has been pretty male dominated but this is mostly true AFTER the British colonization. Before Sikhs were led by men and women alike. Women from the Gurus families were treated as equals to the Gurus themselves. In fact the first Sikh ever was Guru Nanak Dev Jis sister Nanaki Ji. Another thing to remember is that even if women were to be the true leaders of communities their husbands would still get the credit because of the cultural aspect. As an example my grandma was without a doubt the head of our household but people still referred to our family by my grandpas name.

Such a becoming is possible only if predicated upon the logic of Gods qualitative otherness to the world.I ask the author why must we clunk our head on the glass ceiling of dualism amp make this rather baseless assumption?An ocean becomes a wave and many other things like currents eddys  tides and whirpools but lets keep it simple. That wave has structural integrity empirical existence stuff that you can touch taste even dive into if youre at the beach all the qualities we attribute to creation. But it never ceases to also be the ocean. In its wave state it is mutable temporary...then it crashes on the shore amp continues to be what it was all along.How much more apt is this allegory when the Ocean from which the wave originates is infinite One and boundless? Far from being false the Christian gospel is simply the ultimate dramatization of the manner in which ALL creation arises from God himself.

Thats been the trend for the last millennia particularly during the last few centuries and theres no indication that that trend is slowing down. Every why science explains opens up a few more so theres an almost endless quest to find out what they all are. We as a species are going through them one at a time.The one why that it may never explain is the one that lies beyond the Big Bang why did it occur in the first place. Everything else given enough time resources and ingenuity is within our ability to figure out.Ultimately religion or the presence of a divinity doesnt really explain why. It provides an arbitrary justification and closes the door to further investigation. To say because God seems to be a bit of a shortcut. It doesnt actually explain much it just puts it in the hands of some being weve never seen whose purpose eludes us.It sounds to me though like youre looking for an ultimate purpose not so much a cause. While you and I might want for there to be an actual purpose to the universe our belief and hope doesnt matter and certainly doesnt shape reality.

If you word questions in extreme ways then you stop getting a majority.Evidently not. Specifying a young Earth still produced a majority of Christians who agreed. gtI.e. youll get a different breakdown of answers if you ask people if they think God created people I wouldnt think thats an extreme view myself as you would if you ask people if they support the teaching of a literalistic youngearth Creationism in public schools. I would think thats a more extreme view.This is a very basic point you continue to repeat as if Im an idiot who cannot understand it. I fully understand it. I am trying to examine the issue with you more closely. Lets really sink our teeth into this and look into the specifics of how these polls were worded and the relationship between that wording and the results they got. The poll I provided for example specified a young Earth yet a majority of Christians agreed with that.gtI would doubt it would be a majority of Christians.What matters here is what the evidence supports not how a stranger feels about it. Your core point appears to be that when a poll is worded mildly a majority will agree while if it is worded in an extreme way youll get minority agreement. The opposite is true here. The wording of the poll specified an Earth younger than  years a position I hope you agree is extreme. Yet a majority of Christians agreed with that.

Perhaps some examples of daynight symbolism in various religions?The only thing that comes to mind might with respects to Islam is the star and crescent moon symbol.

After the fall of the Ottoman Empire post World War I the star and crescent symbol was incorporated into the Turkish flag.But it didnt come to be associated with Islam until around  or . Even then its use was sporadic until the rise of the Arab nationalist movements in the s. And frankly I find it amusing that Arab nationalists adopted the symbol at all because of their contempt for anything not Arab including the Ottoman Empire.The crescent moon symbol minus the star was used at least by the th century during the crusades.

1281457,0,t1_cidre2q,Im not sure how you could fail to come to this conclusion.God could create a trillion Christs and nail them all to crosses experiencing no pain trauma or humiliation and indeed excising those very concepts from reality such that in total preservation of all beneficial aspects of the universe free will compassion Game of Thrones et cetera suffering simply ceases to be a meaningful ideal.He could rewrite the boundary conditions of the universe such that in absolute free will and without any influence on his part all humans naturally worship him and live virtuous lives free of wickedness or negative emotions.He could force squares to be circular while they are still squares. He could set two equal to three and reconcile the entire quantum structure of the universe such that nothing is affected by this change or such that everything is. The thing about God as described in the Bible is that its not an omnipotent being  it uses flaming tornadoes floods voices pageantry to get its way. It acts in ways that humans can understand and detect rather than simply changing the structure of reality  assuming it would even need to do so implying that reality could move out of alignment with its omniscient plan  to conform to its desire. Christianity in its modern form is very clear that God is omnipotent however and omnipotence  allpower  changes the game.There are a lot of questions raised by why an omnipotent being would act so oddly  sending a flooding to wash the earth clean rather than simply removing everyone it dislikes from existence or better yet not crafting a universe where entities it would dislike would come into being in the first place  and one of them in the same vein is why exactly god would incarnate an avatar and have it nailed to a piece of wood to impress upon us its regret for an action it took with the full alltimeperceiving benefit of omniscient awareness.At the time God created the universe it was aware and had absolute veto powerful of every individual event in the entirety of reality from the smallest movement of atoms to the grandest collision of galaxies. Omniscience implies it could experience all those moments from all perspectives and simultaneously across time. Omnipotence implies it could alter reality to excise any unwanted elements without influencing any desired outcome. Together this implies that everything in reality is exactly how God wanted it a perfect universe free of any flaw although this doesnt address the greater question as once posed by Sister Miriam as to why God would create anything at all given this state of affairs.It does however raise some deeply unanswerable the greatest and most brilliant apologists of all time with decades of academic study and philosophical attainment to aid them have universally failed questions of what the hell God was even sorry for and why anyones getting blamed for anything or nailed to anything.

I think the hostility that a lot of antitheists on reddit show as per the original question of the thread is more than a little unwarranted.

Unlike a Muslim nation who base the laws on religious doctrine. For example in a Muslim nation it would be illegal to eat pork as it is not Halal in Israel you can most definitely eat pork even though it is unkosher. The laws are secular it is called the Jewish state because the country was created as a place for Jews in Diaspora to always know they have a country to go to when in need. So yes being antiIsrael is not necessarily being antiSemitic. Although many many people connect the two and obviously peoples outage with Israel over the Gaza conflict let them feel like this is a good time to just hate all Jews not just Israelis. ,religion,ckgagyi,1,t5_2qh39

2026625,0,t1_ckxczk8,gt Religion often makes claims about the way things are.Something I find interesting about the religion I subscribe to Scientology is that it does this while at the same time saying things like what is true for you is what you have observed for yourself to be true thus putting the subjective experience ahead of what the religion tells you is true. Indeed probably the biggest sin in Scientology is invalidation of anothers experience. But at the same time we have  million words of religious texts telling us the way things are.I think all religions and almost all groups and experiences for that matter in this universe potentially introduce some degree of cognitive dissonance in Scientology it comes from the importance of subjective experience vs. what you get from the books and lectures and trying to figure out which one is right when they dont overlap. You would think it would be easier when we have things specifically telling us that the subjective experience is more important but oddly it doesnt. Perhaps this is largely because of the organizations sometimes overdevotion to L. Ron Hubbard which introduces feelings like if i get something different then it must be my fault because Ron was perfect sort of ideas. for example the whole if god is allPKG then why does evil exist thing in Christianity the whole pro life people are often pro death penalty  and the reverse also being true in american politicsgt Its time religion embraced the value of fiction and imagination and dropped the claims about reality.Id argue that there is no inherent difference between reality and fiction and imagination the difference comes in our willingness to fully perceive something different and our ability to block out all the people telling us that we cant.,religion,ckxfdvd,1,t5_2qh39

2162629,0,t1_clepd9k,Sure. To be succinct and by extension hopefully avoid a huge argument feminism is a perversion of the natural relationship between men and women in the same way that ISIS or fundamentalist clerics amp followers twist Islam into something ugly and malformed. Theyre both radical movements based on hate and the accumulation of power at the expense of everything and everyone else.The Quran says there is no compulsion in religion. Radical Islam says convert or die.Traditional gender roles establish rights amp responsibilities based on the natural strengths and weaknesses of each sex with the idea of producing a balanced society family etc. Feminism produces works like The SCUM Manifesto the stated goal of which is total obliteration of anything male or traditional.Both ideologies seek footholds in culture government education and societal fabric the better to spread their disease. Both movements want to rip apart the natural order citing it as impure or deviant and conveniently something only THEY can fix. At the end of the day radical Islam and feminism are just two kinds of terrorism producing nothing of worth and leaving only fear and agitation and turmoil in their wake. I have no use for either of them.I hope this helps answer your question. Have a good day!,religion,clepx5p,0,t5_2qh39
2166947,0,t3_2jss73,Believe in Jesus is a very tricky phrase. Despite what some folks might suggest that really can mean a lot of different things to different people and it has throughout the  years of Christian experience. Irenaeus was a universalist who believed that Gods love would have the final say.Its very interesting how much trouble some folks seem to have when you take hell away  witness the reaction to Rob Bells Love Wins. The ironic thing is that our understanding of hell is a lot less Bible and a lot more Milton than we think it is.The Bible says a lot of things but we make interpretive decisions and those decisions involve our imposition of our context as well as prior interpretations. I would be careful about assuming that the Bible must say X because some Christian or another said it did. Odds are very high that Christians throughout history have seen that differently regardless of what it is.When I was young I thought that faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God meant cognitive assent to some sort of Christianized version of a Zeus impregnation story. Now I understand that same phrase to mean walking in the way of this human who  in contrast to the powersthatbe  did not try to dominate but instead lived out divine truth. For every argument my young self can give me about why the first interpretation is correct my old self can give a better support for the latter.Sorry so long. TLDR You can be a Christian and think that life is about something other than prepping for some pop quiz that God gives you the moment you die. You can be a Christian and not believe in hell at all no matter what some literalists say.,religion,clf9pky,2,t5_2qh39

But Americans make an exception for Islamism. Criticism of the religioneven in abstractionis conflated with bigotry toward Muslims. There is no public discourse much less an ideological response to Islamism in academia or on Capitol Hill. This trend is creating an intellectual vacuum where poisonous ideas are allowed to propagate unchecked.Thats because people dont know much about Islam in America and this discourse is mostly just bigoted racist nonsense. There is a LOT to criticize in the Middle East and it routinely is. gtYet when I ask why after every terrorist attack the disapproval I get from my nonMuslim peers is visceral The majority of Muslims are not violent they insist the jihadists are a minority who dont represent Islam and I am fearmongering by even wondering aloud.gtThis is delusional thinking. Even as the world witnesses the barbarity of beheadings habitual stoning and severe subjugation of women and minorities in the Muslim world politicians and academics lecture that Islam is a religion of peace.

I dont agree with everything this church teaches though.My personal beliefs Why This Way sums up most of my practical beliefs.  In terms of theology I believe in God but heres where I depart from most modern religion I believe that morality and the idea of right and wrong and the attempt to judge right and wrong is a human phenomenon and is subjective.  It may be an attempt at reaching God but I think it is one that often goes awry and leads people away from God at least the way morality is framed in Western society rightwrong judgment justice etc..  I dont associate God with the idea of justice and this means I dont see justice as the highest purpose or even connected much with higher purposes.  Rather I see justice as an imperfect and subjective human concept that is useful only for practical reasons.I do think there is a sort of order and way of treating people that I associate with God.  I think that love especially unconditional love truth and consistency truthfulness of beliefs consistency of beliefs with each other consistency of beliefs with actions and people working together towards the same goals rather than working against each other are more closely related to the order of God than the idea of justice is.,religion,cmkx2g8,1,t5_2qh39

If we actually lived for everyone else disregarding our own self gains this world would be a lot kinder.  There are going to be tragedys every where you look as that is the nature of rebirth.  The tree dies a seed grows into another tree.  Does the tree feel pain from wind harsh conditions broken limbs when it dies?  We really dont know but we will say no because we are able to view a much bigger picture of the trees growth cycle and why it suffers this harseness.  Perhaps God sees our bigger picture too and doesnt consider the negative in our lives as a negative any more than we see a tree experiencing suffering in its lifetime?  Waking up each morning and taking responsibility for how we feel about something is very important.  If we choose to see the beauty around us then it is the beauty we will notice.  If we let the negatives views in this world become prominent then that is how we will see the world and we will notice more and more negative.  It is what we think and do that makes us who we are.  To allow others actions define ourselves is an act of irresponsibility.  Rise each day and thank God for the day He has given.

It seems that Peter was fixated on men and women as separate and their place in the world.  Jesus was trying to explain when He said the word man that it meant mankind.  I suspect that Peters position on the gospel twisted around what Jesus was trying to teach on those issues.  I like the Book of Thomas as Thomas isnt adding his two cents into the narrative.

2953538,0,t1_co3imn4,Hate to agree with anything Scientology related but you are certainly wrong here. You define true religion as one which shares some of your religious ideals. This is not the case for what is and what is not a religion. A religion is simply a belief structure which deals with the human spirit or soul has beliefs or practices designed to deal with or improve the human soul or spirit and deals with supernatural concepts whether deistic or not. This is why Druidism is a religion as is Wiccan Buddhism Islam Christianity Scientology and Mormonism. You do not need to believe in a deity to be religious. Theism and religious dogma are not required to go together. Do not argue that another religion is not a real religion because it does not believe the same things you do. That is EXACLTY the same as saying women are not REALLY human because they arent a man like me. That black people arent REALLY human because they are white like me. Or that republicans shouldnt be allowed to vote because they dont believe in X or Y political philosophy like I do. This is the reason we have objective neutral definitions for words like religion so to exclude the abililty for one religion to say that OTHER religions arent real religions. The biggest key in any religion is to simply not be a dick. Saying another religion is not a true religion is being a dick in the most basic way possible you are literally insulting their beliefs by saying they dont even qualify as beliefs.,religion,co3txto,4,t5_2qh39

I view religion as a belief some people have regarding ourselves and the universe whereas others see religion as a much more foundational piece of who we are. When I think of the word necessary I think of things that we need to accomplish a particular task whether it be the right ingredients when cooking a casserole basic needs humans require to survive or whatever it takes to go to heaven. In an extremely generalized sense some people believe that religion is necessary due to their religion and others view religion as just another abstract noun that occurs in the universe and holds no necessary purpose in accomplishing any particular task.

Reddits most vocal Jewish population is Orthodox which is why you are receiving the responses above about your child not being considered Jewish. Dont despair! Look into Reform congregations near your home Heres a helpful link  and reach out to one of the clergy members there. Another option is looking for a Reconstructionist congregation but they are much more rare. Your husband may feel more at home there as they tend to have more traditional practices mixed with more liberal views on what is and is not acceptable in the Jewish community. Here is a website to help you find one Im sure that you will find someone willing to talk through this process with you. It is important that you dont get discouraged by the voices who are attempting to exclude you  there are just as many if not more inclusive voices. I grew up with a family with a Jewish father and Catholic mother. There were  children in the family and they attended religious school at the synagogue Jewish camp and were fully Jewishly literate. Im not sure what their connection to Catholicism was but I do know that they were fully accepted by my Jewish community. Also keep in mind that one person does not speak for the whole movement.

3851361,0,t1_cqv4b9a,The laws and prohibitions in the Old Testament that you mentioned I am well aware of and some of them had clear reasons given for them. Like the one prohibiting a baby lamb from being boiled in it own mothers milk was a obvious justice issue since the milk was what normally fed and nourished the lamb. The prohibition on some animals like pork make sense to us today since we know how risky it is to eat pork that is under cooked but the bible just said it was unclean. It is interesting to note that at the end of the flood when Noah was told by God that he could use animals for food no restriction was made Geneisis  so perhaps the restriction was for another reason. Other issues are not so clear like the man committing rape being alowed to Marry the woman perhaps this was more a case of a couple who were already seeing each other and was a lesser type of crime because of that. Other accounts in the Old Testament put rape in a very negative light in fact the same law covenant had rules that forbid any sexual relations during war  so even women from other nations Who were captured were protected from rape.  Samuel  Even the tribe of Benjamin was almost wiped out because of a gang rape. I dont believe we can understand fully the laws from that time any more than they could understand why OJ Simpson got away with murder. We may not agree but we do understand  the outcome of that trial today and the way the justice system works. Personally I could speculate that God provided compromise for the nation based on the norm of that time but that is not something I really have enough facts to stand on. The New Testament states that the laws of that time were to lead to a perfect law and to Christ and that those laws were done away with at Jesus death so on a personal bases I wouldnt  feel under any obligation to follow the law covenant today even if I was Jewish. Having said that I do look at the law to gain insight in to how God feels about things and his ability to train a primitive nation through that law covenant.In fact that Law Covenant made the Nation Gods Nation or a holy Nation so some of the laws no doubt were for that reason to set them apart from all other people of that time.    ,religion,cqvags1,3,t5_2qh39

Second of all dont be afraid of death its nothing to be frightened of. The idea of eternal judgement scares a lot of people because they incorrectly believe that the Christian God is one of wrath instead of one of mercy. God loves you. He does. Youre precious to Him and if you werent in Heaven with Him when you die He would be sad. Im convinced truly that God would never condemn anyone to hell unless they wanted to go there unless they actively denied Him and His love. But it sounds like you want it and thats awesome because He wants to give it to you too. And I promise this isnt a shameless plug but I had a very similar conversation with my cousin who was worried he wouldnt go to heaven and it inspired me to write this for him on my personal blog If youre willing to read it I think it might help calm your fears about dying and help you trust in a God who loves you.

They affirm Jesus to be a man and the founder of their religion.  Jesus a man created a covenant in like manner to other prophets Adam Noah Abraham.  Their relationship with God is through the covenant formulated between God and Jesus.  The covenant that began with Jesus is a fulfillment of the previous covenant.  Christadelphians hope to created a brotherhood of worshippers.  In addition to denying the Trinity they reject the literal personage of Satan.  They also commonly deny the absolute immortality of the soul Hell and that one is saved through faith without works.  They also affirm pacifism.Unitarian Universalism  Unitarian Universalism is a coming together of two doctrines.  Unitarians are those who deny the Trinity and affirm a unified nature of the Divine.  Universalists are those who affirm that eventually all will be restored to right standing with God or that all paths can come to God.  Modern Unitarian Universalists affirm no solid creed.  They are believers on different paths who come together in peace to worship whatever higher power there may be.  Unitarian Universalism is a liberal religious tradition that grew out of Christianity and many practitioners affirm some Christian ideas.  A significant influence on the religion was American Deism.AmericanChristian Deism  Deism is not a religion but a philosophic stance on the nature of God.  Deism can best be summed up as a belief in a God who walked away.  God the Creator establishes Creation.  He sets it in motion.  He then ceases to interact with it.  Historically Deism and Atheism were more or less synonymous.  Deism has had a profound influence on the United States.  Many intellectuals in Early America embraced Christian Deism.  They held that God established the world with innate and sensible laws but He then ceased to interact with the world.  Miracles as such were rejected.  Jesus and the Hebrew Bible were held to be a great moral teachings.  Natures God The Heretical Origins of the American Republic is specifically devoted to this subject.  Of our key Founding Fathers the majority were influenced by Deistic thinking or Theistic rationalism.  This includes George Washington John Adams Unitarian Benjamin Franklin James Madison Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson see Jefferson Bible  There is a debate as to what precisely these men were religiously.  It is certain that they were influenced by Christian Deism.  It might be better to state that they felt reason and revelation both pointed to the same God just with reason being the superior path to Him.

6940910,0,t3_4apsyi,Not a Muslim here.Quran .  Heres how I interpret this  the Prophets hold multiple stations.  One is the physical station of their being on earth.  Another is a spiritual stations which has existed for all eternity and will continue to exist for all eternity.  E.g. I am the Alpha and the Omega the First and the Last the Beginning and the End..  The physical body knows death but their spiritual station does not.  Christ was crucified on the cross but this is only the end of the physical body.  This interpretation is also supported by other translations.  For example Yusuf Ali frequently wellregarded by Muslims hasgt That they said in boast We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary the Messenger of Allah but they killed him not nor crucified him but so it was made to appear to them and those who differ therein are full of doubts with no certain knowledge but only conjecture to follow for of a surety they killed him notLook at other translations too.  Most of them read more like this one.  A few of them suggest this terminology of an alternate took Christs place this really doesnt stand up to reason at all.  When the verses of the Quran or the Bible dont make sense literally its better to reason about what the possible metaphorical explanations were.Quran  This relates really deeply to one of the fundamental Bahai teachings that man must not evaluate Gods word with mans own standard.  The Christians have interpreted the Bible in so many ways since the time of Christ.  The doctrine of the trinity for example isnt established in the Bible it was established at the council of Nicaea to unite the Christians.  Since then Christianity has splintered into many sects each with their own interpretation of the Bible.  The text itself has not been corrupted at least not in any significant way but the meaning of the same words has changed greatly over the years.This Quranic verse is saying that if you look at the Bible with a pure eye and without adding the dogma and interpretations that have become prevalent since then the Gospels will confirm the Quran.  The Quran and the utterances of Christ come from the same source.  These arent two religions of two Gods these are one religion of one God.  The contradictions come from the interpretations humans have added not the texts themselves.In general I find the original argument dull and untruthful.  It removes the context of these verses.  One can always interpret the Bible with the intention of contradicting the Quran.  If you assume they contradict each other you will always succeed in arguing for a contradiction  its really an easy academic exercise.  This is because both the Quran and the Bible have both literal and metaphorical meanings and its easy to mix them up.  The Quran says its confirmed by the Bible and so to reasonably evaluate the Quran we need to be willing to assume this.  Its far more interesting is to view the Quran and the Bible as telling different aspects of the same story.  Its more challenging and more rewarding.,religion,d132xxu,2,t5_2qh39

I used the word kid in an illustrative way but if you took offense I apologize. If bitter isnt an appropriate word to describe your demenour then youll have to forgive my lack of a better adjective. Im not dodging your allegations but feel that Ive handled the points rather well but I could be wrong. Youre upset that Jehovahs witnesses follow what the bible says even if you disagree with it correct? As I stated your issue should t be with us or our organization but with the Bible because thats where we draw our beliefs from. But you neglect to show me from the bible how any of our beliefs are wrong. I dont disagree with what the organization has put out in regards to these topics but take issue with the fact that you take snips of certain articles that you feel validate your point. What you fail to realize is that I dont worship the governing body I dont serve the organization. I worship and serve Jehovah God alone.

This being my inaugural opinion in this subreddit Ill give the full disclosure right up front Im a born n raised mormon from long mormon roots on both sides.  Im still a firm believer in it and at the same time a very lessactive member.  Not proud of it but havent been to church in years.Firstly I agree with the spirit of your question. Religion has had ALLLLLL sorts of awful acts attributed to it. But I think its important to remember that this is just an excuse for evil people to justify bad acts.  That said dont forget that one of the basic points of religion is to create a support group of sorts for like minded people to help each other perfect themselves according to their own framework. Were all trying to help each other be better people. Speaking only for myself my religion is so ingrained in who I am that I cannot accept the idea of giving it up or switching to a different one. Just saying do away with it is just not possible for people like me.  Thankfully I know right fron wrong and Im not willing to commit evil justified by anything.If I was told that I must abandon my religion for whatever reason I would probably end up one of those people arrested for practicing it in secret even though I dont actively practice now.I know it probably sounds highly contradictory and hypocritical. I just wanted to express what kind of cord your question struck with me.  The point is that for better or worse my religion has influenced so many of my views and beliefs that giving it up is analogous to asking me to switch races. It just aint gonna happen.Feel free to ask away. Wont respond to tolls. ,religion,d49jym7,2,t5_2qh39

There are countless definitions proposed by different scholars legal regimes religious communities cultural perspectives dictionaries and encyclopedias etc. in various contexts but once you start to seriously look into them you quickly realize that there never is and never has been anything approaching a consensus on what religion is. This essay which appears in Critical Terms for Religious Studies a sort of encyclopedia of key concepts for the field is a bit long but does a great job of illustrating this point historically. The fundamental point is that religion isnt a natural kind or a uniformly deployed category its a secondorder classification that is constantly being reimagined according to different interests and assumptions. ,religion,d6lhmdy,1,t5_2qh39

This is much like your belief. The only difference is that Christians believe that Jesus sacrifice needed to be made in order to fulfill justice. I cant truly answer for those who believe that you only need faith or that everyone will be saved but I think they still strive to do good as a way of thanking God and spreading His love and peace. I think its viewed as a duty of the faithful in order to do good.EDIT you might also want to ask your question to the folks at  rChristianity.  ,religion,d789krl,7,t5_2qh39

So when someone is out of harmony acting violently being hateful disrespecting the gifts given to humanity or that person there are consequences to that.  Those consequences on Earth may be felt by that person but have practical consequences for that persons community.

They are told to fear foreigners whether its for committing acts of terrorism or weakening their economy or whatever else. This isnt unique to America the same thing happens in other countries when people get desperate and the economy tanks. Its always everyone elses fault because thats easier than selfexamination and admitting that perhaps an entire system is faulty.  People are directed to blame outsiders hate groups are on the rise. Hell Greece saw a resurgence of neoNazism. Trump like other politicians because he is not unique puts an easy face to complex problems and these faces are usually unAmerican.And while I can understand this shift we should also call a spade a spade. We seemingly have no problem doing this with countries other than our own.  Whether driven by desperation or tribalism my party vs. your party Trump will root out Democratic corruption blah blah blah or ignorance the end result is the same all their fears converge on the other whichever scapegoat that ends up being.

9400796,0,t3_59a948,I am doubtful of the value in conversions a man is born into a tradition and by being exposed to its many different layers during his different stages of mental emotional and most importantly spiritual development he becomes fully immersed into that tradition. Of course conversions happen and they are usually celebrated by the community as a form of valued external validation but they rarely succeed in providing the person with spiritual salvation because faith is not a fashion item one simply chooses. Any sort of conversion to succeed you must keep several things in mind first you must treat yourself as an initiate not a full member. Some religions like Islam or many of the modern sects of Christianity end or begin at conversion you are a full member after joining saying the shahada or getting baptized or what have you. This is problematic for modern men separated from all spirituality simply knowing a religion is inadequate one must master the faith through rigorous practice and constant contemplation decades is needed until you can rightly consider yourself a believer after you have believed AND had that belief tested and tried. Your transition from an initiate to a full member must go through becoming a believer becoming a practitioner and staying a believer and a practitioner until your faith is tested by a major trial in whatever form it presents itself. Secondly you must know what does a proper faith provides its followers with a religion making sense means a religion being able to meet these minimum requirements a strong differentiated sense of community where all are not equal and the faithful are superior in the eyes of God to the unfaithful there is an established holy hierarchy. The proper faith must have a clear notion of good and evil with clear instructions for you to follow good and reject evil you must reject evil and it is not good enough to know and follow good these are complimentary. There must be a practice involved sola fide is evil incarnate not only your faith must be accompanied by good deeds but the faith itself must become manifest in something doable. Islamic Salat the developed system of meditation or confession are very good examples of religious practice. And finally good religions also have central figures of authority that are considered to be the absolute holiest among the believers in the absence of such a position religions go insane with a sort of holiness escalation and spiral into pure insanity the inclination of demonstrating our commitment to a cause that has brought us a shared sense of identity is an innate one and I will claim a holier than thou attitude if there isnt a holiest figure to stop my descent into hell a la Protestant Christianity or Sunnis Islam where the pursuit of Im holier than you has reached in the rejection of God itself as not holy enough in the former and a bloody war over whos holier in the latter. ,religion,d97m7lv,3,t5_2qh39
9421020,0,t3_59m7d1,Im going to answer this differently than the others have so far.Theres no official stance on what any particular phrase means.  Every person Bah or not is free to interpret Bahullhs teachings for themselves.  Theres no standard explanation thats authoritative.  In fact even the phrase unification of religion doesnt often appear in the Bah writings.  Its a phrase some people use to explain their interpretations.  At least if I search bahai.orglibrary for unification of religion in quotes I get  hits.  Of course its a common theme but we cant rely on this particular phrasing.In fact I completely disagree with the statement that all religious people worship the same God.   Clearly different people have different understandings of what God is or isnt.  Youve nicely disproved it in your post.A theme I see in the writings is that whoever makes an earnest and committed search after religious truth  whoever they are however they do it  ultimately makes progress in doing so    There are many different paths some corresponding to organized religions and others that dont and no path is fundamentally right or wrong.When we look at how the Bahai Writings talk about God we see that ultimately it wont fit into any conceptual frameworkgt The invisible realm of the Divinity is sanctified and exalted above the comprehension of all beings and all that can be imagined is mere human understanding. The power of human understanding does not encompass the reality of the divine Essence All that man can hope to achieve is to comprehend the attributes of the Divinity the light of which is manifest and resplendent in the world and within the souls of men.Given this we can still try to conceptualize the ultimate reality.  We have an Abrahamic conceptualization characterized by the appearance of the Manifestations of God and the worship of one God.  However we can also conceptualize God as a supreme animating force or spirit that interconnects all beings.  We need not think of God as personified.  We can think of God as constantly interacting with the world or think of God as entirely sanctified and aloof from it.  We cant even really say that God is one rather than plural or none to begin withgt The Divine Reality which is purified and sanctified from the understanding of human beings and which can never be imagined by the people of wisdom and of intelligence is exempt from all conception. ...The Divine Reality is sanctified from singleness then how much more from plurality.Bahs are most comfortable with the conceptualization of God sending Manifestations of God to reveal religion.  However theres lots of trickiness here too.  The Bah Writings frequently quote a Hadith that reads Knowledge is a light which God casteth into the heart of whomsoever He willeth.  If God is an invisible essence or a spiritual force then revelation can be a much more accessible concept rather than one confined only to an Abrahamic perspective. Ive had a few friends who have come from Hindu backgrounds study the Faith and they tell me they find many of the Eastern religious concepts expressed in the Bahai Writings as well.  I think a major obstacle for the Bahai community is that many of us come from Abrahamic backgrounds and so we including myself dont even know that the Bahai Writings are actually very meaningful for a nonAbrahamic audience.What I might get from the teachings is probably very different from what you might derive.Ultimately thoughgt The purpose of religion ... is to establish unity and concord amongst the peoples of the world make it not the cause of dissension and strife.Religious communities have had especially in the past a great unifying influence.  Now the purpose of religion is to go even further and unify different religions together.  This doesnt mean a onesize fits all explanation but rather that we can learn to be loving and understanding of a great variety of viewpoints.  The recognition that all mankind is one regardless of our individual beliefs is the building block for a world civilization.  Thats what I think about when I hear unification of religion  not that all religions will think the same way but that we all accept one another and have a framework of knowledge that allows us to do so in a meaningful way that transcends mere wishful thinking.,religion,d9a6gpr,3,t5_2qh39

10313105,0,t3_5nhlhz,Howdy! I believe that Jesus Christ was the Son of God or eternal part of the one God that is Three in One the Trinity. What might be interesting is that I have whole hearted faith in the said Three in One God but the ability to explain what the Trinity actually is escapes me. I cant understand it but I also believe that it cannot be understood in this lifetime and is not meant to be until post death or what some Eastern Religions might call enlightenment which would occur on our mortal plane. This is the introduction to faith. I have a lot of background in my own upbringing and this is a cause for a lack of credibility. But I have stood on both sides of belief and nonbelief and my internal convictions wherever it is they come from drove me to the faith I have. To me faith is believing yet being at peace with that which we cannot understand. The quote Seeing isnt believing believing is seeing. Comes to mind. If I knew everything about the creator there would be no reason for this faith but I believe the life that live on Earth is a journey of faith at its basic levels. Faith is a necessity to reach Heaven or nirvana or enlightenment. It is our purpose.,religion,dcd1oxd,1,t5_2qh39

10402956,0,t1_dcn5z3g,Interesting thats a really well thought out answer and I appreciate your perspective. I came from a very staunchly Christian background I no longer believe in any of it  perhaps in part because it had to be all or nothing and almost every Christian I know was  is of the mindset that the bible HAS to be the literal word of God. The old if part of it isnt true then none of it can be mindset. The interesting thing here is that my dad  a pastor with a PHD in biblical hermeneutics from a very good university  is one of the deepest proponents of this idea in my life. So I definitely think I have a somewhat skewed perspective. But because of that I have a hard time seeing how anyone could believe in the gray area of Christianity... if you dont believe Jesus is the son of God and that he rose from the dead... then it all just falls apart? Sorry not a really a question for you more just an attempt to collect my scattered thoughts! Thanks for engaging in debate with me  ,religion,dcn8q34,1,t5_2qh39

I dont think there will ever be a time when you can get logical assumptions about God from science i.e. if you get scientific evidences it is no longer a question of faith but of knowledge. I dont believe in the logical path of Descartes of anythinh alike I think so I am I am so God is So I think that whats happening here is what the Church has done for a long time There is no possible way evolution could exist says an ancient pope but then the wise people of that time say Your Holiness as a matter of fact we can no longer deny it without making a fool out of ourselves. They struggle for some time but then So there is evolution because that is God plan!So I think the Church tries to stick to its views and then when we know it wont be good for us if we stick to them we start making assumptions about Gods plan or Gods requirement. I think the Church should and has to promote scientific development but avoid making assumptions about it. Science needs religion to get even more wonderful and religion needs science to evolve and to get informed about the world and the creation of God. But I dont think they should ever mix Give back to Caesar what is Caesars and to God what is Gods.Apart from this I cannot answer you as I dont believe there are dogmas...

It seems that religion came about to answer early mans questions about the unknown world around them which may be so but what made them start to ask those questions when all other creatures do not? Perhaps the more advanced among them learned that by instilling those questions into others and to also have the answers was a very powerful thing...and power brought much.

Not that I cant believe his transformation... but rather that anything he says was impeccable from that moment on.This is a very good question. There are also lots of questions about the Bibles authenticity and whether it has been corrupted. In Islam we believe in Christ but we also believe that his teachings were corrupted for the reasons you mention.
