But...the glass under the pot is always hot. Gas on glass. You dont ever come into contact with the glass as there are grills above the glass. So...when sometime boils over or spills it just lands on a non hot glass of which you wipe up later. Smart. ,BeAmazed,ct79g1i,2,t5_363r3

When this happened the city started to die but soon there were diamonds discovered farther north but Yellowknife was already a hub as its a capital city with an airport and a highway from the south. The people who lost their jobs in the gold mines quickly got jobs in the diamond mine because of mine experience and affirmative action. The diamonds from the Northwest Territories are desirable because they arent considered blood diamonds as their African counterparts. Theyre laser inscribed with symbols and serial numbers. Here are a couple of the mines   Ive been to the de beers diamond mine which is the closest to Yellowknife and I have flown over the other two in the wiki links. But you are right there is still gold exploration and Ive done some work at a couple of camps. Im not going to edit to be honest so sorry for any rambling and how long I went.
