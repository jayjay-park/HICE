The play store takes a while to update but if you have signed up for the beta it should be available within the next two hours.FYI the bottom of the Retire page does not look very good right now even by our standards with the addition of the backup and restore buttons.  We are looking into that.,IdleOilTycoon,ckl5572,1,t5_33i4t

2481102,0,t1_cmick0s,Im just about at EYYYYY xp so perhaps I can give you some pointers. Hold off on retiring as long as youre still able to upgrade your income every  hour cycle. Assuming youre only getting one upgrade per  hours youll quadruple your xp every time. As you get later into the game and the negotiator has a larger impact it takes around two days to get back to where you were before resetting so you want to take that into account before you do. At that it takes me  days to get back to where I was when my xp is  what it was before. Edit didnt even check the username whoops. ,IdleOilTycoon,cmif2pe,1,t5_33i4t

3637680,0,t1_cq39td6,Thanks for the nice analysis. I think you neglect the fact that youre also purchasing levels of the properties not just accruing them for free from the IA. So in . days you expect to get more than one power of . or . for GR and SF respectively. And even though SF is cheaper than GR the multiplier for GR is proportionally larger than for SF and outweighs this difference.,IdleOilTycoon,cq6x8d3,1,t5_33i4t
