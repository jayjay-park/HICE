316639,0,t1_cfdjwos,Basically what it comes down to is thisWhen Forge was first becoming a thing some of the devs approached Flowerchild the dev of BTW about why he wasnt switching over to Forge. He replied that he had his reasons and didnt care to share them or something to that effect. Anyways it would have all stopped there if a little thing called Better With Forge hadnt popped up. It was a complete and unapologetic ripoff of BTW and a number of people including Flowerchild were convinced that it was directly supported by several Forge devs. They saw it as Forge saying comply and use Forge or well just rip off your mod anyways. You can see why this was considered problematic.Anyways it was a bit of a thing and to this day BTW now prides itself on being incompatible with everything as a result.Important bit is the bad feels that left with a lot of modders at the time. Forge didnt win itself too many new friends that day. Im among those who hold a grudge.Also not sure why you guys cant find anything about this. A quick google search turned up several forum threads on the topic.,ModdingMC,cfdl7iq,0,t5_2syjc

4372479,0,t3_3a8w1l,Some old versions of forge did not have forge mod loader so instead of mods folder you drop them in minecraft.jar and delete MetaInf.You will probably need the old classic launcher before profilesDid you find the old aether forum post on minecraftforums?,ModdingMC,csiii8i,1,t5_2syjc
7397464,0,t1_d2iiik3,Well if thats all you want then CodeChickenCore should do the trick.  Install the mod open up the config and set finiteWater to true.,ModdingMC,d2j1k5d,2,t5_2syjc
7908917,0,t1_d450920,Oh THAT. That is quite convoluted and totally unexplained.It is also not the point. Ok I can use wget thats good.The problem still remains that the only method of support I can actually afford is currently suspect of being a virus infested scamfest.I thought I was being helpful and I got heavily punished for it.If anything I at least want it to be known to as many people as possible that adfocus is probably dangerous and they should not use it.If in the process I also get it out there that Lex is being a dick about it well thats his own doing but I wont complain.,ModdingMC,d451cme,1,t5_2syjc
