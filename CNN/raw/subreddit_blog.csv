447891,0,t3_1z73wr,This is absolutely fantastic news as it is in keeping with the reddit I signed up for many a moon ago a reddit that doesnt just talk about caring about a sense of community but one that puts its money where its mouth is. Ive always loved how the admins seem to cherish that facet of this site and encourage its users to help worthy causes.For example The story of Omari and the orphanage You can read an update to that after this story became known as the Great Wall of Reddit here When a little girl with Huntingtons disease was being bullied by neighbors reddit had her back After a child with cancer jokingly plead for pizza reddit stepped up Before Seth Rogan brought the cause back into our collective consciousness this week with his testimony before Congress reddit helped raise over k for the Alzheimers Association thanks to Samuel L. Jacksons AMAAs stated those are just a few of the great things individual redditors have done to raise money for worthy causes. Whether its building a wall to protect children half a world away helping fund research into devastating diseases raising money for schools or simply providing a rrandomactsofpizza redditors have never failed to impress me in their zeal to affect real tangible change for real tangible people in the world. And the admins have always supported it which is a testament to how in touch they are with their site and its users.Now have we been suckered sometimes? Sure. I wont list any examples here because shame on them! but Id be remiss not to remind everyone to always trust but verify before contributing to causes that seem noble. However by and large I think most redditors are good hearted people. The trolls tend to live short lives on here while people with sincere motives stick around. Time and again its been proven that the good outlives the bad the trolls delete their accounts while the wellnatured thrive. With all that said my hope is that when the time comes for nominations of worthy charities we keep the community spirit in mind. Which is to say that we focus on charities that help real people who are in dire need rather than large groups that are already well funded. I urge all redditors to look into local nonprofits in their own backyard between now and the end of the year find some that are doing some good solid work helping real people and prepare your argument for them. Why? Because anyone can post a link to the EFF and probably get tons of upvotes because yes its a worthy cause and yes reddit loves such orgs. But I think itd be a wasted opportunity to focus only on causes that are already well funded when so many community based realpeopleaffecting charities out there are so often overlooked.Thanks again to the admins for doing this. The best way to thank them though is to take some time this year to research nonprofits that usually fly under the radar nonprofits that directly impact people in positive ways and be ready to argue our case when nomination season arrives.,blog,cfr6t1m,6,t5_2qh49

Maybe you watched a report about upskirt laws on the local news and certain subreddits come up. You go to the site and on the front page there could be a bunch of really sexistracist memes. There could be a majority of postings and comments that skew extremely male almost exclusively. Maybe youre pretty inclined to agree with that lady on the news that said reddit is a sea of mysogony and perverts. You dont explore deeper. You dont sign up and make the site your own by subscribing to niche subreddits. You nope the fuck out of there and never return. Clearly the mods are hoping to combat a bit of this by defaulting new subs and kicking others off the list.

Men do need a safe space because a lot of men that want to talk about mens issues get scoffed at derided or even laughed at by other men.Is TwoX really a safe space? Judging by what gets on the front page it just looks like it appeals even to a limited subset of women not even women in general.By saying the rest of reddit already caters to men kind of misses the point here. All of the defaults which is for all intents and purposes to most reddit cater to everyone save for TwoX. Reddit itself previously didnt directly cater to men. The users with their upvotes and downvotes decided what content hit the front page. At that point its a simple number game of who votes more which I wonder if theres numbers on that.The subreddits you have to find for yourself or even make could definitely cater more towards a male demographic but those are hardly what everyone sees on a regular basis.As I said rAskWomen  and raskmen would have been better choices to represent women and men on reddit.,blog,chchnes,-2,t5_2qh49

955050,0,t1_chcntpx,Ok Ill give it one last try.No I do not agree because love is what gives marriage by its modern post th century definition its weight.Meaning that while both homosexuals and heterosexuals can marry people of the opposite sex the meaning is entirely different. Under current laws heterosexuals get to fulfil the purpose of marriage homosexuals dont. That is not equal treatment and the fact that the law doesnt mention love doesnt change that.Its comparable to the separate but equal doctrine of the last century. The law back then never said that black schools had to be worse than white schools or that black students had to travel further to get to them. But those where nonetheless the results of those laws and thus the supreme court declared them in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.,blog,chcuiwa,1,t5_2qh49

991894,0,t1_chh0fhj,While I think its excellent these regulations are fought one by one including minute actions which en masse can have great effect people also always need to realize the source of the problem corruption due to the way politics are financed in the US. This is not an abstract concept like money corrupts everything yes sure but thats why its illegal for say a cop to accept a bribe. Rather there is a specific framework of campaign financing in the US which enables this corruption It requires politicians who want to be successful to spend a big portion of their time running after donors  theyre campaigning in a green phase preceding the actual campaign  which in turn will have them evolve a sixth sense on how to please those donors. Consider how FCCs Tom Wheeler raised half a million for the Obama campaigns and even though he was a cable companies lobbyist was then put into the seat by Obama... despite Obama having promised people hell stand up for net neutrality. It turns democracy into an oligarchy a state run by the rich where laws being created will fit deeppocket corporations instead of you the citizens.

992321,0,t1_chh0z0t,On an individual level this is fine. Services like Skype prioritize audio over video. You can also configure your home router to prioritize certain kinds of traffic to prevent things like Windows updates from slowing down that movie your watching on Netflix. The difference is that this is done client side not by the ISP.I would not be ok with the ISPs doing this. Comcast has already gotten in trouble with the FCC for throttling specific kinds of traffic PPBittorrent. It is too hard to seperate the type of traffic from the service providing it. Providers like Comcast could easily throttle all video traffic in order to encourage people to use their cable service. Since the vast majority of this traffic is Netflix that could be seen as discriminating against a specific service.Also if your traffic is encryptedanonymized which is becoming increasingly popular after the NSA fiasco nobody can tell what the hell it is. This may thwart their efforts or they might just deprioritize all encrypted traffic under the assumption that you are up to something nefarious.,blog,chh31fx,1,t5_2qh49

The motivation doesnt matter.  As you said we have had some really great AMAs where the person was promoting something and also some really terrible ones. So it is clear that the promotion doesnt really have an impact on the quality.What is more important to us is trying to get the person to stick around and answer in detail instead of just popping in to answer some softballs and then leaving.

Greenwald was open and honest about errors in the PRISM story both on his account and from places like WaPo. And I think his point stands  regardless of the error which I agree are important the impact of the story remains unchanged.And the analogy was meant to show the difference between going about typical business practices and actively causing harm to the country andor business institutions. Theres a difference between codebreaking and secretly compromising the security and infrastructure of Google.

A cross as a memorial isnt promoting christianity any more than a science museum is promoting atheism.

Im not impervious to having my mind changed. You can actually make a difference here!As for your linked article Im not going to pretend I understand all of the math and I dont expect you will either. What I do understand is the premise which is that money input relates to a definitive number of babies or antelopes saved I understand this is meant as an analogy and it can apply to other concepts like breast cancer awareness VS. native american issues.

Theyre perfectly within their rights to go full nerf if they want. They can even implement word filters so you cant explicitly curse. Frankly I would not blame them for using their ever growing staff to start to snipe the worst offenders.People have come to think of reddit as their own personal blog.

I was sectionhiking the long trail with my brother and we decided to end our leg for the year...so we walked out into rural nowhere Vermont and hitchhiked our way to a trailer park to spend the night and wait for a ride home. The trailer park was midcelebration of their Christmas in July event  everyone had decorations and lawn ornaments and there was a giant fake santa in a snowglobe with fake snow blowing around. I think it was something they did regularly as someone mentioned a tropical theme coming up.Kind of surreal to see a bunch of backwoods people with their kids with candycane fencing to the streamline in the middle of July.

The owner can dictate who is and isnt allowed. In fact Reddit is worse because they dont tell you to leave  they actually delete your words as if they were never spoken. Much worse than being asked to leave a residence.The only solution would be to create a truly public government sponsored forum for online debate that wouldnt require advertisements or to change the law and force Reddit to act as a public forum instead of a place of business which it isnt.,blog,csgf8lp,-3,t5_2qh49

10553417,0,t3_5r43td,Mormons arent super popular on Reddit but I feel like its important to share  My ancestors came to the US seeking the same freedoms that we have enshrined in our ideology as Americans. However because they were different and because people were scared of them sound familiar? they were driven out of their homes. We call them the pioneers now but in reality they were religious refugees who were explicitly unwelcome in a place they had called home. I would not wish that on anyone. The United States has a checkered past full of peaks and valleys but the minute we openly deny ideals that we once held so dear we devalue ourselves and everything our forefathers worked so hard to build. ,blog,dd4ck5o,5,t5_2qh49

Weve got a long lineage of great people in the family my grandpa working the railroad while my grandmother was stay at home mom of  scattering about the east coast from our most Southern tip all the way up to the northeast.  Im now going to copy and paste an excerpt from somebody elses submission to this thread that has nothing to do with me but it is going to make this story longer and this will get upvoted anyways from some liberal fucks that only read the first  sentences and figure it supports the narrative.  I apologize to the person who wrote this for using it. Because of this he was eventually seen as an obstacle and targeted. He lived in Batangas and other PNP personel tried and failed to kill him in a road block. Luckily he survived because their aim sucks and he always drove with a hand canon next to him I remember that gun he let me shoot it one day  it was not easy.  That was the last straw he decided to immigrate where he had officer training West Point officers in the PNP often sent their officers for training back in the day. He told my mom that she should go first along with my sisters he was scared that they would target her and my siblings next. He managed to convince someone to let them leave the country under false pretenses. She was a nurse and found an apartment in Middletown NY next to the nursing home she found work in. She eventually applied for and got permanent residence.  Our first family home was in trailer park now gone. I remember we bought for  dollars at the time. Compared from where we came from it was a mansion.  We came a year or two later. He had to finish things. I remember living with relatives prior to coming to the US. I hated the US at first I left everything I knew. My father was bitter. He was a patriotic filipino he had to leave.  I eventually fell in love with country. I remember pledging in NYC I did it the same time my mother did. My younger sisters go automatic citizenship because they were minors I was  at the time. Like many things I took it for granted.

Human beings are social animals and for most of our history we actually lived more or less communistically. That fact is often glossed over but it was the status quo more or less until the industrial revolution. People arent altruistic but they develop structures that encourage mutual respect and cooperation because it benefits both parties. This is ironically the same thing free market capitalism preaches.

10559117,0,t3_5r43td,My parents and I are all immigrants to the United States. Initially as legal residents and now US Citizens.My father was born in a small town in Peru. At  years of age he left for the United States. He arrived to Los Angeles and settled into odd jobs as a baker commercial painter and a mechanic. That all changed when the draft board contacted him for military service. This was the reason he became angry at me when it was my time to wear the uniform. His option was go back to Peru or serve. He knew he wanted to make his life here. He made his choice and year later he found himself in Vietnam. He served one tour. He will not speak of it.Upon completion of military service he took the money from the GI bill and enrolled in the top dental school in Mexico where the tuition was less and the classes were in his native tongue. After graduation he met my mother when she was a student and he was an instructor.They married and I was born. In Mexico. My father then took his young family back to the United States.My father became a US citizen shortly after. One of my favorite stories is when he was answering the verbal citizenship questions and they asked Will you defend this nation against enemies foreign and domestic his answer was I already did. The interviewer wasnt pleased.My father passed the medical board exams and was able to begin his private practice. Where he still practices today almost  years later. My mothers initial English was poor and did not pass the exams. Following the birth of my three other siblings those plans to practice were later postponed and then set aside.I grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles. All of my extended family immigrated from Mexico or South America. They all became citizens. Their children were born citizens.My family has engineers teachers military PhDs cops and so many people that contribute to society. We are American first.

Now were rescinding the deal including for people who already are helping us with the understanding that we would hold up our end.Now who the hell is going to help us knowing that at any point we might pull the rug out from under them and say ha ha too bad leaving them there to be murdered by some kid who idolized the local warlord we just ousted or whatever.

10645495,0,t1_ddb6uzs,gtThe same people who pointed out how were all the same was bullshit a position now accepted by social justice circles  were likewise shouted down as being unworthy of debate for the very same reasons youre saying now even though their position was eventually accepted by the very same people who said they shouldnt be debated because racism.Its actually quite interesting and not nearly as straight forward as youre making it out to be. If youre interested in it I would be happy to provide some reading material about how the were all the same ideals of social justice were taken down from the inside by marginalized groups that were asserting control of the narrative against wellmeaning mainly white female feminists. Bruno Latour wrote about multiple modes of existence but even before that it was a strong dialogue occurring in social justice for awhile with the critique that success of racist movements was over their recognition of tangible differences between groups. Heck W.E.B. DuBois even touched on this kind of thing in The Souls of Black Folk in .gtFlatEarthers and  Truthers spectacularly discredit themselves in any debate. Theyre instantly reduced to absurdity. Debate is the best possible thing to marginalize them on nothing more than the basis of their own beliefs as articulated by the very best of their believers.Okay I think I recognize where there is a difference here.I believe you are putting an extremely strong emphasis on the impacts debate has. I could run intellectual circles around a flatearther all goddamn day but it wont make them change their mind. I could tear down every point they have and it would never make a dent in their ideology. They are bad ideas and are mindguarded against any possible change. Whats the point of trying then? Youre punching pudding. Yeah the pudding moves when you punch it but its still just going to be a pile of pudding!gtHolocaust Denial is interesting. Does that not deserve any debate?Whether the holocaust happened does not deserve debate. Debate over how when and the actual figures of it is something that occurs frequently and is completely normal. Its a small difference but again talking about howwhythe numbers of things that have happened is completely different from questioning the actual existence of it. This is a point people get confused about with climate change denial. The climate is changing. Asking how whats impacting it the most etc. isnt bad and are important questions to ask and are good science. Denying it is happening at all however is at this point patently absurd and again anyone who believes it isnt happening likely is not going to be one that you could change the mind of.gtThe reason you wouldnt debate holocaust denial is because youd wind up losing.No and it is extremely offensive and poor taste to project meaning and purpose to another persons actions. If all the evidence we have up to this point cannot prove to a person that the holocaust happened not how when how many people etc. there is no way you could change that persons mind and you would absolutely be wasting your time attempting to do so.gtSame goes for a lot of issues about race which is why you demand no discussion or debate. Im a quantitative sociologist buddy are you seriously going to be projecting this kind of thing on me? I ask the unpopular questions all the time lmaogtNobody demands flatearthers or  truthers be silent. Science is willing to put them down with great vigor and indeed routinely does. Science encourages them to step out into the light to stand as example of what scientific illiteracy looks like. Science doesnt fear their position.No they pretty frequently get shouted down when they come up and are mocked hilariously. Science is willing to put them down as though science is a homogeneous body? I really dont understand what youre saying here it sounds like you think science is an entity that acts in a coordinated fashion and I find it hilarious you think a flatearther could be argued out of their position with science. I take that to mean youve never spoken to one before and dont understand the depths of their passion for this movement goes.gtOn this issue the reason you fear debate is because debate is what reveals how weak your position is how its enforced by idealism over fact. How it demands a new special logic.Projecting again. Very rude and completely untrue how do you expect me to react to this? YOU GOT ME! Im a big ol coward that doesnt want to have to talk to people or something? Lmao for someone that has such a hardon for debate you sure like assuming all kinds of shit about other people to make your point.gtThat is why you demand that no debate take place. Not because its unworthy. Because youd lose.Nope I love debate when it can be productive and I want there to be more open dialogue which it will never be with people who are holding positions that you cannot argue against. Prove to someone that fluoride isnt a government mind control experiment prove to someone that reptilians dont exist prove to someone  wasnt an inside job prove to someone that Obama wasnt born in Africa prove to someone god doesnt exist prove to someone god does exist. This shit is worthless to debate because you will never get anywhere with it and youll waste your time.Will you come out looking better than the other person? Sure but what did you gain?

I have the above topic in quotes because I want it understood that the liberal writings of  Florence France has been speaking to me lately and it has me questioning everything. Yet I remain firm on my fundamental beliefs and I believe this is why the world is the way it is today. Why our jargon is so stilted. The refusal to look beyond what we know to be true and constantly pointing fingers not realizing that when we point the one three more point back to our selves. When I take myself out of the picture and I see the numbers of those in my shoes I am made to ask If it matters so much right now where we came from and what we have been through to become the nation of singular voices we are today. Then why are we at an impasse about primordial matters Why does ACLU pull one way and ACLJ pull another yet use the same language. Why are my friends Those older than me screaming of past color blind injustices when a whole new era of outrage has developed and why are they so easily forgotten after lets say  years of deliberation.
