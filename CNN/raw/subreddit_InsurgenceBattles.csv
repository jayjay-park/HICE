4860962,0,t1_cu5gqcm,Delta Sunflora might work in higher tiers if Mega Reuniclus ever shows up and doesnt get banned to ubers straight away. Otherwise slow speed  mediocre SAtk  substandard defenses bad movepool  weaknesses to common attacking types like water rock and ground x! means Delta Sunflora will fit nicely in NUShould it get Giga Drain however thinks look much better at least in a Trick Room team. Switch in on a resisted attack while Trick Room is up grab a Nasty Plot boost then start wrecking with  Fire BlastFlamethrower Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb. Only Giratina Chandelure and Dragalge resist all three of those. Of course several special walls will still have a fairly easy time tanking,InsurgenceBattles,cu79emf,1,t5_34noh
