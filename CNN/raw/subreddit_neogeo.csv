2702736,0,t1_cnb9w3u,Yeah. They restocked Tuesday and sold out within minutes. Keep an eye on their Facebook page they post when the site gets updated with new stock.,neogeo,cnbahes,1,t5_2r6fm
2898509,0,t3_2tal3z,To be fair Samurai Shodown is misspelled legitimately on neogeo carts. ,neogeo,cnxkdn4,2,t5_2r6fm
4328197,0,t3_3ajdwv,Thats either a Bad Dudes or a Robocop cabinet.   is too much for a one slot conversion.,neogeo,csdimn1,2,t5_2r6fm
6590871,0,t3_45xu4y,I would strongly consider the in multicart since it can be had for about  on Aliexpresss. The copy of TSS on the multicart plays just as good as my legit copy of TSS and it is a fraction of the price.  TSS is just out of control price wise.,neogeo,d011t82,1,t5_2r6fm
7327575,0,t1_d2ax8xm,Please go more in depth about the encoderconverter what kind of things do I need? The adapter i have also can output SCART and when I switch it to output nothing shows up on the display. thank you for your reply,neogeo,d2b3fz5,1,t5_2r6fm
7403108,0,t1_d2jjm1c,Whats funny is that your post made me think yeah what the hells up with that.  So I looked them up trying to figure out where Playmore even came from.  And I was pretty surprised!,neogeo,d2jonro,3,t5_2r6fm

8104593,0,t3_4q52nj,If Im not mistaken Nobuyuki Kuroki worked on some character designs back in the day.,neogeo,d4r11v7,1,t5_2r6fm
9038673,0,t1_d7xyd49,It has a  monitor in it. You are correct I have a  slot pcb with a VGA converter. I think the games look great on it tinting the glass definitely made it easier on the eyes. I dont know if I notice a lot of the graphical things that people might have issue with Samurai Showdown looks really good on it. The wife and I play puzzle bobble the most and Ive always been a big metal slug fan. ,neogeo,d7yazit,1,t5_2r6fm

10394646,0,t3_5ota5h,I think Id have preferred to stick with a black topped stick but those buttons look sweet.,neogeo,dcmasoc,1,t5_2r6fm
10527690,0,t3_5pk7g2,One of my favorite Neo Geo games it was like the logical evolution of Ikari Warriors and Commando I have yet to play the sequel but the first game is the next best run and gunner to the Metal Slug series on the Neo Geo. I agree with you I really do wish it received a CD port along with Metal slug  and Garou Mark of the Wolves Kizuna Encounter.,neogeo,dd1ffdg,2,t5_2r6fm
