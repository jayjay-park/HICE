1168398,0,t1_ci125mz,Well I used this word when I refer to the centralized administration. When I deal with the individuals I use Bahai but actually I did not even think about the correct use of the word so maybe I was wrong.Thanks for this advice though.gt none of the new converts really got any supportI never met IRL any Bahai or exBahai nor any one that knows it exists but this phenomenon appears obviously from the outside. Many peoples witness deal with people left alone once a  person assembly was attained. Thats pretty sad for those persons.,exbahai,ci12cjx,2,t5_2sae9

2492424,0,t1_cmjvzrr,No someone who is attempting to claim to be an atheist and Bahai is not a Bahai.  A Bahai is someone who believed in the Divine Message and covenant of Bahaullah.  You reject the nature of Revelation and the Cvenant so no you are not a Bahai.The UHJ has condemned the people who deny the Divinity of Bahaullah and reduce Him to only being a good person or moral figure.  And the UHJ is the continuance of the Covenant of Bahaullah.gt bear witness O my God that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee.  I testify at this moment to my powerlessness and to Thy might to my poverty and to Thy wealth. There is none other God but Thee the Help in Peril the SelfSubsisting.gt In the Name of Thy Lord the Creator the Sovereign the AllSufficing the Most Exalted He Whose help is implored by all men.  The BbYes we can pray to God but never know His full nature.  That is just the nature of existence.  We have the ability to understand God as ordained by Him but we can never fully understand Him completely because of the limitations of the mind.We know God through the Manifestation.  They are the Messengers of God and the means to a limited understanding.  We know about God what they teach us.  gt   I know not that which profiteth me or harmeth me Thou art verily the AllKnowing the AllWise,exbahai,cmjwbrq,1,t5_2sae9

3087063,0,t3_2vicql,Hey maybe it wasnt the saliva maybe it was the father believing so hard that it would fix him that he got better himself? We know thanks to science how powerful the mind is over the body.,exbahai,cohz0ls,1,t5_2sae9
3120193,0,t1_coldpux,Except believing in invisible beings made of smokeless flame is an inherently illogical and ridiculous belief based on emotion with no clear or discernible scientific evidence.  Also it should be noted that Muhammad was simply carrying on a superstition from jahiliya.If you dont have reason then how do you know invisible Muslim genies exist at all?  What do you base this belief on?  How do you know its true?  Why believe something at all if you dont have evidence and only have feelings? What is your proof that there are invisible genies made of smokless flame?  Why not believe in faries?  Or unicorns?  Or the lochness monster?  Whats the difference between that and Muslim genies?  I believe that I have an invisible monster in my garage whose name is Bill and he likes pie.  Bill is above reason and understanding.  Bill is Bill.Do this belief strike you as absurd?  Why is it wrong since Bill is above understanding?   What makes Bill different from jinn?And were not talking about phenomena.  Were talking abut invisible Muslim genies.  Hardly rational or logical.  ,exbahai,coleo4h,0,t5_2sae9
3199442,0,t3_2wpk8l,I was a Bahai officially for about one year but found no deep truths beyond general humanism I next went back to agnosticism never expecting to become a Christian.Fast forward I got myself into some personal trouble and found myself praying for a solution my prayer was answered.  Soon after a friend approached me with a challenge to take the Bible seriously he claimed that it was without error a tall order for me to believe at the time.After beginning my Biblical journey I came to the conclusion that Christianity is the only possible explanation for why the world exists and why human beings were created.Every other religiousscientific explanation came up short in comparison.  Christianity provided me with a metanarrative that covered the entire span of time and humanity.The secret to Christianity is that it is like riding a bicycle one pedal for scripture and one pedal for prayer. This formula will introduce you to personal relationship that will change your life forever.,exbahai,cotme8t,1,t5_2sae9
4464413,0,t1_csrpw1j,Again you are defending Bahai Faith.  Bahais do nothing but lie.  They are trained to lie to promote the cult.  Yes Im paranoid...Im the problem.  Lets forget the argument and just attack the person making it. Typical.....  Your tricks are obvious buddy.  Perhaps if you got out of the Bahai cult circle more often youd see it too. You want to prove you are not Bahai?  Email them and ask them to  void your contract cancel your Bahai enrolment card.  Paste the reply here.

9741516,0,t3_5ejmn6,I agree with what you say regarding the right to criticize and so forth.On the other hand people who join the Bahai Faith or remain members do so voluntarily.  As such they voluntarily belong to an organization that delineates certain stipulations for membership including refraining from criticism of the Administrative Orders decisions.,exbahai,dadurl0,3,t5_2sae9
