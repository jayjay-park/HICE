9341059,0,t1_d7s0dp1,gt in Excuse my tardiness to the topic but I jumped down the rabbit hole on this case just recently and had a questionobservation about the text message sent to BL about the cop at truck.  I cant remember how advanced textingmessaging was then but does anyone know if BL actually received the text?  Like how nowadays it has Seen or Read pm etc. Apologies if asked and answered elsewhere and I missed it.   ,brandonlawson,d901p0b,1,t5_3g37x
