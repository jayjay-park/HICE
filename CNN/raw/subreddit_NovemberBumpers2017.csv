I then left the test on the counter while I went to get ready and when I came back to brush my teeth I saw two lines and FREAKED OUT! I was totally not expecting it. Literally as I was peeing on the stick I was saying to myself  oh Im out of tampons should go get some.I then texted my SO a picture of the test captioned OMG what did we do? I thought maybe the test was faulty since it might have been left longer than  minutes so during my lunch hour I went and spent a small fortune on those digital tests that tell you if youre pregnant or not in clear letters and did the test in my boyfriends offices bathroom.

She definitely repeats little sister more than little brother though hah!My morning sickness has been waaaay worse compared with my last pregnancy. Im so tired and I can hardly eat anything before pm. Im taking half a unisom and extra b and they seem to be helping a little bit. Hopefully it will get better as my hormones level out. My husband has been a champ he works from home and Im a mostly SAHM and hes been doing a lot more childcare while I exhaustedly nap.I also live in the Seattle area and Im excited to use my hmos midwives again. They do a thing where youre seen by midwives and delivered by midwives but in the hospital so there are OBs there and a NICU just in case anything goes wrong. I had really high blood pressure at the end of my last pregnancy and probably wouldnt have qualified for a birth center birth but I was able to have my daughter with no meds they broke my waters for me though.,NovemberBumpers2017,dfa6xpd,2,t5_3jb6y
