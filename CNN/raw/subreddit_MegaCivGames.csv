4882816,0,t3_3hrttl,. Ive taken the liberty to put down Yes in the Done? column on the spreadsheet for any civ that I can remember has a mod or is a vanilla civ. Unless the mod is horrible and causes the game to crash immediately this should disqualify the civ from being made immediately.. Makes sense. No Somerset. Should disqualify immediately except in rare cases.. If the civilization is important enough or occupies a part of the map with not a lot of other civs around it probably doesnt have to have a recognizable leader. Case in point the Nazca who in the mod their leader is literally the name of their capital. . Could probably just have slightly different uniques as uiontom keeps saying. Very flexible as you said.. No cities. No civ. And lets keep the Venicelike civs to a minimum. And by that I mean try to find some cities that at least partially relate to the civ instead of leaving it as a citystate.. Very flexible as you said.. Civ should be disqualified if you cant put it on a map.So it seems like the important ones are    and . The other ones are nice but not necessary and if they dont have that criteria should simply be left as low priority.,MegaCivGames,cua0mdn,4,t5_39im1
4900216,0,t3_3hwgdj,No because its just coast being used to simulate naval trade and warfare along rivers. River bonuses only apply to tiles actually designated as rivers by the game.,MegaCivGames,cuc7lq9,2,t5_39im1
