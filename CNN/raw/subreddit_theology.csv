173778,0,t3_1w25z5,Im actually researching a paper on women sexuality in religion.This whole idea stemmed out of the virgin birth and heres where the misconceptions arose. Mary was viewed as pure and sex was seen as dirty so God couldnt come from sex. That said the term virgin at the time actually doubled as meaning a young woman suggesting that Mary had actually had sex but was just a young woman when she conceived.Furthermore it was either John or Mathew who was obsessed with linking this to prophecy to prove that Christ was the messiah and since sex was dirty they arguably could have altered the meaning of the word to mean conceived without sex.Furthermore and you may not be with me on this the reason this view on sex was introduced in religion was to put focus on other things in life when this was all people thought about. If youre already doing well in all facets of life its impractical to ignore your sexuality unless you become asexual,theology,cey85m3,-1,t5_2qhza

3306807,0,t3_2y0udt,You will find as many opinions on this topic as you find theologians. That said in order to get an answer you might want to define what you mean when you say valid. As to the underlying premise the Old Testament is made up of all kinds of different literature Myth Fable Holyhistory Poetry Prophecy Apocalyptic Wisdom Literature Laments Parody Midrash etc... In this respect it is a diverse body much like the New Testament in which you will find Gospels Midrash Epistles Apocalypse Prophecy Sermons etc... Among Christian interpretations of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah the first division comes between those who will argue that the author of the story is retelling something that actually happened those who believe that the author is retellingreinterpreting an existing story and those who believe it was made up out of whole cloth by the author.Regardless one must ask What did the people of Sodom and Gomorrah do that brought about the judgement of God? Whether or not the story is factual this is still an important question if we wish to understand what the story is about.Some will argue that the cities were judged for a lack of hospitality citing Scriptures like Matthew . Others argue that it was a lack of social justice that brought about the judgement they will cite Jeremiah  Amos  and Ezekiel . Others argue that they were judged on account of sexual immorality here to be interpreted as either rape homosexuality or possibly a combination of the two citing Jude .I hope that helps...,theology,cp57aom,2,t5_2qhza

Make sure that you are not coming to the question with a general idea or concept within which they must find the true question. Know what youre asking and ask it directly.From my understanding first semester Southern Baptist seminary theology is done here from a means of Barth said this Calvin this Aquinas this. within the classroom and what do you think of this? I believe this in personal conversation. Theology seems to be done as a learning of perspectives somewhat a historical matter though many professors here are systematic theologians than formulating new ideas. Generally we go from one view to another given other theologians views on things in some classes adding our own view. I hope this answers your question.,theology,cqgmacr,2,t5_2qhza
3908690,0,t1_cr1r17b,Sorry trying to keep up with lots of threads here.Your theology sounds a lot like the selfstyled Church of Christ.  Which is not actually a good thing.  I was just trying to find out because it would help me understand a lot of your beliefs.Anyway back to the subject at hand.I would just repeat what most of the others even TETH have said.The way we think it works is that youre born spiritually dead and unable to choose God.  This is proven in Ephesians  and also somewhere in Psalm   we are by nature children of wrath.  Were born as slaves to sin because of the fall.  We are both guilty of sin and inclined to sin.  Spend an hour watching any toddler and youll know this is true they dont have to be taught how to sin.  I have  kids trust me on this one!Because were dead God has to first spiritually make us alive before we can hear the gospel and repent.  Just like Lazarus didnt choose to raise himself from the dead just because Jesus said to.  Gods got to take our heart of stone and give us a heart of flesh.Calvinists believe that your heart has been changed permanently and that as a natural result youll respond to the gospel in faith and repentance.  Just like Lazarus came out of the grave because living people dont belong in graves.  Just like a newborn baby breathes and cries and all that  its just what newborn babies do.Arminians the good ones anyway teach that God temporarily gives us enough grace to respond to the gospel.  This is called prevenient grace.  But if you dont respond God will remove that grace and youre back as a slave to sin.Pelagians deny that youre a slave to sin and need any help from God to repent and believe.  Thats a very serious heresy and I dont use that word lightly.Back to Calvinism... So youve been born again you heard the gospel and  now being spiritually alive  you repented and believed because thats what a new heart does.At this point all your sins are forgiven forever.  Jesus already died for them.But youre right that we are required to persevere in the faith.  We believe in the doctrine of Perseverance of the Saints  which teaches that the same Holy Spirit which regenerated us will now both see to our sanctification and will protect us from falling away.  Deut  says The eternal God is your dwelling place and underneath are the everlasting arms.God knows we are weak and frail.  He made us out of dust!  So thats why for instance Jesus told us the parable of the Good Shepherd who goes and tracks down His lost sheep.  He wont leave us to our own devices.  Hell keep His elect from falling away.This is how we make sense of  John .  They went out of us to show that they were never of us.  That doesnt make sense if you can actually be saved and then be lost  John would be talking nonsense!  They were in the church appeared to be saved but werent really.Also John  And this is the will of him who sent me that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day.  Jesus is going to do Gods will He wont lose any of us despite our best efforts.As far as baptism  we do believe that Christians should be baptized except there may be some really unusual circumstances where it doesnt happen e.g. a deathbed conversion.  However one is saved when one repents and believes the gospel. ,theology,cr1tqbn,1,t5_2qhza
3964019,0,t1_cr813al,I believe creation is infinite and I believe most individuals steeped in Western thought believe in a finite reality.The point though is that most philosophical and theological perspectives in the Western tradition rest on an assumption about the nature of reality specifically that reality is bounded to some degree. These assumptions though they may not seem so at first define and limit reality and thus the creator being. For example while the Christian stance is that God is Omniscient Omnipotent Omnibenevolent and Omnipresent all of which this proposed infinite being would be when confronted with the idea that the structure and function of the creator could be completely unbounded generating realities conceivable and inconceivable to the human mind Christians must rest their counterargument on an unfounded and limiting definition of the structure and function of God. Such a counterargument would contradict the OmniX position. All theological perspectives within Christianity would then be questionable.I am confident that this argument can be raised against almost every popular theological and philosophical perspective in the Western tradition to show how they all rest on the assumption of a finite and privileged reality.,theology,cr84qtb,1,t5_2qhza

5260831,0,t3_3lyqis,I have some thoughts on this but havent quite been able to flesh them out yet and do not really have a strong theological background. So I just want to speak about something from my personal experience. Over the last year I have been undergoing a spiritual revival. During that time I have seen great growth in my prayer life and my love for God and desire for union with Him. I have started to sense Gods presence in all things including both my joys and my sufferings. Because of this my sufferings have been mystically transformed into an encounter with God instead of a painful event. Over this time I have struggled with multiple serious medical issues a bout of depression and a temporary setback in my career and yet have found nothing but the greatest joy and sense of Gods presence through these things. More Reformed minded Christians might refer to it as a sense of Gods sovereignty. Others might call it a union with or deeper awareness of God. But I think that at some point Gods grace transforms a Christian to be able to find Him in all things. ,theology,cvk4o7r,1,t5_2qhza
5341872,0,t1_cvu8xrm,Exactly. Therefore christianity and christian thought was being formed... by Paul who was the greatest missionary of the time. Also a Roman who probably couldnt imagine a great empire whose economy wasnt based on slavery. Heaven knows what he wouldve thought about the woman at the well or Mary Magdalene and the women hanging around all the time.Whatever he had learned or thought about the things he learned and experienced informed the religious philosophy that he went about spreading. I just dont think we can separate Pauls personal ideas from his truly inspired thoughts. And I doubt he expected to be taken as speaking AS God.,theology,cvuhebp,0,t5_2qhza
5387811,0,t1_cw06b7g,Yes Im not surprised to hear you disagree with the notion of theology itself considering your statements.  Im glad we both care about truth. Once again you have issued quite a few opinions  it intrigues me that you if I understand you correctly are saying that  I shouldnt be selfish and then that  you dont care about me and are instead focused on securing your own role.  Sounds contradictory or maybe Im misunderstanding you?  Yes I understand you dont feel the need to invoke a creator to understand the laws of gravity  I dont either!  Glad we agree on that as well.  Again it sounds like we have different understandings of evidence.  The word evidence according to google is primarily defined as the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid.  Therefore everything that exists can count as evidence when evaluating a proposition including the proposition of the existence of God though you and I may choose to arrive at different conclusions about that evidence.  Your assumption that believing in God is irrational is demonstrably false.  I have looked at a lot of worldviews including Atheism and a lot of different religions I have gathered the available facts experiences and phenomena as they appear to me and I have chosen to go with what I believe to be the best and most logical currently available position.  Sounds rational to me!  You may disagree with my evaluation or conclusions but its definitely rational just so were using the same definition based on or in accordance with reason or logic.  To answer your question no I wouldnt necessarily prefer a scientific reproducible answer  I prefer truth at any cost which to me includes factoring in all available phenomena the senses the intellect the heart and what I believe to be the spirit.  If you choose to limit yourself to one spectrum of evidence and keep the presupposition that excludes the supernatural it seems to me that you are the one who is not open to factoring in all available data.To answer another question of yours it would take quite a bit to convince me that its not Gods presence that Ive felt and that has brought me peace.  Perhaps a scientific study explaining what people are feeling when they believe theyre feeling Gods presence and a description of what it is instead and descriptions of how the miracles Ive witnessed and experienced were frauds.  What would it take to convince you youre wrong?  Have you ever tried to ask God if He exists and been truly open to an answer of yes?  You are exercising quite a bit of faith yourself in believing what your senses tell you is true.    But of course we can do nothing more than act on what we perceive.  I will say a prayer that your perception is effective maybe it would be worth your time to consider becoming Agnostic rather than Atheist?  The universe is a big place and it takes a lot of faith to definitively declare you know something doesnt exist. Cheers  I still care about you.  Glad we both do and Im glad to believe God does too.  ,theology,cw0cqhy,3,t5_2qhza

6037065,0,t1_cyaoy4o,But think how do you explain away the commandments to not tattoo ourselves to people? The Christian fundamental taboos of men having long hair? The prohibition on eating shellfish? None of that is wrong per se. It was all only wrong in context because Gods people are to be set apart and noticeably so. At the time doing those things would have caused Christians to look or act like pagans. Tattoos long hair shellfish.... None of those things are associated with sin anymore. Thats why Christians may tattoo or have alt hairstyles. You dont look at a guy with long hair and think hes probably gay anymore. You dont look at a tattooed guy and think hes probably an idolworshipper anymore. The impression we give people does matter so when you dress like something incompatible with Christianity when someone who doesnt know you could get a wrong impression of you thats wrong. Thats why theres nothing wrong with wearing a skirt as a man per se but the impression it gives is one of transgenderism which is wholly unchristian and thus wrong in todays context. Wearing a hijab attending a homosexual marriage ceremony these things give off inaccurate impressions. Though we may not be Muslims and though we may not actually support homosexuality just our friends at the altar it is wrong unless everyone who might see you understands fully that you are doing it as a Christian with the correct perception. That is not the case here. ,theology,cyaz0l3,1,t5_2qhza

That and I worry with patriotism comes a lack of compassion for people in places other than America or a lack of being able to connect as a human being...these people being relegated to the role of the nebulous other. Does being a patriotic christian imply that we feel that God has favored our country over other places in the world?Dont get me wrong I love me some Merica and I am proud of my country but I also know that my patriotism is partly a result of my being born here and reaping the benefits of living here. If I lived in Moldova I think I would be pretty jazzed about Moldova and I would probably feel that God has favored us by our being born there. Im still confused. the love thy neighbor verse isnt restricted to national borders though. By taking a broad view which I will gladly admit that I am not a theologian so I am not really aware of the context of the verse neighbor could be another way of saying Love thy fellow man.

For a historical reference theres a book on ancient military magic that envisions using the Pythagorean theorem to calculate wall height along the same continuum as using pentagrams and spells to heal wounds.Everything else people have suggested are contours of more organized religions as they come into contact with each other globally.

If his statement is true the supervisor has wisely displayed an awareness of his limitations. If it is not trueif he can grant the request but simply chooses not tohe has been deceptive.Now how did Jesus respond when two of his apostles desired positions of prominence?
