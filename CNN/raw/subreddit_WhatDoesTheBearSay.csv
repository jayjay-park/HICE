312632,0,t1_cfd5zqg,gtThere is much debate over what the most dangerous animal in the world is.gtSome people believe it is a wolf or a shark.  They hold an irrational fear of the sharp fangs and ravenous appetites of these beasts.  Others argue for various snakes or spiders believing their venoms make them deadly beyond compare.  Some would even give the title to the tiny mosquito or the filthy rat harbingers of disease.gtOf course many would say that man himself is the deadliest.  His intellect his inventiveness his range of emotions all providing for danger unfound in nature.gtAll these people are idiots.  They have never witnessed the fury of a  pound Grizzly Bear mauling the face of some weakmuscled meat sac who thinks hes more dangerous than a fucking bear.gtAs a member of the Grizzly Gang you know better.gtIn fact youre not just a member youre the Grizzly Gang Godfather MafiaAligned.  Your fellow Grizzly Gang members are uHelpItIsSoCold and uBigMacIsNotABurger.gtEach night you may submit a target to be nightkilled.  You do not choose one of your gang members to perform the hit however  You can send your pet grizzly bear to do the deed instead.  This means that the death will be completely untraceable back to you.  Trackers Watchers and similar roles will not see you or your fellow mafia members visiting the targeted playergtYou win when all threats to the mafia have been eliminated.gtYou may talk to your fellow mafia members as long as you are alive.  If you die you may still observe the remaining mafias conversations but you may not talk yourself.And later on I received this messagegtYouve heard a new rumor that theres a private investigator in the town.  As the godfather of your mafia you have a new duty in addition to submitting the nightkillgtEach day you may submit the name of another player to me.  That night that name will be given to the private investigator who may or may not choose to take on the case.  If they do take on your case you will be informed of that players role in the morning.,WhatDoesTheBearSay,cfd68tn,2,t5_308qz
377258,0,t1_cfjv7st,gtSolo as in theres no other mafia or solo as in were working seperate from the other mafia members? I find it hard to believe they dont exst.Solo as in were a separate entity. Im sure there are separate hostile factions and because were labelled as grizzly gang and not just mafia I would assume some of them are also various types of mafia.gtLets go Brega. Ill use my Watcher powers on Eris.Sounds like a plan.,WhatDoesTheBearSay,cfjv9kn,2,t5_308qz
394507,0,t3_1yls7s,crazytwiYeah we probably should out tortilla. It would probably be better if I did it since Im already accepted as a mason. You should stay hidden in case the plan ever backfires. Alternatively we could tell the PI that we will submit the name of another one of our members to him in case I happen to die and that way you can be town confirmed when need be that way.pheicryI was half expecting Fluffle to be back by now. I still miss him.,WhatDoesTheBearSay,cflnnbw,2,t5_308qz
