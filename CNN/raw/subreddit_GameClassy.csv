The problem is that VFTs cause d auto hits with a  modifier to wound AND D pins which is counted against your auto leadership test which if you fail your unit is wiped. So unless you completely bungle the roll youre killing a unit per turn. Now filing the range is good but it is still too powerful for the point cost. Meanwhile simple machine guns is overcosted and no one takes them. ,GameClassy,co8y4pq,2,t5_32ggn
