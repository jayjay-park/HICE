5907296,0,t3_3updbm,Its actually not that hard to transfer into commerce. It is more difficult to transfer into arts. It may sound counterintuitive but I was hoping to transfer to arts from science putting commerce down as a back up option even though I expected it to be harder to get into commerce than arts only to find out I only made it into commerce and missed the cut off for arts. The same thing happened to a friend transferring out of law from another Uni. I think my WAM at the time was around ish. I had done previous art subjects with all Hs and it didnt matter  I think they only look at those subjects when they need to differentiate between students with very similar WAMs. See it was explained to me by a unimelb admissions staff member that a lot of students enrol in commerce straight out of high school and quickly realise they dont enjoy it its not for them etc. and then they transfer out or simply drop out. Arts on the other hand has a lot of people applying from external universities and a lot of people deciding to transfer into it after finding themselves dissatisfied with their first choice. So even though the atar needed to be admitted into arts is lower than that needed to enter commerce commerce is less highly sought after by nonyear  applicants and thus the weighted average mark required to get into commerce is higher than that for arts. Tldr Commerce has a high drop out rate and this may work in your favour. What I am trying to say is this dont be disheartened definitely still apply to transfer!! You are an international student right? There is also a chance things might be a bit different for you compared to local students. The commerce faculty loves international students because its so profitable to have students paying international fees for a degree that has relatively low course costs. Usually you dont need marks as high as locals to gain admission into melbournes degrees.Like you I ended up being pleasantly surprised by commerce at melbourne Uni. I particularly enjoyed economics and principles of marketing. Yes there are some dud lecturers but I met far more phenomenal lecturerstutors than poor ones. Some werent keen on recording their lectures but this is easily solved by recording the lecture yourself with your phone. This might help you if you were struggling for qm.Retaking QM wont be allowed you cant repeat a subject youve already passed if you have completed it in the last ten years. But if you transfer that subjects credit points over I dont believe it will contribute to your wam for your commerce degree? I may be wrong on this but its something to look into. The wam required does fluctuate each year so if you dont get in first shot and do have to transfer from a different Uni you can keep trying to reapply to melbourne! Personally I wouldnt want to study commerce anywhere else.Good luck and I hope you get in ,unimelb,cxtz9tm,1,t5_2smf4
6332945,0,t3_42476j,Unless you need the GPA for figuring out your score for postgrad at some other Uni you wont need it. WAM is easier to understand and more straightforward and now covers all postgrad at unimelb if not most other unis. ,unimelb,cz9hisy,1,t5_2smf4

7180530,0,t1_d1ucl8k,Yeah I think doing it at RMIT would mean you know your way around campus more friends lower ATAR requirement other stuff around those lines but honestly wouldnt make that big a difference. The physics department at unimelb is quite good I would say but I think consider other things student life clubs and committees ease of getting to class scholarships ect. Lots to consider!,unimelb,d1ud28t,1,t5_2smf4

10755494,0,t3_5tsoke,Youll have a course information day next week IIRC? I started my MCEng two years ago so that may have changed. Go along and introduce yourself to as many people as you can. Just dont be offended if people dont really want to meet new people some students did their undergrad here and already have strong freind groups. But therell be plenty who are just as new as you.Also on that same day walk around the clubs and societies area and see if any clubs seem interesting to you. Theres something for everyone and you can often sign up for just a few dollars.,unimelb,ddpcjsd,2,t5_2smf4
10838142,0,t3_5uxzug,Usually its only for first year undergrad and some masters level subjects that have staggered releases. Check your timetable via my.unimelbmy.unimelb.edu.au and it will tell you on each entry if there are further places left to be opened.Otherwise really timetable slots only get opened later than that if the class spot couldnt be registered during class registration i.e. A one off prac late in semester,unimelb,ddxvlq2,1,t5_2smf4
10849377,0,t3_5uedpm,Depends a lot on your course and subjects you take within that course. Broadly speaking science subjects have a higher proportion of students getting higher H marks  because often those marks are near impossible to get in an essay based subject. Hs arent easy in any course though but are achievable everywhere if you really want to put in the hours. If you have the motivation to get into a difficult post grad medicine or law for example youll need to try and maintain a H average. It definitely depends on what you want to do and what course youre in though as well as the subjects in that course,unimelb,ddz1bt1,2,t5_2smf4
