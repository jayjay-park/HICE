5327525,0,t1_cvsfh3d,This game is already a clear pay to win game. All what I said does is allow people that dont have much to spend access key buffs like slayer warrior aid and reduce status etc. It encourages people who are put off by the massive sum of money needed to have decent gear. It makes people put money on which are dettered from the gambling aspect. With all these groups spending money aswell as the people who are willing to spend money on the game in its current means they would make more money. Its also good for balancing the game and allowing people to have good gear for not much money. And it promotes more players as the game is cheaper. All of which encourage spending and people to be more willing to spend money. And makes the game more competitive and popular which encourages more people to play and spend. I also think they should look at aesthetics for extra money such as different colours for gear and being able to set up clans for a fee etc. But of course with the game at its current state its too risky and they have a safe and reliable option of the current happy cards. ,Happy_Wars,cvsnil1,0,t5_3a3im
5328637,0,t3_3nydb1,as mentioned does not effect the rate at which smash effect connects however since your bounce is reduced smash power down I noticed you can escape the juggle with this though.For certain maps it can be good cause you dont get launched by windtraps constantly. The buff everyone wants probably would be called smash effect rate down.. ,Happy_Wars,cvssm9s,0,t5_3a3im

5449881,0,t3_3pnv7b,It was a stormy October night in Japan when a dev was finishing rendering a D model. He was given the night shift and had to work all alone in the office building. Then as he closed out of his software a mysterious popup flashed on the screen. It read  Network Error. Please check server  in room .  The dev left his cubicle and made his way down stairs to the room. Lightning would flash through the windows briefly giving light to the eerie darkened hallway.The dev found the room. A sign above it said    Server Room  The dev turned the knob slowly opening the door unsure what to expect as it creaked the further it went. The room was pitch black and the dev was unable to peer through the darkness. Using his left hand he felt alongside the wall near the door turning on a nearby switch.The lights flickered on and the dev dropped his clipboard in shock at what he saw as he glanced around the server room.There were no servers....spookyu.Based on true events,Happy_Wars,cw89wgo,2,t5_3a3im
