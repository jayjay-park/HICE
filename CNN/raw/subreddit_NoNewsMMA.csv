5946029,0,t3_3wqwej,I dont think it qualifies as the best but Mauricio Rua hadhas an awesome guard. He only pulled one sub from it against Kevin Randleman but he had a ton of sweeps in his fights as a result of turning his hips and diving under hard for a leg. Figure he deserved an honorable mention at least,NoNewsMMA,cxz1yyf,2,t5_380tk
