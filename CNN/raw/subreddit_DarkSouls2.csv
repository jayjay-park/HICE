12123,0,t3_1u9hw9,The Master Key idea would be hilarious. I think that since theyve mocapped actual people that will be a big change. All of the weapons will somewhat handle differently than they did in Dark Souls so that will take a bit of readjustment. From what Ive seen in the network test the menus have been completely changed too. One thing I liked about the change from Demons Souls to Dark Souls is that while things were slightly different they felt somewhat familiar. I hope that the ambiguous familiarity trend continues here too. ,DarkSouls2,ceftc97,25,t5_2vqni

102558,0,t1_cepyfaf,That sword in the second shot is definitely similar or the same as the Lord Greatsword that Gwyn carried. Heres a theory Gwyns firstborn was a master of war a user of miracles and had a love of all things martial. He was also banished and stripped of his godhood for an unknown reason. The King of Drangleic was surrounded by retinue of knights known as dragon riders and if these knights truly did ride dragons or drakes it would follow that the King could as well. So here we go. What if Gwyns firstborn in order to further his prowess in battle began using Dragonsdrakes as mounts? It would have infuriated Gwyn that his son was in league with his sworn enemies the enemies of the gods and he surely would have driven him from Anor Londo because of it. So what if the firstborn left AL and formed Drangleic teaching the humans in the land to ride dragons while there?Gah so many possibilities... ,DarkSouls2,ceq3vmt,2,t5_2vqni

146174,0,t3_1vr4j5,The way I see it is that high equip load characters have a dump stat that doesnt cripple them with diminished returns past .I imagine that there will be a perfect balance in every toon combining agility and equip burden and thusly poise.  You will hit heavy diminishing returns on your offensive stats and then stop.  You will get the armor that best compliments your weapon speed heavy for slow slight for fast  get the appropriate vitality to keep optimal movement speed for the armorweapon combo and stop and you will then get the agility needed to raise your shield up in between the swings of a weapon that can poise break you in one shot in said armor.  The rest of the stat spread for the community pvp brackets would go into probably either hybridizing for damage or staying a solo stat dps while splashing into resistance.Needless to say casters to cast quickly will probably use light armor with a lot of attunement whereas a hybrid buff build would only get enough of intfai for a buff and attunement for  spell.  In the same amount of levels that both of those options can do that I would be surprised if someone couldnt make a strength tank with heavy armor that gets the optimal range vitality and resistance.If the community decides on a designated pvp level that restricts those clear choices From is trying to have us make then they are doing the game a disservice.,DarkSouls2,cev2wdb,3,t5_2vqni

175965,0,t1_ceycw9j,People who are good at Dark Souls have never complained about being invaded by or invading heavily geared players. It always came down to skill despite what the OP is saying.The issue revolves mostly around people who are starting out only know how to block and R spam and occasionally parry and those people will not be able to kill an invaded who not only knows what they are doing but also has gear that allows them to deal twice the damage and receive very little from R spam attacks.A skilled player on the other hand could be in a loincloth with a Bandit Knife and totally wrk a SL Giantdad. A player who started out and picked Knight just doesnt stand a chance.So why bother with the newbies? Why not just let them get wrkd at SL  through  by twinks? Well if they tend to get killed by what they deem to be unfair and it is in a way though ultimately the fault lies on them as you say they will hate the game from the getgo and just stop playing which is extremely unfortunate for higher level invaders Blue Sentinels all the folk who just want to enjoy some PvP and now have less players to invade.Nothing stops anyone from getting dat ember at SL  heck getting all the embers and then proceeding to go invade some starters but nothing stops the invaders from taking a moment to take fellow players into consideration. New players can no longer escape PvP and purposely giving yourself a statistical edge in what was already an unfair battle will just be worse for the game community.TLDR Its not just about the new players its about the new players quitting and it hurts PvPers.,DarkSouls2,ceyh62w,5,t5_2vqni
185428,0,t3_1w84r9,I agree that the cap must be raised but I hope that the cap isnt significantly raised. If we raised the cap to where all the new stats are accounted for in a build plus what stats the actual build needs to function then we are basically limiting the diverseness of PVP. In my opinion the cap needs to be set where the Player must be forced to pick carefully. For example If I was doing a Heavy armorweapon build then I shouldnt be able to put as much as I want in agility or at least without sacrificing endurance and resistance to put into agility.Same if I was doing a Light armor character. Movement should be the primary defense not having the Resistance stat to the level cap unless I sacrifice some movement for the added Resistance. This also weakens hybrids such as DexMage which is a good thing in my opinion because you shouldnt have the benefits of both classes with very little downside Like it was possible in Dark Souls. You are sacrificing some power for the versatility of using both classes. ,DarkSouls2,cezk3je,17,t5_2vqni

Maybe they want the world to return to its original state where dragons ruled and they feel that dark taking over the world is one step closer.Fire created the disparity. If the dark won out completely then there would be no fire by which to associate the dark rendering everything neutral again. Perhaps that is why we need the abyss the disparity requires both and the dragons want neither. Rewatching the intro sequence to Dark Souls again I realized everything came from the dark even the lords. They just happened to be the ones who found the Lord Souls in the flame.

They may learn that it is a useless tactic against Sentinels but its a habit from the previous games.White phantoms and sunbros will be attacked by monsters if they follow the invader into them.

Very similar to Monster Hunter which they also love. So I dont think culture has anything to do with it. I think the Dark Souls  and  scores are appropriate. If you arent into the whole masochism thing it can be brutal and not very fun. Doesnt deserve a perfect rating for a more general gamer. But when godawful games like FF get perfect scores Ive played the whole thing btw and  you just realize the scores dont really matter and its all subjective.

548369,0,t1_cg2lhaj,Poise has in Dark Souls  at least nothing to do with shields.  When you absorb an attack with your shield the amount of stamina drained is based on the Stability value of the shield.Poise is your resistance to being staggered when you take an unblocked hit which interrupts any actions you were in the middle of and leaves you open to further attacks.  With higher poise you can take stronger or more successive attacks without staggering.  With low or no poise even minor attacks will cause you to stagger if you fail to block or dodge them.It works kind of like a hidden stamina bar that depletes when you get hit and then regenerates if you havent been hit in a few seconds.  With  poise you can take one big greatsword hit or multiple smaller shortsword hits without staggering but once your poise reaches zero you will be stunned.The amount of poise granted by leveling END is quite low so it really wont make too much of a difference in that regard either way.  Most poise is granted from equipping heavier armor and from rings that increase poise.,DarkSouls2,cg2ltmx,2,t5_2vqni

Way of Blues intent is to give players a way to FEEL safer without having to completely disconnect from the internet.  It feels like its intent is to keep those who wouldnt participate in PvP from doing so by giving a more positive experience while still in the learning phase.On a separate note it confuses me why you seem to be taking the fact that there is a covenant designed for those who value survival over competition so personally.  Frankly the new systems seem much more convincing and realistic with their motives and interactions.  I never agreed with how easy it was to do bad things to strangers in the previous Souls games.  In Dark Souls  it takes more work to be bad and you have a chance of your plans being made even more difficult by invading someone protected by the Blue Sentinels.With the increased popularity youre gonna have way more players that just want to be left alone while they progress through the game.  Im fully aware experienced players of previous Souls games typically have the opinion being invaded is a core part of the experience but that very factor was a big part of keeping the game from having bigger appeal.You know how I played Dark Souls after the first day or two?  Offline only just like ENB because I just didnt want to be messed with.  Thanks to the increased difficulty of invasions during your First Round I havent been invaded a single time while still enjoying the normal connectivity benefits.

Its not a point A to B matter as you can choose to skip B go directly to C and then later come back to finish B.

591375,0,t1_cg7hkib,Infusing weapons with the same element as their innate damage is a great idea.Though I havent seen any proof yet I suspect the game uses a similar damage system to Dark Souls  in which case damage is reduced by a flat amount based on the enemies defense. This type of damage system favours larger individual hits. That is a single attack with  damage will do more damage after the enemies defenses than   damage attacks.So further increasing the fire damage should work well. If that was not enough the buff effect you mentioned works amazingly since that  bonus becomes much more effective. And if that was not enough then know that if you infuse a weapon with innate elemental damage with the same element it has already the physical damage of the weapon only drops by  rather than  which is how much it drops by if you infuse it with a different element!,DarkSouls2,cg7hrga,2,t5_2vqni

593410,0,t3_20x5oj,Love this!One thing that has been bothering me throughout DkS however is the presence of the giants. IMHO throwing away the idea that the giants in DkS and DkS are completely unrelated A. isnt doing FROM the justice it deserves and B. is even more unlikely seeing as that the company went through the trouble of adding in bits and pieces of the lord vessel in reference to the first game. If FROM didnt want to reference the original DkS giants they couldve just as easily named the giants in DkSTitans or something along those lines. Personally I believe that the giants in DkS and DkS are in fact the same beings. This however does not disprove the running theory that Drangelic was built where Lordran used to stand  the evidence supporting that is just too strong. What we do know though is that the majority of the Giants Gwyns ilk left Lordran to cross the sea when the first fire began to fade  leaving only a select few to keep up the illusion of a living kingdom cough cough Gyndolin cough cough. It is thus possibly that given the fact that Vendrick crossed the sea the sea at the queens AKA Manus request the king of Drangelic stole from the giants DkS thus causing these colossal beings to return to LordranDrangrelic and wage war against the then current occupiers. The question at hand then is how the DkS Giants ended up looking like the DkS giants. I have a couple theories for this however the most prominent in my mind directly involves Vendrick himself. If the king was indeed a chosen undead that would mean that  like all his predecessors  he has the ability to absorb souls. When Vendrick left Drangelic to attack the giants he went there to steal their souls thus causing them to quite literally hollow I mean just look at the big gaping hole in their faces leaving them with the appearance they are found with in the beginning of DkS. Why would the queen urge Kendrick to do this? Going off the fact that the queenManus the forgotten pygmy was never able to fully exact revenge against the giant kind since they fled when the fire began to dwindle using Kendrick to hollow the giants thus punishing them in the most ultimate of fashions was the best way to exact herhis revenge.Thoughts?,DarkSouls2,cg7q3kz,2,t5_2vqni

So she had King Vendrick go get the lord vessel and planned to let the kingdom fall into ruin as it did she wanted to claim Vendrick and the other great lord souls for herself. At the time she didnt have the power to take on the giants so she used Vendrick. Vendrick figured out from the madness spreading throughout his kingdom what she was doing and in turn sealed himself and the four great lord souls away so she couldnt get to them. So she attacks you at the end of the game because you have claimed all of the souls that she needs. If she can kill you at the throne of want perhaps it is possible for her to bring back the abyss.,DarkSouls2,cg8hgl6,1,t5_2vqni

603968,0,t3_211wof,gtGrab Repair Intellect is pretty easy to get. Unless you are going Noncaster I dont see the reason not to get this spell. Your equipment will never break again.Not really worth it carry around a secondary weapon for when your primary breaks if it is fragile. Bonfires are frequent enough that you shouldnt have to dump  points into intelligence just to repair or waste an attunement slot on the spell. You meet a vendor who sells unlimited repair powder eventually and you can wear a ring that massively slows degradation.gtUse Your SoulsA standard build will have  VitEnd and a core stat of maybe  on StrDex or IntFaith depending on your preference. The other stats can come a bit later. In addition getting your weaponcasting utility to  is the biggest bang for your buck. If you still have leftover souls buy lifegems. I have a stock of  right now and thats low.Dont level infinitely eventually you will have no one to play with. I made that mistake in DS leveling my first character to SL  huge mistake. Most people are stopping at SL if vg is anything to go by.gtLearn To CheeseSpecifically Poison Arrows. Even veterans will tell you to buy up those suckers like they are going out of style. Gavlan will sell them to you and if you talk to him in all of the places you see him he will begin to sell you an unlimited supply.Another cheese tactic SlowMo. Rest at a bonfire. Take out the nearest camp of enemies. Return to bonfire. Rinse and repeat until they stop spawning  spawns. After youve done this you can explore at leisure and use an Effigy to summon phantoms for the area boss with all of your Estus and spells up.Bow amp Arrow in general is broken the AI is on a short leash and wont chase you very far from their starting position. Some mobs are too large to go through doors etc. Some patience with Bow amp Arrow is all you need to get past challenging foes. It feels cheap as hell though.My own tips Use White Soapstone to refill your estus flasksrepair your equipment the small white soapstone has a time limit and is more reliable in this regard as anyone can summon it where the big soapstone is only good for people who havent cleared the area boss. And if you die as a phantom you dont lose anything other than the consumables you used during your adventure to another world. Check vendors periodically they update their stock under certain conditions. A lot of them tied to your progress in the game while others tied to how much money youve spent on them.

604165,0,t1_cg8tagv,I certainly wont get mad. That would be ridiculous.While your points may lead to the idea that the EmHerald and Nashandra want the same thing theres nothing that link the two of them together.  To assume shes manipulating the player is a pretty bold assertionone that cant be made without substantial backing.Ive only beaten the game once and would need to play through again good news thats in progress! with your ideas in mind to fully formulate my own opinion of them.  That said there seem to be a few wrenches to be thrown into the three points you make Its heavily hinted that shes the last fire keeper.  We dont know what the powers of a fire keeper are but we do know that in the world of DS the player can warp between lit bonfires and that the Emerald Herald is in possession of an item that teleports its user to a bonfire.  We dont know why the EmHerald can move across the continent in the way that she does but Id assume that it hinges greatly upon that feather she gives you and her firekeeper powers.  Further since youre lighting all the bonfires it makes sense that she too could teleport amongst them.  and  these would hold more weight if the game gave us a choice towards the ending but it doesnt.  You become the new king of Drangelic.  Theres little talk of linking a flame or becoming a dark lord the endings of DS.  In fact in my first play thru I heard nothing of either.  I did of course hear the EmHeralds pleas for me to break the cycle insinuating the dark lord ending or its equivalent and ultimately thats what we see in the ending cutscene. I do think that the EmHerald doesnt want the cycle to repeat itself but I dont think theres nay evidence discovered yet that connects her to Nash.

I wont indict you.,DarkSouls2,cg8y3qn,1,t5_2vqni
604677,0,t3_20slnh,Read a bit of these comments and have to say I disagree with people saying pvp takes less skill now. It actually requires footises and spacing now. I come from fighting games and play them at a good level and I can  say the pvp aspect has improved ten fold. Every weapon has the same advantage of the next because now they can combo also the combo is bigger the closer you are. So if u get hit point blank ure gona be hit by a big combo which is totally your fault as someone hitting u point blank means your spacing isnt too good. I feel this pvp is at a much higher level then ds  pvp as ds pvp was turned mainly into backstab fishing and anti backstab fishing. As for the people saying its easier to backstab on ds I say lies! I dont think backstabbing is easier on dark souls II and havent been backstabbed at all! Also fishers are free now lol,DarkSouls2,cg906zw,0,t5_2vqni

605675,0,t3_212kl4,There are three ways to do it. Spam nukes. Flame Swath Soul Spear Soul Greatsword Flame Swath Soul Greatsword Flame Swath Great Resonant Soul Old Sun... This only works on the worst of players and occasionally a decent one. Anyone else will punish hard Put on AffinityCrystal Soulmass run at enemy explode a bunch of spells as your buddies fire punishing them for dodging the first shot. This only works on intermediate players and occasionally a vet. This is bad because it doesnt work against turtles you need a bunch of time to reload as well which you probably wont get. Subterfuge and trickery. Use big spells that blanket the battlefield like Poison Mist and Soul Vortex. While your opponent is freaking out about these spells he doesnt understand sneak in a Soul Spear. Run up to your opponent and bait an attack chain then Soul Greatsword to the butt. Its really effective and comes down to this when two amazing players duel the one who makes less mistakes wins. You gotta be good enough to hang with the best even if you wanna use magic.And a top secret fourth spam poison mist as they summon then run at them and WotG until they send hate mail. Not honorable at all and not fun either but you technically get a decent shot at beating everyone because you played unfair.

609766,0,t3_214ldy,Ive probably farmed roughly k total souls here. I try not to overdue it  because I dont want my soul memory to get too high. This is my second character so Ive been bulldozing through the game and have generally been underleveled. So when I need to catch up I come here. My first playthrough I hated the iron keep but now I find the area incredibly easy to shred through. On my first playthrough I farmed bosses or whole areas but between weak enemies in other places or the host dying on the boss I find that this area is almost a guaranteed k as nobody seems to die until the iron king Started farming  levels earlier and am still getting summoned less then a minute each time. The Iron Keep seems to be a hot spot for all levelssoul memory. ,DarkSouls2,cg9kzue,1,t5_2vqni

610172,0,t3_214pdp,This fight sucks. Since you already beat the boss of the area normal summon signs wont show. Signs from the small soapstone will though theyre few and far between.The first thing you need to do is grab the giant souls. Those  trees that look like giants the dukes dear freja arena and one more from killing the ancient dragon. Without these souls Vendricks defense is bullshittingly high. Something like x without any of those souls.Once youve got the souls get to the King. Now this next part is important so listen up.HIS. SWINGS. FUCKING. HURT.So unequip your armor. Twohandpowerstance your weapons. Learn to dodge.Stay stuck to his ass leaning by his left leg. Hell be baited into one of his attacks which if you dont suck you can dodge or avoid then punish him with  swings. Back off to his asscrack of safety wash rinse repeat.Something that might help if you cant be bothered to get the souls if you get invaded in the crypt the boss door from the previous boss will come up.

616523,0,t1_cgacf8e,I totally agree the Bastille was worth a second look. The Flexile sentry was definitely a soldier of king Vendrick from The presence of common Drangleic Infantry at No Mans Wharf illustrates just how integrated the Varangian have become with the normal forces of the kingdom. The Infantrymen have even adapted tot he favorite combat techniques of the Varangian such as using fire and oil to eradicate any who would oppose The King. Drangleic and king are used so its Vendrick the Flexile carries the undead between the two so the fort was definitely used by Vendrick but I definitely like the idea that the Lost Sinner may have been its first prisoner and the prison itself grew up about her over hundreads of years. ,DarkSouls2,cgacluw,4,t5_2vqni

I think of the hollowing like the last plague to be visited on a dying age before wiping the slate clean and starting over. It says as much in Demons Souls and if they did continue to exist then you would never start a kingdom near. You would move to another continent as far away as you could get. Anor Londo built a special jail near the end of the kingdom to house the undead but who is to say this is what it was for at the beginning? A kingdom could not flourish in the face of hollows at their strongest they were completely wiped out why would they be able to start from scratch and get the strong if the threat was still there?,DarkSouls2,cgaigos,1,t5_2vqni

620365,0,t3_218y3b,Well I for one am using the armor I find graphically most pleasing on my mainchar. Im playing a sorcerer at low weight without any shields and since I got the clear bluestone ring   gives you enough casting speed to make the lionmages armor pretty much obsolete it doesnt really matter what armor I wear as long as its light enough. Weak enemies will do pretty low damage on NG once your armor is upgraded far enough and big enemies like bosses will pretty much oneshot me anyways. So right now Im running Hexers hood which is pretty much core on any magicuser due to the additional spellcasts it gives you the rogue gloves and greaves since I love the armoredbattlemagelook they provide and any casterarmor be it black chaos holy hollowmage etc. In the end you can  of course  minmax to get the highest possible defenseweight ratio but the beauty of Dark Souls is that you can pretty much pick the equipment you like the most be it look skillset or special bonus and still be proficient in both PvE and PvP.,DarkSouls2,cgasbcp,1,t5_2vqni

But to attempt to pin every single RPG into either one category or the other is stupid. There is a gradient between the two not a firm divide. A game can have a little of both. There are JRPGs with realtime combat. There are WRPGs with Japanese stylings. There are linear WRPGs and questbased JRPGs. The Souls series is right there in the middle. The artstyle is heavily Japaneseinfluencedthough not really anime influencedand the story has a very Japanese undercurrent. The gameplay is somewhat nonlinear but the story is still fixed and the delivery a lot more in common with characterdriven JRPGs such as Persona and Valkyrie Profile than it does Skyrim. The combat is realtime but it is still very technical and demanding. ,DarkSouls2,cgbk3x1,1,t5_2vqni
627404,0,t1_cgbk9l2,gtThe damage is insanely high for relatively low risk I cant agree with this either. Ive been summonedgetting invaded by casters all the time since yesterday like not able to complete an area level of frequency here and Ive not had trouble with them. To me it appears that the risk is fairly high because the second I get to them.... theyre dead. Their spells are incredibly simple to dodge the ones that arent dodgeable havent found one yet actually you could just tank it with a magic res. shield. Even if I dont feel like closing the gap I just use dragonrider bow. Yes it works.... and it works well I might add. To say there is fairly low risk in comparison doesnt really follow in line with a general overall understanding of PvP at the moment. Which means I have to ask what build youre running because as someone else mentioned these builds will obliterate glass melee almost every time unless youre dodging. With everyone testing out their new stats and weapons Ive been seeing plenty of glass melee people so if youre running that setup Id be inclined to believe that is where youre finding your difficulties here. gt Its supposed to be a tradeoff of damage for survivability Well thats exactly what Ive seen so far. Ive not met a caster that didnt die swiftly to even an unupgraded Drangleic sword.gtright now magic gets the best of both worlds while melee really doesnt.If by this you mean dmg output and survivability then I must admit that Im confused and need more explanation. As of the moment my character can dish out decent enough damage and retain enough health to carry the fight on after a few bouts against casters I havent had much issue with them at all. At this point Id also like to note that pyromancies are still an option provided you know how to use the opponents cast times and positioning to your advantage.gtIm not saying magic should be nerfed so much as Im saying magic mitigation should be massively buffed. If you want to fight naked for weight thats your prerogative but if not doing so is a liability because the armor doesnt actually help you survive then something is wrong.Id be fine with heavy buffs to defense so long as the tracking was slightly increased. As it stands now its too easy for me to roll away from anything they use and I have like...  adaptability or something? I think we can both agree that the level of adaptability I have here is something to be noted because if its that low then other characters shouldnt have a problem with it provided the connection isnt terrible.... which I guess should also be noted since I have yet to have a bad connection experience with this game.gtBut yeah Im pretty much done with pvp in this game until the latency issues are less fucking ridiculous. I lost  straight fights to people casting spells in the literal opposite direction and havent played much since. Im sorry but at least with melee toons even if youre not quite where I think you are I can still Dodge and hit you. Looks like I picked a good time to type up that previous sentence. Haha. Jokes aside Im actually curious as to why this is. My online experience so far has been relatively lag free and so has everyone elses that I play with. Is it possible someone else in your house is using bandwidth or that your isp isnt providing enough?gtWhen someone casts a bullshit mass of Bullshit the fact that half the time the graphics dont display right and that half the spells look damn near identical doesnt help much eitherThats not something Ive encountered yet so I dont have much advice to give here. Everything Ive met so far has displayed properly.gtand it kills you while you are backstabbing them then its very easy to say to hell with this. Which is exactly what I did.If that did indeed occur which Ill assume it did since you at least took the time to respond to me then that is understandable. Hopefully your latency issues get fixed eventually. ,DarkSouls2,cgbl50n,2,t5_2vqni

639871,0,t1_cgc5qjr,Like Ive mentioned elsewhere bows and xbows are weak as hell compared to spells. Each arrow does only a sliver of damage. I have fought plenty of people who shoot bows and use avelyn and even three direct avelyn hits cant compare to one single hit spell that takes out my entire lifebar. A  heavy crossbow with magic bolts does  per hit max and takes  seconds to recharge. All you people who claim bows do jack must be fighting weak ass players. Ditto throwing knives. Range attacks should always be weaker than physical in your face attacks. Its just completely lopsided. I could always use a soul vessel to respec and have OP magic spells AND physical attacks but I shouldnt need to fight magic with magic. Kind of ridiculous how people dont get such a simple concept. This means everyone has to be jack of all trades and build diversity really is meaningless if the balance is so screwed. Mages have the advantage of range and a diverse spell set.

Later on I pushed to strdex Im leaning towards that being a mistake. I also started upping Adapt to about  after Old Iron King Im not convinced about that either.Other than that I basically just dumped into VigEnd and occasionally Vit when I had equipment I couldnt use below .TLDR I mainly focused on getting weapons  handable then alternated between VigEnd also Vit where needed and then pumped StrDex when I felt I needed to improve weapon versatility.,DarkSouls2,cgdain5,7,t5_2vqni

It totally got rid of any fear I had from losing to a boss at the end of a stage since I could respawn at the bonfire without having lost any souls or my humanity.Id be surprised if they dont make it so the rings actually break permanently like they have in the past games making it a rare item that gives you pause before using it or seriously up the soul cost for repairing. k souls isnt shit once you get midgame and beyond.,DarkSouls2,cgdc11l,1,t5_2vqni

No gimmicks or cheese tactics just avoid their attacks and hit when they recover. No need to suddenly turn into another game and have the player solve some stupid puzzle.

655012,0,t3_21n8hb,Vendrick and Aldia tried to fight against the curse by peering into the nature of the soul. What they did is creating a powerful Golem  the Ancient Dragon. Vendrick then probably stored his soul in the Shrine of Amana so Nashandra couldnt take it or something along these lines. Theres a lot of clues that the Ancient Dragon is a golem they created. Shalquoirs dialogue the fact that it drops a giant soul and the description of the actual Ancient Dragon Soul which says it was created by those who peered at the essence of the soul which is what were told Vendrick did.The curse is NOT the undead curse. The curse the NPCs talk about is the one that affects the land the reason kingdoms rise and fall on the same spot etc.The curse of the undead is probably caused by the Flames fading.The Emerald Herald was born of dragons contrived by men and she seems to be allied to the Ancient Dragon so shes probably the result of Vendrick and Aldias experiments on dragons as well. The mutated undead in Sinners Rise are called enhanced undead and theyre the result of Aldias experiments  seems like they were trying to mix dragons and humans in some way. I guess the Emerald Herald was the end result of these experiments.At least this is my take on this lore.,DarkSouls2,cgeq3qg,42,t5_2vqni

661517,0,t1_cgfgj0u,gt Lordran sends legions of giants to take back their souls and reclaim their power.No they did not. There is no proof that the giants are the same. The Giants of Lordran wore brilliant and beautiful armor crafted by an exquisite blacksmith. Whereas the giants we see invading Drangleic are clothed in rags shamanistic and only use at most clubs for weapons. They are not the same Giants.It is much more probable that Drangleic is Lordran. The Lost Bastille which is reachable through a flight of Eagles? Where the Undead are corralled? Much like the Undead Asylum no? Or maybe the fact that Straid comments that when he was petrified Drangleic was known by another name? Eons may have passed but the land and its cycles repeat. Vendrick may have stolen something from the Giants but what it is we will never know. Was it the Lordvessel? Doubtful.What exactly Vendrick did at the behest of Nashandra is the missing lore piece here.As for Manus he was not benevolent in the slightest. The reason we have the Curse of Undeath is because the Dark Soul is in direct conflict with the Lord Souls will. The Age of Fire is an abomination to the Dark Souls will. The Dark Soul has its own will and bent Manus to it. When Manus failed to usher in the Age of Dark the smallest fleeting shard of the Dark Soul carried on its will. Nashandra knew that the only way to end the Age of Fire was to bring back the fragments of the Dark Soul into its original form and thus sought to do so. But the Chosen Undead foils her plan and thus the Age of Fire will most likely continue.,DarkSouls2,cgfgq0r,1,t5_2vqni

670581,0,t3_21shdd,This is a really great post. I think its more than just a sequel about sequels though I believe that thematically the game is about how desire wanting things is really just going by appearances... and that the ultimate result of endless want is to go hollow and forget who we are and where we came from.Notice faith is a bit of a mockery in Drangleic as you alluded to. King Vendrick is often described as not really believing in miracles and including priests in his ceremonies and crew just for appearances. He doesnt really trust this stuff he just wants it there for looks rather than its essential character.Speaking of just for appearances... masks. Masks are a very common symbol in DkS there are tons of them... as if many of the characters dont know who they really are and are just going through the motions. In fact many of the characters are so concerned with appearances  with wanting things achieving things  that they forget who they are and where they came from.Mauglin the Armorer the Lost Sinner lost because she tried to relight the first flame... The manikins who had their real faces torn off and replaced by masks because they desired Mytha...  Vendrick himself who is faithless and peered into the nature of soul not out of curiosity but out of a desire for something specific he was going by appearances too. The game thematically seems to be a riff on the ultimate soullessness of desire with Manus and the Throne of Want presiding over the endless journey. ,DarkSouls2,cgght1a,6,t5_2vqni

671950,0,t3_21ua68,Im actually rather disappointed. Theyve tweaked the timing of animations to the point that it feels like a completely different game to me. DS had the best feeling melee combat of any game Ive ever played. Period. DS feels sluggish in comparison and I cant seem to get used to it. Ive got some  hours in DS and about  so far in DS. Im towards the end of the game but at this point most things are shotting me and I simply cannot seem to get used to the changes theyve made to character responsiveness.The story seems a little less epic and the world feels more sparse simply because its more spread out. Its not as interconnected as DS was. I loved the mindfuckery of the map in DS. All the shortcuts and connections. DS doesnt quite have that to the same degree.However by far the best changes in DS are in regards to magiccasting. It feels so much better to be a caster in DS. It no longer takes you  seconds to cast a bloody spell. You can get them off pretty quickly with enough attunement. As much as I want to like DS it just doesnt hit me like DS. Its lacking that charm and it feels almost like a hollow attempt to recreate it rather than a sequel that plays on the strengths of those charms. I know most people probably dont agree with me but except for the magic changes Im rather disappointed by DS. Im still going to get the PC version however and see if my feelings change. I hope they do. I want to like DS but.. it feels like they changed the very things I loved DS for.,DarkSouls2,cggneyg,3,t5_2vqni

679935,0,t3_21y2b3,The ring certainly does kind of negate the concern about health loss. I dont know whether I agree that its a bad thing or not but the point being made is true. I found it to be so during my own play through. Once I had that ring I just didnt worry about it and told myself to start playing as if  was my new  health and to level up accordingly so that the missing  was never a big deal. I guess I still found plenty of challenge in the game and wouldnt necessarily want the ring gone. If they got rid of it I suppose I would just use the same strategy start compensating for the potential  health loss by just leveling up accordingly so that  of my health bar was still comfortable. Plus later in the game you started to get such an abundance of rings that youd like to use that it did become a game of deciding whether to keep the ring of binding on or not. So you are kinda faced with whether or not you want to keep using a slot on it. ,DarkSouls2,cghk52w,2,t5_2vqni

693199,0,t3_223cxm,The idea that putting adds in a boss fight makes the boss fight more Challengingharder and therefor better. While it does make a fight harder or more challenging it doesnt make it better. what made some of the bossfights in DS good was the fact that you had to figure out what to do and most likely die a few times to do it even in the v fights.in two a good number of the fights are Quickly kill any of the little trash in the room then dodge around while you watch the boss slow walk at you because there is no way you killed all his minions so fast so he can walk at you slow.or they are just like The Dukes Dear or the Vanguard heres the boss and some trash just use a greatsword for the first part and then a few spells for the second.or they are like the Spookie spookie guys who i didnt even realize the mechanics for the fight for until my fifth playthrough. every time I just ran in and killed all three bigs then kited around the others and slowly killed them. No thought really needed.Honestly my major gripe is the adding trash to fights to make it harder thing. its why i stopped playing MMOs it just feels lazy im looking at you NGOh and random deadangles from bosses.

695284,0,t1_cgjatnj,I understand that. However doing PvP isnt meant to feel grindy.  Most PvP players will play way more then  duels.  They will play thousands.  Just like you play thousands of hours of PvE.  If all the PvP achievements were small like the dragon covenant most PvP players would quickly max out their chosen PvP covenant and essentially have no reward for all their playtime besides increased PvP skill.  I got Rank  in the Dragon covenant in a casual evening of PvP play. I was happy at the time but also disappointed.  I left that covenant shortly after and am much happier working on my Bluebro status.  I feel like when I do reach  wins I will feel very accomplished.  It would be nice to get that same sense of accomplishment from PvP as you do from becoming a onebro or something else wouldnt it?  I have seen a few streamers get their Sentinel covenant rewards and they were beyond stoked. Nothing is making you do the Blue Sentinel covenant. I imagine you werent a forest hunter in DaS.

Could be wrong. Not sure. Original point I was trying to make is that Nito creating them doesnt mean that they had to be contained in the same area. If their purpose is to watch over the dead that would be a global thing IMO. Or if Drangleic is truly the place all undead end up through their wandering it would make sense for the creations of Nito and the watchers of the dead to make their way there as well.

705772,0,t1_cgjy6xp,One problem i have with the Sunlight Altar theory is that its too similar. If you look at the models they arnt similar they are literally the exact same model Point for point with a simple retexture.How is it the entire world around it has changed  from its original design but the Sunlight Altar which was on top of a castle on a cliff a possibly quarter mile or more above the ground below is perfectly intact? In the exact same way? There are no remnants of the massive castle there was once there.Its too perfect and if this much time as passed how is it perfectly preserved? Not well preserved perfectly even after the entire castle under and around it have fallen. Im putting my money on it just being a model reuse because it is the exact same model. And for all we know there could be been Warriors of Sunlight spread across the entire world.I feel like its not a good piece of evidence because its just too perfect in every respect with no explanation. Ive always leaned towards Vinheim myself as just the way the world is laid out leads me to think its an entirely different continent from Lordran. Lordran seemed to be Landlocked with neighboring nations surrounding it where as Drangleic is literally on the Sea. Youll see no ocean from Lordran from what i can tell as it appears to be surrounded by land and lakes from all sidesThere are a lot of other good questions and lore items to be had in the game that raise questions but the General Location of Drangleic and the overly perfect Sunlight Altar both make me think otherwise.,DarkSouls2,cgkhztp,0,t5_2vqni

Shell never hit you with this if you just walk up towards her face and you have a lot of time to hit her. If you walk back to her side as she recovers its likely shell do it again.She usually jumps back when she staggers though which sucks because this is when she might use magic. If she does I run as far away as possible so I can hopefully dodge the magic before she catches up to me. Works about rds of the time.

There are already known problems and bugs with the way damage is dealt with how infused weapons do more damage than raw physical weapons. Just search that problem up on YouTube where people have done extensive testing to show this is actually a real issue.I bring that up only because you seem to be under the impression that since technically a strength weapon should do more than a dex weapon that this MUST be the case but in fact thats not true at all. All that matters is how it truly plays out in the game and I can tell you that my experiences Ive said are true.But for now I guess ill take your second option with just getting a washing pole and spamming it  ,DarkSouls2,cgkma1i,0,t5_2vqni

A big problem I find is that theres precious few venues where a person can consistently get v fights. Both covenant arenas require payment and cracked red eye orbs become exponentially harder to get as you run out of places to get souls.I dont really see the problem with buffing weapons either. My favoured build right now uses a Demons Great Hammer and if I dont Resonant Weapon that sucker it is not viable. Ill hit for only slightly more than a normal greatsword would and for a weapon with such telegraphed moves thats not something I can deal with.I guess my point is I dont understand your complaint. Youre annoyed that people are running around with what is most efficient apparently ganking not included I dont personally consider those actual fights because of the insanely skewed odds.Can you really blame people for using a hood that increases their casting speed or amount of casts if it only weighs about . units?,DarkSouls2,cglefx5,2,t5_2vqni

Generally you want to use it at melee range beginning the charge as an enemy tries to roll into you and slamming it into their face as they spring up to strike. Dangerous but done correctly it will staggeroneshot pretty much anyone.Additionally if your enemy is trying to fog gate out its one of the best spells to take them downsolid range and it will as said before kill them in one hit.Really I believe its good for PVP but not as a bread and butter nuke.

716507,0,t1_cglp20i,Im just going to say what youre describing has absolutely not been a problem for me. I absolutely agree that theres a problem with the sword particularly when you consider that for some builds they just need to hit you three times but with Havels shield it could be different with others the stability afforded means you can soak up a ton of hits while sliding around behind them for a backstab. It isnt perfect no but its a solution and its one Ive been enjoying a good amount of success with. It comes in part I think from the fact that people using MLGS arent used to extended melee battles they normally just step in swinging and win. Give them resistance and your experience in melee combat should win out in the end provided you play smart. ,DarkSouls2,cglpxu7,1,t5_2vqni

If you are over  sin you become labelled as a Sinner visible from your player screen The only way to remove sin is to die to a Blue Sentinel who will CONSTANTLY invade you if you are a sinner. Once you are below  sin the invasions will cease. Enjoy your deaths.

There may be a better set to wear and jump the gap opposite of the fog door then across to the stairwell. Use a Pharros lock stone up top to open up a pool of water which you should roll through to get wet. Then use an orange burr before going through the fog. Fighting him at this point is easy. Shield up when his attack animations start otherwise treat him like dragon ridercircle that mother. However when he jumps up and stabs his sword into the ground get back because hes going to explode. Even with your fire resist this can hurt.With this strategy and summoning in some phantoms to occasionally pull aggro you can bring Lucatiel in with you if soloing this fight is pretty easy.Hope it goes well for you!EDIT Im on mobile can someone see why my spoiler tag isnt working?

And that is very easily achieved in a minute or two by joining the ratbros and attacking a mastodon in the area you find Santiers. As a ratbro you cant hurt the mastodons so the weapon clips through them but still counts the hits.As for OP I would recommend you play a more typical playstyle until youve broken the Spear and have got it and the Avelyn upgraded and mundane then change your build over to fit.,DarkSouls2,cgomxta,1,t5_2vqni

742482,0,t3_22nrga,Theres definitely a bit of learned programming from DaS. I mean walking into anor Londo and immediately going up those crazy rooftops and giant rooms really set the environment and the exploration of it on center stage. THAT was dark souls kind if like fallout in a way where you are just hopelessly traversing decaying environments that told as much a story as the npcs did. I also was upset walking into Heides for the first time. I had the DaS inspired feeling of holy shit Im going to need to explore a burning tower with flaming libraries and lord knows what kind of monsters feeling and it was pretty bizarre not having to deal with one fire related obstacle and just fought large knights the whole time. Not to mention not figuring out who heide was or why the hell the tower was perennially aflamelorelust lol also I havent yet finished the game so hopefully that and more is explained This has probably been stated ad nauseum but DaS is far more combat driven and mechanics based rather than the environmental focus the first two games had. I remember taking issue with DaS for its bonfires til I realized it was one impossibly large world. Similarly now I am extremely satisfied with the relentless amount of pvp that goes down. Still a bit let down from how strangely compact areas are in  though its frustrating not being able to satisfy the same urge for explorationIt really is a different strokes type of situation. I really wish the two styles could have merged flawlessly but they are making strides in different directions. I love all Souls game but really am hoping the next game will achieve what this series is truly capable of  huge dreary fucking castles stories characters enemies annnnd greatswords,DarkSouls2,cgoobpq,40,t5_2vqni

They wanted to make the game feel grander in scope but they shouldve looked a little more at the player base for these games we watn exploration not just grandeur. I myself want to feel lost in the world and that does happen in a few places. Heides tower and Cathedral of Blue though you only see a minor portion because that is all the remains of a Kingdom maybe? before Drangleic and the idea of its scope is meant to drive home how no matter how grand something is in time all things crumble to dust.

I managed to kill most of the initial spiderlings in the first  seconds yay Pyromancy and then got right up under Frejas legs and was able to hit her headasses with impunity. I didnt even try to dodge the beam she only fired it once and I was on her flank so it wasnt anywhere near me. I was fortunately able to quickly kill any other spiderlings that came close bc its DS so the smaller the enemy the bigger the threat and just stayed right up against her side waiting for my opportunities. It did get hairy when she does her legstomps but I got lucky enough in dodging those. Smelter was mostly a matter of me having completely the wrong equipment i.e. bladed weapons for that fight.

770551,0,t1_cgru47s,What would you define as the meta?If youre just talking about SL the meta evolved around where Froms designed system stopped having everything balance out. In Dark Souls  that happens around halfway through NG if you were leveling regularly in this game I would have hit it around the same time if I didnt do a bit of grinding before I carried over. Their system doesnt take the SL meta into account at all its just natural that the meta would fall around the same place assuming they designed everything using the same principles as before assuming they balanced everything around the end of NG. If you mean tactics then at the very least they wanted to stop the game from becoming as Back Stab centric as Dark Souls  that much is obvious so they are to some extent paying attention to how people are playing the game and trying to steer them in what they believe to be the right direction.Also I dont see how that makes the word fix a bold choice. If they want everyone to continue to level up which I think they do given how they set up SM in the first place then naturally there would be an incentive for everyone playing to do so and not simply start a new character once they reached a certain range because certain ranges arent fun to fight within. Part of that incentive would be to encourage variety to make PvP in general more interesting and forcing one to sacrifice one stat for another having that show noticeable pros and cons for either choice something that the current system has at low levels and lacks at high ones. The fact that people want SM gone so they can all play with just s tells us that people dont think high soul levels are balanced properly and could be in need of a fix. One of the most obvious problem is the lack of a hard cap instead allowing everyone to level to  in every stat.Thats not to say it would be simple or easy. One of the biggest hurdles in accomplishing this is that part of the balance is tied to equipment which is balanced with lower soul levels in mind. You would either need to alter the equipments base stats to scale with high levels in mind once you cross to ng or create entire new sets of gear that possess both better stats and higher requirements that would be designed for use in a high level Environment.Honestly the more I think about it the more I think it would just be easier for everyone if they just went back to matching with SL there are too many pieces that fail to match up at higher levels to require much less than a total overhaul.,DarkSouls2,cgrv6ws,8,t5_2vqni

773143,0,t3_230ds5,Hiya. Im not sure there is any good way to farm up  awestones but I can share my experiences. Character  just completed a playthrough entirely in champions covenant. Ive hit up every NPC invasion with the exception of Navlaan and Ive gotten a pretty decent amount of stones from random monsters  farming. Ive also killed  human invaders. At the end of all of this Ive collected  awestones. Theoretically I could get  more by tapping Navlaan. Ive also acquired  bonfire ascetics  bought from darkdiver. So Im still a ways off.Character  Reached  bonfire ascetics halfway through my NG runthrough. Went to the first bonfire in Aldias Keep in the shack and farmed up all  awestones via respawning Aslatiel of Mirrah who invades you just past the keeps entrance in the hallway before the bone dragon. As a bonus there are  petrified dragon bone drops that get refreshed in this area. This is obviously pretty time consuming but to speed things up I developed a strategy. A  caestus and  strdex. Apply poison resin. Stand next to him as he spawns and when his greatsword shifts position to his shoulder swing until youre out of stamina. Backup regen stamina and repeat you should be able to stunlock him before he hits you. using this method killing him is fairly easy despite the insane damage he outputs as your bonfire intensity increases. After optimizing everything it took approximately .. minutes to grab the two dragon bones and kill him. I was able to farm all of the awestones in a little over  hours total time I did it in two  hour chunks. Hope this helps.,DarkSouls2,cgs5sv6,2,t5_2vqni

Id say that Ring of Thorns  max rank Blood and the Illusory rings no deathbonfire are the ONLY rings that are really rare. But still these rings shouldnt be indicators of cheating since a random cheater or otherwise can leave them for you in a summoninvasion legitimately.I think the easiest way a mule can be caught without a doubt is if the anticheat checks obtained boss souls or spells maybe versus the respective bonfire intensities since those cant be moved from character to character.

780439,0,t1_cgsuoqo,Ive played every zelda game since the original with the exception of the handheld ones and ive always felt that their fundamental gameplay comes from puzzle solving. Looking at the first one on the NES for example your immediate objective is to figure out how to access each dungeon. Once youre in a dungeon you must navigate a labyrinth of dead ends breakable walls illusory walls secret switches secret doors etc. while collecting tools necessary to beat the boss and move on. Its pretty puzzle based. Zelda  on the NES was more combat based but it has been received fairly poorly by zelda fans in comparison to the rest in the series.This game also has a few optional itemsbossesdungeons just like dark souls now that i think about it. ,DarkSouls2,cgszn3x,2,t5_2vqni

Its nice to occasionally bump into people with mic and talk about the game I know Ive come across new information by users with voice chat and I can also guide people through a level vocally if they want it. Anyway my method of voice chat depends on people having their mics on already and I like the chance of my next coop partner either wanting to talk on mic or not.

783258,0,t1_cgta51t,I suspect that it was a long time ago so much so that the mans name is forgotten. I think the Old Iron King was ruler of Alken at the time of his reign and probably when Venn and Alken were having their spat. The Prince of Alken could well be his son which would explain why Belfry Sol is built within the grounds of Iron Keep.Venn and its princess are more of a mystery. The Lost Bastille would have likely been a castle at the time and not a prison and probably where the ruler of Venn lived. As Venn and Alken hated each other the Prince and Princess would have been forbidden to meet.This suggests that it would have been a long long time ago.. Straid was petrified when the area of the Lost Bastille was a prison and the kingdom was called Olaphis  even this was before Vendrick rose to power.If you notice the whole Alken area  Huntsmens Copse Harvest Valley Earthen Peak and Old Iron Keep  were locked away and considered forbidden areas likely during Vendricks reign.

Either stop leveling and find yourself at an evergrowing disadvantage paired with more and more ridiculous havelmages or keep leveling and don the ridiculous armor yourself. Get your character to  or whatever then make it Arenaonly drastically cutting back your soul acccumulation if not eliminating it all together.  This is the only sustainable way to avoid the Soul Memory problem but the more souls you waste through hexes consumables arrowsbolts or equipment breakage the less sustainable it is.  It also gets boring after a while. Keep making new characters.  Get your character to  keep playing it as normal until you get sick of ALL HAVELMAGES ALL THE TIME then reroll and start the process over again.

804806,0,t1_cgvj4cq,Except that the breakpoints have been reduced to  on most stats meaning that one can have a perfectly efficient and serviceable amount of HP stamina and equip load at lower stat allotments. If we assume  vigor  endurance and  vitality on top of  points put into magic stats thats still only  levels with  to spare for general shenanigans if you want to keep to SL.  points is absolutely plenty with which to hit the minimum requirements for an excellent weapon then infuse it into a strong source of damage in its own right. Given the increased power and scaling of split damage weapons plus reduced elemental defenses across the board this allows casters to hit hard up close hit hard at a distance all the while hitting resilience breakpoints just fine. Theres no downside or weakness here  theres perhaps less extreme investment over the top of breakpoints but the fact that the breakpoints are so low and going over them so inefficient is another factor working against focused nonmagical builds. ,DarkSouls2,cgvrdew,2,t5_2vqni

807067,0,t3_23cxu8,Well I was playing a Melee build and using the Drangleic sword and I managed to farm out the area with relative ease actually. Yes the AOE did get me once in a while but if they do belly flop and you can avoid it by trying to shield it as fast as you can. It will drain your entire stamina but your stamina will recover quicker than they usually do. The trick that I used was to step towards the running mummies instead of backtracking like we usually do for every other enemy type. You should start your attack when they are  paces away from you this way they will go down midswing just when they are about to start their stupid bellyflop. Meet them head on and try to aggro them one at a time especially the ones next to Straids Bonfire The Bonfire with the petrified statue.

820645,0,t3_23j37g,i dont use shields anymore because i find that the stamina drain by soul level  that people are doing with their spells and weapons is more than if i just roll away. so when i invade ive got my catylyst in one hand and my weapon in the other. i think psychologically people wont be as cautious because youve had your catylyst in your hand the whole time. imagine your logic when someone losing a fight to you suddenly switches to a catylyst from a shield. what do you do? back off right? well they wont be doing it  if you have a catylyst in your hand from the beginning of the invasion.i know thats such a little detail but i find it to be really helpful. now that thats out of the way suck. pretend to run away. get hit a few times and run. when they get close gods wrath. simple. with the catylyst already in your slot and you not showing them that youre going to be doing something amazing by switching from a shield to your catylyst more often than not theyll just run into it since they probably suck anyways for having to roll as a squad.other than this all i can think of is know your environment. if youre in lost sinner just take the elevator up and down or send it back up to troll them. if youre in bell covenant. just run up the stairs. fall down the hole repeat. if they follow blast them in the face as they jump down. my favorite is gank squads in dragons shrine. ill just run around and take the shortcut ziplines. press x to jump on the zipline but dont move. just fucking sit there until you see them zipline across. let them know that you see them and havent zipped across yet until they zipline to you. get ready for hatemail.,DarkSouls2,cgxk5jt,1,t5_2vqni

He created this series in the first damn place to be a challenge to be hard to be uncompromising but to be fair in its challenge. When they ousted him from the development cycle and hes said he was said he wasnt involved in DkSs development they definitely forced him AND the other lead developers out thats why if you compare the credits they have a lot more than just Miyazaki gone. Its very much about it being easy or hard yet fair. Btw I dont think Amana was unfair. It was a place that made you take things slow or youd die but thats how the souls games are... its one of the few areas in the game that ACTUALLY was more in line with the previous souls games. You never rush an area your first time through or you will die to traps enemies tricks and everything. I do think the projectiles were a bit much but there were plenty of obstacles to hide behind while you take potshots with them. Even as a str build Ive had arrows and bows to take them out. You can also time dodge the projectiles too.People who complain still are coming off as new to the series and not getting what the point of it is or ya... its frustrating for people who have been fans of the series for awhile who want to keep it hard.,DarkSouls2,cgxsa2s,-1,t5_2vqni

As an NPC he does absolutely nothing of note but sell a few useful items move around the world nonsensically and acts as a garbage disposal for the player character to gain a few souls. Not only this he repeats a single line of dialog and people go absolutely crazy. Solaire was a memorable character because he actually had a place in the world being a character that you met and summoned in multiple key places during the course of the game. Solaire fit within the story of Dark Souls while Gavalan honestly feels like a filler NPC without a real purpose other than repeating a drinking animation and triggering fanscreams with his pointless dialog. gtyou definitely have to take your health seriously in DSII and choosing the right time to heal is as important as ever.Everything heals you in Dark Souls II. There are way too many things items that heal you.

Its possible that your poise meter wasnt full it takes  seconds to refill or that their numbers are just wrong but Ive seen other posts confirming similar numbers. Note that when you poise through an attack you will still be slowed down.Whether poise is broken is mostly semantics. If by broken you mean buggy nothing indicates thats the case. If you mean broken in the sense of greatly nerfed then sure. Its been nerfed effectively because weapons deal much more poise damage now and also it takes a long time for poise to regenerate.,DarkSouls2,cgy741l,3,t5_2vqni

Every other class starts at a higher level with an equivalent number of additional stat points e.g. Warrior starting at SL with  stat points.The only reason one class would be more suitable for a build than another would be if the build required stat points below that classs minimum stats but since Mundane builds have a minimum of  in every stat every class is equally good at them.,DarkSouls2,cgzceip,2,t5_2vqni

838153,0,t3_23pvh1,As we all say healing during a random invasion is whatever. But this video is an excellent example of why I dislike healingregenerative items being enabled in the arena.The opponent healing in the video wears full Havels armor. His effective HP is far higher than the invaders. Even if the invader could heal each ounce of Estus consumed is more effective for the Havel wearer. This works the same way with lifegems and mushrooms. It also drags fights out. It promotes tagyoureit dueling. It promotes sloppy play. Oh you done fucked yourself in the first five seconds of the arena match by charging in like a fool? Better reset with four taps of the X button. It also promote gimmicky play ala chameleon shielding with a Growers ring seeking a free backstab. Im all for innovation but if you botch your gimmick you dont deserve a mulligan just because Estus is virtually impossible to punish. Which brings me to my final point  whats easier to punish an Estus user with...a resonant Rulers Blade or a quality Espada Ropera? Healing promotes burst damage over methodical play which is especially true considering the new backstabbing mechanic makes landing a BS on an Estuser all but impossible. soapbox,DarkSouls2,cgzjua6,4,t5_2vqni

839560,0,t3_23pa19,Demons Souls  Intro. Introduces the setting story and main objective in a comprehensible way take that DaS I! while maintaining a strong atmosphere like the intro from DaS II.  Story amp Lore. Each area has a coherent convincing and enthralling lore and story of its own.  Atmosphere. Demons Souls has more atmosphere in its little finger than both Dark Souls have when added. which mostly means DaS II alone since I has next to zero atmosphere.  Level design. Relatively linear but every moment of every area had something interesting and unique about it.  Art and environments. Not a single place that feels bland or uninspired.  Creative and varied boss battles. Gimmicky perhaps but it helped to keep every boss fresh and unique unlike DaS I and II which had some repetitive encounters.  NPCs. All three have great NPCs but in DeS they all felt interesting and believable to me no exceptions.  Consistency. Ultimately there is no that lessthanstellar areabossenemystory in DeS every second feels significant.  Least polish and variety in combat. As is to be expected from the first game in a series. Still great anyway.  Poorly explained mechanics. How the hell am I supposed to understand how World Tendency works? Or how to upgrade weapons into different paths? Too much nonsense.  Interface can be hard to understand at times. I still dont fully understand the weaponsshields menus.  Grinding for ores. Pure Bladestone.Dark Souls  World design. Loved how areas interconnected had many shortcuts and could be seen from one another in a coherent way.  Ash Lake. Still the most visually and conceptually impressive area I almost cried the first time I went into it.  Intro. Confusing and not that interesting.  Worst areas. Too many areas are either bland or downright horrendous in design.  Atmosphere. It barely even exists for the most part.  Soundtrack. There are great songs here but too many generic orchestral fauxepic ones too.  Voice acting. Some NPCs just sound too silly or contrived. And the laughs are mostly terrible.  Consistency. At the same time it has some great areas and bosses it also has many uninteresting locations and crappy enemies like the entire Demon RuinsLost Izalith sequence.Dark Souls   Variety. The sheer quantity of everything in this game is astounding.  Difficulty. Not only is the game harder than the previous it also offers nifty options to make it even more challenging and rewarding.  NG. Its not just harder it has new things. Loved it.  Soundtrack. Close call between this and Demons but I slightly prefer this one.  Diverse and polished combat. Feels better and richer than in previous games and I love how every playstyle is viable.  PvP. Consequence of the previous point.  Villain. Despite being a weak final boss I really enjoyed Nashandra her reasons origin and concept.  Streamlined mechanics. Upgrading equipment and understanding covenants in particular is just so much more simple this time around.  Voice acting. All NPCs sound memorable and convincing throughout their different moods even when dialogue is silly.  Unique narrative choices. Unironically loved the idea of applying the effects of the curse to the player  confusion lack of purpose loss of reason and forgetfulness.  Torch. I love it.  World design. I understand and to some extent agree with the reasons but it still feels stupid at times.  Excessive checkpoints. Do we really need  bonfires in the Lost Bastille section all of them less than a minute away from each other?  Disappointingly small areas. Too many places that seem immense but are actually short and linear. Drangleic Castle Aldias Keep and Dragon Shrine being the most blatant examples.Favorite . Boss Flamelurker. He has it all amazing atmosphere phenomenal music cool design the perfect balance between difficulty and fun and I love how he gets harder and more aggressive as the battle rages on. . Level Tower of Latria. Cant choose just one this entire sequence is the pinnacle of the series for me. . NPC Maiden Astraea amp Garl Vinland. Love their moral ambiguity relationship and dialogue. . Song One Who Craves Souls. Hard to decide though. . Game Demons Souls.Least Favorite . Boss Bed of Chaos. Interesting idea horrible execution all around. . Level Crystal Caves. Its short linear lazy ugly has a pathetic boss and annoying gimmicks. . NPC Frampt. Always disliked his looks voice personality and overall silliness. . Song Gwynevere. . Game Dark Souls . Despite being the first I played it just doesnt interest me as much as the other two. Among my favorite games nonetheless. The weakest Souls is still a Souls after all.,DarkSouls2,cgzpldj,3,t5_2vqni

What skill. But our master never dies. And he changes form so he may seethe for all eternity.spoilerTark also describes his master as someone who went mad craving what others had that he did not have  in other words he could be referring to Seathes everlasting quest for proper dragon immortality lacking the scales of his fellow dragons.spoilerEdited for proper spoiler tags.,DarkSouls2,ch0r86d,3,t5_2vqni

When you click the game waits to see if you are double clicking normal attack  single click from the left or right mouse button strong attack is double click. Because of this there is a bit of a delay. So if you want to try to do the Shield break you need to try to time for that delay which is damned near impossible to do consistently.

862440,0,t3_23yg6q,Honestly People that are complaining about magic are really complaining about the lagphantom range. If its lag free unless I screw up I will never get hit with a spell. Its way too easy. Now lag can change things up. I win  of all my duelsinvasions against magic users so I dont want them to nerf it because they are questionably easier victories than other meleers. Also if they nerf the spells then they need to nerf stunlocking. If i get stunlocked by a defenders greatsword rulers sword or watchers greatsword then I have almost more than half my health gone. Its a mechanic thats in the game that I think is actually alright.Soul memory does need to change or people need to adapt. I think the nd is impossible because  of DS players are stubborn. Who knows they might make some big changes in the future. Right now Im having a good time pvping and when I lose it is because I did something wrong or my opponent just had a better idea for the fight.

890034,0,t3_24bfvj,Change it up by reading their movesets. Basically now instead of being able to depend on enemies having low poise poise is actually use against you.Now I feel that its easier to just wait for a tell that an enemy has overcommitted. For example in the Pursuer boss battle heres his basic movesetIf youre far away hell either do a forward stab the curse stab or hell do his dash in up swing. If youre close hell slash right. If that misses hell shield bash left. If that misses and youre STILL CLOSE hell either overhead swing or spin slash. All of these attacks are rollable but heres the gem you have to convince the AI to overcommit. This can be done AFTER the shieldbash. If you make him think hell get the overhead OR the spin slash and roll to dodge it hes open and punishable for at least  seconds. This is ample time to cast drink estus use a gem or wail on him for a few normals or a heavy or two.Thats how Ive gotten through most of the game as a caster with light melee but full melee builds should be roughly the same.,DarkSouls2,ch5g8ml,5,t5_2vqni

The amount of hits santier does combined with the stone ring makes it do crazy high poise damage capable of rather easily staggering even havels. SO now imagine against people not using havel its an instant stone lock as soon as you get so much as clipped by the santier spear. Combine this with its hitbox being far larger than than the actual weaponmostly makes it hit all around the user in a sphere unlike the katanas running attack which hits further than the blade and you get a fast stun locking aoe and rather powerfulon a mundane build mostly weapon.,DarkSouls2,ch5wlvo,1,t5_2vqni

904593,0,t1_ch70e25,Here is what I think about that. Havel along with many other warriors went to kill stop or free the tossed experiments in the grave of saints gutter and gulch? Possibly Havel ventured down the hole only to be captured and locked away. This explains why his armor is in a pot behind hundreds of poison statues. He was one of the only people that ventured down there in an attempt to put an end to the madness but he failed. His body is a treasure locked away behind a huge door and spitting poison statues.Over time havel would be declared a saint. He was already a bishop and a death would only make him more popular and legends would be formed. Havels armor was crafted from rock and he would never flee from battle. This would make any fight in the Grave of saints the gutter and the black gulch extremely difficult.The Grave of Saints is the name given to the land beneath the pit due to the amount of explorers warriors bishops so forth that had dropped down and never came back Havel would be one of them. It wouldnt originally be called the Grave of Saints until years maybe kingdoms later. But by that time it would have become overrun by rats and fallen warriors.As for the name Harvels resting place it is quite possible it is a bastardization of the name Havel. According to his armor The origin of the name Havel is not clear. Some say it was the warrior who wore the armor but others say that it was the name of a great kingdom ruined in a barbaric war. Nobody knows for sure what Havel even is. Harvels Resting place. Harvel meaning the lost soldiers of the Kingdom or Harvel the great warrior. Nobody really knows which is which because i is all legend and the times of old are long forgotten.Havel could have quite possibly made it to the rotten in an attempt to defeat him but he lost. He was put into a vase and locked away as punishment. Starved poisoned hollowed this is how the great Havel dies at the hand of Pharros the Vagabond and Aldia. His armor being made of stone is all that remains of the great warrior.  Unlike the pit where you find Havels armor isnt supposed to keep him in but keep others out.,DarkSouls2,ch73vuz,3,t5_2vqni

Though it definitely becomes more difficult in combat.Personally I think this is Froms way to making it harder to break a guard.

Hell even Rotten being Pharros was a new one to me.Heres a few questions that popped up in my head while reading this that you havent explained . To be clear the poison eye trap statues refer to the humanoid statues in the gutter I think in the doors of pharros and next to the majula hole? Not the poison masks in Drangleic Castle?. Are you saying Pharros would have found a third way into the Shrine?  The first two being the collection of all great souls and the nd being having a lot of random souls. Im thinking the magicallylocked door might not have been there if the Rotten didnt exist then I dont really see the Rotten just wandering around or climbing over the shrine or something. Basically Im saying that since the Rotten didnt exist then perhaps the other  Old Ones didnt exist or have the great souls either which would leave the Lordvessel defenseless were it really hidden there.. If the Lordvessel really was in the Shrine why bring it all the way to Majula before breaking it?,DarkSouls2,ch7v4d7,2,t5_2vqni

921427,0,t3_24luzu,I know you already got a few answers but Ill reiterate again just to clarify the purpose of soul memory. In dark souls it was very easy to optimize a path through the game aquire a weapon with low level requirements and use all the souls you had earned to do nothing but level up said item. You could be a really low level but have really good gear and invade other low level people with lesser gear than yourself. To combat this now every single soul you earn weather it be spent on a consumable item a weapon weapon upgrade or level counts towards your soul memory. As far as I know if you had  souls on your person die and then go to retrieve your souls your soul memory will not go up or down from the action.Ive made multiple characters by now and Im trying to optimize a path to get to MY favourite weapons and armour so that I can continue to assist people with bosses and the like without having to go to specific areas where people will likely have the same soul memory as me but it is fairly tedious. All in all though I think it is the better alternative to people getting their high end gear and invading low level players. Hope this helps! ,DarkSouls2,ch90t1j,1,t5_2vqni

923074,0,t1_ch94te1,First of all Id like to say i appreciate the actual response. Most people are just trying to troll which while amusing is not what I was looking for. Buying consoles isnt bad but forcing PC gamers to buy consoles is bad. There are so many people who play PC only and will only ever play PC. A series going console exclusive which was already multiplatform really sucks for PC gamers. It doesnt even benefit sony too too much they would probably make more money if they would release the game on both PC and PS. This post was really directed at people who dont want to own a console and I should have made that more clear. I dont know what youre talking about. I dont want the removal of PS. I know nothing is set in stone but the few facts we have and many members of the community point to this game being a PS exclusive like DeS.Well you just proved that my point is based in fact. My post is about resisting the temptation to buy a console for the next souls game so that sony might release a port. After saying my post sucks you prove my point buy sayingHell I probably will buy a PS just for Beast Souls.I should have made this more clear I was adressing people who do not want a console but were considering buying one for the new souls game. I was asking them not to buy the console as a form of protest addressing exclusives never being released PC. ,DarkSouls2,ch97j87,0,t5_2vqni

931844,0,t1_cha3mej,Yep. I like the idea of an immersive indication of damage dealt but its too difficultor at least time consuming and therefore expensive to implement. Even if they had the budget to accommodate for it it would largely be dictated by their publisher what that budget is allocated to. Also even if they pulled it off somehow the mainstream players would likely complain anyway. Its pretty simple in theory though. Just rig animations with physics and have enemies animations get progressively more sloppy slow and weak. Maybe even lop off limbs have visible wounding and bleeding have pieces of armorscales fall off etc. It would take too much work to expect to see this in any game any time soon but if done right it would be just too awesome for words.,DarkSouls2,cha7ei2,3,t5_2vqni

Its a woman who obviously had ties to pyromancy who attempted to relight the first flame.The witches also tried to do this by creating their own which created chaos and demons. Inside the bed of chaos is a giant chaos bug that was created from these flames. When you approach the Sinner the same exact bug except a fraction of the size is seen. When the great souls spread and started placing their influence on the land this poor woman attempted to do what the witches had done and recreate the flame but the result wasnt nearly as big or far reaching as the chaos flame hence her tiny little bug giving her inhuman strength and reflexes. The pyromancer phantoms are an added difficulty that also are there to reinforce what the sinner was a pyromancer. Who is it?

Not tanking levels but youre not naked either.   The floating jumps are a great way to put distance between you and whatever you want. You can cover ground and end up in areas that opponents have to actually work to get to. They also allow for mixups since you dont have to do a full on float every time. Great for PvP and PvE IMO.  You can cancel out floats if you are twohanding a bow by hitting attack. You drop straight down very quickly with an arrow at the ready as soon as you land. You can also perform drop attacks by hitting L from a jump if youre on a fairly moderate slope.  The poison the set poops out makes a lot of players skittish if you manage to get in close and you hold your own long enough without dying. It also poisons mimics without aggroing them.   The shield is fun as Hell to bash people with when infused with poison.  It makes me feel like a pretty princess.,DarkSouls2,chc8i5h,10,t5_2vqni

961240,0,t1_chdjojb,Because its an epic fantasy book about undead somewhat similar to the undead in dark souls. Randomly people from a certain region are afflicted with an undead illness. They get splotches all over their skin and their bodies stay alive but stop healing. They round them all up in the city of Elantris gods used to live there but then dieddisappeared and the people think the old gods of the city and the illness are related so they bring them here. and the cultural climate there is such that nobody wants to get injured EVER. The main character stubs his toe pretty bad at the start and it is a HUGE deal because every injury adds up and never heals. You can be stabbed through the gut and it wont kill you but you will feel that pain and it will likely drive you completely insane. The same happens naturally over time from small injuries that build up and wear on a persons mind. Later in the book undead who are given a task to do to keep their mind off the pain show improvement in their sanity and will to live.  ,DarkSouls2,chdjvqz,10,t5_2vqni

969458,0,t1_chegmok,I hardly ever use a shield its dull and makes most fights pretty boring. But from what I remember though you can only sufficiently block his attacks when you are high SL with high stability and perhaps even magic shield. If I recall correctly you can also only interrupt his chargeup if you have the means to stagger him. So this describes only a minority of builds that people play and SL that they reach through normal play. Granted its probably one of the most used and common ways for people to play and beat DS but Im judging this fight from the perspective of a variety of dodgefocused builds without sufficient means to stagger his chargeup or block his attacks. He attacks really fast and you need precision timing on your dodges to dodge these attacks. Only easy one to dodge is his jump but he rarely uses that most fights so you cant really rely on that. ,DarkSouls2,chehjlu,0,t5_2vqni

If youre going for a meele build get the minimum requirements for your weapon a Katana or a Greatsword are both a good place to start infuse it to either fire or dark and then put a buff on them. Seeing how the stat system works this is the only way to make a meele build viable at lower levels.If youre a caster I cant really help out with character building as I yet have to make a caster.Always use a parry shield! It doesnt matter if you can actually parry but if you have the option to then your oponent wont just mindlessly spam their weapon into your block.Learn how the various combos of different weapons work most importantly your own.

Nothing quite so sinister as Manus the originator of the Abyss. Darklurker is actually one of the more mysterious parts of DSs lore like how it can use every kind of magic except lightning thats gotta be meaningful somehow. I think the main reason The Abyss seems different now is because . It is manufactured somehow the portals to it are clearly manmade instead of just being a product of someone being overtaken by it and from a mechanical standpoint so you can actually have some kind of level design there.,DarkSouls2,chfozcm,2,t5_2vqni

MedLong range wins.   Also if you use Hexes trade Great Resonant Soul when they fire Avelyn.  You WILL outdamage them. I stun lock as they are trying to close with Greatsword Lunge.

981389,0,t1_chfi7ez,gtA cleric can go right into Heides two handing the mace and deal with the knights no problem but swords dont do so well against them.It feels like this basic sentiment remains true for the entire game. While most builds can play effectively clerics seem to be DS easy mode. I swapped from a competent  physical build to a faithstrength build at the end of my first play through. The difference in difficulty of the game between the two is amazing. Things that were routinely giving me trouble are dying before they get near me. Not that I was a slouch with my physical build its just that much easier to kill things when your projectile damage is hitting as hard or harder than a melee weapon. And with the right weapon you dont do a whole lot less melee damage thanks to elemental bonuses. The physical builds are really lackluster once you get to around level  and I can understand why someone who isnt good at this game would become frustrated if they made the mistake of rolling a physical build as their first character.,DarkSouls2,chfubp6,1,t5_2vqni

982274,0,t1_chfu3zu,Falchion is absurd and simply hasnt been discovered yet. At  it does more damage than the Warped Sword ! has EA scaling and has  Bleed damage just as icing on the cake.It doesnt even use that much stamina one possible option is a Stone Ring and Blood Ring with power stance Falchions which lets you dump your entire stamina bar into attacks while theyre staggered and usually bleeds them. Of course this gets less viable if you cant do most or all of their health in one rotation but singleFalchion builds are viable as well.I stumbled onto powerstance Falchions while I was trying to find a powerstance Dex build to replace the atrocious dual Mythas Bent Blades. Theyre fucking awesome  damage on that moveset is ridiculous.EDIT I want to clarify my position a bit. The Falchion is awesome absolutely fantastic weapon. However if youre SL in full Havels with  STRDEX and  INTFAI with MLGS  and a Bat Staff slinging Dark Fog using GRW GRS and Geysers its not going to be that appealing. Neither will it be appealing if youre rocking twin Mundane Avelyns. Powerstancing Falchions wont turn any heads compared to an offhand Monastery  Scimitar either. Unfortunately while Falchions are fantastic like many weapons theyre trying to play not in Dark Souls  but rather in Dark Souls  Con Queso edition. With some adjustments to the dairy deliciousness of the worst offenders Falchion will be amazing but in noholdsbarred PvP... may the Dark shine your way.,DarkSouls2,chfxy0y,18,t5_2vqni

My strategy was to circle it at a sweet spot distance where you are far away enough to easily get out of range when it does its aerial attack but close enough for it to not be able to catch you by panning its forward flame attack. Basically keep circlingand wait for it to make a move if it beats its wings and flies run the hell away if it rears its head you can run in and land a number of attacks depending on how fast your weapon is. Obviously when you run in run to the side somewhat to avoid the stream of flame. Repeat and eventually win as long as you remain in that sweet spot you should be fine. ,DarkSouls2,chiclhs,1,t5_2vqni

So in Harvest Valley we are in the valley aorund a muntain inside the Mountain Mytha made her own castle and then past her castle you go up an elevator and come out in a volcano caldera? Sure lets assume it was not a volcano when they made the Iron Keep. So from Dragnelic Castle which has deep crevices all around I go to the backyard and take an elevator down to a cavern where Amanas Shrine is from there all the way to the back is another place with an infinite pit that we are gonna use as a Crypt.Lets not forget a bit to the west of that you find a mansion at a lower elevation than the castle but once you get past it there is a cool elevator that takes you several dozen kilometers up in the air to stone pillars were dragons nest nothing you have already gone through is able to be seen tho.

Say youre a college student who according to you have all the time in the world Not true by the way. College athletes who use performance drugs get kicked off the teams and often out of the school and by your logic they should have plenty of time to train.VYou dont have to be making a career in sports for cheating to be considered a bad thing. Cheating in a sport is bad no matter what it will always get you kicked out no matter what level. Why are competitive games any different?Your point is what Im arguing against  youre saying its okay because youve already put in time. That doesnt make it okay because youre STILL skipping the build process everyone else has to go through. Its still like saying my time is too valuable to be wasted on this game. Again its like someone saying dude Ive played football all my life i have every right to use steroids instead of spending my time staying in shape. Do you really think that would fly at any level? And AGAIN you dont have to grind for hours to upgrade things. You have Soul Vessels. Farming twinkling titanite doesnt take long at ALL. If you dont want to put in the time then dont play the game competitively. That sounds harsh but I GUARANTEE you that literally ANY other competitive thing would be the same way  if you tell someone you dont have time to put effort into something theyre going to tell you to get gone. If you tell your sports coach I dont have time to train you will get removed from the team. If you tell your music instructor I dont have time to practice then you will be told to quit. Anything where you compete against people career or not WILL require time and effort out of you. If you cant be bothered to put in that time then dont insult the people who do put the time in by cheating just dont play it.If your time is too valuable for you to be playing Dark Souls then dont play Dark Souls. If you want to spend time playing it then play it like everyone else. ,DarkSouls2,chjam04,1,t5_2vqni

Having well north of  duels I can say with personal confidence that nothing is OP except for havel batfogs. Batfogs in general are annoying but its a DPS game I have a fair enough shot at winning but Havel batfogs... Avelyns and even dual avelyns are relatively straightforward to counter. Magic is easier. Scimitar parriers are the funniest to fight due to the added psychological dimension. Against them its either using a fast weapon and attacking with delays or two handing the Syan Halberd and poking.

If you compare to the previous image  you can clearly see that the boot is almost cut in half by the sword compare the size of the boot  pants between image   .Unfortunately thats why grabs make this bullshit feeling there no possibility of it doing just a bit of damage its a very binary move you get grabbed or youre not no alternatives.I also feel that since the beginning of the roll animation seems to be slower than in DaS there is a higher probability of legs being touched after the Iframes period.Edit  to be fair in this sort of binary animation grabnot grab I feel that the hitbox of the grab shouldnt be active on the pursuer sword until the sword is in his final position image  in this case the hitbox of the sword should result in only damage during the swing but idk it may make it too easy to dodge then.,DarkSouls2,chkbx56,1,t5_2vqni

1039237,0,t1_chm5jiq,Its interesting. Ive found the the Rapier to be my favourite parry weapon because of its ability to just guess when people will attack it also feels like a risk to try and do a reaction based parry unless Ive got a Curved weapon. The shields also seem good at the guess based parry Im not sure whats better.The Parrying dagger feels like its in a weird middle ground between Reaction and Guessing. Its a bit too slow to just do it based off of reaction but too slow to do it based off of guessing. The parry frames also dont sync up with the animation making it have a steep learning curve to get used to. The parry frames are right at the beginning of it instead of when you actually parry which I assume Fromsoft put in to make it cope with lag issues or something. Either way the Parry Dagger doesnt feel good to me I think it takes too much skill hehe.,DarkSouls2,chmezaf,1,t5_2vqni

Yes Dark Souls  and Demons Souls have plenty of problems of their own but Dark Souls  unfortunately has way more. The reason why I asked for documentation is because I really want to know what the exact problem is. Is it bad hitboxes as some have suggested? Is it bad coding as the OP suggests? Is it a mix of both? Or is it something else entirely?Basically if we want to cure a sickness we first have to properly diagnose the disease.

1047621,0,t3_263l2g,I think that some enemies have magic resistance. Try using hexes seeing as it is dark dmg. From the description of dark and magic arrows we get hint that dark is good for magic users Amana cheerleaders Najka DiscoSpider and other enemies on the other hand magic arrow  description suggests that dark enemies such as Old dragonslayer and  nashandra would logically be weaker to magic instead of dark. I find that dark hails was amazing to kill Najka. It takes time and slots but with right staff dark sunset  Im not worrying about not doing enough dmg. Affinity is great for crowd control as for instance you are approached by  three to four enemies  affinity may even split and got two of them not usually happens but once affinity is triggered you can target other dude and hit with orb or pre fire hail for spread. Skeleton lord armor description suggests that it has high dark defense therefore magic would be best. Try mixing some pyro in with mixed intfth you should get great dmg.I also noticed that some spells are pvp oriented. Soul spear would do not as much dmg as you would expect against bosses and mobs but phantoms and other players are different story. Besides Great Heavy Soul Arrow has more charges and only IMO little less dmg. ,DarkSouls2,chndasv,0,t5_2vqni

You do everything you can to protect the Blue Acolytes from the Phantoms. Thats the decent thing to do and we Heirs of the Sun do the same thing for the most part. We protect our host no questions asked.But the other half of the time youre no better than the Brotherhood of Blood. You crack your little gems and slip through the cracks between the worlds all so that you can kill the master of whatever world you manage to fall into. You hunt people down without knowing what they did to draw yourself there mindlessly following the orders that your Order provides.Youre murderers not arbiters of justice. You arent Velkas people youre just a bunch of selfrighteous and stuckup peacocks strutting about and acting like youre better than the Brotherhood because you only hunt sinners.If I see anyone coming after my Host if I see a Red Phantom out for blood or a Blue out for justice Im not going to be asking questions. Im going to introduce you to Mr. Greatsword and ensure that the two of you become intimately familiar with one another.I am a Guardian a Protector. I walk alongside people through the Dark places of the world and serve as an conduit for the Suns light. I lend my shield to those who are in need and I bring my blade against those who would harm those I am bound to protect. I will walk people through the Dark no matter what foes attempt to prevent that. If you want to kill someone who is under my Aegis youre going to either have to go through me or take a backstab as you try to run past me.

1058293,0,t1_chojouo,Yeah I am not complaining about it being punishing. I am saying that if the punishment is TOO HUGE then almost nobody will keep going because you will lose so much. If I lose an hour of gameplay in an RPG its unlikely I will ever pick it up again. I lost  hours of gameplay in Chrono Trigger when I first started playing it to a power outage. The thought of going back and having to replay those sections was so offputting I didnt even bother playing it again until almost  years later.Dark Souls as a series hits the right notes of difficulty and lack of punishment for that difficulty. If dying made you instantly lose all your souls it would be far more unforgiving and far less people would enjoy it. There are always people who will keep doing something even though it is unfairly punishing but I personally have many other things I could do I dont play a game if it makes me mad because why would you choose to do something that put you in a bad mood? Basically the whole series hits a perfect balance for me but SM seems like a punishment for something I didnt even do.,DarkSouls2,chokz52,0,t5_2vqni

As a strat try and bait people into thinking youre doing one sorcery eg. HHSA and then switch to another. Try doing that a couple of times with different sorceries and youre gonna get your opponent confused. Also you can cast HHSAHCSM and as your opponent rolls outside of his iframes you hit him with CSS or other spells. Basically its all about timing.  Id advise using a Clear Bluestone Ring  you get it for beating the Skelly Lords in NG or ascetic the nearest bonfire once that works too,DarkSouls2,chpzavb,1,t5_2vqni

Also weapon damaged but not broken get repaired by resting at bonfires. The red bar under your equipped weapon is its durability.

1079853,0,t1_chqzxkd,Mmm no.  Youre wrong.  Lets do some comparisons of actual defense numbers all sets maxedHavels Set Physical  Strike  Slash  Thrust  Weight  Magic  Fire Lightning  Dark Steel set Physical  Strike  Slash  Thrust  Weight  Magic  Fire Lightning  Dark Looking glass set Physical  Strike  Slash  Thrust  Weight . Magic  Fire Lightning  Dark Havels is handsdown the highest defense set in the game.  By a lot.  Other sets of comparable weight dont even come close.  It isnt just a little better than the next best armor that the scrubs would go for its a LOT better than that armor.  Its a huge advantage for the person wearing it.  This is especially true when you consider that its the best at both physical magic and elemental defense at once.  Combined with GMB which it seems almost all its wearers use regularly you can hardly damage them with anything but the strongest weapons in the game and poison.Ive already explained that the weight is meaningless in an environment of unlimited SL and rings to reduce equipment load.  By the time you get to higher level PvP literally anyone who wants can wear full Havels without compromising their playstyle in the slightest.  It should weigh MORE than it does or have less wellrounded defense period.No scrub forced to use a different armor set would have anywhere near the ability to soak up hits the way Havels lets them do it.  Theres no one weapon thats the best in the game theres a toptier of weapons any of which could be considered best for that playstyle.  But thats what balance is all about.

The opponent would either turtle or play much more carefully.At this point I had the choice of eitherDarkdrift  Spiders Silk to bypass their shieldsorUchigatana  Chaos blade for raw damageEvery weapon switch also has the advantage of changing the game and keeping your opponent on their feet.Its incredibly fun to play with a large number of functional weapons with a wide range of movesets and special features. None of those combos necessarily had to be dualwielded either  using a rapier with a katana in the offhand can mean they make up for each others nonpowerstanced weaknesses.Ive heard curved greatswords are great fun too though!

In this respect the Rapier WILL outperform the dagger.Critical damage comes from a hidden modifier. Daggers just have an insanely high critical modifier. In addition rapiers used to be critical kings in DS but they simply dont have that high critical multiplier anymore. Neither criticals nor counter attacks consider fire damage any differently than physical damage or any other element. You shouldnt be only looking at backstab damage here you should be looking at damage with the weapons normal attack and in this respect the rapier will far outperform the dagger hitforhit unless the target has very high fire defense.,DarkSouls2,chrb2p0,2,t5_2vqni

1093316,0,t1_chsjy61,Well....historically speaking halberds and other such polearms were far and away the most popular and dangerous weapons used by the knightly class while on foot. Swords were a secondary weapon only relied upon if something went awry though there were exceptions. Certain soldiers like the German Landsknechts used the large two handed swords modern enthusiasts would come to call Zweihanders either to hold key positions or to break up enemy pike formations ahead of their own lines.Even for conscripted soldiers spears and pikes were the default weapon for their range speed and their ability to be used in formation fighting. This was universal across the world in Japan the number of fighting schools for spears greatly outnumbered those for swords until the Meiji era I think. My Japanese history is a little weaker when it comes to ye olde warfare.In that light it makes sense for the halberd class to be so dangerous. But considering the Zweihander is classified as an ultra greatsword and weighs the same amount as a giant log I dont really think historical accuracy was the primary concern.Edit Spelling,DarkSouls2,chskb7q,32,t5_2vqni

1099171,0,t1_cht2742,In all those encounters you were fighting enemies who died in  hits and the game was set up in such a way that you could segregate the enemies from one another.gtIve gone through the undead burg and the first time you fight a single enemy besides the random rat in the sewer is the hollow that chucks the burning barrel at you. Undead Burg is filled with enemies you kill in  hits. Maybe  hits if they are super powerful. The enemies are also spread out so that even though you are technically fighting  enemies they charge at you  at a time giving you plenty of time to kill one and then fight the next one.gtPhalanxFilled with slow very vulnerable enemies who you could completely ignore if you wanted.gttower knightWhich let you immediate go onto the wall to kill all the archers while the boss could not do much of anything to you. The fight very quickly turned into a v and it was very fair in how it let you deal with the archers.gtgargoylesYou begin the fight against only  gargoyle and the second shows up only after youve been killing the first one for a while. Even so its not nearly as bad as the Gargoyles encounter in Dark Souls  where youll be fighting  at once constantly.Similar deal with the Maneater Gargoyles. You only fight  in the beginning so you get to destroy most of its HP before the second one shows up and even then they have moves where they fly away and give you plenty of space to fight the remaining gargoyle for a while.gtcapraCapra Demon was widely regarded as the worst designed boss fight in Dark Souls and even he only had  dogs who didnt respawn.gttaurusHad archers who you could deal with before the boss even came into the fight. Its VERY different from forcing you to fight multiple enemies at once with no alternatives.gtOampSGranted they are very frustrating but even OampS were designed to be fought in a on system. Ornstein moves very fast and Smough moves very slow giving you plenty of ways to separate Ornstein from Smough. The only time I really got frustrated by this fight was when I tried to kill Smough before killing Ornstein because I wanted Ornsteins amor. Otherwise this fight While being very challenging is still quite fair in how it designed the v.gtnitoNito has some skeletons but gave you plenty of time to kill the Skeletons before the boss came into play. In addition you could make sure the Skeletons stayed dead by using a divine weapon. The fight quickly turned into a v.gt kingsAgain the other kings dont start showing up unless you are very slow and even when they do show up you rarely are in a position where you are fighting multiple kings at once. This is VERY different from Dark Souls  where you are fighting multiple enemies and theres nothing you can do about it.People arent saying that Dark Souls and Demon Souls never had instances where you fought multiple enemies at once. They are saying that Dark Souls and Demon Souls were MUCH more thoughtful about HOW those fights were set up and the vs were designed to be fair to the player rather than Dark Souls  where the designers appeared to have decided Well screw it lets just put some spiders and shit here,DarkSouls2,cht8bg8,11,t5_2vqni

1103364,0,t1_chtocpx,gtOh and one more point theres no reason to try and convince someone who likes SL that SM is better or vica versa. The argument is literally You shouldnt be having fun like this and let me tell you why what I think is fun is right and what you think is fun is wrong. Nobody is wrong here. Thats why a compromise is the best.No.gtSoul Memory is a cancer killing Dark Souls s PVE and PVP alike. It gives characters an expiration date and one that is outside of most players control since the only way to not gain souls is to not play the game. The more you play the closer and closer you get to the magic  Million Souls No Rules Land where most players will be the level cap and will cheerfully molest players that arent. It crushes the PVP metagame by ensuring that players cant decide on their own level caps and play with those it cruses the PVE metagame by ensuring that players who coop will be pushed further and further out of level ranges and perhaps most tellingly of all it doesnt account for Soul Deletion so a character who is still at the starting level with no upgrades can still have hundreds of thousands of souls worth of soul memory and thus be outside of coop ranges. The intended purpose of Soul Memory  to protect newcomers from twinks  has long since become an invalid point since the save editors and mulers are still invading the newbies without repercussions anyway even with Soul Memory in place obstenibly to protect them and the net result is that Soul Memory has ultimately harmed the game far far more than it helped. It needs to go away and our old friend Soul Level matchmaking needs to return from his long hiatus. As it stands Dark Souls  is completely undermined by this botch of a matchmaking system and it needs to go away.,DarkSouls2,chtpj41,2,t5_2vqni

1104600,0,t1_chttw83,A few correctionsgt You will however gain Sin for invading with red eye orbs which can increase the frequency youre invaded.You will only gain Sin when killing the host not for invading alone. Also having more sin doesnt increase the frequency how often you are invaded You get invaded by Blue Sentinels as long as you have enough sin to be counted as Sinner .gt If youre a grey or yellow spirit invader from covenants ...There are no yellow invaders There are White normal and Yellow Heirs of the Sun  Sunbros phantoms other players that one can summon to engage in Jolly Cooperation for help. Then we have Red Phantoms also called Black. They are your standard invaders. You can also summon them on your own if they are using the Red Sign Soapstone to duel with them.  There are also the Blue Sentinels. The good counterpart of the Reds. They will invade Sinners and will often get automatically summoned if you are getting invaded and are in the Way of the Blue covenant.  Grey Phantoms Bell Keepers and Rats will invade you as soon as you trespass their territory in case of the Rats you are actually getting sucked into their world.  Last but not least another type of Grey Phantom The Dragon Remnants. You can summon them like Reds using a RSS to duel them. gt The higher you are the higher range of players you can summonWrong. Being in a higher bracket tier doesnt increases the ranges you can summon. You can only summon players that are in the same or adjacent brackets as you are. gt the higher the opponents soul memory the more souls theyll drop.Also wrong.

1153325,0,t3_27bboi,I think the biggest problem isnt damage output its part of it but having such low amounts for damage bonuses just makes you regret leveling DEX. Say a Falchion  has A DEX scaling. At  DEX youll get about  damage from the stat bonus. A scaling   damage? More than two thirds of the overal damage comes from the base damage of the weapon. Its just disappointing and demotivating to see  points of dexterity amount to that.Why not simply tip the balance and give DEX weapons lower base damage in general with more rewarding stat returns? And as someone else argued there are more DEX weapon counterparts that scale with STR instead and are better as a result because they are stronger.,DarkSouls2,chzd4fe,1,t5_2vqni

The first game did have a shallower and more fluid gradient between game areas that gave Lordran a more realistic feel to it. While this was appreciable in its own way the obvious change in Drangleics level design can also be seen in a positive light. While it may not be as realistic I think it gives the game world a more fantasy feel  More so than in DaS. While Im playing the second game I feel like Im a character in a dream or something  areas blurring more suddenly from one to the next.

I know in DS there was some copy cat builds pretty much before the dark wood grain ring patch but it was still more variable then this shit.      At least havaleyn builds are less common. Great Resonant soul still needs to be nerfed its hit box and tracking is insane. The right angel lightning spears is absurd. Havelmages are bullshit and annoying. Stacking multiple miracle buffs and hex buffs is insane. Its annoying to be spammed by a hexer over and over and over again or havel mages. Personally I think this is a DIRECT result of using SM for match making that causes the absurd amount of havel builds. Because of that top tier match making if you get stuck near the bottom everyone above you is so over leveled they can run these massive armor mage builds. If it was level based like it used to be then wed have more even mix of builds.,DarkSouls2,ci0dvv5,0,t5_2vqni

1165215,0,t3_27gspd,Ive been using the Partizan frequently lately and Im pretty impressed.The pokey pokes arent exactly equal in overpoweredness of the dual halberd poke and the sweep attacks arent particularly as wide and reliable as a greatsword swing.  However the reach of the weapon is pretty absurd and the fact that you can mix up sweeps and pokes at will can really catch people off guard. In addition the damage isnt particularly awful.  If you can combine it out with a Leo Ring you can batchsteppoke for a counter or just avoid and counter and get some massive damage against the shorterranged FotM weapons.Honestly my main problem with it is that everyone circles to the left and backs away endlessly with their shield up because they dont know what to expect out of the spear.  Its not necessarily a question of me not being able to beat these people its just a pain in the ass to have to spend the next  minutes rushing them down while they hide behind Havels Greatshield.,DarkSouls2,ci0pfly,2,t5_2vqni

1172463,0,t3_27j4gr,Gyrm Shield and Kings Mirror are good options when you get them. Most mobs and bosses can be blocked with these shields.In NG a lot of new enemy phantoms not to mention the dragonbro mobs at Dragon Shrine start guard breaking. Lances are great against these guys especially poisoned lances. One or two R hits and they get poisoned and you can sit back with your shield up and chip away at them.The problem with tank builds though is that as the game progresses it gets much harder for you than more nimble builds because you have to aggro one enemy at a time and they take longer and longer to kill. If youre a tank  or more enemies can mean a very  fast death no matter how high your armor and HP is.,DarkSouls2,ci1itf2,1,t5_2vqni

1172677,0,t3_27jcyk,Dark souls  was definitely a brilliant game. The multiplayer was engrossing and fun yes there are issues with it but theyll fix it in a few more patches Im sure. I like the new mechanics in combat dual welding and bows are now fun and balanced there are also good additions like lighting doing extra damage in water as well as gameplay ascetics torches etc.. Bosses are interesting and well designed. The game is packed with lore and like the original Dark Souls there is so much to think about for days on end. But there are definitely things that I miss from the prequel. You dont have fast travel until half way through and that definitely added a different experience to exploration you feel the curiosity and dread at the same time when you wander into a new place that is missing in DS as someone pointed out in another thread the castleamanacrypt journey would definitely be fun without fast travel. Also I miss the unique dark atmosphere and the sense of loneliness you felt it in Lordran Dragleic seems so much  less darker it is still an amazing place! and the NPCs just come and stay in Majula forever in DS they just came to Firelink for a temporary respite before they went about their quest and are eventually overtaken by the curse. Also the design in DS was architecturally correct in DS I just t cant figure where the fuck Iron Keep is because I see nothing behind Earthen Peak. And to end this wall of text Id like to say that DS menu theme was so much better...so dark so eerie. When I first got that game and hit New Game and that thing started playing I knew that game was boss before anything even started. ,DarkSouls2,ci1jok0,2,t5_2vqni

In DS I was stuck at Capra for a while.

Not one.  I bought it tried to play it for a few hours gave up. I still dont know why I picked it up a year later and tried it again.

After getting to rank  in heirs of the sun pilgrims of the dark or the dragon covenant all of which are very quickly maxed out theres really very little reason to stick with them which is a shame. Itd be nice if every covenant had a sort of endgame that could continously reward covenant play.Like for example the sunbros should be able to use sunlight medals as consumables similar to tokens of fidelity but the healing should be more powerful. The dragons should be able to buy something maybe just consumables with surplus dragon scales. Etc. Im unsure how continued pilgrims of the dark play would work though. Maybe the black spirits would start dropping something other than bonfire ascetics or in addition to the bonfire ascetics? Its a bit shortlived that covenant.,DarkSouls2,ci4q6xr,1,t5_2vqni

1201660,0,t1_ci4sy5h,I played Dark Souls for upwards of  hours. You could definitely get plentiful PvP beyond SL.If you wanted to get to SL then no there werent many people at that level because there was practically no point of leveling up to that point. The only reason anybody goes that high in DKS is because they have to in order to compete with the amount of health stamina and equipment load that their opponents will have. Even in DKS theres virtually no reason to ever go beyond SL just for the purposes of expanding your build itself. After that point its just a dick measuring contest for all intents and purposes. Its people getting more HP just because other people got more HP. Its sort of like the people who already have a  sq ft house with everything you could want in it. But then their neighbor goes and gets a  sq ft house which has nothing that the  sq ft house doesnt havethe only difference is it just has two of everything for no purpose other than to just be bigger. To compete the first couple now builds a  sq ft house which is effectively just four copies of their original house and so on.Theyre gaining absolutely nothing by building bigger and bigger houses. They already had an indoor pool and a game room in the original  sq ft house. Now they have four pools and four game rooms. Theyre just doing it to keep up with each other for really silly reasons.,DarkSouls2,ci4szn2,1,t5_2vqni

So the DoP Rat area is already optional. The whole Grave of Saints is skipable if you jump down one more floor before entering.

The actual fight was very challenging and it felt like such an accomplishment to me taking him down solo. Sure The Lost Sinner is an early game boss but it felt like they tried to recreate the Artorias boss fight in her design but just kinda failed. I think the Lost Sinner fight should have been more aggressive there were too many moments where she stops jumps back and then just dashes again.

1236119,0,t3_2891yi,I also hit rank  in BoB today and I feel I should share my slightly different experience. I am SL  and using a drake keeper sword as my primary weapon. I play fashion souls so no Havels here. I think OP may be exaggerating somewhat by saying that your BoB arena opponents will be on average hundreds of levels higher than you. Yes you will encounter SL  full Havels power stanced dual helix halberds with  affinity orbs but they are not the norm. I actually felt I encountered just as many low SL characters I assume they are low level if they are still rocking Drangleic swordshieldarmor as I did super high SL ones. The vast majority of my opponents seemed relatively close to my SL. Katana sprint attack spam is rampant but you get used to that. OP is still absolutely right that its a grind but perhaps not quite as soul crushing as a never ending Havel parade. That sweet sweet aura makes it all worthwhile though.,DarkSouls2,ci8ohlh,2,t5_2vqni

Ive personally felt that a balanced build either all ss I had all s and would use the  faithint rings for some spell combinations was the way to go. Its nice being that adaptable. Do you find the Stone Ring really that mandatory? For me using lighter less poisebreaking weapons it doesnt seem to matter. Either he has so much poise Id never break it anyway or hes got so little Id break it regardless. Id like to hear your thoughts on it. Which scythe are you using currently? I got quite a bit of mileage out of my SoNA before I made a dark bone scythe getting  hit light attack stunlocks was sometimes enough to win a fight outright. Those things are quick.Then again Im also a total slave to my shield.

I remember spending hours looking for people to invade in and nongankforest areas in ds. Why? Because I didnt have a soul level close to anyone else. The reason there was even a meta level picked in the first place was because it was the only way for people to pvp with other people in the online community reliably.  just got picked because that was a level people more than not agreed on. Now with both server rings and larger brackets which means we only have to pick general areas to meet up in like the pursuer platform.tldr The sl meta was not created for balancing or fair builds but was just the ds equivalent of the name engraved ring.

1265176,0,t1_cibviwd,I think you have some number wrong on how different tiers are combined. Red eye orb is up   down  so you cant invade a level  while youll be invaded by lower level characters. If SL  is tier  you can invade up to tier  which is still reasonable. The HUGE gap is in tier  which is enormous compared to previous ones. This would be an issue only for dragon duels. If we want SL  to be the optimal meta it should be at the very top of tier  I think so that SL  would be tier . This way there is a huge penalty for overleveling to SL  as you would be paired to people more than  levels higher than you when invading.,DarkSouls2,ciby5bl,1,t5_2vqni

1269087,0,t3_28ml3a,Get yourself a buckler used it for the first time yesterday while duelling with a friend and parried like  times in a very short time span. The parry window is long but the startup is slow so better to parry a little too early than a little too late. Which also means you need to parry on anticipation. Its easy to bait people just purposely miss them and then parry when they try to counter. I learned a lot yesterday Before yesterday I have only ever parried someone once before in PVP and it was by accident was using Espada Ropera and forgot the strong attack was parry.. QUESTION is the buckler different than the watchers shield as far as parrying goes? If not I would def prefer the watchers shield,DarkSouls2,cice0c1,2,t5_2vqni

1271638,0,t3_28m7jg,I guess Ill chime in with my experience regarding corrupted saves as well.Mild Spoilers BelowI was farming the Shadow Set from the adds on the Flexile Sentry boss fight they appear on Bonfire Intensity  and upwards.  After killing the adds you can select Quit Game before killing the boss.  That way when you load your save youll be on the docks right before the ship.  Then enter the boss area again and the adds will have respawned.  This simplified things a lot since it meant I didnt need to run back through the area from the bonfire or use any Bonfire Ascetics.Unfortunately on my last attempt I was poisoned by the adds and had very low health.  I hit Quit Game and confirmed as fast as I could.  The screen faded out with my health bar pretty much empty and I loaded into the title screen.  After that any time I tried to load that character the game would crash to desktop.  I can only guess that during the autosave that happens when you quit I had also died from the poison and the game then tried to run another autosave for my death before the previous one had finished which led to that characters save becoming corrupted.  My first character SL over  hours and no backups...After that I had to take a break from the game for a while.  Now Im well into my second character and Ive made regular backups after every play session or major milestone.,DarkSouls2,cicocyq,2,t5_2vqni

In PvE the bow is still a wreckening machine. Third you can hold arrows on the string without firing by holding the fire button. Lets you play on nerves of the opponent. Hold an arrow wait for him to roll fire when his Iframes end and he cant roll again. Get a Greatbow of any kind for maximum swag and nerve racking when aiming.

1325712,0,t1_ciio5gf,I kinda wish Capcom go ahead and make Dragon Dogma  with Monster Hunter mechanic which quite similar to Souls.Dragon Dogma itself is a quite solid game especially if we view it from the Archer and Magician mechanic the bow have so many great moveset and magic attack like Meteor and Hurricane is so cool looking and devastating. The climbingclinginglifting mechanic probably the most innovative features for ARPG genre recently. It add so many dimension to the gameplay and how the player approach the combat. Exp. Cling and stab a flying Griffin until shes crash down. Climb a tall structure and snipe Chimnera underneath with a bow. Grab a goblin and throw him down into the Abyss.. So many way to play with these three new features introduced.But the melee combat really need to be improved. Some idea from my part Dodging shouldnt be limited to Assassin class only. All class should have an evasive move. The impact thing like staggered animation and weight feeling of heavy weapon is needed.  Lockon should be added since some enemy is smaller than the player making it easier to miss an attack. Add more weapons moveset add parry as well..  Plunging attack would be great addition too.Too bad Capcom went with Deep Down and mention no more about Dragon Dogma since I think Dragon Dogma have a potential to be a golden egg of game if all the combat mechanic is improved even more.,DarkSouls2,ciircsi,2,t5_2vqni

I was powerstancing a Lightning Bandit Greataxe  and Lightning Greatsword  to good effect with SLB on the LGS it was dealing very high AR I went back to fight the gargoyles at the end of NG and killed them all before they could even attack.Then i tried some PVP and got rekt was way too slow and predictable and id limited myself to Great Lightning Spear and SLB for miracles. Spears are just.. well.. meh in PVP. The equivalent of oh youre really far away ill at least do something more interesting than just wait for you to get hereThats the point i switched to the DGS . At SL its got an AR of  without the buff active so only about  points short of what my Lightning Greatsword was doing but had the benefit of a much more varied moveset and faster swingless stamina consumption. The respec i did also meant wasted powerstance points could be placed into VIG and ADP instead and im moving a lot more freely now and the weight reduction from changing weaponry allows for a Watchdragon Parma and heavier armour currently the Alonne Captain chest  as opposed to shirtless.The powerstance setup i had was great for PVE destroyed a lot of things very quickly and when I used Sunlight Spear it became a little too easy tbh. But going forward for PVP ill be using the DGS the extra speed makes the world of difference and that S scaling and selfbuff means I free up an attunement slot for a spot of pyromancy for variety.TLDR What youre doing is probably the most viable STRFAI setup for PVP,DarkSouls2,cimxx6n,2,t5_2vqni

Every time we find a shard the herald transfers some of its soul into our bottle. The reason we only start with one sippy is because the kingdom fell far longer ago than in the first game. So our bottle this time around is much older and damaged. The sublime bone dust is around because we lost the rite of kindling with the loss of humanity. ,DarkSouls2,cin64t9,9,t5_2vqni

1380481,0,t3_29wyg7,It is a very entertaining and low risk way to get into pvp and I recommend it to any casual player who is in it for the fun. Try hards are rare there is no competition the chunks are extremely helpful...It is very chaotic and very unfair to the hosts so dont make things too hard or be sadistic if you can help it. If my fellow grey just spammed spells while I was fighting a host I would and have stopped combat to let the host kill him. Its tedious and no fun for anyone.There are two distinct zones luna and sol. Luna is a big deal. People are there for bosses. If you invade here realize that you are actually blocking progress in game. Optional progress but progress. This means you deal with two kinds of people new players who arent super prepared for PVP and those seeking vengence with specialized builds. Either way dont feel bad if you lose someone elses day got a little better.Belfry Sol is far more casual people generally know what theyre getting into when they play here. Its the most relaxed pvp environment for invaders save for when a red shows up and makes it a free for all and the most challenging and exhilarating pvp experience for a world master. I highly recommend wearing a bell ring while hanging out at the iron keep bridge to try and get there.Oh and the wait time on invasions tends to be under  minutes so you wont be too bored.,DarkSouls2,cipbta2,2,t5_2vqni

1384487,0,t3_29ygl6,Reapers are extremely bad. You can win with them but this is despite  the weapon you are using. The Scythe of Want is decent the damage is nice and the criticals are very high but all the others are so bad. Their sweet spots are quite restrictive and hard to manage against very mobile opponents. Some reapers like the Full Moon Sickle and the Crescent Sickle have what initially looks like a better moveset but then it turns out that their tracking is nonexistant.They should do way more damage if they hit with the sweet spot. For example the Mastodon Halberd has it too but youre rewarded with excellent damage if you manage to hit with the blade meanwhile reapers do extremely bad damage which goes up to decent at most if you manage to get a proper hit.Crescent Axe also has the same issue where the damage and poisebreak is negligible unless you hit with the blade and even then the damage is not particularly high but at least it has a much better moveset than scythes and it has access to a really powerful spinwin. ,DarkSouls2,ciptu0h,1,t5_2vqni

1402245,0,t3_2a69fi,I went and tested it a little. I replied to a few other comments but Ill sum it up here.The spikes in Brightstone indeed do not damage you while in the menu.  If you are not in the menu you can not take damage by not doingusing anything that causes character movement.  Any action that causes movement even just how your character shifts a bit from the menu stance back to normal causes damage.  You also take damage during animations using a homeward bonefeather for example you take hits throughout.  The spikes do not do durability damage as far as I can tell. My equipment took no damage while I was on the spikes from  hp to .I also had a look at the acid pool in Aldia and the wall spikes in that room and neither of these are effected by being in the menu.So my guess is that since the spikes in Brightstone do their damage when you are moving that movement isnt being properly registered by them when you are in the menu.  I dont know of any other floor hazards that register only when you are moving so it may be a bug confined to only those spikes. Either way the damage they do is too low for this to ever really be useful in PvEPvP at least in my opinion.  No other types of damage self inflicted by immolation other hazards or npc enemies that I tested was effected by being in the menu.If there are any similar hazards that have any effect only when you are moving let me know and I can check them as well.,DarkSouls2,cis1vav,10,t5_2vqni

He was originally a common swordsman his actual starting class who eventually wandered into the Earthen Peak where he was captured and horribly disfigured by Mytha the Manikin mask description does say she torn off their faces. But instead of submitting to her and becoming another one of her puppets he developed an obsession with fire after finding a discarded pyromancy glove and nearly burnt down the mill.After that incident he was brought back to Majula and thrown into the Pit on the orders of the Baneful Queen.

1458208,0,t1_ciyjtxz,Well...its all just assumptions currently as we dont really know. The only thing that was stated in the article is that it could potentially save a character on the edge of death. Which is relatively vague to begin with. It doesnt state that the spell activates on death or the any special requirements that may cause its activation and whether or not it would even resurrect. However if this spell is similar to Second Chance from DeS and if its easily obtained it could be very problematic... as most players seem to like to walk around as over leveled unkillable tanks anyways. If anyone does not have an fatal attack whatever that could be in correlation to this new spell to combat this it would be widely used in PVP as it effectively saves you from death. To put it into perspective  of PVP builds in DeS ran around with the second chance miracle. It was extremely commonplace but that game also had many limitations towards build options and something was almost always sacrificed. When it comes to DS and Soul Memory and the lot. A spell like second chance would already abuse a system that is being abused due to everyone just leveling and getting everything they want anyways. This spell could also be a nightmare for players that have to regularly combat players using antibackstab gear and stack buffs assuming you can stack it as it seems fine for everything else in this game. Once again this is all speculation as we dont really know the properties of this spell but even if it is randomized and it does as you state but somehow can be successful for PVP. The meta would change entirely due to this spells inclusion as it did for DeS PVP.,DarkSouls2,ciz289d,1,t5_2vqni

1480493,0,t1_cj1b5z7,Yes thats correct.  And thats exactly what the parrying dagger is in Dark Souls .  A parrying dagger is the best dagger for parrying but its not universally better than everything else on the planet for parrying.    A rapier is a superior parrying weapon because you can control range AND you have the dome over your hand that allows you to catch the blade early allow it to slide down your blade and then deflect it at the end.  A curved sword is better at parrying because it is light weight allows you to control space and allows you to utilize the curve of the blade to deflect your opponents blade in ways they dont expect.  A smallmedium shield is better at parrying because it gives you a safe amount of surface area by which you can strike your opponents blade away.    All of these are unequivocally better than a parrying dagger at parrying.  But they all require carrying something heaviermore unwieldy.  But if you want something light weight that you can carry on your leg or belt a parrying dagger can be pretty awesome.    Ultimately having a blade with RANGE creates a better scenario for parrying than any dagger ever can no matter how it is designed because it allows you to parry at a safer range.  And thats not even getting into the other aspects of parrying like parrying at various angles which a parrying dagger is extremely limited.  With a rapier or curved sword you can parry a whole variety of swings from and to all different directions.  A parrying dagger is relatively limited in its capacity to only catch certain types of strikes and even then it has to be done with extreme precision given how close the blade must come to your hand in order to succeed.  Even some wooden weapons like bos can be better at parrying than a parrying dagger though of course they have a chance of breaking quickly.    Its absolutely absurd to try to assert that just because something is called a parrying dagger that you assume it is universally the best item in the real or virtual world for parrying.  All that means is that its a dagger specifically designed for parrying.  Why do they make a special dagger for parrying as opposed to calling rapiers or scimitars parrying rapiers or parrying scimitars you ask?  Well because by default daggers pretty much fucking suck at parrying and are extremely dangerous to use in such a situation.  The parrying dagger was designed to mitigate that danger on a weapon that is otherwise not designed to do so.  However a rapier scimitar buckler any smallmedium shield are all designed with parrying in mind by default and dont need special versions of said weaponry to do so.    sigh.  Does that help?  ,DarkSouls2,cj1uswv,1,t5_2vqni

1527647,0,t1_cj7r51d,I began intending to do a percentage however it seems it has a high point and a low point of activation. These clips are from when it was on a roll. I wondered ifIs there a time cycle where it spikes and dips like for some amount of time it on  and then the low times it wont deflect at allIs there a trigger to build it up to peak level of deflection that resets after a certain amount of successful deflectionsI had about  hours of play with this ring. It seemed in the end it is really going to be random when it activates or doesnt. So I wouldnt rely on it to save you from your first hit of a spell but I would definitely use it in areas with multiple casters like I amana. I bet it was an even  success rate there.

A build that stacks on a darkbuffed mundane shadow dagger and carries the monastery scimitar and doesnt do anything but backstabbing or riposting.Extra scum points for stacking poise with an antibackstab protection stacking defensive buffs etc. Basically I feel that these people want to exempt themselves from the same mechanics they seek to exploit.

1590251,0,t1_cjfk2z6,Actually while its true that SL is most definitely my opinion on OP not the OP type of unbeatable but the OP type of no longer being a true build its also community consensus. The point I was making in my statements before is that IF there was SL matchmaking the meta would be  or even below it not my opinion but a fact since this was actually already established within the first  weeks. On top of that if someone wants to participate in the official Fightclubs its all SL types. By this I can say that while its my opinion that SL is OP for a build its the community that decided collectively that its OP for Meta. I can assure you there were people that wanted high level PVP in DeS and DkS  as well but the meta basically made sure no such thing existed unless people actually found each other.       What I seem to read from what youre saying is that youre  misunderstanding my point. Im not saying SL is OP in general or on all occasions. Hell I even put more SM to my MetaCap simply to face more SLs because those are the most fun people to face! Not generally OP just fun builds and most avid players. However Im merely pointing out that it would never hit meta status. Its simply being too OP for such a status.    What destroys high SM PVP is the SL FotM award characters running around. That is the truly OP part of the game. When you can go Mundane  then there really is nothing to do than laugh it off.

1618742,0,t3_2cuk9q,I played the game to completion and I enjoyed myself for a while but ended up loathing the game toward the end and had to force myself to finish it. There are a few reasons for this but the biggest one for me was the crafting system. Ill start by explaining how I was lead into the crafting system.I played the game on the hardest difficulty so getting hit really wasnt an option. I realized pretty quickly that rolling and dodging wasnt very reliable for avoiding damage. Sure it worked from time to time but I found myself getting hit in situations where I really couldnt afford it. You are basically forced into using a shield and getting used to the parrying mechanic which I disliked a lot. I didnt like being forced to do this so I shifted my attention to the crafting system for a solution. Perhaps I could reduce incoming damage enough to counteract some of the damage I was taking from attempting to dodge attacks.The crafting system is completely broken. When I first saw it I was pretty excited to be able to really customize my gear to get exactly what I wanted out of my character. I spent maybe  minutes to an hour with it once I had collected lots of crafting materials toward the end of the game. The result was that my character became immune to all forms of damage had a  chance to crit and oneshotted anything in the game including most bosses. I am really into minmaxing and getting the most out of my character in a game and that was not the best choice for Kingdoms of Amalur. I basically ruined the game for myself because I had created a godmode without breaking any rules set by the game.TLDR  Spent some time with the crafting system became god. Ruined the game for myself.  would not craft again.,DarkSouls2,cjj7ivv,2,t5_2vqni

All they would have to do is make the SM value equivalent to the amount of souls spent on leveling and add SM tiers based on the invasion system of Dark Souls . The reason I say that this would be pretty easy is because metacap does exactly this proving that it could be an easily resolved issue if FROM would be willing to change it. Further balance patches would have to occur after that but proper SMSL optimization would make the game  times better than it currently is.,DarkSouls2,cjjwejd,1,t5_2vqni

1638215,0,t1_cjlndry,Cheating in a competitive environment is having any competitive advantage over another player. This means aesthetics arent cheating. CHEATING means having some sort of advantage. Breaking the game is not cheating. You get absolutely no advantage from doing any of this. In fact the player in the video is actually impared by their hacks as their fire attacks do very little damage because the blue flame has no flame modifier.THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHEATING AND HACKING.Hacking just means breaking into the game and altering aspects of it.Cheating is using hacks to achieve some form of advantage in PvE or PvP.Just because it breaks the rules or its hacking does not make it inherently bad. You have offered no evidence to the fact that hacking is bad. If you say its wrong then explain exactly why its wrong. Just because you say its wrong doesnt mean I have to believe it if you dont offer irrefutable arguments as to why it is wrong.My example about the technological literacy of the people who manipulate the game is to explain that anyone legitimately interested in altering the game is not going to be a cheater. Theyre going to be doing more interesting things. Its the scumbags that turn on infinite health and  shot kills in PvP that you need to be mad at not everyone who used cheat engine ever. Stop generalizing people. Im seriously surprised at how hackerphobic you all are. Someone modifies their character just to look a little cooler and everyone cries CHEATER CHEATER without a second thought to how this actually has no impact on the actual fight.

I promise youll pretty much take them out before they can land a hit.Other players not following the meta for PVP? Thats a selfimposed restriction from a mod.

Assuming you have a daggerknife for ripostes in a slot and the aforementioned  items spell catalyst greatsword whip that still leaves you with two slots for a primary build.So you have your main build for jollygood patontheback fight clubbing and you have the counters to the most common OP builds.As someone else said none of the builds really bothered me much.

1657121,0,t3_2dc19i,I agree.  This is one of the reasons I dont like doing high SM level pvp.  mil is where Id like to be but I normally do sub mil.  Example  I invade on my mil SM character.  I invade in the Servants Quarter.  I spawn on top of the stairs takes me secs to get to the bonfire room.  When Im there I see a fully buffed guy.  We proceed to chop it out and after him healing twice I get a No Way gesture after I die.  Lil salty.  I understand I was the invader and they can do whatnot to get rid of me its annoying still.Example  Im invaded in servants quarters okay Ima go down the ladder since its a nice big easy mode area.  minutes later fully buffed guy comes sliding down the ladder.Buffs are a crutch.  I dont play with them.  And I agree with the weapon switching.  Ive gotten a lot better with using various weapons and its much easier to actually fool people or to adjust to the situation environ.

1663122,0,t3_2den3u,Alright. Im going to try to answer these for the discussion in order from A to D so lets get started.A As far as the Iron King being short sighted. My personal opinion is that of this. The Old Iron King in his lust for ore delved too greedily and too deep sound familiar and it is my opinion that the Smelter Demon was awakened by the Old Iron King and his mining operations a la Balrog.B I think that the castle might have sunk because of both of these. If the foundation was weak and the lava was eating away beneath it then that combined with the weight of the keep remember its made of iron would have caused it to sink. Smelter could have helped because with him nothing could be done about the sinking and obviously the process is slow given that we have time to walk about in the Keep.C I believe that Smelter would have been sleeping in the ground before he appeared or perhaps he was a guardian of some sort. I know Demons and Dark Souls arent related but in Demons Souls blacksmith Ed says that ores are transmogrified sprites. If this holds true in Dark Souls than it could be reasoned that either Smelter is one such sprite or that he is some sort of guardian to the sprites that are the ore again not claiming any truth to this just a fun little theory.D I dont believe that the smelter is a giant. There are simply too many things to the contrary like you said his face is only similar. Also the fact that hes alone would lead me to believe that hes not. I dont think its in the style of the giants to fight alone. Just look at the memories. As far as his name Smelter Demon is exactly what leads me to believe he lurked in the ground and was uncovered by the Old Iron King. To reinforce this Ill bring up the Balrog again. It was a demonlike creature lurking deep beneath the Mines of Moria and was uncovered by the Dwarves leading to their demise. Also I do not believe that his appearance in the Iron Keep is related at all to Vendricks actions against the giants. Its my personal opinion that the fall of the Iron Keep predates Vendricks rule. holy hell that was long I sure do like to talk dont I? Sorry bout that ,DarkSouls2,cjosrcv,46,t5_2vqni

1714255,0,t3_2e0xiq,Even without the Monaparry Spinitar curved swords in general are too easy to parry with. There are actually way too many parry tools in this game and the ones we have make no sense in relation to each other. Curved swords have better parrying ability than parrying daggers and bucklers both of which are designed to parry. Curved swords have potential to do insane damage AND they have the best parry frames? Come on. Rapiers have an identical parrying animation as parrying daggers which completely invalidates any reason to use parrying daggers over rapiers. The rapier for example is literally just a big parrying dagger. Better range and damage plus it only weighs . so there is no disadvantage I can think of to using it. No one should ever even use the buckler because you can replace it with a magic magic shield or a dark transgressors shield.  magicdark resistances and identical parry frames to the shield which is designed to parry. Its essentially the same problem that the parrying dagger has with rapiers only with defense instead of attack.How it should be Curved swords shouldnt be able to parry. Instead their LH R is replaced with an attack. That or they should give it short parry frames that arent really desirable over parrying oriented weapons. Rapiers should have slightly better parry frames than longswords but less parry frames than the parrying dagger. That way they still have parrying potential but the parrying dagger still fills the role it was designed to fill. The buckler and target shield should be the only shields with long parry frames. Everything else should be given the standard medium shield parry animation so parrying shields still fill their role.,DarkSouls2,cjv8sjn,3,t5_2vqni

1732297,0,t3_2ea8c9,Well most melee weapons are pretty fun and almost all of them are viable.The following weapons however come heavily recommend by me.The sun swordQuick fast and high damaging with an amazingly fast running attack which makes it truly shine. I frame their first attack with a backstep and interrupt their second hit by hitting them first.The chaos bladeWith  counter good scaling and good base damage this will wipe foes out if played right.The warped swordWith  counter and a great h moveset with the constant threat of parries this is a force to be reckoned with.The manikin knife With  counter and high damage base damage on a mundane build this weapon can quickly clean up foes that make mistakes. Its a very fast weapon with decent reach for its excellent diverse moveset. The constant threat of near HKO soon to be changed! backstabs makes this weapon even more threatening.The ruler greatswordIt has relatively short reach for a greatsword but it deals immense damage and has a good moveset. Its an excellent starting weapon for learning how to pvp.Builds are relatively simple.Get  vigor and  agility and then get any relevant scalingequip requirements for whichever weapon you are using.After that spend as much as you can in vitality and endurance so you can equip good armors and keep swinging at your foes.This kind of a build is very simple but its also very reliable and will consistently win pvp in the right hands.,DarkSouls2,cjxir2m,1,t5_2vqni

1745190,0,t3_2efyyp,gt How could Vendrick have ruled over the territory the game covers when it seems half of it was covered by the former kingdoms of Venn and Alken? For all his weakness Vendrick seems like a fairly honorable man so would he indulge or even encourage the atrocities against the undead that occurred under the Iron King?Im pretty sure the kingdoms of Alken and Venn as well as the Old Iron King and his rule were all before Vendrick came to Drangleic or at the very least before he built his kingdom. Vendrick was also not a very honorable man as he invaded the land of the giants with no provocation at all sent the Drakeblood Knights down into Shulva for whatever reason maybe to obtain a dragon egg from Sinh and disposed off large quantities of cursed ones down the hole in Majula to try and contain the outbreak of the curse. We also know that he is involved either directly or indirectly with whatever happened to the Old Iron and Ivory Kings. On Tuesday we will likely learn about Vendricks involvement if any with the former.gt Why would he round up the undead into the Bastille if he himself was undead?Undead humans are cursed. Vendrick is a human but his wondrous soul kept him from going hollow for far longer than a regular human. When the curse broke out in Drangleic he wanted to contain it and find a solution. The Lost Bastille was already there and had been there for a very long time. It has been used to house cursed undead for far longer than Drangleic has existed as told by Straid. Vendrick probably went why not and shipped cursed undead from NoMans Wharf with the Flexile Sentry serving as the overseer for this process. The first humans to exhibit the curse of undead were also thrown down the pit in Majula with a whole bunch of Aldias discarded experiments. The wooden structures in the Gutter are their attempt at getting out.gt We are told he was less of a king than we imagine. We assume this is because he could not make the final sacrifice. But it seems more like we keep imagining him as a king on par with Gwen when in fact he was more on par with the Kings of New Londo. Vendrick was human just like the cursed undead. He vanquished four great ones collected a great amount of souls and made his way to the Kiln of the First Flame aka the Throne of Want. Once there he realized that he was supposed to burn his nowwondrous soul to reignite the First Flame and start a new age of fire. This would stave off the curse and humans wouldnt hollow anymore. Instead of doing that he NOPEd the fuck out and started looking into an alternative. From here we have his research into dragons with Aldia. Him and Aldia are responsible for the Emerald Herald a halfdragon Fire Keeper. Since real dragons are eternal everlasting and exist outside of the cycle of fire and dark they hoped that a halfdragon Fire Keeper could keep the First Flame burning forever. They of course failed as the Emerald Herald herself tells you when you are on your way to the Throne of Want Giants Kindship in hand.,DarkSouls2,cjz54qg,15,t5_2vqni

I added it to the Iffy section for the changing directions based on what hand is used argument.As for crazy fast attackers my experience shows they are spammers and simple dodgepunish is all that is needed to seriously change their game.

Breakable walls still need either to be hit or to have an oil barrel explode near them explode oil barrels with large weapons or fire damage of any kindYou can now drop down ladders and slide down them. The way yous lid down ladders in DS will now make you drop down. Hold the sprint key and then down to slide down ladders no stamina costAlso you can sprint up ladders by doing the same but hold up which uses stamina.You can estus on ladders.ADP and to a lesser extent ATN influence how many iframes your rolls have by increasing the agility stat. At the start your rolls will be far weaker than what they started off as in DS so make sure to increase Agility. Every  levels in Agility you gain more iframes generally speaking but ONLY every  any other increment does pretty much nothing.You can aim with crossbows.You start with  gulp of Estus. Find shards and bring them to a certain somebody to increase how many gulps youve got.You can parry spells with certain shields.Being cursed isnt an instant kill thats petrification now. Cursed simply hollows you down a stage. Hollowing is a gradual process each time you die or get cursed your hollow stage goes one higher. Each hollow stage you accrue makes you look more hollow and also removes  from your maximum health.

And skilled players can easily switch to everything they need midfight so omnibuilds exists.In Dark Souls  you had to decide what you want to use on your build. If you want to use strength weapons with a lot of armor you couldnt fast roll. If you want to be fast you had to sacrifice defense and use light armor. If you wanted to use magic you had to put points into int and dex for casting power and speed so you had to decide what to sacrifice. HP stamina or defense.

Only Copper oxidizes as the green that the Old Knights seem to have turned.  So there are a handful of explanations here.   One  The OIK was trying to reproduce the great timeless knights of Heide during the peak of his power.   Two  Heide was part of the OIKs territory and they were of his creation while From just didnt do their homework or thought big brown soldiers would look silly. Three  The OIK was actually at war with Heide for one reason or another and thus once again they are his soldiers and From merely decided either by mistake or artistic choice to make them more akin to Copper than Iron.Or Im just looking into this a little too much.,DarkSouls2,ck6ucc6,5,t5_2vqni

This also applies to heavy weapon builds vs high ADP players  the can chug and roll faster than a man in armor can turn around the guy and slowstab no matter how close he is. I feel my solution would help all builds to be effective when dealing with healing not just casters that can forbidden sun. I am okay with healing during invasions  but I am talking about punishing the mechanic than punishing the meta. You mentioned it being okay to sip when an invader makes distance  I encourage that I am saying if two players are close to eachother and one is ironclad they should be able to be punished from close range  it is fine if an invador makes the mistake of keeping distance.,DarkSouls2,ck7s4ew,6,t5_2vqni

1829829,0,t3_2fis8n,If youre going for weapons that are less common Drakewing Ultra Greatsword is a dex scaling ultra with a sweet HR projectile move. You could also go for the Royal Dirk. Its a dagger thats made for fighting instead of backstabbing. It has a  counter modifier and is fast and deadly when twohanded. Its the second to longest dagger and requires an aggressive playstyle. Its honestly my favorite weapon at this point in time.Theres also the Key to the Embedded and the Flamberge. Both are great in different ways. Flamberge has higher AR and a longer range but it doesnt have any counter modifier so all counter hits will do the same as a regular attack. Standard greatsword. I personally prefer the Key to the Embedded. Yes it is shorter by quite a bit and yes the AR is a bit lower. BUT it also has a  counter modifier. You do have to play this weapon slightly differently than the Flamberge but I personally love it. Plus the insane greatsword moveset is always great if it does feel a bit overpowered.Theres also the great scythe or the full moon sickle. These weapons will test you. They have one of the hardest move sets to get used to full moon sickle is the hardest to use. But you will feel great after mastering them. All Reapers have an inherent shield peirce when you hit with the blade of the weapon sweet spot. Youll probably want to keep around a faster closer range weapon if youre using these though.,DarkSouls2,ck9or31,2,t5_2vqni

1833692,0,t3_2fkpzv,Well I agree with you on the healing ones. But not on the curse ones. First of all Ive gone through the DLC twice. The first time I just wore the curses and kept going fighting the enemies until I got to the idol. Then I just popped an effigy afterwards.The second time and in typical Souls fashion I found a curse resist helmet that negates curse build up totally. So I strolled through both areas pretty easily.The strengthening buff one on enemies in the area is a pretty solid one and when I think about it the healing one isnt that annoying apart from the one with the big Minotaur when you insert the key and start the fires again.So overall I dont think they handled them badly at all. In fact by hiding the Curse Resist mask within the DLC and forcing people to find it means that the whole thing is executed quite well. As it punished me regularly for rushing the Idol instead of taking my time.,DarkSouls2,cka5kjo,5,t5_2vqni

1865977,0,t3_2fx2ds,Ive used Great Hammers for about  hours of my DS playtime and I will say that they are rather effective but you cant use them like smaller weapons.When I use my Demon Great Hammer or Sacred Chime Hammer I usually try to remain passive letting the opponent initiate the combat rollingbackstepping through their attack and then countering with one of my own. This works a lot of the time because people who use straight swords are used to winning a lot and most of them go ham as fuck when they see I have a fat weapon.The key is punishing mistakes. If I roll through a running attack and then my opponent swings again in the wrong direction I can land a rolling attack of my own which usually nets a second hit. And because Great Hammers do stupidly good damage per hit it only takes a couple of fuckups for them to go from full to dead. So dont discredit big weapons. I murder people with FotM weapons with my Dong Hammer constantly and I feel really good about doing it. Great Hammer is love Great Hammer is life.,DarkSouls2,cke1m6y,3,t5_2vqni

1876736,0,t3_2g2wfy,If you want to do a melee build grab weapons that do Strike damage. Clubs are viable from the start of the game until the end but youll want to diversify your arsenal so you arent forced to go back and repair your weapons all the time. I did mine in NG.One thing that was immensely helpful for me was to head to common CoOp areas Wharf and do Small Sign co op. This helps in a number of ways. It restores your health Estuses and repairs all of your equipment to full durability if not broken gives a chance at picking up healing items during coop and gives a Small Stone for trading nor healing with.Main problem with this is that its a long hike past Heides to do this.Make sure to stock up on homeward bones and to light the Majula bonfire when you first get there but dont sit!. Youll want to HB back whenever you feel that you are inadequately equipped for getting to a Great Soul Bonfire. Light the second Shaded Woods bonfire the crossroads one when you have the  souls as walking will be faster. Similarly light the first Castle Drangleic bonfire as youre about to finish the game so that you dont have to walk all the way back there.Some notable areas where I found it easy to dieright after Covetous. That bridge sucks BALLS.grabbing the Ember. This area alone is why I suggest a NG character. By doing NG you can skip Smelter while not having to deal with the two black phantoms in the furnace area and the other  new black phantom Alonnes. These guys tend to tear me a new asshole.Sentinels. You can avoid them by killing Pursuer and taking the back entrance in grabbing the key then  completing Wharf to access the locked door past the wood slats after the Heide Knight. You also need a Lockstone to progress on this path.Avoid Belfry Sol theres no reason to go there whatsoever. If you jump in the bonfire hole for some reason burn a couple healing items and fall from the hole up top to the ledge. Its a fairly easy jump.Dragonriders. summon some help its easy to get wombo comboed.Velstadt. This boss exemplifies the importance of ADP.WatcherDefender  fight them separately from Nash. Just because its real nice to have a summon for WD but AI summons for Nash are total shit they just sit next to her and die from curse and then you have to fight a tankier Nash by yourself.dont break the dragon eggs.Finally make sure to bring along a good bow. Youll need it. Also merchant hag sells unlimited healing items for cheap so that you can heal up between fights. Very useful.,DarkSouls2,ckfc8py,1,t5_2vqni

I dont even think I took too much damage mainly just chip damage from Ornsteins lightning based attack. After Ornstein was down I just let Smough get stuck on the pillars while I smacked him with Soul Arrows. It was ridiculously easy.For difficult fights I had major trouble with Sanctuary Guardian Kalameet and Artorias.Oh and Gwyndolin was just a pain in my ass because I always had to run to the library bonfire.Otherwise nothing was really an issue for me in the first game.Although I did have massive trouble with DS bosses on my first run.

They can interrupt just about everything too. Jumping attack? Free R combo. Sidestepping? H R hits to the side. Turtling? Shield pierce. Katana running attack? Outranged by H Rs. Rolling away? Running attack into an R combo. Theyre good in literally every situation except in a small corridor walls and ceilings are its weakness.

He keeps trying to poke me with the lance...when he suddenly used the R attack which caused him to run right off into the lava while bravely brandishing the Great Lance for glory.

1936954,0,t1_ckmkm3v,I disagree. Sony could have find a way to solve the issue given the Demon Soul have the same fidelity as Dark Souls and Dark Souls . Sony might not running into this issue with Demon Souls but that didnt automatically mean in hypotical situation they cant solve it.Ok what is the problem with Sony making their hardware hard to be emulated or cracked? Do you want people to crack and emulate PS so Sony and all the developers suffers from the sales lost due to this two act of thief? Developer will find it hard to make games on PS but in return their game will not be pirated. Theyll get the money they deserved. PS was uncracked for  years and during that time developers get all their cash.  Its a winning situation.Sony did exaggerate their console performance but Microsoft do the same too. Game developers too usually exaggerate their games graphical prowess. Like I say its a common occurance in game industry. Also Microsoft also do the console game demod on PC thing very recently in E  where they use a Window  operated PC. Quotegt Ks Evolve by Turtle Rock Studios was showcased at E exclusively with the PC version running on a pretty beefy Alienware system. Even in the Microsoft booth where the game was playable right alongside other Xbox One games running on actual hardware people were playing the game on a PC with an Xbox controller being led to believe the game looked that much better than anything else in that booth. Bare minimum acceptable for game is  fps? Dont make the rule by your own. The minimum is  fps because only below this we can see frame trasition in game aka lag using naked eye.If you try to argue fps look smoother and not giving anyone headache I can say  fps look even smoother and dipping into  fps give me headache. Pff.Consoles player play in  fps forever and they have no complain whatsoever. And they do know and notice when lags occur like the blightown so their eyesight isnt the problem.The minimum is  fps for the reason Ive stated.,DarkSouls2,ckmler7,1,t5_2vqni

1943922,0,t3_2gxf48,cheese him like i do every time.two hand a strong weapon use soul farm gear bc its light and he will one shot you anyway and throw a resin on your weapon. if you ever see him about to fly do a  and run like hell. other than that you want to bait his fire breath. you can do this every time when you get the position right. you want to run to the side of his face. make it so his front left foot and back right foot line up almost in a X or the other way aroundhe may still fly and you wonder why. you need to be a bit far from his face. so line his feet in an X and be about  feet from his head and you kinda want to be in line with where his neck and head meet. if he flys you are standing too close to his head or too far and you arent triggering his fire breath. once he sets up fire breath just run into his foot and exhaust your stamina with strong hits on it. one of the easiest fights in the game but it takes me a few tries every time i do it because i mess up the positioning. eventually i get enough bait attacks or i just dodge his fly breath enough that i win. the only time his flying breath should kill you is when he flys above you and shoots it down otherwise it is dodge able by running.i dont even do the fight anymore because i already have the weapon from the soul and you get ashen mist without fighting him. he gives a shit ton of souls so use soul farming gear and ring. if its your first play through though i would definitely do it. ps dont summon youll buff his health and the other guy will probably just screw up your cheese,DarkSouls2,cknfzyi,2,t5_2vqni

1954819,0,t1_ckoqf8f,Yes it does offer some defense to Raime but it is still heavier. Comparing sword weights and shield weight is like apples and oranges theyre totally different things. Take for one instance great and small shields vs. great and small swords. Small shields use a lot of stamina to block with since theyre too light to be very stable while greatshields require very little stamina to block with since their weight grants them stability. Meanwhile Small swords take very little stamina to swing since they are light and agile while ultra greatswords take a lot of stamina to swing because they are heavy and stable. Weight as a whole lends itself to defense but you need your most strength to use a heavy weapon. Using a sword to block is nothing new and Id much rather use my main hand weapon to block than use my weaker left hand. Further the UGS is clearly his main weapon since he uses it alone when he becomes enraged. using a heavy sword as a weapon requires as much strength as possible to move it as fast as possible while having a shield requires only enough strength to hold it steady between you and your opponent.The fact that he once had a shield and now uses a defensive weapon in his right hand is not evidence. Especially when youre trying to compare using a greatshield to using a greatsword.This one is simply a bone of contention between us. We have no idea what the relative strength needed to create and sustain these effects are but Id scoff at the notion that a few small bubbles are more of an influence than an entire tower of dark aura. The side chamber is much smaller and so the aura does not take as much influence so no its not the same. Her real body doesnt really do much besides be guarded by Raime and hold a crown thats not really evidence for stronger influence especially since we know she renounced her body. What we see down there is just a husk it doesnt even contain part of her soul.There is evidence but you do not recognize it. We know he was left handed and we know that he is the newest version of the Majestic Greatswords original master. Just because you disagree doesnt mean you can discount these facts.I understand that but there are ingame reasons to support the theory. I dont buy it myself but I understand that its plausible if unlikely.,DarkSouls2,ckorbxh,1,t5_2vqni

1983454,0,t3_2heuku,heres a rough translation of the whole thing. The statue which allows access to the unpublished area of this DLC will materialize in a room most of the ancients but in the middle of Winter Sanctuary along the road leading to the castle of Lordran. Once in the new area will be impossible not to be charmed by a glance the icy fortress of Elyum Loyce extends its walls to the eye breaking with this titanic gray snowy expanses that seem enormous. The snow storm that reduces your visibility the intricate icy fingers that wrap around the front door and then frost the silhouettes of the knights guarding the citadel convey a deep sense of desolation far more than it did the previous add online. Whilst we enter into Elyum Loyce we start to understand that the flavor of this DLC will again be different from that of the previous ones in fact the team returns to play with the architecture and with the level design trying to give the player not only glimpses of safe atmosphere but also some interesting variation with respect to the range of situations offerings from the main quest. Fortress Eluym Loyce for example seems huge and labyrinthine. There are from time to time the inland areas to be explored carefully rooms and corridors where they are hidden seedy magicians ice cream but a good part of the progression takes place in the open courtyards of the fortress full of side streets blind alleys crannies to explore. It is understandable then that From Software wanted to broadenand not to poco the boundaries of the setting of this DLC trying to push the player with more curiosity to explore the play area. too because he says TanimuraSan in this area are hiding some important NPC that will recruit they are the old guard of the King who once recruited to the cause of the player will help him in a grueling battle that takes place immediately before the encounter with the final boss. E at this juncture that we got stuck in the course of our Playtest after a couple of hours of play but unfortunately we did not recruit a sufficient number of allies and we were overwhelmed by the copious black guards that came the huge arena called great chaos. It would have been nice to be able to accomplish what the team described as a veritable pitched battle in which the little army set up by the player fight valiantly against the forces of evil. But on the other hand we have preferred well even to leave the element of surprise.That the playing area is larger than that of the previous DLC there is also confirmed by the presence of  bonfire as well as secret areas initially blocked by a thick layer of ice which will be opened after defeating the first boss titanic guard cat of the sovereign of which we do not want to tell you more. instead you say that the enemies scattered within the walls of Elyum Loyce are tough and bad although it is fairly easy to isolate and defeat them one by one. It is terrible spearmen armed shield mages who railed against the icy spears strange magical creatures materialize huge maces made of ice. As always the boss we will face will be  one of which is optional while in terms of objects we expect  not only new spells and miracles but also some weapons that unlock moveset very special and fun short to disrupt the conventions of Dark Souls  playing with animations like no other weapon has done so far.Crown of The Ivory King seems content can round off this successful trilogy of DLC that From Software has built for his Dark Souls  Hoping that this time the dynamics of all three bosses are unpublished and that there is no then the recycling since the previous expansion we can confirm that the atmosphere of the new zone are successful and convincing thanks also to a much wider level design and distracted. The promise of open area to explore and backtracking a well balanced along with the routine of the new enemies especially those fearsome magic leave us intrigued though today it is difficult to properly evaluate the difficulty level the character built for the occasion was far too powerful because the DLC could really put to the test. In any case we can not wait to know what will happen when we report the three crowns of the trilogy to its rightful owner well find out in a week if the chaos we allow it.,DarkSouls2,cks7gc1,3,t5_2vqni

1996928,0,t1_ckttufk,Now if at all that boss turned easy for you would tossing in a few casters to watch really add to the difficulty?This implies that this is what Dark Souls  does with its multiple enemy encounters and this just isnt true. A fight like Manus with adds would be fucking ridiculous because Manus is designed to be a v encounter. If the Throne Duo were as difficult as Raime or Artorias individually it would be goddamn impossible which is why they are designed to be two weaker pieces of a puzzle that fit together and become a balanced fight.Fights like say Freja or Elana are designed around multiple enemies at once. These bosses throw hazards at you that you must dodge while you either kite or kill off their adds. By themselves Freja or Elana dont really have much on Raime or Manus because they werent designed to be like that. Multiple enemy encounters is a great way to add difficulty to a fight as long as its done well and Dark Souls  does it just fine in most cases. A poor way to do it would be Royal Rat Authority or Capra Demon because they are fights that by all means SHOULD be vs but enemies are just carelessly plopped into the fight to be obnoxious instead Capra Demon and Rat Authority were NOT bosses that were designed around having a multiple enemy encounter.,DarkSouls2,ckttw25,2,t5_2vqni

2007698,0,t1_ckv2syw,I would agree that maybe while you are traveling through the SM tiers that some may be less populated than others especially if you stay in NG and continue to rack up souls.But the white sign allows you to reach across multiple tiers so it is possible to connect with a variety of people. However the skeleton king area is kinda meh. You wont find a lot of people hanging out there because there isnt much to do while waiting.Finding more active spots and going into ng are really the only way to sunbro consistently at a certain point. This is just my anecdotal experience from the . But my max SM character never lacks activity in coop wherever I go.The newest DLC area seems to be where a lot of people are congregating.

Compare it to a bandit knife numbers really are guesswork here does about ish no clue x    lower but much easier to stack up than with a whip so the end payoff is smaller but total damage would remain similar.Not that any of this makes any difference From decided to make bleed as it is know so we can only speculate ways it could have been.As for seeing the bleed meter you get plenty of signals they have been bled the initial movement speed knock is extremely noticeable D  ,DarkSouls2,ckvfs2u,1,t5_2vqni

2025736,0,t3_2hyyts,Some people have speculated that the improved quality of the DLC levels can be largely attributed to the more involved role that lead designer Naotoshi Zin played in the DLCs. The argument they say is that Zin was unable to really participate to the fullest in the base game even though he had the position of Lead Game Designer because he was also From Softwares president at the time.When the Lost Crown DLCs were announced From Software also announced that Hidetaka Miyazaki was replacing Zin as company president. This timing alongside the large gap in design quality between the base game and the DLCs has led people to believe that Zins increased participation was responsible for the massive jumps in DLC quality.Naotoshi Zin for those of you who dont know is basically the guy responsible for the Kings Field series of games and was also From Softwares founder.,DarkSouls2,ckxbbb6,120,t5_2vqni

2038193,0,t1_ckyv7u9,Another simple technique that is great and can be used with deadangling to great effect is baiting. Whiffing attacks on purpose to get the enemy in range often cancelling their attack animation unless they have monster poise and getting sweet counter damage on top of it. Its obvious to people who are used to UG weapons but I guess its worth mentioning since this seems to be a guide aimed at UG beginners.An awesome baiting combo for example would be the Zweis twohanded runningbackstep R into R Leo Ring for optimal results. The R flows seamlessly from the running R it actually feels like a momentum swing and most enemies will feel an urge to jump you when you purposefully whiff that uppercut just to get a rocket to the face. And if they wait out the thrust before commiting do a delayed R uppercut followup.UG weapons are just awesome. Being able to aim your swings midcombo even when locked on means that if you get creative you can hit enemies in all crazy sorts of ways.,DarkSouls2,ckywefv,2,t5_2vqni

I told him he was naive and just looking at the frontpage with default subs at any given minute would show most of the traffic is generated by procrastinating college kids or high school kids voting up video game posts cosplay posts scififantasy and all sorts of nerd culture as well as being more liberal minded but also more irresponsible and constantly broke so your typical college kid state of mind.

2066618,0,t3_2iibll,I agree with damn near everything you said but From adding any of this is very very unlikely. I dont think the games balance will ever make it far past how it is now. Maybe theyll nerf katanas and straight swords. There is something that bothers me though about rings. Just a personal preference. I really liked how in Dark Souls they gave you two slots with massive augmentations to your gameplay style. Wolf Ring turns a thief into a tank and due to the way poise works thats not really how the Ring of Giants works. Ring of Fog makes you damn near invisible to everything. My point is two rings in Dark Souls changed your gameplay more than four rings in DS. It made you think more about what to use and it rewarded you more for smart decisions. Look at a direct comparison between equivalent rings Leo Ring and Old Leo Ring. Leo Ring boosted Counter Damage by a massive  but Old Leo Ring boosts it by a pitiful . which is usually less than Ring of Blades flat increase. Again Red Tearstone boosted damage by  in DS now it boosts it by a useless . This makes these rings seem inconsequential and frankly boring compared to their predecessors and despite DS having terribly balanced rings Im almost entirely referring to RoFaP Dark Souls II added even more stupidly overpowered rings than even DS had by bringing back that ring plus adding the damage boosting rings plus breaking a mechanic that was already balanced in Dark Souls the Ring of Life Protection! So while the rings have a less interesting effect on the secondtosecond gameplay there are also fewer standout rings than there were which makes the rather boring and small selection of rings seem even smaller reducing the top rings to an amount that most players will simply be able to equip at once and never look at again. For PvE Ring of Life Protection Ring of Blades Third Dragon Ring Flynn or Chloranthy. For PvP Ring of Blades Third Dragon Ring Chloranthy and Stone Ring.To be clear Im not saying youre wrong to choose rings other than those but theyre pretty clearly much better than most other rings and that poor balance disappoints me.,DarkSouls2,cl2ih2i,13,t5_2vqni

The pitch black blade binds to its owners soul for to offer great power at a cost.The swords last owner altered this weapon to be hiltless symbolizing his ignorance toward defending himself. Though this weapon is said to cut through any material it has somehow found itself without an owner. Deals pure physical damage scales with STR and DEX quality build. The twohanded parry is replaced with a weapon buff that envelopes the sword in an eerie blue light. While active the physical damage this weapon causes is increased greatly. Additional the buff consumes a portion of your souls each passing second.  You cannot wield this weapon with  souls as it will break automatically. Be cautious of dying while this weapon is equipped.,DarkSouls2,cl2n5mg,3,t5_2vqni

And if every single area youre going to is light then you obviously need to tone the brightness down a bit.

2095599,0,t1_cl66sah,I feel like the R is the only truly useful thing about this rapier. Ive been messing with it Ive gotten  in PvE and its absolutely godawful even with buffs using the ordinary Rs. Its got terrible durability which I think counteracts the overuse of the R. Granted repair powder and BKR can keep it going but it appears to be viable only in PVP as a backup.Its only real use in PVP for myself at least is punishing great healestus chugging. I havent been hit once with it in the arena today. When Ive tried to use it in lieu of the chaos rapier Or that sweet Espada Ive found it subpar in R usage. Its counters are OK but the other rapiers outpace it by a country mile in every other way. Also for  million SM its nearly useless. The damn thing breaks so fast that I went through  on a rank  havelmonster before switching back to dual Greatswords and finishing him off with that instead.

2102597,0,t1_cl72u7r,Oooh I forgot about Sif that one is pretty evil for the Chosen Undead.  Nito is the God of death and literally administers disease to all living things.  While maybe there is a necessity to death at some point I cannot fathom a world in which Nito is good guy and I dont really think of him as neutral either.  The Four Kings are evil even if they were corrupted.  Thats like saying Hitler wasnt evil because something corrupted him it doesnt matter what matters is the decisions of the moral actor.  They helped create the darkwraith and plunge the once promising New Londo into ruins.As for Quelaag the Chosen Undead does not choose to fight Quelaag she chooses to fight him.  He is just passing by I have never stated that Quelaag was evilI dont think this is true but killing someone in self defense is a lot different morally speaking than killing them for their soul like Maiden Astrae in Demon Souls.,DarkSouls2,cl733h1,1,t5_2vqni

I could of challenged myself a bit more but me and my friend were racing to rank  so i got it as quickly as possible lol. Btw i still dont believe i have ran into you anywhere my live ran out the other day tho so maybe one day DBut yeah they do seem like a way for you to git gud. During the days i played with ugs class weapons i usually mained the kings ugs. In some fights it seemed amazing i could nearly  shot people. On the other hand if i got beat it would usually be pretty badly. Playing so much with that weapon really helped me with spacing and timing also it made me more patient instead of going fullforce aggro. But tbh it felt more like the people i would destroy with it were just not very good players. Anyone with decent agility and half a brain could dodge out of any of the attacks. Even if they attacked missed and i go for a counterattack they still can reaction dodge.Maybe im lookin at it the wrong way but from a more technical standpoint these weapons just dont seem to be for pvp. Especially when you have oldleo buffed rapiers and katanas outdamaging you. Once you add in phantom range of the pokes with that leo damage  iframes when people roll through your attacks you lose every single advantage the ultra weapon has goin for it damage range wide arcs etc.,DarkSouls2,clbs945,1,t5_2vqni

Handle is made of sharpened bones and seems only to only respond to those who have returned from death.Moveset would be similiar to a Zweihander except faster.

Two Handing and pressing R while hollowing slams the handle into the ground and a black circle filled with black fire that catapults towards nearby enemies would surround the player. It can golf swing higher than the Zweihander could originally.Deaths Ritual Sword A sword born of the original bones of the Dead One. The blade carved out of bones craves death even the death of its user.This would have the moveset of a long sword but with less reach slightly faster.

All that matters is your equipment burden  as long as thats under  youre good.Shields will work against the Old Knights yeah. The old knights do physical damage with their attacks and the Silver Kite Shield blocks iirc of physical damage. If you look at the stats for the shield you can see exactly how much physical magic fire lightning and dark damage are blocked by the shield. Upgrading your shield will increase its stability  a shield with high stability uses less stamina to block attacks. Oh and you mentioned that youre wearing the Old Knight armor set. I think its generally a good armor set. Its not very durable but your equipment is fixed everytime you rest at a bonfire so that shouldnt be too much of an issue. ,DarkSouls2,clgca6t,1,t5_2vqni

2209389,0,t3_2kew72,I find the parallel between the low visibility of the Frigid Outskirts and other dark areas of the game like the Gutter for instance or Tomb of Giants in DS very interesting. It would be even more of a solid comparison had the original dynamic lighting engine been intact.Imagine if the Frigid Outskirts colors were inverted youre wandering around in a sprawling mostly pitch black level you have a kirin appear at the edge of the visibly lit sphere youre in it charges you roll around in the dark etc. Occasionally some light source goes by above you illuminating the place before casting it into darkness again. Think The Abyss but the size of the Outskirts and like the Outskirts it leads to some big bad boss.Im sure people would still have extreme opinions for and against this level and itd definitely be easier on the eyes although the lava moat in Lost Izalith still holds the record for most eyewrecking level but I wonder if the hate would be as huge. I think probably not since a dark level in Dark Souls seems thematically tied and just being in the dark is a different kind of fearfrustration then dealing with a chilly blizzard.I dunno. Like anything that gets extreme reactions the area is neither as great nor as awful as peoples opinions make them out to be. The level itself and the kirin spawns require patience diligence and understanding just like any other area or boss in the game that poses a specific challenge. Once the player discovers everything the area is going to throw at them then obvious methods of survival and progression begin to present themselves to the player.,DarkSouls2,clko15p,6,t5_2vqni

Love the H rolling attacks course Im also having tons of fun using greataxes and those have a very similar if not identical h rolling attack I pulled a clutch kill by turning around and sprinting for half a second rolling delaying the button press while also inputting the opposite direction and then finally attacking for the kill.  Made me so happy cause I often times practice doing  rolling attacks but seldom get the chance to use them.  Its damage is also really good and just enough length to pseudocombo Rs after two Rs hitting them mid roll afterwardsPrior to that I used the Possessed Armor Sword.  Being a straight sword it can punish those sillies who roll when you get too closestay too close but arent attacking and its Rs do very pretty damage. Its one handed R can be used to bait people won quite a few cause of it.

Id say join the Dragonbros and throw your sign down on the IK bridge or Heides and just keep going at it until you can PVP well. Everyone has their own style and preferences so none of us can really tell you how to play or what to play with. You will die a lot in the beginning especially now when a lot of people have been PVPing for a while and have their equipment set up just the way they like whilst youre just starting off. However dont let that discourage you. Everyone starts PVP by getting the shit kicked out of them and eventually they learn how to deal with it. One general piece of advice though would be to start with fast weapons and work up to heavy weapons since they are harder to win with. Other than that you can check out this video if you havent already to get some starting tips. This dude really knows what hes doing so it should provide some kind of guidance.Besides that good luck and have fun.

2327652,0,t1_clzb676,I was under the impression Pharris was male since his bow refers to him as he. It does drop off of a female forest hunter so who knows.If were gonna go that deep into wild speculation we may as well say that Gwyndolin is Velka in disguise because hisherits followers hunt the sinners in the book of the guilty.Also if she was opposing the chosen undead why did the crow often thought to be hera follower of her bring us to Lorderan in the first place? I think we can safely say Velka is on the side of the Chosen undead. I get the impression that she is more opposed to Gwyn rather than wanting an age of dark or light. Maybe because he is not a true god but claims to be a god or maybe for the sin of genociding the dragons who we honestly never see as a threat more a matter of them being in the way.Also the orb is near the murder victim I wouldnt say its location is influenced by Oswald tbh,DarkSouls2,clzesq4,1,t5_2vqni

And two of the three have two bluemoon Longswords. Since my SWORDSMAN of all characters could not get into a new playthru in time he only has one. So I made three NG characters that I spedran thru FotFG to Cale got the Mansion key and sat them outside the chests for any new promotions. At some point when its clear there will be no more reskinned weapons i will get the help of a friend to consolidate these reskinned weapons onto a NG character I want to play through the game as get the character to NG and have my friend again help me move these reskins to other characters including getting my swordsman a second bluemoon longsword.So I do technically have two extras but theyre kind of tied up in NG currently.

2351783,0,t3_2maajf,Another idea which works for most NPC phantoms and invaders if you are using a strength build i know you said you were using a dex just throwing it out here is an UGS. Wait for them to saunter on up somewhat close and unload on them it stunlocks them and they almost never immediately follow up with an attack so you can deplete your stamina if you wish. Then just simply back away and let your stamina refill and repeat. It just takes a bit of timing to learn when to throw the first attack but it generally works for just about every single one. From Nameless Usurper to the NG phantoms. About the only one thats tricky is the phantom just outside the Executioner Chariot since he has an UGS moveset and has high aggro.Cheap as all hell sure.

2362247,0,t1_cm3njap,The reason why people dont like bowfinishers is because its a cheap way to avoid a trade. Its essentially the same as magic. We dont hate magic because damage. We hate it because of its range. Range in general is not preferred in PVP. I thought you of all people would know this.Mainly because bows do random amounts of damage they are untelegraphable and hard to dodge they are just about as cheap as magic. If not more than. Magic is usually slow enough for you to dodge. And in PVP latency makes it damnednear impossible for you to perfectly dodge fast dark arrow after dark arrow. Also it just feels pretty pathetic if someone with a pretty solid victory record loses because someone kept backpedalling and hurling arrows at him. Not everyone uses a shield. If you still dont get it look at it this way Magic is like a Ranged UGS. Truckdamage but not entirely difficult to dodge. Arrows are like Ranged Rapiers or Straightswords.

We definitely know that Havel was a man one of Gwyns most devout followers and a very powerful cleric but an untold amount of time passed between DS and DS. A kingdom called Havel could have sprung up during this time one devout to the legend of Havel the Rock one who copied designs of his armor and upon its destruction was forgotten and a small surviving bit of it ended up in a place where all things are discarded and forgotten The Gutter.

If he was a max level character or rather a  dex character even with a resinsacred oath then its a level difference problem rather then a true balance problem.I think that is one of the reasons why the chaos blade is considered so bad honestly. Its a weapon that profits a lot from having a level advantage over foes and can absolutely crush others if that is the case. However if the levels are equal and the SL isnt SL  it really isnt all that absurd.Besides it loses a lot of trading power due to the fact that it has the  health on a miss. A good player can easily backstep a chaos blade user to death. Every hit has to be aimed to kill because other wise the user will end up dead himself.,DarkSouls2,cm7smyr,0,t5_2vqni

2400084,0,t1_cm8asam,I went out of my way to say my point wasnt that Dark Souls had no backstab problem. Why you think I said the opposite is beyond me. Again my point is that bs fishing is just as much a source of problems and debate in DS as in the first game. The problems associated with them are different in either game mind you. In DS it may have been too easy to get a backstab and it DS there are too few ways to deal high damage due to the balance leaning more towards heavy armors without the loss of mobility thus encouraging backstabbing. Not for nothing but evidently you are arguing with someone else since I havent said any of the things you are talking about.,DarkSouls2,cm8cx2w,1,t5_2vqni

You realize Syan was not a Mastadon right?  Do you understand how flimsy that connection sounds?Watch thisAlthough we dont know the Looking Glass Knights identity for certain its incredibly likely that it is Lord Aldia himself.  We already know that Aldia had a hand in Vendricks rule and due to his disappearance the LGK is a likely idea for being Aldia currently.  This is only supported by the fact that Aldia has the very same mirrors used by the LGK in his mansion suggesting that he perfected the process and used it as a weapon as the LGKPretty good right?  At least as good as yours.Theres also the fact that the LGK served Vendrick many years before the war with the Giants.  Whom do you think was there to test the mettle of warriors such as the Syan Guard and Dragonriders before Syan died?  You can easily write it off as Oh well the LGK didnt do it back then duh!! but you have no evidence supporting that while I have explicit evidence stating he tested knights for King Vendrick.

2437237,0,t1_cmcve9u, They dont give you an upgrade option. The most avid fans of the series already own the game and the dlcs wich means they basically have to rebuy everything to get the complete dark souls . Wich makes no sense at all other than make people pay twice. They falsely advertised the game graphics prior to the release now they are selling better graphics than what we finally got but only with a full rebuy. They split the PC Community into half at best. This means less Coop less PvP and less chance to play with your friends because they might have the other version of the game. While they give some content out for free to the old owners they leave content away that seems kinda important especially to hardcore fans Graphic and performance upgrade !!! improved online multiplayer !!! Enemy and gamedesign adjustments !!! The free content is and feels more like a bait to get people back into playing DS to than sell them the new version They act like DX is something new that came at the same time as Xbone and PS. For the old generations its understandable why they wont get the above mentioned features hardware limitations but DX is  years old and hardware limitation was never a problem of PCs especially not on DS. Also dont forget DS isnt even a year old. People who already bought the game prior to the SotFS edition basically funded the further development of the game. Now they are the ones who either miss out on some core features or buy the whole thing again at full price.Read those reasons and keep in mind that hardcore fans want everything of the Dark Souls franchise and they want a complete game with every feature possible. Even though they already payed between  Bandai Namco want to charge them again. That just sucks. I personally wont bother DS anymore if they really pull this off.Why is this problem only on PC? For the current Gen consoles there wasnt a darksouls prior to this edition and for last gen consoles there wont be a superior version than the one already available.Edit What could be a solution? Give the people who already own the Game and the DLCs a reasonable discount for the SotFSEdition so they dont feel like they pay twice for the same content. Or give the people who already own the GameDLCs a option for a reasonable price to upgrade their version of the game.Edit Another point It appears that there are people who bought the season pass under the impression to get all the future updates for the game like season passes usually do at other games e.g. CoD. In my opinion it was made clear what the season pass offers but I can comprehend why people might thinkfeel this way.,DarkSouls2,cmcy590,88,t5_2vqni

2437827,0,t1_cmcz6vn,Id say that the Pigmy and the Dark Soul are a punishment for extracting the Lord Souls from the First Flame.

In the big picture this is the fading of the flame in the case of the queens it is the fall of their kingdoms.And if the Pigmy is a consequence for comitting the First Sin what would be the Scholar? I really doubt From would just come up with a fancy subtitle like that. I personally liked DS not because of its grandiosity but the humanity in it. Kings their queens and loyal friends always seems to represent basic human feelings. There is more recently the Ivory King that was an altruist and Alsanna who is just afraid of everything which is why she doesnt let you close to her. This led to his demise as we could see. So it seems to me that DS isnt about those persons or what theyve created but about the underlying mechanisms that seems to make history repeat itself in this world.,DarkSouls2,cmd0rkq,1,t5_2vqni

If it helps the flow of the game and isnt modding then whats the problem? Look at Smash Bros Melee tournaments for example. Wavedashing is a very essential technique to learn in high competitive play but its an exploit in the same sense deadangling is.

Feels cheap . Forbidden Sun just murders anything flame swathe is epic for diversion Flame swathe gt forbidden sun .

2520487,0,t3_2oijob,According to wikipediagtDark Souls II presents its plot in an unconventional way that makes it difficult to understand in one playthrough and it has several unclear or unknown elements. In this way the game encourages its community to share and review findings and interpretations with each other in order to fully understand it.gtThe story revolves around a male or female Undead human known as the bearer of the curse who has nearly lost their mind and gone hollow in their search for a cure. They have traveled to Drangleic which is rumored to be home to powerful souls that can help Undead regain their humanity and avoid this fate. The bearer of the curse finds their way to Majula a settlement in Drangleic where they meet an enigmatic woman known as the Emerald Herald who acts as the players guide. She asks the player to seek four ancient beings with immense souls and Vendrick the king of Drangleic.gtAfter claiming these four great souls or a certain number of regular souls which changes depending on the playthrough the protagonist gains access to Drangleic Castle and can meet Nashandra the queen of Drangleic. Nashandra urges the protagonist to visit King Vendrick who has abandoned his own castle. When the protagonist reaches Vendrick inside the Undead Crypt it is revealed that the former monarch of Drangleic has actually gone completely hollow mindlessly wandering around in circles.gtIn order to proceed the bearer of the curse must travel through Aldias Keep and visit the colossal Ancient Dragon in the Dragon Shrine. If the dragon isnt provoked it will speak with the player and willingly give the player an Ashen Mist Heart. The player can alternatively attempt to take the item by force and kill the Ancient Dragon. After having met the dragon Queen Nashandra may offer guidance to the bearer of the curse by instructing him or her to seek the Forest of the Fallen Giants. She will also claim the Ancient Dragon is a false deity.gtWith the Ashen Mist Heart the player can travel through time into the memories of withered creatures. In the Forest of the Fallen Giants the bearer of the curse may interact with several longdead withered Giants  a race from the northern continents whose homeland was attacked by Vendrick at Nashandras request. Inside the memories of the Giant found beyond the door that Vendricks ring opens the player must fight and defeat the leader of the Giants. After achieving victory the player gains a mysterious item called the Giants Kinship and can finally reach the throne below Drangleic Castle.gtAs their final objective the bearer of the curse must open the door to the Throne of Want and become the next monarch. After opening the sealed door the Emerald Herald warns the bearer of the curse that Nashandra will come after him or her in order to prevent him or her from linking the fire the act of offering oneself up as fuel for the First Flame of the world. Linking the fire temporarily cures the Undead curse and hinders the spreading of the Abyss which is a pitchblack darkness that threatens to corrupt and swallow the entire world.gtInside the Throne of Want after the Throne Watcher and Defender are defeated Nashandra herself will appear as the final boss of the game. Afterwards the Giants Kinship will activate several golems who form a path through the Abyss. The player sits down upon the throne and becomes the next monarch. The Emerald Herald narrates that only the sovereign monarch can see what lies ahead the protagonist is transported back to Majula and may choose to start the journey again via the bonfire.gtUpon further inspection of Nashandras soul her identity is revealed to be a fragment of Manus the Father of the Abyss who was the final boss and main antagonist of the Artorias of the Abyss expansion for the original Dark Souls. She had manipulated Vendrick in order to spread the Dark and extinguish the Flame. This might suggest that in the first game the Chosen Undead chose to rekindle the First Flame as Lordrans flame was the first flame which started the cycle.I was too lazy to actually write something.,DarkSouls2,cmnkdo8,3,t5_2vqni

More special effects for armors to give people a reason to use them other than fashion. Examples Shadow Set slightly increases ADP andor DEX Vengarls Set increases STR Black Hollow Mage set increases spell damage while White Hollow Mage set increases cast speed White PriestPriestess set should increase Miracle power Leydia Black and White sets should give bonuses too. Dunno maybe Im just salty that there are many awesome armors for mages yet only the uglyashell Lion Mage set has bonuses. More rings with unique effects! A ring that replaces your rolls with dashes or sidesteps cosmetic only no bonuses at all a ring that increases STR or DEX but reduces another stat maybe VIT or END. Balance changes. IFrames should be affected by equip load higher   less iframes increase elemental resists of Havels set but reduce physical defense I dont care about poisemonsters or havelgyrmjesters I just want Havels Armor to become the fuck magic armor again  maybe change how poise works but not like it was in DkS  it was OP as fuck there maybe give poise a secondary Stagger Recovery effect or something I dunno. A FUCKIN PDB AND TWINKLING TITANITE VENDOR! More spells. A pyromancy that creates a ring of fire around you a hex that releases several Dark Orbs in a circle then they come back to you kinda like one of Manus attacks a sorcery that covers your body in crystals similar to Iron Flesh that gives you a massive resistance to physical and magic damage but makes you slow as fuck maybe balance it to make it almost impossible to remove this penalty and when the duration ends it explodes dealing damage to everyone around you.

2589677,0,t3_2pg3n2,There will probably be a Dark Souls . Im both hopeful and would be glad if it did come out. But Im fairly certain it will be. For one even with the addition of new content with the new version the Dark Souls series is far from being closed in terms of lore. I think FROMs intentions is that we will eventually discover the nature of the curse. From a business perspective Dark Souls  did amazingly well in the market and NAMCO will want to capitalize on that. Dark souls is a powerful brand on its own even to people who havent played and it would be a waste not to do another one. Miyazaki will probably only be involved in a superficial role just as he was in DS although his presence is important to keep the same ideologies and themes throughout as he is the inventor of the series. ,DarkSouls2,cmwlvxy,1,t5_2vqni

OF COURSE a ton of lowlevel invaders would have lategame equipment that was the only way a lowlevel character would even get to invade.Funnily enough even if they did away with Soul Memory now twinking wouldnt be nearly as much of a problem as it was in DS because the BoB is easy to get to from Majula. Some people would still twink because some people are just assholes but the ratio of appropriately balanced characters to twinks would be acceptable.I find it ironic that this games most criticized flaw wasnt even a necessary feature.

As the downside you lose a ton of health making you extremely fragile. As the upside you gain more spellcasts making running out of casts less likely. The  version is given by Carhillion if you have  Int. The  one can be found later on in Aldias.Unfortunately the health cost is so steep for the casts it gives that it should probably not be used in for example PvP. However it does give the playthrough way more character With  of your health gone no points in Vig and light armor you truly become the classic fragile caster who has a vast arsenal of spells but dies at the slightest mistake. ,DarkSouls2,cn1akqb,1,t5_2vqni

Bear in mind the large hole above the acidic pool adjacent to the room you are talking about.  If you study that hole from above you will notice that it is the perfect size to act as a toilet for the Giants who were once kept at Aldia manner.  Furthermore we know from the interactions with the insect creatures and their egg clusters in the sanctum walkway and the egg sacs at the bottom of the gutter that Acid is organic in nature  seemingly an organically excreted byproduct of some natural physiological process.  So we have excreted organic matter pooled in a pit below a hole in the ground...sounds an awful lot like a septic tank to me.  If there are any doubts recognize that there are two dogs famous connoisseurs of fecal matter frolicking in the foetid refuse.  Being that the Giants were a subject of study for Lord Aldia does it not make sense that all aspects of their being would be studied by his men up to and including their digestive processes?  And does it not further make sense that the laboratory connected to the manors septic tank would contain samples of the Fecal Matter of Giants?So yes  its shit.,DarkSouls2,cn38vz4,10,t5_2vqni

2703344,0,t3_2r0rx3,If they make a soulsstyle fighting game... Mechanics I would want to see is Character Creation. The last few Soul Calibur games all had this and allowed you to pick a default fighters moveset.. What if they expanded on that and had a few different weapons you could choose from that changed your character?Slower more purposeful than Soul calibur Soul Calibur is arguably slower paced than say street fighter or tekken or other games of its nature.. however Souls Calibur should be a little slower to emulate the combat of dark souls  let a few hits kill but make it so people that are good can dodgeblockparry. That way its not just endless hits on a larger HP pool.No Supers I love super moves in most games if its done fairly. However the last thing I would want to see in Souls Calibur would be the addition of it. To me Dark Souls has always been about the skill of your own two hands. The ability to kill your opponent with a few well placed moves.. I wouldnt want to see some sort of meter to let you be able to go crazy all of a sudden..CharactersLets get the obvious out of the way Artorias Solaire PatePatches.Interesting characters Id love to see some of the enmies make an appearance.. anything thats plausible. The snake guys from sens fortress that I forget the name of royal soldiers from  syan Knights... and Id love to be able to finally use Agdaynes hexes.But if the character creation engine is good.. then why couldnt they just use that to give us nearly every character in the souls series?

2713774,0,t3_2r4yrp,Its important to remember that in most cases you will have to press the parry button before your opponents attack even starts.  The precise timing depends on latency and your parrying tool and there are several tactics people use that require some prediction.  Look up parry guides on Youtube. I recommend Juutas and PvPSkillz.  Your success will also depend on the skill of your opponent. A lot of people will mix up their attack timings and punish any attempted parries.  You will not be able to parry every opponent consistently.    There are also some attacks that cant be parried.  Almost all jumping attacks some twohanded great weapon attacks and all whip attacks will ignore your parry.    It will require a lot of practice but its definitely doable.  Just dont depend on parries too much.  Too many players just equip an ultra greatsword and a buckler and throw out parries in between attacks hoping for a oneshot riposte.  Parrying should be one of several PvP tactics you use.,DarkSouls2,cncjn74,2,t5_2vqni

2774054,0,t3_2rtoyt,Its very cheap and a sour way to end a fight. Bows are pretty dumb in general the lack of stamina drain while keeping one drawn is stupid. I only use shields for parries so when Im carrying my small leather shield and someone whips out a lightning hunters bow... Well thats your fault for not carrying a heavier shield  by that logic I should always be wearing Havels with backstab protection and buffed twinblades and ice rapiers since I dont tank as much nor do as much damage as  of my opponents.And yes I regard bow cheesing as highly unskilled play.

If you can consistently parry the RIT then more power to you but my qualm with having it as the first answer is that compared to a lot of other tactics it relies pretty heavily on the connection with your opponent. That said countering it is pretty straightforward at this point. Its a solid tactic but only once youve gotten a good read on the opponent  their behavior as well as their latency so the best course is to save the parry as you said.,DarkSouls2,cnl6wzk,1,t5_2vqni

Architecturally I always felt there was a similarity between the two so it might be possible that they were somehow tied or maybe just constructed at the same time. Im however more inclined to believe Vendrick built Drangleic castle to share its appearance with Dragon Shrine which he found together with Aldia hence the elevator at the end of Aldias keep carved inside the columnmountain. Judging solely by its inhabitants and shape Id dare guess the origin of the Shrine is the same as Heide  the guardians in the Shrine and the ones in Heide look very similar both in armor and weaponry.It is also however very possible that Aldia simply pushed away piece of Drangleic Castle and made it into the Shrine.

Even though there should be a large amount of space between some of the areas it usually only takes a short walk or elevator ride to get anywhere. It works the same way with armor and weapons. Even though they should be way too big for the player they end up being just the right size because sizespace is really wish washy in the souls universe. It can easily change depending on the situation. Thats my theory for the lore. The obvious reason is because the devs want us to be able to use the armor and weapons.,DarkSouls2,cnrz1sr,1,t5_2vqni

2851364,0,t1_cns71ad, Dex I corrected that.  Dex would only take you to SL . All those weapons are useable.  VIT  TDR is signficantly more armor than Flynn users and if thats not enough then go with Ring of Giants or Ring of Soldiers instead of Ring of Faith. Why do you need casting speed for Heavenly Thunder or Blinding Bolt? Dont tell me were going to try to sling Sunlight Spears here.I see the mismatch is your interpretation of hybrid. The build I suggested can easily match or exceed the damage of pure physical Flynns ring builds through the combination of Sunlight Blade  infused weapon. Pure physical builds may have more stamina or slightly more health but you have MUCH higher magic defense with GMB and can do half their health in damage with Blinding Bolt or Heavenly Thunder while matching them for melee damage output. There are some things this build will do better and some things other builds will do better. With some creativity all are viable. This obsession with having perfect stats or what you may consider a complete or flawless build is a notion that no longer stands in capped gameplay.Honestly not trying to be rude but were you around for game launch? Hybrids have never been weak in this game. Flynn ring and patches have simply brought physical weapons up to speed.EDIT And so you know I think a SL  metagame would be more balanced than SL .

2885694,0,t3_2t5na6,I think the biggest factor to having a good fight club run is to get some momentum going in your first  fights. Once you get in the zone the next thing to consider is that your next opponent is watching you fight. So not only to you have to adapt to each opponent but if you rely on a gimmick the next man up will see what you are doing and have a game plan before the fight even starts. The other x factor is intimidation. If you step up and just destroy someone the next man up will likely be wary.    tldr  get momentum going always adapt keep intimidation factor high    edit Also on most of my pvp builds I carry a wide variety of weapons and will frequently switch weapons before fights. This will throw off people that have just watched you fight and also is a part of always adapting. If the next man up is using a thrust sword it might be a good idea to use a weapon that can out range them. If the next man up has a buckler maybe you should use a whip as a nd weapon for some mixup game. The worst thing you can do is use the same strat for every fight gimmicks. Good players will see through a gimmick and exploit it.,DarkSouls2,cnw3trp,1,t5_2vqni

The Iron Giants are fairly slow and predictable which would make them very easy to kill if not for the neat little detail that they have lava spewing out of their shoulders in a alternating fashion. This forces you to think about to which side you can safely roll and punishes you if you make the wrong choice.Dark Souls isnt really about you being able to facetank shit. It was viable in DkS due to how poise worked but once you entered NG that wasnt a really good way to play anymore. In Dark Souls  its significantly harder because Armor matters less and poise wont always stop you from being staggered.If you want to tank lots of stuff get a greatshield and use that.

This is annoying but easily avoidable unless you get blocked in a corner somehow and even then Repair Powder is a thing everyone should have on them just in case. Good with me since its a hassle to get them posioned. There should be a counter to poison so its fine. Besides a competent player will expect someone to use it and will have a plan to deal with it. Jesters is annoying but I dont care about the other two. I have a SL so I dont care. I never use buffs so it doesnt affect me. I can see why it irritates people but tough shit for them I guess. Its funny to watch them apply  different buffs and then finally get to it. I dont really care what they use. Its all good in invasions but I think it would be a bit of a dick move in a summoned duel.Basically I dont care what you use but Ill judge the shit out of your playstyle and fashion though that is subjective.

I lit the fire and scholar appeared...It doesnt appear when you kill the last Lord common misconception scholar appears when you light the last primal bonfire. Go back check all of the primal bonfires if they are all lit then check agape ring. If you arent on patch get patched and go to rotten and he will appear.Good luck.

3073485,0,t1_cogjo4e,Here are some adjustments I made which could help out. Reduced INTFTH to  instead of . Spice down whatever hexes you want to meet your stats and this gives you  extra points to mess around with. You could even take it lower if you wanted more points. You had hardly any agility so I increased it to  by increasing ADP. This will make dodging easier but if you dont needwant it throw it into VIGEND. Increased your VIG a bit.  Gave you the bare stats for the Fume Sword. Id recommend using this as its a fast weapon light weight and scales well with dark. Im not great with infusions so I dont know if infusing it with dark is the best option but you can test that out and see what your AR is like. Id say its your best option. I kept the same rings but Id recommend using something else besides the Clear Bluestone Ring. There are others that are more useful and you dont need nearly  casting speed. Get Chloranthy instead or something. Same with Ash Knuckle Ring. Not worth it. Better off going with something else. Besides the Fume Sword you could try out the Chaos Rapier or the Possessed Armour Sword infused with fire. Both are good fast weapons. Silverblack Spear is also a good one to use. Whatever you go with remember to adjust your stats to try and keep below  weight for increase rolling distance and faster stamina regen. ,DarkSouls2,cogkc4c,1,t5_2vqni

Ha ha.I was dueling on the bridge with my SL and ran into a host and a Sunbro both using Welcome and I Wont Bite and Im used to ganks so I popped one of my precious resins Agape Ring build naturally and charged. Hit the host he rolls away summon shrugs host heals. Nobody attacks.Another red is summoned in and the host and phantom gesture to get a v going. I take my place in the bridge thinking itll be a fun time and the other red charges the host and backstabs him with a dagger. The phantom and host chase the phantom through the keep and after a minute hes gone. They return heal up and summon another red. v starts my handy dandy Murakumo and Cursed Bone Shield ready. I switched out my Ring of the Embedded for the TDR and we went to work.Sunbro comes at me with a straight sword but he wasnt hard to take down. Got a super parry on him after the two handed R combo followed by the R so he was pretty much rekt. The host kills the other red at the exact same time as I take out the phantom then walks to me and gestures Joy. We bow to one another worthy opponents and the final fight starts.The host was really good at what he did. He was using what seemed to be a HexSTR build with a Dark infused buffed Club and a second uninfused Club and the Drangleic Shield in the other hand. His Club game was tops and I was already down a bit of health from the other phantom. He wasnt at full health either and we were fairly well matched. We both get to low health and I swap out my Ring of Blades for the RTSR hoping to get that last swing to count.He charges at me for a rolling attack and gets parried which he wasnt expecting. Instead of riposting I use the Murakumos HR but it doesnt kill him thanks RTSR and I didnt follow up because he could punish it due to t not being a two hit combo. He rolls away and tosses a throwing knife meant to bait me into a parry but I roll cancelled my rolling attack and switched to my Thief Dagger in my second slot. He rolls just in time to evade me then comes back with a rolling attack which I miss the parry on putting me at the magic pixel of health.Were both one hit from death.He pulls out a parrying dagger.I pull out a parrying dagger.He parries missing.I go in for an attack.He attacks with the parrying dagger to kill me before my ATTACK finishes. Didnt see it coming at all. Sent him a GG and told him that he was a great player and an asshole for killing me. We laughed. It was fun.  would do again Knight Armor host man.

It wouldnt break below  FPS but it would increase the durability damage per frame which I guess would be kinda fair.Regardless I dont think that FPS can be used so easily in an equation since it varies over time. You cant check for FPS in a single frame youd have to set when to start checking and when to stop checking then make an average.Or you constantly check for FPS and check the value when the players weapon goes through a hitbox but that can lead to weird behavior if the FPS varies too much ex at  FPS for a while and then hit something at a peak of  FPS which would have the weapon in a hitbox for twice as many frame but calculating with the full durability damage.,DarkSouls2,cpcq065,1,t5_2vqni

So many parts of the game are memorable especially those moments that were completely unexpected.

Its one of the reasons why it is still my favorite from all three every boss fight feel so different and memorable. Phalanx being protected by so many minions and having such a unique design. The allintimidating Tower Knight the struggle with those archers on the walls and the satisfaction of bringing that thing down to the floor. Watching Biorr vs The Penetrator and realizing that guy could take that beast all by himself. The False King along with the Flamelurker and Old Monk were the only ones in Demons that were straights oneonone no shenanigans fights and god was he strong. The struggle to even get to the Armor Spider while she shoots fire and web to the tunnel. Flamelurker was so strong and intense that it made me play standing and talking to myself. The Dragon God being something you clearly couldnt defeat conventionally. The Fools Idol and the deceiving fight which could be made impossible if you didnt took the right precoutions. The Maneaters and the horror of seeing a second boss health bar. And the Old Monk... I think the video illustrated well what that meant. The weak spot of the otherwise invulnerable Adjudicator. The blind Old Hero and the tension of not letting him notice you. And god that beast of the Storm King only the vision of him made me shiver... and then ripping the sky with the Storm Ruler to damage that thing was... awesome. That horrendous Leechmonger and his parasitic attacks. The battle of attrition with the Dirty Colossus and his overwhelming resilience from that armor. Astraea and Garl Vinland was undoubtedly the most welldesigned and unique boss fight from the series and made you really feel something.

3530383,0,t3_30pnku,Some advice I can give youFirstly are you part of the champions covenant? If so leave it as it makes everything harder. In regards to the actual boss unless you are ranged stay by his legs and remember that you dont have to lock on.  If you back up too much he uses his sweeping attacks  which are much harder to dodge especially once he pulls his arm off.Instead hit his legs and roll when his stomp hits the ground. Roll away if he falls over and when this happenshe starts pulling his arm off you get lots of free damage. Bait him over to one side and run though his legs to the other to heal safelyYou can find Pate the one sat on the barrel after the balsita room in the area hes just after the turtle with the mace with his back to you after the room with the two spearshield people hell give you a small white soap stone. Put this near the boss to help other player with him. If you kill him you get to stay human which is nice.The ring of binding is also pretty good health caps at  instead of  and youll find that in heides tower of flame which is the area after the forest of fallen giants ,DarkSouls2,cpuornp,1,t5_2vqni

3547992,0,t3_30xfsz,If u go magic forget the MLGS. For a spell sword definitely go get the blue flame. If u are under  int infuse it raw. Over  int u can infuse with magic and buff with CMW but if u intend to melee more i would stick with raw. When buffed with CMW the raw BF will do more melee dmg than a magic infusion. Also keeping it raw will allow u to get the full  extra dmg from robflynn which i would highly recommend for that build. On my battlemage i have min requirements for the BF  int infused it raw with robflynns and it has an AR of  and thats without the CMW buff. TLDR  IMO raw blue flame is wayyyy better and diverse than a MLGS with an offhand staff.Edit use the witchtree branch as a staff to buff your blue flame. Its the lightest staff in the game and has the best casting speed,DarkSouls2,cpwozh9,2,t5_2vqni

3549066,0,t3_30xqen,Its like I have always said...and this just being my experience with the games I have played.  Need to seriously remedy not having played DeS.DkS was a Miyazaki game.  It fucking excelled at a PvE game.  Like one of my top  single player focused games ever.DkS was not.  It had linear unintuitive level design.  Rehashed bosses disguised as fan service.  Sure it added a layer of refinement to mechanics...but outside of the DLCs and the far more important endgame PvP...DkS was not a PvE game but rather a PvP game with a mandatory PvE campaign used to cull items for PvP builds.  I would go so far to say that its mechanics were even refined as far as they were...not for the PvE game...but specifically for the endgame.Then after that...we come to BB.  The highs and lows of that game have been astronomical.  Highs that included the thought that I am playing what I can consider the first amalgamation of perfect storytelling balanced equally with lore tidbits and a cohesive story.  But the multiplayer and even coop components are like taking  steps back from even DkS and running a mile back from where you came from the broken SM driven PvP of DkS.And it made me have unpleasant thoughts.  Because it is hard to harbor unpleasant thoughts toward a man you hold in high respect due to his profound influence on the industry in just  short years.In a perfect world the proverbial Bteam I hate that it is so fucking condescending...but old habits die hard would develop any multiplayer component...and the masterful Miyazaki would do what he does best...world and story craft.  But alas we do not live in a perfect world.Now I ironically had this conversation last night with my significant other.  And expressed much of what I expressed here.  But it is still early days.DkS was pretty broken in general until . and wasnt highly playable until early .And there is always that persistent rumor that Miyazaki hates the PvP mechanic he introduced.Either way I too have a very very strong feeling that SotFS was released not only to satiate Souls fans who did not want to deviate from their platforms of choice...but also because it was evident that the PvP was so frighteningly weak.And it certainly doesnt help there are only like two dozen weapons counting firearms.  Roughly x that counting the other variants.Great game great story great art masterpiece.  Complete and utter shit PvP.  And it is not something easily admitted.,DarkSouls2,cpwtegr,14,t5_2vqni

3552182,0,t1_cpwure7,Keep in mind this is all subjective!gt fps is impossible to adjust toIm a die hard fps supporter but I have to admit I got used to fps. Now I would MUCH prefer fpsp but at fps it still plays fine. Not too many frame drops throughout either in my experience.gt The rolling and dodging feels clunkierI have to strongly disagree with this. To me it feels way smoother. Takes a bit to get used to the sidestep when locked roll when unlocked but it feels at least as smooth as DkS.gt PvP community will be weak in its current state. Theres no way to reliably get v fights.Way too early to say how PvP will be. The thing is we dont even know everything about it yet. I could easily see v PvP working. When the community decides on a designated PvP area ringing the bells there will mostly lead to vs IMO. There will be as much chance of a gank squad as in any previous game.gt Shorter than previous installments.In terms of PvE I have to say it is about the same as previous games. Now it is true you can finish the game with  bosses. However my first playthrough was  hours and I missed a bunch of content. The game should be about h rough estimate on your first playthrough going through all the content and this is excluding chalice dungeons and multiplayer.All in all PvE wise it is probably at the top for me. Combat feels the best out of all the games multiplayer remains to be seen. Low amount of stats might bother me a bit mostly because you only really need to use  to make a strong build.I have several gripes with the game such as QoL improvements that could be made but to me it was worth getting a PS over.  ,DarkSouls2,cpx67j3,12,t5_2vqni

Unfortunately PC got the short end of the stick with this one but everyone here acts so entitled. FROM had to rework a game for current gen consoles and it has to be rerelease because of that. I have no doubt that they care more about their console product because its a much bigger market share. Even if they could just patch push a patch out to the PC version giving it to us for free wouldnt make sense. Yeah it kinda sucks even more if you already bought the dlc but I think  is more than reasonable for the product. I really dont understand why this sub is getting so butthurt over this. If you already own the game and dont want to spend the money great nothing changes for you. Sure maybe a few less people online but its not going to be a ghost town. Fuck theyre still going to push out updates for it. If you dont own the game then its a perfect time to buy it. we were ever deceived or lied to.

Ive briefly taken a look at the code and while relatively new to the RE process it looks like youre basically intercepting the call to the durability damage and replacing it with your custom function to set durability damage independently of framerate.What Im really curious about is how From will deal with such hooks  with available source code and the like it wouldnt be too hard to alter the code for infinite durability etc.  The biggest reason Ive avoided trying to RE games on steam at least is that VAC AFAIK does look for those hooks and might ban you for them even if its not a cheat per se.,DarkSouls2,cq2218d,4,t5_2vqni

Now you may ask but theyll just attack first and YES they will but with the extra  poise and the poise you have on your person you should tank right through it and bulldoze them down to the ground. .If their a backstepper then your best bet is to realise that a backstep is a prediction move NOT a reaction. Therefore you must either attack faster or SLOWER.  Yes I mean run at them and just keep running for a second then attack.

I believe that this is true for many who play these games.  To that extent this thread has heavily intrigued me.  Im on my nd run through of DS and building specifically for PVP.  I understand and appreciate all of your arguments towards having a balanced PVP system which is more focused on skill but personally I am glad weapons such as these exist because of the challenge they represent.  Some of the complaints here seem to go against the very spirit of why many of us play these games.  To face new harder challenges and find ways to overcome them..But maybe Ill eat my words once I experience first hand how bad this weapon really is.  Giant dad was hard but it was beatable.

Any higher and youll find tanky mages and other more stat intensive builds which are cool if youre into that. Lower level pvp is a great time too so lots of options and opinions out there on this subject Sl  keeps you in a smaller range of soul memory so youre slightly less likely to find action compared to high sm pvp but the people you do match with will generally be closer to your level so the fights are also generally fairer as a result.

It will be stronger dark infused and with the points in DEX spent elsewhere of course this means you will have to give up the Hunters Blackbow since it only fits in DEX builds.

3843002,0,t3_34g4fs,Homing Soul Mass and Homing Crystal Soul Mass are what youre looking for as a sorcery version of affinity. Homing Soul Mass is sold by Ornifex and Homing Crystal Soul Mass is found in the Shrine of Amana in the cluster fuck of an area where Peculiar Kindular invades. Soul Spear and Crystal Soul Spear are your heavy hitting nuke spells and are ridiculously powerful if you can land them. Soul Flash is a decent AOE spell for people who get too close but its worse than most other AOE spells none of which are INT based sadly. Then you have various forms of Soul Arrow most of which are more suited for PvE but the homing ones are pretty good. Soul Shower and Soul Vortex are good for area denial and making spacing. Soul Greatsword is cool as fuck and deals a lot of damage and has a surprisingly long range. Aside from that I cant give you very many tips on spells as I havent really dabbled in sorcery much.For weapons literally anything you want if you have the stats for it. For INT specific weapons though Moonlight Greatsword Blue Flame straight sword Ice Rapier dont use it you fucking scrub any Dragonrider weapon Crescent Axe is alright or basically anything that you infuse with magic and buff with CMW.For rings you have the Northern Ritual Band lowers max HP and gives more casts Southern Ritual Band gives you more attunement slots Sorcery Clutch Ring reduces physical defense and increases magic damage for spells and weapons Clear Bluestone Ring increases spell cast time and Lingering Dragoncrest Ring increases duration of spell effects.,DarkSouls2,cquc3v6,8,t5_2vqni

You can also leave red soapstone signs to be summoned for pvp used a cracked red or blue eye orb to invade someone else the rat covenant and bellkeeper covenant are also pvp focussed. As for coop leave your white sign down near bonfires  bosses. The bonfire warp screen will highlight some areas with an orange border theyre the best places to summon for you at that time.

3970996,0,t3_35tq3p,I found it interesting that the idea of the Iron Keep being at a higher elevation was entirely intended by the designersgtTanimura The idea was to have a sea of lava on the top layer. It would have been like a caldera lake in the highlands. The reason we reconsidered this is that when you reached the top the map would be too large and the area would abruptly change making it a little hard to grasp.gtSatake The basis for the idea of Iron Keep is perhaps one of the drawings I made for a different project. Its concept was that of a dam that held back lava. It ended up not being used for that project but every time a new title was made I would ask the producers and directors to consider the idea. The concept of lava being in a high location may have originated from that. It would be too normal if the lava were underground. When you stop to think about how there is a reason that the lava is up there the world appears a little bigger. Such designs that were made while keeping in mind a broadening perspective of the world are found all over.,DarkSouls2,cr8xddx,2,t5_2vqni

4012484,0,t3_36fwy4,Your build looks good. You havent spent many points above softcaps and you have a nice distribution overall. As for Blacksteel Katana you can simply infuse it with Lightning. With that FTH Im pretty sure itll outdamage a noninfused one even if you had  DEX.As for what to infuse next Id sugest anything you feel useful aside from another UGS. You are playing with one and youre being sucessful with it I believe so you should add something faster and more unpredictable for harder situations. UGS are really good for punishing but theyre not something you can engage with unless you bait a hit. And thats risky. So adding a quick weapon as a katana or even an estoc to your arsenal would be nice.With that STR you have no need for more DEX. You have enough STR  DEX to powerstance nearly everything if you need you have enough DEX to wield properly any DEX weapon and with that FTH you are more than able to deal lightning damage  buff yourself. Its a pretty great build now just find a style you like to play!,DarkSouls2,crdnk4y,2,t5_2vqni

4017252,0,t1_cre6tyg,I think youre thinking of hexes and miracles as a sort of blackandwhite dichotomy when thats not really the case. Dark is meant to be more of a force of nature than an evil force in the Souls games. Its just the embodiment of humanity and all that entails. There are plenty of nonmalicious characters who utilize and revere dark the Fenito for example are not destructive or evil just protective and dedicated and even the shards of Manus arent necessarily villains Alsanna. Likewise miracles are not necessarily exclusively good or used to heal they have destructive force as well and followers of the light are not always virtuous as evidenced by the sheer amount of evil priests in both the first and second games.  I think the situation with the Leydia wizards has more to do with them being overambitious. They sought power in learning how to wield life and death like tools and so they were punished for their hubris. Pretty classic story if you ask me.,DarkSouls2,cre73um,8,t5_2vqni

I finally figured out a great way to keep him contained when he takes off running I stand in front of him in the doorway of the room where he starts and whack him with my Great Club.

4152992,0,t1_crtlt1u,Yes that quote from Straid implies that someone will always link the flame.  What he says does not imply that another undead other than your character from dks lights the flame.  It also does not imply that the flame was lit by your character from dks  either so that helps neither of us.  What that implies is that there were kingdomsqueendoms that may have rose and fallen in between the two games.  The character in Dks you play is that someone that links the flame.  Not another undead from Dks.  You argument of other undeads being out there kinda supports my theory more in my eyes because you yourself said there were LOTS of kingdomscycles before so the choice had to be made various times.  one of these times that choice is being made is in Dks.  There are not other undead on the path to light the flame in Dks.  Your character is the only chance.  Just like your character in Dks is the only chance now.

4161198,0,t1_crubr1l,gtsome more NPC interaction. i feels weird that the npcs are all just standing still and never moving about. Majula is a little town.. nobody talks to each other and nobody moves. ever. its weird. thats not human at all. Why bother being in a town if youre not gonna socialize?I would agree if you said something just about movement. For example in DaS Lenigrast moved around from hitting his anvil to moving things on the shelf to sharpening an arrow to looking down at his worktable in exhaustion. That would be more dynamic and great.But the fact that the NPCs dont walk around and interact helped set the mood of Majula and game itself. Majula was beautiful aesthetically and that was juxtaposed by the melancholy atmosphere made by the people who inhabited. If Lenigrast went over to the Manor to shoot the shit with Cale the Cartographer that would be strange.But if when Lenigrasts daughter returned to Majula there was a cutscene or a conversation of them acknowledging each other and piecing together their relationship that would have been interesting to see.,DarkSouls2,crul4fq,1,t5_2vqni

Few katanas stay under  AR but the chaos soft caps around .. Fast reliable moveset with decent range.. No weakness. While its moveset can be countered it has no real problems. Its fasthighly damaging and has a decent reach and also will outrade anything.. Easy to use. While it takes long to actually master even total noobs can easily get some pvp kills with it even if they just R spam while ass they prob wouldnt even get a  out of  if they used the pursuers UGS.. No big stats required. No STR at all needed if you wanna single hand it just put in  STR  dex and thats it. Literally easy as shit.. Weights not really much..

Since Im interested in this type of post and it looks like youll be wanting to do it for a while might I suggest reformatting it in a way that encourages more discussion about the weapon? A good starting spot would be the rDota Hero of the Week discussion posts     As it is your post is more of a my opinion about this weapon post while it could be a post containing factual information about the weapon followed by your opinion!    Important information included in each post could include LoreItem description Link to a youtube video of the moveset Item location Damage values SE... arent exactly representative theres a chart somewhere Id greatly appreciate someone linking pvp montages and other interesting trivia. The wiki page  would be a great place to start.    In addition this format would allow you to consolidate your post into a single weekly thread rather than a weekly thread  followup thread.

However the cycle continues the embers spark and flame returns to the world. In the Dark Lord ending you bring forth the darkness. However the cycle continues the embers spark and flame returns to the world. Thats why theres only one ending in vanilla DS both endings just continue the cycle albeit slightly differently. However the new alternate ending in SotFS is you refusing to become part of the cycle. The cycle continues without you rekindling the flame just the same but you refuse to sacrifice yourself ultimately in vein.,DarkSouls2,cs95ugw,3,t5_2vqni

4321621,0,t1_cscjwy0,Weapon buffs just make the fight shorter by far which means that its only used by people who are bad but still wanna win. When you do more damage you can punish mistakes of others WAY harder than they can punish yours which is basically why balance goes down the drain with weapon buffs. Also no matter how good you are at some point you will run into buffed longsword R spam. If they try  times one maybe works. Same goes for parries. If you try to parry me  times there probably will be a luckyshot parry in there e.g. I used R instead of R to avoid your parry and your missed timing still lets you parry my R. Its not that buckler parry spam is inferior to small shields but people with a buckler are usually desperate to parry like you you did nothing else lol so they WILL spam it. Again its not the item itself but the mindset it comes with.And yeah burrs are a thing. So are warlock mask black witch top and the chaos set. If I really want to I could shut down every magebuff build easily. It doesnt make it more interesting to fight tho.There is somehow skill involved in landing parries of course. But if you literally have to try  or  times to get one its just the spam carrying you through. Oh and parries are rarely used by good players like really good that people that dont play anymore because its too big of a risk. Good players also wont get parried more than once by the same tactic so its a very unreliable tactic. Yes parrying can take skill but the fact that youre thinking about parries as topnotch gameplay just shows that youre a bad player which is fine we all were at that point.. just  months ago.,DarkSouls2,cscrxn0,1,t5_2vqni

4465128,0,t3_3c9e4x,I would really keep the majestic greatsword uninfused because it gets really good physical scaling especially in your left hand. Make sure youre using it in your left hand! I played around with your stats a little bit and came up with this Vigor past  is usually better spent elsewhere. Your AR is going to be much higher with this build. Your Ring of blades will now give you the full bonues of  when you uninfuse your majestic greatsword. At  vit flynns ring will give you . Sacred oath with give you  and with your str and dex at  you will gain about  physical damage due to scaling alone.  If you really want to be below  let me know and I can rework this build around it but I use  builds all the time and usually have no trouble. Also I just threw the blue tearstone ring on as a place holder you can use the old leo ring still if you like. I think it really helps if you plan on using the thrust combo frequently.  Now lets talk strategyMajestic GS is a super fun weapon and also super powerful. Your basic handed Rs are your jab. They dont do a ton of damage but they cover a wide range and come out fast. They are basically used just to control the area in front of you and for pressuring your opponent. The wide sweep is great for catching people who like to roll into you. The R is a badass double spin attack that knocks people on their ass. This attack is REALLY good. The most important thing about this attack is that it completely ignores poise so its fantastic against havel monsters and the like. It doesnt matter if they have  poise iron flesh and hyper frames activated this attack will still knock them on their keister! This attack is great for people who like to roll behind you everybody. If youre using your Rs correctly then most weapons will have trouble attacking you directly from the front unless they have more reach than you. Most people will try to solve this problem by rolling under your attacks and attack your exposed back. When they try to do that just hit that sexy R button and you suddenly have a  double attack around you that will knock anyone away. I cant stress how great this move is for hard countering some peoples playstyles. Im a evil person so when I knock someone down with the R I like to use a nice big AOE spell so they take even more damage on wake up. Its almost impossible to avoid a point blank outcry cast! The twohanded movest is strong and has access to a long range poke and a longer range flip. If you land the poke you can combo into a flip for style points more damage and a knockdown which can be followed by a firestorm outcry..ect. You can also use the L flip for dealing with spear users but your timing needs to be spot on because its start up is rather slow. Youll learn more as you mess around with it have fun! ,DarkSouls2,csti9gu,5,t5_2vqni

You have to be very familiar with all aspects of the weapon to have a decent chance so I say just keep trying and dying.Though in my experience the BKGA is pretty bad.

4605003,0,t3_3e2h4j,I ended up building a pyromelee build that I seriously enjoy.  Im not at home so I cant give you the stats.  Basically I started as Cleric and leveled up mostly my faith to get the fire damage up.As far as weapons go the Fire Longsword never left my right hand once I picked it up.  You can get it after the Last Gaint by turning around from the second bonfire and dropping onto the scaffolding.  The Chaos Rapier is also a fantastic weapon for fire damage and you can get it pretty early from Felkin.  Both weapons can take you through the whole game if you upgrade them to  and  respectively and are light weight.  Fire Longsword requires a small investment into STR and DEX.  Chaos Rapier requires a heavier stat investment but a lot of that investment boosts your fire damage too.  Both are light weight so you can keep VIT pretty low.  Use whatever armor you want.  I recommend Penal Handcuffs to boost your pyro damage and Hexers Hood to give yourself at least one extra cast of each spell.  Southern ritual band is a must.  And use the regular pyro flame thats in the chest in the room after the Flexile Sentry.,DarkSouls2,ctb1okd,1,t5_2vqni

Theyre all either PvP invasion PvP duelling PvEampP endgame dungeon or a CoOp covenant that Ill never use because nobody ever summons me when I bother to try anyway and it takes away from the time I could be grinding out all the spawns in my home world. Im shit at PvP and Im not ashamed of that and theres no reason for me to be in any other covenant other than for short bursts  I might decide to go BellBros for chunks someday or go RatBro to piss around again in the future and if I want to grind an area like the Ogre in FoFG  souls per kill very easy levels Ill hop into the Covvy of Champs getting an Awestone or two in the process.Really though Id like to have the Blue covenants merged to allow Sentinels to call upon their friends in times of need and repay that aid to one another choosing either to call out for aid or call out to give it by choosing which ring to use or possibly just a straightup option that can be changed easily. ,DarkSouls2,ctfn4c6,2,t5_2vqni

4671800,0,t3_3exxas,Ive only tried one RobFlynn build before and unless Ive got it all wrong I assumed it made more sense to make use of a fast weapon as opposed to a hard hitting weapon. Nothing I say is going to represent how damage actually works in the game just an example  Say you use a greatsword and it hits for  damage on something. With RobFlynn it now hits  again not how this works but just the concept. You can only swing once every  second.Now lets take a Rapier. It does  damage per hit. With RobFlynn it now does . And it can hit  times in a second. Totalling to  damage comparing to the Greatswords .Now all those numbers are total fluff and made up who knows how many hits a rapier can get in during a greatsword swing. But the point I am trying to make is that rings that boost AR in general are only useful on fast weapons. I dont even use Ring of Blades if I am using a slow hard hitting weapon it barely adds anything to it. However if you are using a nice fast weapon the damage really adds up. For this reason I would pick your favourite fast hitting weapon. Warped Sword Espada Ropera are a few of my favourite dex examples. Craftsmans Hammer Caestus are fun strength alternatives.Beside on a RobFlynn build since you only have . equip load you cant afford to be using . of that weight on your Greatsword. That puts you at  equip load already not including armour or rings. Use a light weapon to enable you to use the preferred armour of your choice and stay with as high an equip load as you are comfortable with. I as a rule generally try stay under  at all times. On my fast builds I will always stay under .,DarkSouls2,ctjfk0d,2,t5_2vqni

4686630,0,t1_ctkxnu3,gt One argument I would make is that the crushing and sharp varieties of weapons allow you to use particular weapons for their move sets as supposed to having to give up damage or moves. For example if you had a Dex build but you also wanted a backup weapon for wide sweeping attacks you could use a greatsword or ugs that was made sharp.but... you cant. you can only upgrade dex weapons and quality weapons that favour dex along the sharp path. the same is true for strcrushing. thats how it is in DeS thats what im talking about and thats why its stupidpointless again in DeS as it is done there if it wasnt obviousbut then if you allow every weapon to be upgraded along all the paths then whats the point of the different stats? just for PvP minmaxing? that doesnt sound like a good upgradeweapon system. if you like the movesets of Str weapons why not just go with a str build in the first place? and if you really want to only use it as a backup im sure theres another weapon with a similar movesetcharacteristics but with innate dex scalingits better to go DaSstyle and have onetwo weapons per almost every class with different scaling andor moveset or other special properties which are usually weaker than their proper scaling counterpars but keep a few classes statexclusive that way the strdex differentiation doesnt lose most of its meaning but you can still dick around and experiment and you dont have to grind for  different upgrade materials for a significant amount of your playtime,DarkSouls2,ctlalvr,2,t5_2vqni

4751205,0,t3_3fzl1q,Edit To summarize mine and everyone elses replies heres a list of rare drops that have been posted in the thread so far Lion Warrior Helm and Red Lion Warrior Cape from the Golden Lion in Shaded Woods.  This mob does not have normal respawn mechanics and you must kill Najka again before youre able to burn another ascetic to respawn him. Monastery Set from the red phantom in Aldias Keep hallway in NG and onwards.  Requires an ascetic to respawn.  Unsure if you need to kill the Guardian Dragon boss in order to use another ascetic. Cursed Bone Shield from the red phantom in Huntsmans Copse or from the single Aldia Warlock in Aldias Keep the second one has normal mob respawning mechanics so you can farm it infinitely without burning an ascetic if you join CoC. Black Witch Domino Mask from the Avelyn black phantoms in Belfry Luna.  There are two of them in the zone but dont respawn after being killed unless you use an ascetic. Black Hollow Mage Robes Mask and Lizard Staff from the onetime Necromancer spawn in the Huntsmans Copse cave.  These can be farmed infinitely without ascetics if you kill the  Necromancers inside the Executioners Chariot fight and featherhomeward bone out or die without killing the boss itself.  The White Hollow Mage Robes Mask and Bat Staff are rare drops from the White Hollow Mages in Brightstone Cove but can be farmed with a lot more ease than the black set due to having normal mob respawning mechanics and being found plentifully throughout the zone. The Insolent set items are now rare drops from the black phantoms in Undead Crypt which spawn after you light the statue that lights up the zone.  These can only be farmed by using an ascetic.  PreSotFS you could buy the set from Agdayne so that is one of the only setsitems that is rarerharder to obtain in SotFS than it was in Vanilla DaS. Old Mirrah Greatsword from the red phantom that spawns in the hallway right as you enter Aldias Keep.  This can only be farmed by burning ascetics. The Black Dragon weapons Sword Greataxe Warpick Shield and Greatsword from the Dragon Knights at Dragon Shrine.  The Greatsword can be obtained by reaching rank  of the Dragonbro covenant but also as a very rare drop from the Black Dragon Knight red phantom that spawns in front of the petrified egg.  Farming for the Greatsword would require ascetics but the rest of the weapons and shield can be farmed infinitely from the Dragon Knights with CoC. The Shadow set including the Shadow Dagger and Malformed Claws are rare drops from the Suspicious Shadows that spawn in Lost Bastille No Mans Wharf and Earthen Peak.  They are rare drops but can be farmed infinitely using CoC.  PreSotFS they could only be farmed by killing the  adds that spawned with the NG Flexile Sentry boss in No Mans Wharf so they arent as rare as they used to be but obtaining the full set can still be extremely tedious. Manikin Claws are a rare drop that apparently only drop from the  Manikins before Covetous Demon in the area that you can only access by jumping down onto the ledge above the poison pool.  PostSotFS it seems that theyre no longer exclusive to those  and can be dropped by any of the Manikins in Earthen Peak.  Can be farmed using CoC. Other notable mentions are the Old Knight UGS Drakekeeper set Ruin set Imperious set Fume Sorcerer set including Umbral Dagger and Blue Dagger Rampart Golem set and probably several others that Im forgetting.  These sets arent necessarily difficult to farm but the drops are classified as rare and with poor RNG you could end up with a dozen gloves before you get a single chest piece to drop just an example.,DarkSouls2,cttfn7r,23,t5_2vqni

4856992,1,t3_3heg1v,Hard Leather set just like in DS.  Its way too heavy to justify having no poise and yet for its weight its not really better than comparable alternatives.  There is absolutely no reason to ever use hard leather  either use a lighter set if you dont care about poise or wear a heavier set and gain the benefits of poise in addition to better defenses.Bleedstones and Bleed Serum.  Bleed is absolutely fucking awful in DS.  About the only time its even a factor is when youre being hit by darkstalkers who apparently have like  billion bleed aux on their attacks or youre getting gangfucked by manikins who are probably the most overpowered bullshit monsters in the game after the lightning ponies.  And even then its only  damage... not very much considering it takes several hits for a player weapon to proc it.  Bleed infuse dramatically reduces base AR and scaling and gives you a weak aux bonus for by far the weakest and least useful status effect in the game.  Bleed Serum looks fucking badass at least.  Bleedstones routinely get vendored at Gavlan since theres not even a reason to Bleed infuse a shield  darkstalkers arent really that big of a threat and if someones running a Bleed build in PvP enjoy your free souls.I personally feel like most ultra greatswords greataxes and great hammers are pretty useless.  Incredibly slow fucked up controls and while they hit hard I feel like regular greatswords and other weapons are just generally more reliable  I feel like most of the time you can hit twice with a smaller weapon in the time it takes to hit once with a greatweapon and often end up doing more total damage.  I guess a greatweapon is nice for killing things in one hit but unless youre greatly outleveling the area youre in thats pretty rare.,DarkSouls2,cu6re1r,0,t5_2vqni

Kill them.This whole notion of honor in combat is hilariously pointless and its primarily spread by people who like using buffs. Far as im concerned a buff is an attack. Most of the time I have no problem meeting up with the host making sure he knows im there and is prepared and then fighting one on one. But you have zero obligation to let someone buff themselves or their weapon and if they complain at you for attacking theyre just being a child. I feel the same way about Estus use during invasions. The only aside to that is Red Sign Soapstones and Dragon Signs. If youre willingly summoning someone into your world for the purpose of a duel then by all means fight fairly.People will say that Bellbros constitute willingly summoning someone into your world. In an area where you will almost certainly be fighting two gray spirits plus the NPCs in the area that doesnt count. If youve cleared all the NPCs out and youre only fighting one guy then its up to you.End of the day it comes down to who won the fight and most people wont even remember your name twenty minutes later.,DarkSouls2,cu91h6i,4,t5_2vqni

4927337,0,t1_cufkea7,Something along those lines. There were times when the recoil would not fully coincide with the damage interval but it is difficult to tell how exactly it works because timing doesnt easily add up.I tested it on the dark orb like attacks from the female leydia mages in the crypt. Sometimes the damage would be hard to notice and seemingly no damage was taken while other times I had reduced amounts. There were also times when the damage increased perhaps this was a counter modifier from the orb attack.One problem is that the charakter moves back due the recoil effect and as such it is difficult to estimate if the attack made contact at the same moment compared to before.The second problem is that spells do different damage over longer ranges and sometimes obstacles get in the way or the aim was off. AI can act odd sometimes some npc invaders throw their lighting spears at walls for example.Thirdly I have no fitting experience with recording software and as such there is no data and math to accuratly go by.Fourth the prisoners would move in the way if I got too close.Lastly this might be an innate property of this greatbow. The description hints at ceremonial uses. It could be a spell parry effect or hyperframes I lack the experience to tell at the moment.,DarkSouls2,cufmorp,1,t5_2vqni

And then when you come back later and youre trying to plan out your next move from the upper ledge he jumps up and facefucks you out of nowhere. I was pretty disappointed that there wasnt a interesting mandatory boss at the end of the tutorial in DS. ampnbspThat being said I dont have nearly as many problems with the game as a lot of DS fans have.

Why Duel bridge for duelling. Hes the kind of guy that not only invades cracked orb but attacks while youre duelling someone and ruins it. He did just that now. Was a really close battle and he killed my opponent from the back. He must like it from behind pun intended. Meager life that i had left as well... So if you see him come in. Stop duelling.

5391021,0,t3_3ov7hd,Hen you talk about Giants in DkS are you talking about the big grey dumb except Gough guys or the taller humanoids Silver Knights etc? Because anatomically the DkS Giants arent much different to the DkS Gough Giants. We nver see their faces so they could have holes for all we know. So yeah I agree with you. I also had the idea if Giants turning into Archtrees.Now regarding the Age of Dark I dont think such a thing can really exist. See Dark depends on Fire just as much as Light does. Fire brought Dark and we already know what a world without Fire looks like. If the Flame died Dark would go with it. You cant have Light without Dark they are two sides of the same coin as the Bow of Want description puts it. There can only be an Age of Fire Light and Dark exist or an Age of Ancients no Light or Dark. But I agree that DkS takes place in a timeline in which the Chosen Undead let the Flame die as the Gods are no longer in power. But with the door to the Kiln flung wide open any old sod could walk in and relight it. Thats what I think has happened the CU became the Dark Lord and the Gods fled. Humans became the dominant race. But at some point before the Flame died another Undead walked in and Linked the Fire. Hell that scenario probably played out several times. Thats the Cycle of Dark Souls the folly of mankind.  ,DarkSouls2,cw0rhwm,5,t5_2vqni

5397557,0,t3_3ouxxs,Ok I was going to reply to ubranchingfactors post but for some reason the reply button isnt working on my phone. Switching to magic can actually help you as much as using a bow if you have the binoculars from Majula. A littleknown fact is you can cast spells while looking through the binoculars and it will serve to aim in the direction youre looking just like a bows manual aiming function but without the crosshairs. This will help you take out enemies that are too far away to lockon to. If you feel you would enjoy switching to a magic build I would highly recommend picking these babies up they come in handy in many areas of the game. Or you could use a bow whichever tickles your fancy. Its always a good idea to have some kind of reliable ranged attack so either choice worksampnbspEDIT Also looking at the build you posted it looks good for the most part but for the love of all that is fuck please level your ADP. ADP affects Agility abbreviated to AGL in your player stats screen and gives you more frames of invincibilty during your rolls. This means even if an attack looks like it hits you while rolling it wont actualy affect you in any way. It also lets you use consumables ie estus flasks much more quickly. Youre gonna want to AGL to at least  to get the real benefits. ampnbspATN also increases AGL but at a much slower rate so its recommended you level ADP somewhat until youre high enough level to be able to respec and get to  AGL through ATN alone.,DarkSouls2,cw1lixt,2,t5_2vqni

5456890,0,t3_3pt3kl,I would say it mostly depends on where you are in the game and how skilled you are in general. For me on a brand new character  is my too much to risk cap. Late game however is a bit different. You can go longer without dying and you have a lot LESS to do with your souls unless you want to level up. At this point leveling takes about    souls so that becomes my new cap. If you want to stick to a specific SM though I would recommend using up all your souls as soon as you get the opportunity. If you have enough to level up and you plan on leveling up even if its just one level do it. Feel free to use consumable souls in majula if your just short of the mark. Also spend smaller excess on things like lifegems or HWbones to prevent further soul loss down the road. Thats my advice. Good luck to you regardless of whether or not you choose to follow it.,DarkSouls2,cw963sf,3,t5_2vqni

5467018,0,t3_3pwzdp,I have a small theory that states that the cycle has been repeated for eons however the cycle of DS was the first one to break it not allowing the souls to combine into  big fire and restarting the cycle. My theory goes like this first big flame the era of light were gods roam the earth and they create a lot of things like animals constructions dragons etc with this power but it ends when they see the fire fading out and they let it die and the dark souls start to flow from the darkness and now it is the time of the men. No gods left just darkness. However the souls never dissipated they get gathered by the dark lord and when he finishes gathering all of them... the cycle starts all over.,DarkSouls2,cwagol8,1,t5_2vqni
5471163,0,t1_cwakiw9,This is a very good discussion!I think that this point brings out a good comparison to Dark Souls  amp . You got very few material rewards for cooperating in Dark Souls  where as in Dark Souls  you get greater material rewards for cooperating as well as restoring your humanity.In the lack of an external reward you are driven to an internal one an internal reason why you are helping this player be it lore driven or just to help a player. You are also right it can be selfish e.g. I want to see this boss before I fight it for real but I think that in the absence of a material reward something that can contribute to your social standing albeit it in an imagined group e.g. giving tokens of spite to titchy gren an internal reward is why people engage in altruistic rewards in Dark Souls .Me and my friend discuss this more in our second video where we focus on covenants directly and this internal vs. external rewards.

It has nothing to do with the actual parry mechanic it has everything to do with the connection you have your opponent.As for the video nice edits solid compisition I really enjoyed it.

With weapons try to look for weapons that have innate magic damage.On stats Do you want more spells or more weapon damage? If you want more spells put points primarily into Attunement and Intelligence with just enough points in Strength and Dexterity to wield your weapon of choice. If you want weapon damage focus more on Strength and Dexterity based on the weapon you want to use and leave your Attunement at   slots for spells enough if you want a buff and a few damage spells while leveling your Intelligence to about  for the buffs and a few damage spells.Rings should likely be the Southern Ritual Band Clear Bluestone Ring and two slots for whatever you want.

I actually prefer using bigger heavier hitting weapons in PVE but for PVP I love spears.By the way I almost always two hand the spear instead of using  hand and shield although there have been a few matches where I pull out a shield due to how my opponent is acting.

5888649,0,t3_3vx9p1,I was recently playing a no death run taking on Scorpioness Najka very early on. I wanted to farm for the Tseldora Manchettes as quickly as possible. This was a grave mistake. All was going well my manscorpion buddy was tanking most of the hits I had successfully blocked a battery of homing soul spears with my watchdragon parma my  falchion was making short work of that mad magic arachnid bitch while my trusty but unfashionable drangleic mail was absorbing a nice amount of damage. I had probably around  of my  VGR healthbar when disaster struck. By now any Dark Souls veteran will have guessed what happened  I screwed up a roll and got hit by the dreaded toxic grab attack. I have never survived the fight after being hit by it before  the toxic kills you so fast and stopping to chug estus and eat moss is an open invitation to an asswhopping. But wait! Such forethought  despite having literally never used one in all my hundreds of hours of Dark Souls the consequences of nodeath had inspired me to equip my two divine blessings to my quickslot just after my lifegems. While suspended in the air sucking a nasty dose of scorpion toxin in through my gut I selected my blessing and after being thrown down and regaining my footing mashed the use button and saw the toxin disappear and my health bar shoot back up. Just in time to tank the hit that I was unable to avoid while in the use animation. Then me and my main manscorpion finished the bitch off...

This means it is in fact not a waste of points at all as it has proven beneficial to them.If you are as skilled as you claim and casters are so unskilled then they should be no problem for you. The sheer amount of bellyaching in this post implies that they are very much a problem for you. If you cannot defend the claim of nonmelee builds being unfair then you must admit they are at the very least skilled enough to beat you.You are unable to cast spells as a direct result of choosing to neglect those specific stats. That is a consequence of your and only your choices. The casters you are evidently getting your ass handed to by are in no way shape or form responsible for your choice of stats.Well try this again with logic construct a valid argument explaining what is unfair about using healing abilities.,DarkSouls2,cy1a9b4,10,t5_2vqni

6154943,0,t1_cyonhik,I dont believe Heides Tower of Flame is Anor Londo  the devs pretty clearly said that DS takes place in a different location. I think Vaati has the most compelling theory on this which is that Heides Tower of Flame was built by Gwynevere and her Husband Flame God Flann who fled from Anor Londo. That definitely explains the similar architecture the Flame part and The Old Dragonslayer  more on him in a bit.    Of course the fact that the place has all but sunk into the ocean and is largely populated by Knights wearing really old gear implies that a lot of time must indeed have passed between DS and DS. However between the Undead Curse and the weirdness of time in the Dark Souls universe time doesnt necessarily stand in the way of people  like a Black Knight becoming Syan for example  persisting until the events of DS.     Take the Old Dragonslayer. He drops a ring Ornstein was given an aged version and you use his soul to get a spear much like Ornsteins  it even shoots lightning bolts which the Old Dragonslayer doesnt use. Theres some speculation that Ornstein being a personal guard of the princess would have accompanied her and that the Ornstein you face in DS is some kind of illusion like Gwynevere  though there are some problems like being able to get his stuff back then as well and the fact that he seems a lot more tangible than his princess. Though if you assume the Old Dragonslayer is indeed Ornstein he then may have been corrupted in some way explaining his use of dark magic. But even if you dont buy into that theory theres still the Old Knights who apparently have been using their gear for so long its degraded to near unusability which to me implies they have been guarding that place for far longer than your average knights lifespan.    All that indicates to me that its quite possible some of the people of Anor Londo may have survived well into and even beyond King Vendricks reign. Who knows what happens to those already marked by the Undead Curse after the First Flame is rekindled? Maybe a sufficiently strong undead could resist hollowing for centuries. Of course it would be odd for Vendrick to allow one of the generally shunned undead into his army but...anythings possible I suppose. Im getting pretty far out there with the speculation though.    Lastly the elevator. Its an unfortunate symptom of the disjointedness that emerges when a games map is split up and distributed among different teams. I definitely hope DS is going to feel as organic and consistent as the first.,DarkSouls2,cyp93q1,2,t5_2vqni

6175167,0,t3_404f8h,The slow down... you are talking about turtle knight right?It is a shockwave quake effect but I am pretty sure you can dodge it. Dark Souls  did some major change in the combat mechanics some for better and some for worst. Personally I prefer Dark Souls mechanic. You just need to get used to it and hopefully will eventually can enjoy the game despite this overall minor changes.Unless in freak accident you decided to drop Dark Souls  altogether and pick other franchise which also have deep combat mechanic like Monster Hunter or Dragon Dogma which out on PC next Friday btw you might want to want to keep going on till the end. I recommend you pushing through Dark Souls  since itll deepen your lorestory understanding of Dark Souls and prepare you for Dark Souls  coming out this April. Dark Souls  by itself isnt bad by any means most people expecting Dark Souls  similar to its predecessor which it didnt and ending up disappointed  but if you regard Dark Souls  as standalone game and standalone franchise perhaps you can appreciate the quality of Dark Souls .  Also youll get to experience the fantastic  DLCs which in my experience is closer to Dark Souls in term of bosses and worldarea design. Great new for whoever enjoy Dark Souls.tldr Dark Souls  is different than Dark Souls stop comparing them will be a great way to enjoy both game. ,DarkSouls2,cyrjwuk,1,t5_2vqni

6210015,0,t1_cyvhdvl,Well I think you are very wrong when you say this baiting stuff works only on predictable opponents or alternatively everyone is predictable. For example I actually told my friend called Abuketofskittles a really good player he kills me more often than not one time up front that I was planning on parrying him with a zweihnder. He kept telling me that I wouldnt be able to do it. In the first  or so matches I managed to parry him two times and those parries are on the video one of them was one of those feeling lucky parries though so dunno if it counts. Then he became really careful and beat my ass over and over... but my point is that even my friends who know I hunt for zwei parries sometimes fall for those baits its ridiculous. I have to get more creative every time I do pull one off though.If you dont want to start breaking down my montage you should at least try it out once my tutorial comes out.

Actually that was pretty genius BUT STILL FUCK THEM.The running guy takes the cake though. Invaded in the Fume Sorceress maze and he runs to the bonfire and heals. I cast Warmth. He runs past me into the maze. He runs back up the ladder oh if I had Fire Snake attuned to the bonfire. Then  now get this  then that motherfucker runs around the pit for FIVE FUCKING MINUTES and because Im at . equip load his stamina comes back faster. I get out a bow because fuck cosplay at this point and he starts playing hide behind the central pillar. Eventually I keep running at him and somehow catch up at which point he turns around and kills me in about two seconds with a dark Ice Rapier because Im mad and wielding the slowest damn thing in the fucking game. I rageadd him and ask why that was so fucking hard and he replies that he was switching equipment. Switching equipment. For over five minutes. Thank the bloody Lord of Sunlight you had time to fine tune your fashion souls while trying to make my invasion time out am I right?

Eventually you figure out that you need a thing to see the murderkitty.Then the whole area is filled with dudes with far more poise than most guys of their size in the non DLC areas. Plus a number of them cant be backstabbed. Plus theyre quite happy to sit there and spam the ranged attack of their infinite durability Ice Rapeiers at you. Oh and since youre basically bashing your weapon off of blocks of ice your weapon durability drops like crazy. I actually had to use repair powders to keep my stuff from breaking.So you finally get the McGuffin to make the invisible murderkitty visible. Awesome! Get to the next area. Oh hey another boss fight! Except youre swarmed by dudes. You know that area you just cleared out? DO IT AGAIN! Except now all those chicks being all peaceful? Yeah now theyll attack you. And theres more shit to explore now. Also remember the bonewheels from Dark Souls ? Picture them half the height so a number of weapon moves cant even hit them namely horizontal swings. Oh and you take damage from touching them. Yeah you fight them. A lot of them.So now you saved the dudes and you can fight the boss! Alright! Did you know that you shouldnt kill him now? Those dudes that swarm you? Yeah you need their souls so you can get some swag gear and if you beat the boss you have to rely on being summoned to get the souls.So you farmed the souls got the swag gear and finally killed the boss. Are you done yet? Nope! Theres one area left! And its filled with snowstorms and lightning rapedeer. I had enough of the DLCs bullshit at that point.One. Giant. Troll.,DarkSouls2,d02cdcq,13,t5_2vqni

Evidence in the game leads to the fact that the surviving Drakebloods from Shulva went on to form the Archdrake Sect of Lindelt to preserve the culture of Shulva in order for them to atone for their sins. A selfish act as the game frames it for they only want salvation from their guilt. Theres also an underlying hypocrisy in the sect because you see in Shulva magic was considered a blasphemous act same as Lindelt a land well known for the miracles they preach. Yet when venturing into the Shrine of Amana we find Archdrakes using magic through staves the Archdrake Staff specifically showcase the hypocrisy the sect has when it comes to their views of magic but perhaps they believed that they were a necessary evil that must fight back against the magic they regard with disgust.,DarkSouls2,d0qmj7j,1,t5_2vqni

6927890,0,t3_4altv6,Immorality may not be the best lens to view this topic through however it can at least be looked through from the perspective of player enjoyment. While it should be implied that the invader is finding some enjoyment in invading invasions also have the potential to be a visceral frightening and ultimately enjoyable experience for the person being invaded. It can also be utterly demoralizing when players are struggling with getting through a particular part of the game only to be completely destroyed by something they may have not been entirely prepared for. It depends on the person being invaded. Some people relish the accomplishment in overcoming the unforeseeable adversity posed in player invasions. The fact the many players go out of their way to disconnect from the online would show that others arent as keen on these elements. What makes it difficult to judge is that you cant tell a players stance on invasions before you invade them. Just because someone plays online doesnt mean they want to partake in the pvp or more importantly deserve the invasions as some bizarre form of punishment invoked by the invader. Yes its part of the game but that doesnt imply that players unequivocally sign up for invasions with open arms and buttholes.Im not going to say that invasions are bad or that their inclusion in the series is a hindrance but at least be aware that not everyone finds them fun even if they are connected online.

6994480,0,t1_d1942cj,In no real order some things to help you.You need to kill one thing by the first door on the right. Either of the mobs on either side of that door will do. Every other time just run through grab the Frozen Flower and run up the stairs again theres nothing major behind any of those six doors that you need other than the route through.Seems like youre using weapons that slash against mobs that are resistant to slash because theyre made of stone. Get a strike weapon and the stats to use it. I would suggest a Caestus from Meletia the hag in Majula or Cardinal Tower if you didnt complete conversation with her. Yes theyre close range but theyre quick and scale off DEX. This is probably why youre not dealing low damage.If needs be just put a few points into STR so you can wield other weapons. If you dont want to put any points into STR fair enough thats your call but at means that you have to play within the restrictions youre imposing on yourself.Remember For the most part the game is a fair system. You just have to within it.Oh btw after this part youll be facing four Syan Knights thatll start off as statues...,DarkSouls2,d1960z4,1,t5_2vqni

The vast majority of people working on each of those games are the absolute same every time. The only noteworthy difference was the project leader for DkS  Shibuya at first then Tanimura.Seeing as From is still a relatively small company it would be weird if it was any different. They simply do not have the resources to have different teams. They have one team with some members working on this some members working on that game at any given time but pretty much everyone is involved in every game at some time.Lastly its news to me that Miyazaki had plans for a DkS  led by him.

7193158,0,t3_4dzb8h,I actually just soloed him for the first time earlier today on NG no less. Here are some tips that helped me and things I found helped immensely. . Roll Left. Almost all of his attacks are much less likely to hit you if you are on his left side. Furthermore he lacks any serious get the fuck away from me swipes at his side like the Fume Knight has. . When Alonne uses his forwardslide vertical slash it is often best to roll backward. Be careful when timing this. This attack does tons of damage but has a very easily identifyable tell. Alonne will often leap backwards not always. He must have distance before using this move and then hold his sword horizontally at his waist similar to the H R of the Blacksteel Katana. There is a good bit of leeway to when you can roll backward and still be safe. Beware this move has a surprising amount of leftright tracking which is why it is best to roll back. . Pump points into adaptability. The difference between  and  adaptability was everything in my fight. It went from me dying in seconds upon starting to me becoming a part of Sir Alonnes dance of death and killing him on the second try postrespec.  I also used a Fume Greatsword  with about  strength and  dex.,DarkSouls2,d1vswqi,2,t5_2vqni

The Longsword is a wonderful choice for this The Claymore is a great choice if you want a heavier weapon.The most important part of choosing a weapon is to find one with a moveset that you like since most of them will be different. Quality builds are great for experimenting with different weapons since you usually will meet the requirements. So try a bunch of weapons out until you find one you really like. Then be sure to find a blacksmith and upgrade it as high as you can. Upgrading your main weapon is your  priority even more than levelling up.,DarkSouls2,d28dvqe,3,t5_2vqni

FromSoft decided to put a ton of bosses into the game  more than DS in fact. Would you really rather have had them remove the Twin Dragonriders but only have  more bosses? That outlook makes no sense to me. Removing the  worse bosses from DS would give it the best average boss quality of any game in the series yet the game isnt worse off for having them in fact Id argue the game benefits. All removing the  worse bosses would do is give people like you less reasons to criticize Dark Souls . ,DarkSouls2,d312atf,4,t5_2vqni

7584403,0,t1_d34696k,All of your rings are good except restoration but depending on certain things there are better options. Royal Soldiers Ring is only worth using if you need stacked defence. Its a good ring if you are playing a super tanky build. A better ring in general would be the Third Dragons Ring. Chloranthy Ring is good for a superspeedy dexquality build. For a middle of the road or a tanky build you dont need to be as aggressive as chloranthy ring allows you to be so I think its wasted. There are  shields in the game that give you Stamina regeneration that you can use instead if you want that effect. The Third Dragons Ring also replaces this in a small capacity since it increases stamina. Ring of Steel Protection is a ring that I use when Im using cloth armor with high elemental defence but low physical defence. Its not a bad ring but I think depending on certain variables there are better options. Oh my god the Third Dragon Ring replaces this too! Since it gives you more HP. Ring of Restoration is just bad no matter the circumstances. Any other ring would be better.Now what I think you should be wearing Third Dragons Ring  if you want it its a very good ring. Lighting Clutch Ring  increases Lighting damage. Very good for your faith build. Stone Ring is one of my favorites. Great for stunlocking your enemies. Works great with your spear. Since you are using a spear I would strongly recommend the Old Leo Ring.You can still use you old rings not restoration if you still like them a lot but these four rings are what I would suggest.,DarkSouls2,d34b5mv,2,t5_2vqni

7594017,0,t3_4jbue4,Yeah you go in this game with a melee build and think youre gonna conquer it like DS and youre gonna have a bad time. The games core combat is just not as tightly designed as DS. Its not you btw its just the way the game is built up. Like you said super poise heat seeking missiles that just seem to catch you no matter how hard you try to avoid getting caught.The best way to play DS is to treat it like an adventure game with combat and not as pure action game. You just need to come at this game with a different mind set and let the bullshit roll of you. Id say play until you finish Undead Crypt and then reevaluate your experience I feel like by then youd have faced most of what the game will throw at you. If you managed to get by and feel ok with the game then get SOTFS if not then maybe just save up for DS since that plays exactly like DS did.I think its in your best interest to try and come around to DS though. The DLC is amazing and worth every penny but if youre constantly fighting with the game then it wont get better with SOTFS. In fact SOTFS doubles and sometimes even triples down on its bullshit. DS is its own thing entirely and after playing DS Im beginning to appreciate it more than I ever did. Its so free and unshackled by the previous game that it has become its own thing entirely even with DSs release.,DarkSouls2,d35egpw,3,t5_2vqni

7706676,0,t3_4kvc79,What usually seems to happen is that games carry with them their first impressions over their whole lives.  So people really liked Dark Souls .  Then Dark Souls  came out and the obvious comparisons came about and Dark Souls  was generally deemed bad worse than Dark Souls .   But the only part of that statement that stuck was that Dark Souls  sucks.  Even now after plenty of DLC and SotFS came out that first impression still sticks.And with Dark Souls  its the same.  By and large Ive heard that its a great game havent played it yet. But I hear little snippets of  information that show that it clearly has flaws.

7719094,0,t1_d3jhru7,I agree I never really had an issue with adp.  I know Im basically the only one but I actually didnt mind Soul memory either...at least after they added the agape ring for people who did hate it. The nice thing about it for me though was that once you hit a certain tier you always had people to play against.  You could make a competent late game pve character and still easily match for pvp.  It added a lot of variation in the people you played against too.  Sometimes it was a weaker opponent that you would squish sometimes you were on equal footing and sometimes they had you completely outclassed...to me that was the beauty of it.  One thing I never really liked about SL matchmaking is that when you know your opponent is at the same range as you invasions and duels lose a lot of the suspense and surprise that comes with not having a clue what your opponent can do next.,DarkSouls2,d3jlw8s,1,t5_2vqni

7783785,0,t1_d3qvzw1,How exactly is it presented as a punishment? You can literally get the Ring of Binding in the first hour into the game. Its a mechanic that mainly serves to further enforce the harsh atmosphere as well as work as part of the mechanical narratives the souls games are known for in which it makes it so that Hollowing as an occurance happens slowly as the character starts losing their memories they forget their purpose and giving up entirely becomes more inviting than before.Granted it could scare people off but to call it artificial difficulty for a mere psychological factor present in players who cant Git Gud makes no sense. Also you dont face the penalty when summoned as a phantom in Dark Souls . What gave you the impression that it does? If anything this motivates players to help each other as it even brings them back to human form if they help a host as a white phantom. It also completely refills your Estus so if youre halfway through a level and youre out of Estus you can take a break from the level place your summon sign help a host defeat the boss then come back to the same place you were at with all the enemies youve killed remaining dead as well as having full Estus.And lets not forget the fact that Dark Souls  has a lot of branching paths from the getgo. Dark Souls  on the other is very linear for most of the first half of the game and does not give you much options for where you want to go next. As such if one area is stuffing your asshole with your own boots from your own amputated legs you have the choice to go to other areas in Dark Souls  a choice that is missing from Dark Souls .One last thing I should mention is the Life Gems. People criticised Life Gems for making the game too easy while criticising multipleenemy encounters and the healthloss mechanic as making the game too difficult but why didnt they bother to add one to the other and see what could happen? Basically what Im saying is that Dark Souls  doesnt focus much on Estus as other Souls games because in it youre focusing on inflicting damage while healing it. Its not very similar to Bloodbornes rally system but it still worked. In Dark Souls  the focus was on multiple encounters with few enemies perfecting your style in dealing with these enemies to keep a good amount of Estus for the boss battle. But Dark Souls  gets unfairly judged based on how Dark Souls  did things while in reality Dark Souls  doing things differently doesnt mean its doing it badly. Different  Bad. It had focus on individual encounters and how players deal with them by using some slow healing items with them as well as dealing with multiple enemies. This is why I believe Dark Souls  is good in its own way. Theres a video I posted in my comment on this post to OP which explains that in more detail but keep in mind that the poster of the video talks about his own fighting style and many other playstyles can be just as viable when you find a place within them for Life Gems same thing with Estus in Dark Souls  and Blood Vials in Bloodborne. Dark Souls  on the other hand did not have an identity on its own I personally like all Souls games equally but Dark Souls  didnt really differ from other souls games it just felt like an amalgamation. It even has some of Dark Souls s blood in it with its many multipleenemy encounters. But I guess instead of incorperating an infite healing system like Life Gems it rather has a faster gameplay comparable to Bloodborne in terms of speed as well as several alternstive healing methods like slow regeneration and such. It also has the freedom during lockons that Dark Souls  introduced as well as various other mechanics which emphasised dealing with multiple enemies quickly like guard break ripostes and free aiming during lockons for great weapons.EDIT Holy shit this comment got long way too quickly.,DarkSouls2,d3qy9gc,3,t5_2vqni

8157995,0,t3_4qzw2r,Thats exactly how it was for me. I actually played DS first then  a few months later and ended up liking it marginally less only to learn that most of the community hates the game.On the weapon progression thing thats something I too felt. The only reason I juggled weapons so much in the first game was that it was very stingy with strength based weapons that werent giant yet showered the player with dex weapons. Even basic weapons like the broadsword put in work during my playthrough of . As for the scenery I think both games had their ups and downs but no location in DS was as painfully bland and unengaging as Undead BurgParish...The effigies were basically the stones from Demons Souls. I did like that humanity increased your defense and item discovery and healed you but having to trudge back to a bonfire every time I wanted to go human again was a drag.I dont really know what to say about the bosses. On my first solo DS playthrough the only boss to give me trouble was  Kings. Everything else including the ohsoooohard Ornstein and Smough went down on the first attempt and on subsequent playthroughs have been total nonthreats. With  I felt like most of them had a fair amount of challenge. Despite the overuse of armored humanoid bosses they felt different enough for me and to this day I still get stuck on the Old Iron King sometimes... but the DLCs did improve in that area Id say mostly stares at dual tigers ,DarkSouls2,d4xaq2z,1,t5_2vqni

8184752,0,t1_d50jl9p,I love the level design the music and bossfightsonly bloodborne have better bossfights and i like the gamein general its just that it got too hyped proclaimed as a sum of all that is good of the previous Soulsborne titles. But after playing it through a couple of times you start to see the cracks. Its a good game its just that weve been spoiled by the previous titles. Also the fanservice...These adjustments would seriously change the game meaning that every enemy would have to be changed as well. The only way i see the happening is if with get a SotFSedition of DSYes i give it alot of flack but most of my comments are repeat such as when people ask why i think its mechanically broken. And as every Soulsborne have things it does right and things it done wrong. And im sad to say that the two big wrong in DS are the things closest to my heart when it comes to the Soulsborne titles namely Lore  which i feel have been either overexplained with even text that is repeating what an other item said or a lorevoid where almost nothing is said. The best example is The Profane Captiol that suffers from both. PvP  a.k.a. the longevity of the game and with nothing new in NG PvP would be all that kept me playing. Ive already said everything i need to say on this matter.Edit No need to talk about the good things there are many who only does that so i upvote with what they write instead of writing myself. Thats why theres a majority of negativity in my comments toward DS so issuse with the game can come to light and thous might get fixed one day if enough people realize the problem.,DarkSouls2,d50n7s0,2,t5_2vqni

Despite the fact that individual stories dont seem to tie up together in a wider narrative arc I particularly enjoyed the stories of some minor bosses such as Mytha and Covetous Demon. The areas also can inspire a lot of ideas if you keep an open mind and think about whats happening there Cove Tseldora and Lost Bastille are favourites. The NPCs are slightly less interesting than in Ds but each of them has a unique view of the world which helps in understanding it compare Rosabeths and the sorcery trainers dialogues for instance.

8302441,0,t1_d5f60g3,For PvP the main thing is to have a variety. Say you are sticking to just magic and nothing hexmiraclepyromancy related you might want a variety to keep the opponent guessing like soul greatsword homing crystal soulmass crystal soul spear soul vortex etc.Playing mind games with your opponent to get them to mess up and eat a crystal soul spear to the face is one of the best ways to win as a caster in my opinion. Personally I like to also have a melee weapon to poke with just to make them keep their distance. Most fun I had in PvP oddly enough was a magic exchange with another caster and I only won because I didnt run out of spells I made the difficult journey as a caster to kill the Fume Knight for that awesome spell regen crown.For PvE most effective thing I have found for bosses is to just keep using an ascetic on the bonfire in Tseldora to respawn The Dukes Dear Freja and get as many casts of Crystal Soul Spear as you can slot. At this point my caster is overleveled and has  int  fth and  att but slotting CSS  times and using my remaining  single slots for spells like Dark Orb and repairfall control with the Crown of the Old Iron King equipped is more than enough to take me through anything in the base game most enemies never even get close enough to damage my miniscule health bar Though I use a ring slot for the ring of the embedded to give a fairly significant increase to my low hpstaminaequip load.,DarkSouls2,d5fd2qo,1,t5_2vqni

8325692,0,t3_4tlqeu,Get to SL before PvPing in the arena since the matchmaking there is  levels or if the arena cant find someone in that range it pairs you with anyone. SL is the most active tier so you should find more evenly matched fights there.Useful PvP chime spells are Replenishment for most fights Great Magic Barrier if your opponent looks like they cast a lot of spells Sunlight Blade or Resonant Weapon to up your damage doesnt matter which buff you use really Heavenly Thunder which is good to cast after a backstabriposte Scraps of Life which is generally a bit more useful than Heavenly Thunder and Resonant SoulGreat Resonant Soul to cast as your opponent rolls away in terror. Blinding Bolt is useful for inducing panic rolls but has pretty high stat requirements.As for stat allocation I dont know what weapons you want to use but you can actually use almost anything effectively in PvP once you get used to it. If youre doing a FTH build you probably dont need extra STR beyond the minimum requirements especially if you infuse your weapon. The only exception would be something like an uninfused Mace where you would want  STR. Getting  FTH will let you use the Dragon Chime which is one of the best in the game but if your damage is instead coming from Chime Hexes you would want a Chime of Want. If youre not going to use any offensive miracles or chime hexes then just stick with Clerics Sacred Chime since its fast and uses little stamina.Armor is generally not very important unless you really know what youre doing visavis resistances and poise. So just wear something light with good elemental defense like the Saints Set or something that you happen to think looks cool but isnt taking you over  Equip Burden with only  VIT. VGR and at least  END is mandatory for PvP. Less of either puts you at a great disadvantage. More VGR doesnt really help but you can get more HP by equipping Life Ring or Third Dragon Ring. More Stamina is always helpful.VIT is a dump stat which you really shouldnt invest a lot of levels in unless as I said earlier you know the intricacies of poise mechanics. Having high ATT is important for any caster since it bumps up Agility for dodging casting speed so you can actually cast spells in the middle of combat without being backstabbed and extra attunement slots. You might also want to up ADP to get some more iframes but I wouldnt bother getting over  agility.Getting INT up a bit will increase your Magic Fire and Dark resistances and also give you access to some chime hexes which are generally better for combat than miracles.  INTFTH is the softcap for elemental defense and reduces damage from all elements by .And this explains the hitboxes in PvP  Once you understand this you will start doing a lot better.,DarkSouls2,d5i9lp2,3,t5_2vqni

8483437,0,t3_4vwaox,a. You can enter NG from the Majula bonfire after killing the final boss. This restarts your game increasing each Bonfires level by one. Bonfire ascetics only increase that specific bonfires level by one. Bonfire level determines how difficult the area after the bonfire is and whether or not to spawn some specific unique items and enemies. Ascetics will also respawn all enemies and bosses in their section. b. Each character has its own completely separate game with its own difficulty levels. Each new game starts off at the same difficulty level only changing when you enter NG or use an ascetic on that character. Your second file will be just as difficult as your first was. . There are a few NPC invaders that dont rely on an online connection but you will not be able to invadebe invadedcoop until you get Gold. You can still join the covenants but many of them wont have much effect without online play.,DarkSouls2,d61z3u2,6,t5_2vqni

8569576,0,t3_4x5vh5,You dont really. Its part of the difficulty system. Fights will simply take longer. I cant recall in which NG cycle the game stops adding new  enemies and just increases hpdefensesdamage of enemies but its fairly boring to play after that. Once you figured out how to beat a boss pretty much perfect it wont change much if he just gets a bit stronger the next cycle.Armor loses lots of value in NG already except for elemental defense and poise. You can consider if it is worth to have  points in vit to wear a heavy set or be lightweight with flynns ring and put those stats elsewhere. Getting a good shield your agility up to  will increase your surviveability a lot.Once your stats for strdexintfth all hit the softcaps you can just get different elemental weapons or the same weapon with different infusions. Select the weapon according to the weakness of the boss youre going to fight and use the corresponding buff. Spells that buff you also help a lot such as great magic barrier or sacred oath.Edit What I forgot is that the most important factor for dps is actually how you play. Just look at how efficient speedrunners beat bosses vs people who play the game more casual. If you know the boss in and out as well as your weapon you will naturally kill the boss way quicker than you would with just a stronger weapon which you dont really know. ,DarkSouls2,d6cs0u1,3,t5_2vqni

9056991,0,t3_54b7r9,Since Pyromancies scale off of BOTH intfth added together you can actually make a pyrofaith hybrid. Just level Faith and add pyromancies!If youre using a rapier I highly recommend Stone Ring and Ring of Blades. Everything else is optional. A good shield may help.If you want a good Strength weapon options include the Great Club pancake Greatsword classic and the Mace simple and efficient. Anything with a B scaling in STR is likely fine.Pyromancy and miracles are best used as ranged supplements to a melee weapon in PvE IMO. Pyromancy Great Fireball Miracle Lightning SpearGreat Lightning Spear are likely all youd need offensively. Sacred Oath is good though acquired very late. I like to use a weapon buff as well Sunlight Blade is better than Flame Weapon. Keep a heal miracle or two maybe Warmth pyromancy.Any build that includes spells can benefit from Hexers Hood and Clear Bluestone Ring  is easily acquired.Use Mugenmonkey to plan out your build.

You wont find many good uses for spells on an SL character but Yearn is nearly always extremely useful. Youll want to go minweight against something like Elana and spam brightbug  lightning resin boosted dagger hits. The belfry gargoyles block access to the Gold Serpent Ring  which is pretty helpful on an SL character and theyre absolutely awful on New Game Plus. A buffed rapier works well.

9166672,0,t1_d8dx1sp,I will preface this comment by saying that DS SOTFS for Ps is technically my first souls game inasmuch as I bought it two weeks before I got Bloodborne which consumed my life until I platinumd it  weeks later.My first character a cleritard that i took to  and used a craftsman hammer or something with barely any miracles  points into ADP and  a  reduction shield managed to bang his head straight through the game. I did happen to clear out all the enemies in the first two areas on purpose by the end just started grinding mobs till i got the hang of the game. Then i cruised through until right around Brightstone Cove and managed to kill Last Sinner old iron king and The Rotten. Right about this point is where I got Bloodborne.  After finishing that game I came back and nearly finished DS with my cleric. I had the last section with the final boss left Vendrick and the last bosses of the DLCs left to complete when i restarted with the character Im playing now.VendrickLamar my new character does have  AGI and does move around alot better but the lag in the battle system is still so pronounced to me compared to BB and .  I think my preference mostly has to do with me cutting my teeth on Bloodborne. Poise has also never been something I missed because I never used it.  I do love super heavies in BB and to an extent in III too although ive yet to do a dedicated run its more about timing and spacing and not about tanking little hits which I dont really mind.,DarkSouls2,d8dxy3p,0,t5_2vqni

Im not certain where exactly it should be placed but placing it at the bottom is nonsensical. HcsmCss   without great combustion is strong enough by itself to beat a lot of weapons. Dont get me wrong pure casters may lose harder to top tier more than most mid tier builds i havent really tested it that much but that does make sense in concept. Just i note i dont know what HA stands for so i cant really respond to that. also your last sentence makes  sense great combustion is part of casting so saying a spell should be mid tier but spells should be bottom tier doesnt make much sense.

9839765,0,t3_5g3hk0,This is my personal beef with DS but a lot of it had to do with the enemy placement in Scholar of the First Sin. DS was brutal but for the most part if you were on your toes you would be able to manage just fine. There were multiple times in DS SotFS where their solution for difficulty was throwing literally too many enemies at you and having them spawn out of nowhere without any good way to pull them. They were so stingy with the farming and drops too so good luck upgrading past the difficulty. There was also just a general character to DS that I appreciated more. Overall I just felt like I was rewarded for my work in DS. DS just felt like a middle finger for a good portion of it. ,DarkSouls2,daq57p8,2,t5_2vqni

9878890,0,t3_5gufsz,So there are separate stats for hpvigor staminaendurance and equip loadvitality. Every level no matter the stat you go up raises your HP and not your general defense but the vigor stat does raise your HP faster.Some stats raise different types of defense.Attunement raises your slots and cast speed so as to no more for speed casters.You can only level up at the main up THROUGH AN NPC so dont kill her. She is by the Majula bonfire and is called the Emrald HeraldYou start with one estus and must collect estus shards to get more. Sublime Bone Dust upgrades their potency. The max is  estus. There are items called lifegems but they are completely consumable and must be collected. All HP regeneration items work much slower.Equipment breaks a lot faster but if isnt completely broken it can be replenished at a bonfire. Repair powder is a must if you plan to spend a lot of time away from a bonfire.Many shops have limited stock but late game shops have some supplies infinitely like pine resins arrows titanite shards etc.Enemies spawn only  times. Some only once like some in the first game. There are only a couple places where the enemies dont stop.Bonfire Astecics can be burned at a bonfire to put an area around the bonfire into NG difficulty respawn enemies respawn some items. Also can respawn bosses. THIS MAKES EVERYTHING HARDER so only do it if you are up for a challenge.Pyromancy is not something you start out with. You must find the Pyromancers Hand. Luckily it comes with Fireball.You can increase your invincibility frames for rolling and back stepping by upgrading Attunement and Adaption I think that is what that stat is called.Timing for parrying is much different. You need to project more. Riposte is more difficult but if you wait for the enemy to fall to the ground after a parry you can do a lot of damage.SO MANY MORE TRAPS.You get to equip  rings and  weapons in each hand as well as  different consumables.Instead of different colored titanites there are different stones. You bring them and your weapon to McDuff a blacksmith in Lost Bastille. He charges souls and stones to infuse your items. Not too much different than the first game but it is notable.I may post more differences when I can come up with more. I can only remember so much because I played both of these games through back to back.Edit Clarityone more thing too. Feel free to ask questions.You dont have to switch ammo with a button while using a bow. The left trigger and bumper or L L are used to aim. Right Bumper and trigger R R are used to fire BOTH arrow types you have equipped ex R for poison R for lightning.what uGanon said about health and hollowing.

9943369,0,t1_db2h6m1,On a related note and as a fairly new player  what playstyle do you use with a greatsword or Axe..or Club..  any heavy weapon?  I have only played with a light dextrous build where I sidestep attacks and moveroll in for a few strikes...then roll out to repeat.  I started a new character to try a STR build.  Chose Warrior.  Bought a Mace and went through Forest.  It worked well enough.  I mean most enemies got crushed  and if I parried it was lights out.   Very fun to step up with an L and watch my avatar John Henry the poor soul to oblivion.  But some enemies like the shield and spear undead I have trouble with.  When they are guarding the mace does almost no damage to them.  They sometimes do a dumb shield bash that I can step away from and then pulverize them.  That one is ok.  When they do their triple? spear thrust attack I try to block default warrior shield.  Iron Parma? but I get knocked back somewhere in there.  If I back offroll away they are defending again before I get close enough again.My assumption at this point is that I need to find a better shield block those piercing attacks and then step up and crush them.  My assumption is also that a STR weapon build means tanky armorblocking instead of dodgingmovement style combat.  ,DarkSouls2,db3n8ij,1,t5_2vqni

However upgrading the offhand will not increase the damage done by the main hand and viceversa.Also when determining the moveset of the powerstance it will generally use the weapon on the highest tier as model of the moveset but there are exceptions.You can refer to the spreadsheet at  for more info about movesets.,DarkSouls2,db82r4k,2,t5_2vqni

10018974,0,t3_5j5504,Your weapons and shields have stats. If your shield doesnt have  on the furthest stat to the right when your viewing it in your inventory well it wont block very well. You also need to get your agility to . Adaptability and attunement raise agility. You need around  adp on its own to get this high agility but after you get it your rolls are much more effective. Also take your time and try to lure enemies to you one at a time. Especially later in the dlcs. Running blind into situations is a good way to get ganked. Weapons like the bow are perfect for luring enemies. Even if you dont want to out the stat investment into dex Id still recommend using a bow of some sort with regular arrows and poison arrows. Many enemies can be poisoned and it is very effective. You can also just pop one at a distance with a normal arrow and let him come to you. Id suggest mastering parry. The buckler shield you find in the forest of fallen giants is perfect for learning to parry. The equipment and rings you wear also make a big difference. A big part of this game is stamina maintenance. The lower your equipment load the further you roll and the faster your stamina will regenerate. So unless you have high vit Id stick to light gear. At least until you get some good rings. Its a bit clunky at first but once you get to playing and level up to a decent level it will quickly become a favorite. One of the first things I do is meet my preferred weapons minimum requirements then instnarly focus on getting my agility to at least . From there I level everything else. ,DarkSouls2,dbdi199,4,t5_2vqni

10157906,1,t3_5letfw,DS has far better level design though and its consistent across all the different regions. Theres a far higher geographical awareness since everything connects so well. DS has sparing moments where the level design impresses you but those moments are rare. The game overall is inconsistent and most importantly has zero sense of atmosphere. You feel like youre just going through levels rather than moving through a living world like DS Sotfs fixes some things but the biggest most glaring flaws are still present and will never go away. ,DarkSouls2,dbvge9j,-3,t5_2vqni

It was known that linking the flame doesnt actually cure the curse whatsoever. It just prolongs the age of fire until the flame dies out again in which the cycle would repeat. That means more chaos drama false promises talking cats etc. It would be better to let the fire dark and bring the age of darkness for humans an age where man rules the world.,DarkSouls2,dbwu0ns,3,t5_2vqni

This would prevent armies of Undead from swarming into Drangleic.  However Nashandra does want a few Undead to come into Drangleic to open the way to the Throne so she left a portal through which a few Undead could travel.Alternately it has something to do with Nito.  We see Brightbugs which are said to be fragments of Nito surrounding the portal at the beginning and we hear a clip of the Milfanito song just before the portal appears.  Plus skulls come out.  Lots of Nitoish imagery here but I dont know why Nito would have anything to do with this so...,DarkSouls2,dbzhi35,7,t5_2vqni

Also you have to quickly slam the stick in that direction. Additionally you can press the joystick slightly before pressing RB. Also if you have low Agility which can be increased by leveling Adaptability stat among other things then you might have to wait a fraction of a second after you stop moving before your character is done recovering otherwise youll do a standard attack.

I often use warped sword or rust red scimitar and that either takes them out in one stamina bar or its very close.The key is to move fast dont let them gank you.

10852156,0,t3_5v59m4,spell buffs give a bonus according to your total base damage. So they are more effective on infused weapons thanks to the  boost in base damage you get. They do not care very much which particular element you infuse with a magic infused weapon buffed with SB will get about the same bonus as a lightning infused buffed with SB. Actually lost sinner infuses and buffs the best out of the UGSs. Its just got a vertical moveset like Fume UGS and PUGS. The hr of the greatsword is really good. Zwei is really good too because its much lighter and keeps its sweeping moveset of  handed use. If you have  str dont infuse the GS. Just leave it as is and enjoy your  str scaling bonus! You are getting . bonus damage. You can boost that by  with the rob. Thats really really good pure physical AR. No buffs needed. Physical resistance is low in this game compared to elemental resistance so stick with that! I dont suggest taking stats in fth or int just for the sake of spell buffs. Just use resins. If you want to do a spell sword wait until you have vigor at  and stamina at like  or so before proceeding to casting stats. If you want to do a low level or SL spell sword you have way too much str.Also your adaptability is quite low. Bring it up to about  ASAP. And as a final note I am assuming this is for PvE. If you want PvP the advice changes a lot. ,DarkSouls2,ddzbn0l,3,t5_2vqni

You can even read articles in reputed sites saying how it is a genius masterwork and similar.Obviously Dark Souls  left some things open and vague but it told a story nonetheless. For me Dark Souls  is actually a patchwork of different narratives fallen kingdoms different places different ages because the center of it Emerald Herald the protagonist Majula Aldia the mechanics of the fire and humanity themselves is void. It is a missing piece an essential piece that the game left unexplained and this is why people like VaatiVidya try to speculate it saying that Gwyn weaved humanity into the fire that the soul vessel is broken in Aldia backyard or that EH is your queen just like Nashandra was of Vendrick. Because otherwise a lot of things doesnt make sense and the game becomes a patchwork rather than a whole.With SOTFS I thought devs were going to be brave and create a real ending but what we have is nothing it doesnt tie anything.,DarkSouls2,defzxme,1,t5_2vqni

11042222,0,t3_5xna8o,I have used sorcerers very extensively in both PvE and PvP. I finished the entire game and DLCs several times and ranked in BoB. There is some good stuff here but let me point out a few things that might help. . The magic mace is holding you back. The only advantage of hammers is strike damage which infusion reduces significantly. Otherwise they are slow have poor range and have questionable movesets. The mace in particular is a good scaling weapon and doesnt infuse well. The only hammer that infuses ok is the blacksmith hammer from lenningrast. . look for good min spec weapons. That is those with high base damage and less or no scaling. Here are some of my favorites longsword foot soldier sword winged spear black scorpion stinger its really really good BMGS rapier red rust scimitar and the old knight pike. If you can manage to farm them up the varangian sword and the black dragon sword are also both great min spec weapons. But good luck getting them to drop. . Be prepared to manage durability! Its the only balance point on some weapons because they have such high damage for so little stat cost. . The MLGS is overrated. Its OK but nothing special. You can get decent pure physical if you infuse it with a magic stone but it kills the laser and gets you mediocre damage for a greatsword. Youd be better off saving some stats and  handing a raw BMGS. If you are into greatswords youd probably be better off with watchers. . Infused weapons work fine in the DLC in NG. Full upgrade all weapons wear the stone ring avoid the worst elemental resistances and frequently buff and you will be surprised how easily the mob enemies go down. I recall using a buffed longswords rhr a lot. . Dont worry about crossbuffing. Using GMW or CMW on any elemental infusion gets almost an identical bonus.. dont worry about infusing with an element you dont have scaling for. Lightning is fine if you need to avoid resistances. The elemental scaling after infusion is really weak anyway and the difference will be small. . going into NG and beyond gets tricky for a  sorcerer. Elemental resistance goes through the roof and the game practically shoehorns everyone into pure physical high poise damage weapons. And weapon degradation increases significantly. Its tough without  in str or dex. ,DarkSouls2,dejm7bf,2,t5_2vqni

11307967,0,t3_61au01,STRoriented quality builds happen to be my favorite builds well I put a dash of miracles in there for PvE but I am by no means an expert especially when it comes to PvP.STR is a really cool stat. Obviously it increases your damage with the right weapons but it also lets you get extra defenses out of armor and most shields. So if you want to go STR medium armor and a medium shield will be very beneficial in both PvE where I reside and PvP. That said I tend to either two hand my weapons or powerstance and rely on rolling in either light or medium armor. Shields just arent my thing. STR is what to aim for then either  or  DEX depending on what types of weapons you want to wield. Im not too familiar with DS but this has been the standard since DeS actually it was a  split then because of two handed rules so I doubt they really changed anything drastically in DSIII.Claymore is nice especially one handed the Bastard Sword tends to be better twohanded due to its lighter weight deals a tiny bit less damage though and the immense distance you can cover with the rolling h attack is amazing in PvP or when facing mobs in PvE roll past your target away from enemies approaching you from behind then catch them all with the end of that rolling attack. Has saved me more times than Id care to admit. It has what I call the heavy greatsword moveset while the claymore has the standard greatsword moveset which is a little less hefty and includes some nice thrusts. The heavy moveset swaps out the standard movesets thrusts for pancakes in a general sense.Another BA greatsword is the Mastodon. Its heavy AF and uses the heavy greatsword moveset but it deals ALL THE DAMAGE.the Sunsword is only worth it if youre going for that  pure martial build and even then it can be challenging to obtain.If youre looking at the smaller quality weapons such as straightswords the longsword will get you pretty far. Nice suite of slashes and thrusts fast attack set overall solid reach. Later in the game the durability is actually what gets you since it can require quite a few swings to down a larger enemy.One answer to this problem is powerstancing which is absolutly phemominal with a quality build. A longsword or any straightsword in the right hand gives you the lighter straightsword attacks while a greatsword such as the bastard sword which is very light weight in the off hand changes the powerstanced attacks to the heavier more damaging greatsword moveset. Its an epic blend of thrusts slashes and pancakes and you really have to use it to truly understand it especially since DSIII doesnt have that type of dualwielding I thinkA lighter version of this is with a longsword and estoc. And just a quick note the Estoc is a superb quality weapon and the go to fast weapon for strquality builds. With this set up the longsword is the heavier slower weapon so that goes in the offhand and the faster Estoc with its longrange jab seriously that thing outranges some spears in the main hand.,DarkSouls2,dfdqoqb,1,t5_2vqni

11350257,0,t3_61zbg6,Powerstancing compatible weapons gives a dual wielding moveset. The R and R generally remain the same as your main hand weapon is normally but L and L become a new moveset that uses both weapons at the same time. If youve played DS think of  handing the gotthard twinswords drank hammers drank twinspears etc. The weapons have to be compatible with each other but it still gives a lot more options for weapon combinations than having a couple of fixed dual wield weapons. ,DarkSouls2,dfij49r,6,t5_2vqni

Try to get them done quickly. Sometimes you can get them stuck in an endless pattern when... The Mage will eventually shriek just because. This is when you retreat back up the hill. Most of the bird assholes should only charge one at a time.  In the last bridge area snipe the first guy. Snipe the Mage. Try to hold an arrow until he stops moving  bends down to do poison gas or shriek THEN shoot. Purge the rest of the ones across the way. You can then make the skelly dogs jump to their death if you shoot them once with the bow and arrow. Lastly where the Mage stood stand there and look across the way. Snipe that red eyed ass.Boom!

11610712,0,t1_dgc2hxo,Hey thanks for the comment. I understand what you are saying. I tried being as fair as I could. The main reason Dark Souls  bosses got a lower rating was not because of their comparison to other bosses in the series but actually because of the factors in place. The bosses visuals are not that impressive for most of them and the mechanics for the fights themselves are also weak. Obviously that there are exceptions and some of them are quite good especially the ones on the DLCs. I appreciate the criticism though.,DarkSouls2,dgc31qb,-2,t5_2vqni
11613169,0,t1_dgbtqu8,A lot of the new NPC invaders were obnoxious as was the decision to make the already obnoxious Iron Keep obnoxiouser. Aside from that though I totally agree  SotFS is absolutely the definitive version of DS and there is absolutely no reason to go back to vanilla.,DarkSouls2,dgcd2c3,3,t5_2vqni

11674693,1,t1_dgii0j7,I find more and more people are agreeing with this nowadays. DS had the best mechanics most interesting weapons and the best PvP this series has ever seen. Add in the bonfire ascetics and changing NG cycles that DS is lacking I think DS will be remembered as on of the better games in the series. I would kill for a DS SotFS remaster. The only negative I can think of for DS right now is the lack of scabbards.,DarkSouls2,dgjccis,2,t5_2vqni
