5452767,0,t3_3pfw3x,the  is exactly the one I bought yesterday. Awesome shoe.And it suits perfectly your needs I believe which are also mine. I mainly got them as a winter shoe from now on I live in a quite cold countryBTW I wear us in Nikes and I had to get a US.. I strongly suggest you to go somewhere to try them first so that you can pick your right size. ,RedWingShoes,cw8n5wl,1,t5_346di
9668046,0,t1_da4qoql,Definitely D. The .D will really fit like a D in most other shoes. Im a D and I wear an D in all of my rangers and similar fitting heritage including the blacksmiths. Most people go half a size down but if youre foot is a little wide usually you just take the same length in a regular width. P.S. Black Friday from am to pm the entire store is  off. I know its only  hours but youll save about  on that shoe. Good luck!,RedWingShoes,da4sf29,4,t5_346di
10316360,0,t3_5nlf1x,You just wear them. Thats it really they will break in with use. Thick socks help. Youre also piling them a little much. The opinion of myself and many others is to use Lexol condition every one in a while when the shoes need it. For me this is probably every  weeks if that. I live in the northeast but only wear mine about  times a week. ,RedWingShoes,dcdeyqd,1,t5_346di

11726181,0,t1_dgp61u4,Most people feet are a different size. My right one is bigger than my left thats why you always have to fit for the biggest one especially with red wing because they are pretty damn narrow.,RedWingShoes,dgp6yl7,2,t5_346di
