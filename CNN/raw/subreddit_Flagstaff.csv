305271,0,t1_cfcc21k,I pay    utilities it is winter so this will drop when it warms up for my bedroom apartment in Southside. Its tiny maybe  square feet but its cheap and very close to campus. Deals can be found but you will have to compromise with either a tiny apartment or something out on the East side. Also you gotta get lucky.I found my apartment by posting an ad apartment wanted on craigslist and bumping it once or twice. Just as I was giving up and surrendering to the idea of living on the east side my landlord got in touch with me before the unit was even officially put on the market. Bam. Could not turn it down as downtown units will literally be snatched up within hours.,Flagstaff,cfcepwx,3,t5_2qygf

611281,0,t3_215b4x,Welcome. I would recommend dinner at Tinderbox. Drinks at Rendezvous. I assume you have a rental car so drive to the Canyon once there use the busses to get around. Try and aim for sunset if you can and then have dinner and drinks at El Tovar. My girlfriend is from Scotland she loved going to Westfork down in Sedona. Bring dry clothing for after if you go though as you will be in the creek a few times. Lastly have brunch at Criollo. Enjoy your stay. Edit If you want live music pick up a Flagstaff Live at almost any local store to see whats going on or hit  ,Flagstaff,cg9r6sb,4,t5_2qygf

1455676,0,t3_2at9jp,Dont know a lot about jobs a lot of retail to be sure. As far as office jobs look into the university WLGore purina as theyre some of the main employers. Weather is pretty mild compared to other parts of the country. Summers are a tad warm but really nice. Autumn is really wonderful and lasts through late November. When its not snowing the winter is pretty reasonable. Just get a nice coat and youre set. Otherwise Flagstaff is a fantastic little town with a good amount of big city amenities. All the activity is in a small area of downtown so walking and biking are big. Quite a bit of outdoorsy things to do. Great hiking mountain biking cycling fishing camping. Coming from so cal youll be paying a lot less for rent probably  less. Food costs nearly as much though. I just moved the opposite way and LA rent still astounds. ,Flagstaff,ciyqsz0,3,t5_2qygf
1463129,0,t3_2at9jp,So I will preface this by saying I have lived here most of my life in some ways that is good in others not so much.. From what I have seen and experienced Flagstaffs job market is poor. Now that could be due to the fact that I have come from to high demand job markets finance and healthcare. I should clarify that when I say poor I mean that the pay relative to anywhere else is generally less. I could increase my pay currently  simply by moving two hours south to Phoenix where the cost of living is also lower. You can find jobs but they probably wont pay what youre used to.. The weather here is consistent on a five to ten year cycle. We have all four seasons. In Flagstaff fall is certainly my favorite with cool temperatures and low wind. Very little moisture. Winters vacillate between dry less than  inches of snow to extremely wet we have been the most snowed upon city in the United States before. The trend is supposedly  wet seasons out of every  years though certainly not to the far extreme either way. Spring is windy and cool. Sometimes its horrible. Most of the time bearable though you wont be playing much golf in spring. Summers are great especially July to September when the Monsoon rains show up.. As far a music scene goes ours isnt terrible for a small place. We have had some big names come through and we get a lot of bands right before they make it big Ive seen some awesome bands come through early in their careers. We have a pretty vibrant underground music scene as well that generally consists of house shows  dont know what kind of music youre into. I love it here and am happy to call it my home without a doubt there are places with more to do urbanwise but you will not find a place with better outdoor access  I have snowboarded and mountain biked in the same day!. Hope this helpsTLDR Flagstaff is erratic by any measure.,Flagstaff,cizogfv,2,t5_2qygf
1985550,0,t3_2hfjxf,Used to live in Doney Park.  Yes avoid the rodents!  Also Hanta virus is big up on the Rez. Avoid rodent droppings.  If you take the road down to Prescott from Ash Fork youll pass by an area of prairie dog colonies on the west side of the road. Its surrounded by barbed wire and biohazard signs all around.

5428267,0,t3_3p1ija,For a small city I think the system rocks.  Compared to other cities the city routes dont make me want to rip my hair out and are pretty easy to navigate and run on time regularly.   Someone else mentioned the free pass thats handed out to full time employees of the university if you end up working for NAU... if not a year pass is fairly cheap semester I believe. There are the on campus buses too.  Campus is easy to walk and bike around so its not an absolute necessity that you ride these ones unless you want to.  I drive buses for the university and they do get packed on occasion namely between classes but still a good system two routes that run every  minutes people always complain about the campus buses and how theyre always busy and late which really isnt the case. ,Flagstaff,cw5ima1,1,t5_2qygf

6836435,0,t3_49eahw,You will definitely be fine on that salary more than likely. Parents make about k a year combined with six kids at home they do pretty alright. Cline library is probably the quietest aside from the downtown library. Clinr is on NAU campus right behind Chik Fil A off of Milton. I dont feel like paying for parking there so I usually park at Michaels and do the five minute walk but parking is free after . After pm however you need a student ID to get in the building. But as long as you get in before that youre fine. For coffee shops Firecreek is great so is Late for the Train. Flagstaff has a lot of really chill local places especially downtown and theyre usually way better than a chain like Starbucks so definitely do some exploring  And welcome to Flagstaff!,Flagstaff,d0r7nbi,5,t5_2qygf
