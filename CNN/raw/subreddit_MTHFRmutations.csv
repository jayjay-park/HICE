6743378,0,t3_3vi0yt,MTHFR CT means your methylation pathway is functioning about  at best. The important B vitamins especially B cant get around the folate block. I have the same. The MTRRs mean you cant take the short cut around the cycle. The COMTs are also significant together with the the VDRTaq. BHMT is also important. Go to knowyourgenetics.com and plug in your SNPs for a free MPA and detailed descriptions. Download their free companion guideworkbook and the book Genetic Bypass... Using Nutrition to Bypass Genetic Mutations. Try not to be overwhelmed by the very complex molecular biology and long list of suggested supplements. Take the MPA to your doctor and work with himher on a program. Im sure hes probably heard of Dr. Yasko if he ordered these genetics specific to methylation.,MTHFRmutations,d0gtmdq,1,t5_2zpge
11768743,0,t3_6510lt,This sounds too suddenextreme for just a vitamin issue. Unless your supplementation triggered some kind of environmental epigenetic change highly unlikely I would also look into other causes.Some things to consider you dont have to answer hereHave you had your hormone levels checked in detail? Are you taking any other medicationssteroidsdrugsetc? Any other dietary changes? Any travel outside of the country?New sexual partners?Exposure to environmental toxinsradiationetc?I would go over these with an MD doctor or two before making any assumptions about it being caused by vitamins.If your main problems really are poor methylation and hair loss I would look into taking MethylB and Biotin orallysublingual skip the lotions. Make sure your B is PURE methylcobalalmin sp and not some combination of other forms Cyano Hydroxy etc. I dont know enough about Folate B to recommend one to you but Im sure someone else here could. Some people say to avoid Folic Acid as a source.Give it  weeks of consistent use before you freak out or stop taking them. Homeostasis and Allostasis take time to reach equilibrium.If the anxiety is too bad consider an antianxiolytic like LTheanine.I remember a Bvitamin deficiency was linked to rashes like Rosacea but I dont remember which one. Might want to Google that.I dont know anything about Neurobiologix specifically but I would always check to see if the person who recommended them has any financial affiliations. You can buy perfectly good basic supplements from Amazon from other brands if NBX is weirdsuspicious or too expensive. ,MTHFRmutations,dgu0niq,2,t5_2zpge
