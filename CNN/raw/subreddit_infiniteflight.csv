3203447,0,t1_cou1bcu,ampampamp Airfield traffic pattern sfw gtgtAn airfield traffic pattern is a standard path followed by aircraft when taking off or landing while maintaining visual contact with the airfield.gtAt an airport the pattern or circuit in the Commonwealth is a standard path for coordinating air traffic It differs from straightin approaches and direct climbouts in that aircraft using a traffic pattern remain close to the airport. Patterns are usually employed at small general aviation GA airfields and military airbases Many large controlled airports avoid the system unless there is GA activity as well as commercial flights. However some kind of a pattern may be used at airports in some cases such as when an aircraft is required to go around  but this kind of pattern at controlled airports may be very different in form shape and purpose to the standard traffic pattern as used at GA airports.gtThe use of a pattern at airfields is for air safety By using a consistent flight pattern pilots will know from where to expect other air traffic and be able to see it and avoid it. Pilots flying under Visual Flight Rules VFR may not be separated by air traffic control so this consistent predictable pattern is a vital way to keep things orderly. At towercontrolled airports air traffic control ATC may provide traffic advisories for VFR flights on a workload permitting basis.gtgtImage iInteresting Common traffic advisory frequency | Traffic pattern indicator | Skid aerodynamics Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcouc oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecouc.

3941513,0,t1_cr5j83q,No I dont think you can move on the fly unfortunately.  You are right sometimes I go on and find everyone is at the other side of the region with no one heading in my direction.  That usually involves a quick exit and trying to find a controller slot somewhere with more traffic.It is nice being busy  albeit for short periods.  You certainly need to concentrate when you have several aircraft incoming at once.  Having tried all positions so far I think Approach is one of the more difficult to do since you have to deal with aircraft coming from all directions at all speeds and all heights and somehow arrange them all at platform altitude for the ILS at a nice speed and good separation.  If there is no Centre controller as well you can be contolling aircraft from quite a way out.  It is satisfying when you have a nice line of aircraft arranged for the approach.,infiniteflight,cr5ke4m,1,t5_2z20p
