2010254,0,t3_2hru4d,Id recommend you separate the IO and the views from each other. Search in a database should have nothing to do with blueprints. If they are dependent on each other it would probably be best to put all the IO stuff in the same module. Then both blueprint A and B can depend on that.If you ever need a quick hack there is one trick you can use which is to put the import in the function itself eg.blueprinta.py    def foo        import blueprintb        blueprintb.bar,flask,ckvfl2t,3,t5_2s1s3

3334421,0,t1_cp8cfmv,What Im saying by persist is the computation which will be running persisting between the time the user makes their first request that triggers the computation and their last request where you display the results.If you want to lazy load it you have to respond immediately to the users first request with a page that has some HTMLJS that will reload the data.  This will also trigger the computation that will happen in the background.  How will you be doing this?  If its in a thread you can play with locking and have direct access to the results through shared memory if its in a subprocess you can play with IPC and move the data around via sockets you can put the results on the filesystem or you can put it in a database which is probably the easiest way to do it in my opinion.,flask,cp8clw4,1,t5_2s1s3

6008043,0,t1_cy6wpf7,The reason Flask would not have such a tutorial would be that you would need to use a nonflask library such as python boto to manage the s side of things. The flask work is pretty trivial tbh you need a route that accepts multipart data so POST PUT etc anything with a body which is part of the HTTP spec not flask or s specific. Once you have achieved this flask request can then get you any files attached to the request which you would use boto or similar python lib to send to Amazon S or compatible S service.See ,flask,cy76ozt,1,t5_2s1s3
