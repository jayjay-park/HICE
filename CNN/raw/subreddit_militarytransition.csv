10699451,0,t1_ddjk1y0,Was your last day in the military on September ? Or were you still classified active duty on October ? Because that could change your effective date. Since the effective date is always the first day of the next month. So if you were still considered active duty on October  your effective date would be November . Meaning only  month worth of back pay. Food for thought. As for the previous VSO I dont know. It depends on who he works for i.e. a state agency like me VFW DAV American Legion. If that VSO had you fill out a VA Form  and you havent submitted anything since that VSO could still represent you. I would contact that person to see if they can assist you. I mentioned before that I am tied into the VA system so I can look claims up for veterans I represent. I dont know about other agencies. We seem to be the only ones in our state capable of doing that. Who ever this VSO is you submitted the claim through may have a different procedure for checking on your claim. But if you have their contact information Id certainly try to contact them as it is usually quicker for me to cut through the red tape than it is for my vets. ,militarytransition,ddjkhl2,2,t5_3ixjn

But your post confirmed one of my suspicions about my management experience and how it will translate over to the civilian sector.  The project and program management experience I have might not translate as well as most would think.  Looks like its Walmart greeter for me!  Just kidding...,militarytransition,dewzg6e,2,t5_3ixjn
