You could have incredibly intricate systems but the average listener will gravitate towards what they enjoy the most not what is technically correct. I guess this is one of those things like fine wine studies show that humans cant tell the difference beyond a certain point yet wine connoisseurs can always tell the difference. It even talks about in the link I posted how people can notice a difference between speakers even when their really isnt a noticeable one in front of them. Let me be clear I am speaking about speakers only not the crossover network amplifier or cables which is why I think this story could have some credibility.

224460,0,t3_1wob3g,A good DAC can perfectly reconstruct a waveform from its samples.  The DAC does not actually produce staircase shaped waves it interpolates between the points.  Regardless of interpolation design any analog signal is continuous but I cant imagine any modern DAC ever being designed without nonlinear signal interpolation in mind.  Vinyl sounds different because the device is an analog electromechanical instrument.  Its a century old design and in general it can add a bit of color that happens to be pleasant because of design knowhow.  Just like the wood in an electric guitar adds to the sound despite actually distorting the sound.  It is possible to make a guitar whose wood makes the sound worse but no one does that.Also the whole ritual of setting up the record usually means people are listening to music without doing anything else.  If your record player and preamp and whatnot are nice you probably listen for a difference in clarity or warmth or whatever and whether or not you hear it youre listening more closely.  Listening closely enhances any listening experience unless youre hearing something wrong with your system or headphones.Modern DACs are superior to vinyl.  That is a fact.  But vinyl has its benefits and thats why I enjoy both.,audiophile,cf40f5z,24,t5_2qmiy

Once they see them they suddenly hear a lot of differences and express them in the lovely hifi speak we all know. Thats why I told you that you were experiencing bias it was not a judgment on your intelligence I actually think that the more intelligent you are the more susceptible to bias you are as well. So yes thats an unequivocal statement but substantiated.Of course you could say that the people who were tested were hearingimpaired and you can hear things they dont but I think this is not reasonable.Btw I too hear differences between amplifiers.

1014946,0,t3_25o9at,Youre on the right track using the arc protractor which will both correctly align the cantilever of the cartridge and set overhang automatically and is much more accurate than the twogrid method seen below.   Information on mounting distance for this particular turntable are scant but from my information a standard Technics mounting distance should be fine.  Effective length is .mm overhang of mm and a pivot to spindle distance of .mmSet the cartridge approximately midway in the mounting slots and just barely snug the mounting bolts leaving them loose enough to perform minor adjustments of the cartridge but not wobbling all over the place.  Tape the paper protractor to the slipmat.  Set the very tip of the needle yes the part that touches the groove down on the part of the arc closest to the inner label spot marked C and be sure it lands perfectly on the arc feeling free to move the platter so that you can hit the arc  a small folding x to x magnifier will be very helpful.  Tape down the platter and go to the arc near the leadin groove marked C and try to hit the arc there as well but now youll have to move your cartridge in the headshell slots to achieve this.  Go back and verify youre still hitting the arc near the leadout groove area.  Once you can hit the arc successfully at both points align the cart in the headshell using the grid area of the protractor to verify the cantilever is exactly parallel to the printed lines.  Go back and verify that you are still hitting the arc at the aforementioned leadinout areas and tighten your headshell screws carefully being certain not to move the cartridge while doing so.  Yes its a tedious procedure but extremely accurate.  Oh and throw that silly Shure thing away.,audiophile,chjnnam,1,t5_2qmiy

It certainly is one of the only ones Ive spent an entire day listening to without being fatigued from the sound signature or strained from the physical discomfort. For use at home I personally have never reached for my Momentums. If I had to pick a single budget headphone to live with the s would be it.Keep in mind that the  are open back and the Momentums are closed back so in theory that  should be better for gaming but would leak more sound than the Momentums.Its really your decision but my best advice is just do research and figure it out. Good luck man!,audiophile,chq3oqz,2,t5_2qmiy

1092111,0,t3_26lfs4,Ive been contemplating an amp to mate with my BampW  S speakers as I move over to a processor instead of a receiver. Ive narrowed it down to a few contenders but Im not really sure how equal these comparisons are. I can find strong praise for each.Amps Im considering Luxman M Luxman M Nakamichi PAPA IIThe M is in the  range but its the most monsterous of all these amps and is  watts in pure Class A operation or  watts in AB operation All  ohm rated. The M and PA are both cheaper at around . The M is rated at  watts as well assumably AB operation at  ohms. The PA is  watts at  ohms lowest powered of the lot not that power rating is important in my small listening area but most notably is a Nelson Pass design derived from the Thresholds which I know receive accolades from audiophiles.So all that said which of these should I go with? Ive heard it said that the Luxman amps provide a very luxurious sound thats so nice and pleasant with lots of musicality that other amplifiers simply lack. I also love the aesthetics of the Luxman gear But must admit I am also a fan of the hulk appearance of the PA as well and respect the Threshold pedigree greatly  I have a Stasis  which I enjoy which is also  wattschannel at  ohm though far heavier built than the PA.Really any comments here are appreciated. I was considering a Lexicon NT A rebadged Bryston B ST for  but have heard it said while well built and reliable that it lacks the same smoothness of a Luxman. Im incredibly indecisive right now bouncing between paying more for the M because of its immense build  lbs worth or being content with the smaller M which has those great meters or just waiting out for a a nice PA to show up and scoop it up for around . Size is a concern for my intended use though I will overlook this only for the M because of its overall quality and build.EDIT Ok remove the M from this consideration. So now my basic question Luxman M vs. Nakamichi PAPA II same price  which should I go for and why?,audiophile,chsfda8,2,t5_2qmiy

The idea that you dont want a sub to keep signal paths simple really makes no logical sense. Keeping signal paths simple doesnt really mean or do anything and not using a sub because it has a solid state amp really makes no sense.

1204010,0,t3_27ry4f,Hellolong story short my current amp is slowly dying on me therefore I want to replace it. . What is your budget?  I am planning to spend up to about  .  I live in Germany.An easy to reach local source would be saturn or amazon.de as well as alternateAll of them have products in my price range. For amazon the German search term is Verstrkeramp.. What are you looking for?  I am just looking for an amp that is able to live up to the rest of my audio equipment and will function reliably for as long as possible.Nothing fancy really.. What gear do you own?  My current setup consists of two Gale Model    ohm speakers powered by an ONKYO Quartz Synthesized Tuner Amplifier R.Power rating of the speakers is IIRC up to W. I cant find any information about them.Also a pair of beyerdynamic  DT  Pro ohm headphones.. What do you intend on using for a source?  The main audio source is an Asus Xonar U connected to my PC.I also have a Pioneer PDS CD deck that I use every once in a while.. What material will you be using your gear for?  Mostly for listening to music metal and classic lossless rip via PC but also for gaming and watching movies.The most important aspect is the music.. Are you willing to buy used?  Technically yes but there seems to be a sufficient range of new products in my price range.Still if I can get much better gear for the money when I buy it used I would be OK with that.Related question  The speakers have  separate input channels each presumably for separate bass and treble.In my current setup the cables of the speakers are spliced together at the end to form a single channel.  Is there a way I can take advantage of the separate channels with a normal amp?Most if not all amps that I have seen offer at least two outputs. Since I also want to replace the cables can I just connect bass to one output and treble to the respective other or would that cause problems?Do I have to look for a spliced cable or similar contraption to use the speakers properly? I have seen some with short cables connecting the inputs directly at the speaker.  Thank you in advance.Edit I am thinking about buying either the Yamaha AS  or the Yamaha AS. Both seem sufficient.

1543778,0,t3_2bvy6o,Dude. You are extremely lucky and fortunate. I am not the biggest fan of Nak but that system together is PHAT. Set up the Nakamichi system with the Klipsch speakers. Then try the JBLs for comparison. Althought the Klipschs are older  I imagine the Klipschs are better and will provide more satisfaction. Then set up the Audio Research SP with the D and the Altecs. Get rid of everything else. Maybe keep the turntable. All of the other stuff is good but redundant. Those two system combinations assuming everything works are guaranteed to please. The Philips speakers are quality too but the foam may have rotted. The Audio Research stuff has tubes in ittake it to a reputable high end store for calibration. Prepare to spend  bucks on getting everything up to snuff and for cables and speaker wire. Pay for it by selling the rest. The Carver amp is cool but you could use that to raise money. Or hook it up to your computer and be the envy of  of the computing public. I like the JBLs but those other speakers if working will be more satisfying provided you have the setup correct and the room is good. And you will get guaranteed  bucks for the JBLs. But...Collectors will pay good  for the Klipsch and Altecs no matter if working or not so keep that in mind. The Altecs should have the tweeter on topon big standstweeters at ear height. Also keep the MampK. If you live in NJ PA and or DE I would love to help set up. TLDR Keep  systems SYSTEM ONE NAK system and Klipsch speakers SYSTEM TWO Audio Research and ALTECS. Keep the Carver for your PC one turntable the MampK sub and the JBLs ONLY if the Klipsch or the Altecs do not work Sell the rest.   ,audiophile,cj9sbjc,1,t5_2qmiy

1558305,0,t1_cjbi7ws,I figured someone would mention this before I got the chance. Honestly whenever I listen to that album I always think about how it would be exponentially better if the bass was louder. Having a thick heavy low end on that album would make it so much heavier. The album is great as it is and sometimes you will be able to hear the bass coming through pretty well and it just teases you because you know it would sound SO badass. Theres a nice bass tone too its just such a damn shame that its so low in the mix. I wonder if it ever will be remastered with louder bass. I feel like Metallica has to be well aware of how many fans want to hear the bass on this album. If Metallica were to rerelease this album with audible bass then they would probably make an absolute killing as so many fans would immediately hop on it. I think it would totally change the dynamics of the album. Ranted a little bit but Ive always wondered how much the tone of the album would change with a nasty heavy low end. Oh well.,audiophile,cjblv1g,3,t5_2qmiy

1713841,0,t3_2e0ovy,Optical cable can transfer surround sound but only if the signal you send it has multiple channels. Almost all recorded music is mixed in two channels except DVDAudio and some SACD hence why only your front speakers are getting signal. You can get simulated surround sound by using a DSP effect on your receiver like Dolby Pro Logic II or all channel stereo but this doesnt really improve the music. Generally it makes it worse because the music was mixed and intended for playback in stereo. Additionally  because the aux cable is sending an analog signal to the receiver the receiver has to sample it digitally to apply the DSP then reconvert it back to analog degrading the signal further. The only time I can recommend not using direct mode for an analog source is if your front speakers dont handle deeper bass. In this case having the receiver sample the signal will allow bass frequencies to be sent to the subwoofer which is more important sonically than the degradation of the signal. Finally the .mm optical cables you see will transmit audio but only if the headphone jack has an optical transmitter generally higher end laptops and desktop sound cards have this but your iPhone does not. For your iPhone you are limited to the .mm jack or bluetooth if your receiver has bluetooth functionality. Keep in mind that bluetooth isnt that great for audio either.

2013646,0,t1_ckt30n1,Thanks for the reply. I guess Im not looking for specific parts but yes I see your point with the budget. The interesting part is I dont have a specific budget because I dont plan on buying everything in one big purchase. I have speakers on loan which I will use until I can afford my own that way I can save  or  or whatever seems reasonable. I need to start with an amp or receiver correct? The reason I assumed vintage receiver is bc a lot lot of sitespeople say thats the best introcheap way to do it. But due to the fact of it being an unpopular choice in this question of mine which I appreciate because that way I am being guided into what to buy I decided to do ebay and follow someones suggestion of a more modern receiver from a respectable name. I bought a used Marantz  for . I cant really complain. I am looking for a .. system just music. Now about feeding those digital files. I went with the more economically friendly receiver that doesnt support airplaywifietc. Up above I heard from airport express raspberry pi and apple TV. Is this really worth it? or just a pain in the ass to set up?And speakers. Sigh. I wouldnt even know where to begin with these.

2169740,0,t3_2jubxk,Ill comment Ive owned SRi SRe and SRis.What I have found is that unless you are going all the way to the SR range or higher the SRs will suffice. Between the SR and to the SR there just isnt enough improvement for it to be worth it. At the SR the sound and build quality take a noticeable increase that makes the money worth it.A large part of how your Grados will sound is in the cushions you use. They used to use their open donut pads in more of their lower lines but now they only reserve that for SR and up. Even a pair of SRs matched with these pads give you  of the sound quality of the SR at less then half the price. So unless you want to spend the money on the s just get a pair of sr or sr if you can find them on sale and then buy the better pads from Grado.Though like others have mentioned try auditioning them first. Grados are very lovehate. They have a small soundstage and are far from the most comfortable headphones. Though they are quite detailed and lively sounding especially for the price. Though make sure you have a good source and good recordings they can make any imperfections more noticeable. ,audiophile,clfmi2r,1,t5_2qmiy

2210036,0,t3_2ke6b8,You could try but unless they are really mediocre audio op amps like the LM its unlikely it will make a difference  it could even have unintended negative consequences.Op amps arent necessarily good or bad some just excel in certain areas. For example an op amp might have low distortion good while being unstable at high frequencies bad. The engineers who made your PC knew these characteristics and designed the circuit specifically for that op amp. If you switch to a different op amp theres no telling what the results could be. Most likely you would not hear a big difference. Nevertheless it could be bad like if the op amp oscillated at high frequencies producing a lot of distortion.  It could also potentially damage your speakers or headphone amp by producing high DC offset at the output causing a lot of current to flow across your headphones transducers and potentially destroying them. Check out this resource for more info  it might be a little dense but provides some ways that certain op amps can affect the amplification circuit.,audiophile,clkqzsj,1,t5_2qmiy

The output of this is what will go into the variable t above.    Here is a caveat I wrote this utility specifically to solve OPs problem and this utility will capture any song title that has the character T in it so do not run this on random folders because it will rename your songs fairly uncritically.

That would be taking all the sources in a song drums bass guitar vocals etc. and blending them appropriately with volume EQ panning compression etc. Mastering is more the art of making sure that all the tracks on a project sound like they were recorded at the same time in the same place in the same way. It also involves making up for discrepancies in the mixing process such as engineer bias or speaker response curves.

What are the different types and where might they be found?  Doesnt more coloration mean less overall clarity? ... and if so why do people prefer that listening experience?  For example Ive been ABing these three speakers for both music playback and for solo POD HD guitar.  The Line  Lm is bright and clear but missing the warmth and massive low end of the QSC K.  The QSC K is warm and deep but sounds rather boomy and muffled compared to the Line  Lm and KH.  The KH sounds sharp and clear but is completely missing the thick midlowend sonic body of the larger speakers.

2597529,0,t1_cmxltem,In theory but how many streams would an artist need to reach average wage income? Or for starters just how many streams to earn  bucks? Again smaller labels offer a fair deals. I used to work with different though admittedly really small labels. A  cut leaving  percent for the artist was pretty standard. Sure if you need to rent a studio have large upfront costs and hire external audio engineers it will be a struggle and make things harder but Im not sure if these things still apply to nonmajor bands and artists. These days the tools and equipment needed are available to anyone and its up to the artist to keep costs down. Producing great albums without large upfront costs or major label backing is certainly far from impossible.

2818323,0,t3_2scm5i,Well screwing up and realizing that a DAC isnt really necesary is also part of the journey. Doing AB testing on flac and  kbps is also part of the journey. Some people are just at an earlier point in their journey. And if you can get a decent dac and some flacs for under  whats the problem? Do you think anyone is actually denying that spending  on speakers to upgrade some Miccas is the best idea? I do agree that people worry too much about a sound card or DAC though. Its even worse in rheadphones. People new to the hobby think that a dac and a headphone amp is essential when they have some ATH ms... I think they do this because they see the  setups with HDs and Hifimans that actually need an amp and benefit from a DAC amp they think that its a quick way to get closer to what they see as a high level setup. I did this too. I got a fiio EK enjoyed it for a bit with my HDs. But once I got a nice yamaha receiver the ek wasnt really necessary because I could plug my headphones in and get enough power.I know rants like this happen weekly in every audio sub so Im pretty used to it. Unfortunately its probably falling on deaf ears. The bottom line is people just need to be conscious of their setup and what is working and what isnt necesary. Once you get a solid amp it should definitley last a very long time. Then you can focus on saving money for the real upgrades.. Like speakers.,audiophile,cnofq0m,1,t5_2qmiy

To me that means they are cool but it does bug them a bit Id rather not bug them so I picked up an an Auralex SubDude to place under the sub. I also have a background in acoustics if that means anything.With that in mind to your questionsgt Does isolating a subwoofer tighten the sound as claimed?Acoustically definate no unless there is something weird going on under your sub e.g. its sitting on ice. However I used to be able to feel the subwoofer vibrations through my feetcouch due to the transference through the floor I cant anymore. Does this make it tighter? I may actually say yes to this. You dont hear much under Hz in the normal sense of hear a lot of it comes from bone conduction through your skeleton to your ear drums and other body senses filling in. Since my couchfloor wasnt vibrating as much anymore I would say the result was a conceptual sharpening of the bass line. I wouldnt buy isolation for this reason personally anything i noticed was minor and probably mostly in my brain. i.e. my feet dont feel it anymore Im not bugging the neighbors therefore this sounds totally better!....wat?.gt Does isolating a subwoofer lessen sound transfer through the floor as claimed?Absolutely this is the reason to do it. Post SubDude I couldnt feel the vibration of the floor carpet on concrete under my feet anymore my couch didnt vibrate and my neighbor thought I stopped playing music as loud win!. But keep in mind that I live in a building with concrete floor cores and concrete between apartment units interior walls are normal drywall. I have good baseline isolation to work with and given the way concrete reacts to acoustic waves minimizing direct vibrations is very important. If you live in a wooden structure like a duplex or something I would guess youll see less effect.gt Is there an easycheap way to adequately isolate a subwoofer that doesnt involve paying  for rubber feet?I dont think there is anything special about the SubDude at all. Its a hunk of medium density foam. I bought it because in the US its fairly cheap? and doesnt look like shit. I would guess youll get the same effect from putting a piece of raw medium density foam under the sub but I havent tried.,audiophile,cnyskf5,2,t5_2qmiy
2910580,0,t1_cnypnz5,I would say go SVS. If you prefer clean bass over output than get the SB. If you went dual subs I would get the NXG Technology NXBAS or BIC PL. But you can always later add another SVS so keep that in mind. The room seems decently big and it extends through the kitchen but you do live in an apartment so how loud can you go? If you just want natural bass roll off than the SVS SB will be enough. If you want movie pounding bass than get a PB or duals.,audiophile,cnyxv6j,1,t5_2qmiy

2958161,0,t1_co4c7o0,Thanks for the post ..These last six months that Ive been researchingsearching for new speakers Ive seen at least a dozen different conflicting definitions of hifi.  The most common sentiment Ive come across is that hifi translates roughly to listening pleasure generally involving some type of coloration andor emphasisdeemphasis on certain frequency ranges.  In line with this the other info Ive gathered second hand and first hand is that studio monitors on the other end of the spectrum are generally not designed to be pleasurable to listen to and while they sound accurate they generally also sound colddullneutrallifeless.  This sounded to me to be the opposite of what people are generally terming hifi so I figured nonhifi might help clarify what I was originally trying to say.

Also to chip in on the actual DAC Under ideal circumstances the differences between a  and  DACs is small in particular with the types of headphones and speakers used with such a DAC. That said conditions arent always ideal  my experience with these cheap devices is that they often have little to no immunity to EMIRFI leaving you with effects such as ticking noises when hard drives spin up or when moving the mouse when the GPU is under load  DACs with their own power supply are often much better in this regard.  ,audiophile,cpwig17,3,t5_2qmiy

3867872,0,t3_34qlj7,You dont mention what  if you have any gear at the moment or a budget so Ill assume the worst case scenario that you have no gear and a minimal budget. Given that Id be looking at an amp with an AB speaker bindings for botheithernone speakers active paired with a DAC as source from your PCMac. Your local classified ads  eBay etc will be a good place to start amp wise. Id consider older s amps from manufacturers like Denon Rotel NAD Marantz etc etc. They should be pretty solid and dependable aesthetically pretty clean and generally neutral in sound for your needs. The amp will probably have an inbuilt headphone amp which will suffice unless you have really decent headphones at which point external amps might be worth looking at. The inbuilt ones usually disable speaker outputs however some models do offer switches to independently turn on speakers too.DAC wise theres loads of relatively cheap and affordable branded and nobrandchinese brand stuff on eBay for anything better than this Id recommend a hifi magazines classifieds as DACs are still typically a more specialist product hence less generally available. Headfi and other dedicated sites geared towards headphones will be able to advise b better than me here however I can recommend ADL labs GT as a nice relatively affordable example.If DACs arent available easily or youre spoilt for choice for the time being you may find an external sound card which is essentially a DAC anyway but less mechanically decoupled or even a phonojack cable connected from your PCMacs headphone port to AUX input on Amp may suffice for a time.Goodluck!,audiophile,cqx6621,2,t5_2qmiy

4039443,0,t1_crgld2c,The frequency plot is just known as a Spectrum  you can access them in various forms with different tools.  Most RTAs Real Time Analyzers  Im assuming you may have access to one or two with your instruments are more or less the same thing but real time.  Audacity has the ability to produce one as does Foobar and manymost other audio editors.  These particular ones are done with Adobe Audition.  I do not believe there is a way to make a spectrum plot more accessible since it is already a D plot.  This and its relatives are pretty ubiquitous though.  It is helpful to just listen to the audio and watch the spectrum to learn what is making what.  Hotter colors are hotter signal and colder colors are quieter signal so how loud the track is has a lot to do with what you look for but in both of these cases the mixmaster is pretty brickwalled so yellow is more or less AN INSTRUMENT IS PLAYING THIS FREQUENCY and red is more backgroundy.  If you listen and watch you can correlate specific features to instruments.  Regarding the production  it could be that it was done in post but I doubt it since that would require lots of bands of EQ in a very narrow range.  More than likely it is the product of the amp heads pedals pickups and other signal processors used.  Scooping the highs is not ubiquitous but it is common when you play loud to want less highs than bass and mids frankly they hurt when theyre loud while bass can be exciting and mids are more neutral in that respect.  When a system is deployed with a good budget there is someone whos job title is systems engineer and their job is to configure amps limiters the systemwide EQ phase and so on and so forth.  It is common for the response to be tilted like this using a home cinema tuning tool.  That slope is pretty extreme for home cinema levels but wouldnt be out of the ordinary for something as loud as a line array deployment.  For dB at m playback I personally would be looking at like a dB rolloff at k.  You can fix it with EQ.  There is some amount of danger there with phase issues EQ alters the phase uncontrollably and you could cause some nasty comb filtering but you only need a pretty small change.  So if you took the low end down like dB and raised the high end like dB youd make them linear.  You could get away with just a dB broadband boost from like kk too resulting in a subtle tilt.  Their FR is pretty suitable to playback in the dB range already.  E.g dbx EQs would be fine to fix it.  A flat system is more transparent to work with but is not necessary.  PA subs are orders of magnitude more durable than HT and studio subs out of necessity.  Their durability hampers their ability to get super low or super loud but thats the way of the world.  If durability is a concern dont even look at HT or studio subs and get a passive PA sub.  Itll be pretty gargantuan and not play as low but thats something to live with.  Alternatively the big tower PAs like whatever the biggest QSC K series tower is can sometimes play lower than PA subs but keep in mind they necessarily will have more distortion  but having it in one box can be nice.  Meyer is considered some of the best for PA stuff.  I think anyone who flat out considers one PA maker The Best. is a fool but meyers philosophy correlates very closely with mine flat make changes to the signal and their systems are phenomenal.  dB is more than dangerous  its as loud as a jet engine and you shouldnt be near it without hearing protection.  This was to cover a football field basically which is a very narrow but looooooooooong space to fill with sound.  The budget wouldnt accommodate a second stack half way down the field for fill a standard practice so we worked with what we had.  The barricades were m from the speakers so thats already a loss of dB for the front row.  We also ran the show about dB quieter than the sound check level.  EDM is really hard on your amps and subs because the spectrum of it approaches that of brown noise and the subs arent going to stray away from high capacity output for long at a time which tends to set them on fire when the voice coils overheat so we wanted to make sure it would survive.To quantify dB  consider how loud you play back well call it dB.  Now make it twice as loud.  And again.  And again.  And again.  And again.  And again.  And again.  And again.  ,audiophile,crgq6qw,2,t5_2qmiy

4064426,0,t1_crjk43x,Ive had passive noise blocking headphones more specifically the Sure EC inear monitors and I have tried the Bose noise canceling headphones. Theyre pretty different. The passive ones will let you listen to music quietly in almost any environment because they are actually earplugs that take everything down db. The drawback is that if you need to hear something like a person interrupting you or an alarm or phone ringing or anything else you will be unable to hear it.Whats really cool about the Bose is that theyre able to cancel out some noises like fans and vacuums and machines to a surprising degree but its still quite easy for somebody to say excuse me and interrupt you without screaming or getting in your face. This can be a big deal if you wear headphones at work. I didnt think that the Bose noise canceling headphones were the best sound id ever heard but the gimmick definitely works and the sound is solidly average for their form factor. I found them to be fairly comfortable too without having to press on your head nearly as hard as the passive circumaural designs. ,audiophile,crjknie,20,t5_2qmiy

However I dont want that on tracks that work better when left dynamic or were never meant to sound aggressive in the first place. You know you made a poor mastering decision when some of the newer remasters of Billy Joels The Stranger sound less dynamic than Mayhems De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas.I also listen to several independent bands and theres a few that as much as I love their music make piss poor decisions when it comes to their mixingmastering particuarly when it comes to the dynamic range of their tracks. On several songs of one band in particular it sounds like even the piano was crushed. Even with some more acoustic tracks I listen to sound too compressed.

4619005,0,t3_3e30bl,I went to the Rocky Mountain Audio Fest. There were four rooms that had me walking away impressed.The first was an ultrahigh sample rate recording of a marching band. Well into the millions on the sample rate. The product was the microphonedacadc combo. Safe to say it was out of my budget.The second room had some kpair speakers by a manufacturer that started with an R. I cant remember who Id have to go look at my notes.The third room was promoting a high end surround sound dac. They had Maggies set up in . in a hotel room. While that is worstcasescenario for Maggies not enough room they did sound great.The last room and the one that impressed me most was the Linkwitz Lab. When I walked in I noticed the room was fairly occupied. I saw the . and I was expecting an elitist asshole would be demoing them with very specific and obnoxious music and some people who have them would be circlejerking him complimenting their expense. I walked in and took the best seat I could find curious to find out what the oddly constructed .s would sound like. I dont recall exactly what he was playing possibly a quartet was the first thing I heard. I recall The imaging coming out of them was stunning. The presence of the sound in the room was commanding but it didnt sound like it was coming from speakers. When the song ended and he said we were listening to the Minis. My jaw nearly hit the floor. I had barely taken note of them being in the room. In fact I thought they were an extension of the oddly shaped . cabinets. Someone else was thinking the same and questioned him. He got up and clarified that we were only hearing the pillarshaped minis. The .s werent even connected to an audio source. The sound stage those little speakers offer is completely at odds with their footprint. I spent another song or two thinking the low end drivers from the . had to be helping out. Those . drivers are doing more than their size would indicate.After taking literature from his wife on the way out I was surprised that specs or an indication of price werent really available. Turns out you build the things. And theyre pretty affordable. Guess my assumption of an elitist asshole was way wrong.The only thing that has held me back from building some Minis is the need to biamp them.

4754571,0,t3_3fzq8j,I personally believe that people make too strong of a difference between monitors and hifispeakers. If we compare a pair of typical speakers to monitors this is what the differences are. Monitors are usually powered they have an amplifier built in. Passive speakers require a separate amplifier. . Monitors usually have balanced connections to allow connection to other pro audio equipment mixers amplifiers etc. These pro audio connectors also have a higher input voltage. Because of the increasing popularity of monitors for home use though less expensive monitors are also coming with input sensitivity switch so they can be used with consumer stuff easily. . Monitors are usually a bit more robust than hifi speakers meaning they can handle loud spikes a bit better. Because when one is mixing things shit happens and loud noises can come about. That being said a good amplifierregular speakers would probably be fine too but its less expected when compared to monitors. And thats it those are all the technical differences. You can voice the speaker however youd like. Meaning emphasis the midrange bass treble etc. There is no standard for monitors of hifi speakers the designers can do whatever. Usually monitors will be a bit hot in the midrange to help reveal any flaws. But this entirely depends on the monitor at hand its not a generalization of all monitors. Cheap speakers usually sound like crap you do need to get a pair of half decent speakers for good sound. But anybody can call some powered speakers monitors and also have them sound like crap. tldr Good speakers are good bad ones are bad. What the marketing department calls them doesnt mean much at the end of the day.,audiophile,cttuxqd,7,t5_2qmiy

There was a definite increase in sound quality during the break in so I can promise you they will get better. Im not familiar with your receiver but since its designed for AV make sure its outputting stereo. Try to make sure your source audio is at least kbs. CD quality or higher is preferred. Double check that the wiring is correct. Like others were saying your sound preferences might be different too. Those arent partypushing club speakers. Dalis tend to be warm and light on the bass.

Offaxis performance depends on many things crossover point size of drivers the shape of the cone dome width of cabinet etc.It is beyond unlikely that  speakers will be so similar.What all this means is that even if  speakers measure similarly onaxis under anechoic conditions which is the only way to make any comparison given your question they would interact differently in the same room yielding a different inroom frequency response.There is also distortion performance to account for.

5116970,0,t3_3l0xd4,gt Why are tube amps so special?Tube amps were actually the first electric amplification technology they carry both benefits and drawbacks when compared to modern solid state equipment.PositivesTubes allow for nearly limitless customization by endusers. By replacing tubes with those of a different type or from a different manufacturer tube rolling users can customize their sound signature. This is made possible because tubes add harmonic distortion to the signal most people find this pleasant and feel as though tubes add realism and warmth to the sound. Also tubes are just more attractive from an aesthetic perspective glowing glass tubes have more character and style than the black rectangular boxes that hold many solid state amplifiers.NegativesTube amplifiers are often underpowered sometimes barely reaching W this can be an issue powering modern speakers that arent especially efficient. Tubes are also expensive delicate and give off more heat than a comparable solid state device. Some feel as though they are inferior to solid state amps as they are less accurate in their sound reproduction.gt Why does it reduce grown men to drooling babies?Just like any other hobby expensive equipment especially equipment that is aesthetically pleasing has this effect.gt In what situations are these used?In any situation in which one wishes to amplify a signal tube amps are mostly found paired with high efficiency speakers as most true tube amps have very low power output compared to similar solid state offerings.gt Is there any alternative without loss in last mile sound quality?It depends on your school of thought. If accurate sound is what you are looking for solid state is the way to go. As stated above tubes color the sound by adding pleasant harmonic distortion.gt What is their range in terms of Benjamins?Stereo Tube amps vary in cost.    Chinese tube amps purchased through ebay or alibaba    Low to MidGrade vintage amplifiers more expensive Chinese tube amps are also found in this range.

5180766,0,t3_3lwszg,The problem with trying to use audiophile speakers targeted at for home use is they are usually trying to create very precise imaging in a single spot. Most home speakers arent meant to broadcast over a wide area like youd need in a bar. You could look into a line array system like this which supposedly has the unique property of maintaining a consistent volume as you get closer to the speaker. Which in a bar setting would be nice getting stuck next to the speakers and going deaf sucks.Personally if I were designing a space that had to pull double duty Id go with a carefully chosen PA system room acoustic treatments and active room correction like Dirac Live. I believe Dirac Live adds about  ms of lag to the audio processing so it cant be used for live shows but for prerecorded music where it doesnt matter it could make a huge difference. Designing the space well and choosing speakers with the correct dispersion patterns is key though.,audiophile,cvah068,3,t5_2qmiy

5563678,0,t1_cwmpsoe,gt If its all connected internally I cant see too many amplifier issues other than just wasting electricity.The impedance of the output stage of an amplifier is something like . ohms. If it werent low how would we see damping factors of  and higher which are quite common? Im not an electrical engineer but Im assuming that if two amp channels are connected together the amp will see a very low apparent impedance and try to shove a crap ton of current through the other amp channel because electrons love taking the path of least resistance. In the best case it would shut down. In the worst case it could melt something.gt Theyd probably run into more issues with the converse and people blowing their speakers by sending bass to the tweeters.As I understand it when you remove the jumpers the crossover network should turn into a standalone lowpass filter for the woofer and a standalone highpass filter for the tweetermids. There should be no danger of sending bass to the tweeters.,audiophile,cwmq3ha,1,t5_2qmiy

5809995,0,t3_3urq2z,Well you cant beat physics so there is still need for a mix of drivers.  A multiway setup does require good hardware and good tuning.  You can find bad examples as easy as you can find good ones.The wideband driver can be nice because it reduces complexity.  However physics is a bitch.  For example a large wideband driver will have significant beaming not a problem just as long as You can always be onaxis from the driver when listening.  It can be nice to passively reduce reflections too.One thing you might want to look at is distortion levels through the frequency range.  Also the frequency response typically isnt as smooth as youll find with a more idealized driver for that frequency range.,audiophile,cxha9nt,2,t5_2qmiy

6210284,0,t1_cyv9v21,Gonna have to be the bearer of bad news here but many people find the original Japanese Black Triangle pressing best. It was manufactured from  to early  at Sonys plants and has an excellent flatfromtape master thats pretty much hissfree. The successive versions with the EMI mastering are worse but visually almost indistinguishable. Bad news These originals sell for much much more than the MFSL Golds because a theyre Japanese so collectors value is already high and b they sound great which only adds an audiophile aspect to the increasing value.Beware when trying to get one though many Discogs entries for instance are mislabeled and want to sell you an EMI version via the Sony release page. Be sure to ask for the CDs matrix number everything that doesnt say TO or AR afair is worth gold the rest not so much. There is also a link on Discogs to a great page detailing all the subtle differences between these first CD releases.These versions are also some of the few CDs with preemphasis so special care needs to be taken when ripping.,audiophile,cyvjj9i,4,t5_2qmiy

Period. The tracks purchased and downloaded this way belong to him and can be transferred and used on any devices Apple or otherwise that supports the AAC format.Regarding the impact of adding an Apple Music layer on top of his library which in OPs case would be the exact opposite of the goal hes trying to achieve all he needs to do to keep them separate is to use two iTunes accounts.

The short answer is if you crave high volume have wild parties or a huge room the more the merrier. Before we go any further lets be clear on what amplifier power provides it defines the upper limit of how loud your speakers can play without distorting. So if loudness is a big priority buy as much power and the biggest speakers you can afford if you listen at fairly moderate volume dont worry about your receiver or amplifiers power rating. For most people  watts will be more than enough. ,audiophile,d0eahtw,3,t5_2qmiy

6918894,0,t3_4ahjfh, Does the hissing occur even when the monitor is not connected to a source? Disconnect from PC and listen If the hiss DOES happen without being connected to a source then its the speaker itself the amp in the speaker and you wont be able to do anything about it.In this case you can either live with it see if turning down the gain on the back of the speaker helps or move the speakers further away from you... or return them but beware restocking fees if they apply. If the hiss does NOT occur when disconnected from the source which I bet is the case since the hiss changes as the mouse moves then you need to upgrade your connection to the source andor the speakers.Either an external DAC like the ODac or Schiit Modi will do the job.

6971380,0,t3_4b6aid,The signal delivered to your speakers by different wires will be different for various reasons. This is true regardless of whether the cables are normally connected or biwired. Whether or not your drivers render those differences in a way that you can perceive is a different question.Cables are not ideal so the signal entering will be different than the signal exiting. Each cable is also at least a resistor a capacitor an inductor and an antenna. Resistance and capacitance act on the voltage and current respectively passing through the cable while inductance can exert motive forces on nearby cables and conductors. As an antenna your cable might pick up stray noise. And because the audio signal is an AC signal the cable will also experience impedance which changes with the signal that the cable carries. Adding more cable as when biwiring between your signal and your driver introduces more opportunities for each of the different factors to act on your signal.Cable composition geometry shielding adjacent cabling and the nature of the signal itself will affect what the cable does to the signal. If one cable is even slightly easier or more difficult for your amp to drive than another cable you might be hitting or missing sweet spots in your amps components with respect to effective noise filtering signal processing and amplification power output etc. which may get magnified by the amplification itself.Is it possible that youre hearing the slight stiffening or blurring or dampening etc. of the signal that reaches your drivers? Maybe. Will you be able to objectively identify or control for the many different variables at play and identify the ones that make the most difference to what you hear? It would be a challenge with a physically and electrically noisy typical household environment.,audiophile,d16jkfk,2,t5_2qmiy

The Component connection are meant as Inputs to the TV ...say... from an old VCR. On the Amp the only input you cant use is the PHONO in. That is strictly for turntables all the others  CD AUX TAPE and other inputs on the amp are the same. Check through the Audio Setup Menus on your TV. It might be possible to set the Audio Out to FIXED or VARIABLE. FIXED in like any standard Line Level Out it does not change when you change the TV Volume Control. VARIABLE is the opposite. It will change with the TV Volume Control. If you Amp has its own Remote Volume Control use FIXED.

7162473,0,t1_d1sa3uc,Got it yeah perhaps it is time to upgrade the speakers. I have CM Ss at my office that share some of the same components as the s and yes they definitely can be played without a sub and sound fantastic. There will be some dropoff that you can start to sense around  Hz and if you like movies and a good rumble then you will be missing out without a sub. I take it since your receiver is a HT receiver you like movies.The ASW is the matching  series sub that would match the look of the s and is a decent sealed box performer that sounds awesome with music. If you like movies though for the same price I would look at perhaps SVS ported box subs unless you really like the matching look and small footprint of the . Aesthetics are important so dont feel bad about that. I look at some of the humongous HSU or JL Audio subs over at rhometheater that are the size of a small car and I could never be ok with looking at that all day.The Denon AVR SW is a good entry level receiver with a very decent room correction setup called Audyssey.

Also please realize that these  samples per second are merely goal posts for the sine wave to hit its not creating a stepped stair case wave like some people seem to think it is it takes that staircase pattern and draws a line that hits each level creating a smooth sine wave. For a higher sample rate to reveal a detail that is lost with the lower rate that detail would have to be of imperceptible short length.,audiophile,d1uieh9,4,t5_2qmiy

No matter what though that leads to down votes in this sub. With quality gear there is absolutely a discernible improvement with a higher resolution source. If I could invite Reddit to my house I would AB the same songs and many of you would hear the difference some would not. It takes both the gear and a serious ear. For me it is the higher frequencies I believe. It leads to a slightly more natural and open sound with clean resonance. I lived with both Spotify and Tidal for  years before dumping Spotify. I can also hear it in the recordings I make using Sonar Producer. Well I probably just joined the down vote train but who cares its worthless karma. ,audiophile,d25nhuz,0,t5_2qmiy

Open the Audio MIDI setup app. Open the Audio Devices Window by pressing Cmd  or selecting it from the window menu. Set the sample rate to Heres the thing provided that OS X is set to the same sample rate as the file youre playing Sound Enhancements EQ and Sound Check are off the output from the OS X preview and iTunes will be bit for bit identical with the output in the preview  Theyre using the same framework to decode the MP and OS X has a uniform means of outputting audio unlike Windows or Linux.What does differ in iTunes contra OS X preview is that it as shown in the preferences can enable a few extra processing nodes EQ Sound Enhancer which should be disabled as long as youre not outputting to the builtin speakers of a Macbook or Macbook Pro the automatic volume adjustment Sound Check.  In addition to these iTunes uses its own internal resampler if the file being played is using a different sample rate than the sample rate set by the system.That said if youre hearing a difference Sound check is very likely what youre hearing  the effect of the resampler is so subtle that you normally wont hear the difference between the system one and the iTunes one and even when you do hear the difference its very subtle.  Edit Sound check will  for most songs  lower the volume of a song which due to how the ear works lead to less air even if the volume has been lowered just enough to not be perceptible as a change in volume.,audiophile,d27acpv,3,t5_2qmiy

7309337,0,t3_4ffb8p,As Zurevu said there is typically only one midrange driver.The advantage to having an independent midrange driver is theoretically cleaner midrange. That one driver just needs to reproduce the mids and leave bass to another driver. This would theoretically lead to cleaner bass too.That said this is true of any way design and can be found in bookshelf speakers.If you are strictly comparing way bookshelf speakers to way or higher floorstanding speakers the advantage to bookshelf speakers could be that they are great for small rooms and tricky placement.The last time I bought speakers I noticed that most bookshelf speakers were less than  deep and would be under  high on a stand.

7611591,0,t3_4jir58,My opinionsPros Price Sound quality is fine once you turn off the dynamic range compression that is on by defaultCons It sometimes takes several attempts to start streaming Spotify Premium playback is not gapless Googles protocol requires explicit support from the developer or hacking together third party solutions Getting stuff to playback is a convoluted process at times though mainly because I use the poorly implemented volume control. I have two CCAs and one goes straight into a pair of amplifiers with audio sensing so the CCA controls the master volume. To start playback I usually fire up Spotify Premium on my phone to initiate the streaming session. Because you cant initiate streaming to a Chromecast Audio from the Spotify desktop app. Spotify will start streaming and then I can control it from my Spotify desktop app on my MacBook. Great! Except you can only see the current volume setting in the desktop app you cannot change it. If you want to turn it up or down you have to open up Spotify on your phone and change it there using the phones volume updown hardware keys.  Another instance of the volume control issue  sure you can stream Tidal through the web player using the Chromecast extension but you cant change the volume. Youve gotta pull out your phone again and this time fire up the Google Cast app navigate to the device hit the volume button and use the slider control on the UI to change it instead of the hardware keysIMO the Chromecast Audio is a half assed product saved only by its price. As a programmer it kills me to see developers not putting forth the extra marginal effort it would have taken to just make volume control work from a desktoplaptop. I effectively need  two devices to stream Tidal.In comparison I think Apples AirPlay has more user friendly implementation. AirPlay is able to stream from the system level on iOS and the Mac meaning applications dont have to do anything special to work. Volume controls work from the device you are actually using too. If youre streaming from your phone the hardware keys control volume even when the phone is locked and it automatically pauses content when you get a phone call. Meanwhile with CCA you have to unlock your phone open the app that was streaming wait for it to reconnect to the CCA and then you have control which can take a good  seconds sometimes. When I get a phone with CCA going I have to answer it and shout WAIT LET ME PAUSE MY MUSIC HOLD ON. The downsides to AirPlay though are increased adapter price increased battery consumption and lately its been choppy for me.,audiophile,d37ecfc,3,t5_2qmiy

7867066,0,t3_4n0fam,Im a speaker person myself but I suspect the societal and economic conditions of millennials caused this more than anything . This article missed it completely IMHO. The transition to headphones in my opinion is a reflection of younger people are renting far more than buying their own place. Headphones are a lot cheaper and far more private. It makes absolute sense to invest in a nice headphone setup for a rental type situation.  Wages have stagnated for a long time and time is scarce so people cant buy speakers that is worth half the value of their car randomly nor do they have the time do DIY a sweet up. Its a lot more accessible to buy some decent Sennheisers with a great amp and DAC for under However on the flip side there is definitely another transition. Large sound systems are becoming quite common and known even for non dance music. Its a lot easier to go to a show with great sound for cheap than it was even ten years ago. I would strongly argue hifi has gone out of private life and serves a ritualistic communal purpose now more or less.  Spending a few hundred to go to a weekend festival with great sound is a lot more appealing to me and countless other people than spending thousands to get similar sound quality alone. Will hifi stereo ever become largely private again? No idea but if economic conditions get better for young people and they have more disposable money and are able to buy their own property rather than rent...then perhaps but I cant say for certain however there will always be a niche community.In the end the age of classic hifi is long gone for now and has gone into two polar opposite directions. Purely private headphones and purely communal large sound systemsPAs..etc.  Its an interesting contrast for sure and almost dialectic in a HegelianMarxist sense Im too hesitant to call it that proper.

7912958,0,t1_d43ca12,What I mean is for the entire system to be designed with something like a minidsp in mind. Currently nearly all speakers with some exceptions like the Vanatoo and some very expensive speakers are designed to sound good without DSP correction. If you intended to use it from the start you might choose completely different drivers. You would also not use analog crossovers at all. THAT is a game changer both for manufacturing costs but also for designing speakers. Crossover design is integral to speaker design and DSP makes that so much easier. Keep in mind that putting minidsp in front of a way speaker the analog crossover is still there unless you rip the thing out solder the post straight to the speaker and biamp it. And along those lines in order to get rid of the analog crossover and use a digital crossover instead you have to maintain separate audio channels through amplification. So for a way system youre triamping. But with an integrated system without an analog crossover you can drive the speakers way more efficiently and the amplifier can be perfectly matched impedance and whatever else to the individual driver. Anyway Im just grazing the surface of whats possible when you design the entire system from the ground up with DSP much the way Vanatoo has. With all this keep in mind that frequency response isnt everything. Theres timing the amount of air being moved and every other complicated nuance of sound reproduction so easy and effective solutions to some problems via DSP at the design stage could allow you to focus on that next thing. What would a new driver from SEAS look like if they were ready to use DSP to fix any equalization issues? And when you consider designing DSP the amp and the speaker all together like that theres a lot more the amp could do e.g. the kind of junk Technics is advertising. So my instinct is that more complete and unified systems designed from the ground up with DSP in mind will make a huge difference in the kind of sound system you can buy for something like  or whatever,audiophile,d45hp1a,1,t5_2qmiy

8168585,0,t1_d4yll05,This has nothing to do with HTPC vs hardware players.  I used the wrong word when I said delays  the correct word is latencies  as in delay from you input a sound until anything is output.This doesnt impact normal AV receivers at all as the lowhigh pass filters for a sub are of the IIR type.A FIR filter is special in that it can accurately preserve phase the relative delay between two sounds at different frequencies.  However in order to do so effectively it needs to read a fair number of samples so it can analyze the full waveform of a particular frequency.  Now the wavelength of a lowfrequency sound is long so it has to read more samples before it can do any form of processing on it.   Reading more samples means it has to wait longer hence the latency.There are to my knowledge only two products aimed at the home market excluding those for DIY developers that use FIR filtering  the Kii Audio Three and BangampOlufsen Beolab .TLDR This isnt about offsets.  Its overall system latency and an average AV receiver or processor isnt affected.,audiophile,d4ymfdf,1,t5_2qmiy

8321374,0,t3_4tecz8,About a year ago I purchased some Mirage OM towers.  They have been one of the best purchases Ive made the difficulty has been in finding a center channel that matches them.  I bought the newer OS CC and the PTH tweeter plus omnipolar design make for a good sound match but the speaker cant produce the lows or the volume that I need to match the OMs.  Once I get it loud enough it sounds strained.  The speaker that I want most is the OMC but they are impossible to find especially at a price that I can justify spending no more than  preferably closer to .  I have been considering the OMC but Im afraid that Ill be disappointed again just like I was with the OSCC.  Does anyone have any knowledge about these speakers or have an idea for an alternate center that might match the OMs closely enough to be a good addition?

It could work for you but in general combining signals with a cheap mixer like that will reduce the quality and level of the output signal so the output will be quieter than the input.

8600503,1,t1_d6gmdjl,I have been in the industry years ago and have had the chance to hear many combinations.  Personally this is the combo I like in terms of sound.  As I mentioned in a previous post the cables are not the first part of the optimization chain.  Without the highest resolution equipment  speakers the cable will matter less and less as it will be too hard to hear the change wire can make.  People who canhave heard the difference dont necessarily think it is a value decision.  Its a lot of money for incremental gains but on my system the difference is obvious.  Also on the conductor issue there are more complex issues at play than conducting.  Pulsing an AC current with high power speaker level results in induction along the cable.  Any multistranded wire of same gauge with the same signal each have an inductive field.  The induction in turns causes emf along the wire.  By reducing the resonance at specific frequencies and creating nonharmonic inductance the less resonant the emf.  Then there is skin effect.  Differences in the frequency transmitted through the wire travel differently along the wire.  the effect is further amplified and caused by inductive emf so the current density is greatest along the outside of the wire where the signal tends to propagate.  Unlike DC current alternating current has wildly varying current density through the diameter.  This tells us that a multistranded design makes sense to optimize current density  surface area.  As the skin effect varies by diameter of the core in relationship with the surface area of that diameter and frequency it makes sense to have several diameter wires involved in the multistrand model preferably nonharmonic.  To further reduce induction induced emf wrap each varying diameter layer in alternating directions at shallow angles.  Does this have an effect on audio?  I hear something I like that is different than cables I have also tried.  A character to the sound which I enjoy.  To say you have never heard it is actually to say you have not heard it yet. ,audiophile,d6gnmmc,0,t5_2qmiy

I think it actually comes with a .mm to RCA cable so another option would just be to add an RCA to TS cable to each RCA end. Note that the JBL inputs are technically TS not TRS because each speaker takes a mono signal one left one right.gt  Ive seen people talking about it being unbalanced and causing a humhiss. Is that something to be concerned aboutProbably not. Unbalanced connections are more susceptible to interference but its not a common problem. In most cases where people are complaining about a hiss with these speakers it is probably a background hiss from the class D ampsomewhat unavoidable but not a dealbreaker in most cases.

If they do not utilize possibilities right.Even if apple does it right on phone side and sends data in good quality over both channels to BT headphones there is still problem on headphone side because they have to do DAC conversion and amplification now.

When listening to my Grados? Nope I use an O amp with USB DAC. The only time I use the .mm jack is with my old Bose QuietComfort headphones during flights. But just the other day a guy in my office showed up with a new pair of QuietComfort wireless headphones that really caught my attention. It occurred to me that I should upgrade my QuietComfort cans to the wireless version for convenience  after all even my wired QuietComforts have a battery.Finally I realized that the failure point on every pair of headphones Ive ever owned was the cable usually right where its moulded to the .mm plug. ,audiophile,d7e7fxh,2,t5_2qmiy

Im getting a fair amount of driver flutter with moderate volumes when using my TT Sansui SR AT cartridge. The flutter isnt consistent so Im fairly certain Im dealing with feedback and not warp. Ive recalibrated my tone arm and bias several times as well. Im using a Marantz  receiver and the low and high filters mitigate the flutter but the filters thin outstrip out the sound which sucks. Also seeing it in all records not just loudnoisy pressings. My iPodMacbook sound fine and arent causing feedback.  Ive done a bit of DIY tinkering which has reduced the issue to some degree but Im aiming to play bassheavy tracks at loud volumes so I went ahead and ordered an Auralex TT isolation pad.The isolation pad shows up in a few days so in the meantime I wanted to see if I could glean isolation tips from yall.Ive adjusted the speaker placement since taking this photo they are now toed in a touch and they are about ft from the back wall.

For example if your crossover point is hz and your crossover slope is dboctave that means your sub is playing very audible content its only down by db all the way up at hz and is slightly audible even higher than that.This article goes into it a little more.The argument against stereo subwoofers is a little difficult for me to understand. The argument generally goes like this the ideal placement for subs in terms of max SPL output is often different than the ideal placement for speakers. Well that is true and for theatergaming purposes I agree. But for twochannel music Im more interested in pure sound than max SPL.,audiophile,d8xp8lf,2,t5_2qmiy

The soundstage has been significantly expanded upon much wider and more depth. The sound is a little too forward now for my room Im sitting much too close. I have no choice at the moment and my couch is right up against the wall. Initially it the sound was a little too bright but it seems as time goes on the amp is settling in. Or my ears are adjusting. Sound has been vastly improved upon watching television at low volumes. I can now turn the volume way down and can leave it not worrying about turning it up during quiet parts and vice versa. I have been breaking it in mostly with music starting with the album Run by Awolnation followed by Rumours by Fleetwood Mac Rattle That Lock by David Gilmour and Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails. Late last night I watched Interstellar on Bluray and WallE. Ive also kept the tone controls turned off.

The Rel T Zero is small discrete and beautiful. We have an open concept kitchen living room and dining room which is about m by m and it fill in very nicely. The volume is set at about half and the crossover is around . I would say it lacks the punch and precision of larger subs for movies but for music I never think about it. I listen  to hiphop EDM and other bass heavy music with absolute pleasure. I would definitely give it a try chances are its all you will need.

I can buy a  vintage ampturntablewhatever that will destroy anything new simply because those vintage devices were  in  and technology hasnt really changed that much.Vintage gear is coming back mainly because of the vinyl resurrection but also as people from that era are reaching retirement and are looking to rebuild their old systems for nostalgia purposes. Now that were a few years in and the demand for vintage gear is rising people are taking advantage and raising their prices accordingly. Supply and demand.There are amplifiers that are absolutely built better and perform better than gear from any decade in history and they are available at around the same cost as well built amplifiers sold for in their respective eras.Headphones and digital audio are really where the large advancements in sound reproduction have been. ,audiophile,dc8dbp6,25,t5_2qmiy

10707715,0,t3_5t4l76,gt Ive never understood why tech questions are banned here. First off a subreddits front page is supposed to be a shared resource where the intent is that each post contributes something new or interesting to the community.  It is also a limited resource  There are at any given time only  slots available.  The problem with purchase help and tech support is that the posts dont foster reasonable discussion  They are posts where any reply only serves a single individual rather than the community as a whole.  In other words They have no interest for the regular users of this subreddit and makes this subreddit a worse place for them.   Manymost of the questions we receive are also repeat posts or posts whose answers are found on the first page of any reasonable google search.Over the last four days we have on average removed more than  tech support and purchase help questions every day.  On busier days you can multiply that number by around four and within a years time you can expect the low number to roughly double  raudiophile recently started showing up by default on loggedout users reddit front page and with the current subscriber growth rate were looking at in excess of   subscribers by September this year.In other words if we allowed these posts to stand they would completely displace virtually all other content.

Its not exactly hard to measure output voltage across the terminals. According to your logic plugging a v lightbulb would only draw  volts if you wired it up to .Too much available power wont damage a speaker.If you damaged your BampWs it means you tried to drive them passed their max recommend SPL.Wrong again. There is no recommened SPL theres a recommended power range which is    watts. My BampW s are biamped with a pair of Parasound HCA II amps which are rated at wpc   ohms. Next to each speaker is an amp one channel drives the two woofers and the other channel drives the mid amp tweet. Thats  watts of total power  w per channel. I also owned a pair of Carver Amazing loudspeakers for nearly  years and sold them about a year after I bought my BampWs. I drove them with a Marantz Model   wpc Parasound HCA  wpc Parasound HCAII  wpc a single Parasound HCA II  wpc and finally a pair of Parasound HCA II amps in bridged mode w mono. The only time I ever damaged a driver on the Carvers was when running my amps bridged and playing some bassheavy music extremely loud.

11498999,0,t3_63k7un,Hello everyone!  I appreciate good sound but Im not very proficient at setting it up.  I live in an apartment currently so I cant do anything too crazy.  Im hoping to buy a house soon and eventually build a home theater room.  Ill try to keep this brief.Several years back I bought an Onkyo HTIB.  It was the Onkyo HTS set.  To get me started it was pretty alright but I wont be buying Onkyo products again... the receiver broke twice once under warranty.  After it broke the second time I upgraded to a Denon AVRCI receiver.  At that point I was using the Denon receiver with the Onkyo speakers and subwoofer.  Fast forward to this week a buddy of mine who IS an audiophile just got married and is moving in with his wife.  His awesome speakers wouldnt fit andor go with his new house or something so he is looking to sell them.  He had these speakers built custom and said he spent around  for them.  Its two fronts two backs and a center.  Way bigger than what I have but I want them... hes offered them to me for .  Hes let me set them up in my apartment to try them out first.  Here are some pictures of them so the more savvy folks might have a better idea of what theyre capable of.  Covers removed to show off the speakers... Note that this DOESNT include a new subwoofer so Im now running a Denon receiver two of the custom front speakers a custom center speaker the Onkyo subwoofer and four Onkyo surround speakers.  I have two of the custom speakers for surround as well but I havent set them up yet due to space restrictions.So Im a big gamer and this week Persona  came out which Im super pumped about and its known for its great music.  However I think I dont have the receiver configured right.  The bass is kind of overwhelming and thats just on the frontcenter speakers still using old Onkyo sub.  I feel like the bass line in music is drowning out the rest of the game.  I tried resetting most of the settings on the receiver but havent made much progress.  Unfortunately I cant find the Audyssey microphone to run the wizard again...  TLDR Can anyone tell me what kind of settings I need to play with to tame the bass down on these new speakers?  And still have the sound be decent?  Im worried that the dang speakers alone are probably enough to bother my neighbors since I can feel it through the floor and I dont wanna be that guy.  Bonus question... I trust my friend fully and dont think he would try to sell me anything bad.  But is there any reason anyone can think of why buying these speakers is a bad idea?Thanks everyone!,audiophile,dfzetgo,1,t5_2qmiy

11514266,0,t1_dg14ru6,Yeah generally Id bias your spend towards the speakers.  JBL I dont know about.  Im in the UK where they dont have much of a reputation in hifi circles but from what I see on here they come highly recommended so are probably worth a look.  You could take a look at Cambridge Audio they have amps from  and again you cant go too far wrong with them.  KEFs and Monitor Audios start at about .  If that leaves you with spare money you can either go for a more powerful amp wouldnt hurt as most entry level speakers are good for about W but the amps are more like  or maybe going up to better speakers.Come to think of it Richer Sounds sell all of those brands and are happy to set up a demo for you if you call ahead.  Id drop by there and have a listen ,audiophile,dg156lw,1,t5_2qmiy

Should I just route my PCs audio straight through the...Scarlett gt Amp gt Headphones? Or should I route the PC and Scarlett Microphone Audio gt Mixer gt Amp gt Headphones? Or something else?

But I dont know if a mixer will degrade the quality of the ampPC.

11566451,0,t1_dg70sr8,gt No one wants cassette decks. Literally no one.This is your original point I disagreed with. In my experience a lot of people do want cassettes for the reasons Ive attempted to explain. Whether or not you personally agree with those reasons is irrelevant to the fact that more labels are making them more people are buying them and this will increase demand for secondhand components and thus their price.Im probably somewhat at fault here by disparaging CD. I own thousands of them. I also own a turntable with a smaller collection of vinyl but do most of my listening on a DAP or PC with desktop amp and Beyer headphones. I prefer lossless digital but I also like to own records because I like collecting them for emotional reasons. If I can have a cassette shipped to me via bandcamp with a digital download as well for the same price why not? Handmade cassettes from Indie bands are collectable and valuable to me and Id probably be willing to put up with the lower sound quality to listen to one occasionally just as Im willing to put up with dust on a pickup or having to flip a record. That puts me in the market for a secondhand cassette deck. If there are others like me theyre also in the market for one which means pawn shops etc. are more likely to sell them which will eventually drive up the price.Thats all Im saying.gt One other thing people these days are too quick to assume everyone should be labelled as part of niche groups.Thats exactly what you did buy calling anyone who buys a cassette a hipster. Like you Im interested in maximizing sound quality as far as possible and have spent a lot of time and money building different systems to do that. At risk of diluting my main argument by starting another about the definition of what an audiophile is let me just say this people can be audiophiles complete with the associations of gear fetishism music lovers geeks and collectors of all kinds of music formats at the same time. You should use your knowledge to be more welcoming of people to raudiophile community instead of a high horse to stand on to make yourself seem important. Accept that people are different from you and while they might enjoy different things than you it doesnt make them ignorant fools deserving of scorn and mockery. Probably in real life you are a nice person and helpful and happy to share your knowledge but here youre coming across as arrogant.,audiophile,dg729fj,1,t5_2qmiy

11597248,0,t1_dgah5jv,For free Google lets you upload your music library to their cloud you then can stream it to your phone or other devices as well as download it similar to Spotify. Music downloaded on a phone cant be opened in other music software just the Google play music app. Also Google doesnt maintain file type I think it at most does kbps.

11620564,0,t3_65srw0,Because most audiophiles dont need units with digital outputs mixers preamps etc?  I know I dont which is why I went with a normal DAC a TEAC UD. If the price is the same then all of that other stuff means they have to skimp on quality somewhere.,audiophile,dgd79w2,1,t5_2qmiy
11624374,0,t1_dgdedkq,I dont disagree that if youre willing to build your own DIY subs and a clever well balanced rig you could surpass these for  or a bit less even  I know thats true and its a well made point btw.The thing is space is a serious issue in most major cities for younger listeners  lets say under   and most people dont want want dual s in a sealed box in their  sqft apartment. Its a different strokes sort of thing this. Also as Ive mentioned elsewhere in other replies  if youre in the Bay Area and can afford the time please PM me and Ill just leave you alone to see for yourself no expectations. Theyre closer to their specs than you might imagine and thats more than surprising when youre listening to them  its hideously fun.We sell a ton of well known gear thats way more expensive but in a hobby that is sorely in need of new blood these ridiculous things make people smile and take them home way more than youd imagine  and never get returned.,audiophile,dgdmumg,4,t5_2qmiy

You could get an SVS SB or Rythmik L sub for the low end and probably end up with a better sound than one Phantom Silver. Or if you did want to learn a bit you could do really well with  in a nonwireless speaker setup and switch out just your wireless streaming component when you want to accommodate new standards.

I recently decided that I wanted to remove the two satellite speakers from the .s and use the subwoofer through my receiver on the subwoofer out plug in. I already have a .mm to RCA converter. My one concern is that since the subwoofer is powered it has a built in amplifier. Will the subout on my receiver ALSO attempt to amplify my subwoofer?

11806150,0,t1_dgy6z1e,gt To say that the older amps have less distortion cant be true if were comparing old apples to new apples.The problem is that you are often spreading the budget much thinner with a modern HDMI equipped receiver.  The distortion really is higher.  Receivers are usually quoted with one or two channels driven and much higher THD than you would find for a simple hifi amp.  Also factor in inflation and youd have to spend a big wedge to get the sound you get from a s or s simple hifi amp.,audiophile,dgy9nj4,2,t5_2qmiy
