Just set it to cycle the battery a few times and wait until it is done.

There are already a few companies offering s servos but the receivers havent all caught up.  The standard servo connector and g wire are too small for large setups and if were stuck with a standard servo connector the only way to run increasing wattage in servos is higher voltage.Any receiver bus should be able to handle a ton of current relative to the demand the constraint is usually the amp servo connectors and in the case of some brands the lack of a direct soldered connection to the bus gt large connector gt battery.I like s lifealipo gt soft switch gt receiver either directly connected to the bus or  servo connectors into the receiver.

Regs run in parallel where one lipo is mostly depleted before the other one even starts.  People trying to use internal bec to power large setups.

2450929,0,t3_2nlbjr,The incidents sounded extremely editorialized so I did some digging. Im going to do a more thorough search after I get home from work and do a proper comparison of any of the events that match the datescenario in the article and then copypaste the actual pilots account for comparison along with confirmation of any legitimate encounters. So far a quick search of all incidents involving drones on the ASRS database is leading me to believe that the majority of this article is complete BS. Especially the incidents involving interviews with the Cessna pilots. A few of these interviews appear to be completely made up.UPDATE After a lot of searching and finding the FAA list that was used to write this article it appears that the majority of the list of incidents provided in the article are indeed factual according to the FAA. I have found that the information on these incidents appears to have originated from an article and a list released by the NYT which claims to have received the list directly from the FAA. In fact the list is somewhat concerning and shows that there are a lot of idiots out there flying multirotors at unsafe altitudes however NMAC incidents are still very rare. The ASRS database wouldnt include all incidents as it is a voluntary database but there were still eleven  NMAC incidents recorded there for this year however not all were confirmed with complete certainty to be drones. Here is a link to a list of ALL drone sightings reported to the FAA this year up until  This list will download in Chrome but the link doesnt work in Firefox. This list if truly legitimate was originally provided by the NYT article link is in this forbes article The FAA list has  entries however it is not clear what the lists purpose is because the vast majority of entries are sightings and not incidents that put any aircraft in danger. I am not going to create a synopsis of all of the incidents in the FAA list because it will take ages to sift though. If anybody has more energy than I do please feel free to comment on this post with any findings. I went through the ASRS database AND the list that I found of officially recorded incidents by the FAA more thoroughly and this is what I found. It took me quite a while to find any public record of these incidents that the FAA is and apparently has been using as ammunition in order to push for regulation.  As far as the ASRS goes there has only been  entries into the ASRS database involving the mention of a possible drone and aircraft incident from the earliest record recorded in the database. The earliest record of a drone being mentioned in an incident report was .  of these incidents involved military drones all of which were malfunctions only one endangered a civilian aircraft.  of these incidents that were non military occurred before  and involved fixed wing model aircraft only one before  may have involved a black multirotor flying  feet below a LGA KORRY  flying at an altitude of  ft it could have been a black balloon given the description and was not a NMAC.  of the incidents occurred in .Confirmation of article VS. ASRS and FAA documentation in order of appearance. These NMAC incidents involved commercial aircraft on final approach light aircraft and helicopters at altitudes below ft  Confirmed FAA  Confirmed FAA   Confirmed FAA  Confirmed FAA  Confirmed FAA  confirmed FAA  Confirmed FAA  Misleading this was a TCAS alert. The TCAS system to my knowledge is a threefive part system and too large for model aircraft to use practically it was most likely not a drone piloted by a hobbyist and was not a NMAC incident. This should have been omitted from the article. Actual pilot report cross referenced from the ASRS database When cleared for the visual approach to Runway R in EWR at  FT on the way to intercept final multiple targets started to paint on our TCAS between our  to  oclock  FT to  FT below our altitude. Since the Captain was flying and I was monitoring I started to look for those aircraft usually low altitude helicopters. At first I spotted a drone small in size dark gray and very shiny flying south southwest opposite to our direction of flight and it coincided with the direction and altitude of one of the targets on the TCAS. Shortly after I spotted two more of these drones around the same altitude flying also south southwest and they were no factor but I still pointed them out to the Captain. I felt the need to report it to Tower like I would if I saw a flock of birds so the aircraft approaching behind could exercise caution while during their approach. Once upon landing I was given a phone number to explain the shift ATC supervisor what I saw. The question was raised by several people about why a device like a drone would paint on the TCAS as they would also have to have a transponder. I fully understand the operation and capabilities of the TCAStransponder relationship so my only conclusion is that those drones had an operating transponder onboard. After landing during the debrief with my Captain he says he only saw a balloon and he would leave the phone call to ATC to me.    Confirmed FAA    Confirmed FAA   Confirmed FAA  Confirmed FAA  Confirmed FAA  Confirmed FAA  No record based on source  No record based on source     Confirmed FAA  Confirmed FAA .. Confirmed FAA  Confirmed FAA  Confirmed FAA  Can not confirm  Can not confirm  Can not confirm  Only News reports can not confirm legitimacy.In conclusion  sort of not really tldr As much as I wish I could have come back here and told everyone that there is nothing to worry about and this article was just crap I cant. As far as the article goes it is a scare piece crafted to further damage the public perception of our hobby but I believe that the FAAs list is somewhat concerning not primarily because of the incidents but it points toward a potential trend that pilots are basically classifying anything that is in the air that may take on a similar form to a drone a balloon etc. that they can not identify with complete certainty as a drone. Some of the sightings are made  feet away making identifying the object practically impossible unless it falls into the category of a manned aircraft. The FAA also seems to only be releasing a basic synopsis of most of these sightings which means they can easily be taken out of context. The full version of a pilots report may state that they thought it could be a drone but it was most likely a balloon etc. while the FAA synopsis will omitt all evidence pointing to it being anything other than a drone. This became evident to an extent in my search of the ASRS where the pilots in the full description of the event will state that they could not be  sure that it was a drone but the synopsis will label the incident as a drone sightingencounter. This is made even further evident by the  incident information that I posted above. It paints a much different picture from the synopsis that the FAA report showed and the articles copypaste of the FAA information. Stiff regulation or a ban will do absolutely nothing but hurt the pilots that fly responsibly but that is not how the FAA sees it and that is not how their carefully crafted propaganda has shaped public perception. Those who fly irresponsibly would most likely be unaware of any regulations or FAA decisions in the first place. In short as with many kneejerk policy creations bad multirotor pilots are going to continue to be bad multirotor pilots and absolutely nothing will change. The incidents will continue to occur regardless of whatever legislation is in place the technology is just far too cheap and accessible for any amount of regulation to make a dent in any potential incidents especially when considering these incidents are created by irresponsible pilots that wouldnt even take the time to familiarize themselves with the law in the first place.I am sure that there are solutions that can appease nearly everyone. But they as unfortunate as it is will never prevent the malicious or those who do not take the time to educate themselves and act safely from acting as they please.

3473197,0,t1_cpo52jp,The fundamental physics of combining battery packs in parallel hasnt changed and will never change. You asked what parallel charging was and I told you.If two packs are connected in parallel with different voltage current will flow between them proportional to the voltage difference divided by the internal resistance of the cells. Its just Ohms Law. If that current flow is high enough the lowervoltage battery can be damaged because it is being charged at a higher C value than it is rated for. Or you can burn out the traces on your parallel charging board. You can keep downvoting me all you want but it wont make Ohms Law not apply.,radiocontrol,cpo64ip,1,t5_2qmhb

GHz  they retain some value due to the TXs features but even then they dont have as much value as something made for .

9874197,0,t3_5gqzwy,The skywalker mini might be OK because the prop is protected but the wing looks completely straight so it wont level itself. Also the whole thing looks a bit fragile for the abuse itll get while you learn.That said the learning process is different for everyone. If you put in a few hours on a simulator and are luckypatient enough to start on a calm day you could have no crashes until you start to take risks for fun. If you turned up at my club with one Id happy teach you to fly it and would be pretty sure of success but it might not be forgiving enough to teach yourself.A one piece EPP wing like the TekSumo will be tougher but still wont selflevel and are often set up to be quite fast.Then again selfleveling planes are really affected by gusts of wind. Wings with dihedral cant tell the difference between sideslip and a cross wind. Once you can handle a faster less stable plane you can fly it in a more wind.Models like this are cheap and the electronics usually survive crashes and can be transferred when the model is beyond repair so it makes sense to get a dedicated trainer and then upgrade when youre ready. Id be tempted to get two skywalker minis and modify the wing on the first one to have polyhedral to make it super stable.Km is pushing the limits for most RC transmitters but obviously if youre going for autonomous flight that doesnt matter.Have you seen this FPV  Long Range System LRS Shootout | Flite TestYou can get FPV goggles with a quality picture for . More expensive goggles are mainly giving you a smaller more convenient package or a builtin diversity receiver and DVR  items that youd probably replace anyway.Theres not much point displaying the picture on your phone the most basic reversing camera monitors will be just as good and are only about . Charging  the most popular charger for the last few years is the iMAX B Itll do everything but if you get serious you might want a multiport charger which are like  of these in one box. Flight simulators are an excellent way to learn even the free ones or a free demo because you only need a few hours. You can get USB leads for any transmitter that has a buddybox port i.e. anything but the most basic. This appears as a USB joystick to the computer.Finally I highly recommend finding a local club or another pilot to help you. It really helps to have someone check and trim your model before you fly and to grab the controls if you get into trouble or ideally use a buddybox. Flying is a lot more fun in company.,radiocontrol,daumqkn,2,t5_2qmhb

10817113,0,t3_5un5tr,Efficiency is never improved with more motors. The more motors and ESCs you have the more power is turned into heat.Lower kV at higher voltage will be better as well. Less amp draw less heat generated.As to what you need for motorescbattery well that depends a lot on the drag of the airframe and more importantly the wing loading.If the wing loading is very light you can get away with a tiny motor setup.I dont have any direct experience with planes that big so I cant recommend any specifics.,radiocontrol,ddvpj9o,1,t5_2qmhb

Plus being made of EPP rather than EPO will make it quite a bit more durable even without laminating it.

But you can also buy a  brushless rocket that is an absolute weapon and under g.  These rules is going to end up sending a message to some jerk that since his S beast comes in under g he can fly it near peoplecrowds and according to these regulations he wont be in the wrong.Does people include myself or my flying buddies?  Even if not at  meters is an unreasonably long distance.  I cant even hover in the center of a soccorfootball field while a spectator watches on the sidelines.  If you want to race youre going to want to cover  meters for a track which means you need a personless circle with a m radius.

11724778,0,t1_dgo8arn,gt  As far as beginner planes go find out where youre able to fly first. I am thinking I want something mid sized. I absolute want FPV and a camera on it. I am not looking to do everything at once but that would be my end goal. For the next  months at least.gt The sport cub s comes with a small cheapo remote like the vista and the apprentices come with the DXE which is spektrums bottom line controller. The DXE will work well for the plane but its something you want to upgrade in the future.At the store the Sports Club S was one of the planes recommended. That is very encouraging that it is something where I can easily upgrade the radio. which seems to be one of the more expensive pieces. From what I have seen Cosmetically I think I like the Spectrum. That is based entirely on looks though but being one of the main brands I dont think I could go wrong.gt Buying vs buildingI think what might be best is buying something ready to fly out of the box and upgrading as I go along. I am also tempted to simply buy a  foam plane and then get the minimum quality electronics needed to start flying and then getting all the extras I want as I understand more and more.gt Also please please please avoid China direct sites like gear best or bang good.Absolutely I am all about supporting stores and keeping money local.
