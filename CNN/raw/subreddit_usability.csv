99252,0,t1_cepns0o,Culture is hugely team dependent groups here are the size of entire companies in their own right. Even team to team within a specific org matters a lot  the org Im in has a set of clear shared values user first emphasis on design desire for innovation but individual teams have different personalities my team is more thoughtful and introverted another is more boisterous and extroverted. Teams within a discipline seem to be the fundamental unit of social interaction but there is a lot of crossteam collaboration. Wed never get anything done otherwise. Socially designers mostly eat lunch and hang out with the designers in their team PMs hang out with the PMs on their team etc but its very easy to mix if you want to. At this point Id say my work friends are split fairly evenly between design and PM. I also know quite a few people who are on completely different products and my manager has repeatedly told me that this is something Im doing particularly well. So even if interaction across teams doesnt always happen its clearly valued. ,usability,cepqalx,2,t5_2qj1m

Good user testing involves open ended questions like what do you think this means? and what would you expect to happen if you click this?This kind of questioning can tell you why something isnt working rather than just whether or not it works.,usability,cjkxm9n,1,t5_2qj1m

6755247,0,t1_d0hcqat,Imagine this. Drive into underground parking garage with no service park on P. Take elevator to ground floor. Start walking as you open the app wait for phone to get back on network. Press manually end trip.. Wait for server responseBy the time you hit the button you could be several hundred meters from the car and if wifi is off the GPS on your phone could be off by a hundred meters or more so now not only is the car invisible to cargo its half a mile away from where you marked the trip complete.It a city like Toronto it could be parked in a private garage where its being charged  day for parking and there could be ten or twelve underground parking structures within a city block.It doesnt take many  cars going missing to cause your business problems. And here youre letting each user of the system effectively lose two cars a month.When the prize is a free car criminals will get very good at fraudulent identity and register a new account once a month and your security checks will need to be onerous driving away your real users.,usability,d0i1s28,1,t5_2qj1m
