3609319,0,t3_31dc64,My VPSs keep going into read only every week.  I would rather they just turn off and stay powered down then this read only BS so I could at least monitor them.  Ill open a ticket and theyll just close it saying its resolved.  And when the VPS is up im getting horrible IO.  I wouldnt recommend their service to anyone even with the cost.,CloudAtCost,cq3osw8,1,t5_33d7m
3914044,0,t3_31dc64,Just a quick update.I have migrated all my servers to their CloudPro service.  So far I am getting consistent sustained disk IO readwrite performance of mbps.  I have not yet hooked up collectlcolplot as I am working on my puppet automation first.  When I get around to setting up the disk IO monitoring again Ill post another update.Consistency is the key so it will take some time to see if this is a longterm improvement.,CloudAtCost,cr2fpia,1,t5_33d7m
