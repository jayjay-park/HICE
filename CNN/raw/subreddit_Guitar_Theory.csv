10550284,0,t3_5r2qfi,Have you ever tightened a string so much that it snapped? That is typically why you dont tune a guitar much higher than E standard although you can get away with it to a certain extent. It causes too much tension in the strings and it will be harder to play also it will probably throw off your intonation. Similarly if you want to tune really low like C or B you need to have your guitar set up to accommodate the new scale length. Otherwise it will not work how you want. ,Guitar_Theory,dd3zrfm,5,t5_39an0

11488646,0,t3_5s3u2x,When youre playing over a set of chord changes change the pentatonic youre playing to match the current chord.  So for a G C D progression it would be G major pentatonic then C major pentatonic then D major pentatonic.  Transitioning between pentatonics for the different chords leads to some great sounds IMO.  ,Guitar_Theory,dfy8j7f,1,t5_39an0
11617945,0,t1_dgcdw2t,That makes sense but I realize in that there is a C note in the opening lick that he plays. Does that sound good because C is in the G maj scale? And what would you call that scale then? The Em blues scale with an added C?,Guitar_Theory,dgcwkl7,2,t5_39an0
