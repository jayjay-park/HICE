501832,0,t1_cfx91r7,I dont feel bad for Bash. It just would suck of he was written off. Hes a great character and the actor does an awesome job. He actually seems more fitting for this show than the francis actor.  His ragged beard does nothing to make him appear more manly. ,ReignCW,cfxb8is,3,t5_2ytvo
592630,0,t3_20di7g,I laughed out loud at the prospect that King Henry bonked someone right out of a window. Also anyone else here watch GoT and realize that Bash is way too similar to John Snow? Just about everything  but a Mary. He even gets it on with like an outlander type lady next to some roasting pig smells.,ReignCW,cg7mwip,3,t5_2ytvo

5607100,0,t3_3rtz47,Is it just me or sometimes you just get rage at this show because Mary always gets the short end of the stick? Its like there is no end in sight for her suffering. The moment she gets pregnant  bam she loses it! The moment shes back in love with Frances  bam hes dying again. Can we just have like a  episode streak where it doesnt suck to be her?,ReignCW,cws45bs,8,t5_2ytvo
