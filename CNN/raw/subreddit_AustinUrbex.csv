132825,0,t3_1ot51a,Hi! I just stumbled upon this subreddit! Ive been exploring many times over the past few years and am having trouble not only finding people but new locations. Ive scoured the internet on my phone atleast looking for abandonedpossibly haunted places in Austin and they seem to be few and far between especially with all of this new construction. Anyone have any suggestions or must see places?,AustinUrbex,cetk44c,1,t5_2yua0
