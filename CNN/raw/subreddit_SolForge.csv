584146,0,t1_cg6njd4,Id also add that at least in MTG these types of cards are EXTREMELY rare. You very rarely find mythic rare cards that represent planeswalkers. The idea that you can have  of these on the field at a time and they will be as common as other legendaries is very disconcerting. I dont think SB has learned that the game not only needs to be fun to win at but fun to lose at. Playing against decks like that is not fun. It promotes situations like the current meta where you see the same  or  decks every time you play constructed. Its one of the reasons hearthstone is so fun and has such a healthy following. Yeah Ragnaros sucks when he comes out but he doesnt even border on gamebreaking because you can only ever have one in your deck. There is no one card in HS that a deck can almost entirely function on like there are in SF. Same thing with Standard MTG.,SolForge,cg6o6vu,0,t5_2unly

914015,0,t3_24kvcl,For those complaining about how the game has too much variance in this game no it doesnt actually. Solforge is one of the least variant digital trading card game options out there no matter what levelscrew makes you think and the top players can easily boast a win rate higher than the top players in Hearthstone as well as Magic Online. If anything it has too little variance due to the engine design since the engine makes it hard for novice players to have a fighting chance against a more experienced player..You werent terribly specific in the above quote but when you include it in an article about constructed queue and win rates there I am assuming you are referring to constructed queue win rates.If my assumption on constructed queue win rates is right the comparison youre making doesnt make any sense. Youre comparing a ranked ladder to an unranked system that while it does have a small internal match making it does not approach anything close to a ladder match up system. Looking at a sample of  players in solforge tournament queus you have a system that is designed to distribute wins in a manner that gives you  player who s  players who   who   who  and  who s. This of course breaks down when you cant find another player for your search when sitting at  but the general idea still holds. So on average about  of the player base is getting s or better. This is wildly different than a ladder system that is designed to find a place where players are winning  of their matches and rank them according to where they end up on a ladder. Of course match making systems break down at the very top and the players there break the  target but to compare win rates between solforge tournaments and the hearthstone ladder or other similar match making based ladder systems and try to claim a lower variance just doesnt make sense.,SolForge,ch86gxl,9,t5_2unly

2217376,0,t1_cllkxrw,While I do agree that set  suffers from balance problems I disagree with some of the points you made above.  Poison was never a Tier  or  deck in the meta not because of gnomes but because it was always just a fun deck like dinos and aboms.  You probably were successful with it due to your skill level and not so much because the deck itself was powerful enough.Also most of the cards you are listing as problems are not really used except direhound which is way too strong.  Epidemic ebonbound lyria are not really used much in constructed.  Debuffing is the core of what the Nekrium faction does and that shouldnt change in the future.  Its like saying Tempys has too much burn.I also dont find armor that useless.  My favorite deck to play these days is Stautmeisters Pain Train deck which is a basic bots shell with Killion amp Suzy.  Garg SentinelAegis Knight blowouts are still a lot of fun and the deck has a good matchup vs. BQ.  Ive run  in the last  ConQs with the deck.  ,SolForge,cllojsx,1,t5_2unly

It got me nearly an  winrate in the constructed queues a couple weeks ago I made leaderboards with . winrate but that included some Kitfinity. However now its doing terribly in the queues since I cant beat Rage decks. In theory Gargs and Aeronaut dont die to rage but in practice they always do.

Its downside sucks but when you can eat away that much damage per turn and most of the time  for  an opponent with it. You can realize just how good it is. Its also pretty insane with Xithian Shambler because of how much it can grow shambler.For the record Shardplate Mutant was also one of my first legendaries and having played Magic I knew to look at downsides as not always a reason to rule out a card.

2454484,0,t3_2nmxmt,Hmm...I like this take on the Stasis warden deck only have one gauntlet and not willing to craft the rest at double or if try it out. A couple of things jump out at me though. I hope you dont mind some criticismadvice. First is energy surge. You only have Battlebrand to level it. Mystic could enable leveling but then youre using burn spells to get the mystic through and thats not a recipe for success.  You should either have a second way of leveling the surge or replace them with either a card draw creature or another burn spell like flame lance. That leads to my second concern for the deck the spell distribition is off for Flamebreak invoker. Hell only trigger off of shocks Battlebrand and burnout. I know the shock chain is a staple in this type of deck but I feel like there might be a better option than Invoker. For example Aeronaut is awesome and synergize a with your gauntlets. I know you want to draw up to functionally guarantee the chain but if Ghox isnt working then you want something that is a viable plan B. Anyways thats my two thoughts. I may have some more later. ,SolForge,cmf2rv5,1,t5_2unly

2842922,0,t1_cnr87wl,I think charge is the pick here. Not only is it heroic it is the new albeit weaker roar. If you can get a decent board state it can be very effective.Sprout would again be a pick solely for Groot to banish. Pact is the worst scaling of the in faction buff spells or almost as bad a s tempys at least. Plus your distribution is heavily skewed uttera. Tangle would also be a decent pick for some soft gated mobility hate. There is quite a bit of mobility in draft right now and having that as a fall back isnt bad. Wartusk is a solid breakthrough creature and also wouldnt be a bad pick.Blight Witch really needs some buffs to be effective and so when picking I prefer cards that dont require the synergy.  ,SolForge,cnr8l91,2,t5_2unly

Either they eat the oozelings if I can get an early necromoba or dont get played much.Ferocious roar could be something interesting to look into though I do like the regen from verdant good fun if I land it on the necromoebas. Ill try drop an enrage to put one in for now and see how it feels.Ill have a look into the other options you mention definitely. See which I have to try testing out.

3480603,0,t3_304j1z,Ive always wanted Relic Hunter itself to have Breakthrough when it replaced ANYTHING not just Relic Scouts. I dont like the idea of spending two cards to get a big monster that just gets chump blocked until the opponent has some efficient way to deal with it.My greatest annoyance with the card is that its the best way to give other creatures Breakthrough which is a primarily UTERRA ability.,SolForge,cpp0i7v,7,t5_2unly
3501958,0,t1_cpreoc7,Right but that sets up another barrier to entry. As a new player whos just starting youre going to get trounced a few times and then find out in order to avoid that you have to go through a third party set up another account and learn the ins and outs of the ladder there too? If they arent immediately enamored with the game and systems do you think theyre going to stick around to find out about the ladder? A lower barrier of entry means a higher retention of new players.

3626411,0,t1_cq5moac,Im really not over complicating it though changes to even one card can have large repercussions on the overall card pool which is very time consuming. While the bug testing wouldnt be very difficult completing the balance testing would be very time consuming. In the case of Soul Drinker it has a very powerful effect thats balanced out by the small body and not being able to use it in rank . Its a removal spell that leaves behind a strong but fragile body. Removing one of the drawbacks is a very significant change that could have very real repercussions on the card pool. Besides Id much rather have the testing be thorough in regards to changes than just slap a change that could be potentially catastrophic onto a card without testing.,SolForge,cq5mzgs,2,t5_2unly

4279059,0,t1_cs7y3dq,Theres two different questions here. Im at a keyboard now so I can address it in a little more depth.Question one is Strategically how do you deal with Malice Hermit. The answer is by no means limited to Legendaries. Removal means any time you use one card to eliminate another card via special ability and there are many cards that do this. Byzerak Spitemage is heroic so is Dreadbolt. Nanoswarm is rare and so is Sap. Energy Prison is another heroic. There are many many removal cards nearly all of which are gated which means that they only work on cards of equal level. This means that you have to play them every player level to  or they lose effectiveness. So gated removal which is the easy answer to powerful single cards is restrictive of your other play and luck dependent but no it does not rely on Legendaries.The other question is How do you deal with your opponent having a Tier one deck. For this you also need a Tier one deck to have a  winloss ratio over time. Theres no way around that. If you are new to the game most of your opponents will have monster decks. When I started a year ago this was the game I joined and it is actually significantly easier to get your own powerful cards now than when I started. The problem here is not  Hermit but the entire deck that he is part of and you really just need your own in order to beat him half the time.However there are plenty of strong deck configurations that do not need legendaries and can beat your opponents tier one decks sometimes if played with luck and skill. When I started this was enough to interest me until I FPed my own solid decks. If you cant stand losing more than half the time and cant wait to grind your own then either spend money on powerful cards which is fine or find a different game. ,SolForge,cs7yw67,7,t5_2unly

Except if you sell the account seen people trying to do that but not sure if it is really legal and if people really buy this.With all the gold you have and as you dont need tickets the only thing you can do in my opinion is go constructed. By buying cards of the day  gold chests discount gold do the guaranteed legendary WW with gold  gold. With everything bought with gold you can can share it with others against other cards you would need to build the deck you want. I would recommend to go on Kaelaris ladder to see some competitive decks go to completed tournaments and also for trading. You can see havewant lists from other people and find matches for your trades. A last council if I was you I would wait for set to come out before spending your gold. New legendaries will be wanted a lot so it will be much more easy to share against something you really wantneed...If you really dont want to go constructed then I see nothing to do with your gold except buying stuff as mentionned above and give it to people who want the cards to go constructed people like me for instance IGN ghybru Enjoy the game and your gold and once again congrats with your elite tourney!,SolForge,czb1vf5,3,t5_2unly

7713401,0,t3_4kvsmz,So Im trying to figure out how this card plays out over a couple of normal turns in a draft game. Your setup turn Play a creature in open lane Play a creature that makes a token both in open lanesOpponents turn Block two creatures trading with one eating the otherYour Raid turn Attack two creatures die Play Relentless Wanderers in an open lane Play another creature in front of your opponents surviving creature so the new Wanderer wont spawn in front of it Raid triggersBoard stateOpponent One creature in play probably trading with whatever you played in front of itYou Two defensive Relentless Wanderers in open lanes open lane token on the offensive and a normal creature trading with your opponentsOpponents turnHeres the crux turn that decides whether Wanderers runs away with the game or your opponent recovers. If were talking about L Wanderers its pretty easy for them to drop two creatures in front of the Wanderers probably setting up favorable trades since they are understatd. In that case you would need some sort of combat or mobility trick to keep them alive for another Raid trigger. If you dont have a trick the board is basically back to an even state. If they are L or L Wanderers your opponent might have a harder time answering them because they will require on level cards or one of a few under leveled options Burnout Marrow Fiend etc.. If that turn happens to be the turn where they dont draw their leveled cards youre probably going to get a third Wanderer and should be able to ride that advantage to a win. Even if they have on level answers they need to actually beat the Wanderers in combat to avoid the for so s and s.  Also underleveled combat tricks start to get insane value. Think about playing an Enrage that turns the trade on one of the Wanderers and in turn gets you another Raid trigger. That Enrage just cleared a creature kept a damaged creature on board and got you an additional on level full health creature. o.OMoral of the story These probably wont run away with the game in rank  unless you have a lot of combat tricks to keep them alive. At higher ranks they will be very punishing to under leveled draws.edit Actually the opponents play should probably be to just block the attacking token instead of one of the Wanderers to prevent Raid from triggering next turn. This is complicated!,SolForge,d3iylwp,2,t5_2unly

7791664,0,t1_d3rrko2,Im not particularly interested in the economy mechanics of other products. Those might inform the design decisions of Solforge but at this point Im not interested in why theyve changed something but rather whether its an intended change at all.Edit  Just to clarify Im looking for information so I can talk to the people that I got playing the game. The purpose of the post isnt to complain about a feature or discuss the economy update. I just would like some official info.Bottom line a significant number of the people I know that playedplay this game spent a large portion of time just playing vs. AI. If this is no longer a valid way to progress and build a collection I doubt theyll care why the change was made rather theyll care about howif it affects their enjoyment of the game.Edit  I should add that if the rewards for BOTH the first win of the day and the winning  times is an event ticket then it makes for an easier sell. After all its not terribly obtuse to have the requirements for obtaining an item that is meant to be used to play other people be playing other people. That being said the only information Ive found on the Economy Update is regarding to the rewards based on winning  matches not on the First Win of the Day reward so this is purely speculation unless someone can illuminate this Im unable to play matches since Im at work.,SolForge,d3ru9iy,0,t5_2unly

7806492,0,t1_d3thh2k,Standard nek removal only deals with a Lorus that fits its level clause.Dreadbolt and Death Current dont hit a Lorus at level  when your removal is level .Spiritcleave doesnt hit a level  Lorus when youre level . In fact Spiritcleave probably cant even hit Lorus in the first place because hes not the biggest creature on board which is a massive problem when he hits Level  because then you cant kill him period. The problem is that Lorus is becoming level  way too quickly. Him being level  isnt a stats issue the level is the problem. Standard removal revolving entirely around the level of the creatures means that Lorus doesnt care.I can get him to level  before I even hit player level . Thats not okay because that means he dodges a massive amount of removal. Theres currently only one surefire spot removal spell that deals with a Lorus thats going off and thats Grave Pact which nobody plays for good reason. As a result like I said you have to ruin your deck with stuff you wouldnt normally want to play to deal specifically with Lorus. Forcing players to build around countering a single card with every deck isnt healthy design. You either deal with Lorus and get run over by other creatures or ignore Lorus and he hits level  in two turns and you lose. ,SolForge,d3tifs6,-1,t5_2unly
7809270,0,t1_d3ttdec,gt Im not so sure its so easy to trigger raidgt Hes definitely good just not sure hes busted.Except that it IS extremely easy to trigger his Raid as soon as your second turn and Lorus can be Level  as soon as your third turn. If youre on the first play T Lorus T Any  Aggressive creatures Lorus Raid triggers.If youre playing second T LorusSomething else it doesnt matter T  Aggressive creatures to trigger Lorus Raid.The problem with Lorus is that he instantly spirals out of control if youre playing him in an Aggro TempysUterra deck. Instantly.My most common play that basically wins me the game the second someone ignores LorusLorus gt Warhound Raider  Warhound Courser  Instant Raid.You also have to keep in mind that Lorus himself doesnt have to attack to trigger Raid meaning you can just play him into a board state where youd already be attacking with  creatures anyway and then EoT you get Raid. A good UT Lorus deck can consistently get a level  Lorus by the end of Player Level .And by consistent I mean Ive been doing this every single game Ive played with the deck. ,SolForge,d3ttqgr,0,t5_2unly

I dont need to know their finances to know that this is possible.In addition losing a nonzero number of paying players also has a total value which is unknown in the context of other changes.What IS known is that offline rewards cost but do not directly benefit the publisher.

7944930,0,t3_4o2obc,As someone who came into this game also from mtgif that wasnt obvious  I can definitely see where youre coming from. However as you mention there are no resource restrictions in solforge just number of cards you play. My tactic for building with solforge follows as such Im no pro and theres very likely better advice out there but its the way I do it. I start by coming up with a card I want to build around or a several card combo to build around. Next I think about how I want the deck to win the game a big bomb late game Big dumb animals etc. Third find solid supporting backup cards cards that function nicely with your earlier decisions. At this point you should have  cards in the deck. I usually have  or  underdropsremoval and about five flex  spots to fill with meta game hate right now some sort of botanimate effect or something along with some arbiters or leylines. Some general tips activated abilities need to be very very good to be good in constructed. A lot of the lower rarity activated abilities are just never going to be worth it. It needs to be something like Marty mcgear or xerxes to be worth it unless you have ator. Also be wary of solbind I personally wouldnt play a deck with more than  extra cards unless its just for fun the extra variance involved makes the deck much less consistent and usually doesnt make up for it in power when its more than a single bind. Also before you finish the deck make sure to check for any sort if faction needs if youre playing an allied card you want at least around  of that faction. If youre playing patrons you want max  or  off color cards some people would kill me for saying that  off faction is the normal. Try playing every kind of deck you can and then try to make changes. Try categorizing each card to see a net decks makeup into categories like underdrops finishers removal etc to give yourself gouges for how much certain decks use over others. Hope this helps you a bit! ,SolForge,d4931ud,4,t5_2unly

8348398,0,t1_d5l2km4,Diabolist acts essentially as a free card against any non Tempys deck.If she is removed with a spell its a  for  with no gain on either side. This is going to be the worst case scenario except against aggro  Ignir which I wouldnt recommend playing her against.If she is not removed she first has a free body free blocker with also chip damage help proc Necroplasm poison her to buff Malice Hermit dendrify her if theres nothing better to doShe allows you to play multiple cards the next turn Discard effects loaded up on the same turn potentially wreck enemy turn Playing three bodies on a turn helps set up a Necroplasm on a more efficient space More stuff is leveled up. Yes she is one of the cards leveled up but she is proactive so improves consistency. Minor card combos enabled like double hive hermit or removal ordering stuff.I find Diabolist to be a core part of the deck its hard to give examples of what she enables but she creates a lot of advantage that builds up faster than something like Killion and Esperian Sage.Thanks for the Grave Pact idea that is goddam genius,SolForge,d5l3pa5,1,t5_2unly

8578826,0,t1_d6d9el8,I get that but again it doesnt really say much about strategy other than play legendaries until I win.  I dont hate the guy its fine and Id do it too if I had the option.  My point is that a week into the game I have no chance to beat that because I dont even know thats a thing. So far my big losses are all due to being overwhelmed by legendary cards. I am torn because A. I think if you pay more money into a game than I do you deserve a better shot at winning B. All ccgs are really about building legendary or rares to win C. It sucks that even casuals are thrown against such high powered decks and doesnt really do much to build a playerbase who is willing to lose for weeks to even come close to winning reglurly. I never had this issue with Hearthstone but a few others Ive tried are the same way... and i no longer play them. I am hoping that this game turns out to be different because I love the system.,SolForge,d6dxrcy,1,t5_2unly
