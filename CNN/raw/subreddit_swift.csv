1146741,0,t3_2793kd,Im not sure anybody knows enough about Swift yet to tell you if its a good language to be your first learning experience. I would wager that its actually not a good language right now  for learning specifically  because aside from the free ebook that Apple just released there are nearzero resources about programming Swift.This reddit will start collecting a lot of those resources but again because Swift is not yet a mature language a lot of these tutorials are going to show things that wont be best practice in a year or two.Plus Swift is just the syntax. The majority of the APIs you will deal with the nouns and verbs effectively will be Cocoa and all the Cocoa documentation currently has examples in ObjectiveC. So learning Swift will probably mean at least learning to read ObjectiveC. Not a show stopper  but if its your first time out its going to add some complexity to your learning.All that being said you said one thing in particular you are specifically interested in iOS programming. Swift is definitely the language of the future for iOS development.Also in the plus column is the Playgrounds feature of Xcode that only works with Swift. Thats definitely going to help you get learning the language quickly  it really reduces the amount of time it takes to see if your code does what you think.So. There are challenges learning Swift as a first language but there are also upsides. If youre committed I think its doable. But if youre looking to learn at your own pace and dont have a lot of time per session less than a few hours at a time to spend on learning then Id go with something much more mature and documented.,swift,chymd9f,13,t5_2z6zi

2326367,0,t3_2ly5sj,gt You guys Love it or Hate it and why?I havent built a fully featured app with it though will be soon but Im loving it. When I successfully write a generic function I feel like lord supreme badass programmer of the world. Strong type checking can be frustrating but it prevents stupid assumption making and allows the compiler to catch lots of problems. When Im back in objectivec land I find myself really missing small features like mapfilterreduce though Ive just ended up writing my own extensions.Only thing I really dislike are the lack of header files. It would be fine if there was a shortcut in XCode to only view a class public declarations. But theres nothing I can find. I really really really hate this.gt What makes it so much better than ObjC?I wouldnt say SO MUCH BETTER but it has better type checking and good compiler type checking and type inference. Switch statements and enums wassociated values are way more powerful. Generics are awesome. Closures are way better than blocks. Freely passing functions around comes with a lot of benefits and will hopefully make ReactiveCocoa bearable to use. gt Thinking further in the future what makes it so superior?Eventually new cocoafoundation APIs will only be available in swift. ,swift,clz93gx,2,t5_2z6zi

Otherwise the only thing you need to watch out for is where the midpoint is further away from  which means its not continuous at that point so you go back to the start and pick another pair of points.Otherwise you keep iterating to the level of desired precision.But as has already been pointed out there are also an infinite number of solutions to the particular equation you posted.e.g. x  y  z  . is a trivial solution,swift,crkpfki,1,t5_2z6zi

With some clarity as to the direction Material is going I feel that everyone will be happy using it. Material is a graphics and animation framework. We made it look like Material Design quite easily. The framework is not meant only for MD it is possible to make it look like anything and we plan on showing people how to use the components for both iOS native look and feel and MD look and feel. The main benefit aside from the look one chooses to use is the ease of making components. Beginners have a lower barrier to entry and experts no longer need to write common code over and over again. So hopefully everyone will be happy with what we do as we are thinking of MD fans and native iOS fans. All the best and I appreciate the feedback. Thank you! ,swift,czk9d3j,4,t5_2z6zi

6883397,0,t1_d0wgmk9,When using a scrollview with auto layouts the best practice is as follows Create scrollview Add UIView inside it that has  distance to the edges fills it For vertical scroll set the width of the UIView inside the same as the scrollview. This makes sure the content of the view is the same size as outside so the scrollview knows what size the cgrect should be All content should be added inside the main UIView inside the scrollview and connect from top to bottom.For a horizontal scroller just do the same but for the height instead of the width. If you want to have three screens width of scrolling make the width of the inner UIView the same width as the UIScrollView with a multiplier of  or  and the height the same as the scrollview.Just try to experiment maybe in a new empty view controller from scratch instead of adding really complex things immediately.

7109469,0,t3_4cwza2,No that seems pretty good. Coming from Haskell we see stuff like that somewhat often. We prefer to use the State monad though. But Swift doesnt really have a good way to represent computations like this with a monad like State.    struct StateltS Tgt         let runState S gt T S        func getStateltSgt gt StateltS Sgt         return StateltS Sgt  s in s s         func putStateltSgts S gt StateltS gt         return StateltS gt   in s         extension State         func fmapltUgtf T gt U gt StateltS Ugt             return StateltS Ugt  s in                let newS t  self.runStates                return newS ft                                    func applyltUgtfState StateltS T gt Ugt gt StateltS Ugt             return StateltS Ugt  s in                let newS f  fState.runStates                return self.fmapf.runStatenewS                            static func ofltS Tgtt T gt StateltS Tgt             return StateltS Tgt  s in s t                 func flatMapltUgtk T gt StateltS Ugt gt StateltS Ugt             return StateltS Ugt  s in                let newS t  self.runStates                return kt.runStatenewS                        So while we have a useful definition of state itll be pretty ugly to use especially without do notation. In Haskell we could write this function quite nicely like so.    reduceState  a gt a gt b gt State s a gt b gt State s a    reduceState a f   return a    reduceState a f xxs  do        newA lt f a x        reduceState newA f xs         Use case    finalState reduced  runState reduceState initialA f .. initialState        where            f a x  do                s lt get                let s a  doSomething s a x                put s                return aIn Swift its going to look something like this.    extension Array         func reduceStateltS Agtinitial A f A Generator.Element gt StateltS Agt gt StateltS Agt             var reduced StateltS Agt  State.ofinitial            for elem in self                 reduced  reduced.flatMap  a in                    return fa elem                                        return reduced                 Use case    let finalState reduced  ..lt.reduceStateinitialA  a elem in        return getState.flatMap  s in            let newS newA  doSomethings a elem            return putStatenewS.flatMap   in                return StateltS Agt.ofnewA                        .runStateinitialStateSo while the actual implementation of reduceState doesnt look so bad the use case looks absolutely awful in Swift.This isnt all that useful on its own anyway. Why use a State monad when we can just manually thread a state variable through the function? Well in Haskell its because we can make this function work with any monad not just State.    reduceM  Monad m gt a gt a gt b gt m a gt b gt m a    reduceM a f   return a    reduceM a f xxs  do        newA lt f a x        reduceM newA f xsAnd now this would Just Work with the State monad or any other. But in Swift this isnt possible because we dont have higher kinded types. So in Swift we can only implement this as reduceState and have it be confined to the State monad.Because it cant be more general and because the use case code is so ugly Id recommend not using a State monad for this task. While its very elegant and Monadic in theory in practice Swift just doesnt support making monadic code easy to write or read. Its not worth the trouble if you cant generalize it to all Monads which you cant.Conclusion being your current implementation is probably the best youre gonna get,swift,d1m8lc9,5,t5_2z6zi

8703627,0,t1_d6t8ugm,Yeah when you dont actually spell out parameters at the start of the closure you can use  and  if there is a second parameter as there is in reduce functions  starts as the initial value and  is the member of the array that you are adding or more specifically reduceing to it. Although xcode always seems to try and make me write . and ..So in this case I said I want to reduce self self is an array where element conforms to numeric and I want the initial value to be two doubles in a tuple. I could have given them parameter names in the closure  T Double Double nextElement Element gt DoubleDouble in ..... But because reduce knows its looking for two parameters already and it knows the types you dont have to. They call it an anonymous closure.  In this case  is the initial value so it has . and . where as  is just the one value of type Element. It took me a while to figure this out but it certainly makes life easier and saves you from all those for in loops when youre manipulating data.flatmap is fun too. I just wrote this line    let typesRepresented  completedReadings.flatMap.readingTypes.flatMap.uniquethe first flatmap removes all the readings that that have nil for their reading types which is an optional array. The second flatmap connects all the arrays into one long array. Although its better to write this as completedReadings.flatMap.readingTypes ?? .uniquefinally unique was this great little extension that I saw on stackoverflow    extension Array where Element Hashable         var unique Element             return ArraySetself            ,swift,d6tl50u,2,t5_2z6zi

9059594,0,t1_d80ng37,They are to me  of the time.  I think its a problem that to Swift theyre not.  In lots of other languages including many which Swift plundered for ideas theyre not.When I learned the Pythagorean Theorem in school I didnt have to learn it once for little numbers and then again for mediumsized numbers and a third time for big numbers.  I learned it once and I can use it for any numbers.  Junk like hypothypotlhypotf was a necessary hack because of the way C works but by any other metric its not good design.Think about characters.  In C if you wanted something like append string A and string B you had to know the encoding of each.  If they were both char you used strcatA B.  If they were both wchart you used wcscatA B.  If they were not the same well tough!  In Swift once Ive got a String I dont generally need to worry about how its stored in memory.  I can write the behavior that I want like A  B and the runtime makes it happen.  I can peek under the covers when I want more control but  of the time I dont.Heres the analogyBad old days of C string.h has  versions of everything str functions and wcs functions.  Good new days of Swift unified set of string methods for one String class  worry about storage in memory only when you need toBad old days of C math.h has  versions of everything f d and no suffix functions  Good new days of Swift ...still have to think about this crap,swift,d80tg2t,1,t5_2z6zi

As a power user graphics pro Ive been trying to deal with exactly that type going on  years now and theyre the reason I finally rolled up my sleeves and taught myself to software myself cos its the only way I could make sure the jobs done right and never have to deal with such arrogant insecure martinet assholes again. Its taken me a fuckload of hard work to learn how to it myself it too cos Im not a natural at this crap but Ive done it anyway and my good software has stomped their bad software into extinction as a result. And the  reason why my work has succeeded is because I know how to can my ego listen to my users every time they tell me my work sucks goats and genuinely thank them to for all their time and trouble and assistance in making it right. Users may not know or like me as a person but they fucking adore what the tools I build for them empower them to do...Meantime millions of socalled professional programmers who cant take criticism from their own usersthe real domain expertswithout throwing a ginormous shitfit in their diapers are the single biggest fucking blight on this whole benighted cowboy fuckup industry and the  cause of why so much of the worlds software today not only fails to solve users original problem but shits a whole Imperial fuckload of excitingly inventive new problems all over them too.

10507070,0,t3_5qg2vb,. It is saved as XML in Main.storyboard or any xib file so Swift automatically builds it up for you.. For small apps in development or gaining traction just start with a free tier from the many cloud foundries out there like Heroku Google Cloud Bluemix AWS etc. and use the language of your choice but if youre adventurous go with Swift all the way. For the less adventurous go with prebuilt cloud storage like CloudKit Realm Firebase etc.. Stay hungry stay foolish. And have fun doing what you love..,swift,dcz361v,2,t5_2z6zi

10601996,0,t3_5rouy4,For the function multiplyxy what do you return when it cant be computed by the computer without optionals?That is the key point of optionals.Optionals are enums where you either have a value or dont and if you have a value it can be any value the type can hold. This type of return value is essential for single return ring functions i.e. that dont return a tuple and the value returned is of the same type as the inputSo functions like multiplyxy are all over and by the inclusion of optionals to solve them we can chain failures as well as success. This allows us to greatly lessen our boilerplate error handling.if let is  one of the worst ways to use optionals.let aNonOptionalValue  aPossiblyNilValue ?? ADefaultValue is a way to always get an answer that is a nonoptionalguard if let foo  foo else  return nilstuff you want to do assuming everything is rightLets you write nonconditional code about the main logic of your application and lets you handle the bad cases of foonillet bar  aDeep?.object?.heirerarxhy?.ofOptionals lets you let all the many ways something can fail fall away and one line of code can replace .let bat  anOptional.flatmapaFunctionYouOnlyWantToPassAnOptionalToIfNotNil is also key you get nil if anOptional is nil nil if the functionCall returns nil and otherwise a usedul value.Optionals are one of the best features of Swift. You should be love love loving them and hopefully learning those loving uses.,swift,dd9ijqr,10,t5_2z6zi

11031838,0,t1_deie3kd,HTH Hope That Helps and AMA Ask Me AnythingOnce you connected your buttons the next step was storage as I said. Lets simplify the info you want to present and save to just a date a month and an event nothing else for now. And lets say you want to save it all in a database but it could easily be saved in text files too as long as you name them using the date like events.txt that way you can go forward and backward whenever you press a button in your app. the same way in your database you will Select  from events Where month  mm and year  yy in order to get only the events for that month.Have you done anything in the storage side yet?,swift,deifmfl,2,t5_2z6zi

11464411,0,t1_dfsk27k,Sorry off the top of my head seems like thered be one of those acronym things for that phrase OTTOMH? i can both think of no reason and think of  reasons why that could happen!  As Sherlock says it is a mistake to theorise without data.  All I can say is this seems like one of the thousand of typical nonsense things that can happen when programming.  My best advice would be learn how to debug.  Not simply how to use the debugger although that is important but how to reason about how the code is working and form theories about what is happening and how it could go haywire.  And then learn how to figure out the best way to test your theory to prove or disprove it.  Above all be organised dont just go off in a  directions and set breakpoints and print out all kinds of messages in my experience that just leads to confusion.,swift,dfvhfso,1,t5_2z6zi

11568591,0,t1_dg73uci,gt The thing about guard that kills me is its an early exit. I get thats acceptable in a GC env but thats a leak waiting to happen in a manual mem mgmt env.Guards are normally found at the top of methods so thats not normally something you even have to think about.  And when you do thats what defer is for which you should be using in that case regardless of whether or not you are using guards.gt good form dictates that functions have one entry point and one exit point.Thats really not true.If you really want to avoid multiple exit points in this way then Swift isnt the language for you  youve got to avoid pretty much any language with exceptions.,swift,dg7b03i,2,t5_2z6zi
