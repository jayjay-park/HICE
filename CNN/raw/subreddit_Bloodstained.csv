4047216,0,t1_crhlcig,And if there is competitive multiplayer in Bloodstained I would imagine that the equipment loadout of characters would be limited to facilitate fair play.  Im talking about where one player gets a competitive advantage over another through exclusive content.  ,Bloodstained,crhm3rj,3,t5_386tn
4186067,0,t3_38s70h,Itd be nice but wed need one hell of a last week rush to get there so Im not counting on it. On the other hand something like reaching the . mil for the third playable character feels plausible well easily get to  mil just by keeping up current pace and last week spike is a thing,Bloodstained,crxew9q,5,t5_386tn

4234093,0,t3_39f0h5,Id like some more clarification myself. Is it just a mode where you play through random rooms like the secret worlds in Axiom Verge? Do you die in one hit and lose everything you may have earned? If its like your suggestion where youre basically just playing through the game normally but with random rooms I would probably play it. If its more along the lines of a completely different type of game then I probably wont even play it. I really just want to play another Castlevanialike game.,Bloodstained,cs2vhwx,2,t5_386tn

10009417,0,t1_dbc4s7o,I think there will only be a backlash if Koji Igarashi cancels Wii U and refuses to refund Wii U backers. If Wii U backers are refunded there should not be backlash from reasonable people. In fact most Wii U backers who plan on buying NS want Bloodstained Ritual of the Night on the NS instead.,Bloodstained,dbc97yn,1,t5_386tn
