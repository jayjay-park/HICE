6574800,0,t1_czz95ki,I believe that urezoons was referring to the whole SpaceChem folder.  There is a hidden file called .locals within the SpaceChem folder.  It is what remembers the ingame profiles and keeps track of the correspondence between each ingame profile and its save file.  To restore your old profile youll need to move the .locals file along with the save file most easily done by moving the whole SpaceChem folder.  To prevent the Steam sync feature from overwriting the old .locals file with the later one you created on the new computer I think youll also have to temporarily disable the Steam sync feature or switch Steam offline while you introduce the old .locals file and first play with it to update its lastmodified date.It might be easier just to rename a copy of your old save file as .user substitute it for the new .user and play under your new profile.  Once again however youd need to prevent Steam from overwriting the older save file.I imagine that after you deleted the .user file it was redownloaded from the Steam cloud.  What I dont understand is why the old .locals file was not downloaded from the Steam cloud when you first connected to Steam on the new computer before you created a new .locals file by opening SpaceChem.  Did you perhaps do that while offline?,spacechem,czze04w,1,t5_2s83y
11719483,0,t1_dgix397,Ok so I want to ask for a bit of advice since I was wondering if what Im doing is a valid method. So I cant exactly figure out how to make my reactor give out one element at the same rate as the other since the input ratio is  and this always crashes my second reactor due to collision between molecules . So as a pseudo solution to ensure that theres always the low probability element available with the high probability element I just built very very long pipelines for the high probability element so as to ensure that theres always some of the low probability element in the pipeline for the second reactor. Would this be considered cheating as in its something thats looked down upon or is it a valid method. Im basically following the anything goes as long as it gets the job done method,spacechem,dgofk7v,3,t5_2s83y
