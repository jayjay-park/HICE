2972,0,t1_ceer0zv,You know what punishes overextension?EVERYTHING!!! So stop this argument already. There are hundreds of ways you can punish a player who places too much of his hand on the field.But with Big eye not only do you deal with the treat you gain a massive boost. Which is what makes it broken due to how easy it is to  summon these days.Now this would all be fine if Big beatsticks was all that was taken. But Big eye takes everything. Important facedown monsters stolen. Midrange monsters Stolen. Highly resilient monsters normally immune to effects stolen. Because nothing in the meta can protect itself from a take control effectShut up Felgrand!. And that is why this card is broken.,yugioh,ceeryhy,5,t5_2rpe6

7628,0,t1_cefavwg,Hey thanks!  Well Ive got a budget of about  bucks currently although on DN I guess I have no budget haha.  The main deck I was trying to go for a quick powered up RedEyes Darkness Dragon with a lot of options for getting dragons summoned and in my grave yard or doing damage.  The magic and trap cards were for protecting the weaker cards.  The side deck tries to do the same thing but with different cards to try and throw off someone who would lock down all my dragons.  Im not too interested in getting a brand new deck as Im not going for super competitive but if you could help me with making a deck sort of like what Ive got that would be awesome and much appreciated.,yugioh,cefazh7,1,t5_2rpe6

Then add effects to the cards that bolster each other if the monster used to summon them was a synchro monster from within the archetype.

Bring spore back using his eff making him level  use  tokens to overlay into Catastor then if i want use him and birdman to make the Synchro into level  thus giving me a Level  Synchro and a  Tytannial which can use its effect and a Meliae in  turn.  ,yugioh,cf3afy2,1,t5_2rpe6

I think some other cards should be hit but we are talking specifically about the top tier decks more specific top  Atlanta IMO and ARg Nashville. I would personally love to see a hit on Floodgates that cross the line on degeneracy ie Skill Drain  Kaiser  Etc things that explicit state you cannot play yugioh. I think konami putting soul macro d Fissure andalongside raioh to one was the most intelligent thing theyve done they allowed decks to use there graveyard and not scoop it up vs MacroFissureRaiOh starts. Im going to remind everyone here that if fire Fist had been around in DinoRabbit format the deck would be irrelevant it would have autolosses to Dolkka MacroFissure. The same thing can be said about Mermails dragons not so much but we must understand that the game becomes a lot better and more defined when the broken floodgates are gone. Overworked for example is a good designed card that uses a persons skill it is meant to hit a specific scenario and does it well without as many repercussions but it does not endlessly stay on the field such as Rivarly of warlordsgozen match that do not allow your opponent to even attempt to play yugioh.

300979,0,t3_1xjdvt,So I play a traptrix deck running Mist Valley Falcon and Blackwing Zephyros. Returning continuous spells and traps works very well and can lead to some very cool combos. I dont know which card youre using to bounce but Ill give some suggestions based on my own experience.Mist Valleys probably the most versatile. Opponent summons Wolfbark? Chain fiendish and on your turn attack with mist valley and return fiendish to keep card advantage. Even if he has forbidden lance Falcons effect is activated when you declare attack so you still keep your fiendish.Opponent have a big monster on your opponents field? Safe zone that sucker and declare attack with Mist Valley. You pop their monster keep safe zone and you can then replay to attack directly for  or attack a different monster.Have a dead call of the haunted after XYZ summoning? Attack with Mist Valley and bounce the sucker back to use again for another XYZ next turn.Want to special summon or use spells but dont want to kill your vanitys? Bounce it back to your hand to reuse by attacking with Mist Valley. Keep it for another use and it becomes a .I dont think tenki combos as well with Falcon or other bouncing effects. With Fire Fists you need the normal summons so Falcon is a bit wasteful unless you have another card in mind. Also the faceup Fire formation cards are often used for the effects of the monsters and can only be used once per turn so really bouncing them back isnt good enough to consider replacing fire fist cards for bouncing cards.Call of the Haunted is a great with Zephyros too. Say you have a level  in the grave and Zephyros in hand or the other way around. Call of the haunted on whichevers in the grave summon the other XYZ detach Zephyros for XYZ effect bounce back call and summon Zephyros and reset call. A  even after XYZ summoning. This is a sick sick combo thats very easy to pull off.Although you might not be thinking of these you may want to think about monsters you can bounce too. Though usually you dont want to waste a normal summon if you bounce back something like Madolche Magileine or Traptrix Myrmeleo you can get an extra search. A  at the cost of tempo. Usually not the best choice but definitely an option.,yugioh,cfbynmf,2,t5_2rpe6

358816,0,t1_cfhy3w7,I wouldnt say the Pendulum mechanic is complex it can be summarised as so. Pendulum Monsters act as regular monsters but can be placed in one of two new Pendulum zones where they become Spells.. Pendulum Monsters have two Pendulum Numbers.. You can also place them in your opponents Pendulum Zone to disrupt their strategy.. When two Pendulum Monsters are occupying your Pendulum Zones you can send them to the Extra Deck faceup to Pendulum Summon a type of Special Summon a number of monsters from your Hand or a number of Pendulum monsters from your Extra Deck.. The monsters summoned have to be Levels between the two adjacent Pendulum Numbers. So this means that putting a Pendulum Monster in either the Right or Left zone matters.Its more detailed than Synchro or Xyz but not complicated. I wrote this from memory after reading it when it was first announced. Players arent going to forget it or be confused by it once theyre introduced to it and give it a go. Its pretty straightforward.If Xyz AND Synchro monsters were both searchable boss monsters then why do you need Xyz monsters? Why not stick with Synchro monsters?

378037,0,t1_cfjx6fw,Duality is a really fantastic card in this deck and double cyclone is a pretty great card but suffers from the biggest thing holding artifacts back that theyre primarily reactionary. Ive only made C once but it was very much worth it when I did basically winning me the game. Even without his revival overlaying an opponents monster and having  ATK is no joke. And yeah rank s are a damn good toolbox so Artifacts have a pretty good agro game. I dont dip into the extra deck much so I feel I can afford to throw C in there even if he does require  monsters. Beag is certainly a key player in the deck no doubt about that. I guess with my smaller monster lineup though I just have fewer opportunities where I need Beag right away.And yeah Absorbing jar is a controversial card no doubt about it. I think duality really helps me pick up Jar sooner in the game which is when hes most needed and when his being destroyed hurts the least. Ive seen far too many duelists play as if Jar is the only way to destroy your artifacts which is just awful playing in my books.

Harpies Feather Duster Same thing for spelltraps   Monster Reborn In nearly every duell there will be monsters. Monster Reborn lets you use the best one of those that have been played.   Pot of Greed Card draw! YES!   Delinquent Duo Your opponent gets rid of  cards. That really hurts!   Confication Nearly the same as duo but your opponent only looses one card. BUT you also get to see your opponents hand thats huge.   Change of Heart There will most likely be monsters having one more while your opponent has one less is pretty good. No restrictions? Excelent!   Gracefull Charity Going through your deck getting the cards you need. No really harsh downside? Thats pretty much your whole setup right there   The Sixth Sense more card draw? A lot of cards? YES!the following cards I would also consider to be good in a vacuum but that is actually debateable since you need a tuner in order to get a synchro monster but as long as there are no special requirements I dont actually feel like thats a hindrance same thing as needing a lightampdark monster for Envoy of the end Goyo Guardian A generic synchro monster which has huge attack and the option to also steal your opponents monster.

Why? Pandemic already does the same thing that Lance does and has no ATK cost. Dress protects you against targetingdestruction spellstraps which can include Bottomless Trap Hole for example.  Allure of Darkness. More of than not for me this was completely useless.  Infestation Infection. The card is searchable and unless you see it getting destroyed all the time you only need one.  Evilswarm Bahamut. Bahamut is really really useful. And if your opponent knocks one out or banishes one you have no backup.  Gagaga Cowboy. You only need one.  Evilswarm Ouroboros. Want to banish from their grave? Check. Want a free CED? Check. Want to randomly discard one of those last two cards in their hand? Check.I also suggest adding  ! Dark Illusion as well. The deck is all about keeping your best cards out there. Not to mention the card actually destroys stuff. So if a targeting monster effect such as Big Eye goes after one of your monsters not only are you protected but that card is now destroyed.,yugioh,cfrqcs8,3,t5_2rpe6

509100,0,t3_1zyf0v,Right to start off youll need one more structure deck. This is because there are certain cards from the deck that you will need  of.For monsters you obviously need  Cyber Dragon whichever art you wish as well as  !Cyber Dragon Core and  !Cyber Dragon Drei.  !Cyber Valley is good for stall and can banish Cyber Dragons so !Cyber Network can get them back. Also consider  !Cyber Eltanin which can set up Network and clear your opponents field. Finally as its a LIGHT deck !Honest is great but hes not that cheap. Any other tech is up to you but I wouldnt run much more than what you have there.For Spells !Cyber Repair Plant is a must play at  cause it searches your Cyber Dragons and other LIGHT Machines. !Machine Duplication can bring out  Cyber Valleys and can pull  regular Cyber Dragons from the deck off of one Cyber Dragon Core. Its a common so wouldnt set you back too much. Obviously Limiter Removal is great for OTK pushes so the  you are allowed is fine.  Mystical Space Typhoon as standard but can also be used on your own Cyber Network for maximum sack. Depending on how much Fusion you want to do run as many !Power Bond as you want but be aware of the drawbacks.For Traps A bit of everything you have in the structures is fine with  D Prisons semilimited  Trap Stun for those OTK pushes  Cyber Network. I wouldnt run Three of a Kind or Cybernetic Hidden Technology because they require having more Cyber Dragons than you normally have. If you have some of the old structure decks think  or older they have a card called !Reckless Greed which can get you your combo pieces faster. It does skip Draw Phases though so its a preference card.For the Extra Deck  !Cyber Dragon Nova is good along with  Cyber Twin Dragon and maybe a Cyber End Dragon if you can pick one up. !Shark Fortress is a Common Rank  from LTGY so is super cheap as well as !Tiras Keeper of Genesis who is in Battle Pack . Again the rest of the Extra is up to you run one Rank  some Rank s and s and maybe try to find a !Chimeratech Overdragon with Overload Fusion or !Chimeratech Fortress Dragon to fit in.Remember to try it our on DN or YGOPro before investing in cards that might cost you a lot of money.

514160,0,t3_200p61,Okay I have some experience with this deck so heres a few tips.Do not run Monki. He is a crap version of Lio. Hes a level  and that clashed with everything else this deck does. Without Elephan hes useless.Run  Beast King Barbaros and  TradeIn. Alongside  Elephan and  Cannon you have a stupid amount of draw power.Next max out on Call of the Haunted and run Redox. This gives you grave control which is a nessissary force if you want to win. Ditching Barbaros for a TradeIn then using Redox to resummon him is great.Something fun to do to open up the versitility of the deck is to run  Swift Scarecrow good on its own and  Masked Chameleon. Why? Masked Chameleon will have  targets Gearframe and Scarecrow and open you to Level  and Level  Synchro Naturia Beast??Finally given the mosnter lineup of  Machinas  Super Defense Robos  Barbaros and Redox  more if you go Swift and Chameleon you have a main deck of  monsters. Fit in as much backrow as you can because this deck needs to stun and stop the opponent over and over until you can get your plays off. A first turn LioElephan is great but never count on it.Good luck! I love this deck myself and Im glad to see others interested in trying to make it work.,yugioh,cfypop5,2,t5_2rpe6

516710,0,t3_2012oz,I do feel you left out something crucial for anyone trading.You can always walk out or say no to a deal. Some cards you find might be nice to have but if it feels like youll be losing out on it or even if you see the binder has nothing you really want you can walk away. As for value online prices and store prices vary but think about what YOU hold it as a value. If I got a ultimate rare Powerbond I wouldnt value it more than  as for what I would personally pay for it. Yes its closer to    but Im not going to use it and Im taking a risk in finding out if there is someone wanting the card at that value. So if a card seems way out on price than what you dont want there is nothing forcing you to buy or sell it at that price.As for a binder. I like to sort them by Holo and non holo binders. I also basically put any card i dont need or have nostalgic value on in the binder. Aqua spirit jumped to  from the probably . from when I put the card in. It was a surprise when I got a comment how I usually have older cards and I became the only one with three copies and he needs it way more than I ever wanted it.  But if I made the binder purely out of my top  pages it would have gone by the way side and I would have lost the trade. Yes it takes more time to look at the binder but i feel its better than having to have them sit in a box at home or even worse throw them in the garbage can.,yugioh,cfz0578,2,t5_2rpe6

Also with cards like symbols of duty and creature seizure added you can steal your opponents monsters. The issue with the deck though is the initial normal summoning of Gemini monsters.

Same goes for dark bribe gishki are ment to remove you opponents resources not give them new ones there are much better cards to run over bribe that do not help your opponent.

732073,0,t1_cgnetp2,Both gravekeepers and blackwing play very similar in this format I believe. But after testing gravekeepers I felt that the deck didnt really have a Boss Monster or something to topdeck into mid to late game which in my opinion is where the deck starts to fall apart. Also GK will seem to play at a very slow pace the entire game which I think is bad. BW on the other hand play slowly but can make a very large push at any given time because of there ability to keep summoning. BW side deck is also so much more versatile than what most people might think. People would side in mistakes Dfissure macro in on me game  and it honestly doesnt really hurt at all. Last format I sided all those cards as well. To sum up what Im saying is BW game  vs GK game  will indefinitely be better but with access to alot of format hating cards that people dont think you can run game  and  will be even better whereas GK game  or  will be struggling to keep.    ,yugioh,cgnho4r,2,t5_2rpe6

755675,0,t3_22si4o,Apologies in advance for the wall of text I rambled for quite a bit by accident I feel that Inzektors are a deck that basically need to stall the game out until they reach that point that they just go Summon Dragonfly response? and then extend the hand. Having cards to go off quicker doesnt matter if you either cant get your combos off OR they already have such a big field that they can get round your combos and you cant OTK. Inzektors arent good at making a strong softlock field or anything like that when you go off you pretty much have to win the game or have enough backrow to ensure you reach next turn with your field intact.I personally play a largely different build to this with more backrow and just draw power to get my stuff triple Cardcar triple Upstart and triple Reckless lets you see your good cards as soon as possible and also removes the need to run cards like Summoner Monk and Heart of Clear Water which are only good in specific situations.I would suggest getting Lances ASAP I personally max out on them because I love it but you can easily just play two if youre not a fan of three.Onto what to change Im not going to just say play my build its better because I respect that Inzektors have loads of different ways to play. That said I would definitely recommend removing Heart of Clear Water as its somewhat inconsistent and maxing out on Cardcars and Reckless. You deckthin so much with draw cards and Centipede that youre bound to see multiple Reckless.I dont think Veilers very good in the main deck because it doesnt really touch any of the Dragon variants besides specific things that Fiendish and Breakthrough both do better.Nearly forgot to say max out MST. You need it to stop Fiendish potentially get your effects going and so on.Im not sure on what numbers Ive suggested in this post as Ive been rambling too much but Id suggest playing TorrentialCompulsory as a priority if you have free space and then as many Threatening Roars or Wabokus as you can. I prefer TRoar in the case of that one stray Glad Beast player PHope I helped and sorry again for the long ramble.

774774,0,t3_230zlr,The state of harpies right now is not terrible. We can pump out amazing rank s like chidori and zerofyne as well as rank s like draco and big eye. There have been a few comments here saying theyre inconsistent. Theyre not awful with consistency you run  of each harpie  party  sign  hunting ground and some techs with a bunch of traps. Ive tried a lot of different draw power in here whether it be Cardcar reckless duality or upstarts and I can say I havent liked them in it. Reckless hurts by stopping top decks for  turns upstarts are okay but not awesome cardcar can be amazing opening or late game but if youve negged yourself enough and youre topdecking its awful. Duality stops special summoning and lets people know what you get when you run so many traps and you pretty much want to be XYZing each turn. The only thing that has me worried is artifacts. One of our win conditions is back row popping and then controlling with rank s. When artifacts come out were kind of screwed with backrow popping. Pop one of them and they either special summon something or destroy something. We become a rank  engine which might not be enough to keep us on the cusp of tier  again.

The paper mats in the starterstructure decks might have to change but the full size mats are just going to have a layout change not a size change. Producing new mats means theyd have to pay for them rather than just paying to print them on existing mats and current mat tubes would not be long enough to accommodate them.

922209,0,t1_ch93i4v,Hm didnt think of reinforcements good idea. Hardened arm isnt so bad but it always feels oddly slow since i primarily use the level eaters for summoning.I actually get a LOT of mileage out of creature swap and scrubbed raid. Level eaters can buy me months of time until they draw that card by eating level eaters and creature swap often means that i can tribute their monster and attack into a level eater for mass damage and removing potentially problematic cards. Honestly i was more waffling about trying to run  and where the hell to put the cards for it.Cause thats the problem that i find I can protect those big monsters with march and other effects but i need to stall for time to summon them at least a turn or two most times and i couldnt think of another option.Vanitys Ruler makes BANK in this deck honestly. That with March of Monarchs basically means game over for most decks no recovering until they get rid of it. pretty much every deck spams SOME form of special summon and vanitys ruler does just such a good job of it. I agree that a second tragodia is in order its just such a damn good level eater target im thiiiinking light and darkness dragon to be honest.,yugioh,ch93zyz,1,t5_2rpe6

Attacks into Core.I drop Honest.The funny thing is that he actually claimed he had Honest in his hand as well but since mine was at Chain Link  him chaining it wouldnt have helped at all. What he couldve done was activate Honest prematurely in anticipation of mine but alas I dont think that was going through his brain when he declared an attack with a  ATK monster to my  ATK one.Since he went  to do that play I outresource him and counterpushed for game easily after that.,yugioh,chiegt3,2,t5_2rpe6

He was convinced they were rare because the guy told him so.

Its online only atm and I win a fairly good portion of matches with it. Its weak to boss monsters that have low attack less than  but at that point you have Beelze and Axon to fall back on for beatersimmune to destruction. If you cant make them the Contact with Gusto and Quill lets me recycle my monster loop to hopefully take them out in a second turn. Currently testing out the Scarecrows since sometimes I can be very vulnerable Abyss DwellerVanitys Emptiness. I took out my PoDs for them since the only time I want to use them is in my first turn when I am not special summoning. Other times they are dead in hand mostly. Constantly SSing puts a lot of pressure on the opponent and being able to recycle cards lets you get rid of their annoying traps solemntorrentialmirroretc while still being able to push for game when you need to.

1202378,0,t1_ci4mfnc,Thanks for the feedback man! I actually believe my build is extremely consistent at least in this format! as Ive been testing it out quite a bit on devpro and my winloss ratio isnt half bad. However it could just be random luck! Ill test out the Floatress combo It looks pretty awesome!!! but I still will probably personally prefer the Scrap Dragon gt Scrap Golem gt Scrap Dragon again. I also have tested out shadow impulse. Its a great card! But as you said its a dead draw as is Orthos. Orthos however is a card that I would definetly run at two. The chances that you get two in a hand is  and the deck has enough consistency that you will always have A a scrap  B a mill card. Meklord Emperor Granel also has the probability of . I can understand why you would want to put him down to two as he isnt too much help late game unless youre playing against a synchro deck. Also I would like to know what makes my deck slow in your opinion so I can tweak it. Thanks your feedback means a lot!

I see only three reasonable hits geargiagear to  geargiarmor to  geargiaccelerator to .Geargiagear is a special little bastard that allows my opponent a free Xyz material by using material he will later recycle. Take this away to absolutely ruin their consistency since the game seems to be about getting this off soon than using Gear Giant X for more searching and deck thinning.Geargiarmor too high a defense to have a pair of effects this absurdly abusable. Not to mention they can summon it from the deck search it and SS it from the graveyard. How stupidly absurd?Geargiaccelerator I honestly think cards that can be Special Summon just because you have another card on the field should not exist. Especially with XYZ monsters making it more powerful a play than it used to be.

People have been talking about Goyo Guardian Going to  for ages now bout time it happened card isnt really that OP.Mag of faith is cool at  but I dont really see a reason for it to be limited at all very few decks actually play it on account of it being so slow.Rota at  is nice but it happened so they could push Tellarknights so the deck would be really expensive and they could make money.Formula at  is ice but its not necessary the deck only needs  they should bring back glow up bulb if they want the deck to be stellar again.D prison and mirror Force at  is actually really cool.

Geargia takes out the extra geargiano and runs the  gear with the extra d prison.

Also on a seperate note constellar artifacts is a really strong deck you should try it out on devpro. Firstly dont ever drop sheratan. Sheratan searches out any constellar monster which you need to get Sombre late game. Also Why would he run wolfbark with only  bear?You should addGorilla x. You should really have  targets for tenki because you do search a lot and bear is not ad useful right now. Gorilla can pop spellstraps and still searches for tenki. soul charge. Not really needed in constellars because you already have good recursion with sombre. duality. This clutch to get an extra search late game or if you open with sheratan. You only need . vulcasaurus. Pops a monster and inflicts damage equal to its attack. Makes easy k damage with Gaia dragon.Otherwise this looks good.

It was also the first boss monster for my first truly competitive yugioh deck. Another one would be Serpent Night Dragon. I remember watching it in the anime against Joey and thought it was badass. At this point I only had the starter deck with nothing else because my mom and dad didnt understand that the packs were random. I convinced my grandma to get me a pack of MRL at Walmart one afternoon and I got the dragon. It was my first secret rare from my first real pack ever and i still keep it in my binder for good luck.But my favorite card is probably Dark Magician of Chaos.

1611930,0,t3_2crojn,I would say that there are a couple issues and a few insights that might turn around his outlook.    . He is losing because of his own mistakes. He needs to realize that there are people who can consistently make top  of major tournaments. They are doing this because they are very good. There is luck involved but you can say that for even poker. He can achieve this if he puts in the effort.  . His deck can be just as overpowered as his opponents. He chooses his deck and not every deck is balanced. This format is actually pretty good because there are a variety of good decks that can win within reason. I would say there are  decks that can beat any given top  deck right now with the right pilot.    . He can play the player as well as the deck. During game  you can usually pick up on your opponents tendencies. Its super subtle but if he can make the opponent think what he wants then he is in control. In yugioh its very hard to do due to the limit outcomes of your plays but it can be done.    . Each deck takes practice. Not only do you need to know all of your decks playscombos. You need to know every other possible opponents decks playscombos. Despite what many people say it isnt that easy memorizing every card effect and predicting the next play.    . You can just flat out lose. You can lose in a single turn even if you made the best possible play. Your opponent could have just had the perfect cards for the situation. It happens and the only thing you can do is take the loss understand the loss and move on. This is the luck factor I am talking about. This seems counteractive to point  but it is always a possibility and is best taken without anger or complaining. Even the best players lose every now and then.      Yugioh can be frustrating at times but its main purpose is to be a fun hobby. Patience and lightheartedness comes a long way. I wish him the best of luck!,yugioh,cjicmxv,1,t5_2rpe6

1777374,0,t3_2ev186,Crystal Beast SpellsCrystal AbundanceNormal SpellgtSend  Crystal Beast cards from your Spell amp Trap Card Zone to the Graveyard send all cards on the field to the Graveyard then Special Summon as many Crystal Beast monsters as possible from your Graveyard up to the number of cards your opponent controlled that were sent to the Graveyard by this cards effect.My thoughts Holy Pegasus is this card awesome! It is one of the most explosive OTK cards that Ive come across. Sending the four crystals to the graveyard is a cost so it can be a risky card to pull off but when you do it oh boy! Also notice that it says  SEND all cards on the field to the graveyard. Not destroy but send. This neat little wording lets us get over those annoying cards that negate destruction like Stardust Dragon for example much to my friends annoyance. One of the best spells in the deck easily.If youre playing a more control based build you wont need Abundance as much so run . If youre playing more aggressively youll want to be using Abundance every other turn so run .Crystal BeaconNormal SpellgtSpecial Summon  Crystal Beast monster from your Deck. You must have  or more Crystal Beast cards in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone to activate and to resolve this effect.My thoughts Crystal Beacon is fantastic! Getting two crystals in your backrow shouldnt be too hard so it shouldnt be a dead card very often. Obviously you should save this for either Sapphire or Ruby since they either help you set up or swarm the field respectively.Run . Some think it can be a little dead at  but I usually dont have that issue.Crystal PromiseNormal Spellgt Target  Crystal Beast card in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone Special Summon that target. My thoughts Once again this should be a card saved for Ruby or Sapphire but worst case scenario you can use it on someone else if you need extra defense or just need another monster to overlay with.Run . I think its really personal preference here.Crystal BlessingNormal SpellgtTarget up to  Crystal Beast monsters in your Graveyard place those targets faceup in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone as Continuous Spell Cards. My thoughts A good card but it isnt really as necessary as you may think. Dragons of Legend gave us access to two very useful cards Ayers Rock Sunrise and Soul Charge. Both of these are more useful than Blessing.Run  if you really think its necessary but the two cards I mentioned are more useful I think.Rare ValueNormal SpellgtIf there are  or more faceup Crystal Beast cards in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone Your opponent chooses  Crystal Beast card in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone and sends it to the Graveyard then you draw  cards.My thoughts Where Ayers Rock and Soul Charge made Blessing less useful they definitely helped Rare Value. Being able to retrieve Crystal Beasts from the Graveyard more often means that you can afford to be a bit more careless with Rare Value.Run . Some people insist on running . Personally I think  is fine but again this is more of a personal choice. Crystal ReleaseEquip SpellgtEquip only to a Crystal Beast monster. It gains  ATK. When this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard You can place  Crystal Beast monster from your Deck faceup in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone as a Continuous Spell Card.My thoughts Release has two things going for it.  It gives your monsters a boost making them great fighters a  ATK Tiger is pretty scary and  It replaces itself when it goes to the Graveyard. Plenty of possibilities here. Already have a monster on the field? Equip it with Release. Have Release in hand but no monsters? Set Release as a bluff. Equip Release to a monster then use Eagle to pop that monster off the field and Release will get its effect.Run . Personally I find  to be a good number but thats just me.Crystal TreeContinuous SpellgtEach time a Crystal Beast monsters is placed in either players Spell amp Trap Card Zone Place  Crystal Counter on this card. You can send this card to the Graveyard take a number of Crystal Beast monsters from your Deck equal to the number of Crystal Counters that were on this card then place those monsters faceup in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone as Continuous Spell Cards.My thoughts I didnt realize just how good Tree was until recently but wow its amazing! Opening the game with both a Tree and a Pegasus in hand is a great start. Keep in mind that you have to have as many free SpellTrap Zones as Tree has tokens to use Trees effect. If you have  counters on Tree and only  free spaces Tree is stuck there and you cant do anything about it. Only use Tree for  counters at a time just to be safe.Run . I highly recommend  since opening with it is a great start.Ancient City  Rainbow RuinsField SpellgtYou must have this many Crystal Beast cards in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone to activate and resolve these effects.   This card cannot be destroyed by card effects.   Once per turn including the opponents you can halve the Battle Damage you take.   During either players turn when a SpellTrap Card is activated You can send  Crystal Beast monster you control to the Graveyard negate the activation and if you do destroy it.   Once per turn during your Main Phase You can draw  card.   Once per turn during your Main Phase You can target  Crystal Beast card in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone Special Summon that target.My thoughts Maybe Im biased but I consider Rainbow Ruins to be THE BEST Field spell in the game. It protects itself halves damage negates spells and traps lets you draw and lets you flood the field with monsters. Definitely a contender for the best Field spell in my book.Run . More control based builds need the field more than aggressive builds so keep that in mind.Advanced DarkField SpellgtAll Crystal Beast monsters on the field and in the Graveyard become DARK. If Rainbow Dragon or Rainbow Dark Dragon attacks negate the effects of the attack target during that Battle Phase. During damage calculation if a Crystal Beast monster you control battles and you would take Battle Damage You can send  Crystal Beast monster from your Deck to the Graveyard you take no Battle Damage from that battle.My thoughts Honestly I really dont have much to say about this card since Ive never tried to build a dark Crystal Beast variant. I guess it would give you access to some of the awesome dark support but honestly the normal deck is already running tight on free space so I have no idea how you would make room for the dark support.Use  if youre going for a dark Crystal Beast deck but otherwise keep it at . Rainbow Ruins is clearly the better Field spell.Crystal Beast TrapsI want to preface this by saying that none of the Crystal Beast traps are very good. In most cases there is another card that works as a much better substitute. The only good Crystal Beast trap is Rainbow Gravity and its a Rainbow Dragon support card so.....Run  of all of these unless youre using Rainbow Dragon in which case I say use the Rainbow Dragon traps. Ill still list them here anyway.Crystal PairNormal TrapgtWhen a Crystal Beast monster you control is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard Place  Crystal Beast monster from your Deck faceup in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone as a Continuous Spell Card then you take no Battle Damage for the rest of this turn.My thoughts You have to let a monster go to the Grave which is never good. You also lose a Beacon target making Beacon more likely to be dead.Crystal RaigekiNormal TrapgtSend  Crystal Beast card from your Spell amp Trap Card Zone to the Graveyard to target  card your opponent controls destroy that target.My thoughts Again you have to send a crystal to the Graveyard. The threat removal is nice but Rainbow Ruins and Abundance should already be in your deck so Raigeki isnt needed.Crystal CounterNormal TrapgtSend all cards in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone to the Graveyard. Place as many Crystal Beast monsters as possible from your Graveyard in your Spell amp Trap Card Zone faceup as Continuous Spell Cards. During the End Phase destroy all faceup Crystal Beast cards you control.My thoughts It can be pretty good for an endgame push but Abundance is better at that I think.Last ResortNormal TrapgtActivate only when your opponents monster declares an attack. You can select  Ancient City  Rainbow Ruins from your Deck and activate it. If your opponent had an active Field Spell Card when this card was activated they can draw  card.My thoughts Terraforming is better. Terraforming doesnt let your opponent draw you dont have to wait on your opponent to attack to activate it and if you need to you can use it on Summoner Monk.Rainbow PathNormal TrapgtWhen an opponents monster declares an attack Send  Crystal Beast card from your Spell amp Trap Card Zone to the Graveyard to target the attacking monster negate the attack then you can add  Rainbow Dragon or Rainbow Dark Dragon from your Deck to your hand.My thoughts Situational and you lose a crystal. For Rainbow Dragon builds the next card is better. Rainbow GravityNormal TrapgtIf you have  Crystal Beast cards with different names on the field or in your Graveyard Special Summon  Rainbow Dragon or Rainbow Dark Dragon from your Deck or Graveyard ignoring the Summoning conditions.Easy way of summoning Rainbow Dragon if you use him. Or even better Rainbow Dark Dragon since you dont have to banish any monsters to summon him this way.,yugioh,ck36y7h,10,t5_2rpe6

1917335,0,t1_ckk50vq,Nephilim is definitely not better than Midrash. Midrash is far harder to deal with due to its antidestruction effect and its antispecial summoning effect. Nephilim only comes out when all the other defenses fail  if my opponent has successfully special summoned something too big for Egrystal or Shekhinaga to handle THAT is when Nephilim sees play. As for Facing the Shadows there is enough pitching power in the deck that it doesnt need to be run at . Ive got  Mathematicians a Foolish Burial  Lizards and  Facing the Shadows in my deck combined with  Shaddoll Fusions  ElShaddoll Fusions and  Hand Destructions if I need a specific card in the grave its not hard to get it there. For pitching Facing the Shadows is easily the weakest option in the deck contested only by Mathematician using up the normal summon. For flipping Hound is way more useful. Top decking a Facing the Shadows isnt going to help me at all if I need to set and flip a hedgehog this turn but Hound will get me there as well as being able to bring back ANY Shaddoll card from the grave monster or ST.

While most combos are inconsistent because they require you draw too many cards CatFuFu have the opposite problem they require that certain combo pieces stay in the deck and if you draw those combo pieces you lose on account of the decks not having a backup plan.Both of these cards are obscenely broken but their onecard FTKs are not in any way a problem.,yugioh,ckkkkpu,2,t5_2rpe6

1963722,0,t3_2h5rqe,Lightsworn Shaddoll or Hobandoll as you have called it is a combo Deck. It is much more aggressive and fast paced and can create very powerful boards off of Soul Charge. Its weakness is that in the amount of aggression and pressure it causes it does not have a lot of defense. Ideally you are going to make an unbreakable board off of Soul Charge but in the instance that said board gets broken through which isnt entirely out of the realm of possibility given the opponents likely use of Soul Charge and Black Luster Soldier if youre in the mirror as well as the presence of Breakthrough Skill you get put into a tough spot. It also drains LP fast which makes the lack of defense even tougher. Ideally you want to apply so much pressure that youre opponent doesnt have a chance to fight back but this isnt always the case.Artifact Shaddoll is not as aggressive. It is more passive and reactive but it also controls the game better and easily maintains momentum. It can punish players who go too hard on blind backrow destruction and Moralltach isnt as as bad in the mirror as people make it sound as its still an out to Construct that doesnt require the Extra Deck which is great given the fact that we only have one Compulse. The extra backrow means you can intercept opposing plays a lot easier and regain control of the game easier.Its preference as to what you prefer though the Lightsworn build seems to be doing better. I personally am partial towards the Artifact build but also keep in mind that the banlist could change everything.,yugioh,ckptwi1,3,t5_2rpe6

There isnt any strategy to the deck its just a bunch of water cards dumped together. Theres better win conditions than trying to stall to win with Final Countdown. If you like water decks make a mermail or penguin deck. I used to play a ALO deck way back but its kind of awkard to use your extra deck because ALOs   level screws up synchro and xyz plays.

2109310,0,t3_2j2wdu,in order of favoritismKarakuri my most competitive deck irl and always my favorite. The only deck i have that hasnt been even remotely net decked in some way. Everything I know about the deck comes from my own experiences with it including techs and combos. Plus Im always experimenting with the different variants so its hard to get tired of the deck.Gravekeepers and Gladiator Beasts These were my first real decks throughout the game. Controlstun has had its ups and downs throughout my career but I always come back to these two when i just want to have some fun. Junk Doppel Plant and WindUps  of the more recent additions to my collection. I like them because i just love highly combo oriented decks. Plus i think JDP and a few other plant variant decks are some of the more skillful decks to play no where near the most skillful but definitely up there just due to all of the possible plays with what to search what to dump when to dump it what synchro to go in to. And again im at the point where ive stopped looking up certain decks just knowing some of the card choices and going from there to see what i build myself and how much ive matured from when i started this game and that fact makes me fall in love with my decks.Honorable mentions go to crystal beasts for possibly being the most fun deck ive ever piloted Vennominaga turbo for my gimmick deck and infernity may you rest in peace for the next couple formats.,yugioh,cl7xsxp,8,t5_2rpe6

2124675,0,t3_2j9t9q,For those who cant read it on the site for whatever reasonHey everybody! Im back this week after an exciting weekend in Columbus Ohio for the ARG Circuit Series. The Circuits next stop is this weekend in Des Moines. Ill be there to compete with some amazing players for some terrific prizes. I hope to see you all this weekend in Iowa! To help you all prepare for this weekends tournament and any future tournaments you may attend Im going to bring you a list of biases that people tend to have when they think about YuGiOh. Becoming aware of these biases will allow you to remove them from your playtesting and to remain objective in your findings. Switching from subjective to objective is one of the quickest ways to improve your results and grow as a player. Lets jump right in!Ambiguity EffectThe ambiguity effect is where people tend to avoid options for things that are missing some information. This makes the probability seem unknown. Lets say for example youve got  Graff and  Scarm left in deck and  Cir left in deck. The other  Graff  and  Scarm are in your grave and there is no Dante in grave yet. Do you pull the last Graff from deck with Tour Guide or do you pull a Cir instead? On one hand Cir is almost strictly better than Graff at this point in the game so you might think itd be better to leave Cir in deck so you have access to all of them. On the other hand if you pull out Graff youve only got Cirs left in your deck so when you search for Scarm in the end phase youre searching Cir for sure. Then if you draw into Cir you have double Cir in hand which doesnt give you a rank  with Cirs effect that turn but if you drew the Graff instead you could special Graff and summon Cir for a solid rank  play and still have Cirs effect. Which of those is right? Dont know tribute for Raiza!And thats the ambiguity effect.AnchoringThe anchoring effect is when people form their opinion based on some sort of an event such that if they were put in a similar situation in the future theyd likely refer to their original experience in order to pass judgment. A real world example of this would be what happened to Michael Brown would likely shape the way many of us think about race relations in America. An example within the game would be Billy winning Dallas with  cards which might cause you to think that the number of cards in your deck really isnt all that important.Availability CascadeAn availability cascade is when you repeat something long enough you think it becomes true. For example you might always side deck ShadowImprisoning Mirror against all versions of Shaddolls but in the Artifact build it gets popped by Moralltach and in the Lightsworn build it gets popped by Lyla. In actuality it might not be that great but it becomes so second nature to put it in against them that you believe its correct.Bandwagon EffectIm sure most of you are familiar with this one but its when people do or believe something because so many other people did or believed it. For example Geargia was widely thought to be the best deck during Nationals format which caused tons of people to play it even though Id say there is a strong case for multiple other decks being better than Geargia during that format.Confirmation BiasThis is one of the most dangerous biases to your performance on this list. Its when people decide on a conclusion and then seek facts to fill in what they have already decided to be true. Everybody loves being right but youll be more successful in all of your endeavors if you argue to find the right answer instead of arguing to be right.Endowment EffectThe endowment effect is the idea that people value their stuff more and want more for it simply because they have it but are not willing to give up that amount to acquire it originally. They dont even have to like whatever it is they have they just simply have to have it. For example if I ask you to buy a coffee mug for  you might pass. But if I give you a similar coffee mug for free and then someone asks to buy it from you for  you might say ? Sorry I couldnt possibly do less than . Im sure you see this all the time with trading in the game.Framing EffectThis is where people draw different conclusions from the same info based on how or by whom it was presented. Do you want  donuts or half a dozen?Joe Blow  I think Caius is better than Raiza.People  Get outta here man Raiza is way better.Joe Giorlando  I think Caius is better than Raiza.People  Yeah dude that totally makes sense!Cont...,yugioh,cl9w5fk,8,t5_2rpe6

2135504,0,t3_2je9gl,I was playing on Devpro when Shaddolls were first announced and people were playing them on there and they were unstoppable. No one knew what the hell to do to get rid of them at the time. I was playing Cyber Dragons doing really shitty but decided to stay in the duel to see if I could still win. He had about  hp and I only had  by the end of the duel which turned in favor for me. The final few turns of the duel were me special summoning my second Cyber Dragon cause he had a MidrashWinda out. I played a LOT of draw power in that deck just to get what I needed to get out really quickly. So I special summoned my Cyber set two jar of greed and end my turn. I was on the complete defensive. His turn comes draws M MSTs one of my jars and i chain my other so I can get my draw off. Aww. Yiss. Honest. It does seem like a lot of the responses in this thread are about honest drops but even then its so satisfactory to turn the tide of the duel with a single card.Battle Phase he attacks his WindaMidrash into Cyber Dragon and I drop honest. No counters he takes  and I won the duel. It was extremely satisfying beating Shaddolls when they had first come out because they were so powerful.

The combo can be disrupted too so even if the consistency were there Im not sure it would be a great deck. Something like this though. Most of the builds pretty obvious but Ill talk a little about a few odder choices. Into the Void Chain Material lets you use stuff from grave so the significant downside to Into the Void doesnt really come into play here. Worstcase scenario is you end up discarding some Kuribandits. Kuribandit Chain Material isnt searchable but this is the closest thing you have to it Jar of GreedLegacy of Yata These are mostly filler cards but they do serve some purpose your opponent will know if you add Chain Material to your hand via Kuribandit these cards function as decoys to offer some protection from MST as well as drawing cards.,yugioh,clbm9ju,1,t5_2rpe6

The thing I love about them is the fact that most Rank  decks can summon multiple Xyz monsters in a turn and the Djinns reward you when you pair them up. Id actually been considering making room for Melomellody because double attacking is really nice and she has great combos with Muzurhythm and Humhumming. Tempo especially gives you great reward if you have additional Djinns out and back when every deck was an Xyz spam deck he was almost always live.Ill try siding out Tempo in favour of a second Fortune Tune. Fact is it may just be time to retire him. Ill do some testing with XG and a second Fortune Tune however I do think that Chrononaught is farther gone than Temtempo and get back to you.,yugioh,clcsjdm,2,t5_2rpe6

2154180,0,t1_cldmlvd,Because unlike vanitys you have to summon fossil dyna. So you cant go off on your turn and have an established board. Instead you need to burn your normal summon just to put a low attack easy to kill monster on board. Where as you can just set vanitys after going off and call it a day. Plus vanitys can disrupt plays such as tour guide or other cards that special summon. Where dyna is either already face up so your opponent knows they have to get over it or is set and in the case of the top decks of this format they will usually plus on you destroying their specials monsters or they already have effects where they cant be destroyed anyway.,yugioh,cldn866,6,t5_2rpe6

Since the text references a target at resolution all properties that the target was required to have at activation must be maintained from activation until resolution. Alucards target is  set SpellTrap Card your opponent controls. If your opponent chains the target it is no longer  set SpellTrap Card your opponent controls and thus is not destroyed.

Automod does a decent job of at least tagging posts but theres really no way for it to judge if a post should stay or be deleted. I understand  that the mods have lifes too and dont dedicate  of their time here and I also understand that theres probably a LOT going on behind the scenes that we dont know about.  Let me be clear Im not trying to call anyone lazy what so ever.  I would just like to point out that theres been a fair bit of stuff leaking through especially most rf threads and troll posts  and the mods seem a little overwhelmed trying to enforce the rules of the sub.  I know most of those posts get deleted after awhile but like I said some still slip through.   It might be helpful to add another mod or two just to help with site clean up.

2330526,0,t3_2m05i5,I believe Shaddolls are only vaguely reminiscent of Mermails in the sense that you have some toolbox options with what to send in the case of Mathematician  Undine abusing chain links etc. But Shaddolls also have great disruptionstun whereas Mermail try to push for really big boards every turn. Shaddolls can do a lot on the opponents turn Sinister ElShaddoll Sanctum Super Poly disrupt plays a lot more than what Mermails can. I liken it to HAT almost.I dont find anything in your Ruler analogy. Every deck wants to commit to the board enough to beat their opponent and nothing more in fear of overextension. This is not only limited to Shaddolls.Evilswarm analogy is qutie superficial in the sense that Ophion  Winda and both are the easiest to summonhave the most value Extra Deck monster in either deck both with protection effects. Whereas Evilswarms can go into a variety of Rank s for other situations Shaddolls are only limited to the Fusion whose attribute matches up with the monsters in their handfield or if the opponent Special Summoned from the Extra or you have Core but these situations do not happen often than one may think.Shaddolls really brought to the table a completely new mechanic a very metarelevant punishing summoning from the Extra Deck. I do not believe I have ever seen anything like it before in YGO and that Shaddolls are really unique in that sense and not solely a combination of previous archetypes.Everything else is spoton.

If there was a better volcanic to pitch Id play that instead. but Im definitely not fixed on keeping it at . Im testing a Counter vs Upstart. I have arguments for both cases.gt I like the idea of using ChameleonVulcan gives you some good removal and Goyo gives you that  beater that this deck kinda lacks.  would have been perfect but I cant really complain that Goyo doesnt have enough attack. Dont dismiss Armades though. He gives Shaddolls and Ba a lot of trouble.gt Im a little skeptical of running Blaze Accelerator without Monk thoughI like  BA. This decks biggest beater is Rocket pretty much. Sometimes you just werent going to be able to attack anyway and BA gives you that removal. The real reason I like it though is because Heartlanddraco is a beast. Im serious. This deck already has the tendency to just gain huge advantage while chipping at the opponent. A lot of decks cant immediately deal with something that can attack directly and cant be attacked back.gt Doomfire too seems a bit of a waste since you have to sacrifice a MagazineI run Doomfire at one for exactly that reason. With the draw this deck has youll without a doubt get  Magazine at some point. Sending one to the grave than wont be a big deal. You also wont always have Volcanics to ditch and a Magazine in grave is that nice super raigeki when you need it. Its options. The reason I run Doomfire over Wild Fire is simply because Volcanic Blaster searches it. Its options nothing more. I cant remember the last time I saw or needed Doomfire. I might take him out.gt And the pseudosearcher seems pretty weak compared to straight draw powerdeck thinningIt is. Its wholly subpar. But its an extra Rocket.,yugioh,cma0t2d,1,t5_2rpe6

Top decking salvage can help grabbing a Linde and Gunde could bring you back more especially if you have no discard if you drew Turge. Both can be dead early on so either way youre looking at the utility of that midlate game. Pwwb also takes some deaddraw fear away. As for some of the extra Ive been testing triedge and it comes in handy sometimes against BA. But like you said its not scary unless under Abyss Dweller but by then you have dwellers eff to deal with BA and the  beater. They wont be able to use that monster later granted but Ive found that Blade Master is far superior in the BA matchup. Another one to consider is the Yang Zing monster Yazi.

Obviously you cannot target a Spell Card with Phoenix Wing Wind Blast after the spell card has been activated. But you can target a Spell Card with MST and it will be destroyed by MST. Logically Heavy would destroy itself but I guess its just something I have to accept.Another question. When continuous cards are destroyed when do they stop applying their effects? I am wondering because say I Black Rose a field which has Field Barrier and an active Field Spell. The field Spell card is not destroyed because of Field Barrier.However say I have a field with Macro Cosmos and I Black Rose it.

2776364,0,t3_2rvh9t,The effect of a UA monster to special summon from the hand by returning another UA monster on the field to the hand is a summoning condition not an effect activating. Lets compare two cards Black Luster Soldier  Envoy of the Beginning and Blaster Dragon Ruler of Infernos. Both of these cards are able to be special summoned by banishing certain cards from your graveyard in Blasters case from your hand too but that is irrelevant when discussing this topic. The card text of BLS reads Must first be Special Summoned from your hand by banishing  LIGHT and  DARK monster from your Graveyard. Blasters card  text reads If this card is in your hand or Graveyard You can banish a total of  FIRE andor DragonType monsters from your hand andor Graveyard except this card Special Summon this card. Notice how in BLSs card text the summoning effect is just one plain sentence with no other punctuation other than a period at the end. Blaster however has a clause that ends in a colon and another clause that ends in a semi colon. Thats because BLSs effect to summon is not an effect activating but merely a condition that must be fulfilled to summon the card. This is an INHERENT summon. When summoning BLS you are not required to reveal the card or state that you are activating an effect because youre not activating anything you only need to banish a LIGHT and DARK from grave and put it on the field. The UA monsters also summon themselves in this manner. Blaster on the other hand is not an inherent summon. This is shown by the colon and semi colon in his card text. Blasters summon is an effect of a monster activating in hand or graveyard depends on where he is because he can summon himself from both locations. The part after the colon is the cost to activate the effect. So you would banish the two monsters and then reveal blaster to your opponent and state you are activating the effect to summon. They have chance to respond but if they do not then the part after the semi colon takes place in this case Blaster summoning to the field. So lets say there is a Majestys Fiend on the field. Majestys Fiend states Monster effects cannot be activated. This monster stops monster effects anywhere graveyard deck hand extra deck banished etc. However if I have a BLS in hand and a LIGHT and DARK in grave to banish I can summon BLS. However if I had a Blaster in hand or in grave I would not be able to even activate the effect.,yugioh,cnjnvd9,3,t5_2rpe6

I might do Lightsworns later since theyve grown on me.Gimmick Puppet Gear Changer     A small Machine that wanders about tuning its knobs frequency to previously undiscovered channels.GP Egg Head    This dolls origins are unknown but its unsettling stare is known to cause paranoia. GP Humpty Dumpty    Once a childs toy this doll has long since been abandoned. One can sense a weak dark aura possessing it.GP Scissor Arms    This doll wanders about cutting anything that gets close. By the way it walks it appears to be in pain.GP Des Troy    Inexplicably found in a pile of defective dolls this creature imitates a horse. When it falls apart the     dolls act independently to reform it.GP Shadow Feeler    The two figures that make up this fiendish Machine are said to once have been people whose     obsessions with creating living machines led them to experiment on each other.GP Nightmare    This horrific doll holds unspeakable power but it is checked by the smaller dolls restraining it. According    to rumors the smaller dolls were its victims.GP Magnet Doll    This puppets body segments are made of a weak alloy but the powerful magnets in its joints hold    everything together rendering it unbreakable unless they are all removed.GP Twilight Joker    At night this jester Machine dances around swinging its scythe wildly. If it notices anyone watching     it hunts them down until sunrise.GP Dreary Doll    Though many stories are told about this terrifying doll the only known fact is that any living thing    that is sealed inside its coffin will vanish permanently leaving only a bloodstain.GP Giant Grinder    Created as an experiment to dispose of trash it was eventually used for darker purposes which    corrupted it. Its platform also serves as a restraint.GP Giant Hunter    No longer restrained this unstoppable menace rampages mindlessly. Its only purpose is to destroy    and it will stop at nothing to ruin all it sees.GP of Strings    This powerful puppet hides an array of string launchers. Once its foes are properly restrained it    slaughters each one in turn slowly.GP of Dark Strings    Fiendishly wielding its strings this puppet has gained the ability to control other creatures as a    puppeteer. It is even capable of manipulating their thoughts.GP of Leo    It is thought that this intelligent king of puppets knows a prophecy of the end of the world but     it has never been observed to speak. Instead it bides its time and stores energy for its own    purposes.GP Disaster Leo    The oncemajestic puppet kings former persona has been lost. Now its only purpose is to invite    destruction via the large sphere it guards. If it does so all of reality will perish.,yugioh,cnp6sbu,10,t5_2rpe6

2932258,0,t3_2tqgkt,After the geargiagear hit Ive actually been steering away from the anos since they tend to be dead without each other. For instance you would never want to draw into geargiano mk unless you have another geargiano to summon to make a rank . Even then I feel like rank  is much more powerful this meta and instead of running the anos Ive been running either the traptrix engine until denko sekka became popular and backrow is less powerful hand engine less preferred since they stop plussing once you start xyzing with them and theyre another normal summon segoc tin goldfish can get you a gigant really easily and is another large defensive body also sets up an inferno reckless summon if needed but vulnerable to breakthrough or just stick with the main  and add consistency and antimeta shenanigans. If any anos Id run  ano  mk and  mk with geargiagear. Mk  is most useful in hand with the build although you never want to draw any of them. Anos tribute to special is decent off of gigant but I personally feel mk does the job better.Also no attacker. Can be dead and is another normal summon.

There are a lot of things that can be changed in this deck unfortunately for you the Magicina of Black Chaos is too inconsistent to bring out since you cant search him nor the ritual card. Id cut Crusader Magicians Valkyria Alchemist of Black Spells and Magical Marionetteunless you want to play Transmodify. Try adding more generic spell cards to generate spell counters like  Upstart Goblin Pot of Duality and Spell Power Grasp. You also need ways to bring out your Citadel remove the Secret Village of Spellcasters and add more  Citadels. Spell Absorption is useless here same with scapegoat hammer shot smashing ground and Magicians Unite.Id recommend playing  Apprentice Magician   targets for himeither  Magician of Faith and  Old Vindictive Magician or  Old Vindictive Magician.

3011003,0,t3_2unwz6,Ok just going to point this out you CANNOT run  cards with the same name in a deck and since harpie lady  and cyber harpie ladys names are both ALWAYS treated as harpie lady no matter were in the game they are located you cannot run more than any combination of  cards that have the name harpie lady have the text this card is always treated as harpie lady... Ok onwards to the deck advise!!! You should have  harpie channeler in this deck no matter what. Shes what makes te deck run and when you can convert this deck into a rank  spam with a few rank s when u actually get a harpies pet. I would cut the tribute engine altogether no treeborn or raiza they dont really add much to the deck... A fun combo to pull off is to run magical hats its not ALWAYS the most successful combo but it grabs you a plus and protects you you throw hysteric sign into the magical hats combo and hysteric sign gains its effect Also in general theres a few other cards that are sub optimal that you should probably cut but your first goal should be to get hysteric sign harpies channeler etc etc looks pretty good so far from what you have,yugioh,coa379t,2,t5_2rpe6

If you play D Fissure you give your opponent the rest of your own turn to get rid of it and the beginning of their turnI say beginning because if they lose any monsters they lose advantage.

3069629,0,t1_co2hqv6,No Darklaw is the problem. Darklaw gives way to much board control by just existing. He not only hinders the current status of the board but potential plays by being able to banish cards from the hand when your opp searches. This ability to control not only existing boards but outs that the opposing player may have makes him destructive card to the format. I am okay with the card if it were to be limited giving heros the out they require against decks like all the current meta decks. That being said anymore then the existence of one Darklaw makes him to splashable completely forcing the current and existing decks out. He not only negates the grave but the hand which I have always found to be a dangerous power creep. The hand should be manipulated but the way in which DarkLaw does this directly effects the ability of the opposing player to respond to its board existence. ,yugioh,cog5wgk,1,t5_2rpe6

When this card is summoned send one card your opponent controls to the graveyard. You can only use this effect of Masked HERO Burning Man once per turn.This gives HEROes a way to deal with antidestruction or antitargeting effects.Masked HERO LightBringerlevel  LIGHTMust be summoned by Mask Change and cannot be summoned by other ways. If this card is summoned during your Main Phase  You can target up to  of your banished HERO monsters return those targets to the graveyard and if you do draw  card for each.

Players that climb to a certain place in the ladder at the end of testing can vote whether or not a Pokemon is banned.You see? Random people arent getting triple JD banned.

3244426,0,t1_coy75bd,Its just an infamous joke because unicore is said to be speed spell  and it really is because he can negate counter traps but counter traps cant negate it theres nothing that can even negate or even respond to it successfully whilst hands match of course.But seriously if you summon him in raccoons and you match hands on your turn which actually isnt even all that difficult its absolutely insane.

3251546,0,t3_2vk57a,Alright so I dont really browse this subreddit much anymore mainly because I stopped playing the tcg. I love yugioh and according to the sidebar gtThe subreddit for players of the YuGiOh! card game video games or fans of the YuGiOh! anime series or manga. Discuss tactics episodes decks or whatever youd like.Except it doesnt feel like that. Its very clearly the yugioh tcg subreddit maybe there will be some show stuff when a new one starts or ends but for the most part this may as well be ryugiohtcg. Others have stated it before and I definitely agree that the subreddit feels way to hostile. Its not really a friendly place and theres just way to many rules. Discussion is fine and fun but you gotta balance it out with some casual and easily accessible content. I like coming on reddit in the mornings and looking at some pictures and watching some videos. I dont always feel like getting into lengthy conversationsdiscussions or reading them. The last thing is that I really miss the weekly trade threads. Those were the biggest draw of the subreddit to me. I always liked to see peoples collections and maybe trade a few cards. However I still liked the other content of the sub and didnt want to have to go to another sub just to trade. Most of the time when I found myself checking the sub a year ago I would look at a few RFs maybe a pull post or two any other cool videos or pics linked on the front page and then one or two discussions about archetypes or the state of the game. Now the sub is all self posts it seems sure you can submit links but they are mostly removed or downvoted into oblivion and overall the subreddit just seems anti fun hostile and not representative of the yugioh community as a whole. ,yugioh,coz161r,1,t5_2rpe6

3262660,0,t3_2xhoa9,Hmm well I would suggest gearing the deck more towards beating the mirror as you cant main enough Qli hate to give you a decent game  match up and deal with the mirrorBAShaddoll. So I would find room for three maxx c in the main possibly by dropping the three mst as they are more often than not just dead cards in the mirror and its unrealistic that just  backrow destroyers is enough to deal with the  floodgates that Qli and other decks can play against N. I would also suggest just siding the  hidden armory. Snatch steal is no longer a djin out and while it is beneficial against Qli its very often dead in the mirror as you constantly trying to clear board and so there arent monsters for you to steal. In regards to djin outs I would suggest playing  and seeing that you have to play themit makes sense to play the best one which is book of eclipse as it cant be prevented and any half decent player is going to be able to protect their djin lock and so youre just falling either further behind if your out is wasted. Dance princess isnt really that brilliant either. If they have the vanitys theyll just flip it on the Princess summon and so you have  have a suboptimal battle phase that turn or are still left unable to special summon. In her place you could give Archmage a try as he has more utility in the mirror with it adding another layer to your combos in giving you an easy Valk or unicore search and access to Shrit. In regards to your extra deck I dont think you need the lv as it is incredibly rare for it come up as Unicore and Brio are used more for their searching abilities rather than their on field effects. The lv though however is useful as it does just allow you to summon a brio and push for the extra  damage or being able to spin extra deck monsters is always nice vs things such as BAShaddollTellars.For the side deck you might want to drop the hands as they can be played around with some ease. I would look to find room for a Kycoo and some Effect Veilers for when playing the mirror. Kycoo lets you pushed for go for game not get trished and prevent mirror searches. Veiler is great as it prevents the opponent clearing board or  sending the djin to grave.,yugioh,cp06psf,3,t5_2rpe6

Note the lack of spells and traps as most of the cards you want to mill are your monsters such as lightsworn names and eclipse wyvern.I do remember a couple of things about why I built it that way.I tried to keep the extra deck waterattribute free and nondragon free as they are not valid fodder for the dragon rulersno . I also think I ran Daigusto Emeral and Castel in the extra but theyre in other decks. The rulers I use are Redox Tempest and Blaster a reference to Earth Wind and Fire.

3311312,0,t1_cp5oea1,I agree that Alich is a great card at one but I find it dead a lot of the time due to Breakthrough and Divine Wrath putting a lot of work in. If I were to put it in Id probably take out Rubic and therefore Virgil but I think having the option to go into Virgil is necessary. If I had the space I would run Alich for sure as its a great card situationally. I believe  Mask Change is essential for BA in this format as it puts you at a great advantage against every deck in the meta and it never seems to clog for me.I have since upped my MST count to two as a result of not having access to any Raigeki Breaks may try to acquire them at the event and I agree its vital against every matchup except Nekroz. Fire Lake at two I found quite cloggy. Though its very good in a lot of matchups having  BAs onboard means the card isnt live at all times and I think thats quite important. I agree about Vanitys Fiend and Spell Canceller but unfortunately I dont have access to Spell Cancellers so Fiends just really in there as Emptiness  and . Definitely the weakest card in the sideboard and I will probably take it out before Saturday. Ive not played Raigeki or BLS for a while now. As theyre limited I find having one copy of a card means Im more likely to mill it or just never see it in a game and theyre both dead cards in the grave rather have something like Breakthrough Skill where even if I mill it its live. I feel like this deck doesnt really need any sack cards too as it dwindles the opponents resources allowing small pushes for damage over a relatively long amount of time. Adding aggressive cards wouldnt really assist my strategy.  Mirror Force is definitely something I want to try out in the side though as its great against all matchups.

3318418,0,t3_2y5cbb,I run a dragon ruler variant on devpro and dueling network and I can say that the deck is extremely strong. However as my friends have taught me its only good against decks outside of the tier  position your exodia deck is not going to win. When you put it against shaddolls or nekroz it will hold its own but it isnt going to be an easy game.Like most OTK decks it requires an all or nothing play style so any deck that can prevent a key special summon or delay attacks can really fuck with it. The thing that makes the Dark Matter OTK so strong is its consistency. From experience you can keep summoning a copy out until you banish all of your dragons. This usually happens at turn four. After that the deck stops being good. So any kind of deck that can just wait out the onslaught while removing the summoned galaxyeyes can easily outlast it for example lightsworn raccoons,yugioh,cp6j0ny,4,t5_2rpe6

I also run wing blast. Im not a fan of burst rebirth. Its not great tbh. I use pinpoint guard personal tech I know its not too great but it lets me recycle valeryfawn or kitten. I also use vanity emptiness in my line up and  majesty fiend. Majesty fiend and a well placed unicore is pretty gg at times unicore is continuous therfor doesnt activate and doesnt get hurt by majesty .

Plus I get that these are supposed to be informative articles but if you string togther  of them in a series and try to attribute it to some master strategy then youre a joke.Mental game? The only mental game you should be playing with your opponent is making them wonder what you have in your hand in your deck and facedown on the field. If you clearly say that youre going to side out a card you removed part of the mental game. Also the mental game applies for most of the duel not  you hack.Archetypes producing skillful formats? By your loose definition of skill yes. By an actual definition of skill no. Skill means you take a deckor build one learn the ins and outswhether its an archetype or not and then you use it. Like with any deck youll win some and youll lose some. Of course archetypes somewhat reduce the skill in the game because theres the stupidest combos that yield things close to an autowin. Weve got talentless hacks being backed by money to win tournaments by any means necessary. The author of this article is the perfect example.Archetypes destroy skillful formats.

3485213,0,t3_3017zw,I have been playing six sams exclusively since getting back to the game and I think gateway to one wouldnt be groundbreaking by any means necessary.  The power creep is ridiculous right now and decks like nekroz and burning abyss get ridiculous card advantage nowadays. Ive done everything I can to make the deck competitive and can happily say Ive topped locals a few times recently.  However I dont believe I would do as well in regionals or even ycs. Six sams are still a great deck and can be competitive  and have gotten better since the current format has made them sort of an anti meta deck so giving them gateway back would open up a lot of options and be more like a win more card rather than a card that breaks the meta and puts them in the same league as nekroz.

3607844,0,t3_31oiyj,It uses the April  banlist to start. Most people play it preCRV but posttins so Exarion Universe is legal but Cyber Dragon isnt. The rules are the same as modern yugioh except you draw a card turn  and ignition effects have priority  basically I get to use my spell speed  monster effects like Breaker the Magical Warrior and Exiled Force before you can respond with anything. Priority hasnt been around for years but that was a crucial ruling at the time. Look around the web for discussions of goat format to get an idea of how the format played what the decks did etc. it was a much slower time in the game Synchros werent out then so theres a lot of reliance on normal summons and controlling the pace of the game. Hand advantage was absolutely crucial during goats and it was much more back and forth  many games would go to time in  minute rounds. Its a lot of fun.

3706928,0,t1_cqespgp,Im pretty sure most meta decks push for game with multiple attacks instead of one big one. And Excalibur is one of the view options in which Magic Cylinder would be best since Excaliburs continued field presence is negligible. Dimensional prison gets rid of issues like  castel Dark Law Anki Koga etc. Leaving any of which on the field in favor of damage is a mistake. As they all have the ability to either limit your field presence remove monsters or grow in power. Thus becoming a greater issue. Another way to consider it since you play Heroes imagine youre facing Shaddoll. They open with construct. At the moment you have to play around Construct. Your  Priority is getting rid of Construct because itll fuck you up otherwise. You want to go for Dark Law summoning it would probably win you the game but Construct is just going to destroy it next turn anyway. If you have magic cylinder that might buy you a turn or so but the thing you summon next turn still has to deal with that Construct. If you have Mirror Force all of their shit is destroyed and banished. You can deal  to the face with Dark Law instead of  with Cylinder. And next turn you dont have to worry about anything. You only have to protect dark law and pump out even more damage. So the  ATK Castel you might have used to get rid of Construct just became a  ATK Excalibur that would have otherwise been destroyed by Construct. Establishing a board with more options is more important than immediate damage because it allows long term damage.EDIT As a heart in the cards near the end of the game topdeck Cylinder can be a godsend. Otherwise other options are better. ,yugioh,cqetcu1,1,t5_2rpe6

No. Dracosack is easily outable by targeting effects that dont destroy it. And targeting effects are more popular now because of that. Destruction ie mirror force unbanning of raigeki etc has only just started seeing play again because nekroz doesnt answer destruction as easily.  Before dracossack only a couple answers wing blast divine wrath honor ark if it was in atk but new cards were released and it got powercrept as sad as that sounds.A field like felgrandstardust spark which was meta back in PRIO format which was unbreakable then is just easily outed by TrishbriotowersVirgilwing blast etc. ,yugioh,cqfpctj,1,t5_2rpe6

I beat a well known BA player from my local  and a good Qli as well note to self find an out to towers thats how he got game one but other than that every game Ive won has come from an OTK so that aspect is quite consistent. Some tweaking does need to be done the real issue I have found is that the deck needs to be built a certain way to succeed so when it comes to siding that can affect consistency vs top tier decks.

Temple of the kings was an idea I got from him and Im just trying it out.

3896590,0,t3_35299f,I personally dont like Upstart Goblin because in most matches giving your opponents lifepoints isnt optimal. Volcanics are typically a very grindy burncontrol deck so taking  lifepoints is difficult assuming you use all .  I say between Veiler Fossil Dyna and TKing some has to go. They dont help advance your gamestate too much especially since TKing can shut down your Shell draw power. Personally I only run the  Fossil Dyna the lock it can provide with the protection Volcanics offers is real and if you need your extra deck just Chain the Dyna XYZ and use Planter on the now dead Chain. I used to run Monks and need to try them again now that I have more extra deck space.Temple of the Kings is cool but its almost worthless late and uses up an important ST slot. Were a backrow deck every space counts.  I ended up sideboarding my Mind Crushs as personal preference since I saw a lot more decks that dont add recently but I know its a great card this format.  Max out on Fiendish Chains. I also run  Volcanic Counter its won me games and its another Reload dump at least. I also would run  Raigeki or Wildfire for when you dont have a Scatter dump ready.  I techd in Doomsfire but its preference based.  Ring of Destruction is another tech that can win you games in a pinch.  Also Magic Cylinder. Its such a scrub card but its just so savage and catches many people off guard. Almost no one expects to see it now which is why it works.   Side deck wise make some room for NonFusion area vs Shaddolls it can help if you face a HERO deck that uses Elemental Fusion HEROs too. Mask Change and Ritual Beasts are NOT fusion summons though or so I was told so be wary of that.  This is my profile in case you were wondering.,yugioh,cr0g1nv,1,t5_2rpe6

3944605,0,t3_35m0zx,I think you should consider running less goalkeeper and more rebounder. Even if they do get destroyed you can bring it back with rebounder. Also draw power isnt what this deck needs. You just need to keep advantage by playing your UAs right. You have stadiumpenalty box thats the best draw power. So Maxx c isnt the strongest here.Tried turnover tactics? I like to let my opponent go for a big play and summon extra deck monsters  flip tactics and since their monsterss dont get sent back to the main deck they dont get to special summon. I love the oasis of dragon souls idea. Im totally gonna exchange call for it  and this deck has a problem not having midfielder st turn. And even with him at  rota at  and signing deal it sometimes doesnt happen lol. I main a few rank s warrior lady is great maybe monk? Also the heroics are pretty good.

3953921,0,t1_cr6vh6p,Kids edits were never an issue and K MediaKonami still have the rights to YuGiOh! GX season . If you are referring to the  lawsuit between Kids and ADKTV Tokyo that dispute was over a different matter entirely. From the Hollywood reporter Last March the Japanese studios behind YuGiOh! conducted an audit that turned up nearly  million in owed money for allegedly hidden revenue improper royalty deductions wrongful tax withholdings and more. TV Tokyo Corporation and Nihon Ad Systems canceled their licensing agreement and filed a lawsuit against Kids. The moves rattled the American childrens entertainment company which replaced its top staff and filed for bankruptcy.Now almost a year to the day after Kids was rocked by news that their Japanese partners were walking away the two sides have resolved the dispute. To close the case the plaintiffs ADKTV Tokyo are paying the defendant Kids  million. In addition the settlement agreement recognizes that Kids continues to hold rights to distribute YuGiOh! around the world outside of Asia.  After the lawsuit was resolved Saban attempted to purchase a number of Kids assets though Konami stepped in and picked up the YuGiOh! rights and production facility renaming it K Media. Saban walked away with the broadcast rights to several shows and the CW Saturday morning cartoon block which they called Vortexx. YuGiOh! appeared on the Vortexx block but had nothing to do with Saban. more info Below are links to the end credits of Power Rangers Samurai and Megaforce neither of which mention K Media.Power Rangers Samurai creditsPower Rangers Megaforce credits,yugioh,cr6zb6r,1,t5_2rpe6

4044221,0,t3_357ohc,Better late then never.So I have tried this deck on ygopro both online and against A.I. I can safely say that this deck is really fun consistent enough and suprisingly can hold their own against meta deck in this case nekroz and qliphort with no siding. Also the girls are cute so thats a bonus lol.Heres my experiences with the deck so far Most of the time my opening hands have either unpossessed or supply squad and at least one monster. Both make my opponent rather hesistant to attack also both of them give  when any monster destroyed. I never activate more than  supply squad and  unpossessed. familiarpossessed really is a good number and I havent found any differences when I run  each or  like you did. I didnt take soul charges because its a really good card in topdecking situation when I have no monster on the field. I also didnt side out Secret Village of the Spellcasters because the only case where its useless is when theres no possessedfamiliar that can be left alive on the field.The usuals Xyz thats summoned in midduel are D.R. XYZ Dragon  and crab king. I also add Exciton removing thunder spark dragon probably wont do it in real life lol.Im still thinking about taking out  Jigabyte for  Mathematician because Math target is just one nefarious.tldr love the deck its my most favourite deck now D,yugioh,crh9soy,3,t5_2rpe6

4081862,0,t3_37cand,The R Series sounds really interesting. If they are going to take old structure decks and release new decks with similar themes and some new cards there is a lot of room for improvement.With this monarch deck although it isnt guaranteed it seems pretty likely it will contain the  Vassal considering its got  Parallel Foil Commons which would be great for cards that have only  print and are for an archetype of boss monsters. The deck does contain new cards as well but who ever made common copies of new cards in recent structure decks? If it doesnt contain the vassal those  parallel foil commons will most likely be the Monarchs themselves.The better question is what else will we see in the R series? If we are assuming this is a remake of Structure Deck The Dark Emperor then we can assume a lot of the other R decks will be for a similar era of Structure decks. So if we look at old popular structure decks Id guess our best bets would be Spellcasters Command spell counters are in need of some tune up and we recently got that one Pendulum Spellcaster who utilized spellcounters. I wouldnt be surprised if this was the next R series deck released. Counters are in themselves just too slow for a meta where monsters dont stay on the field that long and since it is a theme that infrequently sees use across all of YuGiOhs life span it is pretty clear what will be made in the R series. Rise of the Dragon Lords EVERYONE LOVES DRAGONS. So why not release more dragons? This is other tributesummon deck for everyones favorite type Dragons. DRAGONS. And with a boss monster that seems ludicrous to summon now it would be cool to see this updated. Machine Revolt Ancient Gear are another... surprise surprise Tribute Summon deck. Ancient Gear centered around Golem and Gadjiltron Dragon as boss monsters both of which were slow to get out. The Machine Revolt deck included  spells which made it easier with Ancient Gear Castle and Ancient Gear Factory and they could easily do it again with new Machinespecific Pendulum monsters to get out the required tribute materials as well as better resource management.Of course there are other notable decks to add to the R series and each has their own reason to be added. Invincible Fortress An update I would like the most. Rocktype monsters are always under represented and their theme in general is slow drawnout play. On major issue is that defensive Rocktypes dont start getting good until the  star range where they require tributes... but especially now keeping monsters around long enough to tribute them is hard work. Getting some of the RockType specific anime support or completely new cards as well as reprinting cards from this deck would help make defensive RockType decks both playable and fun for the decks player anyways. What is really needed is some Sphinx support. Warriors Strike Lets not focus on the Warriortype aspect and instead focus on the Gemini aspect. This deck was designed to help Gemini get off the ground but didnt provide a very good direction for the typing. Other than giving us Pendulum monsters to get Gemini onboard so we can use out  normal summon a turn to activate their effects there are other things we could use. Cards with effect that specifically give Geminimonsters their effects that arent equip spells. Although Phoenix Gearfried Blazewing Butterfly Gemini Soldier and Gemini Summoner help us summon monsters quicker and get their effects they are either a gemini monster themselves OR get us the effects during the end phase. A card that lets us special summon a Gemini monster and immediately treat it as an effect monster is needed. VERY needed. Zombie World Zombies are always rogue and have some antimeta qualities but they havent been that good in a long while. We currently have P.M. Captor who is heavily designed towards a Zombietype Pendulum monster duo and would be very effective if we could get a second Pendulum for the type. Zombie monsters hate being in the hand and focus on summing from the Grave and sending cards to the Grave by some means but cards effecting the hand are some what low in numbers and Pendulum summons would go a long way to boost that. Given that P.M. Captor already has a scale of  all we need is another Zombie with a Scale of  and we will be fine. Plus given some zombietype support for Pendulum monsters in the Extra Deck we could really see Zombies shine. Lord of the Storm Features a boss monster which can only be Tribute Summoned... AND the tributes must be wind monsters. My god that is rough. The deck focuses on destruction amp control with harpies and cards like icarus attack to ensure your opponent takes burn damage from your boss while you dont. What could be used to pump this up? First off some means of getting multiple tributeable monsters on board and second still being able to tribute summon. What fits this? Pendulum summoning. WindSpecific pendulum monsters can really only be abused by Harpies but if they are tuned correctly you can stop their abuse and allow for strong plays with some fun Wind amp WingedBeast BackRow hate. Warriors Triumph Equipspell based WarriorType deck. Essentially you could just replace everything here with Noble Knights but if you want to bump this deck up you will have to do so VERY carefully. A boss monster that cant be special summoned benefits most from having Pendulumsummoned monsters as tribute material but seeing you are WarriorType if you dont properly limit the power youll have a highly abuseable set of cards.,yugioh,crlk3h7,7,t5_2rpe6

4124986,0,t1_crqg56a,Way back after ABYR dropped I wanted to play a deck I thought would be FUN. Nothing super competitive just some good old fun. Now back then the meta was a tad slower Mermail had just came out but they werent that amazing until CBLZ. Previously I had played WindUps Handloop and I did Shocklock a bit as well so the idea of combocentric decks had always been on my mind. I stumbled across Tiaramisu and browsed through the archetype. I was going to make it right then and there but due to financial reasons welcome to highschool  no job I put it on the backburner and honestly never touched the deck IRL until right around Anjelly was announced. As I said being a very big combo deck person Infernity had been a deck I was in love with. I played that shit and it was so great. The options and potential were almost limitless.Then one fateful day Sehabi won Worlds Canada represent! with Infernity and suddenly rest in peace my favorite monster.Now this brings me to why I came up with Trapless which actually started around the time DUEA came out. Everyone saying omg Madolche unviable because Midrash  special summon and Im sitting here like.. Ill just find a way to play around it. Cue my furious deck building for a solid  months until it hit me..Why play around any deck that is clearly stronger than me when I can just abuse my decks biggest strength? Ill kill you before you can even do anything. And thus Combo Cupcakes was born and I could not be happier with any deck creation Ive ever made. Its pretty much my magnum opus of deck building and the idea isnt even that original.,yugioh,crqh21s,3,t5_2rpe6

4218594,0,t1_cs134id,Oh come on no need to be all offended and make irrelevant points. I understand that it is dead without  monsters in hand all Im saying is that it extends elderremp and eldercanna as well as it helps get the engine started with any random tamerbeast. Youre right it makes some bricks worse ie tamer locked hands but honestly when Im tamer locked I usually lose anyway double summon or no double summon. Also its not as dead as you think. Even drawing it mid game allows you an extra fusion with a searched LaraWen or at the very least an extra Apelio summon and attack boost. Im definitely not saying it should be run in every build without exception but it does improve turn  consistency and thats a fact. Is it perfect? Far from it. But I think it definitely warrants a discussion instead of its an inherent  and isnt great late game so therefore its a terrible card.

That said they may go off of the fact that since its being played a lot and since if they hit Nekroz it would be the definitive best deck that it needs to be hit. I personally think the deck is fine and doesnt need a hit but if the deck does end up getting hit as I fear I think itll be a preemptive one.,yugioh,cs57i3v,2,t5_2rpe6

They both look very similar the shaddoll core came from a gemknight so it would be most natural to use a gemknight as its main body. Construct fuses itself with powerful monsters in the same way gemknights fuse with each other. And construct looks like it is made of stone and its Japanese name Nephelim implies a relation to children which lapis was one of the  gemknight children.

4364532,0,t1_cshlu89,Cards that are searched for via an effect that requires specific verification such as card type or statisticmust be shown to the opponent in their entirety. The opponent may read the retrieved card. Thisverification must be done in a timely manner as to not hold up the current Duel.    This is the official rule. It does not specify whether searching itself requires or does not require any revealing. It simply states when you have to reveal when you search. A general rule to avoid confusion what the question was looking for is called a rule of thumb and an exception is not based entirely on the parameters of the rule it is meant to convey but instead it means to provide the general consensus of the rule in regards to the most applications. Most methods of search do have specific restrictions So many in fact that you yourself did not manage to remember one off the top of your head that didnt which is why many would say that the general rule would be searching most cards would require you to reveal. However this is not the case with the example I provided. That being said  case out of many that goes against a rule of thumb does not generally suggest that the rule of thumb is wrong instead it suggests that the  case stated is an exception.   For example a rule of thumb in life would be that if you fall out of a plane at cruising altitude you will die. This is a very good rule of thumb to judge if you want to fall out of a plane or not in regards to whether you would want to die or not. There HAVE been a case where someone who fell out of a plane at cruising altitude survived. Now this doesnt mean the previous rule of thumb is wrong because it disproves the rule  theory instead it means that this case is an exception. You can still expect to die if you fall out of a plane at cruising altitude.    ,yugioh,cshm8o7,1,t5_2rpe6

4495361,0,t3_3cnnow,Hello! Luckily I saw your post. I used to play Ally of Justice a long time ago to combat Lightsworns. Im just a huge mecha fan in general so AoJ sat really well with me.First of all know that Ally of Justice has no search capabilities. You arent playing competitively but you will still be at a loss to other casual decks that have good search capabilities. To combat this you can run Tin Goldfish to play with another Level  to XYZ into Gear Gigant X. Alternatively you can Run Iron Call.Ally of Justice just make excellent techs against LIGHT matchups overall. While this is a good thing its also bad against nonLIGHT matchups. Since they were designed to battle the invading Worms they dont have much functionality outside of that. This is where DNA Transplant comes in handy. Though this will conflict on specific cards like Light Imprisoning Mirror or AoJ Nullfier other cards like Cosmic Gateway work from the hand so youre good.Genex on the other hand are best for Synchro summoning. The Genex Ally lineup focuses on monsters that can change their Attribute which in turn will Synchro into Ally Triarm or Triforce and depending on your situation will handle threats accordingly.If your monsters are totally Machine you can also use Rivalry of Warlords and Solidarity for the extra beat. Just remember that Ally of Justice is best used for their technical capabilities rather than offensive power. I would personally avoid cards like Unlimiter so I can focus on technical play.An excellent card you can use is Black Salvo. Since most of your Level  will be DARK you can go into an instant Level  Synchro. My personal favorite play is to search this out with Gear Gigant X then Normal summon Black Salvo when possible Synchro Karakuri Shogun mdl  Burei then use its ability to summon another Karakuri like Nanashick and used with Solidarity you can dominate the game if done early enough. Machina Armored Unit will also help you swarm if used right.Cyber Dragon pretty much a staple in any machine deck.It also goes without saying that any machine deck should run Limiter Removal.Other notes Genex Ally Birdman is such a good card. Im currently playing T.G. Aliens casually and this card is so amazing for going into an easy Beelzeus. Good luck and dont forget to stock up on your traps! ,yugioh,csxaq9v,3,t5_2rpe6

Reqliate acts differently to skill drain because Reqliate has to activate on each summon because it is a mandatory effect it goes to chain link  unless your opponents monster has a mandatory on summon effect which means if I were to summon trishula while it is face up it goes Reqliate cl trishmanju etc CL. Resolve that backwards trish and manju get their effects before they are negated by Reqliate. ,yugioh,cszu2jw,1,t5_2rpe6

4623677,0,t1_ctda1xb,Its still pretty stale I think. B.A mainly changed play styles because denko kind of stopped the whole summon Dante set  thing plus more BA monsters allowed them to be turbo. Qlis havent changed much theyre still very floodgate.dek towers turbo is a bit of a change but it seems limited to Europe. Nekroz hasnt changed at all except now they just cant djinn lock you. Shaddolls are the only deck to really morph they were first a soul charge deck with lightsworns. Once soul charge was limited they became kind of stun based with super poly. They were head to head with BA after their release and once qlis were released they were hanging on by a thread until they turned into a balls to the wall OTK deck with denko and enemy controller. Once nekroz came out and that was no longer viable they were hanging on by a thread again until they morphed into a stun deck with mistake. While seeing shaddolls morph has been interesting I still wish we had something to change it up. Or at least some movement in the tier list to make things at least a little different. And Im not looking forward to magicians or majespecters. They are absolute cancer. ,yugioh,ctddzxu,2,t5_2rpe6

Castel  and Exciton Knight are all very powerful monsters and can answer the ridiculous monsters that cant be destroyed and whatnot. These options are what make the game Yugioh. Flexibility is a good thing. Being allowed to choose which monster to summon at a moments notice is good for the game.Also I find it kind of funny that youre okay with Fusions and not Synchros when Synchros are so similar to Fusions.,yugioh,ctfzwe9,6,t5_2rpe6

4670852,0,t3_3ewyy9,DM  because of nostalgia. There are some great duels but overall the story is basically finding Atems name which never interested me. GX Seasons   . Season  . First seasons were terrible and everything seemed like filler and Judai being such a Mary Sue. Season  was fantastic due to how dark it got. I loved the seriousness of it.Ds . Now Im going to be crucified for sure. Ds is the bestsecond best ever! How could you?! Yeah yeah I get it. Heres my beef with it. Crows addition to the main cast screwed over the Dark Signer arc prevented Lua from becoming a Signer then he was to duel Bombar as Life Stream Dragons effect counters Bombars strategy that decimated Lua back in the tourney Demak was ignored and thats just the first season. Second was pretty much due to Carlys VA being in some Japanese cult so they rewrote Yliaster from being an ancient cult to cyborgs from the future. Also thanks to cult thing Carlys strong role in the first season and being Jacks true love got thrown down the drain. Also again from the cult thing Arcadia just stopped being a thing and was most likely what left Aki with nothing for her in Season . Way to kill a characters development and importance by taking away her psychic abilities out of no where. Yeah she got a D Wheel but still.Also the amount of Yusei duels seriously dude give someone else the spotlight and throwing characters shown early on out the window. Remember Yuseis friends from Satellite? Cant even recall their names. Tanner and the old man? Also stopped being relevant.So thats what I think of Ds. It was okay with what they were able to work with but they had to close doors to larger potential for Season  and rushed through the end of Season .Zexal . Does this even need explanation? Yuma definitely gained the most development out of any of the previously mentioned protags starting from the bottom of the barrel to becoming the champion and arguably a godlike figure due to fusing with Astral into Zexal when he needed to topdeck a ZW. But you just cant like him. Very unappealing character and dude had so many Xyz monsters whyd he always decide Better summon Hope. Shark and Kaito were alright really filled with angst and hatred for a while. Liked that Kaito died that was something I didnt think Id see from the anime an onscreen death. Shark becoming a Barian was unexpected and felt like a last minute plot twist. Meh.Arc V Cant rate due to not completed but loving it! Lot of characters that are getting screentime so thats fixed from Ds problem of Yusei all day. They have decks that are actually good the different summoning methods is fantastic the dimensions thing is still confusing but more will be revealed as it goes on. Fanservice from Ds characters isnt needed but more than welcomed if the plan is to tie the yugioh series together somehow with Arc V. We have Jack and Crow in Synchro could we see some of Zexals ignored sidecharacters if theyre part of Kurosakis Rebellion. Fusion would be cool to see Dark Zane being a higherup officer with his Cybers ruling over the Ancient Gear using Academia soldiers. Again just speculation since they threw in Ds characters. Theres a lot of doors Arc V can explore and seeing which one they take and execute will be interesting.,yugioh,ctjb9ro,1,t5_2rpe6

4732661,0,t3_3fqp8l,I keep seeing a lot of mixed opinions about this one but honestly I enjoy it. In all honesty I havent played any yugioh games since TF. The story duels are fun especially trying to use the story decks theres a lot of cards and the game is pretty generous with giving you new cardspacks battle challenges are kind of neat though some do get out of hand and I like the draft mode. Granted there are some issues I have with it.The deck building screen isnt really that great. Its kind of of tedious to use especially if you dont know the name of a cardI wish there were puzzles again I know some people didnt really care for them but I always enjoyed them.I really wish there was a way to open multiple packs at once.Likewise there not being any kind of checklist for cards is kind of weirddisappointingThe achievements could have been a bit more time consuming andor difficult.

4766160,0,t1_ctv5kru,yes u misread because u have never played this deck before nor the matchup at all. banishing mirrors is an essential part of the matchup that comes up literally every game the fact that u do not know this reflects through ur uneducated posts. im not sure why u are still responding at this point but scrolling through ur post history u seem to have a history of downvotes and u tend to argue just for the sake of arguing so im going to take that u are a troll who has nothing better to do than making a series of embarassing posts.gtYou say floaters dont matter and giving them advantage by using harm a destruction effect doesnt matter then you go on to say that harm is better because it wont bounce valk back. Stop being a hypocrite.im not even sure how to respond to this at all. maybe u should reread the nekroz of valkyrus to understand why returning it to their hand isnt a very good idea.gtPlease tell me how often you are going to even draw into harm OR antra?u really dont even have an argument anymore. this is one of the most desperate attempts i have ever seen. by your logic we should stop playing raigeki because its  in  and we never draw into it right? please tell me how this is even relevant to the topic at hand ie. harmadik vs antra. u need to learn the definition of anecdotal evidence. u also just linked me to the past  months of general tournaments that include nonpremier events such as regionals. do u even think before u post? ill be honest u really have no idea what you are talking about. if u are so confident then u are welcome to play for me any amount of money on dn or simply to try and prove ur point by winning even though that will never happen. i suggest u grind dn rated to get a better understanding of competitive yugioh.,yugioh,ctvbgsg,1,t5_2rpe6

4816707,0,t1_cu1k6pv,Theyre actually right. If you never draw upstart that means youre basically playing form a  card deck anyway. If all your upstarts are at the bottom of the deck then theres  cards youll see before upstart and the reason you run upstart is because those are the cards you want to see more often instead of three random extra cards. The thing is that you can never guarantee that your three upstart  or three whatever other card  will be at the bottom. It overall makes your deck more consistent because when you do draw it you get to see the next card. But if you never draw upstart its because youre seeing the next card anyway and youre doing it without giving your opponent  LP. ,yugioh,cu1ooi9,2,t5_2rpe6

An older Asian gentleman  who looking back had the patience of a friggin saint dueled me and tried to teach as his procedurally evisceration of my life points begin at the hands of his Gate Guardian. I remember him saying he bought a whole case of MRD. Crazy to really be able to reflect upon a memory having a lot more knowledge of YGO now.BTW kids like me are cancer.

4857951,0,t3_3hdmip,I think ryko is a bit slow in general it be better purposed as a solar recharge. No one was every hurt from an allure of darkness which could be a better choice than Sephlon cause it seems to be dead for the first couple turns yes it is  atkpotential out to towers so move him to the side plus star eater in your extra does it better but just makes you win HARDER and wont add to consistency. I feel it would be better to have either  honest or  Necro Gardna not  of each and since i suggested you add allure  Necro would make sense. I would move Royal Decree to the side deck cause some decks only run some traps and wont be hurt from the decree and I think Needlebug would serve a better purpose there as it gets the ball rolling when your milling gets negated by your opponent. DAD I feel like i want to take it out but its iffy it can be a searchable allure target of some sorts. having the one eclipse and one collapserpent seems like a small engine but better run at . so get ride of the gorz imo and also one wulf  or leave eclipse and collapse at one idc. but with the extra micheal is only needed at  and the second for a rank  add to the tool box. no goyo I think anything does eff only in the bp is bad but some people like it so keep it of you want i would recommend a leviair sea dragon in its place.  is better than maestroke and can also survive a jd nuke but steals the monster instead of flipping it. I personally dont like starliege and would swap it out for a daigusto to recover your boss monster if milled. steelswarm is not good in this format it is good against synchro spam and another lightsworn deck and heiratic and they are all rogue decks so its is better purposed as a dire wolf maybe? Also add galaxy cyclone to  do what ever it takes to add that bad boy. now for credentials I cant prove anything but have sucked that lightsworn dick since  and I think i have an understanding of the deck and what NOT to use. this is my current build   and holy fuck no one knows what hit them turn two. considering minerva is a ycs prize card im buying it off someone i have a job and buying that mf as quick as possible ,yugioh,cu6vqbp,2,t5_2rpe6

4867819,0,t3_3hiztm,In the OCG Performage and Pals are the best at this. Simply because of Flame Mascot and its interaction with Dracoslayer.Flame Mascot summons a Performage from the deck whenever it is destroyed and that works if he was a scale at that moment. So opening him  Dracoslayer means you get a Mascot search another in Extra a Performage on the field and a Dracoslayer as a scale out of two cards.The second iteraction is of course Performapal Pendulum Wizard and Flame Mascot. Wiz can destroy up to two of your cards to search that many Pals. So destroying Mascots lets you search  and SS usually Jugglers that will search stuff again...,yugioh,cu84j1d,1,t5_2rpe6

4935910,0,t1_cugofec,Ultimately triple Dante helps the deck out in a number of ways. First and foremost hes an easy to make  beatstick whose effect allows you to potentially trigger effects of other BA monsters that either detach as material or hit the grave via Dantes mill effect. This allows you to potentially make more plays and a third Dante means yet another power monster. If your opponent gets rid of two you still have that third one to fall back on. Plus Dante gets you any BA card back from your graveyard once he hits the grave including another Dante besides himself back to the extra in that case whereas anything else is added to hand from grave. So he nets you a  in terms of advantage. The CirDante loop is commonly seen here. Ultimately that third Dante could help a lot. If the two Dantes are gone youre limited in what else you can play considering all the BA monsters die immediately of theres a nonBA monster on your side of the field. If you lose two Dante you can still make the third plus another rank  or Virgil. With only  its much more difficult to swarm.  I know a third Dante would really help in the mid and late stages of the game for that reason alone. ,yugioh,cugplmq,1,t5_2rpe6

4980446,0,t3_3j4yji,You have the general idea of a Quasar deck sorted. But there is a lot of improvements you could make to it.First off Plant Quasar is somewhat slow compared to Synchron Quasar. However both are viable options.I would still recommend taking outSporeGlowup Bulbboth Effect VeilerGorzand Chaos Sorcerer.Then add in another Quickdraw and Tuningware. Quickdraw is vital to get level  synchros out. Tuningware is for added draw power. Then your going to want to put in  Rush Warrior. This will allow you to recycle your Junk Synchron and Quickdraw Synchron. Finally add in  Jet Synchron. This little guy is a level  tuner that will search out synchrons and can be special summoned from the graveyard. This is a great card.Thats it for main deck monsters.For Spells cardsYou dont really need Dark hole Space Typhoon or forbidden lance.  Although these are all good cards QuasarSifr is the only real card you need and will offer you the protection. For you see Quasar decks are very hit or miss.The reason I said Plant Quasar is not as good as synchron Quasar is because the former doesnt have any real recovery plans where as synchron quasar can at least mount a second offensive.Now then add in  upstart goblins  Desynchro Chicken Game and a one day of peace. All of these cards offer draw power. Desynchro is best used on formula synchron or a  synchro that has tuningware has material. This will allow you to get a good amount of draw power and consistency. Add in soul charge too this will make it easier to mount a second offensive or make a QuasarSifr again after making the first.Then youll want to add Inferno Reckless summon. This will allow you to get out a lot of material to work with. For example use this on a tuningware and youve got a easy  card draw. Lastly for spells add in  limitover drive.As for traps take them all out. Its an OTK deck your making and due to the nature of Quasar decks its pretty much rock or bust. So go balls to the wall make a quasar and then sit on it. Now for the extra deck formula is perfectTake out armory arm and put in T.G. Recipro Dragonfly. Now why would you want dragonfly? Simple this is a nontuner level  synchro monster. So you can use it Accel synchro and another level  synchro to make a quasarsifr. Now Take out Road Warrior Stardust Dragon Black Rose Dragon and junk archer. These cards dont help you achieve your goal much. Road Warrior can summon monsters i know but you dont want to aim for road warrior.Now add in a Divine Spark Dragon Sifr Quasars sister a Stardust assault warrior Ally of justice Catastor Dark Diviner and Child Dragon.These synchro monsters will benefit you greatly. Sifr gives protection to everything Assault Warrior has a neat summon effect and is also a Stardust warrior target Ally of justice is a generic level  dark diviner can be made easy via Junk Synchron and Level eater. Is also a level  that cant be destroyed by battle and child dragon can use monsters in your hand as material for a synchro summon.I hope this helps you! Ask me anything you wanna know! ,yugioh,cumbmpp,2,t5_2rpe6

4988915,0,t3_3iq57q,Completely normal. When I first got back into yugioh I was a working teenager who had disposable income. I was reliving my childhood and buying all the structure decks and packs that I couldnt buy when I was a kid gave me a special kind of joy that could only be provided by nostalgia.     The next natural progression for me and potentially for you will be to actually play the game since you did buy all those cards. Youll want to play the structure decks and put new cards in them to make them better youll want to read up on the decks and see what others are doing to make it better to take ideas from them and youll want to play in tournaments.    Eventually the joy you had from buying all the random decks and packs from before will be marginalized since youve been doing it for a while and youll want to do well in tournaments. The next step will be to build optimal tier  decks and the easiest way you can do that is by buying singles.      Honestly what youre doing is the best way to get into this game. Youre discovering the game with your friends instead of subscribing to an established regime. Youll eventually figure out the way to pick this game up as a hobby instead of a nostalgic phase. Most of the redditors on ryugioh are already past this stage. But for you just enjoy yourself.,yugioh,cuncl57,2,t5_2rpe6

4997399,0,t1_cuoa2ck,Im not a fan of Psuedo space alongside Chicken Game in the deck because it always felt really dead to me since I didnt always go for Chicken Game with my terraforming searchessometimes if you have a level   Anjelly already in hand its better to go for Chateau instead. Im actually trying out Dark World Dealings in the deck for more deck thinning since I can just toss my dead combo pieces into the grave to get shuffled back through chateau if i need to. Its working pretty well if I dont have a good target in hand to discard it feels a little bad but if I dont have a single target for DWD it probably means I have either Nat BeastDecree combo or Regular Anjelly  Level . Also I figured out last night that Kamionwizard  Performage Trapeze Magician is basically a better version of Karbonala  Blade Armor Ninja in the deck. Basically you lose the Mewfuille  Hootcake  level  SS monster OTK against a clear field that you had with Blade Armor Ninja but instead you gain a stronger OTK with Anjelly  Level   Instant Fusion. Right now Anjelly  Instant Fusion  Level  that end results into Leviair  Chocolatalamode Blade Armor Ninja does  damage to the opponent. BUT with Kamionwizard  Trapeze Magician your combo ends up with Leviair  Chocolatalamode  Trapeze Magician for  damage. Pretty much I like it more because it has you special summon Magileine off ticket instead of Messengelato which is nice because if your OTK gets stopped or something like that its better to have messengelato in deck to combo again instead of Magileine. Its also better because the extra  ATK you do pushes you over the threshold of being able to use  upstart goblin and still have an OTK. If youre curious about the decklist you can find it here Gotta say that  Deck thinningsearching cards feels pretty good in Madolche. ,yugioh,cuodg3p,1,t5_2rpe6

Its normalspecial summon effect is too good to pass upIts a WIND attribute which outside of needing certain HERO fusion requirements is not a powerful attribute at the moment.Can essentially be a bad late game card due to the likeliness of having little to no search targets as HERO decks tend to power search very often and quickly.Has no effect of being sent to graveyard unlike Shadow MistCard Effect Rating  A I personally think that people STRONGLY underestimate an ECallMST on  card.

The scales swing just like a pendulum in a grandfather clock. With the monster in the pendulum zones they summon to the point of time where they can reach equilibrium between them field.When pendulums die they dont stay the graveyard because they get thrown into a time loop where they are still alive extra deck.

Pretty much all of them in my opinion. They have went so long without any of them really being hit aside from Qliphort and Nekroz.gt Sure Tour Guide got limited but thats not an actual BA card albeit it was the best card in their deck because it looped TGUScarmDanterepeat with Scarm.gt I think Shaddolls will get something done with El Shaddoll Fusion maybe a hit on El Shaddoll Construct to two because coupled with Trapeze Magician it can hit for  dump a card on its summon because of her effect and then if it was Trapezed you just get to add back a fusion anyway.gtDante will maybe get a hit being its their best card it may go down to  because of the amount of times BA has toppedwon events despite Nekroz being the t deck still.gtNekroz will get a hit regardless nearly the entire community has been saying they need it and I do agree but hopefully they wont just butcher the deck like I see a few people are hoping for.gtTellars... worlds...

Tony Jays spirit needs to come back and voice Dennis for that one line when the dub reaches episode  Again with this  special opening? They really like driving it into the ground. I wanted the actual opening one last time since this will be the last time we Hanate our monstas c Oh poor Yuya. This will be the th time he gets broken because of this revelation Reiji freaking Akaba. Keikaku doori all day every day. That center council guy though rubs me the wrong day Geez man that is a big monster. Makes Rev Falcon look so tiny Staring intensifies Raidraptor trap hype! Dennis says nope.avi to that And Yuyas in complete denial Dennis is just nope.aviing all over Shun. Aint having none of these Falcons and their anti special summon effects today. This is a pretty big boss monster for Ancient Gears. Going to be a long wait for the Fusion version of High Speed Riders and Wing Raiders to get this guy printed Dennis is just wrecking crap and Jack Atlas aint amused. He looks so ready to Burning Soul on this monster Oh hai Yuto. Nice of you to drop by on this trip down memory lane of death and destruction Gatta say loving the animation. Theyre really making it as brutal as can be Oh hey that level  RR isnt complete garbage! Story time by Dennis!  Time to see pre invasion Heartland! So Dennis was undercover in the Xyz dimension hence his use of Xyz summoning. Interesting I see a Ruri! Trapeze Magician in for the swing! This is totally one of the broest monsters in the franchise Man Dennis really does love being a performer and having fun but sadly duty calls c Oh hai Yuri. This shot of him and Dennis standing on top of rubble is pretty great So thats her bracelet. I wonder what its powers are along with Serenas and Rins. ArcV hurry up and put more emphasis on Serena Rin and Ruri! gt Oh Yuri how I wish to see what you can truly do. Dennis pressed the Ruri button. You shouldnt have done that Dennis OH SHOOT ITS SORA! New Rank Up! Shun is skipping the rank  and going str to ! Satellite Cannon Falcon! Oh hell yes the hype is real with Satellite Cannon Falcon! Whats better than carpet bombing? LASER BEAMS! Yuyas going Berserk! I repeat Yuyas going Berserk! The hype is real! And Yuya finally understands SCREW EGAO! Man if Yuya remains in a constant state of mild Berserk thatd be pretty ballin Dennis is just not having a good day KUROSAKI IS FIRIN HIS LAZAH!!! SHOOP DA WHOOP! They could not make this any more hype Byyyyyeeeeeeee Dennis! And of course the crowd goes wild That Sora hype. Jack is not amused. No one is amused. The stadium got wrecked hard And of course Reiji is screwing with Shun by getting rid of his card making tech in his disk Thats a good question Yuzu. Why does Leo want you  girls? Explain ArcV explain! So the council flat out admits it doesnt want a war? Some allies Synchro will be... Yuyas ultimate war ending weapon Egao! Speaking of egao the last time well have an Arc of Egao c Even now knowing how all  girls look like we still get three Yuzus in the ending OH SHOOT! ROGER IS TICKED! COUP DETAT TIME!

5476632,0,t3_3q3014,Trim down the deck  cards makes it hard to draw what you need. Shadow Mist is ideally run at  if possible with  Dark Laws. Most of the Normal Hero monsters are redundant along with Wildheart unless you really want to use the Wind Fusions in which case Avian is your only option to summon them. Card Trooper Winged Kuriboh and Honest dont really do anything for the deck. Parallel World fusion takes too much setup outside of decks based around Fusion Gate so dont really bother with it. Form Change is also pretty situational. As far as the rest goes IamtheTrumans build is probably one of the best ones you could get from the Structure Decks. Itll do perfectly fine if youre looking for fun on a budget.,yugioh,cwbovz4,2,t5_2rpe6

5533250,0,t1_cwipgr7,Gishki in general are dark as FUCK.Theyre two parts Shadow Over Innsmouth three parts death cultists. Every single Ritual Monster of theirs is in actuality a combination of one or two people within the cult itself and it is the only tribe within the Terminal World to be considered a cult at all. Its also implied that barring the rituals done unto Noellia herself as she dies looking like her usual self none of these Rituals are reversible and everyone who is offered up is effectively dead. And also half of her cult being literal fish people doesnt help much.And Noellia? Oh jesus what a bag of nuts. To cut her story short she was one of two people from the Ice Barrier tribe and part of the faction who were against releasing the seals on Trishula the other was Natalia the mother of Avance and inheritor of her sword and for very good reason of course. But they also understood that they couldnt just let the Wurms win and while every other tribe had their reliable aces the Ice Barriers didnt have much else. So the two try to summon a tribe of monsters sealed below the Earth and control their power. Natalia fails dies and their seal is undone without anyone not even them knowing and they of course take a vessel to use so their will can be done.She was actually a very nice person before all this Gishki nonsense! After The Storm depicts her comforting a young Avance EriaAriel WynnWinda and her own daughter Emilia. By the lack of Natalia in the picture and the strange inclusion of Caam comforting Pilica the Lswarm influence sat dormant in her for a long time until the Steelswarm themselves rise from the Earth and Noellia makes Contact with the Aquamirror.And that is when you see Noellia become more bloodthirsty insane and utterly depraved willing to sacrifice her own daughter in a faulty ritual what Aquamirror Illusion implies happened to Gustkraken since thats the Ritual ver. of Emilia just to have an extra body for her army. Of course she eventually revived Emilia and fought off Zielgigas with the last of her own Ice Barrier magic but she keels over when the second Terminal arc is done.,yugioh,cwix69x,19,t5_2rpe6

Now everyone and their mother has some kind of way around Shaddolls bag of tricks barring clown shenanigans and theyre okay. Obviously they still curbstomp older decks by sheer advantage gain but newer decks were designed with Shaddolls in mind. BA have also fallen out of favor if only because Nekroz bullied them out of sight. Hell Nekroz are starting to see losses due to people seeing through all of their very very transparent plays and cards like Shared Ride even the board for Nekrozs opponents the way Maxx C did for Special Summon spam decks back in the day.Konami could have released all the new cards and still make bank off of packs boxes and the tins while letting the meta deal with the newer contenders. Shaddolls would have even more decks that barelyever play off of the Extra Deck to deal with BAs would still need to fear Nekroz while fighting everyone else and thats the truth of it.These arent good ban hits.

5697255,0,t1_cx3ahv2,It was and is a very poorly designed card which people just say oh dont play the game unless you have effect negation otherwise its just your fault! Say youre opponent is down to  cards and you have  on board  monsters and some archetype spelltraps maybe an MST. They excition and youre like AH HA i have a veiler for this situation! then it goes to you turn and you cant go into the battlephase until youve dealt with it basically calling for a castel Dire or  in most decks. meaning it ALWAYS payed for itself unless the summon got responding too. I stole and lost too many games just to that card. They set  MST and a monster for the first turn after a search or  then you just excition first for a free  on them then go off and its like okay this card is balanced.,yugioh,cx3as74,-1,t5_2rpe6

He is very useful and I still play owl but I also play king for added consistency. You never want to have a hand where you cannot fusion summon your frightfurs so king and owl both help to add consistency to fluffals. In order for toy vendor to really be at full potential you need a lot of fluffals which usually means playing  mouse.

I realize that Wightprince at  is only strong in my lightsworn build since it increases the chance that I can sack into it. In your build I would suggest swapping out a pyramid turtle and the goblin zombie for zombie masters because it seems a bit stronger imo.

While I do believe that the OCG Can Be An important source of information some people like to follow it more than what will actually be happening here.

I am not I enjoy both games I appreciate yugiohs fast pace and unique mechanics such as the extra deck and at its core not being a resource based game. It has enough design space to become a truly great game given proper support. I dare say that if you take yugiohs history at any point and eliminate the top tier decks what would remain is a healthy diverse and engaging meta game. Yugiohs biggest problem is that power creep is not a byproduct of new and interesting cards its a tool to sell new sets. ,yugioh,cxp7db7,0,t5_2rpe6

5884783,0,t1_cxr0myq,Not quite.  If your opponent already has their Scales set and they attempt a Pendulum Summon thats not the effect of a Spell Card activating or the effect of a Spell Card in general.  It is just a type of Summoning in general.  You can negate the Summon with cards like Solemn Warning and Grand Horn of Heaven because they indicate the negation of Summons.If you wanted to negate the activation of the Pendulum Scales like as in preventing them from setting the Scales in the first place you have to go with a Spellnegating card or effect.

AntiSpell Fragrance also prevents them from activating Scales because Pendulum Monsters cannot be set facedown in the Pendulum Zones.,yugioh,cxr11gi,2,t5_2rpe6

They can still do a lot of fancy stuff with  Rekindling like card Nova but thats way less consistent than it used to be. Even now I dont really understand the limit of Rekindling.

I would definitely consider maxxing out on twin twisters because it is amazing. Also really consider   fiendish rhino because they really help with the extra consistency. Solemn warning is also a a better solemn notice that you can put in. Personally I am really like  fire lake and  traveller but I understand if it seems excessive.

6390586,0,t1_czg0m01,PePe is not linear because you can throw down IgnisterInfinitywhatever in a single turn and OTK its merely very good at what it does and that is summoning massive amounts of level s. Sure PePe can just vomit their extra deck out against rogue decks because they often cant counter the sheer speed but the strategy of speed and aggression doesnt play itself and in the mirror has an incredible amount of plays and misplays possible. The deck searches itself so much that almost every play can be achieved a dozen ways and the complexity is in deciding which of many plays can break an opponents board safely and if you can set up a good board of your own. The duels tend to be fast but thats not an indicator of skill or ease of use. But I digress I suppose youre after a deck that doesnt have a linear win condition of OTKsoft lock insanely quickly? From your posts I get the vibe that you like to grind games out and search for appropriate reactionary plays. Off of the top of my head decks like PSYFrames Scythe ControlHATArtfact Control and maybe Majespecter work?  PSYFrames are a very reactionary slow deck that relies on carefully negating the right cards and keeping your own field clear HAT and its variants are similarly themed control decks that require careful trap management to stop aggressive decks and Majespecters are very good at setting up and searching reactionary plays. ,yugioh,czg1kw1,1,t5_2rpe6

I came up with this build of the deck by combining a Brilliant Fusion deck with a Synchro Fusionist deck.I wont detail the full Quasar combo but its probably more simple than the Trishula loop but all you need is Brilliant Fusion and Junk Synchron. You end up summoning Quasar with these as synchro materials Accel Synchron Mist Bird Clausolas and your level  synchro of choice.,yugioh,czgbuik,1,t5_2rpe6
6394577,0,t1_czg4syq,FWIW most of the jargon in my comment are just names for cards that can be played in a specific order. Overall though the game has become a lot more complex and fast over time. Many decks can search themselves out and have multiple card effects per card so there are huge amounts of options and plays to make from turn to turn. I find it makes the game more fun but its also much faster and prone to one turn kills. ,yugioh,czghwwi,2,t5_2rpe6

6426074,0,t1_czjyit7,I dont have a list because I dont play Kozmo but a few of my friends play it and its really really good. Its basically a standard Kozmo build but it maxes out on Tincan Soartroopers Dark Destroyers obviously Call of the Haunteds and  oasis of dragon souls. The deck also only plays  farmgirl  wickedgood witch and  forerunner. I suggested to play one for one in the deck as well and its been doing well for my friend so maybe try that as well. The goal of Tincan Turbo is to make kozmos play as if theyre pendulums. The deck floods the board with as many big ships as possible and it loops Tincan every single turn until you OTK which you probably will by the second or third turn. The reason for soartroopers is so you can go into levair and get tincan onto the field to use his effect over and over again and also you can summon straw man out from grave then straw man summons a big ship from the banish zone so off of  soartrooper you have  cards on field. I think this is the best and most consistent of the Kozmo builds and people should ABSOLUTELY be playing this version a lot more.     ,yugioh,czjzrqi,1,t5_2rpe6

The card itself is not broken it is just better than Master Pend. Draco Pals can still utilize great synergy cards that PEPE has no room for. For example without Luster you will need to run  Master Pend and that is still a viable target for DracoFace Off and Rescue Rabbit. You can now run more copies of Instant Fusion for the Norden plays. Also the extra deck now opens up spot for Ragnazero Evilswarm Nightmare and Rafflesia in one deck. Along with those the deck now has room for Ariadne and Solemn Strikes. Lastly since you will be running Vector and Master Pend all of which are normal monsters you can now play Unexpected Dai in the deck. The deck is still very very powerful. ,yugioh,czotvq8,1,t5_2rpe6

6547975,0,t3_45b6lx,Since Ive already watched the key moments of the episodes because I was a Curious George Ill just give a quick summary of my thoughts down below Holy shit the four Yus merging together is a lot more serious than I thought. The four of them saying they will become one and Yuri approaching Yugo so creepily like hes in some cult is nuts. And then there was that giant hole forming up in the clouds. Holy crap whatever the original Yutagonist is its not a very nice being. Everyone is guaranteed to be screwed if the Yus become one. Serenas bracelet. What the hell does it actually do? It sure as heck isnt stopping this party! Its basically just letting us know that the plot is about to begin! Speaking of bracelets though the real party pooper just completely killed the momentum of everything. Thanks for doing so Yuzus bracelet. Things went from  to  real quick and then the bracelet dropped it down to  just as fast. Bye Yugo and Yuri! See you guys in  episodes when we maybe find out where the both of you got zapped to. Please dont be killed Yugo! Also Yuya went straight into the ceiling and got real acquainted with gravity. Nice going Yuzu if this wasnt an anime you would have killed him. So this entire we will become one thing was nothing but a giant tease. I wonder if Eichiro Oda is a writer for this show because ArcV is on the level of One Piece with its teasing of future events and keeping us in the dark. Hai Sergey! Why did you just take an intrusion penalty? Hi Earthbound support! You look nice! Especially your card that lets you make fusion and synchro at once. Chris LeBlanc would have a field day with that card Bye Barrett! It was nice seeing you again! Also thank you for being smart and realizing you can still take Serena even after losing at a card game. Bye Serena! Well see you in  episodes with your sisters counterparts Yuya is at an incredible disadvantage against Sergey with only  life and two neutered dragons. I mean OddEyes Rebellion is good but apparently not good enough against Earthbounds. At least he ditched Smile World. Some nice symbolism there that probably foreshadows Yuyas future development. Also Ninja Bro with that save! Speaking of development Sergey suddenly became Iron Man with his rocket boots! Holy crap this is amazing! The Ninjas get put down Sergey grabs his target and the dude is just GONE! Bye Yuzu! Next episode HYPE! JACK FREAKING ATLAS TAKES THE STAGE!!! Yuya is organizing a rescue team for Yuzu!

6592030,0,t1_d00lkps,I was pretty much thinking exactly this. I decided not to buy Pirmais but maybe I should have just because having a level  would be useful. Im running Piaty and Sjette as filler because I have to Infernoids need lots of Infernoids to work well. normal summons really is too many. Too often Im looking at my hand and thinking do I normal summon a Lightsworn or Decatron? Thunder King has been super super clutch though. I think I really would rather run Lumina than Lyla maindeck though. Lumina chains for huge mills and easy synchro for Michael with Raiden is the best.I do have  Instant Fusion and  Norden. Is it that good just to synchro for  or  or rank  plays? I would rather streamline the Infernoid game plan.I dont have Stardust Spark but I definitely have Stardust Dragon. I can easily cut GemKnight Pearl because I will very rarely have two level s out with this build I have. I just picked up a Chanbara for Deskbots yesterday. I need to remember throw a Blackwing Nothung in here. I really want to get Alsei but I dont think Ive seen one in anyones binder out here. I just traded my Ultimaya Tzolkin yesterday but I can probably get another one somewhere. Looks like I can use it to summon Michael the Arch Lightsworn so thats awesome. I also own Exploder Dragonwing and Light End Dragon and could do some shenanigans with those especially when going for Piaty kills DI do have End of Anubis I forgot thats an important side deck card for Infernoids.

There are plenty of effect monsters with lackluster effects. The point is they still HAVE the effect whether it be ideal or not therefore making them effect monsters and not vanillas. gt What does Vergil do beside being a  beater outside of BA?Hes a synchro that can let you draw a card upon destruction. Should anyone run him for that sole effect? No probably not but the effect is still there and that makes him not a vanilla in non BA decks. gt But he has that effect so why even trying to discuss? Because its relevant to the argument by having the same secondary effect.gt Also Math is a Effect monster that has other uses and his draw effect is way more likely to happen than Vergils thanks to the smaller body.Also Vergil is an effect monster that has other uses and his draw effect is still a draw effect whether its more likely to happen or not so your point holds no relevancy in the argument of whether or not Vergil is a vanilla synchro in non BA decks. ,yugioh,d0223lx,1,t5_2rpe6

I never said anything to suggest I have a problem with spelling everyone makes mistakes so I have no idea where you got that from I just think that people should use standard terms and the TCG card names where possible and when talking about the TCG so that everyone can join in with the discussion.

This will let you search out your god cards and can protect them from your opponents card effects as long as they target.Next you need to decide on an engine. I personally recomment the Monarch engine  It revolves around tribute summons locks your opponent out of plays and gives you free tributes for your god cards or the high level monarchs if you elect to run those. The key cards you want for this are Pandiety Monarchs The Monarchs Storm Forth The First Monarch The Monarchs Erupt and The First Monarch. You may also elect to run Idea the Haven Knight if you run other Monarchs.If you run want to recycle monsters you can also run a few copies of Call of the Haunted or Oasis of the Dragon Souls as well as one copy of Soul Charge to revive them.,yugioh,d08dpo2,10,t5_2rpe6

With Mathematician at  they lose some combos which really helped them Mathematician gt drop Dragonfly gt CotH Dragonfly gt pop something to summon Centipede gt overlay into something useful gt pop something with Centipede and get a Zektcaliber to recover Dragonfly is just an example but Mathematician being lvl  basically gives you one more monster on the field which is a potential  beater with Giga Mantis and Zektcaliber.I cant give you a pure list but you have the Inzektor core which Ill list below and you definitely need Upstarts CotH one or two Oasis of Dragon Souls DAD to help with Leviair combos Veilers  BLS for basically the same reason Foolish Burial and the one and only Mathematician you can run. For the Inzektor part you need  Dragonfly more if you can  Hornet even if it was at three Id run  because you dont want it in your hand with no CentipedeDragonfly  Centipede get the super ones theyre beautiful  Coccinellidae whatever is called  can be nice too but usually clogs  Hopper you dont need more you dont want less  Giga Mantis more usually clogs you dont want to draw this but search it with Centipede  Zektcaliber most people run  and while I see the advantages I just dont want to draw it on my opening hand and usually the game is over before you can use more than the first oneAnd thats it.

I only personally run  scarm because I find that despite being a good card it is rather slow and in most BAPKSR decks theres a very minimal amount of cards it can search which will disappear quickly through millingsearching. Acid golem is situationally pretty good being able to beat over kozmo ships and be turned off by fog blade in case you cant get the attack boost from gloves. In my build the BA engine is very minimal not even including Graff because of the restrictive effects of them. Hes great turn  but after that he has little utility except for bringing out cir for a farfa or scarm search.

6786746,0,t3_48ppk8,The Trishula idea wasnt a completely bullshit answer it could be done if you could pendulum the  Abductors and the Veiler out.    Have you thought about maining Kycoo? He cuts off Prime Eidos and Pantheism. Hes also decent against Kozmo. He can get beefy with double Power and he makes it so the big ships dont float.     I feel like Breaker is the ideal side card. Hes your go to out for Iron Wall Fragrance and whatever else people side against you. Hes also a Spellcaster so thats a plus.     I dont know if I like Priestess anymore. Like my first thought when I think of Priestess is aw fuck yeah fap time aw fuck yea themed dark armed!!!!!!!!! and i can play up to three!!!!!!! rank  plays too!!!!!    But the more and more I play the deck the more I hate her. I draw into her too much or I never see her when it really matters. Sure the three Justice are there to tutor her out but idk she isnt as strong anymore.   idk i love spellbook to death and i really want to make it work for this format since it doesnt seem completely out the window but the formats too fast and fate isnt as powerful as it used to be. lose  turn is pretty cool and the deck can use it very well but having to rely on one floodgate card i feel isnt good yugioh. ,yugioh,d0lkcrn,5,t5_2rpe6

6797891,0,t1_d0mpswl,Super Quantum core consists of x Super Quantum Blue Layer x Super Quantum Green Layer  x Super Quantum Red Layer x Super Quantal Fairy Alphan   Use their effects to gain advantage and put enough bodies on the field to make Mech Beasts and transform into Magnus.    Blue and Red are the more useful ones while Green is sometimes seen as the weaker link. I still run .   Alphan although RNGreliant both helps XYZ summons and helps to trigger several effects simultaneously. Not to be underestimated.  x Super Quantal Mech Ship Magnacarrier x Super Quantal Mech Sword  Magnaslayer   Carrier is not once per turn and quickly puts your XYZs on the field without having to overlay them the normal way.    Slayer is a winmore card at first glance but is necessary to combat decks that seek to grind you out. x Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse  x Super Quantal Mech Beast Aeroboros  x Super Quantal Mech Beast Magnaliger  x Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus   Selfexplanatory really.  of each for backups. Grampulse is MST Aeroboros is Book of Moon Liger is Raigeki Break while Magnus is a nontargeting Compulse Towers and uberMistake in one. Frequently used support x Emergency Teleport    Instant Blue to search? Yes please. Just make sure to do something with it before ending the turn because losing Blue can hurt massively.  x Terraforming  x Chicken Game  If your goal is Magnus Carrier is the decks lifeblood.    Since you run x Carrier you can also throw in a few Chicken Games for extra draw power. I currently run . x Volcanic Shell   Discard fodder that replaces itself not hard once per turn so one Shell gives you as many XYZ summons via Carrier as you want.  x Trick Clown  Discard fodder that supports making Rank  Aeroboros as Green is often seen as the weakest link among the Layers.  x One for One   As said earlier Alphan is a great enabler so theres no reason not to run this.  x Soul Charge  Resolving a Soul Charge will almost guarantee a Magnus with plenty of materials.  x Foolish Burial   Mainly to trigger Reds reborn effect.  Instant Fusion Elder Entity Norden Panzer Dragon   Supports Rank  and  plays pretty self explanatory. I dont use them myself though more out of a reluctance to buy than anything  Star Drawing    Also Rank  support I personally dont like it because it requires the normal summon or a CotH.  x Call of the Haunted   Pretty much a gimme in a deck that has plenty of monsters in the grave that can provide advantage when summoned.  x Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger  For overlaying on an expended Liger.  x Downerd Magician  For overlaying on an expended Grampulse I would love to list hands that  Magnus but theyre far too many and variant dependent. As for matches beware of Kaiju. Know what decks have what outs to Magnus and plan accordingly. In the mirror match or against Kaiju decks dont even bother going for Magnus as its far too risky. The Mech Beasts can play a decent control game themselves. ,yugioh,d0mtzyt,2,t5_2rpe6

Exciton is a very accessible field nuke that rewards poor play from the player that uses it and also severely punishes the opponent for making the right plays. It also only costs  material to use meaning it ends up putting severe pressure on the opponent because it can blow them up again during their Battle Phase which on first glance is how you would think to kill Exciton given its puny  Atk.

Of course its also just useful for putting damage on the board andor going for extra deck plays.

6950960,0,t3_4awf72,Going by your numbers itll be      for me. Yuya has room to grow still as well.I like Judais fun loving personality a lot and EHeroes are awesome. I also enjoyed how his character developed due to S and thought that it was true to his character. He had his issues but I felt that they were character flaws. The one thing that really wasnt was how much spotlight he had when GX actually had a pretty solid side cast for duels.Yuya is interesting because hes not some champion from the get go. He visibly improves as the series goes on and I think he really shined just right in the Maiami Championship arc. He had some nice entertaiment duels like he wants to do but he also had some brutal dark side duels. I like that he isnt just stuck on one thing or another and will adapt. Unforunately his character in the synchro arc hasnt been very good and is constantly wavering even more than he should despite finding his resolution in every ep hes not dueling during the Friendship Cup he goes and loses it again somehow offscreen.Yugi is kind of boring on his own but I appreciate how he slowly grew more into his own person by the end and Atem is cool but he gives you a feeling of knowing hell win no matter what and that kind of bores me but I also find him somewhat cool in some ways at the same time. Throw in the manga and they get more interesting as a whole.Yusei kind of annoyed me. First off in duels they literally interrupted any duel he might have lost. He always had to win and while Atem had that feel this felt like instead of it being him as the reason it was like the story couldnt let him lose no matter what happened. Hes comes off as Gary Stu and despite seeming to be stoic and serious hes a passionate guy and I dont think the way hes presented works with who he actually is. People complain plenty about Judais situational asspulls but Yusei gives him a real run for his money. Hes not an awful character but hes pretty flat.And Yuma I havent seen Zexal so hes stuck in last either way.,yugioh,d14828e,2,t5_2rpe6

Foils rares and useful commons are singled out commons are in piles of . In case of allfoil packs THSF or PGL each card is singled out.So yeah it caters more to the meta players. If you top consistently you have higher chances of getting your money back and profitting each time.A few years ago a set number of packs and pack openings were mixed top got X packs the rest were opened for th and below to pick.  tournaments in the row the opened packs contained TGU which was worth  or more and that system was abandoned.I guess the point is you get something even if youre last but youll profit only if you are in the top.,yugioh,d1efwzv,1,t5_2rpe6

7242504,0,t3_4eltnv,gt I actually thought Keith was going to die in that fire because someone told me that in the manga Keith was killed by Pegasus after he cheated so I figured Keith couldnt have too big of a role because hes dead in the manga at this point. Speaking of which how did the manga handle this if Keith was dead? If its something spoilery dont tell me.The whole warehouse duel did not happen at all.Generally the anime is a bit less cruel to side characters than the original manga who uses to kill them off once their role is over like Keith in Duelist Kingdom. Here they generally survive and most will have a second appearance at some point.From this point on it even becomes sort of a regular procedure in the anime that if a new arc begins some side characters from previous arcs will return who are either fighting the villain or have managed to end up on hisher side. You saw this with Mai in the virtual reality arc and now with Keith as henchman to the cloaked dude.

This card stops plays DEADx Cyber Dragon Core BA is a mill deck. Youre gonna he awfully salty if your Dantes mill System Downs and youre suddenly out of a side against Kozmo. You can mill Core without killing your consistency especially since Core can be used from Grave. He also only eats a normal summon unlike the actual cyber dragon. I prefer system down as a side deck card but in BA core is much much more practical. Beatrice made the Angineer plays obselete so we have  more space which is where Chimera tech goes.x Mistake I find this card incredibly useful against Monarchs and Kozmo. It stops searches in the form of Tin Can plays and TenacityPantheism. Its also a good side against Rogue decks that like to searchx Chain Disappearance this is by far my favorite trap in the game. It induces SO much salt against the meta. Think about it. Every meta deck runs cards with monsters with fewer than a  attack points.

7471363,0,t1_d2rexyc,Relax. It was an honest mistake since its ambiguous as to what and how much story content actually constitutes a spoiler. If it were me writing these reviews I wouldnt have considered it a spoiler since you could get the same information just by looking at the episode titles and nothing else. I still wouldnt have any idea about what the duel is about whos involved who wins or how they win or if theres even a victor or whats even happening with the story behind those episodes.So I try to write my posts without spoilers as I have on previous reviews but theres obviously varying levels of degrees of sensitivity about spoiler content. If someone were being hardcore about not having any spoilers then we wouldnt even be able to mention things like Battle City until theyve reached that point. I made a judgment call about whether or not the length of duels being spoilerish in which I didnt think so but now its clear that OP has a stricter sense of what constitutes a spoiler than I would and I know for next time.,yugioh,d2rg6gh,3,t5_2rpe6

7589465,0,t1_d34tgfc,  You have an awful few monsters as well as considerably low amounts of ST Hate in case of something dumb like Domain. I get youre running  Pots of Duality and  Summoners Arts but do keep in mind youre risking a lack of resources monsterwise.  Youre maindecking a LOT of Chaos Trap Hole which I suppose is understandable in this meta. Also consider cards like Chain Disappearance which can banish ScarmFarfaGraffDante and EdeaEidos. Itll also banish Tin CanSoartroopers if they dont have a big ship in hand as well as any of the nonLevel  BlueEyes monsters including both stones all the Eyes of Blue monsters and Kaibaman. Note that Chain Disappearance banishes ALL copies of that monster in the TCG itll also banish Dante from the Extra Deck for some reason.  Why in gods name are you running Number S Utopia Prime? You cant summon him in this deck. He requires  Level  LIGHT Monsters and all Qlis are Earth. Additionally his effect is relatively mediocre.  If budget isnt too big of a deal for you consider running Ghost Reaper and Winter Cherries and using your extra deck as a resource to jam up your opponents plays. Dante Beatrice PsyFramelord Omega Break Sword etc are ideal targets.Reminder that Macro Cosmos will banish your Qlis instead of them going to the Extra Deck. Itll override the Pendulum Mechanics which sucks when you already have so few Qlis in there to begin with. Additionally having ANY Qliphort in the scales locks out the Special Summoning of any NonQli something to keep in mind.TLDR  Dangerously few Monsters as resources only  form of recovery Qlimate Change. Remove  S Utopia Prime as you cant summon them. Consider removing or sidedecking Macro Cosmos itll take away resources that you cant afford to lose.EDIT My bad I thought Nova required Lv  LIGHT Machines. Removed that bit.,yugioh,d34vv9f,0,t5_2rpe6

7604096,0,t3_4jh7cs,Heroes becoming new support?,yugioh,d36joey,1,t5_2rpe6
7606203,0,t3_4jgnfa,I think an archetype should get support when it needs to. Blueeyes is a good example of this. Even if it might be too strong now if we look at the OCG where the deck is topping a lot its a very old archetype if not an archetype at all that get supported multiple times to stay more or less up to date. Problem is its generally only reserved for iconic anime cards. Chances to have new supports for minor anime archetype like Inca Gimmick Puppet nordics... andor non anime cards are very small and theses are archetypes that were already weak at their release. As for your questions I think its not a bad thing to have cards that seems to dont really fit the deck most of the time you can come up with another way to play the deck with them. Blackwing are different the problem with them is that some of their cards are stronger than the average archetype cards a lot of archetype would love to have things like Kalut pinaki or gale to name some while others are average rogue deck cards. The deck can totally run and do something with just theses useless cards but it would be very weak compared to a more common version of the deck. I think no it generally bring very linear decks. Some are still fun to play like the power ranger archetype but i cant help feeling i dont deserve the wins i can get with it because theses decks are very autopilot. I think it depends on the mechanics the archetype is supposed to play with. Combo archetypes like DDD needs a lot of cards because you need to search a lot to have different ways to do the plays the deck have to offer and you need a balance between easy to summon bosses and big bosses. The main goal should be to have enough cards to run a pure archetype deck then if you have ideas you can mix it with other things.  I named Inca Nordics and Gimmick puppet but the list is extremly long T.G. U.A buster blade Black luster soldier gagaga infernity Endymion spell counters Iron chain... and theres way way more. Some archetypes like Nordics or Inca really feel unfinished and its even worst after some years. I dont think they should stop supporting anything tbh. Even if it make me jealous that some archetype that im not interested in get a lot of love pendulum magicianperformapalOddeyes have access to all summoning methods and pendulum synchroxyz and its far to be the end of it the problem is more dont forget these than stop supporting theses,yugioh,d36salx,3,t5_2rpe6

In game three i sided some of my favourite cards i bring for fun. When he attacked my Chimeratech Fortress with his Escuridao I activated Final Fusion to end the game in a draw.

7846065,0,t1_d3xskpd,Actually the rulebook makes clear what monsters summon themselves by an effect and which do not. Special Summon Monsters that is monsters that cannot be Normal SummonedSet do not summon themselves via an effect. These monsters have their regular summon replaced by another rulethis is a summoning condition. Monsters which can be Normal SummonedSet such as Cyber Dragon have an effect that allows them to be special summoned. This effect does not have a classification. Synchro monsters etc. cannot be Normal SummonedSet and are therefore Special Summon Monsters. This is on page  of the rulebook albeit it slightly roundaboutly. Youre misunderstanding what Im saying. You need to teach game mechanics when you answer questions. Stopping the explanation at no its an inherent summon doesnt teach players game mechanics it teaches them to memorise interactions. This is bad for the player base and the game as a whole. If you insist on these kinds of answers being used youll be constantly answering the same question over and over and over again every time new cards which operate undert he same mechanics are released. For instance the sheer number of players who asked about whether or not Grand Horn of Heaven could negate a certain special summon was absolutely insane yet almost all of them would know whether or not Black Horn of Heaven could be used in the same scenario. Its the why that they didnt understand. This is what we need to instruct them on when we answer questions.,yugioh,d3xyt14,2,t5_2rpe6

7969841,0,t1_d4buj4z,Its hard to tell without actually playing but Id probably pick three things pace of game less influence of RNG and mechanic of hand.By pacing I mean that game goes straightforward too straightforward where you constantly either go  or refuse to use cards and lose your chance but thats all you can do during the turn if your field is empty. However being limited to only relying on one champion and what support you draw for it. Its hard to keep interesting pace and consistent tactic with so limited options especially that itll eventually turn into relying on going all out all time and then relying on topdeck. Fact that beating opponents champion resets your field supports this rather flat draft of game. To this mentioned reset of field and forced turn end is also rather unsettling pacing.Dice rolls that always decide effectiveness of battle give luck too much relevance that not only reduces skill height of the game but also makes it often unfair. Its not fun to either win or lose just by dice roll just at not fun its to lose because of RockPaperScissor on YuGiOh! because youre FTKd etc. This really matters since game is battlebased and by making it so dice roll for game. If you ask me only SupportCounter cards should be RNGbased leaving Champions with solid ATKDEF stats.How the hand works in the game does not appeal to me as well leaving the game to matter of mentioned luck and topdecking. I cannot say much about it from this perspective except that it might create further pacing issues along the fact that emptying slots is semiforced thing if player wants to not stop going . Since equipment slots are limited to  this makes Counters too much appealing as they can technically have limit of  this might limit creativity involved in deckmaking and create very straight metagame focused on specific counters.This also creates situation of I draw card. I use it imminently. I draw another I use it right now. Theres not much tactic involved and if player wants to assemble stronger combo by not playing any cards right now theyre punished. Though this all depends on how the game will look and of course  cards on field is rather something that matters but I could still complain.Thats what if talk from perspective of guy whos used to YuGiOh! and Pokemon TCGs. I dont have experience in making TCGs nor have played your game obviously. Dont treat my opinion as something rocksolid but if its up to make game look better from perspective that I am on. Id probably say something different after playing the game.But thing that differs Chibi Champions from YuGiOh! and Pokemon TCG is that in the YGO and PTCG there are always options to do even if youre at disadvantage you can rely on many options of what you can do along stream of the duels turns depending how you decided to play and in both youre never closed to have more options because youre having too much cards on field. No matter how these games resolve specific situation theyre NEVER repetitive and each duel is unique because theres many options to do in each duel without being forced to use them at the moment relying only on players judgement. This is what makes good TCGs so exciting.Its not like the game is allbad though. I like some ideas it haves like monsters that only come from Extra Decks although its possibly factor that brings repetitive gameplay or Status Conditions. I also like the overall mechanics of counters equips and Champions effects. This might be good game but as I said for now biggest issue is luckplay.,yugioh,d4bvw64,1,t5_2rpe6

7972367,0,t3_4of1su,If those are an issue for you then your deck must be too focused on using up multiple cards to summon  good card. Thats a bad strategy since youre wasting multiple cards for something which can be gotten rid of with just  card from your opponent. If youre playing a Monster which makes you lose multiple cards to get it out then that Monster needs to do more than just sit there with high ATK. Maybe it could have an effect which lets you summon other monsters like RedEyes Darkness Metal Dragon. Or it could have an effect which protects itself from being targeteddestroyed by card effects like AzureEyes Silver Dragon. Or it could have an effect which summons a monster when its destroyed like Beatrice The Eternal Lady. Or it could have an effect which destroys your opponents cards like Assault Blackwing  Raikiri the Rain Shower.Or it could do all of the above because somehow thats fair like Kozmo Dark Destroyer.,yugioh,d4c63wo,1,t5_2rpe6

8300022,0,t1_d5eepc9,currrently on ygopro the trap card hasnt been working correctly. But by bouncing around the effects of multiple copies of both Athena and Darklord Superbia you can special summon one of the two monsters with this as an effect as your last special summon with their effects. this step works best if its started with a special summon because itll allow you to tribute summon laterDuring either players turn You can pay  LP then target  Darklord SpellTrap Card in your Graveyard this effect becomes that targets effect when that card is activated then shuffle that target into the Deck.Then use that effect on the spell card to search for Darklord Lucifer that you can tribute summon now and he can special summon Darklord Zerato with his effect.You use zeratos effect to destroy all their monsters and you now have multiple strong monsters to attack directly. And they should have taken good damage from the athenas before the direct attack anyway.,yugioh,d5f26z6,2,t5_2rpe6

I cant really hold the loss to Andore against Aki considering she did actually do better against him than Jack. Jack barely scratched him whereas  Aki at least chipped off most of his life points and got Stardust ready for Yusei. Honestly Andore shouldve been a signer he kicks their collective asses.The odd thing about Rua is that they clearly planned for him to get Life Stream all along  after all you can see Life Stream with the other signer dragons from early on and then when he duels Lucciano early in season  he mysteriously hears a heartbeat when he gets in trouble  obviously foreshadowing his heart birthmark.

Of course he cares about him he even lost his duel against Camula to save Shou but I have the impression he treats Judai way better than Shou. I always thought there would be some explanation about this some regrets from the past but nothing in this sense is shown until the end so I guess its only his way of being.gtTeamPhoenix there I finally said it lolYeah TeamPhoenix all the way through!

8396796,0,t1_d5r0zqp,gt Ok man if youre gonna use Strawman arguement a like the hippo arguement theres no reason to try and have an intelligent debate with you. HOWEVERInsults are the best way to win an ARGUMENT s.  Especially when you cant spell the word ARGUMENT correctly with spell check built into your browser or utilize the rules of English grammar whilst simultaneously implying that you are more intelligent than me.  As for your use of the phrase Straw Man ARGUMENT you are using is incorrect. Its actual definition is a fallacy that is committed when a person simply ignores a persons actual position and substitutes a distorted exaggerated or misrepresented version of that position. This sort of reasoning has the following pattern Person A has position X. Your quote wasgtAnd with Phantom Knights around they barely even make Beatrice. Ive only seen it made against me twice. They usually will go for Break Sword and try and gain advantage that wayMy response wasgtJust because you havent seen it happen it doesnt mean its true. I havent seen a Hippo in real life but it doesnt mean it doesnt exist.Your position was Beatrice has only been summoned on me twice and they used Break Sword way more.My counter point was just because it hasnt happened to you does not make it true for everyone else.  The Hippo analogy helps illustrate this point.  At no point did I misrepresent your stance.gt Dante mills ON YOUR TURN when you want it. Not at the end of the turn once everything is useless. Comparing BA to lightsworns is just ignorant. Lightsworns have  power plays except JD and have an into rely different playstyle altogether. They simply both mill.Raiden mills during your main phase and the entire Lightsworn archetype only mill ON YOUR TURN.  Just not during your main phase.  Minerva Turbo is a quite relevant deck Expensive as fuck and does the same thing BAs Do but with Minervas and Rank s and Level  Synchros which are far superior to any Rank  BA can produce.  Lightsworns are built to mill cards and get grave effects BA are built to mill cards and get grave effects.  The only difference between them is that on is light and has a bunch of different levels the other has  level.gt Dante is nowhere near as SPLASHABLE as Ptolemaeus was. Ptolemaeus could only really summon Ntss Infinity and Plaides. Again Strawman. Your grass and the trash people throw in it is entirely irrelevant stop making false analogies to try and defend unsound logic.I get it Im the illogical one clearly Ptolemaeus can summon a fusion monster.  I think you mean Azzathoth and he could summon any Rank  thats its effect.   Lets use our lovely definition from earlier and apply it to the quotes again since you are once again claiming a Straw Man ARGUMENT was used.Your statementgtBeatrice is a more powerful card but since Dante is needed usually to summon her so hitting Dante hits her. Like Ptolemaeus and Infinity.My Counter PointgtDante is no where near as good as Ptolemaeus was. And thats the same logic as saying that I need to burn all my grass because someone through trash on it once. We need to deal with the actual problem first. So your argument was hitting Dante is akin to hitting Ptolemeaus because they both summon broken cards in Beatrice and Infinity respectively.My argument was Ptolemaeus was not banned just for being able to make Infinity he was banned for being able to summon any Rank .  However Dante can only summon one problem card in Beatrice so the grass analogy was used to illustrate this point.  Again no Straw Man ARGUMENT here.gt You Kaiju anything you dont want on the field and make it something you can do damage to. If Dante is in DEF mode and I have a thunder king in my hand in gonna give you a turtle and give myself a  beat stick and an outlet to smack with Crystal wing. I used Kaiju as an example of the most indodge able removal and Dante STILL goes off. And no making a second Dante is incredibly easy with many different mills. If you kill a Cir or Graff sure but if you mill PK trap cards or ancient cloak or fiendish rhino warrior you can still make Dante easily also since BA can spam from hand so milling pretty much anything will doC its smart deck building at that point.A deck of  level three monsters where half of them special themselves or have some interaction with traps that allow them to be special summoned from grave will be able to make rank s easily.  Kaijuing a Dante is a bad play regardless of what you do unless you Dweller first.  Thats on you as a player to recognize and understand.  That has nothing to do with the card itself you know it has a grave effect play around it.  gt Im done arguing with you if youre not going to make intelligent retorts like comparing LS to BA... Really?Its really hard to take your comments seriously when this is the first statement you made without a major grammatical or spelling error.  Especially since this is a comment that once again mocks my own intelligence.  My suggestion to you is in the future when you are trying to insult someones intelligence please take some time to make sure everything is spelt correctly and makes sense before posting it on a public forum.  Enjoy your baked potato.    ,yugioh,d5r5aa2,-2,t5_2rpe6

Similar to majespecters but remove their protection Im exchange for decent stats and more consistency. Their theme could be something based on pretty anime boys aka traps. They could have an xyz boss monster who is able to reset your used traps and prevents set backrow from being popped.Basically an archetype with searchable themed bottomless compulse torrential etc. Designed so it isnt a stun deck but make it focus more on oneforone removal than floodgates like lots of modern control decks do. Also no counter traps. Basically do everything possible to make the deck powerful but fairEdit all monster gave the effect if this card is summonedsent to the graveyarddestroyedwhatever add one archetype name trap card from your deck to your hand. Then the traps have some condition while you control an archetype name monster. Or while an archetype name monster is in the graveyard you can activate this cardMonster example archetype Thomas level   if this card is normal or special summoned add one archetype trap from your deck to your hand.Trap example archetype hole trap. When your opponent summons a monster with  or more attack banish it. You must control a face to archetype monster to activate and resolve this effect,yugioh,d6710ka,3,t5_2rpe6

I ran the field spell but thats up to you. Run at least  Crystal Release. It can speeds up the deck when it leaves the field and goes well with Tiger. Also make sure to run Lightning Chidori and Number  Heartlandraco. They both work really well in the deck.

Leo Dancer can clear fields but Panther Dancer can otk floaty decks or leave your opponents with less monsters and no float. The deck absolutely needs  Tenki and Double Allure. It speeds it up a ton. Once Crimson Fox comes out a semi decent Rank  engine comes into play and with it you can run Tiger King a lot easier who can get pretty buff pretty fast. It is kind of fucked to get him and Leo Dancer on board. Only problems I find the deck has is it is very fragile. Not getting out a Panther Dancer with some protection or means to make another one leaves you very wide open.

8667085,0,t1_d6ow5xk,Writing this on mobile will add extra details tomorrow on desktop.But basically Battlin Boxers are neverdying Graveyardtofield Xyz Spam. Theres a few variants to this but thats kinda the general principal behind them all.So to start the main deck monsters.BB Headgeared again mobile so Im just gonna abbreviate for now is a Level  FIRE Warrior with  ATK. Once per turn its not destroyed by battle in Attack Position and when its Normal Summoned you can send  BB monster from your deck to the Graveyard.BB Glassjaw has  ATK and is also a Level  FIRE Warrior. When its attacked it automatically destroys itself and when its sent to the Graveyard by ANY card effect not just its own it adds a BB monster that isnt Glassjaw from the Grave to your hand.Headgeared and Glassjaw appear in about  or more of my BB plays. Theyre both really good together or seperate and are kinda the backbone of the whole deck.An example play is if you have Reinforcement of the Army or Foolish Burial in hand. Add Headgeared to your hand with ROTA and send another BB monster preferably Sparrer since he Special Summons if theres a BB on the field to the Graveyard. Next Normal Summon Headgeared send Glassjaw to Grave. Add the other BB to your hand and voila! Instant combo.Alternatively you can use Glassjaw to add BB Xyz Monsters or other BB monsters I havent mentioned to the Extra Deck or hand respectively. For exampleBB Counterpunch you mentioned this one already right? Banish from hand or Grave add  ATK to a BB on the field. Its good in a pinch whether to get around Vanitys EmptinessMacro Cosmos or just to whoop an annoying OddEyesMonarch in sheer strength. I only run him at  since hes easy to search and doesnt do Rnk plays but hes pretty good for what hes worth.BB Sparrer If you control a BB you can Special Summon him from the hand. Theres a catch though You cant attack for the rest of the turn. Either use him the first turn of the duel I have actually done that before or summon him after the Battle Phase. Good card though and has decently high ATK combined with Counterpunch hes pretty good.BB Veil is possibly the Decks only builtin  defensive play. A Level  FIRE Warrior like the rest he only has  ATK but that doesnt matter. You can Special Summon him to recover LP if you lose Life Points during a battle. At  DEF hes not exactly an Impenetrable Wall but he does the job and saves you in a pinch. BB Switchitter Dont remember if its one h or two is the alternative to Headgeared. At  ATK hes again a decent fighter for Xyz fuel and when hes Normal Summoned you can Special Summon ANY and I mean ANY BB monster from your Graveyard to the field at the small cost of only summoning BB monsters for the rest of the turn.With Switchitter you can summon Glassjaw Headgeared or any of the others for Rnk BB in fact you can even summon BB Xyz from your Grave then either attack if its Star Caestus use its effect if its Nova Kaiser or summon F if the Xyz is Lead Yoke.Yup you heard me. Utopic Future Number F the Utopia of choice for PK Fires everywhere. BB can use it too! And let me tell you it is FUUUUUUUUUUUUUN. Just take two usedup Lead Yoke or Blade Armor Ninja and let the slaughter begin. Good Times.The last BB maindeck monster for Rnk anyways will cover the more gimmicky Rnk tomorrow is Shadow.  ATK and can Special Summon itself from the hand by detaching an Xyz Material from a BB Xyz monster. While not one Id run  of unless you have an Xyz or Counterpunch in play its can be a bit of a brick it again is still good when you need it.  or less of him no matter what BB deck youre running.Theres I think only three BB SpellsTraps in existence. One Trap is super gimmicky in my opinion and Ive never found a use for it believe its Last Counter  but the other  are Deadly with a capital D.Battlin Boxing Spirits a Normal Spell. You send the top card of your Deck to the Grave then SS  BB monster from your Grave. A really good pinch card helps to keep the deck running and sometimes you mill Glassjaw with it thats always the best. Jolt Counter is a Counter Trap that lets you negate an effect during the Battle Phase. Really good for Kozmos and BB mirror matches I cant tell you how many times Ive wanted to punch the DevPro AI for using it. Ive always meant to get  of it but I kinda forgot and never bought them. The deck still runs fine without it though just replace it with Effect Veiler and Dark Bribe and whatnot.Ill cover the Xyz Rnk stuff and outside support tomorrow but that should be enough to start the deck at least. Feel free to fill my inbox with questions too.EDIT Almost forgot you mentioned Igknight Boxers right? That could probably work though Ive never tried it myself.

However if this next banlist is a format reset which I doubt it will be anyway hand traps will be overall weaker because all the good decks that are susceptible to hand traps right now will be overall weaker thus making maining hand traps to be less desirable since the best decks at that time would be playing monsters that are less susceptible to the aforementioned cards.,yugioh,d6ruuo4,-1,t5_2rpe6

I presume what youre thinking of is the fact that some cards have effects that activate when theyre sent to the graveyard rather than sent from the field to the graveyard. Those will work since they only need to be sent to the grave which detaching them does do.Now you can argue that its a silly rule that Xyz Materials arent considered to be on the field.

8744086,0,t3_4ztn3s,Find some videos of gameplay from the time. Youll see pretty quickly! Also remember that Dracossack was a much better card than it is now. This was a time before Castel or Silent Honor Ark came out. It was like a Kozmo Dark Destroyer in terms of how tough it was to get rid of. Also its effect to destroy a card on the field was more powerful than it is now. Now weve got loads of monsters which have strong effects when theyre destroyed. That wasnt the case back then. And Dragon Rulers could get out Dracossack much easier than Kozmo can get out Dark Destroyer. ,yugioh,d6ynwrz,8,t5_2rpe6

Of course using his dark powers was part of the charachter but still he didnt display any sort of increadible dueling skills. Hell he even got last in the way duel.  Bakura was the only person he won cleanly.Also his deck was really underwhelming.

Both Dark Destroyer and Kirin are now limited. The only other notable untargetable now is Chaos MAX and BEWD builds centered around it are generally inferior to more standard builds.

The main issue is that its difficult to summon DM without Navigation or Eternal Soul one of which is pricey and the other might also be pricey we just dont know yet.  So Pendulums work in tandem to help summon out DM from hand as well as making it easy to make Ebon Illusion Magician who can get DM out of the deck.  Overall I strongly believe that if your friend can get over the initial learning curve for Pendulums they serve as a fantastic budget avenue for being able to have a cool DM deck.,yugioh,d798w8h,2,t5_2rpe6

8847902,0,t3_51c69o,Typically any meta deck. I have enjoyed a very small amount of meta decks in the past but I find most boring and shameful. I really dont understand how guys just follow the meta and play the best things every time something new pops up. Most of the time meta decks are so good and so far above  of the competition that it turns the game from a fun strategythinking card game to a boring shameful win simulator.Oh yay I won with Monarchs go me! ...

8866011,0,t1_d7dk2dk,gt it is essentially already paid so giving something Hexproof doesnt prevent the Effect from resolving properly. This made sense to me until I learned that book of moon negates cards that target face up monsters. I thought you had to choose a target on activation in YGO just like Magic and it has to be a valid target on resolution just like Magic. The only difference is that untargetable does not stop something being a valid target on resolution only if it stops being faceupetc.Magic hexproof is similar you cant target something that is hexproof. The difference is that if you give something hexproof in response to a targeted ability it will fizzle on resolution. In Yugioh it seems that is not the case. Magic has similar effects to get around hexproof Councils Judgement has a choosevote system to avoid targeting and any edict style effects target player sacrifices a creature targets the player not their hexproof creatures. The only inconsistency Im seeing is that Book of Moon negates things that target faceup monsters but Safe Zone doesnt negate things that target monsters. That just seems odd to me because both would in Magic terms cause the original ability CL to fizzle on resolution due to its target no longer being valid.,yugioh,d7dkj8c,1,t5_2rpe6

Apparently we werent alone in thinking it was a stupid unintuitive and ultimately broken rule cause the OCT and TCG eventually did away with it too.Then again I only ever played in local tourneys never anything big MAYBE  players on a huge day and I completely stopped playing YuGiOh tourneys once the AdvancedTraditional split occurred so thats probably why Id never heard of it before that person told me.,yugioh,d86fvd5,0,t5_2rpe6

9134585,0,t3_55arkg,Personally I think either Maxx C or Ghost Ogre. Both are extremely powerful this format. Maxx c has always been good and right now almost every high caliber deck is going to give the opponent  cards off of the c or leave themselves in otk reach. Ghost ogres ability to hit monster and spelltrap is very good right now as well. Can be used to deal with most monsters from the extra deck and can also hit those precious scales that are most needed by Metalfoes it can also hit the upcoming DDD cards like dark contract as well as stop a huge atk from abyssmegalo can hit omega even.

9151053,0,t3_55iko7,Alright lets get cracking on a deck for the KINGU!!!Anyways RDA Decks can go one of two ways you either use a DARK Engine using Destiny HERO  Malicious and Armageddon KnightDark Grepher etc... or you go the full Red route. I have played with both so I can give some tips regarding both. Ive noticed that you seem to be using a mix of both which I actually dont really approve of as it makes the deck a bit unstable.So for now I will explain how the  builds are best played and then you can see which one you would like to play the most I also see that you want TCG so I wont include any OCG cards for now.So the Red Build otherwise known as ARCV Atlas.dek pThe plays of this deck include using Red Sprinter or Red Resonators effect to easily get the other one on the field and Synchro into Red Wyvern after which you use either Synkron Resonator Plaguespreader Zombie and other Tuners to climb the Synchro Ladder and go into Abyss Bane and CalamityI like the Red build as it uses a handtrap in Red Gardna and Red Mirror to aid your Red Dragon Archfiends stay on the field to continue climbing the ladder. The effect of Red Resonator can also help you gain some more life in case you need some extra time to get your Dragons on the fieldNext the DARK build also known as Malicious Spam  UltimayaThis build uses the high level of Destiny HERO  Malicious to easily go to Level  Synchros like Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend. It also uses Armageddon Knight and Dark Grepher to quickly get Malicious and Plaguespreader Zombie in your grave to SS them from the graveyard. This allows you to quickly get Level  monsters on the field to Synchro or to make  very good Rank  monsters for this deck Number  and Beatrice Lady of the Eternal. Beatrice allows you to dump a Plaguespreader or GlowUp Bulb to synchro later on but also can put a Return of the Dragon Lords in the graveyard to protect the Dragons that are already on the field.This deck also makes good use of ETele and Risebell the Star Adjuster. Even if ETele is only at  now you can still easily go to level  and beyond. One example is using Red Resonators effect to SS Risebell from your hand and increasing its level to  that way for a quick Scarlight.It also makes use of Synkron Resonator to go to Abyss and Bane quickly recycle the Red Resonator in your graveyard and then using Banes effect to bring back Tuners and go to Calamity for big damage. You can also combo Bane with Malicious by SSing a Malicious and Tributing it with Banes effect to bring back a Scarlight or Abyss you used to synchro Bane in the first place.It can also make good use of Ultimaya since you can synchro Red Resonator with Dark Grepher or Armageddon Knight to bring out Coral Dragon SS Malicious and go into Ultimaya to then bring out Crystal Wing very quickly.As you can probably tell I prefer the DARK build since in my personal experience it is both more consistent and more powerful but I do also have experience in using the Red build which is still very fun to play and does feel a bit more Atlasy if that makes sense.Anyway feel free to think it over what build you would prefer and then Ill do my best to help you with that build. I say this because a mix of the  tends to brick a lot and is less powerful than either of the  builds in my experience.,yugioh,d8bynm3,3,t5_2rpe6

A common problem I run into with this deck is having  cards in my hand after doing the Tzolkin combo which means that I dont have any extra plays after my first turn. Bubbleman works as my extra play since he can be used to summon Rnk monsters and hes easily searchable via Shadowmist which I can dump via Beatrice.

Cu Chulainn Beatdown the deck yeah its probably not going to be anywhere as good as something newer but cards like PrePreparation of Rites have allowed decks like these to be at least PLAYABLE.I would perhaps try to build the deck as if it was a BlueEyes White Dragon deck because BlueEyes a Normal Monster has good base ATK for Cu Chulainn to base her attack off of. So with that maybe a good draw engine would consist of x BlueEyes  Dragon Spirit of White  Tradein and some number of the White Stone of Ancients  Cards of Consonance any BlueEyes duelists help me out here.

Almost none of the cards synergise so any hand with a combination of RDA and SPYRAL is almost certain to brick. But I see that Machine Dup tech and I like.EDIT    After playing the deck a bit against AI I can make a couple comments and suggestions. You need to fill the holes in the synchro ladder. Im talking about Lv and lv synchro monsters. RDAs and Resonators are all about climbing the synchro ladder to get to stronger and stronger Synchros. A good lv synchro to add would be Clear Wing Synchro Dragon or Black Rose Moonlight Dragon. After using Red Resonator and Machine Dupe to bring out  Quick Fixes you have the opportunity to make a lv Synchro and also load the grave with all those Quick Fixes. Armades Catastor and Hyper Librarian are all good choices. Once you have a synchro monster on the field you can SS Synkron Resonator and start the climb.,yugioh,d8s4blw,6,t5_2rpe6

ABC is the actual good card in the deck hangar is decent. the monsters are pretty trash except for B.What actually makes ABC strong is the ability to have ABC Dragon Buster out AS WELL AS backrow. You do max out on the monsters when running desires to offset the cost. If youre not running desires the rd AC arent really helping you as much as theyre hurting you.

9351566,0,t1_d91d9fy,Then at this point I question whats the point? What does this pointless split for formats do for the game? You propose a solution without thinking through the implications fully. Like think if this rotation does happenExpanded format would literally be what we have now and nothing would change.Standard format on the other hand would be a complete mess in all aspects. It would further increase power creep in this small format as more powerful cards would absolutely be needed to compete due to the smaller and ever changing card pool. Its not like suddenly when konami introduces this format they are going to stop intoducing more powerful cards because it would make it so no Expanded player What I assume would be the most popular format would want to buy the set. Even in the dream scenario where having a rotation reduces power creep Only in standard format obviously you still are looking at much higher spendings over the course of the format existing. Its not like now where you can buy a deck that is unlikely going to get hit by the banlist and just play that casually for as long as you wish. For standard youd need to constantly be purchasing product to keep up with the much smaller card pool.Not to mention that even if the power level dropped drastically in this dream world it still just lead to power creep but starting back from the beginning. Its a terrible idea that very few players want and could led to the actual death of the game if not handled right by konami. Its not a good idea.,yugioh,d91dn1q,5,t5_2rpe6

9360095,0,t3_58j20j,I teach younger kids at locals. Cuz people taught me when I was young so I return the favor.I start by teaching them the absolute basics. Monsters spells traps each type etc. etc. How to normal summon conditions for a special summon and spell speed. The most important lesson in the beginning is the phase breakdown. The battle phase is a very long lesson sometimes. Depending on the person. Standby Phase can be a little difficult to explain to some too. Another thing to teach is card advantage and cost vs effect kids run anything that says Discard in DW decks. Also explaining popular cards well Like Solemn Strike and Warning helps them a ton.Then I have five decks I have fully built made to teach one mechanic. I never use these other than to teach. I use Blackwings for Synchro Gadgets for Xyz Lunalights for Fusion OddEyes Magicians for Pendulums and a Cyber Angel deck for Ritual.I have them pick the one they are most interested in first and then have them use that deck and play against me using another deck focused on the same summoning condition. Ill use my Zombie Synchro purposely not hand looping vs Blackwings for example or Evilswarms vs Gadgets.Once they understand or master summoning mechanic we move on to the next. A lot of the time new players grasp Xyz and Ritual a lot faster than Fusion Pendulum and Synchro. I meet a lot of new players already knowing how to do a summonig type already from watching the show. Usually Fusion.The most important part of teaching is patience. You will get frustrated sometimes with new players as they might take a while to learn but it pays off.Also Ill provide the decklist to the decks I use to help people learn. They are very budget for the most part and can be made better for them to teach them more.Edit Im on mobile only so i used YGOpro to take screenshots of the decks off the top of my head.BlackwingsGadgetsOddEyes MagiciansLunalightsCyber Angels,yugioh,d92gk2g,3,t5_2rpe6
9362340,0,t3_57x72d,Question about effect negation. The scenario is as follows My opponent plays Buster Blader the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman and I have Number  Lancelot Dark Knight of the Underworld on the field. If I were to not use my effect of number  to negate the fusion summon and were to instead use my effect on the fusion monster itself what would happen to that monster? Would the Buster Blader not get the  point bonuses and stay at its original strength for the turn? Would they then get it their buffs the next turn? What would happen in a situation like that with a monster like the fusion Buster Blader? Simply put would I not allow the fusion monster to get its buffs and if so when if at all would he get to have them?,yugioh,d92qsl0,2,t5_2rpe6

9372285,0,t1_d93g0i7,The cards existed in Japan since September  . If they wanted to change its name over there they likely would have.This isnt a question of what they can or cant do because no one here has any knowledge of what their limits are.Its a question of does making a nonHarpie card into a Harpie card benefit the franchiseand to be frank it doesnt particularly because  Harpie as a grouping doesnt matter to the franchise beyond helping to leverage legacy support in upcoming releases in leveraging that legacy support no one ever had a good reason to give a damn about Rescue Rabbit given that nonEffect Monsters have never been a good part of the Harpie grouping regardless of whether or not were talking about manga source material or subsequent product release.Meanwhile the idea of making all the cards work the same way worldwide as often as possible DOES serve the franchises interests. So does making card text shorter.Making it Sky Scout makes card texts that involve the Harpie grouping shorter since they dont need to worry about exceptions now. This is important in the event they ever want to make a Harpie grouping card whose text pushes the upper boundaries of what fits in a text box check out Beatrice for an example of what happens when you begin to run out of space and check out Ras first OCG print for an example of what happens when you completely run out.Making it Sky Scout on the official database also ensures players can at least try to avoid having the Harpie stuff work with it because if it doesnt work with it in one territory it shouldnt in any territory.,yugioh,d94059b,3,t5_2rpe6

9382885,0,t3_4kudd1,Gamecial. If they expect it they have to special all the parts and from there you need to OTK or at least clear their board and set up your own. Gamecial should probably be main decked but mandatory to at least side them. Although if they have Cyber Dragon Infinity Id Gamecial that. Iron Wall and Chaos Hunter are relevant side deck cards prevent him from coming out and using his removal effect. D.D. Crow can at least remove a single piece and you should have Crow for BlueEyes matchup anyways. If you have Extra Deck space running Cherries with cards like ABC Dragon Buster and Dante is a good idea. Ghost Ogre stops ABC Buster if they banish on their turn but isnt very good in the matchup.System Down can singlehandedly win the game but youll need another removal to get Cydra out of the way and AntiSpell Fragrance is popular. Setting it for next turn is asking for Twin Twisters and you probably wont survive the next turn.If you are playing a backrow heavy deck you can throw in Compulse or BoM and activate on their turn. BoM is underrated right now but it forces Floodgate monsters to deal with it deals with Buster on their turn and the other things that BoM does. BoM is probably the most versatile backrow in the game so it could even be mained although it may not be very strong in some matchups.,yugioh,d95chwr,1,t5_2rpe6

Not many Lightsworn decks that top actually run three Omegas most focus around Fairy Tail  Snow and flooding the field with Rank  monsters. Usually the ones that top run .  If an opponent has the hand to get out three Omegas and dump Rise to Full Height in the first turn even without three Omegas you likely would have lost regardless.  One Omega with Rise to Full Height is more than enough to pull off the loop.

Book of eclipsegt special thrashergt normal assault core equip with buster drakegt make utopiamake utopia Primegt Thomas discards Cloak and summons chaos huntergt Run Chaos hunter over with primegtThomas gt Prime effect in MP destroy and banish  monsters Niccolo  lp Thomas gt make two abc dragon bustersgt end turngt game is over because of time final LP Thomas  Niccolo  LP.So this is just a case of two misplays equalling out in the end of the day Thomas Rose should have kept his third chaos hunter in hand just in case there was a top decked board wipedark holeRaigeki and almost lost because of that misplay.

9650165,0,t3_5d77zn,I simply dont like Dracoslayers at all.     They are just not good scales and Rose Warrior of Revenge is simply a far better Tuner than Luster. You can simply add and recover it searching from the Deck or Graveyard whenever you need her. And she is also a level  WarriorType to contribute with Rhongomyniad plays.     Now that we have Igknight Unite Igknight Champion is better than Ignister because its much more easier to put on field over and over again.     I highly recommend you to play x Ignition Phoenix alongside x Terraforming. You will need just x Reload and x Igknight Unite at least. Reload is bad at  because its OPT clause and you can simply search it by Phoenix if you need to. Phoenix also search Unite for you. And less important give your monsters an ATK boost.  For the Synchros I suggest Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend. Just put a lot of monsters on field with good attack one of them being a level  and Synchro Summon Scarlight with the searched Tuner Rose. Blow everything up since Scarlight destroys only effect monsters your Igknights will stay on field and swing for game.     Other play you could make is      Pendulum Summoning x Level s and x Level s   Pop scales for Rose   Normal Summon Rose   Put a high ATK monster on Scale   Synchro Summon OddEyes Meteorburst Dragon   Special Summon the Scale   Xyz Summon Beyond    Put the ATK of everything to    Synchro Summon Nirvana High Paladin   Add something from Grave to your hand an used RotASummoners Art or even some other Igknight monster   Attack with Nirvana some monster you just d the ATK dealing  Battle Damage   Use Nirvanas effect to half your opponents LP    Attack with Utopia Beyond dealing more  Battle Damage.    This combo can just win you the game if performed with your opponents LP at .  LP   LP. Cut it by half and it stays at  LP. And you still have your Beyond with  ATK to swing for game.     Another stall plays are using Cxyz Barian Hope on top of Number C Silent Honor DARK to keep copying Rhongomyniads effect from Grave over and over again. You can make it turn  by simply Pendulum Summoning x Level s and x Level s. Just make Rhongomyniad using the Level s. Pop scales for another Level . Tribute Rhongomyniad to Tribute Summon the Level  you searched. Xyz Summon C using all  Level s. Summon Cxyz Barian Hope over C. Use Barian Hopes effect to copy the effect from Rhongomyniad on Grave. Now you have a  ATK beast with a material Rhongomyniad effect. Since you choose the order your effects resolves during your opponents End Phase choose to Barian to loose Rhongomyniad effect before the forced detaching material. Suddenly you have to just copy the effect from Rhongomyniad again next turn and keep the lock of material Rhongomyniad on field over and over again.     Theres a ton of other plays this deck can make. Its main challenge is dealing with disruption. But its one of my favorite decks to play.

9698109,0,t1_da8g7dt,funnily enough i cut flare metal last minute for breaksword as i decided that the situations where flare metal comes up were far too niche. My reasoning behind not running dante is that generally the only time you would be wanting to go into it is when you have drawn terrortop and bricked and your just praying that one of the top  cards of your deck is a trap or banishment. Using this information i came to the conclusion to not run dante as it is very rare for you to brick draw terrortop and have one of the aforementioned cards in the top  of your deck so i decided to cut it for totem bird. Moving forward either option is viable over the heliopolis which imo was underwhelming,yugioh,da8hycu,3,t5_2rpe6

9810495,0,t1_dam7fhq,My suggested rewording for Zefrasabers effectgtDuring your Main Phase You can destroy this card and if you do Tribute monsters from your hand or field then Ritual Summon  Nekroz Ritual Monster from your hand or  of your banished Nekroz Ritual Monsters whose Level exactly equals the total Levels of those monsters.The Yang Zing monsters effects wont cause timing issues since they say and if you do instead of then or after that.As far as usefulness take all of this with a grain of salt since I havent had too much experience with any of these Decks and no experience whatsoever with pure ZefraId definitely run Zefraxi and Zefraniu. Making immediate Synchro plays and being able to search Nine Pillars is great.I doubt Id use Zefraxas Pendulum Effect. Clausolas does pretty much the same thing but it doesnt make you discard another monster and it lets you put the Ritual Spell in your Graveyard so you can use its effect. Its monster effect doesnt seem particularly useful either its still Level  so you need to activate  cards in your Pendulum Zones then Pendulum Summon Zefraxa. Once thats done you only have  or  cards left in your hand. If you want to get any mileage out of Zefraxas effect youd then need to have a Ritual Spell Card and a monster to Ritual Summon. This means youd probably need to make Zefraxas Level exactly equal the Level of that Ritual Monster which in turn means you cant Ritual Summon anything bigger than Brionac!Zefrasabers Pendulum Effect seems like it can only be used for a longer game which isnt going to be the case if youre playing Nekroz. And Nekroz Ritual Spells in the Graveyard can already add more Ritual Spells to your hand so I dont see the point of its monster effect.Im not sure how good the tellarknights are.Shaddolls usually want to flip their monsters faceup on command rather than facedown so I dont think Zefracores monster effect would be that good. Its Pendulum Effect might be good but having to essentially give up a card to use it might not be worth it.Zefranaga is worth running for its Pendulum Effect alone since it gives the Deck a way of Fusion Summoning that can be searched with Hedgehogs Graveyard effect.The only card Zeframpilicas Pendulum Effect synergizes with is Apelio so it doesnt look that good. Not sure about the monster effect on the one hand if you use it for a Fusion  of the  monsters has to have been Special Summoned so you cant use UltiCannahawks effect. On the other hand it can recycle a destroyed UltiCannahawk.If youre returning banished cards to your Graveyard then youve already got the UltiCannahawk loop working so you dont really need Zeframpengus effect. As far as the monster effect theres probably not much in the Extra Deck you want to add to your hand and the only banished monsters youd want to target would be Fusion Monsters. Though I suppose that at the very least the two Pendulums could still act as extra names.Paths first effect is pretty situational and its second effect is barely harmful.Chosen of Zefra might be good but it is still pretty slow since its a Trap.Divine Strike looks good.As an aside Im not sure why youre singling out Shaddolls as unplayable considering tellarknights Nekroz and Ritual Beasts are hardly playable.,yugioh,damcqn9,2,t5_2rpe6

9862975,0,t1_dat2xdy,You can actually make a field similar to this rather consitently but it requires at least  Dante to go off and a really good mill off of your Dante. Ive managed to get the above field with a Scarm search for Tour Guide on End Phase.Basically for this to work you need to mill pretty well or have the proper materials Graff Cir Fiendish Rhino Warrior in hand. Your way too it will vary but here is roughly the order of steps sorry I cant be more helpful.. Make Dante with your BA materials and mill hopefully youve milled at least Fiendish Rhino Warrior which should get you rolling.. Use Fiendish Rhino to send Graff to grave to summon Cir from deck and hopefully you have another Malebranche in hand to summon to make Leviair. Make it but dont use its effect yet. . If in your handgraveyard you have OnuncuDevyaty and Dekatron...plus at least two more Infernoids. Go and summon out  of the two OnuncuDevyaty using the Dekatron as a material for the summon.. Then use Leviairs effect to summon back Dekatron activate Dekatrons effect to send an OnuncuDevyaty from deck I run two of each. Which one you choose also depends on what deck youre facing. Two Onuncu negates vs Pendulum is pretty good.. This step depends on whether you have one more BA in hand hopefully Scarm which you can then use to turn the Dante that is there in Beatrice and boom youve got a killer board. If that is Scarm then congrats you can make Dante next turn.This board requires a lot of luck to make and proper management of resources but is pretty damn killer if you can do it.,yugioh,dat62l2,2,t5_2rpe6

9882585,0,t3_5gttdm,Just thought of another one while I was browsing around on the web!I dont know how many people here know about this game but back in  Seirra released a game called Shivers.  The story in a nutshell was that your shitty friends dared you to stay the night at Professor Windlenots Museum of the Strange and Unusual which had been closed for years due to reports of two teens going missing there as well as the professor himself.  What neither you or they knew at the time however was what caused the disappearances  mysterious entities known as the Ixupi.  Heres a link to the Shivers wiki if you wanna read about their origins But basically in a nutshell theyre malevolent entities that steal the life force out of things that they attack slowly whittling them down to a dried up corpse.  This could be translated into YuGiOh as a Burn style of deck.  The Ixupi theres  could all maybe? all have different effects based on their element but would also share a common effect When this card attacks  Inflict x points of damage to your opponent.The amount of damage could be equivalent to the monsters attack or a set amount not really sure Im making this up as I go lolThe vessels used to contain the Ixupi could also be utilized perhaps as trap cards to protect them maybe they return to your hand until the end phase or you temporarily banish themThe Meuseum itself could be a field spell that does...something.  Maybe the Ixupi cant be destroyed by battle as long as the field spell remains?Could be an interesting archetype. no thats not just my nostalgia talking what are you talking about,yugioh,davq35o,2,t5_2rpe6

9903072,0,t3_5h94l9,Well contrary to what Mr. uKireL said regarding the monsters tbf though I prefer my Blackwing build to be pure BW I think your Monster lineup should look like x Kris x Shura you want  of Shura and Kris because they are what you start your Blackwing Ladder with when Black Whirlwind is on the field x Kalut only ... can become somewhat of a Win More condition x Bora Kris is so much better Bora is really only for the dank rnk plays and synchros x Gale x Oroshi This is the key card that helps you go into Obsidian Hawk Joe and also Nothung the Starlight having  is just in case the first one gets Striked x Blizzard Only  because it is searchable and you dont want to open with it x Pinaki Only one because you mainly will only bring it out using Shura x Zephyros x Gladius x HarmattanI would also bump Instant fusion to  you want to see it to make the Dankest rnk plays. Also  Torrential destruction is a bad thing nowadays and  Black Sonic your board will be cleared before attacking making this useless. Add  Solemn Strikes. They will help the deck immensely.QampAgt Is MST better than Twin Twisters?In some decks this one included yes.gt Need help with the Extra DeckI would definitely add in Traptrix Rafflessia if you cant open with a Whirlwind this is the next best thing. Utopia and Utopia the Lightning they helps to get over problem monsters.Also look into Ice Beast Zerofyne as it can help if you are going against decks that make big boards or just can get a lot of monsters on the board in general.Imo a good build that doesnt completely break the bank would beMonsters  x Kris x Shura x Kalut x Bora  x Gale x Oroshi x Maxx C x Blizzard x Pinaki x Zephyros x Gladius x HarmattanSpells  x Black Whirlwind x Allure of Darkness x Twin Twisters x Instant Fusion x RaigekiTraps  x Solemn Strike x Icarus Attack x Black Sonic x Bottomless Trap Hole x TimeSpace Trap Hole x Vanitys EmptinessExtra Deck x Norden x Onimaru I run him because I like the big beaters and I dont play Blackwings competitively x Hawk Joe x Raikiri x Chidori x Armor Master I still say run ...if nothing else he is something that forces your opponent to use resources to get rid of. x Nothung x Gram the Shining Star He can make Omnimaru easily! x Castel x Utopia x Utopia the Lightning x Traptrix Rafflessia x Ice Beast Zerofyne,yugioh,daye668,6,t5_2rpe6

Its very evidently a  at the moment Im the TCG with most leaning towards  to maximise the amount of metalfoes in their hand for those big first turn boards as well as to see the bismugear to get the search to help set up fmf. The analysis and suggested amount to run doesnt really consider this fact instead focusing on the negatives. And if you do end up with  in hand you can always use that to make Mithrilium. While I would never be too overly opposed to running it at  I think suggesting  copy is a bit misleading and that every in particular appears very subjective despite the rest of the article reading very objectively.Regardless a good read keep up the good work with the site I enjoy reading the articles on there.,yugioh,db1farh,2,t5_2rpe6

Hell the manga somewhat connects to the anime since we see alternate universe shots in the ds manga that are actual shots from BBT and the last dozen episodes of the ds anime.Also im still trying to persuade OP to read the manga at least the original  volume series. Thats the closest to any Yugioh series that Id rate a . Plus hell be able to enjoy and understand dark side of dimmesnions without reading the manga but theres just so many references and back stories in it which he wont understand at all despite some of them having overall significant effects on the series plot as a whole which is why he should read the manga.,yugioh,db83qom,1,t5_2rpe6

Aside that and phantom fortress you might want too look into kaijus the rank  spiders and the super secret tech of the zodiac engine as you have space and you should be running the terrortop engine in the first place in everything considering how stupid it is. Dont run the level  kaiju its the deadest draw run the s and pick a  ratio with  slumber people get so mad at the deck when it outs problem monsters True kings LOVE gettin strikedwarningbottomless flipped on them.Ive basically been playing the deck like drulers with  maxx veiler dropping them for ogres in the TCG and whoa boy its amazin doing all your plays then drawing  cards.Ethereal Wyrmterfall isnt searchable but ill try it as a  of for attempted draw  during standby for handtrap digging.

You only need  tartle because you only ever want to see it after pendulum summoning. Just look at the deck lists most Performapal engines have been heavily truncated for a reason guitartle and Lizardraw arent the amazing cards you think they are.As for other engines Im not really sure what meshes that well with your deck. I personally am a big fan of the brilliant fusion dracoslayer engine which also has synergy with puddingcess. Honestly pends outside of Metaldoes are pretty bad right now so I havent touched the deck in a while lol.,yugioh,dcbbvv9,1,t5_2rpe6

Editing to make sure stumbling or unclear audio is being heavily stressed. We dont want any factors distracting from the content we want to provide. We want to display a wider variety of content not just exclusive to one area of the community. That may be a bit of reach because you cant please everyone its just the approach wed like. Whether it be displaying decks meta or casual.We hope our own personalities will shine through to entertain any audience we find. Collaboration as a team is very important. Everybody has their ideas heard and utilized in some sense. Regarding the live duels we will have them in an area where surrounding noises will not be an issue of cut entirely with audio edited in.

His monster eff is good to finish up with titanic in those combos but I wouldnt odd eyes him out of the scale if I couldve had abyss there instead and get another DDD from the grave and I can stop shit like utopia from running over crystal.  ,yugioh,dcucbkv,1,t5_2rpe6

10465763,0,t3_5pwr2q,These are from a egg acount on twitter. So take that as you will. New summon sounds horrible and a total rehash of XYZ.  doesnt seem likely. And why punish Pendulums? Sure limit it to maybe three but not a total lockout. Also why not punish other decks then? And why make a new summon which could be exploited by a older one. Sounds fake. ,yugioh,dcuefse,11,t5_2rpe6

10472653,0,t1_dcv33pz,So its called goat format because the format really revolved around goats with only a few cards that directly answered the issue of how goats were able to control the pace of the game. Airknight parshath asura priest enraged battle ox and tiger king wanghu were like the big cards taht dealed with your opponent trying to wall up behind goats. exarion had multiple qualities of a bunch of these cards that made it almost just as centralizing if not making goats more of a liability. Exarion was a dark so it could fit into chaos builds it was a beast warrior so it had synergy in beast decks for a normal summon it was a relatively big guy at  and it had trample so when it ran something over it was taking big lp with it when it came into play. it also blocked parshath and a bunch of other cards youd have access to with its bigger booty as a normal summon. essentially the card is just crazy good for all the things it does. its hard to compare it to a card today because we dont have decks with comparable toolbox potential but id say its like skullcrobat joker of this format in which it just did a bit too much. ,yugioh,dcv6lqv,1,t5_2rpe6

10510312,0,t3_5qg73s,Why run Emergency Provisions when you could run Contract Laundering? Same effect but you also get to draw. Sure its a trap but its infinitely better. I wouldnt run Armageddon unless you run Newton. Newton is fine to run in a casual build imo. His monster effect isnt bad and hes scale . Even in my casual build I didnt run  Beowulf. If youre gonna run  of anything run  Genghis also at least  DArc is nice. If its not too expensive for you run Void Ogre Dragon Clear Wing andor Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend. Theyre around  bucks each and Lamia is made to get them out. Also I used to ru DD ReRoll bc the banish effect is awesome but its not really worth it. Any lost contracts can be easily restored with Genghis or Newton if you decide to run him or readded with Kepler who can be recycled with Thomas so run him. Pot of Acquisitiveness and Different Dimension Reincarnation are better options if you really want your banished cards back. I suppose you could send ReRoll to grave with Copernicus but ReRoll is too slow for me. Its a completely dead draw.Edit Also dont run Recruits. It seems good in theory but its really only useful if you get Raigekid and cant stop it with Siegfried and even then its usually better to have the cards in your grave bc this decks revival is so strong. Like even back when DArc was the newest card in the deck I didnt run Recruits.Edit  Also dont run Contract Change. Its not worth the banish and is frankly just a terrible card. I wanted it to be good but its really not. The search on the level  or lower pendulum isnt worth running a trap with a limited activation window.,yugioh,dczgeqb,1,t5_2rpe6

The reason that the game is so fast is because a lot of decks lack recovery options and simply lose if their opening board is brokenthey are negated from making their board to begin with.

10754672,0,t3_5tv5tl,Yep shaddolls are still casually viable although theyre significantly weakened without Construct. The builds Ive had most success with mix them with Aleister the Eidolon Summoner and co. Your typical objective with Shaddolls is to go first and shut down your opponents ability to use special summoning A first turn Winda is really easy to make and stops them using any Xyz or Synchro monsters and combined with her cant be destroyed by card effects line shes relatively difficult to get rid of assuming your opponent didnt draw into kaijus. Depending on the deck youre up against Anoyatyllis will stop them using spelltrap effects to special summon although very few decks do this now Shekhinaga will allow you to negate the effects of their special summons and Grysta will outright prevent them special summoning. If youre playing Eidolon Shaddolls you can usually get out a Caligula turn  too which will not only prevent them special summoning but also mean they can only use  monster effect each turn and only conduct battle once per turn which is really useful for protecting your stuff. Going second is much harder without Construct but not impossible. Aleisters crew really helps a lot here thanks to things like Cocytus and Purgatorio. Its wise to run hand traps so that youre not caught off guard if you go second. If you can recover then Shaddolls should work fine but its all dependent on that recovery. Biggest thing to look out for? Winda and Caligula nerf you too so if youve got them out play carefully. ,yugioh,ddp9hch,1,t5_2rpe6

Skill wise you are repeatedly doing the same play every turngame of the rat loop this changes come MACR which is better. Due to the previous point and the TCG having  board wipes the mirror becomes less skillful and more sacky. Most of the cards shutdown too many decks. Kaijus shut down Boss decks Dbarrier shuts down monosummon decks Drancia hinders combo decks. In my honest opinion though the fact that Dbarrier is legal at  is what makes it a little too much at times for me Drulers didnt have a card besides vanities that straight up locks you out of the game Vanities could also be played around Barrier couldnt.,yugioh,ddrsvtc,5,t5_2rpe6

10950974,0,t3_5wdqum,Make sure you understand the summoning mechanics beyond Fusion well. Its really difficult to play a deck without them especially if you play Blue Eyes and you will definitely be playing against them. Xyz and Synchro are pretty easy to understand after one read through of a guide on their mechanics but Pendulum is a tiny bit more complicated though it isnt insane and broken like some people say. Blue Eyes was a top meta deck for a few months but it got power creeped very hard and its not even close to tier one anymore and I say this lovingly because I love Blue Eyes and I still play the deck competitively even if its not that great anymore. If youre just going to play casually Blue Eyes is a fun deck and it uses both Xyz and Synchro monsters frequently so itll help you master those mechanics. Im not sure if youre looking to get into competitive play or just casual but either way after you get mechanics down youll definitely want to search up and make sure you understand relevant cards in the meta. Right now were in a format where Zoodiacs an XYZ card archetype dominate competitively. If youre not looking to play in real life at all itll definitely be harder to learn the game without people who already know the game around you to help you out during the process. Im also a college student and I usually go to a weekly YuGiOh! locals near my campus google for YuGiOh! locals near  with your city name. If theres some sort of cardhobbycomic shop nearby there should be a locals because the game is still somewhat popular. However its a difficult tradeoff when you play in real life a lot of good cards are very expensive. Im also a broke college student and Ive spent months saving up and trying to finish off my deck but with some very useful cards currently at  for one its really hard to get everything I need before some new card comes out thats even better than the one I finally bought. If you do decide to play in real life advice for saving money dont buy booster packs. Buy the single cards you need online. Booster packs are a huge gamble. If youre buying single cards online look the correct card prices up online on tcgplayer so you know youre not getting swindled.As for online dueling what the other person said about YGOPro is good. If youre not going to duel in real life definitely try and watch YouTube videos on mechanics how to play recent cardsdecks correctly etc. so that you get some sort of direction on how to play. Im not the greatest player ever but if you have any questions on mechanics Id be happy to help if Im capable.As for the anime GX is generally pretty silly for Seasons  and . A lot of people criticize it for that without finishing the series I personally like lighthearted stuff so it was a fun watch for me but if youre not into that try and stick it out till Season  maybe skip a few of the dumber fillers because... boy the tone of things change there.DS  is a series a lot of people seem to like because its more mature and dark. The plot is cool and all but I honestly got really bored watching a lot of it there were rarely any breaks from the serious parts and I personally like a show that has lots of silly and fun moments along with the serious ones. If youre more into serious stuff though the duels are really exciting the characters are definitely cool and its worth a watch. I just think its a little overhyped because people seem to think a series being darker automatically makes it better. I think ArcV is a great balance between serious and lighthearted though later on its more of the serious A lot of people seem to knock it because it has somewhat childish looking visuals and it starts off fun and silly and probably just nostalgia preventing people from accepting anything new but it does get darker in a very good way later and Id argue that its the best series in terms of not veering on to random tangents and fillers every arc and actually having one overarching plot and the animation is quite nice but characters that were once relevant get shafted quite often for plot fodder for the protagonist which sucks. It also has all of the summoning mechanics included in it so you could watch it to get a basic understanding of the newer ones. Zexal is... strange. It has two parts and part one is not very good probably why youve heard mostly bad reviews because a lot of people dont even bother finishing whereas part two is leagues better. Id say watch it if you have a lot of free time at some point but the inconsistency in plot quality hurts the series a lot because its tough to get through some of the beginning.Sorry for writing an essay here Im a bit passionate about this franchise aha... but I hope it helped a little!,yugioh,de9ikbr,3,t5_2rpe6

You work with what resources you have stocked up in your grave to break down fields and go for OTKs. Problem is that Infernoids arent exactly a resourceefficient deck so any rash moves and you are pretty much doomed.With that in mind some general tipsSeitsemas is your best card. NonTargeting removal while remaining as a beatstick on the field is amazing. Get him in the grave ASAP.Take care when summoning either Onuncu or Devayatynot only they eat up resources they clog the field from summoning more Infernoids.Extra deck monsters are your friend. They provide utilityresource recoveryset up by OmegaMinerva OTK by MetorburstAbsoluteVanilla Syncro spot removal by GalaxyDracosakk and to a extent covers up the weakness of noids. Dont use Feast too rashly. If you are already aware you arent going to get OTKd it is better to save Feast in EP to push for game by multiple spot removals by the small guys and Syncro with Decatron.Whenever using Imagination try to have a big noid up on the fielduntil Ntss comes. That way Tierra wont clog the field. Hope this helped!,yugioh,derp1jm,2,t5_2rpe6

11295307,0,t3_615x9v,Synchros need a way to recur resources. Ive been playing through the various summoning mechanics before links hit and kill a lot of decks and synchros are by far my favorite. In the handful of decks Ive played I found that resources were a huge issue for the decks after the first few turns. This quasar turbo I played was basically hopeless if I got quasar or sifir out and my opponent was able to take care of them because most of my extra deck was spent at that point and what little remained of my main deck wasnt strong enough to hang with any competent deck. One of the things that makes zoo so strong is their ability to recur resources off emeral. If a synchro monster came out that let us shuffle synchro cards back into that the extra deck or maybe even like a chaos synchro you could make by banishing materials in your fraceyard pure synchro builds would be much stronger. I just reread your response and saw you were looking for deck building advice Im so sorry.as far as what you can do now Id say make sure you splash in level eater that card extends plays for days. Wind witches are the bane of my fucking existence but its because theyre super powerful and consistent. Study up on how the core of their engine works and see if youd be willing to incorporate that. Dark synchro can also be a model the quasar turbo I mentioned earlier was essentially a dark synchrosynchron mix. Stardust road will definitely be super useful for protection Id run  in my dark magician deck if I had the room but incorporating board wipes will also be powerful. Finally study competitive decks. More often then not just knowing which gears to throw sand in will be a lot more useful then retooling a deck. Zoo used to kick my ass every time I came across them but when I ran the engine in a celtic guardian deck I understood how it worked and where in the famous zoo combo to disrupt for maximum effect. Likewise learning how most popular modern decks work will help you figure out both how to stop them and how your deck needs to evolve to stop them. Good luck!,yugioh,dfcb1u4,1,t5_2rpe6

11305370,0,t3_61cfdh,Is it possible he is the best?  Sure.  But I firmly believe that there is a soft skill ceiling in Yugioh as well as most other TCGs where once you have developed a certain level of skill further growth as a player has marginal benefits at best.  This is because so many games are determined by the randomness of shuffling cards and additional skill beyond a certain level is masked by the losses due to randomness.  So even though there might be one player who is truly the best that player is impossible to determine from the pool of other top level players.  Compare this to a strictly skillbased game like chess and you can see what I mean.  Grandmasters in chess will win against less skilled players every time whereas in Yugioh an average player paired against somebody like Billy can still win due to the chance his or her opponent will brick heavily or some other situation.In short I dont think its worthwhile to try to determine who is the best at Yugioh even when you consider most premiere wins not to mention many of the best players wont attend as many events as someone like Billy Brake because of the randomness involved with the game that masks a lot of player skill.,yugioh,dfdg3d2,20,t5_2rpe6

11334627,0,t3_61q5kc,In terms of the Action Duels I wish theyd kept up with the creative fields after season . I liked getting to see a new one each time a new environment for the duelists to figure out. Instead we only got crossover and crossover accel both pretty plain and boring I think crossover accel only did action cards there was no environment changes. I dont mind that action cards are convenient theres always been super convenient draws of highly specific cards that are useless in any other situation  I think the action cards are an improved bailout. I liked that the characters could take advantage of their environment to fight.Im a fan of the weirdly religious stuff I would have liked to see more of that. The parallel existed Zarc  the devil. Besides a destructive godlike entity rampages through the world? No way Zarc wouldnt get worshippers even if they had to keep their distance.It would have been interesting to see more people than Leo have memories of the previous world. At the very least youd think there would be Mandela effecttype conspiracy theories stemming from the world splitting right? That would be pretty interesting to explore and if introduced early enough could aid with the foreshadowing. Theres actually a lot that could be explored with the world splitting  just how big are each of the dimensions? Standard is established to have other countries so its probably pretty big. Synchro they arent surprised by people from outside of the City so there must be other places as well. Fusion and Xyz  we really dont know. Xyz cant have been too big in order for there still to be a significant Academia presence in Heartland instead of moving on to other cities.Additionally at what point did these new worlds start? Did they start with the counterparts births? If so how did the history of the world get built up? Did Ray or Zarc create it? Does it have flaws somewhere? Will the illusion break down somewhere if one was inclined to investigate? And that also implies that Reiji who is a couple years older than Yuuya was just...given to Leo. So that leads to another question  were people just randomly married given children their families changed etc. from the original world into one of the new dimension? What if they were married before to someone different had different children parents siblings etc...There is so much that could have been done with Arc V a whole lot of interesting possibilities that could have been opened up.,yugioh,dfgrdly,1,t5_2rpe6

Personally I like to run a soul charge three card advance and two desynchros in mine plus double allures cutting back on the original s to just sit at zebra and moon and dual calligraphers. Going a little over  isnt so bad with such absurd draw power and card advance helps dance around problematic spell clogs... or at least give a warning for when youre about to koi koi yourself to death so you can throw some shuffling in.Hope to ENJOY it until Links come out and kill the combos of the deck since youre utterly dead in the water if they dont for some reason print a Link Cardian and  or you find a way to adequately dance around the cardian summon restriction.,yugioh,dfhtk79,1,t5_2rpe6

11348494,0,t3_61ymit,Now I do agree with you that Yugioh needs some SERIOUS re balancing. Right now the game is in a state where you have one card win conditions like That Grass Looks Greener and can make FULL BOARDS with one to two cards. It just feels like the input right now is far less than the output. I remember a time when Yugioh was actually extremely strategy based and my most fond format would be QuickDraw Dandywarrior format. It was extremely fun to play you were punished for Overextending by Black Rose Dragon. Tributes were planned out Solemn Judgement was actually a card that was played but the cost WAS ACTUALLY STEEP. Imagine a world where people actually lost a game for using  strikes. Thats what the format was like. The better player won a lot more. I honestly feel like theres a big reason for this and that reason is COST. The big and powerful effects of the format that win games have little to no cost. Dimensional barrier more than less ENDS YOUR OPPONENTS TURN and for some reason has no cost? That Grass Looks Greener is a one card win condition that has NO COST just having a bigger deck than your opponent. Cards not nearly as good that mill the deck had COST before. Monster gate forces you to tribute a monster for cost and Reasoning is at one so its inconsistent by nature.The game is very different now its true and its a lot easier for a brainless player to win due to good luck. Hell last Regionals I lost to a guy that opened up GrassMaxx C both games in a  card deck. Not saying my opponent was brainless of course but that COULD happen to anyone. But the fact still remains that the better player will win MORE than the worse player. The chances of the better player winning are just less than before in my opinion.,yugioh,dfibxeb,4,t5_2rpe6

Consider  Whiptail andor adding  Ramram since Ramram can combo quite well with Lyca which comes out in MACR.If you want more of a level  focus you should add some Wolfbarks.  Right now it seems like youre running more of a . axis build which is fine. Handtraps are also great here such as Ghost Ogre andor Ghost Ash another MACR card. For switching entirely to a level  build run  Bear  Gorilla  Dragon and  Wolfbark and probably some more Zoos. Red Resonator isnt awful either. For . axis you might want to cut Gorilla to .Your spells are fine but you typically see Rekindling in . axis just because its that good. For traps  Tensen is completely unnecessary and you might want to get rid of it altogether. Consider  Tensu because it opens up a lot more Zoo combo potential and also consider Tenken since its protection is more relevant than Tensens ATK boost is. Theres also very little reason to run Floodgate Trap Hole without Rafflesia in the extra better would just be Strikes.You need Emerals if youre playing the Zoo engine since the whole point is to boost consistency and draw into your Fire Fist cards more often.

After an encounter against the Atlanteans Spiral wounded finds itself in Pacifis where its wounds are healed and it evolves into the Mythic Radiance Dragon we sea today. Flapping its new wings Spiral then engages in the battle of the Atlanteans and Fire Kings tanking hits from Poseidra literally throwing whirlpools at Garunix and getting a rematch against the Atlantean soldiers.

Veiler can also kill your hand and leave it for dead if you draw into it. Chances are if youre playing against the current meta you run into decks with a shitload of extra deck monsters so effect negating is more valuable than you think.Sure Kaijus can easily run it over but it can also easily run over Chaos MAX.

And the rivals cards were all demons along with a lot of the frightfur cards and Berserk yuya HIMSELF let along his cards seeming very demonic. Im Definately not the first to defend Arc v but if these are your only problems with yugioh anime then Arc v the show right before this new show fits the bill. So Im not quite sure why youre worried.

11622920,0,t1_dgdfdgh,Youve been making arguments along this line since we started with the overhaul way back when. Theyre not grounded in fact but rather in a deepseated bias you seem to have against any sort of restrictions. So dont give us the whole all the more power to you line when youve been against this from the start. And just a few more things. The subs subscriber base has multiplied fivefold in just the past few years.  You can check that much on redditmetrics. We have over k subscribers now whereas when I first joined back in  it was fewer than . Keep in mind these are people who may or may not actively post on the sub but they do follow the sub and its content. If youre following a sub that covers the wide variety of media Yugioh entails do you really want to see shitposts flooding the front page? Do you want to see the same questions asked hundreds of times flooding the front page? If you do then this isnt the sub for you. The fact is we have far more people to cater to than we once did. We cant have this place be a lawless wasteland not then and especially not now as we continue to grow. Some degree of restrictions are necessary to ensure that posts on the sub uphold a measure of quality.. Quantity and quality arent the same thing. Even if you can quantify posts on the sub which you havent yet you just made an unwarranted assertion its more important to us that the posts being made are of acceptable quality than it is that the number of posts being made is on a rapid increase. There are several factors that can affect how many posts are made at any given time new mechanic new setcards new list competitive events and so on. Because of this of course there will be times there arent as many posts being made. This is normal.. While competitive discussions are fantastic competitive discussion is not our sole or primary focus this subreddit exists for people to discuss the many aspects of the YuGiOh franchise. On that front we have the anime discussion threads whenever a new episode is aired manga discussions exist there are discussions about events ranging from YCS down to locals discussions about new cards and more. Like its almost as if were looking at different subreddits because its not the declining community youre making it out to be. Is there more to do? Sure! Thats why we have this thread for people to see whats up and to offer constructive feedback on some proposals or come up with their own. And as I mentioned earlier the subscriber base is rising. With an increase in people viewing and participating in the sub therell always be more to do. But its not helpful to us that whenever we make one of these posts you make some cynical comment about how much the rules suck that isnt even grounded in reality.,yugioh,dgdgwb8,0,t5_2rpe6

11682716,0,t1_dgk0rlx,The issue with Left Arm Offering is that if your opponent chains Ghost Ash then you basically lose the duel however getting your Grass is a very high reward so it really boils down to what actual physical decks you will be facing. If you use this at the local level and no one runs Ghost Ash because of whatever reason e.g. price rarity preference then there is no reason not to play LAO. But at Regionals you are more likely to find players maining  Ghost Ashes so the risk could very high. Its really up to you. I personally run  at the moment but that might change for the reasons I mentioned above.Adding Retaliating Cs again really depends on the actual decks you will be playing. Retaliating C is amazing at disrupting the Lunalight Combo chaining it to Fusion Substitute deals a devastating blow to the whole Zoo deck really so if you predict most decks will be using that combo I would consider playing it. Otherwise Retaliating C might not be worth it since it you cant get rid of it you will also be affected. Honestly Maxx C is such a great card that even if its unsearchable its totally worth running even in a  card deck.Summoner Monk can be good but just keep in mind that you are running some pretty vital Spells Grass Brilliant Fusion etc... so Monk can become a dead card if you dont have anything that can be discarded.,yugioh,dgk93wp,1,t5_2rpe6

SPYGAL instead of a SPYRAL was simply a creative lorerelated decision doing so allowed them to slap better effects onto her. This is probably how she managed to get away with being a spy check top of the deck while being what you referred her to a psuedoKirin. Im glad to see someone running her at  no less as I also think shes pretty good.Regarding your Extra Deck if theres any Xyz Monster I could recommend its gotta be Number  Master Key Beetle.

It can protect SPYRAL Resort or your Missions from destruction effects.Now I have not tried out the new cards from Maximum Crisis but I would not count on getting rid of the third SPYRAL Gear  Big Red.

11708458,0,t3_671kux,Chess!!! With link summoning making it so that card positioning matters now is the perfect time for konami to try again with a chess archetype.All the cards could have protection and destruction effects based on positioning and can move to different places on the field. Maybe even moving their cards into the spelltrap zones or even opponent side of the field.The king should probably be a continous spelltrap or a field spell that helps them generate card advantage thus making them want to protect it at all times.Theres so much they can do with the idea. But they would have to design it carefully so that it doesnt end up like noble knights or bujins where they could make other plays but protecting a single card the whole game is the most common strategy.,yugioh,dgn6mav,23,t5_2rpe6
