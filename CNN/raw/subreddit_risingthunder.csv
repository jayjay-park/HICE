4700894,0,t1_ctmm1wz,THIS! After watching these videos Ive been playing every fighting game differently pressuring to the corner advancing and blocking relying on the best normal and sweep for my character throwing at every possible opportunity and only ever jumping to contain a jumping opponent.I recommend Chel since shes the closest thing to Ryu in this game and all these lessons can be applied one to one. Im currently maining Edge because his moves make sense to me even though they have tricky properties and lots of variants. What I find is that I usually succeed when I stick to these basics and only use these moves when they directly counter my opponent.When you realize that many special moves will beat normals and most overdrives will beat specials the game becomes about playing safe reading your opponent and punishing every mistake.,risingthunder,ctn34ds,1,t5_393uz

4726263,0,t1_ctq9tqh,um .. okay then. of course you dont jump at a character on their wakeup with a DP i thought that was obvious?i think its a little insulting that you think we i cant adapt to new games. i play lots of fighting games all of which have very different flavors to their defensive options. i like to figure out the best way of playing around those defensive options so im doing my best to explore how they work in RT as well.the issue i tried to bring up was this a you dont have to look at the screen to know which way to reversal crossup mixups are difficult or impossible b reversals are safe with KA and possibly advantageous on block cant bait from close range c you never have to leave low block to reversal cant go high in a blockstring unless that high is also part of a true blockstring which i dont believe anything in the game isall of these things slow the game down because the only safe offense i have is to stand outside of dp whiff range and decide whether to press a far button or not. i believe knockdowns should give a strong disadvantage to the defender and  years of every fighting game in history sides with that idea. im sure seth and the cannons would as well.i also think that your analysis of SF neutral is maybe a little off the mark. oh and i had fun with the game yet i also didnt make top  at evo this year.,risingthunder,ctqaakq,3,t5_393uz

4765928,0,t1_ctv4q7x,I think the reason youre seeing this is DPs are frankly better in this game.  Massive hitboxes.  Dope autocorrect.  Big damage.  You also get the meter to make shit safe more often in this game and remember... SFIV nerfed FADC upper cuts too in select cases.At the very least it just makes the game a tiny bit more mindlessflowchart.  Got meter?  Mash DP and cancel on block.

4806355,0,t1_ctzlt5m,I have thought about it I dont find it sad.  I feel unlike some other fighting games the point of RT is to outthink your opponent and part of that whole thinking thing means not just throwing out the same safe cross up  of the time.  A lot and I mean a lot of people come here and complain that winning takes too long because theyre used to just doing the same crossups on knockdown over and over until they win... and this game is giving people options to prevent that and its making them mad because they arent winning all the time with zero brain effort. ,risingthunder,cu0dpq8,1,t5_393uz
4808861,0,t1_cu0ohwu,Sure your Beta skill is the your Second Special usually noted as S.For Talos his first two specials skills are command grabs. these are similar to regular throws except that they cannot be teched out of i think?Taloss second special or Beta as it is noted in the game does an Air grab which catches opponents in the air.two of Taloss grabs can charged by holding down the button. This does three things.A. gives Talos armorB. Adds Magnetism to Talos forcing the opponent near you for the grab.C. increases the damage of the throw if it lands.If taloss beta is charged AND connects he will shove you across the room and bounce you off the wall.ways to counter include not jumping grabbing and spamming light hits.,risingthunder,cu0p35q,1,t5_393uz
4818777,0,t1_cu1xl6g,I dont know if its fair to call his S a command grab.S. would still have combo followup potential with KADC  as well as charge mixups. I would suggest giving it hard knockdown to perhaps make it a little more enticing over the potential . in some cases.Though I have to admit if something like my suggested . existed I would definitely always pick it being able to consistently AA is just so valuable.I think all characters should be able to reliable AA with something be it special or normal.,risingthunder,cu1y2vm,1,t5_393uz

4849932,0,t1_cu5uqwr,Its not unheard of to be able to adjust the match parameters for versus modes. Its still unranked versus. Were just arguing over definitions at this point but these terms have pretty established meanings. It is more correct in my opinion to say that OP is asking for robust versus features than it is to say that hes asking for online training mode. This is an important distinction since if you read the OP hes saying hed rather have it than an AI training mode. I think its a little silly to suggest that adding a couple small features to an unranked versus mode thats already coming is worth ditching essential solo training options.,risingthunder,cu5vbg8,-1,t5_393uz

4911851,0,t1_cucvi0n,Whether they are useless of not depends mostly on how long they are compared to other moves especially when put into plusminus frames situation. In MK for example  frames is considered normal for highs really fast for mids and moves with startup of  frames are fastest things in the game. Then again I expected RT normals to be much faster than MK ones on average rather than somewhat faster maybe. I think slower recovery of everything in MK made me get that impression.,risingthunder,cudobxu,1,t5_393uz
