Merril Jessop already had three wives. But arranged plural marriages were an integral part of Carolyns heritage She was born into and raised in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints FLDS the radical offshoot of the Mormon Church that had settled in small communities along the ArizonaUtah border. Over the next fifteen years Carolyn had eight children and withstood her husbands psychological abuse and the watchful eyes of his other wives who were locked in a constant battle for supremacy.Carolyns every move was dictated by her husbands whims. He decided where she lived and how her children would be treated. He controlled the money she earned as a school teacher. He chose when they had sex Carolyn could only refuseat her peril. For in the FLDS a wifes compliance with her husband determined how much status both she and her children held in the family. Carolyn was miserable for years and wanted out but she knew that if she tried to leave and got caught her children would be taken away from her.
