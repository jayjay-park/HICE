223126,0,t3_1wo7ro,I like SB Brewing Company but youll probably need to get there somewhat early to get a spot at the bar or a table. Hollister Brewing Company while not downtown would be fun also.

If theres a job dealing with grant proposals marketing etc you could couch yourself to be a good candidate. Hell even working as an admin could be a stepping stone to something youre really interested in.My favorite site is indeed.com.Additionally you might check with temp firms to see if theres anybody looking for some help now.

There are many campsites out on paradise road plenty to choose from. I have never camped here only day use as it is so close  mins from Santa Barbara.I prefer davy brown campground on the other side of Figueroa Mountain see  There are plenty of trees for shade and a couple of streams. You are a few hikes to do up to peakscrests that provide great views of the backcountry. It is about . hours from Santa Barbara. You will need an adventure pass year or  per day one needed per vehicle.

4996926,0,t3_3jbfjm,I grew up in IV.  Went to Isla Vista Elementary.  Lived in IV for  years.  Dont live in SB anymore.  Things used to be much different.  There was a unique character that is slowly being eroded.  Of course there was always the party culture but it used to amount to more than just getting wasted playing beer pong.  I think the County and the Universitys efforts to try to stop the partying have only led to chipping away at what makes IV special but the risktaking behavior still remains.  As an example there used to be much more of a live music scene.  If I told you all the bands I saw in IV you wouldnt believe me.  So the Foot Clan started a policy that any keg visible from the street was grounds to enter the party and start carding people.  The result of that was pushing the drinking behind closed doors where fights and sexual assaults are more likely to happen.To be honest Cathedral Oaks and Montecito rich kids never appreciated the culture either.  As far as Im concerned they were just as much tourists as the kids who moved from Irvine last week.  To them IV was a place just to get fucked up and scream Locals Only while they get in a fight with some frat bros.  Only those with truly open minds will ever understand what makes IV special regardless of where they came from.,SantaBarbara,cuobe0u,9,t5_2qqtp

9302848,0,t3_57urb0,What would you like to know?  If you look at the scores you will find that there is a direct linear relationship between the overall score of the school and the age of children from socioeconomicallydisadvantaged households.  In most SB schools students who are not socioeconomicallydisadvantaged do well. There are some schools where  of the students are socioeconomicallydisadvantaged so there isnt data for how the few nonsocioeconomicallydisadvantaged students do.If you are looking at schools by area also remember that there are charter schoolsschoolsofchoice in SB that are very good.  SB Charter and Goleta Family School both take kids from outside their direct catchment areas.  SB Charter even takes kids from outside the district ie Goleta.  Peabody is a also charter school but kids from the catchment area usually take all the spots.,SantaBarbara,d8v7c1c,2,t5_2qqtp

9679954,0,t1_da68hdl,This is some good insight thank you. They actually did give me a second blanket because Ive complained politely about being cold before and asked if there was any way to heat the room up a bit which is when they gave me the blanket. They didnt mention anything about turning on the heating and for this reason I thought may they were just not used. If having a space heater would bring the electricity bill up anyway doesnt it make more sense to just use the heater? Ive never managed electrical bills before so I dont know how big of a difference each would make. Their English is not great either so it can be a little difficult to have discussions with them but I guess it wont hurt to try again.,SantaBarbara,da69b13,1,t5_2qqtp
