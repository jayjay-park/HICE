10310954,0,t1_dccs69o,I was able to prove it out by removing a single thumbnail and that allowed for one more save.    Total box art  thumbnails  save images   maximum safely.  You can always save  more games but the additional  always cause problems.  I would bet that the additional images on the screen such as the individual icons at the top the top background the bottom screens etc. are counting towards an bit address space reserved for all the images in the system and were simply running out.  There seems to be plenty of actual space on the system but its not expecting to deal with anything larger than an bit number so it fails.,nesclassicmods,dccswp7,1,t5_3fm0d

Problem  LED wouldnt turn off after uploading custom kernel and no new games appear when reconnected.Solution  Since every bit matters here download the latest hakchi from here  ... copy the file into the VM before extracting...Use zip rather than standard Windows unzip.

10974916,0,t3_5wouw5,I accidentally stumbled into this last night when doing my first flash of .. Strangely though I did not have issues with oversized save states. Instead SNES save states were not working at all were not created upon reset back to the frontend. Perhaps I should be grateful given the apparent need to factory reset in order to remove them. I did some research last night and arrived at the new Retroarch clover supplied in the OP except the one I downloaded was from this forked version I had a heck of time replacing the core though probably due to some error on my part. First I uninstalled the SNESx core and installed the SNESx core. That alone didnt fix it Im assuming because Retroarch was still expecting the  core. I then uninstalled Retroarch and installed the new version. That also did not work the roms would just not load at all. I then edited the command line for each SNES rom to point at the  core specifically. This also did not work roms continued not to load. Finally in my frustration I flashed back to my previous Hakchi . configuration and then reflashed to . immediately after. This finally sorted it out roms loaded and again generated save states upon system reset. My brief very brief time running a few roms with  suggested that it doesnt run quite as well as  though I guess thats to be expected.It would be great if someone could detail the proper process for addingreplacing cores or switching between two cores as my process above was not ideal and presumably incorrect.,nesclassicmods,dec0eqz,1,t5_3fm0d

11094420,0,t1_depja5y,I like the Classics shoulder button layout more for classic games. Plus this you can hold like a traditional NESSNES pad. Not so with the Pro and its handles. Also its more expensive and Japanese only so youll have to order it online. With the regular Classic Controller you can order it to pick up in store at Gamestop and verify the buttons arent all jammed up before you leave the store.EDIT So I was wrong that the Classic Pro Controller was Japan only BUT it seems like the Pro changed the shoulder buttons from analog to digital So if you wanted analog throttle control for MAME racing games like Outrun or Super HangOn then it seems like Pro is not the better option.The L and R shoulder buttons are also no longer analog as they were on the original Classic Controller.,nesclassicmods,depjjpt,1,t5_3fm0d

You would be better off having ability to hold AB simultaneously for an entire second to start games.  OR even have a second controller remapped so that its start button can start controller  game.  There are several potential ways what you want can be done.
