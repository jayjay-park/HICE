380391,0,t1_cfk2paq,yes it will cause the opposition problems in their own third and in the middle of the pitch leading to turn overs. the problem with this is that it can lead to stamina issues if you do not play at a slower tempo unless you have a team that is physically fit and can handle the higher tempo required to track the ball down as well as playing at a demanding tempo.  I play a swarming style that looks to pressure the ball at all times until it is in my possession and once it is in my possession I play keep away.  Ill keep a normal pace for the first  mins but I crank it up in the second half as I look to exploit tired legs later in the game.  the problem with this tactic is that my WBsAMsCMs are always near  conditioning at the end of games and I require a large squad with good rotation to ensure I can withstand the rigours of a long season.  ,footballmanagergames,cfk6ybq,1,t5_2s0w5

Currently third in the League equal with nd. On my way out of the group stage from CL my group is composed of Real Madrid Leverkusen and Basel. Results so far  lost to Real   won Leverkusen  and won Basel  so im nd.Hoping to finish atleast rd and go as far as I can on CL for this season. I need good performances on Champions League so I can grab the more money I can struggling to stay positive and improve club standards.Overall great save pretty challenging due to poor finances and not so great players at the start. Theyre not all rubbish but the thing is in the beginning I had really no money even for salaries so everytime an halfdecent player wanted a new contract I struggled to offer him what he wanted but at the same time couldnt buy anyone to replace him because yeah no money !With Europe and the Cup win last season its getting better and better so its really nice to notice this improvement from the club. Really enjoying this save so far.,footballmanagergames,cg3hay6,1,t5_2s0w5

Flew through the seasons only  league games and made up various challenges to maintain interest. Focused on developing Icelandic players later taking on the national team job as well helped  top flight teams turn professional to raise the standard of the league took on a newlypromoted side in the second tier as a second manager and went on to win a few titles with them. Even had a third manager on the go at some stage taking Bayern Munich from the second tier to national champions again wanted to continue managing a couple of my youth products that Id sold on taking a newlycollapsed Brondby from third tier back to second and a few months managing Brazil.

989349,0,t3_25djcf,I just started a Palace save myself which Im still in the first season of and its great fun. On my save I asked the board for funds straight away and was surprisingly given around  million to play with which made things much easier since I was able to sign some super cheap teenage wonderkids who could start playing in the squad right away such as Lucas Romero and Rodrigo Gomez out of Argentina. But the only way to really get Chamakh scoring is to play him as a lone striker with  pacey wingers feeding him balls as his technical and shooting ability is poor. Im currently playing a balanced  which I didnt think would actually work with Palace and especially in the first season but it does actually appear to be working pretty well with Puncheon sitting just behind Chamakh as a supporting advanced play maker rather than as an inside forward or shadow striker. Ive also found Palaces biggest weakness from the get go is the defense so getting a decent CD on loan for that first season is crucial to staying in the first division and I was able to get Kyle Bartley from Swansea over on loan who is currently performing like a monster which is basically the main reason Im sitting just slightly above mid table at the moment. ,footballmanagergames,chgqve7,2,t5_2s0w5

If you have the critical thinking skills that help with games like EU its one of my favorite games too football is a game you can pick up at a theoretical level surprisingly fast. Go over to rsoccer  find streams to games over there La Liga and Europa League still have a couple weeks left I believe among other games and frequent friendlies. Major League Soccer is going on still but the way the United States airs and commentates games kind of annoy me think NFL. Read the discussions people have on that subreddit. Youll pick it up in no time.

1167868,0,t3_27i238,The general premise of the tip is to scout heavily in anticipation for when clubs release their players.This involves a blanket approach to scouting. Youre not scouting specific statistics although you could if you wished to. This would be a lot more time consuming however.The idea is to list teams way above divisions than your own. Or if youre a top division team you could target top European teams or teams which you happen to know have excellent youth systems. Scout all of their players. Regardless of whether theyre in the reserves or under s. Youre trying to pick up a bargain or two here.Then when the clubs release players you will already have them scouted. Go to your shortlist and filter players who are out of contract and then cherry pick the best.Im sure many experienced players are familiar with this technique or have something similar. This is my method. It works especially well in LLM situations.,footballmanagergames,ci1078d,0,t5_2s0w5

1368148,0,t1_cinni4l,Note ITT football  soccer NFL  not soccerIm actually still trying to wrap my head around how the transfer system in MLS works. Im very familiar with football American here but not the sport as a whole. How contracts work etc. It took me like a week to understand the concept of a loan because nothing like that is present in any other major sport in America.So Ill reply to you and to uAleccMG with what I know so far written for an American that has no idea what theyre doingSo uAleccMG Im going to assume that you know a bit about other major sports in the US and Im going to try and compare them a bit.In the world of football players have a wage and a value. So in sports like the NBA or NFL a player negotiates a contract for X amount per year with a team. This is their wage and value. Whoever plays that player also owns them and pays for the portion of the years wages that correspond to the portion of the year they belonged to that team. Football is a bit different.In football a player has a value and a wage. The value is how much they would be worth as a free agent to use the term used in other American sports. In MLS theyre called free transfers which is almost identical in concept to a free agent. This is not money that youre paying them this is quite literally their value as a business asset. Its used if you want to sell a player for cash which is how transfers work in football as opposed to trades in American sports.Every player has an owning club and a playing club but unlike other American sports in football they are NOT always the same thing. It is very very common in football all over the world for players to be loaned. A loan of a player is very nearly what it sounds like. For some agreed upon compensation the team that owns that players contract allows another team to actually use them as a player. Often the team which is using the player on loan will pay the players wage and then ALSO pay a fee to the owning club.Additionally the owning club might set some additional restrictions to a loan such as the ability to recall the player basically the ability to cancel the loan agreement without notice the ability to prevent them from playing against you essentially suspending them for one game when the club which is playing them goes headtohead against you or the ability to prevent them from playing in cup matches.Unlike in most American sports leagues where there is a very centralized organization which controls very nearly the ENTIRE sport football typically has several strong organizations in a given geographical area. The MLS has a championship yes the MLS cup but most teams in most leagues have the opportunity to play in more than one cup per year or sometimes even more than one season per year.Football also has upper and lower leagues typically and this is true for MLS as well. The NBA is actually trying to duplicate this with the NBA DLeague with some success but in football the multitier structure of leagues is very important. In many organizations around the world teams can actually be demoted from a higher league to a lower league for performing poorly or promoted from a lower league to a higher one for doing well.It would be kind of like sending the Detroit Lions to the XFL for sucking too much and then adding the XFL championship team to the NFL in their place. Sounds brutal I know.While the MLS doesnt promote or demote teams what it uses the lower leagues for is feeder teams. Essentially instead of having the players who cant crack the starting  or usually get a rotation spot sit on the side the MLS has two squads senior and reserve. This is generally true in football leagues around the world.MLS teams also have youth squads associated with them and whole lower league teams USL Pro. In short the purpose of this for you is to keep your players that you cant afford to play but want to develop playing time. The MLS has a wage cap. Wages are measured and paid in week. As is the salary cap. Your player values can be as high as you want but your player wages cannot exceed the salary cap. What this means is that at times a player may be too good for the MLS. This is... unfortunate but just reality. Ill avoid going into the whole rant here about wanting better quality football in the US and so on. Basically if you cant afford to keep a player on your team because they cost too much in wages for your cap you can sell the player transfer them to a European league. Most of the European league basically piss out the value of your MLS players after one night of drinking so you shouldnt have a problem finding a buyer if they really are that good. As a side note most of Americas good players the ones you saw in the WC play in Europe because the MLS just cant pay them what theyre worth and that also means the competition they face in the US is lower. The biggest exception is probably Dempsey who plays for Seattle.Football clubs are much more intricate in their finances but also MUCH more transparent. No one for instance really knows the exact terms of player contracts in the NBA or NFL and the total revenues and costs to the teams in those leagues are just estimated. Only the teams know. In the MLS and generally football clubs around the world contract terms and finances are more transparent which facilitates the loantransfer system used throughout the world.Unlike other major sports in the US that sometimes operate as the toys of billionaires football teams tend to be run like actual businesses. That means you need to go talk to the board about things like funding your training facilities. The board also sets things like the maximum amount of salary youre allowed to offer someone in a given position player coach scout etc.You also have a transfer budget set by the board and the MLS. This is the amount of money every year youre allowed to use on buying players. Now... to how transfer and trades work in MLS... In the MLS you can transfer a player for another player. This is actually something that almost no other league on the planet does just MLS. The reason the MLS allows this is The transfer budgets for teams in MLS are laughably low compared even to the average MLS players value so straight purchases are difficult. American sports fans in general are familiar with trades in sports. The MLS has a draft system also something virtually no other league in the world has so trading things like picks is very useful.There basically four ways youll get new players Transfers which includes trades and signingbuying players that are free. Drafting Promoting from your youth team LoansThe third one takes several years to really be consistently good and drafting cant fill immediate needs so transfers are important. Youre going to be looking for players that will fit in your teams tactics that are VERY cheap... like values under k mostly.Also note MLS teams are limited to a certain amount of international nonAmerican players. Players coming out of your youth program will be American but early on especially youll need to sign international bargains to save yourself from being fired. You can actually trade international slots... so you could trade a youth prospect to another MLS team in exchange for one of their international slots for the next two years giving you an extra international slot during that time. Or you could trade YOUR slots away. You just cant have more international players on your team than you have slots at any given time.The MLS draft is for selecting three kinds of players American college players and only American college players not Canadian Any player who is not currently signed by a team anywhere else in the world that wishes to play in the MLS Players which are under contract with the MLS but not under contract with an MLS teamAsk the board to improve your youth facilities the first three years. This helps later in the game. You can have MLS youth programs pumping out  star players if you can convince your board to spend heavily on your youth programs but itll take  years or so.Compared to other popular sports in America football is INSANELY complicated in how the league and the teams are run and it involves a TON of domain specific terms and language youll have to learn. Google is your friend.For an MLS team the first few years it will be your tactics coaches and training that saves you. Put together the right tactic and your team will be able to go at it with the cup winner. This is mainly because FM has a SHIT implementation of the MLS compared to other leagues. Even so I really enjoy playing the MLS because its challenging in ways that other leagues arent.Your youth academy is where your longterm source of success lies. Make sure to keep asking the board about getting better facilities and possibly spending more on youth development coaches.Theres other things I didnt cover like the waiver draft but honestly its a monster to tackle MLS in FM if your experience with the sport is watching the world cup.It is deeply rewarding though you just have to willing to feellook stupid and ask questions. Dont worry about being the silly American that doesnt know the sport other people are generally giving you trouble in good fun. Its more important that you ask and learn about the things you dont know.I guarantee if you take the time to wrap your head around the stuff playing the MLS in FM will not only be fun youll start to become a genuine soccer fanatic and have almost no option except to follow the real MLS as well theres MLS games this week if you arent interested in the WC now that the US is out.Im also a silly American so others should correct me where Im wrong.,footballmanagergames,cinsb5t,10,t5_2s0w5

1428159,0,t3_2agt8n,The quality of your players matter.For years Ive been into developing tactics based around quick shortpassing play. The holy pantheon of stats I look for in my system? Passing technique first touch and off the ball. Creativity pace acceleration and flair are welcome.  All the other stats are dependent on the role of the player.You see when FM shows the required attributes for a certain role it only shows the minimal requirement. You might have a beast of an anchor man if he lacks the technical requirements to play a quick short passing game... hes going to be ineffective.As others have said... Formation is a preference. Im Wengerlike in my obsession for creative AMCs so I rarely employ wingers. I instead rely on my fullbacks to support width. This means however that I will at the very least need a halfbackanchorman to shore up the CBs. Etc. etc.Those are the kinds of considerations uMcRide refers to.Some general tips however. Dont bother playing fluidvery fluid with shit players. If your aim is to play possessionbased football a rigid formation can work equally well. It wont be Total Football but you will not be caught out by better teams either.. The lower you manage the more the importance of physical attributes. This also means that more direct styles of play are preferable to styles that require greater technical prowess.. Tactical efficiency is to a large extent relative. A League squad with a clear technical superiority to other teams in the league can afford to play a more technical game. However dont expect your League  TiqiTaqa to work against Arsenal in an FA Cupmatch. Youll get destroyed.. Get a feeling for maybe the most important TIs Shape. A deepernarrower shape works well to limit space in your own half. If you want to play an aggressive pressing game youll want your defensive line to move higher up. A short passing game works well with a narrow shape while a direct passing game works well with a wider shape.. Mental stats. Mental stats. Mental stats.

Defensively youll need to be all about making sure the full backs get enough cover. You have you BWM who will roam and cover but youll also need you CMs to cover out wide as well. Going forward it seems youre relying a lot on Fleetwood to get alot of goals which in the BSS isnt the end of the world. When creating a tactic you need to think a large part about transitional play your starting formation will be the shape you defend in.  isnt the most defensive shape but it can certainly be done Like here   Going forward youre looking pretty good. When your tactic is in full flow from what I can tell your shape will almost be a  or there abouts so youre not going to have trouble with men getting forward. The problem will be because so many pitches are so shocking in that league a lot of the team youll play will play long ball counter attacking football or Stoke football as I like to call it. You could quite often come up against v v situations at the back so be wary of that. The best thing to do as uSunTzusWetDream pointed out is to watch your tactic see if its doing what you want and notice any problems with it that can be exploited. Even if you win all your friendlys it doesnt mean you have the worlds best tactic try and notice space that can be exploited. Concentrate on the transitions of Defence to attack for either team pause the game and try and spot where the goal threats and defensive areas are. ,footballmanagergames,cj6dli4,1,t5_2s0w5

1540534,0,t3_2bveuk,New staff can pose quite a few costs some of the ones I can think of are as follows... . Transfer fee  some coaches usually at big clubs require you to buy out their old contract this can vary from a few  to k in some instances. Unemployed staff are free of course. Travel cost  depending on your scout set up and board limitations you will have to pay to send scouts around the world to watch prospects can be quite costly if they are always roaming . Training costs  some staff go on training courses that the club sometimes pay for to improve their coaching im not sure how this actually impacts their ability. Contract costs  this one is dependent on how good the coach is in the first place for your club long term inevitably you will want to improve your staff once you climb the tiers of football leagues. If you have a crap coach on a reasonably high wage on a long contract you will have to pay to cancel his contract when you plan to replace him ive seen this run into the millions coaches ability like players will improve over timeThats the main costs I can think of I wouldnt say skimp on coaches but for the very lower leagues they will have barely any impact on your players development fitness and physios and a decent scout are usually my prioritiesHope that helps a little  ,footballmanagergames,cj9dp7y,2,t5_2s0w5

Maybe more flexibility is needed with various other tactical tweaks but I liked having to try and create a tactic that combined a series of verbal commands as opposed to simply numbers.

One thing Ive noticed though and maybe this is my imagination is that a counter attacking tactic feels more sensitive to familiarity. When my teams were still learning it wasnt very effective but once they settled into it we went far. As opposed to some more standard tactics that feel less susceptible to familiarity.

Then my DM gives away a penalty it was such a bad penalty it gave him a . match rating in the th and just like that its . One more here gets them through on away goals so I decide to park the bus. My team was quite good defensively and my bus parking tactic had been getting great results against Real Madrid Bayern etc.  real giants  so I was confident Milan wouldnt break through. And then in the th minute my left winger scores. In the wrong net.  Milan lead on away goals.Well fuck Im screwed! I say to myself. Ive already burned my subs! I throw everyone forward into overload take more risks goalkeeper on attack the whole nine yards.  I get a highlight popping up. Its a free kick. Im internally facepalming already. My team never scores from free kicks. The taker blasts it against the wall of course but it comes right back to him. He cuts inside takes a shot and... HOLY SHIT!! HE SCORES!! !!!I jump around my room punching the air in delight and Im not ashamed to admit that either and shouting. I quickly calm back down back to business.

2589847,0,t3_2pdm8j,me and all of my mates play online a LOT. One thing is you need to set a lot of time aside for it. Especially during transfer windows. These take especially long because everyones trying different deals at different times. so it could be on each day there is at least one person with a transfer related notification meaning the game never goes more than one day at a time. If I remember correctly it took us around  hours before even getting to the charity shield this is WITH simmed friendly matches. However after that theres not as much people can do so it generally moves a lot faster through nonmatch time. REALLY recommend online though. Theres nothing quite like beating your friend  in an important match and laughing at them about itafter this happened my friend was actually so pissed off we had to take a break so he could calm down. Absolutely hilarious.also feels less stale as playing through  seasons alone where once you win a champions league or two you can essentially dominate basically unrivalled.

His stats were quite good for a  year old but he was a bit rubbish for  seasons and I nearly let him go for k. I got a really bad injury crisis though so had to keep him in the squad for the start of his third season.Now about  years later hes scored between  league goals in Serie A every season since. One year he got  in all competitions. This is more impressive than it looks because I have three first team strikers and an up and coming youngster that try to give equal playing time to. He tends to average a goal every  mins. Not too shabby for k. Did I mention he was only on  about  pw too?  My other good transfer blew my expectations in an entirely different way. I bought him for  million in January he was shockingly poor but scored in the last game of the season to help me win my first Serie A title then I sold him for  million in the summer to Real Madrid where he has consistently underperformed ever since.,footballmanagergames,cnzom9d,4,t5_2s0w5

3250828,0,t1_coyy59z,I find the players just dont move as fluidly as that in FM which is a shame since my tactics depend on fluid movement. Most premade tactics for FM typically go for overloading of the penalty box rather than actual movement of players and usually stop working after the nd or rd seasons.There are new roles raumdeuter wide playmaker inverted wing back and complete wing back on support duty. Only the raumdeuter role is actually useful even then its a very specialist role. You also have a wider range of shouts for crossing and pressing. In the match analysis and league stats you also get to see player mistakes without having to figure it out manually. ,footballmanagergames,coyygn1,3,t5_2s0w5

Slow defenders? Play a little deeper poor composure and decisions? slower style of play lack of pace? try a patient build up and a more considered approach where their lack of pace wont be highlighted.Finally your style of play. Want to play attacking but have the shortcomings listed above you might want to overload a midfield with  or even  players occupying the middle of the park to keep possession but also make it tough to break through.are you going to be weak at a quick passing style and struggle to keep posession a counter attack based tactic with pace on the wings and upfront are gonna be your friend.Its all about maximising the good side and minimizing the weak points.There will always be a compromise of course or perhaps you want to play a different style than your players are capable of playing if thats the case you had better be prepared to get your hands dirty in the transfer market VikingDan  ,footballmanagergames,cpjzikl,7,t5_2s0w5

3657337,0,t1_cq931hl,gt  I think its super realistic the fact that you have to struggle. I see these saves with  seasons of straight promotion and i dont know how they do it.I thought the same thing until I tried it out it really surprises you. You accept that youre going to struggle to stay up after your first promotion but then you win  games on the trot all the while wondering what is going on. The teams at lower levels are just so close in terms of quality a human manager has too much of an advantage. It tends to even out at the second league i.e. the championship as the quality gaps begins to widen.Lower league management is a piece of piss in terms of winning games it just tends to fall apart when you need to renew contracts as usually they ask for way too much. The main challenge is certainly the financial aspect which means letting go of your best players Especially your most promising youth players whenever a half decent offer comes in. For example k for a  year old future championship or premier league player does not seem like a good deal but if you can get  free agents in for that amount of money who can help you fight for promotion do it.,footballmanagergames,cq95udz,2,t5_2s0w5

Also with it being a laptop its likely that video memory wouldnt be any higher than MB mine is MB due to it being integrated into the motherboard. This shouldnt affect too much besides the D match engine though.I know its a pain since you said its new but it might be worth returning it and getting something with a more powerful processor. Youll probably want to be looking at around GHz and above ideally. Something with an Intel Core i or perhaps a Core i.Also look at getting an SSD.

I get his ratings not being that spectacular playing DM because DMs always get screwed on ratings but even when I played him as an AP at CM he was still very average.On my current save hes a regular starter for Man City and it looks like theyre having better luck playing him as a CM than I was.,footballmanagergames,cqvrxwt,1,t5_2s0w5

3973061,0,t1_cr92ual,I look forward to your creative and impressive kit pack with anticipation. ,footballmanagergames,cr95ujc,2,t5_2s0w5
3973108,0,t3_35ybeh,I think your chief concern is that youve taken a narrow tactic made it narrower with an instruction and then asked your players to play with a high tempo but be really cautious about things Retain Possession and Play out of Defense.  As a result youre asking your team to play a hightempo highpossession game with very very little space in which to work especially in the attacking third.  Yes this might work fine with world class players but youre asking a lot of your team.One of the better FM tactics for possession is the  with  across the back a DM two CMs WingersInside Forwards in the AMRL positions and one center forward.  The primary reason that particular formation works well for possession is good spacing which allows players a time amp space to pass the ball b space to close down without damaging the shape too much defensively.Having said that if you want to keep most of the elements of your current tactic heres what Id do.  Change Giroud to a CFs and make him the lone striker..  Drop Sanchez next to Ozil and make him a SSA and also change Ozil to APS..  Make Chamberlain a CMa and Ramsey a CMs.  Change Flamini to a DMD.  Change Debuchy to a WBa and Gibbs to a FBs.  Change instructions to only  Retain Possession Work Ball Into Box Play Wider Close Down More.  Switch to Control and Structured.  If in a match you need more attacking feel free to move to Attacking and change to Be More Expressive.  If that isnt working move to Fluid and Roam from Positions..  If in a match you need to be more defensive go to Standard or even Counter if necessary.What this is going to do for you is the following.  Giroud will hold up the ball and look to fashion chances for Sanchez and Chamberlain as they go streaking past him or dumping it to Ozil for a quick piece of creation Ozil hopefully having taken advantage of an opponent not paying attention to him off the ball..  Ramsey and Flamini provide some structure in midfield as a way to control and shuttle the ball especially Flamini..  Both wide defenders but especially Debuchy provide better width and some good attacking.  In particular you should have Debuchy probing upfield parallel to Chamberlain on the opposite side of the formation allowing options while Gibbs is providing defensive cover as Chamberlain goes forward.Anyway I hope that all helps.  Good luck!,footballmanagergames,cr961h3,2,t5_2s0w5

4216834,0,t3_395uuj,I had a long running save with U.S Alessandria in the Italian Serie C. It lasted like five years ingame but I managed to get them promoted to the Serie A and eventually we started to challenge for European spots in our last season. The top half of the league was super competitive with all the big names vying for position and here we were some lowly team from Piedmont going against the likes of A.C Milan Back when they were a team Juventus Roma etc. and proving our worth. It pretty much came down to the last game for us to stay in position for a European spot with Lecce one point away from taking it from us.I get suited and booted for the big match against Torino who had been in the relegation zone most of the season. They had really struggled and we had already beat them once. My team was pretty healthy coming in and I made minor tweaks to the team before the match. I mean come on we were going to be in Europe next season for the first time! Alessandria had risen from the grave and regained some glory. Right?!? Nope.The game ended up being a total slugfest and as we got to  minutes I will never forget the time it was tied . My goalkeeper of all people was injured and I realized to my horror that I never put another keeper on the bench. I put a fucking regista on as a damn keeper and said fuck it. Thankfully it came down to extra time and even though the clock said  minutes added time the referee kept play on into the th minute. That is when my dream ended and one of their left backs scored from a damn cross that came in at a strange angle. I will never forget the frustration and hatred I felt that day. I started cussing and just walking through my house shocked at  A.M. My girlfriend at the time woke up and thought something had happened and was wondering why the hell I was up at that time dressed up in a suit with a scarf around my neck. I will always hate Torino and I hate them still. Some times I download the editor and destroy their team just to see them get relegated.,footballmanagergames,cs0wi5r,5,t5_2s0w5

I would go back to  .It is a lot but why is this a bad thing? I figured it might make it harder to learn but they seem accomplished with it fairly quick do they struggle to follow them when theres too many?gtYour wing backs are offensive and the  remaining defenders have no cover from the midfield. That is suicide. Just look at how teams play in real life. No team plays this offensive. You could put the wing backs in a support role and let one midfielder play close to his defense I think youve changed that already.Yes this is the biggest mistake I think this tactic has I changed two of the CMs to BWMD and CMS to try to balance it out but I havent changed the CWBs do you think this is enough? Ill see how my goal record is after a month or two.gt CM players on attack is probably to much as well. Try  on attack  on support and  on defense.Ahh! This is what I chose! Great minds think alike eh?gtI wouldnt play with  Inside Forwards. Pelle needs crosses and the IFs could be in the way of the attacking midfielder if they cut inside the whole time. Maybe make one IF with the best cross a winger on support or attack.Ahh this is the stuff I need to learn! Crosses are winger play and IFs cut inside and play like narrow attacking mids right! Cheers for thatAlso I ended up scrapping IFs alltogether to play a front narrow  with Pelle AF Mane F and a DLF which I think I started training Tadic to play.

Change your wing backs to full backs on support put a DM in front of your defense as ball winning midfielder on defend a DLP on defend in front of him and change coutinho to an attacking midfielder. Put both wingers on support.  For instructions try more direct passing run at defense higher tempo more closing down exploit the flanks look for overlap stop GK short throws be more disciplined.

4615086,0,t1_ctc9o33,Huh thats the first time Ive ever heard about the so called grid formation. I was aware of the corners exploit but I think that the situation might be a bit exaggerated because on a save that I had with a weaker team I think I received about  goals from crosses and corner kicks even though I had a very solid measure against it. So I think more than an actual exploit though it suggests the same idea its perhaps something generally broken with the game itself though I am unsure about that since Ive been hearing so many people complain or pride themselves with how well they were doing because of it. I am uncertain on why SI wouldnt direct the issue either. It seems to me like a pretty crucial thing to disregard. Are you saying that all formations with  strikers are potentially gamebreaking though? Or just the one you described? Because Ive played most of the games against weaker teams with a very aggressive  formation until establishing some sort of lead which usually happenedhappens quite quickly for me. ,footballmanagergames,ctcb7k6,1,t5_2s0w5

4834424,0,t1_cu3bls0,A few years back I was the main author of a massive  page completely free ebook called The Guide The writing the analysis and the research took over one year to complete.  It was a labor of love for me so to speak.I spent over  hours just pulling apart the game and while I did not publish anything regarding specifics within the Match Engine I used those findings of the parameters of effects to help people better understand how the game thinks not actually works.  I wanted players to understand the games potential through cause and effect  rather than say if you do X then there is a  chance of Y happening as long as Z is effecting it.Also I really wanted to keep some mystery in the game otherwise the game looses its luster a bit.  After I finished the book spending an average of  hours a week on it I couldnt play the game for a year.  I was done with it.  I am glad I wrote it in such a way that the game hopefully wouldnt lose any of its magic after reading it. I wanted it to enhance the managing experience and to present seeming simple situations in different ways to experienced players so they could see things in perhaps a different light and come to understand the ideas and theories that we presented and pushed forward.  It was meant to ease firsttimers into the game and completely reinvent how lifelong fans of FM looked at the game.Anyways this frankly insane level of research allowed me TONS of data to interpret and understand. As I understood the inner workings more I found that there are are very very few things in FM that are influenced by less than  separate attributes or states.  This showed how the whole concept of understanding the larger picture means more then understanding the details of every event.  There were very few ABC situations and tons of if A exists and B is possible C may factor into it given that the value of C is greater than D but only if D is less than E...In other words it pays to think with a larger scope than micromanaging each decision.  There are just too many variables to worry about with every single decision. However the more you understand the overarching concepts of which things are actually connected the better decisions you will make. The best way for me to sum up how to play the game is this  You need to see the forest at all times but you need to know how each individual tree in the forest is connected to the others in order to understand what it takes to make the trees grow and still be the forest you want it to be. As far as ingame research goes I simulated the exact same match over  times introducing just a single change and running it  times to get a spread on the possible effects.  I had one hell of a spreadsheet going...This massive pile of data revealed to me some surprising things.  Chance for instance plays a much larger role within the ME than most people previously accounted for. The data also showed that by playing smart with your shouts you could easily see that making the right decisions at the right times did increase the odds of success within the Match Engine.  The data further revealed that even with nothing changed the game adapted to the specific situation that it was facing at that time with increased success due to their choices if left unchecked by the human manager.  I determined that the AI is indeed adaptive depending on the simulated AI manager that the AI is effective in its decisions and that the AI was burdened with the same effects of chance as human managers are.The culmination of that year was The Guide thats the free download link from FMView.net and while it is not  percent accurate as there have been some changes over the last five years  of it is still deadonballs accurate.  I am particularly proud of the breakdown of each position and each role for the position and the effects of each duty that can be assigned.  It discusses various attributes that are needed for maximum performance outside of the key recommended ones and is presented in such a way as to allow you to reassess how you may perceive the role functions.The bit on vertical bands is another thing I am quite fond of.Anyways I am my own source for almost all of my information  I took apart the game read the code and ran more simulations than Id care to admit to understand exactly just how the game goes about its business.,footballmanagergames,cu3x275,1,t5_2s0w5

Two fullbacks one set to FBS and one to FBA or WB and IWB and they can alternate roles. Going further the wide players ahead of them could be linked to either cut in or stay wide depending on the player behinds role.At the moment you would have to set up two separate tactics in different slots and manually switch between them as much as possible which isnt helpful.,footballmanagergames,cubb471,2,t5_2s0w5

5056327,0,t1_cuu5d98,Im late to the party here but to piggy back onto your comment. Id also like to see a top four list of who each positionplayer should be looking to pass to. Also controlling where each person would look to run to and in what scenario. Overlapping fullbacks a AM pushing past a striker etc etc. These are all in the game but Id love more fine tuning.Another thing would be dynamic player roles. Covering swapping position and all of that jazz. E.g. if your FB pushes up your CB fills in on the FB position and a DM would move into the vacant CB position. There is a lot more potential to this obviously. For a current example of the type of thing youd be looking at replicating you could use Arsenal or Bayern Munich. Also Id like training to be a bit better. Youth trainingintakes too.

Start getting some form together midseason  games unbeaten in January  wins  draw do I get manager of the month? Nah Lehmann. February I win all  games surely this time I get the award? Nah Lehmann again. March looks like I could make playoffs now Lehmanns Charlton thrash me  again.

Eventually I get there win the play offs and Im promoted.Next season in the championship. Doing well squad mostly made up of loan players has me kicking around th in the table. Start to do well putting together title challenge. Down to  horse race Reading are dropping off its just me and Cardiff now for the title. Check their team. Lehmann. He took their job in October and turned them into title challengers. Presumably hes more concerned with making my life miserable once again though.

However if youre at a lower league team e.g. Accrington Stanley  then even the squad players for higher a teams will have high star ratings as they are better than your average players. The values talked about above are potential ability. This and current ability are two hidden stats that players have. anything above  or so is usually a very good player with  being essentially the best footballer in history. FM has lots of these hidden stats but for starting out theyre not all that important star ratings are certainly useful when starting out and youre not sure what exact qualities you personally want in a player. tldr star ratings arent nonsense  but arent perfect either  and are relative to your team,footballmanagergames,cwhwp6g,3,t5_2s0w5

5752361,0,t3_3tsl7n,Just done the same with Grimsby Town Go fuck yourself Lincoln  the key at non leagueleague  is to try and judge CA yourself. Find players with attributes that hit  in the areas you require that player to be good at  the rest of the attributes really arent all that important at the moment.What I have done regarding transfers after winning promotion which started  months before promotion was even confirmed was to scout pretty much all players running out of contract at the end of the season or who were out of contract already. Then try and focus on younger players who have room to improve but still have good attributes in the areas that you need. Ive managed to bring in several players who certainly can perform at league  level alongside those who I deemed good enough to stay in the squad from nonleague and now Im pretty upbeat at my chances of back to back promotion.The key thing to remember at this level is that scouts dont just put ready made superstars on your screen  you have to spend a lot of time searching through players to make sure you can get the best possible talent available.,footballmanagergames,cxa4vyx,1,t5_2s0w5

Id just like to read your reasoning for this.The obvious weakness is your right flank but I guess you have a ball winning midfielder there plus a wingback on automatic. Im assuming that your offence concentrates on your left flank but in that case why have your right wingback that far up the pitch? To close down the enemy winger earlier? Because surely your virtually three man defence should be able to cover any crosses. To pull off the offside trap easier? This would be my guess.Also why have the complete forward there? To be in the middle of the Ramdeuter and the Advanced playmaker? Then why not just have them in the centre of the pitch and have a narrower final third? Why have the complete forward on support? I can see you have Calleri Welbeck and Walcott all of which I think would be better off with an attacking mentality.,footballmanagergames,cym8qlt,3,t5_2s0w5

I also switch the CM from AP to CM attack and he kind of partners with the regista and they help each other up and down the field with the CM making easysafe passes and maintaining possesion while the regista looks to open up the defense with a killer ball.

If you make sure you scout the players a couple of times when theyre on your shortlist youll get a nice file of them. I have a couple of shortlists wonderkids Italian internationals Italian youngsters and SouthAmerican youngsters. The shortlists make it possible to buy your targets at the right time. Making it really easy to see when they are on the transferlist or when their contracts are ending.As for the buying process theres one tip I can give but it is a form of cheating so I wouldnt recommend it. In my first try with a FM I sometimes load and save a lot to see how the offering process works. What kind of clubs require what kind of payment?

7029885,0,t1_d1d6jbc,Short answer Sort of.You have a squad with a salary cap. You can buy and trade international slots currently I have  I think  is normal so you can definitely sign European players. BUT you can only have at most three designated players whose wages can be anything but only count against the salary cap as pw. Any player that you sign for a transfer fee MUST BE offered a Designated contract. Using allocations funds in a trade with another MLS club is not a transfer fee. Yes the rules are complicated. Sorry.You have no youth team as such. Your youth team is really more of a feeder team but you hold the players rights even if they leave the feeder team when they turn . You can offer these players contracts at any time.You can also sign players in the January superdraft they are normally yrs old but you can sell your draft allocations if you want.,footballmanagergames,d1d6wm3,4,t5_2s0w5

7472686,0,t3_4hq1ln,Hiya mate based on personal experience Probably a very bad idea to use a high defensive line without proper pressing you need to stop the opponents from having the time to pick out an attacker with a clever through ball. Either sacrifice possession by having a deeper line or put pressing on more or much more to be combative and disruptive. You should probably alternate which one based on opponents directness and pace of attackers. To help with the possession issues I would suggest going with prevent short GK distribution get stuck in drop this down to normal if you notice the referee is strict and look for overlap. But I wouldnt worry too much about possession if you are not giving up many chances which should be the most important thing. Retain possession might be counterproductive for the tactics youre playing.Everything else seems alright at worst just make sure your goalkeepers individual settings for distribution match up to what you would prefer big ball over the top for the forward or throw it out to the full backs to build up more progressively.,footballmanagergames,d2rllxi,1,t5_2s0w5

7585217,0,t3_4j6qle,Very interesting match  although they dominated in terms of possession and overall shots you had by far the better chances assuming that the clearcut chances actually were the engine counts some questionable ones sometimes so both teams could probably come away disappointed...although a tie on the road away from Bayern is actually quite a good result for you I feel like your dissatisfaction is more from not being able to play the way that you wanted to rather than the actual result.Tactically I think the major problem and one that leaps out from the detailed stats that you link in one of your comments is the sheer number of key passes that they played and the number of crosses that they had  you were playing a very narrow formation whereas they were loaded up on the flanks and with two really skilled fullbacks meaning they probably always had a spare player on each side and could easily move the ball around. Your formation change didnt help with this because your advanced wide players are basically forwards and probably didnt track back enough to help your fullbacks.All of this is made worse by having to play secondchoice CMs against a very strong CM trio for Bayern especially in the secondhalf where you basically went for in that area.,footballmanagergames,d34ehix,1,t5_2s0w5

One of your midfielders should be a BWM one AP and one BB. Between the three of them they convert defense to attack. In defense the BB comes back to support and your BWM tries to win the ball in midfield. If you go for  your DM can close down space between midfield and defense or build from behind and make long passes to quickly turn defense to attack. During attack your BB surges ahead for late runs and edge of the box shots while your AP tries to make killer passes that skip his DM altogether. At the same time your WBs will move forward and make it a  vs  situation against his defenders. That is very aggressive and very effective since usually people like you have  extra defender against a ST but here you have  defender less.

Hard to know without details but maybe you are crossing too much or too little passing too much or too little? Who knows! Experiment. Dont use work ball into box. Tell your players to run at defence or shoot on sight. Maybe you simply arent getting your players into dangerous positions often enough.

8327651,0,t3_4tmki5,I play MLS near exclusively and I have a regen from the academy since he was . If I had to guess his PA is probably around the number yours has since hes consistently  to . stars during his prime and averages around .. rating each season. He will be stuck at that number. What will happen is his stats will redistribute so over time you see things like  Corner  Crossing etc. for all his nonused stats mines a limited defender. He may still be adequate though if his performance is good enough so dont just dump the guy despite his low ceiling. A consistently mediocre player can still help you achieve greatness. On that note asking price is definitely driven in part by recent performances so if you are going to play him often you may get a better deal in a year or two. Since you are playing MLS I tend to look for these when trading with other teams  International Slots. Permanent if possible .m  Allocation funds. This is capped at k per deal though but money is needed especially if you go over the cap every year like I do  st round draft picks.

Just take  note on  what you see how you concede who loses the ball is the system working as intended are you creating chances through wideplay?. To be honest I dont see anything  inherently wrong with the tactic in general. Having a holding player either a CMD or DLPD in that strata will bring a lot more balance and should improve performance. Other than that if you intend to sit deep and concede possession there is nothing wrong with your choices imo. Winbacks on defend will still sit deep thus they will rarely support attack and for the most be disciplined. There is lack of movement so you could struggle to break down sides but if you intend to play on the counter it wont really matter. Wingers could be isolated but your forwards should drop deep and link the attack properly. In regards to TIs you could do away with most of them if not all of them.

What are they supposed to be doing?Right now it looks like all  midfielders try to feed the DLF and he tries a through pass to either wide player. There seems to be very little else going on.There are a million things you can do based on what I said but thats up to you to decide what you want to do.Start thinking of a plan B when this will inevitably start to fail as teams deny you more and more space in the final third. Either get one of the two wide players linking up more or get support from midfield forward quicker. Id go with the former. And think about getting at least  fullback involved. I cant see them doing too much either atm.,footballmanagergames,d7xvef2,2,t5_2s0w5

9649043,0,t3_5d6x0r,Im maybe not the best person to give advice but seeing your key players stats and PPMs would help.What is your team good at? What strengths and weaknesses do you have compared to your opposition. Where are you struggling? Conceding failing to score? Ect.Looking at this your home tactic is very intense. Very high tempo tons of closing down very wide. How is that working? Without knowing more I would tone it down. You are probably tiring your players out quite a bit and unless you are a very strong team I think you are relying too much on your players winning one on one.Maybe leave such extreme settings available to make adjustments. Unless you have really high stamina decisions and first touch all round i think you are probably rushing your players and not giving them time to make plays.Id say similar things to say about your counter tactic. I dont like that one very much to be honest. Even though it is counter you are still playing a very aggressive style which I can see you getting manhandled by strong teams. I agree with Hrster but dont really want to give advicesuggestions about more player roles without knowing your players.Hopefully this helps somewhat.

9806190,0,t3_5fo1su,So if you havent tweaked anything in the tactic you should have  players on AT duty and  on SU  this should be enough to produce some shots. Try looking at some matches on full detail to see whats happening. If your attackers have a lot of playable balls but rarely shoot then either they have too conservative instructions or they are being constantly stopped by the opposition defence. You could try to put them on shoot more dribble less if they are losing  vs  battles and so on. Otherwise if the ball is stopping before reaching your attacking players so they dont get many playable balls youd have to wait for them to adapt to their new role or again tweak personal instructions to change how they move on the field  play wider cut towards the center and so on. Finally another scenario could be that they just have too low technique for a possession and passing game  youre playing as an Andorra division  team after all.

10035346,0,t1_dbflyyh,Thanks for your reply. I actually played a good portion of the season with a DLF on support duty upfront and changed it after my striker was unable to score. The same striker who scored  goals the season before with the same tactics.I will try playing with a BWM but I was always hesitant to change my defensive layout because my defense was the only thing keeping my team competitive and I was scared that with a more pressing DM it would open up space for the enemies.Was even thinking it could have something to do with the amount of loan players currently at the club. Usually in my starting eleven there are  players on loan and I thought they might not be really invested in the club plus they are all  years old.Edit You said DM not BWM sorry my bad,footballmanagergames,dbfmrls,2,t5_2s0w5

Hope for a takeover or steady income that can allow you to sign a lot of top youngsters and keep playing them together to build a quality side.

10357298,0,t1_dchvs8o,gt But usually when Im playing fifa with friends I keep on bragging about how bad fifa is compared to fm.dont do that with other people. seriously the majority just wants to play the most immersive football game without extra depth to it. for me it depends on my mood. lots of people likes football but most of them have average interest in it and youll only come off as annoying if you keep downtalking it. if I came back from football with friends in real life for example or just watched an astonishing game in La Liga my mind tells me FIFA because I want to recreate more of what I just saw or did. I actually never feel the urge to turn on FM unless Im in mid season but when I do it takes me  games to become unhealthy addicted to it and then I suddenly played it for  hours straight.gt Also to note on that with FM you really need to build a team and tactic. With fifa career mode you can have a shit tier team but still easily crush the enemies with your fifa skills which doesnt appeal me at all.again its up to you how difficult you want to make it. start with Eibar on legendary and dont buy any players only use spanish players from your youth academy. That will make it challenging enough for most people to quit after max. one season.,footballmanagergames,dci26eg,6,t5_2s0w5
