945,0,t3_1u4k7q,Like uIggapoo said its got a brief summary of the plot but no real sense of the genre style or tone. Im guessing horror or supernatural along the lines of Carrie? Also whats the age bracket? Is this a paranormal YA? Or an adult horror with a teenage main character?Honestly the cover isnt great. It could be a lot slicker and more professionally designed improved font less cluttered with more negative space. And have more color especially if its geared towards a teen audience. Im not sure the title is particularly stand out either. Sorry if thats frustrating to hear. None of these things are about the quality of the writing all about packagingmarketing to the audience you want to go after.I can see theres paper back versions of this in addition to the ebook. Is this a selfpublished book or do you have a publisher and if so what are they doing to get your book out there and publicized? With  reviews it looks like no one really knows it exists. Do you have a street team or a publicist? Is anyone reviewing it? Oftentimes doing a couple weeks of a free downloads on your website can help either this book or say your last book in the gear up for the release of your new book. Or releasing the first few chapters of this one as a free ebook taster.Theres also the issue how social media savvy you are and how comfortable you are with pushing your book online. Not to familyfriends they dont count and shouldnt be relied upon to boost your numbers but building your online fan base of readers. There are social media platforms specifically for writers and books like goodreads and wattpad for example.,YAwriters,ceejo41,5,t5_2vtil
37853,0,t1_ceiprgb,I think the biggest thing is that I was a little more sheltered growing up. It was conservative small town America surrounded by other conservative small towns and so the most diversity I tended to experience on any given day was did you live on a farm and are your parents still together? I suspect that had I lived closer to where I do now Id have had a few more experiences to give me a more accurate picture of the world.We also didnt and still dont in that area have easy access to specialty retailers like Best Buy or Staples. The largest town nearby was  people if you cant find it at WalMart or a local business  you have to drive a few hours to the k population town. And maybe call ahead just to make sure they have what youre looking for. The Internet helps with that some now but what choices for what you can shop for where you can eat and how you can have fun area really limited.The flipside of this is that local culture and local business were celebrated a lot more in large part because it was all we had.I dont know if this is endemic to small towns everywhere or just small towns in a very rural area but a lot of people I grew up with left the area altogether with the exception of the family farmers. There arent a lot of really wellpaying jobs outside of the oilfields and medicine and so theres not even a sense of I can just commute to work unless you were lucky or going into a specialty field.,YAwriters,ceiqocr,5,t5_2vtil

280370,0,t1_cf9t4uo,Its a complex nuanced issue but Kelly Jenson actually did a two part analytical post recently that scratched the surfaceEssentially its a part of the conversation on how the literary establishment favors male authors and in many cases and by extension stories featuring male protagonists and this in turn affects sales which feeds into reputation... and its a vicious cycle where the laudedbestselling YA authors are all upper middle class white men. Its the YA realms extension of what Jennifer Weiner has been talking about for several years re adult fiction. The establishment overwhelmingly reviewsfavorsheaps praise on books by men. Weiner has specifically called out the way the NYT reviews booksRelated to this generally there has been a LOT of talk about how John Green is saving YA... and we women writers and the readers of allllllll the YA by women are like what? Note were all also like we like John Green! But WTF is going on?!?! Its both about him and not about him at all but what he represents and reflects.

489283,0,t3_1zq37l,For AuthorsAuthor Lindsay Leavitt introduced me to Prezi.com and its something that I use almost exclusively for school and library visits. Basically its like an animated Power Point but rather than boring slides it zooms in and out of things. Kids seem to like them because theyre not the same boring slide show and I like them because they help me stay on track and add something for the kids to look at other than me. Heres the Prezi I use for most visits a generic sort of introduction to myself  inspirational speech. It probably doesnt make much sense without the context of my speech but actually thats a good thingIm a believer that whats on the screen should compliment the speech not be a wordforword rehash of it. So its mostly pictures that go along with what Im talking about. For Schools amp LibrariesIts such a juggle for me to get to the schools and libraries that want me to come. Typically it takes at least  days out of my writing scheduleone day to preparego over notes one day to do the event and one day to recover from the travelevent. I know that sounds like a lot but the truth of the matter is a couplehour event typically does take up far more of my time than just those few hours even with a close location and a practiced speech. Skype visits take far less time but even a short Skype visit will monopolize my entire day. So I have come to the conclusion that I have to charge for eventsbut there are definite ways around that. Here are some things that would make me want to come to the school from the start A promised honorarium for travel. I know funds are tight and I hate bringing up money as much as you do but if you let me know up front about what funds are available Id be much more comfortable saying yes or no.  Your first communication should be a scheduled datetime if youre uncertain at least give some perimeters upfront discussion about funds even without funds there are situations where Id attend and notice of the size of the classroom. Some classroom visits are ten kids. Some are . Ive been to both and at both the teacher called it a classroom visit.  Working with a bookstore. If you actively sell the book from the start Ill make more of an effort to get there. That sounds horribly mercenary but keep in mind that my job is to ultimately sell books. If you do advance sales and can promise me sales in about the same range as Id request for an honorarium then you dont have to pay meyouve paid me through sales.  Doing group events. You guys would NOT BELIEVE how much easier it is to get five authors rather than one. SERIOUSLY. Dude if you tell me I can do a group QampA with other authors I am THERE. Its so much easier on my part and I enjoy working with other authors and the whole thing becomes much less stressful. SERIOUSLY.  Work with bookstores! A lot of stores will do an onlocation event bringing books to the schools. They take care of all the money and most will give the school a cut of the profits such as . Everyone wins the author gets sales the store gets sales the school gets a visit and students get autographed books. The most successful schoollibrary events are the ones where      The teacherlibrarian has a clear plan of what they want more than just an author visit. Example a focused topic of conversation for a panel discussion.       The tl has already set aside a datetime preferably months in advance so theres not the added hassle of scheduling.       The tl targets a handful of specific authors inviting them to the event with specific reasons why you want that specific author as opposed to just a random published author      The tl works with a bookstore for sales. Doing something like the above turns the event into something far larger but honestly not that much more work. Ive set these things up as both a teacher and an author and it takes an afternoon of emailing to set it up. And that is the sort of thing thats really best for everyone. Kids will remember a larger eventit will stick with them and be something thats not just a guest speaker but a large event. Youll get on the bookstores radar so when they have author events they can funnel the authors to your school for future visits. And the author knows up front that the event will be profitable and fun. ,YAwriters,cfvvvcn,4,t5_2vtil

1242334,0,t1_ci9davl,No apologies necessary! I am here to answer questions after all. I queried  novels before RELAX which was my th book. I did not query all  thank goodness I at least had the sense to attempt revision in between though I was pretty horrible at revising.. I didnt get very close with my other novels. My first time querying I actually only queried  agents got so scared and realized the book wasnt very good and quit after that. With my second query attempt I got to  and had one request in all of that. My third novel I got to almost... queries. I had I think  requests in the bunch. I never got a request for a full MS off of a partial so I wouldnt say I ever got close to an offer.. I mentioned my stats a above so I guess I remember fairly well even after all these years Ive had an agent since  though Ive had three in that time period my previous two left the business. And well if you do the math my stats were pretty bad. I was a sad case of querying before I actually knew how to write and revise a novel. I think I had good ideas but was too eager and always jumping the gun. With RELAX I actually only queried like  agents and I had  requests not so bad before who would be my agent asked if we could work exclusively on a very in depth revision. I liked what he had to say so I decided to do that. We worked six months on the book before he officially offered another three before that due to a contest I won. I still credit him with teaching me how to actually edit a book because before then I was flailing around with little success. So moral of the story I guess is at least I improved each time? I think thats whats important. I wouldnt say you have to be perfect going into querying though wouldnt that be nice? but actively trying to improve is a big lesson I learned in the query trenches.,YAwriters,ci9dmmh,3,t5_2vtil

1360794,0,t3_29dug6,The YA sections of the bookshops I frequent are nauseatingly girly. Im immediately hit by dozens of books with femaleoriented covers  silhouettes of girls in dresses images of pretty girls images of young men with their shirts open showing off their chests ala MillsandBoon...Its not appealing to young boys its just not. The covers themselves often conjure up images of romance sappiness and One Tree Hill levels of emotional drama. Perhaps the content of those books is great. But you wont get these young boys past those terrible covers. First impressions are everything with books.Sometimes in their rush to appeal to the female reader base publishers forget about the boys. No selfrespecting boy will buy that angelsanddemons trilogy if all the covers have hunky men on the front. And dont give me that were in the st century we dont need to conform to gender stereotypes nonsense. Be realistic. You know Im right to some degree. I definitely think that the way books are marketed is a big problem. They are the ones that push boys towards boy books and girls towards girl books.In terms of should boys read boys... Im gonna be controversial again and say that I do think theres a difference between the type of books boys and girls like. Its a bit like the classic boyfriendgirlfriend problem  she wants to watch a romcom he wants to watch an action movie. I definitely think that boys are more drawn to physical actionoriented books as opposed to ones that focus more on emotional drama. I dont think it matters about the gender of the protagonist that much though I think people naturally gravitate a little to their own gender  the Hunger Games Katniss was a popular protagonist after all. She was less about feelings more about action  The Hunger Games themselves were boyreader heaven. So of course boys and girls should both read a mix of books. I dont think protagonist gender is a dividing line but I do think we should be aware that some boys probably prefer a different type of book than girls.

But I shall let you have at it! The sea surrounded him. His gaze was drawn out into the hypnotic swell and surge of emerald. It mixed with the smudges across the sky and the boughs of the clouds. Hanging grey swirled and the emerald curves clawed up. Everything shifted together in a menagerie of cold wet colours. Lao tried to look away from the tearing rising and falling of the ocean and sky but he couldnt. He was transfixed. Something moved up beside him but Lao could still not take his eyes from the horizons. The blurred shape started to hum next to him and despite the proximity Lao could barely hear the noise over the roaring call of the foaming waves. But the humming persisted and it seemed to grow louder drowning the sound of the sea. Lao shook his head to clear it and turned to the figure beside him. Abbott? The long arms of the sloth were draped over a walking cane and he beamed with his characteristic grin. What are you doing out here?The sloth continued to hum and tapped his cane on the rocky ground. It was tuneless and without rhythm but the abbot seemed to be enjoying himself. Reaching some sort of crescendo in his strange song he lifted his arms to embrace the horizon and with a flourishing gesture signalled the end of his symphony. Humming.Before Lao could try and get a straight answer out of the little furry creature the arms began waving again and another song came belting out. This one lacked just as much of a tune as the last and elicited even greater gesticulations. But Lao raised his voice to cut across the humming swirl that was the Abbot why are you out here?Long arms slowly retreated and rested back on the tip of the walking stick. Hui looked at Lao with his cool shining eyes. Well we shall start with bringing you back shall we? Something small fell out from Laos belly as his mind whirled around the possibilities of what Hui had said. Had something happened to Akiko? Was Clamshell okay? He opened his mouth but Hui cut him off again waving one of his long clawed hands in Laos direction. No no. To bring you back to the here and now. Theres only one reason a person gets a thousand yard stare in their eyes and then keeps looking.A chill ran up Laos spine. He knew what the old sloth was talking about. Those moments when he wasnt sure if he was standing on the shore of the waves the brief sensation of standing at the bottom of the ocean or his mind spreading and showing him glimpses of illuminated fish swimming through utter blackness alongside the visions of whales floating through cerulean. Neither the thief the priest or the monk Laos power came from the ocean itself and he was risking losing himself to it. ,YAwriters,ck3ozsy,1,t5_2vtil
1958658,0,t1_ckp7kf6,I think its less about the quantity of adaptations than the financial success and cultural penetration of them. Twilight The Hunger Games and The Fault in Our Stars just annihilates anything else YAwise. Female protagonist YA adaptations dont really have much competition in the box office whereas something aimed at the male audience is competing with Marvel and Michael Bay.What really will be interesting is to see how Paper Towns is received. TFioS is the only John Green book with a female protagonist so itll be interesting to see the reception of Paper Towns and his other books if they get adapted. ,YAwriters,ckp7y6p,3,t5_2vtil

This means that you will have to prepare the book for print and eBook to be delivered to bloggersbooktubers and allow time for them to respond with their critiques. This gives you the chance to finetune the final release version so that you can offer a high quality bookBut in many cases there can be a three month wait just to get signups and then another month and a half after that for the actual tourreviews to go live especially if you a re booking through a popular site. I think that if you have book two ready you should consider getting it out as an ARC to reviewers which in turn will build hype for book two and generate awareness for book one ya dig?Also it is a really great idea as mentioned already mentioned to use teasers for book two to promote book one.

3243162,0,t3_2x8cw1,Dear AgentDARK IN NATURE is an word YA postapocalyptic where the metaphysical meets evolution.Seventeenyearold Zoe survived the thhour of a worldwide epidemic only to become prisoner to a young pirate captain. But surviving is overrated as Zoe is force to live with little provisions haunting memories of her familys demise and zero freedom. The sea is a safe haven from the general population who have become hosts for an unstoppable virus and the shinigamideath godsrising from the earth every night hunting stragglers of the human race. Still a prison is a prison.Somewhere onshore is the key to removing her tracking device implanted by the pirate Sam to keep her tethered to his ship. When the ship is attacked and Zoe left behind her threeseconds of liberation is interrupted by her trackers selfdestruct activating. If she wants to live she must get back in range of the vessel she so desperately wants to abandon. Venturing through a ruined city the only thing she has going for her is the paininducing tug of the tracker letting her know shes heading in the right direction. When the tracker fizzles out and she still feels that pull Zoe discovers shes tied to Sam in a much more complicated way. During the epidemic a spike in evolution occurred tying of two people together as soulmates for species survival. She presses on to reunite with Sam as their separation means death but even if she succeeds her survival will be shortlived if they dont work together to find a way to return the legion of shinigami monsters back to their world before the human race becomes extinct.Thank you for your time and consideration.FIRST PAGEOld bones held the scent of rotted seashells. I tried not to gag as I searched the Playa Fluff n Fold. I should be indifferent to these abandoned nooks. Every town city island it was the same story. The Pestilence had equaled fever alteration deathrinse and repeat.My boots sank in rubble mounds of disintegrated building material mixed in with the remains of the people whod once lived in this beach city. I shook out my hair certain their dried flesh and tissue flakes had embedded themselves in my strands. Every moment I spent salvaging made me care a little less for all those who were gone. After all theyd gotten a kick in the ass through lifes door the one marked Easy Way Out.And I was still here.I hadnt been infected. I hadnt come forward. Id stayed in my house with my family. And watched them turn.Relying on my flashlight I avoided cobwebs as I checked the dryers. Found a full one and yanked clothes out hitting them against the machine. Stirredup dust gathered in the back of my throat as I kept digging. There. A few Tshirts and bras a perfect fit for my friend Cinder and me. Everything here had been washed two years ago but hey it was cleaner than what most of us wore. I shoved what might be useful for the crew into my backpack and followed a path of broken tiles. My stomach growled. I inspected a vending machine on the way out but it had been picked clean. Outside car husks frames flaking with rust sat in the parking lot. All where Id left themnot a shredded tire or dandelion clump out of place. Forever Fog layered the area bitterness of ozone and hot currents underneath. An eastern storm. Headed this way. Id be long gone before it arrived. As I made my way over broken concrete I jumped at every sound that wasnt minetrash scraps rolling along the ground in the shapes of giant insect carapaces and erratic chirps of crickets that inhabited the old shopping center. I hadnt been prepared for muggy weather when I left The Locket. The slick interior of my bomber jacket stuck to my skin overheating me but I kept it on. My bag only had room for loot. Boots crunching over glass from an empty window frame I left behind the charcoal dampness of the witching hours. The pet store turned out to be a drain on my light but the disarray of shelving didnt disappoint and the battery usage was worth it. I grabbed dog treats the fancy bakerylooking kindsealed ones not ravaged by mealworms or mold. The crew had stopped fussing over eating pet food a while back. I passed on bags of dry food and instead snatched multivitamins. I left the fish oil and all its omega goodness on the shelves. With nothing more than expiration dates to go off of I had no idea if the oil was manufactured before or after contamination. The last items I snagged were a few cans of cat foodany more than that would weigh me down on this run. ,YAwriters,coy5tk7,1,t5_2vtil

Strangely enough the third character is actually the most rational of all the characters and though her proposal seems like a joke the male characters in the book who are all examples of how men screw up society all make her idea seem both logical and necessary.

Reading curses in the context of the book is one thing and perfectly comfortable for most agents but reading cursing in a query which is a type of treatment or cover letter is really jarring and aggressive. I also agree ratchet is way to hip and culturally specific and appropriated to be appropriate for a query. Similarly would not use something like fleek. Only a fraction of your lets be honest white middleclass  something lady agents will know what youre talking about and itll pull them out. If Im reading between the lines properly my guess is that youre saying Iris might be a black girl kinky hair ratchet and in that case its both too coded and likely too offensive if people catch the code. Ratchet is NOT a compliment and best used as a selflabel. The more general note is that Iris the girl in question sounds interesting in personality and like she pushes back in a fun way and I get a bit of the setup but the general shape of the actual novel and plot seems unclear and generic.

3774246,0,t3_33mhnx,My personal tip for pushing through a draft is to find someone to write for. Not only will they hold you accountable with a hey get any more done in the book??? text every once in a while but they might also motivate you to keep going since its no longer just you invested in the project. For me this person is my alpha reader a close friend who immediately latched on to my story and begged for moreand since I knew she was going through a shit time in her life I found myself writing chapters just so I could give her something to cheer her up.If you want to finish avoid getting yourself down in the dumps or comparing yourselves to other writers. Money isnt important. I mean it is and you need it to pay the bills and live comfortably and stuff but if its the reason youre writing youre writing for the wrong reason. Remember that you have a story to share and theres a reason you one day decided to sit down and put pen to paper or finger to key or whatever. Comparing yourself to the success of others does not serve you at allif anything it will hinder you. Youll sit there like a stupid whiny loser going Oh but how will I ever write like Our Lord and Savior Ernest Hemingway? Youre making up bullshit excuses to get out of doing work. Youre not going to write like Hemingway but who the hell cares? Focus on your story and your characters. Another thingdont agonize over finding the perfect word or wording in the first draft. You can always go back and fix stuff later. Its much easier to make edits and improvements when you actually have something to edit though.When I get super stuck I just try to go out into the world and consume media. Unfortunately I cant think of a more romantic wording for it but as helpful as reading is there are other ways that stories are being told in the worldmovies video games what have you and those are sometimes just as good as books. Words are important but story elements are more importantthats why books with totally shitting writing like the infamous Twilight can become popularsomething about the story or the characters speaks to people gets them interested. Thats what youre looking for. Replaying an old favorite or checking out something new on Netflix can sometimes give me exactly what I need to get the wheels turning again. Steal like an artist. If you have no idea what that means look it up.As far as endings go. . .I like to write mine closer to the beginning of the project because boom there its done goodnow all I have to do is fill in the spaces between beginning and end. Itll change a ton by the time you actually get there of course and thats goodif it doesnt youre probably going about this all wrong because the story should dictate the ending the ending should not force the story to fit into its mold. Its good to have a general idea though because the longer you let it cook the better itll be and the more ways you can work in foreshadowing and other jazz.With respect to revisionsa first draft should never be seen by a set of human eyes other than your own. Ever. And when I say a first draft I mean whatever words you manage to shit out onto a page first. Its going to suck and it should because you have now produced the hunk of clay from which you will shape your actual story. Everyone is allowed a shitty rough draft or SRD and its an important part of writing. My personal process is as follows  . Come up with an idea. Let it cook for a few weeks let myself be influenced by other works think about what makes my favorite stories so great and how I might apply those same strengths to my own characters and world. . Scribble down notes that no other human being will understand perfect no one will know what Im doing until this is fit to be seen by other humans. . Take to the keyboard and produce the aforementioned SRD. Just get it all out. Yknow. Applaud myself for doing the bare minimum of my own expectations and head to the bars for a round depending on age and national origin results may vary . Let the writing cook for a few days go back to it cringe heavily and make edits linebyline. Think about how to say what Im actually trying to say this is the hard part. Read everything aloud to myself to make sure it doesnt sound like a moron wrote it. . Send to alpha reader spend rest of day consumed by anxiety. Hear feedback ask questions about impressions and predictions important to know if youre doing your job correctly. . Continue until youre about halfway through then go back and reevaluate what youve done so far. Is everything working the way you want? Hows your plot? Your pacing? If everything is still good repeat steps  until youre just about to the end rereevaluate then charge through to the end. Once youre there you can start making some real cuts and edits and be really mean to the work but the important thing is to get a finished draft. So uh I think that about covers it except for the cheerleading so here goes You can do it. You can do the thing! I wrote an entire novel and it was painful to get through at times but I got there and now I have expanded from one alpha reader to a fleet of betas who all believe in me and life is the greatest and my selfconfidence is just about to the point where Im ready to throw it out to the literal shark pit that is traditional publishing and all of this can be yours if you JUST.

4047896,0,t1_crhok4d,Yeah the health insurance was definitely a shock.  But it would have been way worse before Obamacare.  I know that with my job even though my contribution was only month the plan cost about  a month and I had a  deductible.  With the plan through the ACA I pay  per month with no tax credits and I have a  deductible with really low copays.  I dont got to the doctor often but I have my ADHD doc every month and two prescriptions.  On my old plan I had a  copay and my meds cost . My new plan has a  copay and my meds are .

4226368,0,t3_39be55,Dear Ms. FerraraIn the undercity slums of her home planet seventeenyearold Tayel and her childhood friend Jace dash to find help after spotting a dreaded Sinosian raider. They are far too late to call the alarm. Hundreds of dark aether portals materialize to unleash a fullscale raider invasion and they barely escape.A ship takes them to a neighboring planet where they await their surviving families but after refugee shuttles stop coming Tayel plans to go find them herself. Plan or no government officials wont let anyone leave. Her pleas to depart attract the attention of Shy a woman who divulges that the planet is controlled by an ancient race of dark aetherwielding aliens bent on enslaving the system. Theyre the ones keeping people planetbound and the raiders are merely the unknowing pawns driving everyone into the refugee camps. Shes equally desperate to break free so if Tayel and Jace help steal fuel from the shuttle docks she will fly them out on her hidden ship. Tayel accepts. Distrustful of Shy and upset Tayel would go along with an illegal plan without proof Jace storms off. Hes abducted by shadowed figures who subdue him with dark aether. Shy knows where hes been taken. Shell help rescue him if Tayel still agrees to pilfer fuel and maybe a shuttle part or two  for the added trouble. But when Tayel sees the raider emblem on Shys ship Shy is forced to reveal herself  as the leader of the Sinosian raiders  the same ones who invaded Tayels homeworld and drove everyone here in the first place. With the truth in the open Tayel doesnt know what to believe or who to trust. If she cant put aside her hateful distrust and work with Shy she risks losing the only part of home she has left  Jace  to the shadowy unknown.Complete at  words OVERSHADOWED is a Young Adult Science Fiction space opera with series potential. It would appeal to fans of Tammy Salyers Contract of Defiance Rachel Bachs Fortune Pawn and anyone who ever loved a good spacefaring adventure.While I dont have personal experience with ancient aliens or lasergunfights I am an active member of the Scribophile writing community have a Bachelors in Creative Writing and have multiple publications in short speculative fiction. As you mentioned being LGBTQ friendly in your bio Id also like to mention that my novel features a lesbian protagonist with a lighthanded romantic subplot.Thank you for your time and consideration.Sample PageTayel hurried through the undercity smog her gas mask rattling with every breath. She smacked the filter cartridge but the centimeterwide hole in the tubing still hissed as she inhaled. Stupid thing. Pollution burned the back of her throat. She coughed and Jace  huffing and puffing  sped up to reach her side. He grabbed the loose fabric of her jacket and pulled her forward. Together they rounded the corner where the neon sign over the grocers mart flickered dispersing light through the haze. One more block to Ottos. Pick up the pace.Bustling city denizens fresh off the afterwork tram slowed them on the main street. The cacophony of rasping gas masks drowned out Tayels leak and pounding pulse. She gagged at the sour taste along her tongue. Nothing mattered more than the hope of fresh air. Fresh air and safety.Two more shops down  and there it was. Neon tubing spelled out OTTOs in crooked letters above the shop washing Tayels arm in green light as she reached for the door. She pushed inside holding it open only long enough for Jace to hurry in after her.She steadied herself while the door shed come from and the door ahead clicked. A sharp sucking sound gave way to a rush of wind as the airlock triggered. She tore off the mask freeing her dull red hair to fall in sticky waves around her face. Against the opposite wall Jace removed his own mask and smoothed his ruffled head feathers down with his talons. ,YAwriters,cs1zed1,1,t5_2vtil
4231983,0,t3_39be55,Dear Ms. FerraraMeori Koday has never harnessed the power of magical cards battled ancient evil or been insulted by talking shrubbery. All Meori knows is a stagnant life in a city where even her best friend doesnt have a sense of adventure. When forces from another realm seek her for their own purposes Meori is pulled into a new world of magic and ancient power. Meori quickly discovers that she is more of city girl than she thought and begins a singleminded quest to return to home. After she befriends two renowned warriors known as the Tornado Twins and a selfabsorbed town boy she discovers four magic cards  Fire Water Earth and Wind  which react to her presence by unleashing their power. While activating the cards Meori accidentally unleashes an evil spirit set on world domination. With her life now in danger Meori must consult the Elites a secret organization that exist on the edges of everyday life. In exchange for helping her return home the Elites request that Meori gather all nine magical cards and defeat the ancient evil that she has unleashed upon the world. These nine cards will reveal the reason why she has been brought to this world and unlock secrets about her life that she could have never imagined. Knowing the truth she must choose whether to return to her own world or remain in this realm of excitement and danger. SECRETS OF THE ELITES MEORI is a Middle Grade novel of  words. It tells the story of a childish girls misadventures when she gets what shes been longing for. Set against the backdrop of magic secretive Elites vengeful souls and ancient evil it explores the fallacy in the comfort of feeling at home and the need for self reliance all linked by magical cards that show Meori the way to becoming the master of her own fate.First  PrologueAs a flash of light vanished the man growled and clenched his fists. How long had he been working on this project? Weeks? Months? It seemed like ages to him. A carrier pigeon landed on the window sill with a rolled up document. He snatched it from the bird making it dart away from him with a shriek. He scowled at its retreat for a moment before unrolling the page. His eyes scanned the page muttering we demand you report to us immediately. Crumpling the note he threw it over his shoulder where it landed with the other documents containing the same message.Design test fail modify retest he muttered. His mantra. He had yet to make a breakthrough. He scribbled down some notes repositioned the black book on the table in front of him and threw a handful of salt away from it chanting a few muddled words. Pale green light sprung forth in the centre of the room. It hovered in a ball shape before exploding into tendrils that converged at the centre of his set up. The light made contact with the book and he let out a triumphant cry. His victory was short lived as the light faded as quickly as it had come. It had barely touched the book before the spell had been broken and magical light disappeared. Grumbling to himself he repositioned the book thickened the chalk lines on the floor and tried again.,YAwriters,cs2mqyq,1,t5_2vtil
4242025,0,t1_cs3mdip,Both. A lot of it is true. A lot of it has been exaggerated. Probably the biggest exaggeration Ive seen that just wont die is that The Mortal Instruments was plagiarized from Cassies Draco Trilogy ie that her original YA was a filing off the serial numbers case. It just wasnt. There is one specific scene that yeah was in the Draco Trilogy and Jace is absolutely  her Draco standin... but thats tropes for you. I also think an author has every right to repurpose something original they wrote from one thing to another. The scene in questioncharacter backstory was  her original creation. I may be guilty of carrying over some of my fanfic tropes... just no one is going to notice bc I wasnt famous!But a lot of the drama that happened that youve likely heard about absolutely did happen. Clare was the head of a major HP fandom fanfic clique and she was a strong personality force to be reckoned with. Ive found that fandom attracts big personalities especially intelligent creative intense women raises hand... so you can imagine what it was like to have a bunch of strong smart creative women butting heads. There were falling outs and some public shade thrown and hurt feelings. however there are a few stories of Cassie bullying fans and from what I know those instances are totally false I actually wasnt directly present for most of the juiciest drama but I became friends with and am still friends with  people who were in Cassies inner circle. In fact theres stuff I cant say because it was told to me in confidence. But the way I see Cassie she was youngin her midsshe was very popular and that shit can go to your head. She was basically fandoms Regina George... not perfect did some stupid shit but didnt deserve to get hit with a bus if you know what I mean What I do know the plagiarism in the fanfic did happen. However the using Buffy quotes unattributed is plagiarism that I call bullshit on. It was the early days of Internet fandom and Clare would put in little Buffy Easter eggs for people to find. Now the book passages she lifted and put in? Bad form Cassie! and she got caught and boy has she paid the price in terms of it following her forever. Shes rightfully a bit bitter at how mean HP fandom people still are to herShe had a major falling out with Aja and a lot of the dramagossip there is true. You can actually Google to find Ajas account of what happened on her LJ. Id say the reality of what happened is something like what she wrote... its a pretty evenhanded account. And I personally still think Laptop Gate was SUPER tacky I was around for that but thats my personal opinion. Personally Im proud to see how far shes gone and I think its great to see an HP fandomfanfic person do so well. I dont begrudge her her success like some people and I think her YA career shows how creative smart and hardworking she is. She doesnt deserve death threats surely. I think its actually sad how hard HP people are on her because of it she wont touch any HP fandom related thing with a  foot pole she has not EVER attended a Harry Potter con or event.,YAwriters,cs3s6pv,2,t5_2vtil

I guess my question is  how much before seeing the wagon are you going to start? One of the best pieces of advice Ive heard is start as late as possible. This section made it seem like youre going to go way back to the beginning way before he discovered the wagon. But then in the end you stated you could just start at the wagon. I think it depends on how much relevant info you have before the wagon. Does this need to be written out or could it be summarized? My suggestion would to have that little section as a little bit of a prologue and then go back and tell the whole story before the wagon at the wagon after the wagon if that fits. This little blurb makes me excited for whats to come and I specifically love the this is the story of how I discovered I was Merlin. ,YAwriters,csq83ks,1,t5_2vtil

The jokes are quite well done especially the moving carriage bit. I really like this overall though there are a couple of continuity concerns that bear looking into even if theyre not addressed here they may not have been addressed in your mind First of all how did Darcy get into Wonderland? How too did the narrator? How does the narrator produce the book out of nowhere? Does he have some sort of magical bag of holding or an extradimensional bookshelf or somesuch? Im a bit of a stickler for details apologiesMost importantly how will the last part impact the story if the fiction characters are stuck in perpetual pagespace where they cannot learn or grow?

I would want to know more about the heir especially since she seems like a major character. Is the heir the enemy or is the secret society the enemy for trying to take her off of her mission?

In a way it was an exercise in world building  all these different threadlines in a community finding each other and sometimes missing each other. I also love being able to look at characters through other characters POV which is something Im exploring again with the next two books in the Bone Street series. Mainly I would say have fun with it and follow each throughline to where it takes you allow them to unravel and see where they goes.

Thanks in advance!It was becoming more evident that the group had taken too long to arrive. Jhin Murphey sauntered over to a fallen wall as the evening salt breeze blew from the East. Exhausted from the near hopeless efforts of the day his eyes roared alive glistening in the early moonlight as he approached. The peculiar ripple in the air above the charred wall was indeed there.He quickened his pace the vibrations against his skin from the misshapen brand on his chest resonated with an unnatural hum deep into his ribcage. He pulled tight his ash and soot covered gloves took care to lift with his legs as he wrapped his peppered grip firm around the wall and hoisted the remnants of what looked like was someones kitchen wall. There it was. A color of such a tempered brilliance that danced and flickered off the surrounding rubble combinations of countless hues and shades that pushed and pulled in a dynamic symphony of visual artistry.  He collapsed onto his knees where he sat fixating on the glow. Hovering over the charred corpse the emanating light simultaneously drawing his gaze and pushing it away. The hum in his chest drowned the sounds of the breeze and the crash of waves on sand. His eyes watered as the pent up of frustration released into waves of trembling through his body in an even cadencein phase with the intermittent changes in light. The sight was haunting.,YAwriters,d0eam9a,1,t5_2vtil

Thank you in advance!!Though blades of grass prickled Ursolas snout like pins she did not move. A warm breeze touched the fur at her ears and lifted the leaves of surrounding birches. They were white skeletons begging her to get up and try as she hadnt in years. Try to scale the stone wall. Try to earn freedom. Try to find hope.After fifteen years there was no use in trying.The stone wall was only four feet highUrsola could easily see mountains to the eastbut more than stones kept her trapped. So instead of climbing or digging or screaming she lounged on a flowerstudded hillside among a sunnyscent array of dandelions and buttercups. She softly curled paws into warm familiar earth.For a bear the menagerie made a lovely home but for a woman trapped in a bears body it was hell.Ursola stretched her maw in a yawn as the newest prisoner a honey badger scratched at the duncolored wall. Flakes of dust fell beneath his outstretched claws and powdered his black and white fur.Theres no use Honey she said bored.He dug into the mortar anyway and pulled up. His body trembled as Ursolas jaw clenched in anticipation. He froze limbs stiff. Magic shocked the therian and tossed him down like a broken doll.,YAwriters,d0g1nd6,1,t5_2vtil

6789531,0,t3_48oqnk,There are a lot of issues going on in those articles. Its talking about the content of YA books the inclusiveness and diversity of YA books and also the tone of YA books. Its all wrapped up into one argument but parts of both articles do have some merit.I think diversity is important but theres a good and a bad way to achieve that diversity. Sometimes I feel like an author has gone to the Diversity PicknMix stand to select the plot points for their book which feels disingenuous to the points theyre trying to raise. I think diversity in books works best when you dont realise its there. I dont mean that in a hide it away way. I mean that its better to weave the diversity of characters into the fabric of the story without making it detract from that story. Thats what normalises these types of characters and makes them work. Throwing in token diversity and  occasionally peppering the text with a reference to said diversity is not real diversity. Not to me anyway.I do think the tone and content of many YA books has veered towards the serious which is an interesting point that was raised. For example the MG section of the bookstore has seen a surge in David Walliams books in the last couple of years. He really taps into the RoaldDahlesque whimsical humorous type of writing and young readers have really responded to it. I do sometimes look through the YA section and... its a bit negative and depressing. Lots of serious topics lots of reallife issues about family breakdowns mental illness sexuality problems and death. And Im not saying they dont have their place on the bookshelf. But... wheres the fun? Wheres the lighthearted adventure and nonsense? I think about myself when I was younger although I gravitated to the Fantasy section I dont think YA was really a definitive thing just then. I loved reading because it was an escape a way to explore different worlds and lives that could never be real. I wanted to read about characters I could empathise with. But mostly I wanted to dive into my own imagination fuelled by these books and have some fun. Im not sure if its as easy to find those lighthearted books anymore on the book shelves.,YAwriters,d0lvqua,3,t5_2vtil
6888069,0,t3_4a2c5e,Like George Lucas before her I think Rowling doesnt quite understand what her fans really want or what the good bits about Harry Potter were. The idea of a wider magical world is much easier and more alluring than actually writing the wider magical world.Pottermore highlights Rowlings worst attributes as a writer that arent apparent when mixed with her strengths. Pottermore didnt have to be bad though. Rowling easily has the resources to contract out to a researcher or historian to give her fact checks or write summaries for her to graft wizards to. Rowling desperately needs someone that can ask her Why is The United States named  years before it existed as a muggle political concept and she needs to be able to say Youre right I should give MACUSA a bonkers magic name like the wizengamot,YAwriters,d0x2vlt,3,t5_2vtil
6889525,0,t3_4a2c5e,Honestly I havent and wont read these new histories.  I want to keep the magic of HP the way I remember it.  But from all the articles Ive read about the histories it seems very much like Rowling thinks of the US the way most Americans think of Europe.  She seems to envision it as one unified country and doesnt realize that each state has a very different history and culture...hell there are massive cultural variations within many states.In the same way many Americans lump Europe together ignoring the vast cultural differences both between countries and within them Rowling seems to have done the same.  It also seems like shes tried to incorporate magic into American history without having a firm grasp on the nuances of American history.  Which is a real shame and definitely not what Id come to expect from Rowling.  ,YAwriters,d0x8twu,7,t5_2vtil

8116715,0,t3_4qczb3,Oh hoooooooooo I have SO much to say about this. SO MUCH. I have ranted about JKRs vision of magic in North America many many times on Twitter.. She gets history wrong.This more than anything offends me. As a Ravenclaw I AM PROUD OF BEING A RAVENCLAW lazy research is the worst sin an author can commit. Lets talk about how she claims the Magical Congress of the United States of America MACUSA was founded in ...before the United States of America was even a country. In  we were a loose collection of colonial settlements with chartersgrants from separate governments Britain we had charters from different monarchs too! Virginia in the South was from Elizabeth I the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the North was from James I the Netherlands France and Spain. Many of us were still British citizens until . To some extent I can forgive a racist white colonialist founding of magical America its not too far off from the actual founding of our country. But JKR doesnt even do it in a way that makes sense. For example one of the boys marries a Mexican witch. Hurrah for diversity? Except Mexico itself was a Spanish colony at that time didnt declare independence until  plus said Mexican witch has a Spanish surname. So...she would have been a Spanish witch. Also what is a Spanish colonist doing in New England? If she was an indigenous Mexican witch she would have been Toltec or Oaxacan which had their own languages.Also what on earth did the Nauset and Wampanoag think of this white lady setting up camp on their lands? Did they help her like Tisquantum Squanto helped the Pilgrims? The whole William the pukwudgie thing left a really bad taste in my mouth because it was playing the Squanto role for her with nary an actual Native human in sight. Also how convenient to have magical servitude! P.S. How on earth did William learn to speak English?. She gets our culture wrong.Lets start with the name Ilvermorny which is named after Isolt Sayres Irish cottage. Ever notice how the names of a lot of our states are you know Native American in origin? Like the name Massachusetts or Connecticut? Connecticut incidentally being initially founded by the Dutch like New York. Irish settlers to the US didnt come on charters they came as immigrants. The fact that theres a cottage in the woods of Western Massachusetts with the name Ilvermorny is weird also because we as Americans dont have a huge habit of naming our housesestates. Those of us who did were generally the marginally richer gentleman farmers of the South Thomas Jeffersons Monticello George Washingtons Mount Vernon etc. Who had estates because they had slaves. Which she glosses over entirely.Also castles? Why is Ilvermorny a castle? Who goes out into the wilderness and decides to build a castle? In the th century? Most of our grand architecture only dates back to the Georgian era. All of our castles arent real they were created in the th century by rich people who decided to recreate a faux medieval sort of feel.. She has a shaky grasp of geography.To be fair Ive discovered a lot of Europeans have no concept of the SCALE of the contiguous US. Okay so the Pukwudgie is a Wampanoag Northeast creature. But the Wampus cat is a Cherokee animal. The Cherokee lived in the Southeast several hundreds of miles away. The Horned Serpent is more common to the Cree in the Southeast and the Thunderbird is a sacred creature. Thats like me deciding to go to Ireland found a magic school and claim the Morrigan as a mascot. Wands are apparently made with Jackalope antlers...a creature that exists in the American Southwest. ????Why WOULD an American magic school even have a House system? Private boarding schools here dont really not even Exeter or Phillips. Also why do we only have ONE? Who pays for it? Is it federally funded? If its in Massachusetts does Massachusetts get a tax break? WE HAVE STATES JKR. YOU DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK.I could go on and on and on about this. Ugh. I hate it.

You can say it is but that doesnt make it true.I dont think crazies just up and decided to make a coordinated rating campaign over a single political opinion posted on twitter. She is a smart woman. She knew exactly who she was calling out and to get that kind of reaction must have taken some serious poking of the beehive.It would be patronizing to say that she didnt understand her opponent. I think she knew exactly what she was doing and thats what makes me skeptical of her intentions.gt The author singled no one out she threatened no one. She simply offered her opinion. You dont know that and neither to do I.What we do know is that she has been vocally politically active on twitter enough to rile up hundreds of people.gt telling people when they should and shouldnt speak out about issues for which they feel passionatelySpeak all you want. Speak till the cows come home but understand that actions have consequences. If you engage with crazy people expect crazy responses. That might not be what you want to hear but that is a fact of the world.

9233265,0,t1_d8mbzej,I typically keep up with them on their Twitter or Facebook author pages because I wont work with clients I dont like so if I work with them I like them! I dont mind at all that most of my clients are great with social media in fact I love that they are. I dont think social media sells any amount of books that would be relevant to a publisher but I do think it develops longterm relationships with fans and can create connections that may help my authors down the road. So I think its a very positive thing if it is something the author is able to balance and not something that drains them tremendously. If it is there are other ways to develop fan relationships and make industry connections. And LOL if I see a client livetweeting a Netflix binge when I know they have a deadline coming up fast I might see whats up but that has actually never happened. I and most other editors I know realize that our authors have lives and that many of us also ask them to maintain positive social media presences. Tweeting occasionally can give us an element of community support that can be helpful on deadline. But to some its just a major distraction so some of my clients like to go offline during revisions. So if its kept in balance and not a huge distraction I dont think it should be a problem at all!,YAwriters,d8mdtyl,4,t5_2vtil

9545531,0,t1_d9pn8ik,Thanks Natasha! . Oh man its so crazy right? When I started doing these audiobooks and I was told it was BerenSTAIN Bears I was like Huh thats funny. For all those years I thought it was Berenstein. Then I forgot about it and moved on with my life. But of course later I learned this is an actual THING. That it totally was Berenstein when I was a kid and somewhere along the timeline it mysteriously shifted to BerenSTAIN. WTF!! As a Jew I hate thinking that its an antisemitic shift meant to make the bears sound less Jewishy so I have to believe thats not the case. Which means...what? Some people have really elaborate alternate reality theories which I totally love that weve split into two worlds one with BerenSTEIN and one with BerenSTAIN. You know ultimately I just dont know Natasha. Truly one of lifes great mysteries. . Superstar writer! One thousand percent. Which is mindboggling to me that I would answer that way considering Id been dreaming of being an actor since I was  years old. But the fact of the matter is being an actor even a superstar actor is far too often an incredibly disempowering position to be in. Youre always waiting for someone to give you a role and then when they do it might be for material you dont believe that strongly in. Thats why most actors when they get to a certain status level all turn to producing so they actually have some control over what theyre going to be working on. I love writing because even when my career might not be going well at least Im the one generating the creative material whichhopefullyis material I really believe in even if Im doing a bad job writing it. . Ha! I mean I wish I had some weird answer. My most prominent writing habit is that Im undisciplined and usually dont ever get as much work done as I want to. I often listen to s music while I write. Is that weird? Not really. Oh! Im a big fan of index cards during the rewriting phase. So once I have a draft I love looking at the story arcs by writing an index card for every scene. Thats also not weird. Im sorry. Im bad at answering this question. ,YAwriters,d9pomr9,3,t5_2vtil

10426838,0,t1_dcpxfxt,First your stellar critique is a godsend. Thank you for taking the time. Youve touched on a lot of my own concerns like the geas and wacky sidekick thing. For the geas I felt it important to mention both the first and the second because I thought the first was important to understand the second but I think youre right in that I could take it out entirely. I did want to use it as a way to show a conflict between the Councils  they run the knights control and her independence did you find that it did so? And for the sidekick thing maybe I can just mention the group as a whole in vague terms and that would be enough to set up the bond. My first instinct was to highlight the other important characters but I was never really happy with how I did it. Do you have any advice on how much of the plot to reveal? I only cover the first quarter here but theres a twist at the middle Ive been considering adding to the synopsis.  This advice is great thanks again!,YAwriters,dcpy8lc,1,t5_2vtil

10853057,0,t1_ddze93h,Thats a great questionand its so hard to know the right answer.  The acquiring editor who bought the  trilogies labeled it as magical realism. I have a series that is timetravelish but not exactly. The other series has a genie who has magic with rules.  I went along with the editors decision to call them magical realism but Im not sure they meet the traditional definitionwhich implies that all main and secondary characters accept the magic. That isnt true for mine.So I just go with realistic fiction with magical elements that are integral to the main plot.If anyone has another definition please let us know!,YAwriters,ddzezj0,2,t5_2vtil

10907538,0,t1_de50jkn, The first paragraph definitely made me think the entire thing was Caseys idea. After reading it again its clearer that Ana wanted to go but now Im confused by why if the party is her idea did she have to be convinced to wear a dress? If Casey doesnt know what Anas up to why would wearing a minidress be so important? Why does Ana need to be wearing something shes clearly uncomfortable in unless its part of her plan in which case why would she have to be convinced? I think by starting with Caseys power of persuasion it gives the idea of Casey having convinced Ana of everything and making Casey the star and Ana a sidekick. Maybe somehow it could be made clearer that her persuasion skills are limited to fashion? Or start with Anas power of lying to her father then follow with Caseys? The third paragraph would naturally follow still... I read all sorts of books. I dont do a lot of fantasy type but I will on occasion. This so far kind of gives me an A.S.

Within the first . pages you introduce  different characters plus  of the characters are referred to with slightly altered names in different places Dasviri instead of Iri and Vanshmukh Tathanat instead of just Tathanat making it more like  new names. This is a lot to throw at a reader who is still trying to get a handle on the setting narrative style etc. This is doubly true because the names are not common English names that will be familiar to most readers.,YAwriters,df6thco,2,t5_2vtil
