10451942,0,t1_dcst0nh,I dont have an interest in marching because it ultimately wont lead to anything of significance besides feelings. And right now my I feelings arent hurt by not knowing someone elses income. Im also more thickskinned to not throw tantrums from losing an election. Boy I sure am I glad I didnt lose .b from a failed campaign Soros must be super pissed to fund all of these protests. Look all of these marches will lead to naught and only invoke more violence as witnessed last Friday. And as for the people not caring for the tax returns YES people who actually want help the country dont give two shits about the taxes as long as restoration is made. And I dont see how viewing President Trumps taxes will help heal the country. Again selfapplication to do something constructive for the country not yelling and wearing pussyhats on a work day.,taxmarch,dcsttib,-3,t5_3ipuu

10463607,0,t1_dct5857,cosignedYeah it would be best to have some MUCH clearer information on exactly who you are person who made this website and what you plan to do with the suspiciously personal information you are asking for.Website is asking for personal info and there is absolutely NOTHING about the organization asking for the collection of that information.As it stands it looks scammy as fuck intentions notwithstanding. Considering how shitty a whole lot of Trump supporters are and the bullshit underhanded techniques they like to use against their opponents this website looks shady.,taxmarch,dcu5mxc,2,t5_3ipuu
10471711,0,t3_5pyvsv,I like the sentiment but Tax March is so simple and even reminds you what day to march on. Its a straightforward easytounderstand demand yet is also a thing Trump can actually do. A March for Truth or something like that is really vague about its goals. But a tax march could also be about other things too. Its just good to have a concrete goal with an easytoremember date and a simple name that describes the purpose and what is being demanded. ,taxmarch,dcv2r39,3,t5_3ipuu

10778973,0,t1_ddrjcfm,Elected officials no way do teachers and cops deserve to have their financial information public record that creates sallary issues among coworkers and all kinds of bad things.,taxmarch,ddrru0s,15,t5_3ipuu
10780215,0,t1_ddrnez1,Before you go and call other people retards maybe you should actually look into the difference between a public employee and a public official.  Less than half of states in the US consider a public employee a public official and of those that do most only equate them if they are highlevel public employees. sourceSecondly stating that all politicians are corrupt is actually a good argument for public officials to release their tax information.  While a politicians tax returns may not illuminate all conflicts of interest it certainly is better than nothing.  All the politicians you mentioned Sanders Clinton Obama released their tax returns.  The fact that Trump refuses strongly implies that there is something in those records he wants hidden and that should be a concern for everyone especially in light of other accusations leveled against him.,taxmarch,ddrwfvo,3,t5_3ipuu

10985047,0,t1_decpphz,Invest your own money and take a business risk and employ thousands of Americans.  If youre successful you make a lot of money and pay a lot of taxes on those profits and Americans continue to be employed.  If youre unsuccessful you are legally and ethically deduct those losses from future earnings.  This is accounting .  Seems like most of reddit has no idea how business works...but that doesnt stop you guys from being righteous and have a loud ignorant opinion on the issue!,taxmarch,ded4bzw,1,t5_3ipuu
