3689065,0,t1_cqcc3d1,Wow it was insanely windy even down here on the urban corridor. Nice job making it up! How strong were the winds on the summit would you guess?,14ers,cqcs0kv,1,t5_2srvd
4263100,0,t3_32ic4w,I will add that when the ridge becomes more exposed near the summit the rock is very solid.  Its a great scramble though your friends may get sketched a few times if inexperienced.,14ers,cs6646s,2,t5_2srvd
4605772,0,t1_ctb18tq,That sounds kinda crappy... It was a great day Saturday. Glad we got back to the car before noon though there were some nasty clouds rolling in. The wind was only bad on Cameron. Probably  mph.,14ers,ctb55i7,1,t5_2srvd
5039096,0,t1_cu0nsu9,Ah but the best route up La Plata is in the valley on the south side which requires wd to get to. So much more beautiful than the other way.,14ers,cutehmx,1,t5_2srvd

7898896,0,t3_4ncjuz,I had a pretty easy time on Sherman around this time last year. Definitely some postholing but not really enough to need snowshoes. Watch out for cornices.,14ers,d43wrfk,1,t5_2srvd
8431881,0,t3_4udb5w,I dont know if Im late here but I strongly second the Elkhead Pass recommendation. Elkhead pass is slightly longer but MUCH gentler. And it allows you a view you wouldnt otherwise have.,14ers,d5vixwv,1,t5_2srvd
