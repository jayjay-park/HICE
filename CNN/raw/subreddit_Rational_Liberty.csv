2539121,0,t1_cmpzysc,ampampamp Paulville Texas sfw gtPaulville Texas is the name of an American cooperative organization as well as the site and planned community under its development in the salt flats of north Hudspeth County intended to consist exclusively of Ron Paul supporters.   The Paulville community idea was named after U.S. Congressman and  presidential candidate Ron Paul  and the utopian cooperative is modeled on his often libertarian ideas.   The New York Times says For now the town is little more than an idea and a title deed but considers it to be evidence that Pauls campaign appears to be growing into something beyond a conventional protest campaign  also echoing the concept expressed by others that the Ron Paul revolution has increasingly less to do with Ron Paul. gtgtImage i  One view of the local Guadalupe Mountains.Interesting List of intentional communities | End the Fed | Young Americans for Liberty | Ron Paul bibliography Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcmpzzef oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecmpzzef.

5500585,0,t1_cweq3ez,Yeah as soon as I saw the bestof link I started trying to remember what the Slate Star Codex links were and then I saw that was exactly what someone had posted in the Bestof comments. But I figured I would link everything here as well. As far as the specific fallacy I think Scott Alexander calls it the argument from privilege. He demonstrates the argument from how a person on the right might feel in Fearful Symmetry part V.
