9745781,0,t3_5epuqu,When I finished it I immediately thought that I had to wait a year or more for the next one. For me its a  situation. We wont have the  movies to marathon them and know the rest of the story in less than  years but at least we have new Harry Potter Universe material to look forward to. ,FantasticBeasts,daedok7,5,t5_31655

10962746,0,t1_da99j6n,I think thats the beginning of Grindelwalds obsession with obscuri. After he witnessed Arianas death and the destructive power of her obscurus Grindelwald is lured to the idea of harvesting power through suppressed magic in wizards and squibs. That is also the main reason for his breakup with Dumbledore since Albus is not willing to inflict pain in others just for the obtention of power. I also think there must be a connection between Newts research on obscuri and Dumbledores deluminator and maybe even Ariana.    ,FantasticBeasts,deaqaga,3,t5_31655
