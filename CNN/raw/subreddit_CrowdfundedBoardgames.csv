8423523,0,t3_4un5cs,Short answer Use KS not Patreon. Long answer Patreon is great for supporting artists and the like that are producing ongoing content. A game is a finite item even if you want to develop it further. I would back a game on KS because I know what I need to pay to get the game. On Patreon you are telling me I dont know how long this will take or how much it will cost so I want people to keep paying me monthly until I have it figured out. If you knew how long it would take and thus how much it would cost you could set up a KS page.Through KS you can offer a reward tier or tiers that give access to the PnP. So long story short if I saw a boardgame or even a video game dev using Patreon I would assume they dont have a plan and are jumping into funding WAY to early because Im paying you to dev a game not to produce.,CrowdfundedBoardgames,d5uhd55,1,t5_2upsq
10689859,0,t1_ddi94nt,Yeah that was one of my biggest assumptions. But the difference isnt all that much. Maybe more the perception. Or maybe no urgency to get it now so they can wait...Ill hope for the latter.  Do you think some sort of Valentines special would hurt?,CrowdfundedBoardgames,ddikw7l,1,t5_2upsq
10770302,0,t3_5tvb5e,Kickstarters are a ton of work. You need to get the word out to about x or x more people than you need to actually back you because not all the people you inform that you exist will actually give you money. And you need to start doing the work months before you start the project so your audience is primed and ready to actually act.,CrowdfundedBoardgames,ddqvkzl,2,t5_2upsq
