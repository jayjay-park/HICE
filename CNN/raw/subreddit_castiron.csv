1453581,0,t3_2assoa,If it were me Id strip them to bare metal clean thoroughly and reseason all of them there are SO many ways to do that but thats because I get my cast iron from unknown sources garage sales eBay etc. and I often dont know their history so I like to start fresh.If you know the source from which they came you may want to consider just freshening them up a bit. Most of them look like they could benefit from a good salt rub cleaning. Kosher salt a little tiny bit of water and a soft sponge or heavy duty paper towel is all you need to give them a good scrub. Rinse quickly dry thoroughly with paper towels and then to be sure its absolutely dry put it on a warm burner or in a  oven for  minutes. Once dry coat the warm skillet with a thin layer of oil and set aside until youre ready to cook on it.It appeared that one may have some light surface rust. If the salt rub doesnt take care of it you can use vinegar to get it off. I use it straight because Im always stripping pieces but others have used it diluted. Not sure the ratio... maybe someone else can chime in with additional information.,castiron,ciyhcga,3,t5_2s8x6

2192172,0,t1_clih6ro,I always end up with a bit of unavoidable damage to my cast iron when I use them to make chili or gumbo due to the extended boil time and the acidity.

2214062,0,t3_2kh68f,Just looks like the seasoning popped off in those spots.  If you are cooking on the next burner and you splash an adjacent cast iron skillet with watervinegarsomething acidic the spots can appear. Just keep cooking on it. After awhile the season builds up and recolors it black. Also the Lodge advice on temps sucks. They clearly dont want people to freak out over the smoke created by a good seasoning process so they recommend temps about  degrees lower than they should be. Sure it might dry out the oil but it doesnt polymerize completely and can be sticky and pull right off.Go to  if you want better results.,castiron,cll9e3h,5,t5_2s8x6

4850783,0,t3_3hbov3,In the summer humidity it will be hard to avoid this flash rust. Washing the pan in cold water then drying it with paper towels seems to help a lot. Then stick it in the oven to fully dry and heat for seasoning. If youve got a gas oven there will be water vapor inside so leave it open a crack as it heats up. But a thin layer of flash rust doesnt stop the seasoning. Just wipe your oil on as usual and the flash rust will wipe onto the clothpaper towel.,castiron,cu5z6rk,2,t5_2s8x6

5980981,0,t1_cy3kz08,Im guessing thats rust still on the section youre worried about.  And the easiest answer for that is more time in the electro tank.  Electro removes rust and it will also remove the initial seasoning youve done so far.  So I would give it another round of electrolysis and then scrub with steel wool or a brush like this.  Just make sure its stainless steel other metals like brass and copper can leave residue behind that you dont want.  And Id give it a decent scrub with the brush but dont kill yourself.  Rinse often and if its not coming clean in a few minutes go back and do more electro.  After that dry thoroughly and inspect to see if you see any rust remaining.  If theres no rust or if its just surface rust then go ahead and season and see how it turns out.,castiron,cy3mzeq,2,t5_2s8x6

6079257,0,t3_3ytl4x,This is my first cast iron piece so I have no idea what went wrong or how to fix it.When I first got the pan I briefly sanded the bottom mostly to remove the preseasoning and to smoothe the pan ever so slightly. I believe I used  grit then  . Whatever was lying around the house.Yesterday I tried to get a few layers of seasoning down. I used canola oil and did it on the barbecue parents didnt want too much smoke in the house.On the nd layer I noticed that the section in the middle of the pan doesnt seem to be seasoned. Its strange to me because its such a defined line not just a splotch in the middle. My guess would be that the unseasoned section may have been between the burners on the barbecue which would have heated the pan unevenly. With that in mind how should I move forward? Thanks guys! EDIT If its not clear from the picture Im referring to the light spot in the centre of the pan with a sharp defined edge on its left side. The paleness on the right of the image is just lighting. ,castiron,cygh2lq,1,t5_2s8x6
6095542,0,t3_3z12j1,I was worried about this as well before I got a lodge. The grittypebbly texture just seemed like it would cause problems. I had to use it for a long time to get a really nice layer on the bottom before I felt comfortable with fritatas and breads but you just have to up the oil a bit. Its fine but I would give it a couple months of regular saute use before you go crazy mostly because the stuckon food especially if it burns in will sit there in little pits and slowly come out until it gets seasoned over and locked in. ,castiron,cyii0vo,2,t5_2s8x6

6765912,0,t3_487nsk,The Flax Seed is what made the bottom look bronze. Its an ugly look.With that said I dont know why people are giving you so much shit down voting you.  You were forth coming and transparent about what you did giving us a glimpse of the result.  If you want peace I think the answer would be to get some powdered Lye from ACE hardware oh god be carefull with that stuff rule  fill the water before put it in not the other way around.  Put the pan in for  days Instead of dicking around let patience do all the work.  Then reseason it with crisco NOT flax seed oil.  I have my own theories of seasoning a pan Ill throw at you.  If you are going to go above the smoke point of the oilsay the oils smoke point is F stil take the time to season it at lower than .  Ill do mine at F for  min.  After awhile a certain odor will subside. Then turn up the oven a small notch and let it go over smoke point  degrees or so to F.  You will smell something and it will subside after awhile.  The theory is some seasoning elements happen just before smoke point and some after.  My understanding that the polymerization happens after passing the smoke point but others season theirs only at temps below smoke point.  I figure doing it how I said will get both worlds if there are two worlds.  Also I think its cleaner to burn away whatever is at F before burning away whatever is past smoke point.  Anyway god that was long  if you want that bronze color out you have to reseason without flaxseed oil.  Either that or just keep it how it is with the flaxseed.  It will continue to change color but will have that bronze color for a long time. Possibly forever I dont know. I have a pan that has that color.  Its ugly.Lastly when I get time Im going to sand down a lodge.  My angletheory is to use  grit the peaks were half way down  then do a quick polish with some  grit.  The objective would be to grind the bumps half way down or maybe rds of the way down so there are still half bumps.  The texture would be like a bunch of mountains with the top halves lopped off and leveled.  This I think would allow the spatula to slide nicely over the leveled tops  but there is still a lattice of valleys in between where the seasoning would hide.  I believe the hiding seasoning would be partially carbon buildup an insulator  opposed to a polymerized layer on the leveled tops which would be highly heat conductive and seasoned through polymerization.  Hotter tops means more sticking but all the top points are all surrounded with a web of nonstick carbon so it wouldnt be much work forsliding spatula hitting those exact spots.God I hope Im seeing the science correctly.Also I upvoted all your posts because if people can wantonly downvote you I can wantonly upvote you.

So Wagner Griswold BSR Wapak Vollrath CHF Favorite Lodge etc would matter to me but that assumes Im doing more than just using the pan.Realistically if Im looking just for personal use a vintage pan is better BUT not absolutely critical to the average user.  I think your question goes to condition. A vintage pan with a super smooth surface vs a rough import pan next to each other in the store...Id pay a bit more for the vintage pan.  That being said both pans will work fine.  Especially if someone just wants the experience of cooking with cast iron.  Good seasoning and care will equal a great pan no matter how poor the original casting is.As to the enameled pan....Usually on the helper handle opposite the main pan handle not all have this but a lot of Le Cruset do and in the bottom center will say Le Crueset and usually a number denoting centimeters in size.  . at a thrift store is a lot for a pan you cant adequately identify but its fun to take a chance.You can find them out there. I bought I Le Creuset round grill pan at a Goodwill last week for four bucks.  Its not chipped its dirty but thats fixable.  Goes for around a hundred new.  You can find them.

7629397,0,t1_d3899yf,Its not.  True its caustic and nothing to mess with but as long as youre careful.  Truly careful be mindful of spills and accidental exposure to people and animals.  Its no more dangerous than oven cleaner or drain cleaner  oh wait it IS drain cleaner.  Unless you have a septic system just pour it down the drain when youre finally done with it.  It lasts a long time.  If you have a septic system or really want to neutralize it mix it with a molecular equivalent of muriatic acid HCl and dump the resulting salt water anywhere...Or working backwards use the lye bath to neutralize the scary acid  Neutralization of an acid occurs when it is combined with a base to produce a salt and water. Muriatic acid consists of positively charged hydrogen ions and negatively charged chlorine ions. A basic liquid such as caustic soda sodium hydroxide consists of positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged hydroxyl ions. During the reaction the hydrogen and hydroxyl ions combine to form water while the chlorine and sodium ions combine to produce sodium chloride known as common salt.You can dilute both the acid and lye bath first to minimize the heat buildup.  Neutralization is an exothermic reaction.  Either calculate or get some pH test strips to know when your mixture is neutral pH near .  ,castiron,d39f6lf,1,t5_2s8x6

Ive had it for about  years and its getting there but there are a few things I do that I think help a lot. i agree that you need to heat the pan well first then put in the fat. Mine is a little  pan so I only use about a tablespoon of butter. Then I keep the pan moving shaking andor banging it the whole time so the egg doesnt have time to adhere. I cook rolled omelets in this pan all the time on very high heat  out of  on a conduction stove top but thats only for about  seconds french omelets are to be cooked superfast while scrambled eggs I do low and slow.

Im just saying that you can simply heat to your desired temperature rather than going beyond it and then backing down. The reason why your method works is that its a surefire bet that the pan is hot enough when you add food to it. Simply observing the state of the oil shimmering smoking using your hand to feel for temperature or using the water drop test are all other methods to check your temperature.

9248031,0,t3_570qvf,Theres some good advice already in here but I thought Id give my take on it...First try using crisco instead of vegetable oil. Ive had much better results with crisco less sticky more predictable. Like uJoethemofoe said Bake at   isnt hot enough in my experience for at least an hour. Then let it cool in the oven. Repeat this many times. Im a little crazy so I do it like  times on a fresh bare pan. Also dont overcoat it each time you want to literally wipe off all the excess oil before it goes in the oven. Even then youll want to pull it out after  mins to wipe off any oil that has begun to pool into little globs. Each time you take it out of the oven it should have a nice dry feel to it. And it will get a little darker and glossier each time you do it.Once youve laid a nice base of repeated oven seasonings start cooking with it but avoid anything acidic like tomato sauces that will eat away your seasoning foundation. For cleaning Lodge scrapers kick ass. They are super hard plastic that wont deteriorate but also wont damage your seasoning. If you have to scrub be gentle and use steel wool. Every few uses youll want to replenish the seasoning of the cooking surface on your stovetop. I find the method uHoardofPackrats linked to be great for this give it a coat heat it to the smoke point and wipe in a circular motion. Wipe all excess off and let it cool. Thats it.If for some reason that STILL doesnt work I would restart completely by spraying with oven cleaner and putting in a plastic bag overnight to strip it and then begin the seasoning process from scratch. I doubt this would be necessary at all but its always an option. Good luck!,castiron,d8o980q,5,t5_2s8x6

You could even use a wire brush lightly but try not to damage the seasoning.  Then give it a good scrub with kosher salt or a chainmail scrubber. Finally give a good scrub with a stiff nylon brush a drop of dish soap and the hottest water you can get from your tap. If it wipes clean and theres no exposed metal youre good to go. Give it a light coat of oil and dont worry about it. Plan on making some bacon soon.If however youre exposing gray metal then the seasoning is done and you might best strip it and start over.

That was  years ago.Its strange that flax would have problems since the double bonds in the fatty acids are the sites that allow the polymerization reaction to proceed and flaxseed oil has a very high degree of unsaturation.  There is a paper suggesting that more unsaturated fatty acids adsorb on FeO surfaces less well than saturated ones so maybe the issue is that flaxbased seasonings have more cohesive than adhesive strength.,castiron,dgsbuug,1,t5_2s8x6

11793690,0,t1_dgw4tty,Not OP but I make a lot of Dutch Babies.Best tricks Ive picked up WARM BATTER.  A Plan ahead and set out your eggs and milk early enough to reach room temp B Speed up that same process by using warm water or C mix up your batter and place THAT container in warm water. A lot Dutch Babies I see on here are beautiful around the edges but flat and very pancakelike in the center. Thats generally because the batter was too cold when poured. SATURATED BATTER. After mixing your batter together let it sit at least  minutes before baking for me at least  min before preheating the oven. This gives the flour a chance to be completely absorbed by the liquids which then allows for more rising and a fluffier baby like OPs. SHAKE IT. Not unlike a Polaroid picture. Personally I mix the batter and let it sit about  minutes in warm water. Then right before pouring into the pan I briefly hit it with the blender once more to eradicate any residual lumps and then I shake the hell out of it. This works a bunch of tiny air bubbles into the batter and helps gives it a fluffier finished texture more like a PopOver than a pancake. HOT OILBUTTER. I typically use Coconut Oil but the same rule applies all around make sure the oilbutter is hot enough before you pour. Personnally I preheat the oven with the pan inside. Once it hits temp I throw the oil in and close it back up. Then I have A COUPLE OF MINUTES to reblend and shake the warm batter. By the time Im done with that the oil is good to go. When you pour you should be able to hear the batter sizzle  if you add the batter and nothing really happens then your oilbutter wasnt quite hot yet.OPTIONAL ALMOND EXTRACT. This one comes down to personal taste but I swear by it. Every recipe Ive seen calls for Vanilla and thats because it works. Want to change it up? Keep a few drops of Vanilla but replace your normal measurement typically  to  tsp with Almond instead. Again this is all personal preference. MAGIC BULLET. Mine isnt actually that same brand but the Bella Cucina knockoff that does exactly the same thing. This rig is PERFECT for Dutch Babies. Its just the right size to mix everything in one small container which lends itself very well to A warming the mixed batter in water and B shaking it up right before the pour. Plus cleanup is super simple without having to wash a fullsize blender. This last tip obviously isnt as important as the rest because you can make a perfect Dutch Baby without a personalsize blender. That being said there are lots of different versions available nowadays for about  and I feel like the added convenience is well worth it.,castiron,dgwurw4,3,t5_2s8x6
