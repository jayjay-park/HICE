1661360,0,t1_cjok1uy,Well my thoughts on religion and such are a bit different than the norm. I used to be deistic before I fully formed my thoughts on the matter. Now I hold an agnostic position towards the idea of a god but not a super god. That is that if a god exists then that god must have been created by the same mechanism as a godless universe had been created. Which means theres no super god god that creates everything. Commonly described gods also are bound within the constraints of the universe making them unable to act outside of it which would be a logical contradiction. So that puts me as an atheist but Id still say there could be a god. Just like there could be a computer simulation we live in.As for ghostswerewolves they are simply fairytales. Just like vampires or anything else. However if you take my philosophy and thoughts about the universe to a logical extreme which I make sure its possible with my views then those things technically exist. Not in our universe but as the thought exists logically there must surely be a logical situation in which they exist. Which guarantees they exist in some form or another.But if you asked me Id simplify that to no they dont exist as the context is our universeplanet not the metaverse.Could be trolling could be legit. ISTPs from what I gather dont typically think about this stuff. The only reason I personally have is because it was my big question that no one would answer. So I set out to answer it for myself. Otherwise Id probably have stuck with a deistic stance.,mbti,cjokrwf,4,t5_2s90r

The JP in your type determines whether your judging or perceiving function in domaux pos is extroverted.So if you are an IxxP that means your dominant function is a judging function not a perceiving function.gtTrying to work on that and J matters like cleaning my room is like kicking a brick wallThats just a stereotype. Plenty of xxxPs keep their room clean and plenty of xxxJs keep their room messy.gt if not please help me understand Ps clear advantages over J because I cant see how this continuous physical and mental mess is beneficial.There is none. Same goes for Js over Ps. Because all it tells you is whether their domaux extroverted function is their judging function or perceiving function.

2052438,0,t1_cl0ornu,What would you accept as a reasonable argument? I think sundayblooms has put it quite well. The reality is that most celebrity type websites out there are not just inaccurate but can be  inaccurate.I actually do have a personal list of celebrity types here I believe it is significantly more accurate than celebritytypes. Of course its far from  accurate for a variety of reasons but I believe its a good list.I kind of dont advertise my list anywhere partly because its just too difficult to try to defend it. A few people who have come across it contacted me to say wow finally a list that is reasonable which is basically all I was ever hoping for.Even a sloppy attempt at putting into writing the logic behind a persons type would take immensely more space per person than celebritytypes writes especially when ones understanding goes beyond hes meticulous therefore hes a sensor which is the norm with celebritytypes just as sundayblooms says.For the most part I try not to use some bullet point list of evidence but to achieve a degree of conclusiveness with assorted knowledge and techniques. And I have enough experience to have internally a quantitative sense of confidence and what it means for something to actually be known or unknown.Its just something that I feel is too hard to express to people in a way that is easily read and understood.

2098322,0,t1_cl174ej,Im an INTP but the same things is told to me. Im able to push my work off until the last minute or make it so my work only takes up as little time as is possible. While this might seem lazy some people dont seem to understand that doing this quickly is efficient not lazy. The best and most frequent example would be with my mother. Shes would constantly criticize me for not getting my school work done especially long term assignments like projects or papers. I would always push then off for two reasons I hated doing any school work and would rather learn something interestinggo outside and I knew I could always get it done quickly last minute. Naturally I came off as someone who just had a problem with procrastination. Its hard to explain to someone else my mother especially that it doesnt matter when something gets done as long as it gets done. Id also turn around and put an enormous amount of effort into certain assignments like the ones which are interesting to me. So I was called lazy as I would show how much effort I put into somethings but not the majority of my work. Also the fact that I would score high on tests without studyingputting effort forth compared to my siblings further lead my mom to believe I was just ring lazy and not using my potential. I always assumed that I was simply trying to rationalize my procrastination making excuses. But I wasnt its just how I work. I cant magically create motivation and enthusiasm to work on something that it is seemingly pointless to me. I wasnt wasting my potential at all I was devoting it to a thing I found more useful.

Or is it just EM thats not genuine or from the heart that gets you upset? ,mbti,cmputx7,2,t5_2s90r
2538349,0,t1_cmputx7,Good question! I was actually trying to examine my feelings about those sorts of things when I was writing my comment. Emotional films are great and I admire movies that can cause me to have a strong emotional reaction. Though I am picky about what I watch and what I get worked up over  but Ive always seen that as a personal preference not a judgment against the movies I dont prefer. I dont know why music is different. Maybe its because the story of the movie combined with good acting can really ring true for me and I can put myself in the story or I can imagining it happening to someone and imagine what they were feeling. Whereas a song is comparatively short and has relatively little context and someone sounding on the verge of tears in a  minute song just doesnt ring true and doesnt let me suspend belief especially when the next song is upbeat or something. Maybe a concept album that builds to a climax would be different. Ads are terrible yeah but I can just turn them off or not look at them. Side note I do really hate propaganda type pictures like the crying kid hugging the cop in Oregon in the aftermath of the Ferguson verdict. It was getting shared all over facebook with the headline Cop Hugs a Tearful Boy in this Powerful Ferguson Protest Picture and it made me angry  its clearly just a feel good image with very little context. Then later I saw this article which claims it was staged and like of course. It was an empty feel good image. The implied condescension does bug me but I think the fact that its not genuine bugs me more. I dont mind normal social emotional manipulation smiling and laughing when you dont mean it I guess its when people go above and beyond to affect you that it makes my blood boil. My MIL is totally guilty of this. Just give a genuine emotional reaction and let people decide how they feel about it. You cant control everyone Im looking at you MIL! ,mbti,cmpwcie,2,t5_2s90r

The way they behave at a shallow level might not be dat ExxP excitement yo especially in a casual socialdrinking setting but as you pick their brain youll find that theyre completely different.ESFP take things at face value. They think about what is immediately in front of them extrapolate from that a little then move on to the next thing. Im married to one of these he just literally moves from one thing he sees to the next to the next. He doesnt analyse unless he FEELS very strongly about something and I literally force him to say WHY. ENTP on the other hand analyse everything to shit. They like to think about things a lot more and tend to have more rambling unordered thought processes. They like your friend like taking things apart and...ahem...arguing both points of view.

2742067,0,t3_2rgisv,Ti dom here. I live in my own inner world and I base aspects of it off of the outer world which I am constantly working to understand. I dont always trust external data completely because my perception of it could be quite flawed indeed. I come up with ways of acting and test them out in the real world. If I get a favorable result Ill add them to my inner framework. However I wont try out ways of acting that make me uncomfortable or are inconsistent with my values For instance I wouldnt eat turkey just to appease the person who made the dish because I dont eat sentient beings. I would explain why I cant enjoy what they made to avoid upsetting them and then perhaps comment on how great another dish they made is. Then again Im kind of a weird INTP with highly developed Ni and Fi as a result of my Mom brother best friend and  other friends being INTJ. Ive essentially interacted with Ni doms my entire childhood and one Si dom my father ISTJ. Its kind of a wonder how I managed to develop Ti dom and Ne aux my two mostused functions. ,mbti,cnfrfgf,2,t5_2s90r
2753968,0,t1_cnf1jqe,I think to some people immersion in the occult is no different than immersion in art or sports. Theres actually real work going on in divination and if flexibility in applying intuition to real life problems comes naturally a belief system can actually safe guard against over reliance on a weaker function just because the current paradigm approves of it over the approach that you are naturally inclined toward. I actually made better decisions when I was religious because my Ni was doing most of the heavy lifting. While Im not entirely illogical I know that the type of deliberate pragmatism that is often the only way to explain your choices and opinions tends to cause me problems because I take in more variables than needed Im too rigid and specific in my conclusions and my thinking becomes convoluted. But if you let me just walk into the woods and hear a voice chances are its only because all the background processing has done its thing and Im not trying to latch onto every little thing that occurs to me. I think its one of the reasons why occultists dont really tend to be ambitious T types can just work through the endless pile of crap the world throughs at them on s step by step case by case basis N just kind of gets overwhelmed by it.Jung is good for getting a handle on the roots of mbti. I agree with the functional model and as I said earlier while I have a problem with his having only  types Ive found that if I read all the descriptions of my functional stack and all the descriptions of those who are dominated it seems to match up pretty well.If you are worried about confirmation bias you might want to start typing other people. It s just more or less being like oh so its one of those types of people which is an entirely reasonable thing to if you dont start dehumanizing people by it.Some people like mbti because it helps them understand others better some like it because it helps them understand themselves better. Personally I found that it just helped me accept myself as I am and stop worrying so much about whether or not I was losing my mind. Ni dominance is rare and I am very much the Jungian discription of the Ni Dom. Try explaining yourself to people when you are like that... You basically wind up acting like a robot to keep people out of your face and kind of wind up losing a huge chunk of your personality in the process. I didnt really want to live in the woods but I definitely wanted to live in a strange city isolated from anybody who cared about me... One of those crazy things that you cant really explain to people or even yourself but in retrospect would have been a lot healthier for me.,mbti,cnh44vj,1,t5_2s90r

While INFJ seems to get tied to the supernatural sadly Ive seen literal ties to it while ignoring their interpersonal actions. As for tertiary.  Most types have a decent use of tertiary despite popular belief. INFJ NiFeTiSe. Neither judging function is in the dominantinferior position making it easier to flip between the two. Now look at INTP TiNeSiFe. Now it is neither perceiving function is in dominferior position allowing the popular INTP thesaurus idea to come forth. Its just you are hyper aware of using them. Again INTJ descriptions kinda fail here suggesting INTJs Fi is like their inferior. I think why the INFJ have such a focus harkens to the days on forums when people would insinuate XXFX types were dumber which is wrong and INFJs would play the tertiary Ti card a lot. ,mbti,cpgo46r,8,t5_2s90r

3650115,0,t1_cq8bwwh,I think most of our communication is done through Te which is focused on making judgments based on impersonal fact. This means INTJs can communicate things very clearly but often in a way that seems cold and unsympathetic. When you combine this with introversion which means less of a need for social interaction and thus less incentive to develop these skills like an ENTJ would it can result in someone that seems a bit robotic and disinterested in human affairs.An INFP leads with Fi which means what you might call the human element is right up front as the primary form of judgment you make about things. Because Te is repressed in INFPs unlike with an ENFP who probably can more easily relate to the INTJs Te communication style since they themselves also have unrepressed Te youre likely to find this communication style inherently grating in the same way an INTJ with repressed Se might find a loud dance club grating.That being said is this with your experience with INTJs out in the world or on Reddit?

3952097,0,t3_35mxj3,The testtest takers are both inaccurate  the test is generally a shit way to prove anything. Ive seen ESFJs and ESTJs get INTJ. It has no idea it just bases it off of what people THINK theyre like which is a whole separate problem.  I did not believe my first result when i received it. I did more research with a friend over a few months until i finally settled into it. It did make sense once the idea was explored and not just accepted. I would bounce between INFJ and INTJ. The functions which most new comers miss is eventually what typed me  and it fits. A professional test is ok. In my opinion theyre a few levels above an online test. I truly believe you have to search for the answer without any type in mind. Having a friend who can be honest and say You dont actually do x you just think you do is a good tool for exploring. i.e. I thought i expressed emotions several times than what i actually do. It blew me away when people said i dont. No one really discussed it with me before and i had not thought about it. Same thing goes for professional confirmation. A very useful guide and they provide a knowledgeable friend who can help  but it is a long process to be accurate. I believe the age that people become consistent is in their teens around .

4019291,0,t1_cre7ees,No I honestly do believe in the idea of Platonic forms and perfect universal truths... Learning about them in philosophy made me immediately love them. For this reason Ti seems right to me on a way deeper level than Te. I might use Te more than Ti in social situations but when I have some alone time and think things over philosophically I just naturally go with Ti. It also makes more sense for me to have artificially developed Te than Ti due to a scienceheavy education which favours seeing the physical world as objective. I used to think I was in the INTP category for a short time and I still love the Tiheavy discussions that are common over at rintp. ,mbti,crefhco,1,t5_2s90r
4027313,0,t3_36he0f,One thing you want to take note of is that Ti and Fi both serve a similar role in the psyche As introverted judging functions both build inside a person a set of values and principles that dont easily keel over to outside input that are primarily born inside the person and can thus become idiosyncratic. I tend to like the analogy that Fi grows a beating biological heart and creates a soul inside a person while Ti builds an elaborate mechanical wonder and writes an AI  both do a similar job but one is bound to be colder and more impersonal.The same is reflected on the extroverted side of the axis where Fe and Te can be used to do the same things but Fe feels warmer than Te which can come across as cold impersonal and callous.This tends to be why Ti users have high Fi scores in function tests both value independence a lot essentially.A Tidoms primary objective is mostly understanding the truth of the world not so much melding with it as the TiFe axis is often portrayed. INTPs especially are drawn to the idea of a separate observer studying whats going on.As far as learning about the functions more thoroughly you cant get better than Pierces Lessons playlist for a crash course on functional typologyLessons on functionsbased typologyAfter the LessonsPierces portraits of the sixteen types in videoPierces portraits of the sixteen types as textAnother look at the functions by PierceMy takes on some things A bit of elaboration on what a function is and especially is not plus comparisons between Thinking Feeling and Intuitive functions. No textwall on Sensing as of yet These have been wellreceived and should do well in adding flavour to the raw mechanical descriptions.An explanation of what I think a function is and especially is not using Te and Ti as examples plus some elaboration on their natureObservations on the differences between Fe and FiThe difference between Ne and NiCelebritytypes also has a good lookover of the functions,mbti,crfcdn8,3,t5_2s90r

4142062,0,t1_crsbl12,You seem way too attuned to and accepting of your inner experience to be anything but a dominant introverted perceiver and between Te and Fe I think your selfdescription favors the latter. The only reason I didnt say ISFJ despite also seeing a decent amount of Si is that I didnt see much Neduality the times you did mention your ability to shift perspective and connect dissimilar concepts seemed rather limited and mild and I saw similarly weak Te duality which was another strike against INFP and completely removed ENTJ as a possibility. The fact that you acknowledged how inconsistently beneficial and detrimental your Se is could either mean that you shaped your post andor its an actual point of weakness and insecurity for you. Plus Ni is just difficult to spot without extended interaction period.

All of yall Ive ever met have had huge issues in this regard which is heartbreaking. People will love you even if youre not perfect.INFJ Tell someone what youre really afraid of.ENFJ Reexamine a deeply held belief. You dont have to change it.

Make sure youre on the same page.ENTP Make a list of all the projects that youre halfway through and choose whether to ax them completely or finish them. Then finish the easiest one.INFP The next time you need to go somewhere try leaving  minutes earlier.ENFP Remember that you are only what youve done. You are not what people tell you you can be or what you want to be you are only the sum of your actions. If youre okay with that have a kegger. If not figure out what the person you want to be would have done and do it.ESTJ How do the people you love know that you love them? You might think they know because of everything you do to help them but doublecheck. Hug them and tell them that you love them.ISTJ Make a bucket list if you dont already have one and do something off it.ESFJ Is there a relationship in your life that is all give no return? Is there someone whos toxic and only brings you down? You are under no obligation to put up with them. Cut them off.ISFJ Take a day off. Get a massage or go to the beach or go to the museum. But do it alone. This day is just about you.ESFP Ask yourself which people in your general circle of acquaintance are usually right about things and people. They are probably also right about you.

I also remember reading somewhere that Ne is the least statusseeking function while Se has a bit of a tendency of wanting to be an alpha.Finally you could look at the construction of the cognitionISTPs are competencedriven  they seek to understand a discipline and then demonstrate that understanding in the real world  their argument for the correctness of their understanding are their results in a sense that their approach is an effective one. The flow of an ISTP is to understand then to act confidently. Se is also an extroverted and therefore fast and nimble perception function so it makes sense that ISTPs would be at ease adapting to situations on the fly. Then add the alpha stuff and bam.INTPs tend to want to go where their reason takes them  Ne ventures on an on Ti checks whether things make sense and structure the sensible stuff to gain a foothold. Its a neverending process. The key here is a low investure of themselves into the conclusion  the truth is in the reason less so in the force of the INTP himself. They just explain the logic.

I mean such qualities someone identifies come to people unconsciously they arent even aware of it most of the time. gt but I never run around embarrassing myself looking like a dickhead.Anyone can have that moment its just differently expressed. Se does it in an intense manner that focuses the attention.gt I notice immediately when Ive said something wrong or hurt someone I see it on their face so I am very cautious of what I say or do.Yes awareness of the atmosphere and accommodating to keep it harmonious which then can be seen as being a conman doing it for their own hidden purpose as FiTe users would understand it instead of keeping an open environment for thoughts with no real motives they are expressions to be fundamentally understood nothing more.gt Any ESTP who is successful gets typed as ENTJESTPs do have a sense of accomplishment but its not an accomplishment of a goal its an accomplishment of skill the goal is tangential how you got to it and what it took is what gives it meaning not the result.gt Any ESTP who is smart gets typed as ENTPN bias aside on the surface they express themselves similarly and since you dont need to dig deeper and take in the immediate information then it doesnt come out wrong.gt Any ESTP who is an actor or musician gets typed as INFJUhm... INFJs are more renowned writer. ESTPs are amazing actors because it comes so naturally to them and music is also a testament of skill they perceive as a challenge to overcome and interest that keeps your attention.gt type them as something else and then form their opinion of ESTPs based on the ones that are leftIts kinda hard not to do that when high school always has that one guy who is bored with classes and has to do something else and disturbs the teaching environment. Of course that includes the girls talking and the educational system being shit but still the need for stimulation becomes distracting.gt Do people have to be Introverts to be intelligentIt isnt as much intelligence as it is diving in your mind and fleshing stuff out calmly with disturbance or sudden change. Of course theres the N bias but thats Keisey woefully underestimating Sensors inclinations abilities and skills.gt Can an ESTP not be interested in reading books or learning?Anyone can be but Se types wont be doing for entire days.gt Just because I dont like to sit around and talk about something boring at length does not make me dumb because I LOVE to talk about things that interest me.Who doesnt. Interests differ.gt I think maybe some of you have had bad experiences with people and you have typed them wrongTheres an ESFP I meet occasionally hes an egocentric loudmouth almost toxic hes friends with my roommate and I loathe just seeing him. I know another ESFP whom I get along with smoothly and I live with him because hes my roommate we can talk about anything and not get irritated for a moment.gt Maybe they were  years old at the time and had no selfawareness or maturity?Yes by kicking me in the head after I humiliated him on exam day after him fooling around for months. So he can disturb class but I cant have my gluttonous retribution.gt  I dont judge anyone for their type it helps me to understand them better so why would I use it against them?Same here I use typology as a basis for my judgements and my criticisms are to make people aware of their cognition and how it comes out in behavior. I have  ESTPs at work which can be considered having a douchey attitude of riffing on but they keep it to each other and its for laughs yet at the same time a joking statement about a real possibility gives me the impression that its more of an undecided action.

But INTJs forth function is Se which can drive one into a more physical pursuit. For her it was surgery for you it could be cooking. The things you need to look at is what makes you like cooking. For Christina its the challenge the thrill and what not. You also need to look at self direction. One thing INTJs are widely known for is self direction. They know what they want and they know how to get it. Christina also shared this characteristic. And dont fall under the presumption or the falsehood that INTJs are close minded to others. They are very open to other peoples choices and perspectives. They just know what they want and dont want to be told what to do or how to do it.

My theory is that extroverts primarily interact more with the outside world so they learn to be more open to create relationships faster. The more relationships the more they can use their extroverted function which is a big need. For example for me I dont see many reasons to be an open book because most social interactions do not satisfy my Ti they only satisfy my Ne and to some extent my Fe.

5381764,0,t1_cvziqkf,Any reason for Fi over Se or is it just a vibe? I remember you linking a video but I could not really get into it. By the way Ive noticed that Im hyperaware of hurting someone elses feelings. For example a few hours ago I was thanking someone via text and even though I was genuinely grateful I wondered whether the other guy would misinterpret it as me being condescending I dont use emoticons because I find them obnoxious and feel that they exaggerate or distort what I want to convey. I once had someone type me in another forum after a fairly long conversation and after a while I naturally started doubting my type. However I hesitated to publicly change my type because I felt that by doing so I was kind of shitting on the help hed provided me and disrespecting him. In college I used to sit next to this person and eventually I decided to change my seat and asked her if I didnt seem rude. She said that she didnt even consider this point of view and that you could sit wherever the hell you wanted. I dont really relate to this because I see all these interpersonal dynamics and boundaries where I recognize how close am I to different people or how their relations with each other are. I wont just sit next to a total stranger especially if he had his own group of friends in his vicinity. I would feel like an intruder I didnt belong there. In fact this is why Im so socially anxious. Never identified with the whole socially awkward thing where you dont know how your actions affect other people. Im the opposite. Im too aware of that shit. ,mbti,cvzkxg6,2,t5_2s90r

In effective dominant Extraverted Sensing types the enjoyment of sensual pleasures is natural spontaneous and quite consistent with their focus on the reality of the immediate environment. In Introverted Intuitive types in the grip of inferior Extraverted Sensing this quality takes the form of sensual excess rather than sensual pleasure. It is interesting that a number of INTJs and INFJs described themselves as becoming selfcentered and selfindulgent when they are in the gripa descriptor often projected onto wellfunctioning Extraverted Sensing types by INTJs and INFJs and by other types as well. Overdoing gratification of the senses is a commonly mentioned behavior for INTJs and INFJs in the grip of their inferior function. they may overeat or binge. They see themselves as obsessively doing harm to their bodies. A typical tactic is to overindulge compulsively and immediately therafterif not during the episodeberate themselves for their uncontrolled shallow destructive behavior. ,mbti,cw12ciw,1,t5_2s90r

5620791,0,t1_cwsxlxd,Well in the case of an ISFJ this is about where I think I was heading into shakier ground but did have some ideas about it.  There are a few other types of stress eating that I think would correlate with an ISFJ function stack.  There is comfort eating which is eating comfort foods basically because of what it reminds you of or out of tradition.  This may be during the holidays for example or just indulging in one of your favorite foods because you are stressed and it brings about positive feelings.  There is also nervous eating.  Having Ne in your stack brings with it a certain level of nervous energy particularly when it is your inferior. This may be an oral fixation and needing something to do with your mouth or hands.  For me it is smoking and drinking but that probably isnt much different than eating just a matter of picking your poison. The third is social eating.  This is where you get together with your friends and vent over dinner.  Superficially this sounds like Fe but I think that Fi users do this just as much.  I think the best bet if you are trying to solve this problem is to identify the source.  Identify the nature of your stress and what you are trying to satiate by eating.  People overeat for many reasons and sometimes it isnt really type related but just that food is good and a necessary part of life.  ,mbti,cwtta02,1,t5_2s90r

5960713,0,t1_cxyfqm7,Ive been watching his stream and I think that Dyrus just has really good FeFi accuracy like in his mind he figured out it is logical to have Fi accuracy and has been in that mindset of trying to be both Ti and Fi accurate for a while which Ive also been into for some time also but in my case starting Fi going into Ti. Because it seems like I can often feel what he means as if he were an Fi dom feeling meanings in words spoken and it also seems like he is good at knowing whats morally rightwrong. What I am starting to see as truth is that most IxTPs hit a dilemma with morals early on and try really hard not to appear insensitive and Ive even talked about this with an INTP friend of mine she really really does care and is afraid of hurting others feelings.Both other than that I also think he is just more emotional inside than most INTPs.

6038713,0,t1_cyb6cgd,Experiencing it myselfand playing GTA IV whose protagonist shows ISTJ qualities when hes not a Mary Sue.  At the end of the day you have to face facts and the world as it is or at most how you see said reality. Adhering to that experience a certain transitional aspect of fantasy to reality and back becomes more present. As in you can see how that fantasy can finally be done in reality how you can integrate it even if it had nothing to do with the original model it has become warped and twisted to fit in the framework of the world rather than your imagination which is played down.  Even if it is still focused on the subjective impression of the real world it is the same concrete information that you deal with in your real life. Sooner or later you have to embrace it and this is the process for that everyone needs to be aware of what is because there would be no basis for what could be and vice versa.  Si downplays the ideals as ideal reality a more simple if utilitarian model that looks like your daily life even if its still warped with quirky elements from the mind but its all there to show how reality affects you whether you like it or not your mind reflects those aspects just as well. Its not an ideal model as Fi would like but for once its one that can actually work.,mbti,cyb6r9j,6,t5_2s90r

6058655,0,t3_3yinnk,Suggestion do an MBTI test first then approach someone to help type you. I know the number one rule are that tests arent accurate but its a good start. A good test to use would be the one from keyscognition google it  instead of the generic  letter typing that many sites like personalities may use it uses a marginally more accurate method called cognitive function typing. Afterwards you can send your results to someone who studies mbti and they can help you out. Evidently this isnt as accurate as studying mbti and typing yourself but its decently accurate. ,mbti,cydsam5,1,t5_2s90r

For certain people to say that Fidoms cannot logically analyze isnt true since there are plenty of INFPs studying logicbased subjects and they score rd highest on reasoning tests behind INTP and INTJ of course.

6098643,0,t1_cyit64c,gt Bard is ESXP for sure. Maybe a particularly smart ESFP? Can ESFPs have a gallows sense of humor?Certainly ESFPs can have any sort of sense of humor. Individuals can vary a lot even within the same type  and remember that MBTI type is only measuring a few certain traits and measuring them crudely at that. ESFPs can be very smart as well  there are type correlations with intelligence but individual variation is much more important. I honestly am not super familiar with how ISTJs operate but my stereotype of them is that they are quite rigid and bythebook. I guess that since there probably isnt a bythebook way to deal with being undead he would pull from his own experience a lot to figure things out. As for the inferior Ne I think that would manifest in rare situations and not very well. My understanding is that the inferior function tends to emerge when the  person is under a lot of stress so paranoia from unknowns is probably not farfetched.I think applying knowledge is more a realm of the judging functions F and T than the perceiving ones S  and N. So if Amras is the applyer it would mostly emerge via his Fe. Fe tends to be focused on harmony and relationships so if that is how he tends to work always diplomatically solving problems and taking people into account then hes definitely a strong Fe user. Of course he could be more if an INXJ who uses TeFe in tandem and doesnt heavily favor one or the other like you said how he has morals but breaks them when its needed. I think Amadeus could be an ENTP or ENTJ fairly easily. I think it will really depend on his internal dialogue  how does he process those leaps in logic? TiNe functions very differently from NiTe. TiNe happens when you come up with a million different ideas and then logically analyze them to figure out what makes sense and what doesnt. Its very contemplative and slow but also produces the most logical well thoughtout results. NiTe on the other hand is much more organic and subconscious. Te is trying to find the solution to some problem and Ni is behind the scenes doing its own analysis. finally Ni bubbles up to the surface with some great insight that Te can latch onto and apply. Its more practical and gets more done than TiNe but is far less esoteric and elegant. As for how this group would function I think that really depends on the situation. It would be really different in an adventure story vs a political intrigue story for example. ,mbti,cyiuqeo,2,t5_2s90r

Both are skeptical of their results and the concept of MBTI boxing people into categories which probably explains why they wouldnt be interested in discussing about it online. Furthermore I noticed that ISFPs are adept at camouflaging their true personality my two friends are perceived as extroverted leaders by those who dont know them well which is pretty far from who they actually are deep down.

I have an amazing ENTP teacher who I still think is awesome but after identifying their behaviour they just seem so... Predictable now? Instead of being amazed by their approach with logic suppression of feeling despite valuing it now I know its just a result of their intrinsic behaviour.Which sucks. Im very much of the mindset that people can CHOOSE to be like whatever they want. But who they choose to be is linked to who they already are which is who they always were... Its shitty.

The delta office often had a lot of NeSi types there whereas the new place is very rife of SeNi types. My supervisor at my new office is an INTJ probably and the manager is an LIE for example.

6463592,0,t1_cznkzve,Ti vs TeTe is the extroverted part of thinking I know nothing discovered here it deals with what is there in the real world. Ti is the introverted part it takes in data from extraverted functions and tries to make up the logic of how stuff works. Ti needs understand how they work to say they work it cant just observe them working like Te. Logic being coherent in your head is more important then that  logic being coherent in real world. Ti often doesnt even need to observe a thing being in the real world to validate it or perceive its there.I.e. when Im learning or writing in new programming language in the beginning is always try to form some idea of syntax take some examples apart   put them back together in different order see what changes in the output. Unfortunately I still havent managed to make my thinking function cooperate on taking in knowledge from manuals and tutorials. It goes really smoothly until I get stuck trying to find some syntaxexpression which doesnt exist for hours. My Ti assumes it exists because it saw similar language with that expressionsyntax and basically filed in the gap for me. So Im stuck for a few hours browsing manuals and forums trying to find that expression because Im dead sure I either saw it before or its so logical that it exists. Or my Ti tries to trouble shoot writing the syntaxexpression with mistake examples from other languages  ie. maybe we need  at the end? maybe we need indent at the beginning? which obviously doesnt work as the thing it tries to correct doesnt exist in the first place. So for Ti its logical that it exists therefore it exists Te we need a proof it exists even if its logical it exists.,mbti,cznvon6,1,t5_2s90r

Dont beat yourself up for failure but look at it as an opportunity to learn. Youre not a special snowflake and dont brood about how different you are. Fill in roles that no one else can. Build up your confidence. Take time for yourself to rest and relax. You will still have time to grow and get better and even better if you take the time to take care of yourself. Write. When you struggle to speak and no one wants to listen to what you have to say write. Slow down when you talk and go through logical steps and dont make intuitive leaps.

Theres nothing he hates more than being just like everyone else. The quote cutting off your nose to spite your face describes him pretty well.

Hes very inconsistent and unpredictable.Im pretty stubborn and hate being like everyone else too.  But I see it way different than he does.  I dont argue to be right I argue because I feel passionately about things.  I have to be right too but only if I personally feel that I am.  Im quite the opposite of impulsive.  Everything I do is well thought out and calculated to the point where I get intense anxiety.  Im very idealistic and like to think I could one day live in a world where no wrong could happen.

The body language approach is not something that is shared by all of the authors and is mostly some fringe part that I dont subscribe to.gtWant to compare how many different things I wrote about Se polr and how many things you wrote about Se polr?  What? You wrote the same wrong thing over and over. That description of Se porl is a poor translation of what it actually is. Again the thread I linked does a significantly better job at distilling the essence of the PORL function from far better Scoionics contributors. But at this point who cares.

It can help me get a sense of what youre like and then I can give you my opinion based on my impression.  Not definitive but another clue perhaps. Four questions to start.  Read each scenario carefully and then tell me what your visceral gut reactions would be in these situations.  Be careful  not what you would say or do but rather what you would notice first and what thoughts or feelings would be running through your mind.  The more detail the better.  Answer each one before reading the next.  Note of course that there are no right answers Im just trying to get to know you better.. You and your significant other have made plans to go to the event of a lifetime tonight when you get home from work  maybe meeting your idol or going on a huge trip something youve been dreaming of doing for a while.  Theyre supposed to be all packed and ready to go when you walk in the door.  You get home and not only are they not packed  theyre sitting in their pajamas with someone the same gender as you theyve been drinking red wine and spilled it everywhere and they look up at you and smile Hey sweetie!  I know were supposed to go soon but do you want to play Monopoly with us first?  Whats the first thought that goes through your mind?  What do you notice first?  How are you feeling and why?  Without thinking about what was right or what made sense what would you want to do in that moment?. Think of a time when someone said or did something for you that really touched you  made you feel extremely loved wanted special or understood.  Or if its easier imagine what someone could do to make you feel this way.  Describe the encounter in detail what they said or did why it was important and how it made you feel.  Make sure to mention whether its something that actually happened or something that could happen.. You are walking home in an unfamiliar city.  You are not sure youre going the right way because the street names are in a foreign language.  You see a homeless man sitting in the middle of the street wearing a duck costume.  Hes sitting on the dirty ground and its pouring rain.  People are walking past him  most are ignoring him some are laughing a few are shouting insults.  Next to the street on one side there are several shops and restaurants.  The Italian pizzeria smells delicious.  There is also an antique bookstore with a new copy of Harry Potter in the window.  On the other side of the street there is a rushing river.  Children are playing with stones and sticks on the muddy banks of the river and there are several mother ducks and baby ducklings swimming around.  What do you notice first?  What sticks in your mind?  What are you thinking?  What are you feeling?  What do you want to do now?. You come home and find a package in front of your door.  Inside is a mysterious metal box with symbols all over the outside levers and gears and a folded note.  What do you think when you see this?  What do you feel?

So it just sits there ignored and festering stinking up other portions of our life while we ignore the smell or attribute it to something else.What type are you?

6873120,0,t3_49uvfh,I used to be in the Marines and since graduating from college Ive worked exclusively in the veteranseducation field PTSD comes up a lot as part of the job. Im an ISTP myself so I understand your logic about PTSD and rational thinkers not really gelling Im sure different types handle trauma differently.However more and more studies are being conducted that are preliminarily showing a connection between PTSD diagnoses and physiological changes in the brain. This has been cropping up in both veterans and nonveterans the thought for a while was that physiological brain changes in veterans with PTSD may have been linked to traumatic brain injuries from explosionsconcussions.So although I cant offer a solution very nonISTP of me I just wanted to point out that there could be a possibility that theres a physiological reason instead of a psychological one for the existencelingering effects of PTSD and you might considering researching it from that angle if you wanted.,mbti,d0vdphq,4,t5_2s90r

Though like others have said it requires that you become detached from the people involved which can be an absolute bitch. Sometimes that can be a good thing as being passionate can help you dive deep into any given case but when push comes to shove its a deep analysis grounded in the data that will come out on top of a deep analysis driven by passion. It seems stupid but thats how it is.

7118806,0,t1_d1mvlo8,Wow that description you linked to is really fascinating to megt Si needs experience. Ni needs information. Sometimes experience is drawn from outside information. Sometimes information is drawn from experience. I hadnt thought of it that way but  it seems true. ...gtSi cares about how information relates to their experience or viseversa. Ni cares about how their experience relates to their perception of the universe or viseversa. The Ni part is certainly true for me as a Nidom. INFJ thoughSeems to me that the focus really is different. Its like whats the primary reference point or from another angle purpose or orientation of focus of the perception? For a Nidom it all relates to perception and experience of the universe  or whatever to call it whatever that is specifically for that particular person. Whereas for Sidom that lived experience is not only a source of information like it also is for Nidom  for me its absolutely crucial but also its the primary reference point for perception.This is rather clear in my head but not sure if its as clear in what Im writing. I just feel like  apart from the focus on linear time pastpresentfuture maybe this thing about what is the primary reference point for the material you perceive might also be of some use in differentiating. ?? ,mbti,d1nbkve,2,t5_2s90r

7131631,0,t1_d1okovw,gt Oh could you please elaborate further?Sure There were a few things that made me think Si and a few things that indicated to me nonprioritized Negt I love the feeling of completing daily routine things and ticking it off my planner. Making lists of daily routine things and enjoying checking them off is more associated with ISTJs than INTJs. I got more of a sense that you enjoy tackling several problems every day and finishing them.INTJs do also like seeing things to completion but I think they are unlikely to derive much joy out of daytoday life activities. From what I understand INTJs typically do a lot of thinking and research before starting in on a plan and would probably be more likely to say something like solving problems energizes them.gt  I like to look at things from different perspectives detaching myself from the idea or whatever and therefore seeing the best sought route to go.This sounded to me a lot like Ne and also like something you do consciously I think Ni and especially dominant Ni is more subconsciously coming to one conclusion and once that is reached typically feels little need to consider other ways or methods of approach at least that are not dependent on external evidence or research.gt  I would probably keep to myself. While simultaneously arguing against their claim in my head trying to go around how best to approach the situation when I finally do say something. Which always necessarily doesnt go well. This also seemed more like Ne testing out this and that trying to find the best way.In terms of Si you seem overall like you are fairly cautious and like to play it safe to give one examplegt  I love oceans but this is very dark kinda makes me want to get out of there as quickly as possible.which is part of why you consider so many perspectives in the first place.In terms of Ni and Se I didnt really see much there. More that you were very cognizant of not holding yourself to certain experiences and wanted to be as effective as possible in terms of how you understood things and dealt with the world.Im not an expert on the differences between INTJs and ISTJs but I feel pretty confident you arent INTJ Have you looked into ISTJ descriptions or profiles? ,mbti,d1osc7q,2,t5_2s90r

7144800,0,t1_d1pz3uc,Ill see if I can address your concerns but I do think you are almost unquestionably not INTP your results on Johns test notwithstanding and I think INTJ is the likeliest type.I really have trouble imagining that you are anything else the way you write is very NiTe and everything you say is also consistent with INTJ.gt  INTJs are more practical not concerned with many potential aspects of an idea.Thats largely true but I think it gives a misleading impression of how very thorough INTJs are with ideas and topics that interest them.INTP thinking is very logical but also very selfcontained they are more likely to ignore or at least not seek out aspects and details and their explorations make internal sense but are just generally less thorough. INTPs have a tendency to not go as deep into an idea as INTJs do the potential aspects they consider can veer off in more unexpected directions and directions that are more idiosyncratic and individual to the INTP.gt  I assumed in   and  the reluctance to get in the way was a Fe thing and the reluctance to react directly to absurdity was Ne and FeReluctance to get in the way is also a very practical thing and an introverted thing in general. INTJs also value their relationships with their friends and many are not confrontational especially if they dont see a point to it or are unsure about how effective they could be in the case of the brokendown car. Im not sure which question was about reluctance to react to absurdity but in any case that doesnt seem unINTJ to me either.gt My Fe might be a bit developedI dont know your approach to confrontation sounds very rational to me.Also I was reminded of this comment by uparalloydgt A lot of behavior that most naturally arises from having Fe can easily be identified imitated and ultimately internalized. Its getting the Fi user to want to learn from Fe users that is the hard part.I dont think INTPs are more likely to be empathetic than INTJs. And indeed there is not a lot of Fe behavior that I even see in your responses. Ignoring people who are in your opinion acting stupid is not in and of itself exceptionally considerate behavior its not rude either and it is very INTJlike to be dismissive in that way.A few more observationsgt  Ill try to see it from their point or ask them to clarify in a non challenging way. This is a very INTJ response. In my experience INTJs often ask clarifying openended questions to better gauge where a person is coming from before deciding how or if they want to reply. INTPs are much less likely to do this it is just less natural for them to actively look for more external sources to clarify their ideas as clarification and testing is a much more internal process. INTPs may ask about specific details but they dont automatically or often ask such openended questions.This is especially true in cases like thisgt I tend to get hunches that theres more of a story than a conversation partner might be aware of. Ill ask questions to try to field if that hunch has any possible standing in reality again tactfully as with questions  and . INTPs would typically react to the story on its face or they might say that doesnt sound right or that doesnt make sense but they dont normally ask such probing questions.gt  If I try to ask some banal questions it just doesnt feel natural. This also is much more INTJ. An INTP might hate the idea of small talk but they would be more likely to judge the activity not their ability to engage in it.Those are my impressions I hope they help in some way. Let me know if you would like me to clarify something.,mbti,d1qae7d,2,t5_2s90r

I can see how it could be uncomfortable though.gt I feel I should also mention that I have a history of dissociative symptoms that are the product of trauma. The thought of having to separate my identity in any way typically throws me into a panic regardless of whether or not this was caused by meditation so that might have played some part in why I struggled so much.I kinda thought that might be the case based on the way you were describing things.  Ive had some dissociative episodes and I wouldnt wish that on anyone.  Ive found mindfulness meditation to be very helpful in grounding myself in the body but Ive also had some uncomfortable experiences that could have been terrifying if Id been in a bad place psychologically.

7415405,0,t1_d2l2gjb,gt I still believe Rackham is an ENTP. Towards the end where he gets obsessed with creating a legacy always seemed out of character to me and I chalk it up to questionable screen writing and not so much him not being an ENTP. Perhaps always having been seen as an underdog then being so close to gaining alot of power and respect and not getting it after hard work took a toll on him making him turn to a darker side of himself that seems nonENTPish ENTPs do love recognition just makes them cringe to showadmit it. Hes verbally gifted and his speech pattern to me says nothing but NeTi. He definitley fails to see long term implications and is very here and noworiented Ne. However his NeTi helps him often see alternate solutions that others miss and added with his creativity and sense of humour it makes him a decent captain in the end.I totally feel that. It seemed completely out of character for a second that they bring up that Jack cared most about his legacy. This is brought up when blackbeard comes backI started to see him maybe more as an ENTJ because I didnt see as much of Fe as I wanted from him. He seems to have new ideas and abilities but it kind of fades away after he gets away with owning the brothel. There was certaintly inconsistencies with how Jack was portrayed.gtMany ENTPs have great people skills and they are great at seeing the chore of people and very quickly judge who a person actually is as Ti screens through bullshit immidiately. But some are also due to not always having a filter clumsy and can blurt out stuff in the wrong situations which comes across as very crude. ENTPs that lets his Ti slam the brakes on their Ne before speaking are usually the smarter ones and its something that comes as they mature and develop.Yes completely agree. ENTPs will blurt things that are crude and step on peoples toes a bunch. Filter is definitely needed. John Silver belongs to the ENTP spectrum of people with high emotional intelligence.I think Jack Rackham needs more analysis as I have actually been stuttering between ENTP and ENTJ. The other reason I see him as an ENTJ is because he fits so well with Anne Bonne as an ISFP like duals thats why people see them as inseperable! Whereas an ENTP and ISFP is a conflicting relationship.,mbti,d2l30h8,2,t5_2s90r

Although I do feel that dom and aux being ENTJ and tert and inf being INTP lean toward ENTJ as being your answer.We can continue testing if youd like?   Dont feel like you have to just an option!A or B?A. The individual understands easily but is largely indifferent to discussions that focus on the internal logic of ideas and systems. The individual perceives such logical systems as largely worthless to his goals and finds them completely uninteresting and unproductive.B. The individual is adept at finding external sources of factual information and confident in his ability to evaluate their value but regards collecting data as secondary to making them fit into a consistent logical system. To him listing facts without analyzing their relationships is a trivial and boring exercise. He values efficiency and productivity but is skeptical that they will be achieved if ones actions and process do not follow a clear procedure. C or D?C. The individual is fairly good at generating all sorts of ideas but doesnt himself take the ideas seriously and views the activity as a sort of entertaining exercise lacking in value. It is more natural for him to apply his imagination and vision specifically to those areas where he is trying to achieve something than to indulge in thinking about things that have no relation to those areas of interest.D. The individual is quite adept at following discussions on the developments of present trends into the future and at contributing to them on occasion if he feels so inclined but he does not take that as seriously compared to investigating possibilities in the areas he is interested in at present. He usually dismisses supernatural claims as being silly wishful thinking unless they happen to be related to the very specific religion he feels inclined to believe in and which he may be inclined to make part of his leisure activities.E or F?E. The individual recognizes the existence and importance of personal relationships so he is usually cautious at first about offending others if he does not know them well. To minimize this risk he adheres somewhat simplistically to the relevant social conventions e.g. political correctness. However if taken too far this produces stress as it inhibits his natural inclination to voice exactly what his thoughts are on a given issue or situation with the expectation that others will appreciate his straightforwardness rather than accusing him of being insensitive. This caution gradually disappears as he gets to know people better. He prefers to develop relationships indirectly with others based on open conversation and common activities and only reveals his innermost personal feelings to those he has known for a long time. He may become confused and suspicious if they are directly solicited by others.F. The individual makes an effort to adapt to the prevailing emotional atmosphere especially in group situations and tries to promote a positive emotional environment as in making positive or witty remarks in the presence of individuals he is already somewhat acquainted with and appreciates. Such efforts however are normally lowkey and of short duration it is difficult for him to display emotions more complex or intense than enthusiasm. He is essentially unable to participate in a group atmosphere where intense emotional expression as in loud laughing and mutual jokes are prevailing. The individual makes an effort to be aware of the need not to disrupt the prevailing emotional atmosphere but he does not succeed for any length of time if that would clash with his inner emotional state and private feelings about the other persons present. A typical example is the person who in a group of people exchanging pleasantries and casual conversation will occasionally correct erroneous statements made by others in a way that can be perceived as annoying despite otherwise making an effort to abide by the prevailing emotional atmosphere.G or H?G.The individual tends to overreact to aggressive or confrontational behavior taking it as a personal threat when it may only be a kneejerk reaction or the result of a bad mood. He tends to avoid intruding on others space or engaging in behavior that may be perceived as coercive and tries hard to handle his needs by being disciplined and wellprepared himself  rather than relying on others to do things for him. If these strategies fail his efforts at dealing with the resulting conflict make him look actively pushy in a way that appears awkward and unnatural to others. This opens him up to painful criticism and feelings of weakness and helplessness.  He is able to moralize and instruct others about what they should do and why but he is not prepared for others active resistance or refusal to do as he says. In his mind this would require him to put aside reason and good feelings and simply make the other person do what is necessary. This is extremely difficult if not impossible for him to do.H. The individual tends to put a low priority on the physical shortdistance hereandnow in relation to longerdistance and longerterm considerations. A typical manifestation is a lack of concern for small aesthetic details since a greater focus is given on the opinion that in the longer term taking care of them is a neverending exercise. This is also manifested in a relative lack of awareness of the immediate surroundings as in noticing where objects may be if you dont have to deal with them particularly and of your own physical sensations.  This may manifest as a lack of concern for small aesthetic details or as a dislike for lowlevel practical details such as filling up forms signing documents or filling tax returns.,mbti,d2ndxtw,1,t5_2s90r

Ni more seeks to find the core essence of something a feeling of what makes the thing what it is. Platos Theory of Forms is a decent example if tainted by Tis need for a source outside the object.

7549029,0,t1_d309d1t,gt it seems like the Fiuser wants me to prove my regard for them by treating other people worse... um no thanks!I have noticed this trend as well! I think it may be a product of Fi users nuaced emtotional range which i personally consider a bit pointless. But then my Fe is tertiary and its entirely possible that Fe higher up the stack has a bit more granularity to it.I think that Fi users consider it pertinent to have emotional control and range and be personally responsible for it. This might appear to be selfish to an Fe user who is much more interested in exchanging emotion and putting it out there.This leads to the situation where Fi can see Fe as childish or manipulative if were following the context of the linked thread. For not being contained. But that is very clearly a product of the direction of functional expression.I might add at this point that Ti users can observe Te as being childish and inferior just the same way that Fi users observe FeFeelings that are on the inside should be controlled internally. But it can be difficult to imagine the inverse operation! Being responsible for the external emotional environment is no more superior or inferior in reality. Just different.Which was the main tongue in cheek point of this thread.Fe was described as disingenuous... however i would challenge that Fi user to show me a genuine interaction and then define the difference.

7567408,0,t1_d325o21,gt Yeah its literally hell p. But FWIW I still wouldnt rule out ESFJ for you based on what I saw in the typing chat and your subsequent posts. There are plenty of FJs in STEM fields. My ESFJ friend has a PhD in nanotech. Lower Ti has nothing to do with intellect or interests.You know it was unfortunate that you kinda got ignored after a certain point in that whole session and I did feel bad about it because you left with some amount of frustration. But I do think that while FJ does explain a little bit of my behavior what we discussed above when you take a step back my being any kind of FJ starts to look very incongruent with how I am.Like an ESFJ like all FJs are at a high level generally warm accommodating tactful socially aware good listeners organized meticulous interested in some greater good hard workers community  service oriented very proper somewhat judgmental and very capable of and interested in affecting their emotional environment.I might be some of these things some of the time but they certainly dont characterize me and most of the time people would use exactly the opposite words I think. Id think of myself as more analytical rationalist technical detached rather neurotic reserved forgetful sloppy shortcuts taking unkempt stuck in my own head addicted to learning and insight hermitlike sometimes too socially aggressive critical skeptical uncomfortable with gushiness irresponsible socially crude occasionally offensive shit at putting in real hard work and kinda happygolucky. So I thought INTP made the most sense for the longest time but being a cognitively extroverted ENTP seemed reasonable once it was proposed by pretty much everyone and their mom after I posted my video.I realize theyre stereotypes but like you said while they dont define the type they are byproducts and correlations of high Fe. I know by now that I use Fe but dominant or even aux Fe seems a little far fetched to me. If I ever were to identify as an FJ it would have to be a lesser one like the IFJs I think.,mbti,d32dlrq,1,t5_2s90r
7573379,0,t1_d32npj0,I agree with the notion that youre more of an INFJ and I can elaborate this for you. Especially since the th paragraph of your OP is surprisingly blatant. gt I can be extremely invested in my loved ones and friends. I keep a close circle.INFJs typically keep a tight personal circle because they subconsciously understand how much and how deeply misplaced faith and trust hurts. Because of this your investment among the ones you do trust is all the greater and it continuously builds up NiFe.gt I can very quickly determine when people arent the type that I would like to keep around.With Fe other peoples personalities and general demeanor are an objective to a conclusion. Like you said you are quick to determine and thus foresee with Ni how far you can reasonably expect a relationship to last as you weigh your own interests.gt I dont continue my interactions with those people but I am polite and friendly when I encounter them simply because its ridiculous and rude to be otherwise especially if they havent done anything wrong.Fe again. Sure youre disinterested in the relationship but you also recognize that people are not inherently evil cruel immoral etc.. You enjoy maintaining the peace and justice regardless of where you are FeTi.I also noticed something about the way Ni users write.

7584582,0,t1_d33lwmx,Using the letter dichotomies is not the most accurate way to type people. For example if we are having a conversation about how my aunt and uncle just died Im going to be talking about heavy stuff. I might be more expressive than usual or cry. This might lead you to think Im a feeler. However a conversation about how Im making a heart rate monitor for a class Im in right now might make you think I am more of a Thinker. Obviously a conversation does not change my personality type. What conversations can show is that I have a preference for Extroverted Intuition Introverted thinking Extroverted Feeling and Introverted Sensing. You can glean from things I say how my mind works and see those processes going on. Warning however Its not always what people say but how they express it that shows their type.The dichotomies also arent as in depth. For example they dont suggest how INTJs feel extremely strong feelings that they are often overwhelmed by and instead paint them as cold soulless robots who want to impose how they view the world onto others.

7627022,0,t3_4jqxyr,Id love to. Id have to think on it a bit but I think if people were to see sensors better they might be a more popular choice.I had an few ideas  and I wanted to run it by othersSi is basically like a connect the dots page. You know those ones where you have a bunch of dots with numbers? Well you connect all sorts of data points to form a pattern that gets an answer.The thing is long before you connect all the dots or even sometimes before you start you know what it is gunna be just from looking at it and the patter. You dont really have the solid tangible evidence all put together but once you connect a bit then you just know.I find it funny people say Si is about the past and present only because to me Si is highly predictive. It is looking for patterns and often times familiar ones. Once you find patterns you get a hunch that it is familiar and so you know the outcome ahead of time. If Si was not predictive then planning would fall part. But Si users are great at planning because they are great at probability.Lets say for example you have seen what an abusive relationship looks like. Your friend gets into one and even though he is happy you see signs and you know where this is going. Maybe you warn him and say.. something doesnt seem right here and I cant put my finger on it exactly. Or you recognize exactly and be like.. yo. This isnt right.I think for me I like using Si to find a pattern and then using Ne to generate a brand new idea off of the pattern I discovered. Combined I can analyze things and contribute new insights and information.So yeah to me Si is paradoxically past and future oriented at the same time. It is mostly about what you are expecting to happen but that requires knowing what has occurred before. I think it also helps stitch details together as well.I think a lot of Ni is mistaken for Si tbh. Si can seem abstract becuase it is the definition sometimes of intuition with hunches and flashes of insight. It is still irrational because you dont truly have proof.Now I dont have Ni so I cant say for sure.To me Ni seems to be more like th sense. If it is subjective that it is pulling from thin air and not from a pattern or external environment. Wheras Ne is tangental Ni just is almost mystical out of nowhere. Intuition as a process to me is about the generation of new content either spontaneous or tangential. ,mbti,d395go5,3,t5_2s90r

7699544,0,t3_4ks0vx,Honestly I dont really think that changing type to style is going to do anything. Replacing one word with another when they both mean exactly the same thing has always struck me as pointless when there isnt a difference in connotation  type is not negative whereas style isnt. Honestly explaining to people that they cant blame their weaknesses on their type any more than they can attribute their strengths to it is the best way to stop type stigma. As well making sure people know that the cognitive functions are the main point and are more about ones decisionmaking process than exact behaviors though they do cause tendencies towards certain behaviors is important  Im not an ENTJ because Im an Extroverted Intuitive Thinking Judger Im an ENTJ because I use Te Ni Se and Fi in that order. Once people know that I think that theyll hold other types in less stigma.Or theyll just dislike specific functions. Still thats progress of some sort at least.,mbti,d3hdysa,6,t5_2s90r

7702835,0,t3_4ks0vx,A major issue Ive always been conscious of and often have to catch myself from falling into is how limiting typology can be if it isnt studied and applied in the correct way. What I am referring to is using typology as a predictor or definer not only of behavior and temperament but also hobbies interests even physical appearances. In my opinion this is a major flaw to Kierseys typology. When you get into the weeds and really begin to remove yourself from the fact that typology is a general spectrum to predict tendencies my own personal colloquial definition the whole thing becomes incredibly limiting definite and boxy. ,mbti,d3hrena,1,t5_2s90r
7703392,0,t1_d3h9kjq,Im in agreement with you about Enneagram. It is generally the most accurate assessment of personality as thats really what its modeled after. Socionics and MBTI are more related to your processing and decision making which is highly variable depending on your values how you were raised. Enneagram type affects your MBTI direction as well funnily enough.gt The reality of the matter is that Socionics is just as much open to interpretation and individual variation as MBTI it is perhaps just written more sternly and authoritatively as it enjoys a greater consensus of thought that MBTI.Once again taking the words out of my mouth. Youre on fire.The reason Socionics has a more authoritative tone is that its actually literally a study within the Eastern bloc. You can study socionics in university there. MBTI was completely blasted by the academic community in the west. They call it similar to astrology which is completely inaccurate people in the psychology field in academia are generally dismissive of personality theories as a culture. This leads to MBTI being picked up by laypeople like ourselves.gtAs far as MBTI vs Socionics Im a reformed naysayer when it comes to Socionics. MBTI is like Algebra. It is relatively simple and works in most situations that the average person will ever conceivably use but at a certain point it falls short. You need Calculus which is like Socionics. To further the Calculus analogy think of an Algebra MBTI student that happens upon a set of Calculus problems without actually studying the discipline. You are going to recognize some things like xs and ys but the formulas and concepts are going to seem weird. You know enough to know that it doesnt quite makes sense. Both MBTI and Socionics dont really have a syllabus and to make things worse not only is there a lack of proper information and direction but there is more misinformation than reliable information readily available to confuse you.Analogy is on point. Perfect wording.,mbti,d3htoqu,3,t5_2s90r
7704871,0,t3_4kv2rc,Its easier to design questions based around the dichotomies. For instance a question like do you prefer a traditional method or do you create your own? might be intended to test for Si usage but in reality every function could have a reason to prefer an old way of doing things vs a new way. Functions are interrelated with one another and coexist based on pairings and the axises theyre on and yield unique results because of this. Also someones personal experience can factor into their overall decision making as well which makes it extremely hard to design a test based on just function usage alone.EDIT Also I think its worth mentioning that the official MBTI test people have seemed to distance themselves from the congnitive functions. IIRC Stephen Colbert had a video where he got typed by an official MBTI practitioner and the cognitive functions werent even mentioned during the entire video. MBTIs original purpose was to simplify the congnitive functions into a four letter code and its evolved over time to just focusing on the dichotomies and not over complicating things. Functions can be hard to grasp especially if youre new to typology.,mbti,d3hzqqh,10,t5_2s90r
7711411,0,t3_4kvbhh,As from what I know of his Essays and what I remember from French class I think hes an ENFP.If you dont know what his Essays are about theyre a long unfinished collection of his personnal opinions on various topics such as education politics religion and everything that relates to Man in a way or another in like several books. He also wrote about his friends such as his BFF tienne De La Botie or debates with other thinkers of his time all that in a very lyrical way.The thing is that the Essays werent intended to be a definitive work but a collection of thoughts he would edit several times until his death. It took  years to write the goddamn thing.So we can agree the guy has dominant Ne because he was open about a lot more than just philosophy or politics. He was into lewd jokes and bromance cared about colonization of America and had ideas about how to educate children etc.Why I think hes an ENFP rather than ENTP is the way he judged the world by his own subjectivity rather than collecting a certain amount of thoughts on a subject to make it a coherent worldview Fi opposed to Ti. Also he totally lost his shit when La Botie died which lead him to write the Essays to cope with the intellectual solitude as some Te attempt to fix the broken feelings through popular publication.The thing is dominant Ne types are hard to differentiate because they may act and think exactly the same. The difference is in the feelings ENFPs are more impulsive but uncertain about their own feelings whereas ENTPs are adventurous but careless about other peoples opinion sometimes to the extent of shocking them voluntarily.I could be so wrong at this point anyone with evidence of my mistakes can just throw me the whole Essays in the face.

7763825,0,t3_4ln5t6,I am not a practiced typer so take everything I say with a grain of salt. I think from interacting with ENTJs and being an ESTP with a weak P the biggest question that separates NT from ST IMO is are you more focused on the concept or on the application? The NTs I know tend to be more theoretical and abstract and can be very formulaic when putting plans into place. STs are more... Downtoearth and practical in putting plans into motion. They almost seem to have reverse problem solving procedures NTs take a model and apply it to a situation STs take a situation and construct a model. Thats not to say theres no research involved by STs though but it presents differently. STs tend to incorporate past experiences into their dataset for troubleshooting and build new constructs while NTs fit new information into constructs already in place from former experiences and often reinforce previously held beliefs. NJs are IMO more obstinate in their beliefs because their N likes to have its perceptions reinforced while SJs like to consume new information to plug into the equation. Js by nature seem very stubborn to me but NJs often moreso because they consider their constructs unassailable. SJs have their judgements but if its not relevant to the matter at hand they dont care to worry about it nearly as much. NJs cant stand being questioned whereas SJs will only really get annoyed about it if its a pressing matter.Again this might be somewhat informed by my P rather than your J. ,mbti,d3oopnz,2,t5_2s90r

Great speaking about how something bothers me combined with my flair is going to label me a covert narcissist.gtFear paralyzes me with anxiety when I think about everyone criticizing my PowerPoint presentation. Being highly sensitive is depressing and its not like public speaking is a walk in the park for introverts.You know who else feels like that? People who have experienced prolonged exposure to emotionally abusive environments. Where can a person be exposed to an emotionally abusive environment? When they have been raised by parents or in a longerterm relationship with a person who has a cluster B personality disorder  which includes narcissists.In the rraisedbynarcissists subreddit one of the things that is commonly discussed is fleas  behaviorsthought patternsetc that someone is now demonstrating that are the same as those of the person who abused them. Because if you live in an environment swarming with fleas you arent going to avoid getting at least some fleas on you. But as long as the person can be selfaware enough to recognize the behaviors and ultimately move away from them and exhibit healthy behaviors instead this person is not in danger of becoming a narcissist.Also worthy of note  the INFJ subreddit has a seeminglyhigh overlap with the RBN subreddit. Provided this bears out to the general populace I wish we had studies... is it really surprising then that INFJs are often characterized as expressing high levels of anxiety with publicspeaking or interaction when assuming they came from a clusterB experience no matter which option they chose they were wrong and punished for it?gtAs would be expected when covert narcissists show up in counseling they do not identify themselves are needing to change but seek help with managing how best to control and change others.And here is where you get the actual difference  intent. Either type of narcissist does not engage in critical introspection. And I dont think you can really say that as a whole INFJs do not engage there.,mbti,d3sj778,2,t5_2s90r

7823168,0,t3_4mf2z3,Now in your flair is says INTj.  Is that the Socionics denotation of INTP in MBTI or is that a typo meaning INTJ in MBTI?  They are two completely different types.  What you describe sounds more like Si and either Fi or Fe leaning more towards Fi  to me. Se doesnt get vibes about certain environments. That is Si.  Se gets at the surface level essence of the environment.  The Ni counterpart gets behind the surface but it has really not much to do with the environment.  Regardless your lowerlevel functions do not overdevelop. They overcompensate if anything.  If trauma is involved typing yourself correctly is going to be more difficult as this overcompensation is going to cloud your perception of yourself.  I think that INTJ is very unlikely from what youve written.  If you have to look for a way to alter the perception of half of the functions or half of a personality type to make them account for your individual experience such as claiming the ones that cant be overdeveloped are overdeveloped then you are trying to manipulate the data to fit the preconceived narrative.

But SiNe and NiSe may do a similar thing but go about it differently. SiNe may seek out to solve problems before they begin but their whole plan is not contingent on not having issues. An Ni perspective attempts to formulate a vision that will not even have problems in the first place.This leads me to understanding udolandump point a bit better they are right in that this is somewhat inaccurategtseek out opportunities to solve problems before they develop into something worseIts not that they seek opportunities to solve problems before they develop into something worse but more that they expect their vision to account for any potential issues in the first place.,mbti,d4txkt2,1,t5_2s90r

Though Im an American I have lived and studied in Europe and its amazing just how interconnected and interdependent those countries have become. Furthermore removing the Europes most important center of finance London from the European Union is not a smart decision as it could be usurped by either Paris or Frankfurt and its global influence could be diminished.  I think the ongoing economic troubles surrounding the Brexit are temporary but its worth noting that the Economy of California is currently larger than the Economy of the UK. A lot remains to be seen as to how the UK will move forward. They could negotiate similar deals as Norway and Switzerland and thus have access to both the common market and freedom of movement which I would consider a best case scenario at this point. This would likely require them to continue to accept immigrants from global crisis areas though which seemed to be the primary fuel behind the Brexit for a lot of voters. If the UK acts in a protectionist reactionary manner closing borders andor imposing any sort of trade restrictions it could be an unmitigated economic disaster for the UK and her citizens living and working in other European countries.I formed my opinion based on a history of having lived in Europe and also having a background in International Economics and Finance college level not practical or hands on. ,mbti,d4vusqo,2,t5_2s90r

8199547,0,t3_4rl9wy,I think people are not being charitable enough with their critique of your position and also attributing beliefs you may not hold i.e. Behaviorism. That being said I think your argument suffers from lack of clarity but more importantly is riddled with internal and external inconsistency. I will address your post point by point.gtOkay let me start off by saying I think mbti is very interesting but it has very many flawsWhat you mean here is NOT mbti but the theory of cognitive functions largely inspired by the works of Jung. Get your own position straight.gtFirst off why does can you have to introverted judging functions or even perceiving? Why cant someone have functions in any order. Okay as I understand you are asking two questions here. . What are the cognitive functions really?. What determines their specific ordering?These are good questions in themselves.gtI think people are way to vast and complex to break them down into only a certain arrange of the functions. Heres my example Why does an INTP have to be TiNeSiFe? Why cant it be TiNeFeSi? Then that wouldnt make them an INTP is what you would say? Well then what are they? Then we would need another type. You dont understand the functions! Youll say. This is what I take your first sentence to be saying people are complex beings they cannot be reduced to a sequence of cognitive functions. Okay but this can be interpreted in many ways lets see what you mean by following your example. Why is it that INTP correspond with TiNeSiFe and not something else? How are cognitive functions determined? Okay so you are NOT saying that the personality typing enterprise is hopeless because people are unique. You are merely stating it is not clear to you how the cognitive functions model work. Again this is a valid question but it is not an argument yet on why it is wrong.gtWell Ill let you know Ive took very many courses in fact during college I was very obsessed with MBTI. Its a year later now and lifes when on and Im settling down so I decided to look back into it to realize...it is so flawed. ParaphraseIm not a total retard. And the theory of cognitive function is flawed.First point is irrelevant to the issue at hand. Second point is just you restating your thesis.gtWhat Im trying to get across is that theres no way people only can have that certain stack of functions in that certain order. I know theres someone out there and by someone I mean millions of people who dont fit exactly into any specific order of functions. It just doesnt make logical sense when you think about it. Paraphrase There is no way people can be categorized into sequences of functions. There must be people that have unique sequences that do not conform to the established models. Okay this may be true but it doesnt undermine the theory. It merely states that the theory might not be able to account for exceptional cases GIVEN that these cases exist at all. This alone doesnt falsify the theory because  we do not know if these cases actually exist and  it might just mean the models need more categories not that the entire theory is false.gtHonestly typing by letter is more accurate the cognitive functions. I mean its very broad but the functions way of typing is way to specific. And its specific in the sense that it doesnt have more to it than you can be this but you cant be that. I can have Fe but heck no Im not allowed to have Te with it. Now me personally I do identify as an INTP. And I dove back into functions and realized hey thats really not how I amParaphrase I prefer typing by letter i.e. MBTI rather than the theory of cognitive functions. MBTI allows variance within types whereas cognitive functions seem to be absolute. To this I have to say this the theory of cognitive functions predates MBTI and is actually the father of MBTI. MBTI is merely the attempt to make the theory of cognitive functions easier to understand. It is not an alternate theory altogetherIn response to your question about absolutes. Neither MBTI nor the theory of cognitive functions explain ultimately WHY people are different. Both of them merely attempt to categorize HOW people are different. If you are looking for origin stories neither theories provide one. By this I mean questions like why are you INTP rather than ENTP is it because of genetics or environmental factors or what? gtMBTI tests like personalities are way more accurate than typing by functions. Its simple you are either something or you arent. Yeah its broad but functions have no fluidity to it. Its stagnant. And nobody is an exception. Whoever invented functions however really hit something but they were at a lack to consider how flexible and diverse people last brains are. Cmon I know some of you have took a test and scored higher on Te than Ti and higher than Fe than Fi and you were confused. What would you be? The answer is most likely none of the types by cognitive layout fit you. Functions need to be modified.MBTI is as rigid as the theory of cognitive functions. You are either INTP or you are not. You are either TiNeSiFe or you are not. Why is the ordering INTP and not NIPT or TNIP do these questions bother you? Also it is not clear what you mean by fluidity. With your reasoning about exceptions there can also be cases where a person cannot be typed into the MBTI categories but why is this not a problem for MBTI? Are you saying people cannot be categorized AT ALL? Or personality theories by their very nature discourages meaningful change in a persons life? Or are you merely restating it is not clear to you how cognitive functions are determined?gtIf I had the ability and resources to do it I would. But seriously if Im gonna support and believe in something it HAS to have logical consistency. Please everyone no hate this is my opinion if you disagree thats great Id love to hear your opinion but dont be hateful about it.If you cant see there is something wrong with cognitive typing you are insane.Okay from my understanding this is what you are trying to argue for A Theory of cognitive theory is flawed.B MBTI is better because it accounts for fluidity.But in reality you didnt argue for A. From what you wrote you merely raise these questions What are cognitive functions? What determines their specific ordering? And how are they specifically related to MBTI? You are seeking clarification not saying anything about the correctness of the theory. Your first internal inconsistency lies here because you were insightful enough to anticipate our reaction to your argument. gtYou dont understand the functions! Youll say.Everything about your posts points to the conclusion that you really dont understand. Your second internal inconstancy is you try to argue for why MBTI is better by enlisting THE EXACT REASON why you think the theory of cognitive function is flawedgt functions way of typing is way to specific. And its specific in the sense that it doesnt have more to it than you can be this but you cant be that.ampnbspgt MBTI tests like personalities are way more accurate than typing by functions. Its simple you are either something or you arent.With regards to B It is not entirely clear what you mean by fluidity. I take it to mean that the theories dont take in to account change across time for people or people cannot be reduced to a limited number of psychological types. This is an argument that can be made against ANY theory of personality but I take it that this is NOT what you are arguing for because you still believe in MBTI.ampnbspThe main problem is that you dont seem to understand that the two theories dont compete with each other they complement each other and are deeply interconnected. The finer points of cognitive functions can be further debated clarified and developed but that is not to say the theory is fundamentally flawed as you would like us to believe. I think you raise good questions but you dont actually present a coherent argument with regards to your original thesis that the theory of cognitive functions is utterly wrong. ampnbspYou need to work on reducing grammatical errors clearly define the concepts you are presenting and writing out an argument that is logically consistent. I dont think you are an idiot I really dont. But you make it easy for people to draw that conclusion from the way you write.,mbti,d52hwoc,6,t5_2s90r

8289816,0,t1_d5dqq73,Well I mean thats not enough information to determine that. You seem to have to have previous knowledge on a subject to understand it which is Si. Does this generally apply to youIntroverted Sensing often involves storing data and information then comparing and contrasting the current situation with similar ones.The immediate experience or words are instantly linked with the prior experiences and we register a similarity or a differencefor example noticing that some food doesnt taste the same or is saltier than it usually is.Introverted Sensing is also operating when we see someone who reminds us of someone else.Sometimes a feeling associated with the recalled image comes into our awareness along with the information itself. Then the image can be so strong our body responds as if reliving the experience. The process also involves reviewing the past to draw on the lessons of history hindsight. If that does then yes I would say you most likely use Si. ,mbti,d5dsauv,1,t5_2s90r

8417998,0,t3_4uxlp6,Before you take this into consideration know that from what Ive found the best way to find out your type or what functions you use is to just think about it yourself and come to a conclusion which took me forever or simply ask the people who know you well what they think. If youre lucky enough to know someone who has read about or knows enough about mbti to type you seriously take what they say into consideration if not then just ask someone if you fit a certain behaviour or act a certain way that aligns to a type or function. Anyway from just reading this I originally was thinking Ti user paired maybe with Se? As I read on I got the feeling you were an introverted feeler and having finished I would say youre an ISFP. I didnt see any use of Te or Si in what you said and so I ruled out ISTJ and ESTJ and ISFJ and ESFJ felt unlikely. Although you seem to trust your gut feeling I think this is coming from the use of Se rather than Ni so that made me less confident in you being an INTJ or ENTJ. Also your need to object against what others say made me feel more confident in you being an Fi user and less confident in you using Fe so just to limit the options I cut out INFJ and ENFJ. Amongst other reasons what made me chose Se over Ne which Im still not overtly confident about was that you seem to be interested in what you could be doing as an activity with your friends. Overall you seem to be more focused on your own world if only a little and this also led me to chose introversion. As for whether or not youre a thinking type I would think you arent because you clearly a use Fi a lot and you seem seem to be a lot more emotionally fuelled. So thats how I arrived at you being an ISFP. Once again this is just what I got from this I dont know you at all so this could really be wrong and I recommend you simply look over this yourself.

This study examined the accuracy of observers impressions on  personality traits based on fullbody photographs using criterion measures based on self and peer reports. When targets posture and expression were constrained standardized condition observers judgments were accurate for extraversion selfesteem and religiosity. When targets were photographed with a spontaneous pose and facial expression spontaneous condition observers judgments were accurate for almost all of the traits examined.Socionics simply doesnt close their eyes to this knowledge.

8482487,0,t1_d61tokg,No its not like that. There isnt any loss of awareness its the opposite. Its like a form of metacognition I guess you could say. Due to the nature of Ni and it being dominant its always taking in whats around you and internalizing it. Ni never stops working ever whether conscious or unconscious so youre always absorbing everything around you and unconsciously mulling it over. This results in this constant weird feeling of being aware whether you mean to be or not. For me its like Im watching a movie in my head except the movie is what Im seeingfeelingsensing etc.,mbti,d61ut3t,8,t5_2s90r
8488414,0,t1_d62izs2,I spend a lot of time inside my head and wonder what Ill do or where Ill be in say a few years time. I need to have goals in order to motivate myself and starting from an idea I can pretty much picture in my head how it will develop and if it feels right thats my next goal. I just know its right and its what I need to do. I rely a lot on my gut feelings.I also like to find new ways to get to a certain conclusion as in I like doing things my way almost skipping steps because I already know where Im going Im so focused on the final goal that I might forget important details here and there.Practical example when solving a Maths problem sometimes I find it hard to follow the standard steps because I look at it individually like I dont think this is x type of situation so I have to do y and find an alternative solution. The good thing is that I can face new problems relatively easily the downside is that sometimes I can ignore something that was right in front of me because I was too focused on doing things my way.I dont know if I have explained it well probably not it wasnt an easy question and at this point Im not even sure if thats Ni or something else.,mbti,d62lk93,2,t5_2s90r

Your friend also seems more active in terms of wanting to take care of people while INFJs are usually more passive.I can see how she might think she is an introvert if she has social anxiety and depression  on my worst days with anxiety I feel like an introvert. Shes like me in that while we avoid certain social scenarios we are still always ready to socialise and connect with other even new! people.I can also relate to the whole wears her heart on her sleeve yet no one really truly knows all her struggles thing.

8559172,0,t1_d6bf8oy,Democratic socialism is most certainly socialism. The means of production are owned and operated democratically and resources are distributed through nonmarket means with or without money involved. Generally socialists reject market economics and the concept of money as most see no need for its existence.Social democracy is a form of capitalism with heavy restrictions on businesses and redistribution of wealth. Free healthcare education and relaxed social policies are staples of the ideology. Its known mainly for being practiced in countries like Denmark Sweden and Norway which can afford to spend so much government money since they dont have to upkeep a military. All these nations are capitalist though and benefit heavily from international trade.Bernie Sanders is also a social democrat which should not be confused with democratic socialism as they are fundamentally different things.,mbti,d6bh1p9,3,t5_2s90r

Instead I would offer a response like Healthy is a pretty subjective idea but a healthy INTP would probably be confident motivated know when and how to pull through on their ideas and understand that feelings are data too.From my limited experience with ISFPs I would say for a start that a healthy one ought to know how to deal productively with criticism and be mindful of longterm consequences when making decisions.

Se and Ne both can look similar so its easier to look at what they are paired with.Because you feel you could somewhat relate to Ni but not Si you likely use Se and Ni. ESFP seems like a good fit. This type leads with Se a function you felt strongly about and has Ni as inferior function function you felt was reasonable but not as strong hence inferior function.ESFP Se Fi Te NiIf you feel that strongly about Ne you should look into how Si works as an inferior function in ENFPs and see if it fits.

8696167,0,t3_4z3o53,In a word no.While you might argue that QM makes the universe nondeterministic at the atomic scale in certain ways the probabilities functions are deterministic. Cognition operates at a scale macroscopic to the underlying quantum processes and as a result is far more subject to the probabilities and statistical mechanics wrapping them up more than the individual events themselves. And since the trajectory of the statistical mechanics is actually predictable and the probabilities are very tightly determined cognition itself and other macroscopic things could be said to operate on rails. I mean we dont see really any other dense macroscopic systems really behaving in ways that are not statistically explicable even though they are all quantumbased.And its not like we have some way of enmasse manipulating quantum outcomes in a way that could cohesively produce a different cognitive result than the natural progression would realize.Im INTP.,mbti,d6sngtp,2,t5_2s90r

Im pretty rigid in my thinking so its hard to make my thinking change of direction. I can open one or two rivers at the same time and manage them even though i know its a somewhat rare ability.I can search for an idea while Im making my sentence or listen to someone else for example. But Im more limited in my multitasking than what Im describing here.Im someone brutally honest and genuine but the brutal school environment taught me how to deceive and lie. It was a matter of social survival for me. So I learned to wear made up personas. They are quite limited  its just basic mindset I prepare so Ill deliver a tone thats adapted in the situation I am half genuine just a lot filtered. I choose my social filter consciously as I havent the ability managing them without thinking. Its both expensive in term of energy cost ant inefficient  sharp people can tell when I come as artificial and how I thought out what I said before passing it through filters.All that lets virtually no room for being intruded or lose the track of my thinking  I check it constantly from upstream to downstream.Your example of friend crush  I dont know what a crush is. I can lust on someone but thats something I got in check quite early.I love deeply and calmly  I check my loved ones well being by long intervals caring mostly about what is meaningful to them and on what they struggle. I usually only propose myself to help if I know I can give a hand for their issues. Same for friends. Im not present often to have to worry about misplaced caring.

9025008,0,t3_53sxqx,gtDescribe your inner world.There are so many ideas floating around so many possibilities and hypothetical scenarios Ive thought of. Bestworst case scenarios for everything many in extensive detail. Youll find everything I wish was in picture frames hanging on a wall in a room full of everything that is. At my best Im creative imaginative resourceful and energized by the idea of creating something new. At my worst Im neurotic devoid of confidence perpetually dismayed by the world around me and by my inability to finish things that I start.As Ive grown the rosetinted glasses have come off. I know Ill probably never be a rock star and that I cant be great at everything I try. I know that my natural aptitude for things isnt always going to cut it anymore and trying to reconcile that is a constant struggle. But in turn Ive started focusing on being less selfcentered and more concerned with the people around me. I no longer have these childlike ambitions I just want to be a kind person and my only real goal is for my name to outlive me. I just want to do something that matters to someone. I want to be wellrounded and value wisdom over knowledge I suppose you could say.But theres this constant cloud looming over my inner world and its my struggle with feeling like I dont have a place in the external world. I have no real goals I dont care much about money and I dont care for what are decidedly American values working hard climbing the ladder making a good living being assertive what have you. And yet here I am with a bachelors degree working a job that I like but cant stand being at for  hours a week. So Im perpetually caught between my own idealized inner world and whats actually around me. Its a struggle to be myself without being selfish or detached from the world.gtWhat excites you?Having a chance to express myself freely without being judged. Having people look at what I create and say I totally get that. Inspiring people. Feeling like I am in fact doing something right while Im also doing something I enjoy and believe in. Starting new creative projects. Finding music that speaks to me in a way that nothing has before. People appreciating not just my actions but my intentions and motivations.

9441929,0,t1_d9cph02,Yes actually I do understand that. First of all to even start a discussion over whether something is good or bad you first have to agree that those distinctions actually exist only then can the discussion take place. One of my favorite debate topics with some of my atheist colleagues including one that is a moral nihilist is whether the concept of morality even exists without an objective source of right vs. wrong. I usually take the position that without an objective source the entire concept of rightwrong doesnt hold water. However once you agree that right and wrong exist then you must acknowledge under what ethical framework are you judging the actions. Once you have committed to an ethical framework then an action is no longer neutral.  Most people assume that right and wrong exist and unconsciously judge actions based on an a sometimes entirely unconscious ethical framework.,mbti,d9ctxwi,1,t5_2s90r

9538370,0,t1_d9osfxf,Well to be fair her language choices arent awesome at least in my view in the part I read most closely. And too the whole topic of mistyping can get kind of fraught. Especially with that thing I mentioned in my second note in the OP about people assigning some sort of hierarchical value to different kinds of information processing rather than looking at it more descriptively. And I feel like the language in the article could easily be read either way so it could be that this is frustrating or upsetting to some people.Also its that thoughtcatalog person and she has a reputation for ... I guess I would call it lack of rigor? in her stuff so theres that.All of that said though I found some descriptive value in the one related to my type. Like for example this part seems quite useful to megtWhile the INFP is wildly imaginative and speculative the INFJ is significantly more grounded in reality  they want to know the future whereas the INFP wants to invent it.gtHowever because so many INFPs identify as INFJs it perpetuates the stereotype that INFJs are idealistic dreamers. While the INFJ does often get lost in their thoughts their thoughts do not mirror the imaginative fantasies of the INFP type  they are more often considering how various courses of events are likely to play out in an attempt to narrow down which one is most likely to happen and how they ought to plan for it accordingly. And too  While I dont really like emotional as a way to talk about the Jungian feeling functions Fi and Fe I feel like there is a huge difference in the INFJs detachment from and often confusion about our own judgingbased perspectives how we individually feel about something and if IXFP mistypes affect type descriptions that confusiondetachment gets really lost.

I can relate to  of those things but even though the third one doesnt fit me Id mainly focus on the things that do fit.If I look at Cancer sensitive sentimental and protecting I can again see qualities that fit me sentimental and protecting. And in that way you can find and relate to qualities in every astrological combination of moon signs sun signs and God knows what kind of other signs.If  of the people can relate to their sign then the  of people that cant relate are going to be less relevant in the general accuracy of it all.

The higher up in the function stack the easier it is to make these connections.With ENxPs these connections come naturally. It is not that its easy for them to make these connections its that these connections are made by default. This is why its so hard to explain Ne ideas is because were not always consciously making them.For ENxPs it can be difficult to process some of these irrational perceptions into the realm of rational judgements through their Auxiliary Ji and even more difficult to illustrate them through Tertiary Je.In laymans terms Ne doms create ideas faster than they can translate them into rational thoughts and explain them.

What kinds of things do you usually forget?gtMy memories are mostly triggered by the external world. For example a topic or an object reminds me of something else that gave me an impression. I get cringe attacks often as well. I am really bad at remembering practical things like faces names birthdays and instructions for practicalities.C. What kind of people do you feel most comfortable around? What kind of people make you feel awkward or uncomfortable? What kind of people annoy you the most?gtMost comfortable are people who are imaginative and easy to talk to . Insightful and easy going people who give good advice are good too.gtLeast comfortable are people who are unpredictably touchy. I dont like nitpickers or overly bossy people as well. I dont really get along very well with people who focus on looks even if they are nice because we dont feel like we are on the same page when we talk.D. How do you usually handle interpersonal conflict or confrontation? How do you wish you handled it  what would you change about your usual approach if you wanted to improve?Feel free to give examples if its helpful.gtTo be honest I would run away from the problem. I could have made a compromise or if it was my fault apologise. The anxiety to approach people was mostly to blame.E. What is your demeanor like?gtMy face is somewhat expressive and my move my hands and try to draw out what I am talking about. Otherwise I am not really expressive in accurately conveying my emotions.gtI am not usually talkative people have told me that I am too quiet and need to speak louder. When I talk I can forget what I was going to say and end up saying never mind and my speech is hard to follow because I talk tangentially. I am more of a listener wanting to know how others think or feel about something and getting a general consensus better to listen first to understand the topic better. gtI get bored easily but rarely fidgety coffee does make me do that this can be easily curbed by reddit and youtube. I feel lethargic and unproductive often and it worries me a little especially if I have responsibilities to do like homework and it just stays there in my mind all day. gtI can be both goofy and serious and sometimes in inappropriate situations.

What kinds of things do you seem to notice more than most people? What do you more often seem to miss?gtHow I seem to other people are a mystery to me. Im not good at peoplereading either or being completely aware my current surroundings and lose things often as well. I do notice certain things in my environment that I found interesting like how a large spider is usually in that specific bush. Sometimes I can see when a persongroup is malicious but it takes a lot of consideration before I make a decision to ditch them.G. Think about your energy interest level and skill doing various activities. What energizes you relaxes you stresses you out? What do you do well okay or poorly? What can you do all day for a while only in short bursts or barely at all? Which of these seem like a waste of time not just for you but in general?gtI do draw a lot and look up on tutorials and references on drawing it is relaxing when I feel bored and alone. I tend to daydream a lot and brainstorm a story from my mind attempting to make it sound coherent in my head.gtI like reading weird manga like Junji Ito. It is so surreal and creepy but I couldnt help but try to make sense from the madness even if it is intended to have no meaning at all and reading theories from other readers. I gravitate towards visual media more and can get lazy on reading huge chunks of text and listening from audiobooks.gtOften I will explore reddit and vaguely type about personal problems in the search bar and see if anyone experiences how I felt. Most of the time it does show up but I would take most of the suggestions a bit more than a grain of salt. I get to look at pretty interesting life stories as well. gtI become bored by trying to put in effort in my appearance and trying to fit in.

9810357,0,t1_damarg9,Just to add on because its easy for the things you said to be misunderstood as Fe or perhaps a higher Fi placement You say youre not good at offering sympathy because you feel its fake and youd rather offer advice. This is very much an NT preference wanting to fix a problem and believing youll help a person most in the long run by solving it rather than giving them a short term ego bandaid. Its because with Fi that you recognize your own feelings and then through Ni pattern recognition and Te simple effective logic we generally arrive at the golden rule naturally treat others as you would wish yourself to be treated. We overestimate how much we care about people instead focusing on the ones that actually matter to us having a rather shallow feigned interest in strangers usually but otherwise abiding by our rule which gives us a rather flat politeness. We are capable of being not as oblivious to the emotional atmosphere as other TeFi types because we can sort of improvise again via Ni pattern recognition. Basically through long term experience we gain emotional intelligence by picking up on the cues of people. So its not our inclination to naturally detect the emotional atmosphere its more so a hunch like any other we get like hmm everyone seems bored... Of course with limited social experience were just as clueless as the others. And well still have gaps in our knowledge and a heavy reluctance to follow social rituals. Of course I could be entirely wrong on all of this.,mbti,damc4mc,6,t5_2s90r
9827224,0,t3_5g0lac,What is it you think that typology is? Its not supposed to model reality exactly. Its certainly not a science. Its a heuristic tool originally created by Jung for practical psychotherapy and adapted by Myers for getting women into the work force. Its usefulness comes from its elegant simplicity and general apparent validity the MBTI scales correlate heavily with four of the Big  scales which where created decades later and are considered the gold standard of psychometrics!.That functions are ordered in a certain way come from A Jungs observations over the course of his clinical career and B certain philosophical presuppositions in particular the tension of the opposites yin and yang. More of one thing means comparatively less of its opposite thats basically analytically true true by definition.And you shouldnt dismiss inconsistencies. You should observe them carefully see if the issue is with the model your interpretation of the model or your observation and work it accordingly. I mean you can throw up your hands and give up if you like but thats on you.Im also curious about your thoughts on religion. I think a common fallacy is that the bible and other religions were attempts to explain the natural world same as people do with typology. Science explains things but not everything should be held to the same standards of science because not everything is there to explain the natural world. The scientific mindset only read came into being a few hundred years ago. I think religion is a guide to morality and spirituality to being. Its a valid interpretation that the stories are metaphors. Id recommend Jordan Peterson Joseph Campbell and Jung himself for a fascinating perspective on this.,mbti,daoibif,3,t5_2s90r
9844143,0,t1_daq0rgr,You suggested that we lump all of those posts into one weekly thread. I mean sure its a really practical solution. But it reduces visibility drastically and even more so when people learn to ignore the sticky thread because its always the same one stickied. So how are people supposed to not feel like that reduces the importance of their personal struggles?Personal anecdote I was a mod for a music sub for a while and one thing we had a problem with for a bit as it grew was people constantly posting their own bands. We tried a mega thread and also a dedicated day for posting small artists. People learned to ignore it. The only people engaging those threads were a select few who really cared about finding small unknown bands and so it really ended up feeling less like a solution and more like it was marginalizing those artists. There had been more engagement  and more authentic engagement  when people were allowed to post their own threads the way they wanted rather than be buried in a single thread that no one wanted to look at.What did eventually help things was when people started coming up with more creative discussion threads and more engaging ones. It balanced things and spaced out the check out my band posts so that when those threads came up they didnt become a constant that people would learn to ignore.anecdoteSo my point you first suggested the above but you also suggested that the presence of all those depression threads just feeds depression. Dont INFPs want validation? Is the commiseration in itself not a big part of what helps us feel less like theres something wrong with us? Thats why so many people dont see it as a problem.The problem wasnt that people in rINFP didnt want change but that you proposed a solution that while it certainly would cut down the noise would ultimately toss peoples struggles aside into a thread that people would eventually forget existed and abandon outright when they realized no one was reading it beyond a few who really care to check it. If you want to change the climate of the sub you need to do so gradually and steadily by introducing new discussion that engages people and gives room to breathe in between people reaching out for help or venting. Sweeping peoples depression threads under the mega thread rug isnt going to change anything in the long run.,mbti,daqpqw6,1,t5_2s90r

Its a word that he made up so no one is exactly sure what it means but the best guess based on its context and apparent root words is that it refers to child molestation practices in newly organized churches. The world homosexual was never added to the bible until the earlymid twentieth century with the rise of eugenics combined with fundamentalism.The only time Jesus himself says anything about it is when he talks about how marriage between a man and a woman is the greatest way to honor God. The thing is right after that verse and most people leave this out he says that this rule does not apply to eunichs whether born that way who are made that way or who chose to be in the service of God.The catch here is that eunich is a bit of a fishy translation. In english it implies a male without his genitalia but in Greek it applied to anyone who did not practice heatero sex ei homosexuals. Id say those who are born eunuchs pretty distinctly excuses the LGBT community for not following old testament marriage standards.Im sorry I cant site verses for you I dont have all my resources on me at the moment but there are plenty of antihomo evangelical websites that can point you to all of the verses Im referring to!  ,mbti,daytdkz,3,t5_2s90r

The are as it were only Galtonesque familyportraits which sum up in a cumulative image the common and therefore typical characters stressing these disproportionately while the individual features are just as disproportionately effaced. Accurate investigation of the individual case consistently reveals the fact that in conjunction with the most differentiated function another function of secondary importance and therefore of inferior differentiation in consciousness is constantly present and is a  relatively determining factor....gt Experience shows that the secondary function is always one whose nature is different from though not antagonistic to the leading function  thus for example thinking as primary function can readily pair with intuition as auxiliary or indeed equally well with sensation but as already observed never with feeling. Neither intuition nor sensation are antagonistic to thinking i.e. they have not to be unconditionally excluded since they are not like feeling of similar nature though of opposite purpose to thinking  for as a judging function feeling successfully competes with thinking  but are functions of perception affording welcome assistance to thought.,mbti,dbg9pjq,2,t5_2s90r

I completely overlooked how etchings and paintings usually try to portray in a very nuanced way the person who commissioned the works subjective sense of self or what ever propaganda needed to be pushed within the context of the era. I suppose that would be what youre getting at?Its really not a big deal about the sectioning off of genderexclusive examples and use of pronouns when putting the writings in the context of the time they were written and by who so it might have been by no conscious fault OPs own as she stated.Anyway if youre up to it go ahead and attempt Kiersey despite peoples apprehensions. A lot of the more discerning iNtuitives here raise their brow to it thankfully. I got about  to  pages in before I put it on the backburner. I might revisit at some point.

10374442,0,t1_dcjfhdw,My first guess when by your wording of the post was INTP. I find it very unlikely for you to be an S by how you answered my first question. Your hierarchy of the idea of significance makes me think you are a J.By your third answer Im going to lean toward I instead of E.Im pretty convinced still youre a T by how you choose your wording.Therefore my new guess is INTJ. That would make sense too because it would make your function stack NiTe. Introverted Intuition is my auxiliary function as an ENFJ. Te likes to be in charge or in control and the way you very matteroffactly said type me makes me also more convinced youre a T and not an F.  Howd I do?

10387099,0,t3_5orc39,Hey there! I think your friend is definitely an NT  Ill explain a little what my reasoning is. The N would be that hes more of a bigpicture sort of person ex. having a plan for the future thinking hes above peoplewhats happening in the here and now insensitiveselfish FPS games. The T is also pretty obvious it seems like he doesnt really care about anyone else and hes not in touch with his own feelings either. As for the other two letters Im not entirely sure. He sounds a lot like an INTJ I used to be friends with especially with his attitude towards a lot of his friends like he is just with them for utility and doesnt care about them as people it feels like he could just drop everyone and not even care. That INTJ seemed kinda unhealthy as well for similar reasons was very good with people but despised all of them really good manipulator had everyone convinced he was this genius sociopath.I have a couple questions that may help sort out the last two letters  what is his happy place? Where does he feel most relaxed and in his element? Is he an effective person? Does he follow through and accomplish the things he wants to accomplish? Does he start projects and then abandon them when he gets bored?,mbti,dclfxse,2,t5_2s90r

10411271,0,t1_dcnvchv,Thank you for your analysis. I think this all makes sense. My reservation about ESTP was SeI relate to Ne much better. If the expectation is sitting down and taking in sensory things without doing anything else that sounds pretty boring to me. And your comment about Se users not wanting to talk if they dont want to talk definitely resonates with me. I know an ESFP and Ive always been amused by how hes more straightforwardly socially extroverted than me but can be considerably less talkative. Especially if its just him and me Ill do the majority of the talking making random observations and jokes while he listens and laughs. Yet in large groups hes the center of attention and loves it.,mbti,dco6odb,1,t5_2s90r

10996897,0,t3_5wu1s9,I am an ISTJ through and through. Ive taken all kinds of tests and always come up as a strong ISTJ. Im often mistaken as uncaringyielding because I use logical thinking and reason to make decisions and always try to follow rules even with family and friends. And I am also mistaken for not having a good time because I am often quiet but that is because I am taking everything in. All thats being said and not said. And from that trying to discern the best course of action or inaction. When I am around my family or close friends I am almost extroverted because I feel comfortable around them. I am also like my type because I hate being put on the spot. Asking me to come up with something this instant is literally the worst. I need time to think and plan so that I am comfortable in whatever Im doing. Im an ISTJ in that the most important things to be are honesty and loyalty. And that I hold myself and others to a pretty high standard. But behind the scenes I feel and love intensely its just difficult to show it at times. I do better showing it by my actions doing something for that person or buying them something rather than saying it. I think I am unlike some ISTJs because I can seem extraverted when necessary job interviews job meetings etc. And I also dont like being alone alone too often.

Familial and other types of social support barring leadership support weirdly enough  noted in first link are actually very strong indicators of reduced suicide attempts in transgender individuals.

A lot of research points to social support and trauma as indicators against and for suicide attempts and that transitioning is one of the most effective treatments.

They still have extroverted judging but its second to their Ni. Whereas an INTP would have Ti dom Ne second.

Apart from that as a typical INTP I suppose this is more a matter of theory and abstract which I am applying to reality. gt Rigid ideological beliefs about what the experienced reality is would be more characteristic of a Jidom eg a mistyped INFP. Or well people like Ghandi Marin Luther King and also sorry to say Hitler Trotsky and Mugabe all of which were INFJs and also had rigid ideological beliefs. INFJs are just as prone to this as INFPs if not more so cause its based on Ni combined with Fe. I mean Ni is bad enough when its primary combined with Te but combined with Fe it means the beliefs wont exactly be rational and may well be stubbornly held. People think INFPs are the most ideologically stubborn of the types because of Fi but they forget that Ne is like the most open minded function. Neither Ni or Fe facilitate open mindedness.

11206650,0,t3_5zw5e1,Dont get too caught up in the stereotypos. They have some truth because people with the same cognitive pipeline tend to act in similar ways but  that can confuse how a type is perceived with how they really are. The function stack is where youre going to find understanding.Every human being has two basic systems for processing the world perceiving and judging. Sensing and  Intuition are the major components of the perceiving system which filters and organizes information and projects possibilities. Thinking and Feeling are the major components of the judging system which handles choices. Function stack describes the hierarchy or order in which a person sends information back and forth through these systems and the ie attitude designation describes how theyre connected to each other a persons worldview and the actions they take. The attitude part can get complicated and requires a decent amount of background before it actually clicks. The judging system is simple compared to the perceiving system and is concentrated in a relatively small number of specific areas in the brain. So lets start there.Thinking and Feeling are essentially evolved decisionmaking strategies. Each has its benefits and its drawbacks and we all need and use both. Thinking is a logic based processes focused on consistency and effectiveness. It is calorically expensive slow and inefficient with processing space but relatively impervious to error. Feeling is an emotion based strategy that relies on substitution and intensity matching. It is fast  efficient  and calorically cheap but tends to regularly make certain mistakes by swapping a tough question with an easier one. For example If asked do we save sea slugs or dolphins? the Feeler will often swap to an easier question and instead answer the question which of these is more cute and makes fuzzy good feelings? while the thinker might look up the ecosystem and say saving the ugly one has a good chance of saving the dolfins along with everything else living there so do that.The Thinking type simply prefers to make its decisions based on the logical consistency or effectiveness of something while the feeling type tends to make its decisions based on the relative goodbad pleasurepain easyhard criteria of two options. Feelings fast  low cost decisions can save your behind in situations where Thinking can get you dead or too much time passing might mean the loss of what you value  but it does leave something to be desired when it comes to the longterm.As you grow you find that one works best in your personal situation and you begin to rely on that one and only use the other when your goto cant come to a conclusion. The neural wiring to your preference and from your preference to your backup grows strong and thick and eventually gels into a permanent fixture of your personality.To say feeling types are kind gentle souls is to fundamentally misunderstand. A Feeler can be a selfish arrogant manipulative monster but because of the way Feeling works many if not most will tend to be kind and emotionally sensitive.Sensing and Intuition have a similar dichotomy but are a bit more complex in what they do... and this is getting long so Ill stop for now. If that helps and you want me to get into the perceiving system attitudes or function interactions lemme know. ,mbti,df29e6v,1,t5_2s90r

Theyll pause and space out for a moment and then come back knowing exactly where theyre going with their answer. This is really easy to spot in interviews since theres a lot of questions.

11367737,0,t1_dfkgmzx,gt The generalattitude types as I have pointed out more than once are differentiated by their particular attitude to the object. The introverts attitude to the object is an abstracting one at bottom he is always facing the problem of how libido can be withdrawn from the object as though an attempted ascendancy on. the part of the object had to be continually frustrated. The extravert on the contrary maintains a positive relation to the object. To such an extent does he affirm its importance that his subjective attitude is continually being orientated by and related to the object. An fond the object can never have sufficient value for him therefore its importance must always be paramount. gt The relation between subject and object considered biologically is always a relation of adaptation since every relation between subject and object presupposes mutually modifying effects from either side. These modifications constitute the adaptation. The typical attitudes to the object therefore are adaptation processes. Nature knows two fundamentally different ways of adaptation which determine the further existence of the living organism the one is by increased fertility accompanied by a relatively small degree of defensive power and individual conservation the other is by individual equipment of manifold means of selfprotection coupled with a relatively insignificant fertility. This biological contrast seems not merely to be the analogue but also the general foundation of our two psychological modes of adaptation At this point a mere general indication must suffice on the one hand I need only point to the peculiarity of the extravert which constantly urges him to spend and propagate himself in every way and on the other to the tendency of the introvert to defend himself against external claims to conserve himself from any expenditure of energy directly related to the object thus consolidating for himself the most secure and impregnable position. gt Now when the orientation to the object and to objective facts is so predominant that the most frequent and essential decisions and actions are determined not by subjective values but by objective relations one speaks of an extraverted attitude. When this is habitual one speaks of an extraverted type. If a man so thinks feels and acts in a word so lives as to correspond directly with objective conditions and their claims whether in a good sense or ill he is extraverted. His life makes it perfectly clear that it is the objective rather than the subjective value which plays the greater role as the determining factor of his consciousness. He naturally has subjective values but their determining power has less importance than the external objective conditions.gt The introverted attitude is normally governed by the psychological structure theoretically determined by heredity but which to the subject is an ever present subjective factor. This must not be assumed however to be simply identical with the subjects ego an assumption that is certainly implied in the above mentioned designations of Weininger it is rather the psychological structure of the subject that precedes any development of the ego. The really fundamental subject the Self is far more comprehensive than the ego because the former also embraces the unconscious while the latter is essentially the focal point of consciousness. Were the ego identical with the Self it would be unthinkable that we should be able to appear in dreams in entirely different forms and with entirely different meanings. But it is a characteristic peculiarity of the introvert which moreover is as much in keeping with his own inclination as with the general bias that he tends to confuse his ego with the Self and to exalt his ego to the position of subject of the psychological process thus effecting that morbid subjectification of consciousness mentioned above which so alienates him from the object.In these passages he makes the distinction clear between the theoretical model of the subjectobject and that of the real world the ego i.e. people. They are independent processes.,mbti,dfkieoi,2,t5_2s90r

11414035,0,t3_62tzd5,OHH DEAR here goes. Anyone who stalks me will reach this post and find out all my deepest secrets... sigh  I am  Female. Im Chinese Malaysian. I am a gamer. I like psychology. I identify as a Liberal. I am an Atheist. I am currently in treatment for Dysthymia A type of Depression. I like to deal with people. I talk about education a lot lately with my family. I advocate for equality in most ways I can. I love anime and manga I love consuming the medium and discussing about it. I am passionate about that. I can play several instruments as I have played for more than  years. I speak  languages and have some basics in Linguistics. I know a lot of random topics therefore when I talk to others I have multitudes of interest from religion literature sex mental health popculture latest news political  thoughtsopinions Philosophy Science specially Astronomy Technology and especially Culture. I like performance arts and I used to do them frequently. I like cosmetics and selfexpression  I sometimes want to be a goth. I like educational channels on YouTube! I LOVE rock music and Jpop. I think thats most of it demographically.  ENFP. I am generally idealistic. I am easy going but I try not to be a sheep because my automation is what makes exactly me. Everything can make me think and learn. I can sit at a bus stop and start looking at trees and wonder how long they had to grow. Then I think about the people who sweeps the dry leaves and how much their wages are. I wonder where they come from and how did they land up in their jobs. I wonder how many people they need to do that jobs. I wonder if its enough for them to feed themselves and whether they have families. It goes on. Why? Because I want to know them and its fun for me to have a basis to go on and I dont mind realigning them to reality when I have the chance to. I generally can interpret words actual meaning but I can still hit and miss. I believe I do it better than most people when it comes to reading between the lines however that is completely lost when it comes to analysing literature.  I make very far connections when it comes to conversations. It would jump from one thing to another quite quickly. I am not very creative when I need to be super creative but I believe thats because I havent been really creating other than writing short stories and talking random shenannegans with friends on voice chat. I could be however very creative at finding ways to do a routine  brush teeth clean things up whatever. I associate these with NeSi.   I prefer if I can express myself. I say that but I do not tell people my pain. Sometimes I dont dare to tell people what I really think because in order to have a solid opinion I needed to construct it objectively in words or text. They need to be complete and indestructable and I can stand against it. When I cant stand against it I will accept I need to learn something. But this all crumbles if I know I will not  have acceptance. I do not respond well to disagreement but I am trying to improve on that by gaining more selfconfidence. When I am not understood the way I want I give up I give up easier when I was younger and leave the conversation. I will have decided this person is not worth convincing because I am not heard. I want to be heard but Im also bad at diplomacy. I have so much more to do if I want to be able to express myself and accept I wont be accepted all the time.  I am mostly curious but more about people and what they do and think. Its easier for me to ask why to strangers because when I ask why to someone I know it feels intrusive.  I associate these with FiTe.  I am generally outgoing and not shy from strangers but when it is a large group setting I have found value of sitting back and let others speak first and talk. However in my more natural state as a child I wouldnt hesitate to volunteer anything as long as I can  my thoughts my action my work. I like to be with people and I feel sad when theyre gone. I dont like to return home early because I cant bear choosing to leave a crowd. I associate these with Extraversion. Therefore with NeSi and FiTe I am ENFP.  Reason why I posted here was because I keep thinking Im INFP but I know my Te is more developed than Si. So your help is appreciated.    It means my selfassessment is correct therefore I can work on improving my weakness and achieve my goals. I want to be a wellrounded selfactualised individual that brings influence to people in a large scale.   Make a song about me? And sing it? I would probably make an Anime OP with fancy graphic pfft as if or a WWE theme song for myself cuz its funny heuehuheu.  At child stage to  I am often unable to express myself in a constructive way therefore I do not express it at all. I also didnt know how to make friends and that with not being thin gave me a lot of hurdles when it comes to that. Teachers often think I am not disciplined and lazy when it comes to Maths. The fact is I didnt really understand and it was hard for me. The reaction for it being hard was deflection and avoidance and therefore I get punished. Once I started to not gain confidence I want less to do with it. All I wanted was the adults to teach me the way I can understand and help me with putting work into it. I disliked Maths until adulthood until I dated a Mathematician. I also do not respond well to rules. The more I am asked of something the less likely I want to do it. It was the loss of freedomautomation. I was very rebellious ever since I start school. Punishments might help but comes with resentment. As an adult I am often misunderstood as someone cold because of my more developedTe. I speak with less warmth and diplomacy and often straightforward its a doubleedged sword. I do like to point out inconsistencies and I do try to sound smart but thats because I see a better option. However I try to make that a suggestion and ask them questions instead its a learning process. People also think I give off an air of intimidation but all I want to do is uhm talk to you and have a conversation with you... gtgt  Theres a few events in my life that significantly changed who I am. My mother passed away which brings me grief and cynicism. Joining an online comuunity that I learned a lot from and having a lot of deep meaningful conversation with them changed fundelmentally how I view the world until today. My relationship with an INTJ exbf in general made me realise my potential and how to nurture it. However the breakup brought me into an episode of Major Depression.

11540042,0,t1_dg41oyh,Im sorry to hear youve been experiencing great stress of lateif you are an ENTJ one thing I can truthfully say about them is that they typically tend to rebound from stressoverload very quickly provided they get enough sleep which they often do not.,mbti,dg42dkw,2,t5_2s90r

11546019,0,t1_dg4pe6a,Yeah I do see great points for Ne but the Te seems a bit valued hating useless conversations and main aim pertaining to academic achievement. OP do you constantly seek novelty for its own sake? Always thinking about new stuff to do and doing poorly on the follow through? Ne dominants tend to be great procrastinators when it comes to repetitive tasks or studying things theyve already figured out even for important examinations. This is FAR less in the ENFPs due to tertiary Te but this is pure disaster in the ENTPs. People hate their th functionmobilising function in socionics. So do you hate Se more living in the moment seizing the day or Fe keeping appearances maintaining social harmony and kind of being fake and polite just so that people can get along? ?Also which thing could you care less about analysis for the sake of analysis without getting any tangible result Ti or filling information with your own subjective impressions seeing how things progress over time and seeking possibilities without necessarily yielding any result in reality Ni sorry theres no actual way to explain it in short instead of thinking about the various facets of a single concept or seeking novelty and hence interacting with the objectNe rather than pursuing subjectivity like Ni?,mbti,dg4qrxx,2,t5_2s90r
11548762,0,t3_64lzdz,I recommend looking at ISFJ followed by ISTJ. The way you perceive your experience with both NiNe sounds like tertinf Ne. Can you elaborate on your Ne Ti and Te. Not behaviourisms you think come from those functions. I want actual situations where you thoughtthink in retrospect you were using x y z functions.,mbti,dg51zlr,3,t5_2s90r
11549597,0,t1_dg4tqwg,gtI reckon it may be that Im overwhelmed by all the possibilities presented by a situation...gtWhich seems pretty darn INFPish now that I think about itbeing overwhelmed by the possibilities.FWIW or not I would associate this with Ne low in the stack. The INFP Neaux would have a far more positive relationship with possibilities  thats certainly what Ive seen in the INFP I know and I think its pretty noncontroversial that INFP Neaux would be more positive about possibilities.So something really doesnt add up here. Have you considered ISFJ?,mbti,dg55ei2,5,t5_2s90r

11593793,0,t1_dga5rq2,Its stereotyping in general. One that I see too often is that some people seem to believe that thinking and feeling are almost mutually exclusive. They then apply that to other people or even worse themselves.,mbti,dga5xxg,3,t5_2s90r

11627414,0,t3_65q0qc,No never. I was unsure of ISFP vs INFP for a long time but always leaned toward ISFP. I was put off by the super creative artsy stereotype of ISFPs and identified with the idealist stereotype of INFPs but never quite felt like an INFP.Once I learned more about the functions and how ISFPs and INFPs are motivated differently and interact with the world differently I became extremely sure of my type.Also hanging out in ISFP and INFP forums I definitely have more in common with ISFPs.,mbti,dgdza4c,1,t5_2s90r

11659215,0,t3_66ce5l,One that I usually do which works like  of the time for my friends made up statistic is to ask what red means. Typically Ns quickly respond something like love anger compassion or fire. The Ss usually are taken back by the question and either dont answer or take longer to answer.

11670914,0,t3_66ja8z,I cant remember I used to have a list that Id have anyone that became more than an acquaintance over college would take. Id estimate at least  people. Though I never found a test I was quite satisfied with so I invalidated a lot of the early results that seemed to have an unusual Jbias. Sadly I lost the list and just couldnt be bothered to retest everyone I figure its more accurate for me to get to know them and type them myself. ,mbti,dgiwwue,2,t5_2s90r

11740549,0,t3_67hggo,I continually get ENTP whenever I take the test I took an official test for a college class and have taken dozens online as well. Yet Im always amazed I get Extroverted type. I keep getting ENTP because my strongest function by a significant margin is Ne. Plus the xNTP best fits my personality. Anyways...I really dont like hanging out on big groups or at parties concerts etc. If I never had to hang out in a group of  or more for the rest of my life Id be so incredibly happy. That being said I have a small number of people who I love to be with nearly always one at a time and I get really charged from having great one on one conversations with strangers. Although I dont mind alone time I almost always would prefer to be talking with one of my close friends. Im not socially awkward and I have no trouble reading peoples feelings or social cues. Its just exhausting to be around lots of people and it feels like it lacks authenticity. Plus the conversations in groups never have much depth which is usually boring. Also unlike the stereotypical ENTP I dont live to argue. I dont like arguing in groups or with strangers but I am very blunt and quick to call someone Im comfortable out if theyre being illogical. So I dont know what label that would be. I see how it leans towards the extroverted side because I can talk forever with those close to me or even with some I just met but I detest being the center of attention being loud in public or being socially daring with a stranger. ,mbti,dgqtkj7,3,t5_2s90r
