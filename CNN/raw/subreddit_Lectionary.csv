With great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all.  There was not a needy person among them for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold.  They laid it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to each as any had need.
