8220629,0,t1_d54zu1x,I do discord lol.. Teamspeak on the other hand has better voice quality in my opinion.  We could setup a Discord if necessary.. I think that with Discord after you have many different rooms it starts to become cluttered.  Teamspeak if we have multiple games we support is easier to navigate and to set up channel admins etc. ,clans,d554v5h,1,t5_2s9hg
