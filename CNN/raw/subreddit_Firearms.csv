137372,0,t3_1vnku5,I havent purchased any guns directly through Cabelas but I have personally transferred two rifles through them and witnessed a close friend purchase guns directly from them. If you are buying direct from them then there shouldnt be a transfer fee. If they have to ship a gun from one of their other stores to your store then they shouldnt charge you a transfer fee but I believe they do charge you for the shipping.  If you are having something transferred in through them outside of their inventory then expect a steep fee. I live in Indiana and they charge me  dollars a transfer. Its ridiculously high in my area but until recently it was the only dealer I trusted to not fuck up the paperwork or I was willing to give money some of my LGS are shady shitheads. Most shops in my area charge between  bucks. Other then that they are a decent gun shop. Mine has a MASSIVE gun section with a huge variety of in stock stuff. The problem is they can be a bit expensive since they are a big box store. Expect slightly more than MSRP and low ball trade in quotes. Their staff are nice and professional but arent usually that knowledgeable compared to LGS staff. Cabelas people have more of a baseline knowlege of their wares and dont expect them to understand gun legalities outside of what they need to know for proper s. The gun department managers are usually more knowledgeable than the counter staff though.As far as buying direct its pretty painless with the exception that they DO NOT haggle. The price on the tag is what they want.

240776,0,t3_1wv5g5,Lets discuss the word devastating when it comes to ammo. Specifically ammo that is going to be used against fleshy living things. It has nothing to do with dumping energy early or blowing up melonssodawateretc. The entire point of ammo used on living breathing fleshy things is that it causes damage deep enough to tear up the vitals. This ammo is essentially turning any handgun into a Taurus Judge loaded with minibuckshot and slug ammo. You get the worst of all scenarios. A birdshotlike shallow wound that wont cause significant bleeding or disabling effect and the over penetrationminimal wound track of an fmj. You want to create large wounds in the big blood filled innards of your target not tear up muscle not shred skin. You want to do that after making it through clothing skin and bone. The tests this guy did are more or less worthless to combat the problems people have with this ammo. It is easy to make ammo that looks great in ballistics gelwatermelonssodaetc. Those mediums are consistent and since water is nearly incompressible it tends to really open rounds up. The ballistics gel tests he did were pretty worthless because he didnt have any clothing in the way. We already knew they opened up in bare gelatin how about with  layers of denim. Do they get clogged? Drywall test is kind of interesting but since we dont know how many walls his control roundmore on that in a minute would stop in much less how many walls a RIP round would go through we didnt learn much. Chicken is really not a good analog for humans you can stick your thumb through a chicken. Seriously try it sometime. Chickens are soft and their bones are weak. The chicken as well as the pork shoulder are also the perfect depth for the devastating exit wound to be within the depth of the RIPs petal penetration. Stack two of those pork shoulders together and not only would the RIPs exit wound being a tiny little hole but the traditional hollow point probably would have been able to open up more. Remember we want big wounds deep thats where the goodies are. Again lets do that with  layers of denim on the outside layer. Lets go ahead and hit that big bone inside the shoulder lets see how well the RIP makes it through. It isnt uncommon for rounds to hit a forearm or rib in the way in a defensive shooting. Also why in the world would they test this against an SampB hollow point? Does anyone actually carry that stuff? I dont think Ive ever even seen it. Why not use a common round that is well understood and considered a good round preferably one used by a major policemilitary unit? Fuck it Im going to send a box of this stuff to TNOutdoors as soon as I can. He seems to be the only sane ammo test channel out there. Note Just want to make it clear Im not mad at OP. Just not sure why this ammo is getting the attention it is without any actual data on it. It isnt a major deviation from other gimmick rounds that have been terrible in real world use in the past it just has better marketing. So until we can get some actual solid data this round shouldnt be getting the hype. ,Firearms,cf5pi7e,50,t5_2ryez

257259,0,t1_cf7dmoq,I know. I get what youre saying. But I dont think you understood what I mean. Im saying that the  trocars plus the center piece make  pieces. Not  total rounds. I also think that  of the trocars are quite possibly more effective than birdshot especially after watching the  videos I saw which show the penetration and trajectories in the ballistic gel. The outward trajectories of the trocars once the bullet hits the human target seems very useful since highly accurate shot placement to vital organs isnt as important. The probability of the trocars hitting vital organs is much higher than from a single typical HP round although admittedly the caliberdiameter not cylindrical of each on its own is much smaller.The RIP is also barrier penetrating which is a positive aspect for doing things like penetrating denim.  If its rated to penetrate FBI barriers I dont see how it would do a poor job in a typical scenario of having to shoot someone intent on doing the shooter serious physical harm.  ,Firearms,cf7f606,1,t5_2ryez

417675,0,t1_cfny8gh,If it was an actual James Bond gun then it would have been the Walther PPK chambered in . or . ACP.  The PPK is a blowback operated pistol which means that the gun uses only the weight of the slide and the strength of the recoil spring to keep the chamber closed during firing.  This mechanism is extremely simple and can be very compact hence why its used in pistols like the PPK but it recoils very hard and very sharply.  Additionally the PPK is a relatively small and light gun which means theres less weight in the gun to absorb the recoil and more of it goes into your hand and to add insult to injury because its thin it increases the pressure applied to your hand which makes it dig in more.  The PPK can be a nice carry pistol if youre strapped for space but it is not a fun gun to shoot.Personally I start new shooters off with .LR in rifle and pistol.  But after that I transition them to a nice big steel pistol in mm or . ACP something like a SIG P or a .  The Browning short recoil operation and the greater mass makes them shoot a lot softer than smaller guns.  Though admittedly the SIG is a bit of a reach for some people to get their fingers around.,Firearms,cfo23em,2,t5_2ryez

We need better healthcare all around with better accessibility and the destigmatization of mental healthcare. But thats not going to stop someone from killing people. You take away all the guns we will just other forms of mass killings whether its bombs poisons or even knifings. The best thing to do is live in the yellow. We need to be vigilante always.

I maintain that the media has this extremely blown global warming out of proportion because doom sells. I also maintain that I can get you published studies out of China that state staring a purple dots for  hours a day will make you penis larger.There are monitary and political interests behind the global warming scare climate change happens with or with out humans the rate of change you speak of has happed before. In the record it has actually gone much faster on numerous occasions.  The line on the graph is not smooth it crazy jagged technical term. There is history of turn arounds like I described earlier as well.Ill bet you believe all the recycling you sort and put out gets made into new stuff and that it reduces energy usage and emissions.

What good is a right you cant exercise? gt They are not pawns. They are free thinking human beings who made the choice to carry rifles that scare the crap out of many people into a public place in order to according to them promote the cause of firearms ownership and fight for the right to carry a firearm.Pawn infers an outside controlling party. You cant ever be pawns in your own scheme that would make you the chessmaster in that analogy. They are pawns in the MDA PR campaign. I also take exception with the fact that they OC to scare people. OCing is not brandishing not without the intent to cause duress. If someone goes into panic simply by seeing a firearm it is their responsibility to reduce that exposure.

1202670,0,t1_ci4wh11,There are rights that can when executed in certain ways result in violence or harm. Speech can be used to incite violence or cause harm. Religion can be used to incite violence or cause harm. Another area in which countervailing rights must be balanced is voting. You have a right to vote. But there are restrictions placed on how you vote in order to preserve the integrity of elections. And there is great debate as to how that is balanced. We have the right to bear arms. The public has a right to safety. By the very nature of humans bad things happen. When bad things happen with firearms either by accident neglect or intent people can get hurt or killed. Even in places where people have great training and reason to possess for example the FBI training center at Quantico people get hurt some years back there were several injured by negligent discharge of firearms in the possession by FBI firearms instructors.

1225148,0,t3_284weg,Whats going on in your moms mind is a fascinating and exciting process.  I know because I went through a similar process myself.For you a gun is just a thing a possession like any other expensivesomewhat dangerous tool we own.  But to your mom a gun is was a highly extraordinary thing an extremely dangerous object akin to a smallscale nuclear warhead something BAD.  Her belief system tells her she should have nothing to do with it and more than that she should not WANT anything to do with it because its dangerous.  In this way its not unlike a highly devout homeschooled Catholic who encounters porn for the first time a lifetime of belief tells them the porn is bad and they should reject it without consideration just as your mom rejected guns.But then she is forced to live with heathens for a while and realizes its not that bad.  Slowly she takes baby steps allowing you to let her hold the guns and explain which is which.  She cant appear too enthusiastic because to do so just feels like something she isnt allowed to do.  But she is curious so she goes along with it and doesnt fight back as much as she might have all the while remembering carefully what she begrudgingly lets you explain.I would bet that after you went to bed she probably sat and stared at the guns with curiosity for a bit not wanting to touch them but still interested to see one up close.  And Ill be when she asked you to put them away and correctly IDd them there was a little hidden internal smile at getting the IDs right.  She is on the path.So take her to the range.  Take it slow.  Start her off with a ..  Make sure she has a good experience.  And dont expect a  overnight on her attitude.  She will take time to process everything its a gradual process.  But keep inviting her to the range chances are she will go for it.  Mixed in there do handling lessons at home.  Get rid of all the ammo and let her play with racking the slide loadingunloading etc to get a feel for the guns.  Teach her the Four Rules and how to make a gun safe.  This is a great confidence builder.In time guns will be as normal for her as they are now to you and me. I was never antigun but I grew up in a household without guns.  It wasnt until later when a friend introduced me that I got into guns.  And while I didnt have an antigun belief there was a certain extraordinary property to guns like they were something I wasnt supposed to be doing.  When I went to the range I didnt tell anybody lest anyone get the wrong idea.  I worried about being seen walking into the gun store even though it was right next to the range.  Its difficult to explain why it just felt like something I wasnt supposed to do even though I was highly interested.  But with some time and training and practice owning guns and going to a range are as normal for me now as typing this longass post.  I think your mom is going through the same process.,Firearms,ci7g46f,38,t5_2ryez

How about that? I dont see how Asking a community what they think excels so well that it is thier favorite is whoring. It would say for example allow those who specialize or really enjoy shotguns and dont really shoot rifles or pistols to see what the good Rifles and Pistols are. Lets say youve never seen a pistol before in your life and youve only ever shot Shotguns. You want a pistol since carring a shotgun is more difficult then a Pistol so you see a post What is your favorite firarm and why? And those who state thier favorite pistols are possible leads as to what you may carry for personal protection as those guns have exceled so well at being good guns that they are favorites. And i have spammed rFirearms with my Insipid posts but you have to avail oneselfs of name calling to try to get any point along? That is Imbicilic at best. and yes i may have been banned from rGuns but then again I havent made use of another account to go on rGuns so it shows that rGuns and i have no consanguinity with them and have cut it rather then made another account and have made conniption with them again.

1736003,0,t3_2ean46,Im pretty new to the ownership of firearms and I cant see why the restrictions and accountability that these bills promote are wholly negative and inspire such resistance from the more forwardthinking members of the shooting community.Let me preface the following by saying that up until recently I was a lifelong California resident who while never having an aversion to firearms did not grow up around anyone who owned or operated them. Now Im a CCW permit holder in a state much less restrictive towards firearms because I like guns. I like their mechanicalness their understandability the challenge of shooting them and the supportive shooting community composed of passionate knowledgeable people. The weird thing is I have an easier time understanding the progun regulation stance than the antiregulation rhetoric.Southern California sees a lot of gang and drug related gun violencea lot more than most other parts of the nation especially rural areas with highest reverence for gun rights. This is the part of the state that de Leon is from and spent his political career representing. He wants to make obtaining ammunition and moving illegal firearms more difficult and riskier for violent criminals and I cant really blame him. I also cant blame the people who have not had much exposure to an environment like this to resist outright the legislature encroaching on rights previously held. Frankly its not remotely fair that a geographically small but population dense city make the rules for the rest of the state a la California Illinois.These bills though to me just seem like ways to increase accountability of firearms holders and hold them to what certainly is a great responsibility in firearms ownership. Guns and ammo are already expensive as Ive come to find.  dollars for an ammo permit really isnt any money compared to the cost of the ammunition itself and its certainly worth the peace of mind that it affords to the people who have no interest in firearms knowing that every purchase of ammo and every legally owned gun can be identified and traced back to some accountable party and that the accountable party is of a healthy frame of mind as to not pose a threat of danger of those around him. This notion of safetyasperceivedbyothers is already present and understood by the shooting community to be a net positive. At the range why do we keep our guns pointed downrange and the actions open when not in use when as the operator of those firearms we know theyre completely unloaded and in a safe state? Because others dont and their safety and comfort is equally paramount to our own. I know there are other issues on the senate floor besides the ammo permit but since they seem to follow similar principles I wont address them in this post.California has a bunch of gun control laws that I dont agree with passed by people with little understanding of firearms approved handgun roster anyone? but these bills on the table dont seem like they would prevent anyone who has any reasonable business owning a firearm from obtaining one or keeping the ones they currently own. Am I missing something here? Its really disappointing to see ignorant progun regulation voices met by narrowminded antigun regulation belligerence. It doesnt really happen here but it happens on the more popular forums like YouTube and it causes the progun control bastions which write and pass these laws to disregard the opinions of the shooting community at large.One day Id like to go back to California. Its a beautiful state full of really intelligent people who just happen to not have a twosided understanding of gun issues.

They just recently put in better stops and did the whole NRA overhead stops so you cant shoot higher than the backstop  this was all done within the last  years.My dad has had the property for  years  and sometime either early within his ownership or before he owned it and we just didnt notice  something put a bullet hole through the side of the side of a cold storage steel building.  I cant say with  certainty the bullet came from there  but the range is within only a slight angle  maybe  degrees from the shooting benches  so they would have not only needed to have been shooting towards the sky but also away from the backstop.Regardless Its a bullet hole.  It could have come from this range.  It could have come from a gas station thats between there and the range.

Anybody remember this?  I feel its a good way to really dive into the meat of the argument and truely give the creators a fair chance to persuade me in whatever direction.So I head on over to the website from the video  which happens to be a gunshop. Cool! I like those.  With  guns listed on the homepagestore page the first thing that strikes my face is the seemingly random and at times quite lacking and uninformative descriptions found on the main store page.  I feel the descriptions were just seen as a place to put in buzzwords. mm caliber? I dont think Ive ever seen or heard it said that way before To prove this further  what is the point in listing  rounds  What does that mean?   rounds what?  round come with the gun when purchased?  It was tested with a  round dump?  What? High temperature HandguardBuzzwords to first time buyer and its other stuff like that too  why are they marketing a compact gun  with a  round magazine? very compact.  To be honest the page is setup in a way that looks like you would pick a category then browse firearms in that category.   But when a category is opened it just brings you straight to a page with the generic name and a picture of a firearm that fits in the generic name... kinda like how a categories work. Then you find a small testimonial over the selected guncategorys effectiveness and then thats it.  There is no buy button anywhere! .But I most feel the cream of the crop is their First Time Buyers tab. Where you are directed to a quiz which will decide if it is safe for you to own a gun. But thats not even the best part!  After going through it multiple times with all sorts of different answer combinations  It always reaches the conclusion that it is safer to not have a gun in the house and be responsibly prepared. .yeah... and im not even going to descuss how fake the video is as thats already been done pretty much.All in all I really hope no true first time buyers get turned off and thrown into this guilt feels trip.

Thats how much of war imminent threats of law enforcement selfdefense work and people need to stop pretending it isnt that way. Its too much political correctness. Politicians are forced to say things like our troops defend our country and our rights. rather than our troops need to kill the enemy in order to send a message to anyone else that might threaten us. Why does everything have to be so pleasantly worded? This has had effects on society that are completely bizarre where even someone like Ron Paul can say that killing OBL was wrong. That when ISIS put out names of soldiers the police told the families of those soldiers that they are investigating and provided nothing to defend them and did not suggest to them to arm themselves. That even the suggestion that teachers should be armed in schools to protect our children is gasped at and ridiculed in the media.  But no one bats an eye when banks hire armed guards for their money.The pervasive societal deontological brainwashing is that violence is not the answer even though it is the answer in many many cases.Think about it. You felt the need the urge to warn someone about a title because it might present the idea in a headline that a bad guy must be killed so that an innocent person can be saved. That this idea would give gunowners a bad image. Like as if this headline would suddenly give ammunition to journalists to say gun owners enjoy killing people. This is how widespread the propaganda has gone. That we are afraid of even mentioning that killing is justified. If it was up to the media killing is never justified no matter what.

Had his brother not turned him in he may never have been caught and he certainly got lots of attention he might not otherwise had if hed been the pussy most other folks are.

That suggestion would probably not make him very happy.It wouldnt make him happy because it is horribly flawed. I see where you are coming from both can be thought of as tools and their goodness or badness is a function of how we use them. The big distinction between the two is that guns dont really beget more guns. As much as gun collecting might become an addiction for a few by and large there is a diminishing marginal utility to guns. Each additional purchase confers less and less value. It has a negative or damped feedback loop. Technology on the other hand is self reinforcing and self propagating. It has become in many respects its own organism with a positive feedback loop.

3775861,0,t1_cqmf8xm,Summary from and attendeeAnother attendee here. Ill try to summarize but I have zero experience in a courtroom so my interpretation of events is pretty sketchy. When I got there Nolo and the others asked who I was. I didnt know who was who so I wasnt quite sure how to respond Im from the internet doesnt really sound appropriate. Told them I was from the website which seemed to work  Everybody was dressed very professionally and made it through streetlevel and courtlevel security successfully. It turned out to be fairly sparsely attended. Nolo had two others with him for legal support and the feds had two guys. Nolo did all the talking for us a short youngish guy spoke for DOJ. I think it was scheduled for about an hour but it ran for  from  to . DISCLAIMER... My notes are just general bullet points I jotted down. Im no stenographer so its far from complete or comprehensive. Just trying to draw a bit of a picture for the gang here. Judge Lynn started out by having DOJ review issues related to standing. DOJ Injury discussion Commerce clause Even if federal law allowed MGs TX law does not so this case is irrelevant The Dakota silencer letter trust is not a person Referenced the relevance of a cockfighting case! NFA safe harbor Nolo During introduction Judge asked Nolo to pronounce his name  times Fed definition of MG differs from TX definition more than one shot per trigger pull vs more than two. Therefore a fed decision is not directly transferrable to state ? Maddox letter Dakota letter Explained the specific situation of ATF approving the Hollis Form  and other Forms s as well but ATF has no authorized process or authority for disapproval so this is a due process issue In response to a question tried to explain the ATFs Form  approval process to the Judge which isnt really publicly documented but requires supervisory approval in addition to examiner approval. A mistake doesnt just happen by one persons accidental mark on the form approval it was vetted and approved. Judge acknowledged that she is not all that familiar with NFAA issues DOJ Surprised at difference between fed and TX definition of MG Claimed that a trust is still a person regardless of any letter stating otherwise Played down the importance of ATF reversing their decision after an erroneous approval Then it got into more general A issue discussions. DOJ References Heller and the Supreme Court decision and nothing in the Heller decision prevents banning of MGs Claims ATF doesnt have authority to approve Form  MGs due to existing law MGs are dangerous and unusual and therefore not protected by A MGs not commonly used for protection MGs commonly adapted for criminal use MGs outside the scope of A And other standardized .gov arguments against MGs Discussed relevance of scrutiny levels i.e. intermediate strict scrutiny Nolo Explained that based on prior Form  approvals that ATF does in fact have authority to approve MGs e.g. Stemple Ms that were approved post. Judge looked at copy of approved Form  for one of the Stemple Ms and asked about the date which had been redacted. Nolo offered to provide details of this case at a later date to help provide relevance. Disputed DOJ assertion than MGs are commonly used for criminal use extremely small percentage compared to handguns Requested the court to define dangerous and unusual since term is thrown around loosely but other courts have not defined it Addressed various DOJ antiMG rhetoric DOJ Tried to reenforce their earlier claims that relevant details of Miller and Heller ruling do intersect And that was it. No decision from the Judge she just disappeared through the little door behind her bench. Another case that was scheduled to start at  had quite a few other people coming into the courtroom starting about  so Judge Lynn was kind enough to let our case continue for a bit longer with all the attorneys trying to be brief at the end. ,Firearms,cqmociz,4,t5_2ryez

There ought to be an exception to possession charges for guns drugs etc if youre only possessing with the intent to safely dispose of the item. That could be hard to prove but surely showing up at a pawn shop and actually selling it would qualify. The clear lack of malice or criminal intent is selfevident.Moreover without such an exception there is no way to legally extricate yourself from a position where you unintentionally or unwillingly come into contact with a prohibited item. That by itself is pretty bullshit. That type of law is why the saying shoot shovel and shut up exists. It encourages people to do bad things because the alternative is getting in trouble for doing good things.However there is one facet this story gets wrong... he hasnt been a perfect angel since his convictions  years ago.The story indicates he has toed the line for  years original convictions   of them all pretty heavy felonies  were in  released in  but a commenter dug up that he was actually arrested for nd degree criminal trespass in  didnt list if he was convicted or not and convicted in  of aggravated assault  endangerment. I dont know if thats a complete list down to traffic tickets.In light of this I have to wonder if his heart was really in the right place hey I probably shouldnt have this or if he was just looking to make a few bucks.

Thats not really socialism but it got called that enough that it became the common meaning for the term mainly through describing Soviet Russia and its holdings.Big S Socialism turned out to be an unequivocally bad thing. But little s socialism can take many forms besides the government doles out ownershiponpaper of supposedly communist countries and the form youre suggesting sounds like a productivity innovation and equality promoting economic system.If youre a Socialist you probably didnt study history but theres nothing inherently wrong with socialism even if some people take it too far andor have historically made a horrible mess out of it.,Firearms,crg3mac,3,t5_2ryez

Clearly they cant claim to have the moral high ground by saying gun control saves livesgun control reduces the overall crime rate if theyre okay with letting the civilian population of another country buy all these guns theyve exported.So do they do it because they are greedy and selfish from the perspective of their own countries antigun stances because they only apply their delusions of safety to their own country or are they immoral liars who want an easier population to control when they need to while making some extra money on the side?,Firearms,crw6d96,-1,t5_2ryez

As a young white male in my early s my costs went up doubled when Obamacare kicked in same as with my employer  they just didnt pass the entire increase on to me just the same percentage. So I can blame Obamacare for not getting the raise I should have. This is the same story with many of the younger crowd in the country whose insurance rose rapidly to pay for all the people who go to the doctor too much and want us to subsidize them.

Im sure people reading this will be offended but the truth is many leftists have a hard on talking about tolerance with one hand and demand censorship of people they disagree with with the other. They dont see the NRA as millions of voters who pay money to make sure their interests are represented. They see the NRA as a marketing firm for gun manufacturers and are trying to dehumanize it as such. If you get people to ignore the millions of members the NRA has its easier to push the notion that the NRA is just another cold corporate industry.

5876717,0,t3_3vqpzd,Gun control is an attempt to simplify a much larger problem. Systems thinking teaches that there exist whether we like it or not problems that are much larger than we as a single person are capable of understanding and processing. This happens because the problem is part of so many other sub systems and affects and is affected by so many things that there is no viewable change by altering one single piece. Gun control is an attempt to create a singular solution to solve one side affect of a much larger issue. I believe this issue is a social one and focuses primarily on our lack of understanding in combating the desire of certain people to want to harm others. Many people view the limiting or removal of guns as a way to prevent those who want to harm others from attaining weapons that are capable of killing many people. What is often over looked by people is that someone determined to harm other people in mass quantities doesnt rely on the use of firearms as a means to accomplish this goal of terrorism. the Oklahoma City bombings were carried out with a package truck and several tons of fertilizer.  was a carefully planned attack using box cutters and airplanes to kill massive amounts of people. The IRA used car bombs as a man form of weaponry in its campaign against the British. These attaches are just a few examples in which firearms werent a primary weapon in achieve acts of terrorism. Additionally just because we limit or remove firearms legally doesnt remove there existence from the country. Drugs are illegal but that doesnt prevent people from attaining them. I personally do not believe the US has the policing capabilities to enforce such laws. Further more those people determined to attain firearms would still do so regardless of the legality. While I can appreciate his point of view on the subject. I believe the political climate and social system of Australia is vastly different from her in the states and the outcome of gun control wouldnt necessarily be the same as they experienced.  We are a much larger country that contains many different cultures in comparison. Also Australia being an island creates a significantly more robust way to prevent the flow of illegal arms in and out of the country in comparison to the geographic composition of the United States. Additionally the US is seen as a primary leader in the world and receives way more attention both good and bad world wide than Australia does. ,Firearms,cxpywu2,6,t5_2ryez

Christians have done more damage to this country than anti gun people. I still have my guns but people still take rights away from people in the name of Christianity.  Jesus in all the writings about him if you choose to follow that was the biggest socialist going.  He taught to take care of the poor and the sick. The conservatives are the first to cast them aside. God and Jesus looked at all people equally everyone is the same in the eyes of the lord original sin and all that. Sounds pretty socialist to me.Conservatives believe in a survival of the fittest economic model which favors those with money.  The marrying of Christian and conservative ideals is just a dishonest and convenient way to control the white lower and middle class.  The fact that they push gun rights is not enough for me to forgive them for the fact that the poorest in our country lack basic healthcare that people rot in prisons because of draconian drug laws and our world is being destroyed in the continued pursuit of money.

Id say the same about any politician who dares to have a chat with some AQ leader or some westboro baptist church member.. he pushes exactly. Trump is well known as the leader of the birther conspiracies about Obama. That was quite embarrassing and probably what prevented him from running in  after he recently switched parties.. You mean he loves his home country theres a difference between loving your country and being a nativist and xenophobe. This probably explains why he thinks Obama faked his birth certificate. Because to him Obama is a foreigner.. negotiation and salesmanship?  Isnt that like  of what politics is? Yes but we arent electing politicians and marketers were electing leaders and statesmen and that is the opposite of what a politician should be doing. Negotiations is a good statesmen quality but its not something that Trump has a monopoly on. Obama amp Kerry are an anomaly in statesmanship in their bad negotiation skills. gt because you somehow think that accepting the official narrative on its face is what sane and rational people do.No I accept narratives based on evidence. You reject official narratives as a conspiracy theorist based on emotion. If the narrative of Alex Jones made sense and had evidence to back it up Id accept his as well but it isnt. Its just dumbassery.I cant believe I have to explain to you why thinking Alex Jones is stupid does not mean you believe every official narrative.gtsubversive and dishonest nationwide movement that has its tentacles in media and political circlesWhich says nothing truthful about conspiracy theorists even if you are right about this conspiracy.gtextremely sympathetic to a hybrid politicalreligious ideology that in its purest form is  incompatible with western valuesObamas sympathies for secularism or the fact that he thinks Muslims should be given benefits of the doubt doesnt make Obama correct but it also doesnt make Trump correct. Many MuslimAmericans fought for US troops against terrorists and Trump brings shame upon Americans with his ideas of banning all Muslims including US citizens and asking them their religion before they enter the US like as if jihadists dont lie? STUPIDITY AT ITS FINEST.Can you at least admit that Trump is stupid on that subject? I know its hard to betray your love but this guy is not jesus. Hes not some savior of America. Admit that at least hes stupid on a variety of subjects even if you agree with him on some.gtAnd youre saying that its impossible that such subversion and deceit can ever occur in any other sphere of politics or power structures.I did not say that.

The very thought of violence even if justified is something thats become unthinkable to so many people.I mean dont get me wrong the idea of living in a Star Trek utopia where violence is abhorrent and most people dont have to deal with it is very attractive I get it... and certainly theres going to be a period of transition between where we are now and that ideal where people will actually be in the process of evolving and well have some weird situations and I kind of think thats maybe where we are right now.But the bottom line is that even in the Star Trek utopia the Borg still come around wanting to fuck shit up and the only way to deal with it is through violence... sure you only beat them by outthinking them but you start by firing phasers anyway.  People NOW need to realize that as much as we all abhor senseless violence you dont defeat it by throwing your hands up and essentially saying I want a world without violence so therefore I wont meet violence with violence.  Thats fucking retarded and yet thats precisely what so many people these days essentially are saying and whats sadder still is they dont even realize thats what theyre saying but its the natural consequence of their attitudes.We should all want to avoid violence and we should all work to avoid situations where violence is necessary and we should all work towards making violence a thing of the past so we can reach that Star Trek utopia we all want but if you arent willing to be violent in defense of your life NOW when violence is directed towards you then your ideals about the way you want the world to be or even the way you mistakenly think it is already will cost you the chance to ever see that world or anything else for that matter.  People need to stop being such fucking pussies about everything stop thinking you can make the world a safe place overnight.  Maybe we can get there some day but its going to be a slow deliberate process and you dont get there by just shutting off the violence valve overnight.,Firearms,d0igann,13,t5_2ryez

First I trained at tactical response the first time over three years ago and have taken several classes since. In the time since I have stayed many nights in James home and had dinner breakfast with him and his family. Im not special. He does this with all of his students. Once a year he has an alumni weekend where he offers two days of free training to everyone who has trained there before. While there Ive heard a lot of stories that James would never tell himself of how he has helped people. Helped people is ways that most people wouldnt do and most people wouldnt think less of you for not doing. As far as training goes the classes are first and foremost a mindset class. The classes are almost like a martial art class. Anyone can learn how to punchshoot but being able to do that while getting punchedshot at takes a lot of mindset training.

From the image it appears that as the bolt closes the string will pull the trigger and it will not stop until the magazine is empty or otherwise impeded. The trigger in this case would be the person allowing the bolt to close the first time. Similarly gatling guns are not considered machine guns because a person must continuously crank the gun for it to fire if you stop cranking it stops firing. However if you were to replace the hand crank with an electric motor you have just created a machine gun because you can press a button and fire more than one bullet per trigger pull. ,Firearms,d10b48r,11,t5_2ryez

Two place two strips of tape forward of the trigger guard on the lower half. Three Mark  and  all the way to the end. Also mark  forward of the trigger guard.

It also doesnt necessarily need to be run by the government private companies have access to these databases as well. The company can essentially just submit inquiries to LEO databases for stolen property information on the sellers firearm and the other just a typical run of the mill NICS  form for the purchaser.Interesting hypothetical question though for anyone still paying attentionSay the person selling the gun is the original owner legally but was charged and served for a felony and then sold their originally legally obtained firearm that was never foundconfiscated by LEOs to a legal purchaser. Is there a criminal in that besides felon in possession of a firearm?

It was really confusing since the medics showed up after I ran at some point and honestly who knows what to expect after you get assaulted no one expects to ever be in that situation...but I was and it was very obvious immediately that it was this one staff dude trying to cover his ass is some girl tells on you for nearly killing her during an academic counseling session put her in a mental hospital thus immediately discrediting everything she says. Before I knew for sure why I was there I told the nurse this and they obviously thought I was crazy....until they got a call from the staff dude saying I needed to be in there indefinitely and just blasting profanities at them. They were like um no shes fine scared obviously but fine....youre the one who sounds like you need to be in here and they basically wrote the more formal version of that on my release paperwork. So yeah even though it was VERY fraudulent I have no idea if records like that from another state would cross over and disqualify me and have me waiting and on a watchlist for years or send the police to my door. Neither thing is good.  its a pickle I guess. ,Firearms,d48hvyb,1,t5_2ryez

However the BATF would limit that exception to transactions in which the parent herself or himself is the purchaserthe Transferee Buyer.According to the testimony of BATF Special Agent Sterling Nixon when a parent purchases a gun for her child even with the childs own money she is required to list her own name as the transferee buyer.  BATF Form  simply is not designed to accommodate a straw purchase whether or not it is lawful.As noted in the panel opinion not all straw transactions are illegal. Moore I  F.d at .  The paradigmatic straw transaction is of course the legal standin of a parent for her or his minor child.As you can see even the BATF agrees that parents can purchase for their children as the Transferee without violating the GCA.

Gun control makes it easier for criminals to get guns and more difficult for law abiding citizens to get guns. It absolutely favors the criminal and makes the law abiding less safe.

Regulations on trucks already exist. You have to have a special driver license to drive trucks with difficult exams and in some country  psi evaluation. . You cant drive them in certain roads. You cannot drive them on weekends in Europe   because they cause congestion and increase the number of accidents . You can not drive over a certain speed limit.  You can buy a truck but not a tank or an oversize truck. . If you need to drive an oversize truck you have to ask permission and provide the route. You have to renew your license every so often ... Consider that most gun grabbers will settle for having gun owners take an exam and a license  before buying a gun. Of course crazies will find a way to kill massive amounts of people no matter how much you regulate. The question is how easy you want to make it on them.  ,Firearms,d5dxbc4,2,t5_2ryez

As they try to hide and control the information getting out it would lead to more distrust elsewhere. An armed end to a conflict could easily lead to more elsewhere and greater support for those against the government. Really Id expect a lot more of an unorganized guerrilla campaign. People fighting back in small areas.For what its worth the video posted elsewhere in this talks about the police and national guard during katrina. Because of their actions trying to disarm people Id expect issues if they tried again.  I know people who if they saw the police going door to door like that during a natural disaster would retreat and engage later. I could see a standoff causing people to do the same thing elsewhere.

Some regulation is needed to ensure the smooth operation of the free market and a social safety net is a small price to pay to catch those who fall through the cracks.Ill always prefer the minimal amount of regulation necessary to ensure the public good and Ill always favor the free market as the default so long as it actually works.   Unfortunately our healthcare system simply isnt working and the only people who seem to be at all interested in fixing it and have a remotely workable plan are those who would socialize health insurance.  If someone has a realistic freemarket alternative Im all ears but frankly no one is offering any useful ideas.Especially since Obamacare was basically the conservative Heritage Foundation hybrid freemarket alternative from the nineties but Republicans have been doing everything in their power to make sure their own idea fails because it was implemented by a Democratic President.

We dont want to allow people a legal avenue to poach wildlife within a National Park.

Look at Syria and Turkey.  The government forces are or already have steamrolled over their opposition and in the case of Syria are only stymied because of outside interests.  To parrot the article  I worry youre wrong but hope youre right.gtYeah you might have bagged that guy on the roof shooting at your soldierspolice officers with a boltaction rifle but you also blew apart the building killing families and children.A government agency killed  children in Waco Texas.  The government has no qualms about killing children.gtDefeating a populist uprising also means the government has to keep the people on its side in a popularity contest. If you start blasting away with tanks and drones and attack helicopters the contest is lost. People will side with the resistance.I disagree  see Syria.  Assad still has a popular following.  There was no popular resistance to rounding up the Japanese in the s and there are active calls for rounding up citizens who happen to be Muslims and Mexicans by federal forces.  It all depends on the spin.My point is that any meaningful or protracted civil war will be met with dire repercussions.

For further background the sights are Haley Strategic THRTEN tritium sights. While Haley is a bit of a meme at times I think he really hit it out of the park with these theyre very useful. But that isnt the point  Night sights are wonderful but if you cant see what youre shooting at all they arent necessarily all that useful. Towards that end a light is required. As flashlight nerds high lumen numbers are very attractive but in this case for certain purposes the HL may take it just a bit too far. With enough light any surface is a reflective surface and Ive found that even in reasonably well lit rooms this produces a lot of reflection and glare off even relatively matte surfaces like painted walls and furniture. I wouldnt recommend it for indoor use it will disorient you as much as anyone youre trying to illuminate. Outdoor use however may be a different story. Ill report back after a few camping trips.The green laser is of course incredible. Highly recommend that portion even if I cant fully endorse the HL.

Or did someone else in your family inherit it and now theyre giving it to you? If its the former then federal law allows transferring the gun to you with no background check. If its the latter federal law requires you to have the gun sent to a dealer in NJ and have them run the background check on you before you can pick it up. Thats because federal law doesnt allow private transferssales of firearms between residents of different states except in the case of an inheritance.Assuming youre a NJ resident youll need a FID before a gun store will transfer the shotgun to you.

11548274,0,t1_dg472ke,gt The second amendment says that the people have the right to keep and bear arms suitable for military useI agree that this is the way it should be but it is noteworthy that in Heller Scalia writes pp.gt ... the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendments ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia to be as effective as militias in the th century would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society  at large. Indeed it may be true that no amount of small arms could be useful against modernday bombers and tanks. But the fact that modern developments have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change  our interpretation of the right. Scalia is suggesting that the right extends to the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home irrespective of the suitability of such weapons to military service.That does not preclude the suitability interpretation but it doesnt entail it either.I agree that the the prefatory clause in announcing the purpose of the operative clause strongly suggests that the Second Amendment should be interpreted as to protect arms suitable for military use but that is not settled law nor would it be unreasonable to take the position outlined by Scalia in Heller without extending it to the stronger suitable for military use position that you and I prefer.,Firearms,dg4zzs7,1,t5_2ryez

Here we call it civil forfeiture.  The police take your possessions they dont charge you with a crime nor do they have to have evidence that you committed a crime all the officer has to claim is that he believes youre participating in criminal activity and they take your cash and property.  The police have confiscated billions using this method.  There have been cases where police have confiscated cash from people going to buy cars they bought on Ebay.  In one case the man showed he won the auction and was headed to that location.  The amount of money he carried matched the amount in the auction yet the officer confiscated his cash.  In another case a farmer was headed to a farm auction and carried cash with him.  A policeman pulled him over found the cash with a specially trained cash sniffing dog and confiscated it.  Why?  Because he had fast food wrappers in his farm truck and only had a single key in the ignition instead of a key ring.  The officer claimed this is typical of drug runners. In Texas officers were caught taking the jewelry of motorists with out of state tags.  In another case they told a family that if they didnt sign their car over to the police they were going to arrest them for drug running and they would never see their children again.  The key here is these victims rarely get their property or cash back and they are not charged with any crime. In a weird twist of the law the police are bringing legal action against the owners property so the property has no rights.   Since the confiscated money is nonappropriated funds the police departments may use it for whatever they choose.  Trips bonuses and in one case even a margarita machine. Look up civil forfeiture for more information.  ,Firearms,dgnyfjk,4,t5_2ryez
