3062459,0,t1_coenmwr,Clarke is at his best loping around between the m arcs. I have seen him produce some good football at CHF but his problem is kind of acceleration. Hes a pretty aerobic beast for such a big bloke but he doesnt have that kind of leading hard at the ball pace that a CHFkey forwardfull forwards need. And urgency seems to belong to a different language to him. Hes not Longmuir bad though. Now at the giant running link man job I think hes essentially wonderful. ,FremantleFC,coff5vd,1,t5_2vs9u

5035288,0,t3_3jv2bb,I grew up in Fremantle in a mainly WCE dominated school. There were some seasons that Id attend every home game and see just a handful if that of wins. Its so strange to be a winning team let alone minor premiers. I still double take when people praise the Dockers as finals contenders.This season has surpassed all expectation. Sitting pretty on the top of the ladder possible Brownlow medalist and best of all zero retirementcausing injuries. Its been like a dream and who better to share this wondrous fantasy than with everyone on here. The mods have been incredible and the insight shown by you lot including by many first year watchers is just phenomenal. So no matter what happens from now I have to chalk this season down as a success. Thanks everyone!,FremantleFC,cusxz9n,6,t5_2vs9u
5194932,0,t3_3m3hsa,Definitely we wanna try and make the atmosphere absolutely insane. Scare Hawthorn half to deaf and give our boys that extra lift. Also we have to keep chants going the whole game not just when weve scored a couple of goals.Also win or lose the very least we can do is stay to the very end and clap the boys off.

5686474,0,t1_cx1xvja,Would certainly be looking to take someone like Bonner Hibberd Burton or a McKay with our first pick but theres good chance that none of them will be available at that point. As its quite a shallow draft there probably wont be any obvious pick to go for with so ill probably be looking for a classy ball user for running off the half back as I feel that we need to be using our first pick on a player whos at least got quality skills. Theres a small chance Rioli might be available and Id certainly be happy to go after him if hes there.For our second pick id probably be looking at a one of the many tall defenders floating around someone like Skinner Glass McCasker Smith maybe Adams if hes there. Theres a chance we might have to reach for a player here but its a shallow draft so I dont think well be losing out too much.rd pick will obviously depend on whos still around if theres any obvious selection still available id take him but otherwise id be looking at filling the small forward role. If theres someone like Lovell whos slipped down due to his height id probably go after them as this club has definitely got a history of players overcoming there size.For th and th id  probably be starting to look at some of the mature age players floating around Brown Grimley Yarran Bootsma are all possibilities particularly with the th pick. Theres also a chance we could promote Taylor Smith with the th pick if we thought that was a better option over the mature age options. Otherwise its always a good idea to give a young WA kid a chance with the th pick. Schoenfield Smith perhaps even Menegola or Broad.th pick will be going to promoting Ethan Hughes.TLDR st Best available Focus on ball use if no obvious selections nd Tall defender best young or Adams rd Depends if anyones slipped through lean towards small forward or underrated mid a la Neale.thth Small forward mature age key pos player local lad with improvementth Rookie Promotions ,FremantleFC,cx1yngj,1,t5_2vs9u

7067768,0,t3_4c9n1i,Yeah not the greatest of games but hopefully itll be the signal Ross needs to change things up. Clancee Suban D Pearce and Mz shouldnt even be in this team low on skills and crap decision making. However they werent entirely alone. Our backline needs serious work I noticed during the Geelong NAB game this whole piss about in the back line with switches back and forth because no one could see an option or take a chance up forward. Saw it again on Sunday its frustrating to watch. I thought we were better than that. Overall though Id rather this happen early in the year to give the coaching staff time to tweek the game plan. Hopefully we can blood a few of the youngsters that we have coming through. ,FremantleFC,d1hhslu,3,t5_2vs9u

7422078,0,t1_d2ltwnh,If by rookies you mean first and second year players there is Weller he is the pretty one good outside midhalf forward. Blakely inside mid similar player to Mundy also looks kinda like him cept has brown hair and is shorter. Darcy tucker half back rebound defenderWingman has a weird looking kick but always seems to go where he wants it. Made some mistakes under pressure last week but to be expected from a first year player. Should do better this week.There is also third years Alex Pearce kpd similar build to Dustin Fletcher can swing forward but with Johnson out should be spending the entire game in defence.  And Brady Grey who is kinda a defensive utility type gives crazy preasure and tackles hard. ,FremantleFC,d2lubfe,3,t5_2vs9u

But yeh thats not a bad point he may be useful as trade bait a few years down the line when were into our rebuild and he has some value.

10560577,0,t1_dcr4pkt,If I gave you spoils and clangers would you be a happy Ross Lyon? If I could I would give you the Premiership but all I can do is just offer you my love.. AND MY FIST. Despite failing to ever meet the required skill standard to play AFL football Zachariah The Golden Fist Dawson has done exceedingly well in becoming the first AFL player to become a meme. Zac is an inspiration to young boys and girls all throughout Australia proving you dont need to be ripped to be an AFL player nor do you necessarilly have to be very fast or intelligent or even learn how to kick a ball as long as your biological dad is your coach and feels guilty for running out on you under the pretense of getting a pack of smokes leaving you abandoned at the local petrol station  you too can become an AFL footballer. Anyway to the point Zac attack will be  this year and out of a contract at seasons end. With a new emphasis on playing the kids for the sake of the teams future competition for spots have never been more hotly contested and priority will be placed with the less experienced players or even a straw scarecrow that would probably be a better key defender than Zac sadly leaving old mate Golden Fist on the outer. I only see him getting a game if he breaks the leg of our young promising key defender Alex Pearce. Oh fuck.A body like yours oughta be in jail cause its on the verge of being illegally bad at football.In an alternate universe Nick Suban comes home with a premiership medal that he means to hang on his wall but gets distracted and instead jumps on the bed for  hours while his wife reluctantly flicks on and off the lights a feat which is met with much wonder and awe from the  year old trapped in a  year olds body. Despite a damaging left boot and all the heart in the world Suban tends to go missing while in the midfield and often looks a little out of place during the game. With players such as Blakely Langdon Tucker Weller I dont see Suban getting a game this year even if he does bleed purple. Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing not different than the weekend before.Did you know that as well as being a professional sportsman Danyle Pearce is actually the Worlds greatest hideandgoseek champion a skill he often displays during many of Freos matches? After kicking an impossible goal on the run from m out Danyle likes to strip off his clothes and paint himself green only allowing himself back into the game when someone from the sidelines exclaims Ive found you you dirty rascal! A trait Ross found charming for  years but one some of the fans are getting a little tired of. Pearce is undoubtedly talented but is inconsistent with when he displays it. More inconsistency in  should see him on the outer.Honourable MentionsDespite everything noone can dictate who you are to other people. Unless its Ross dictating how shit you are at footy then yeh youre fucked fam.Hayden Ballantyne  About as charming as Donald Trump on The Bachelor the infamous small forward has caused quite a stir over the past  months with his rumoured request to be traded to cross town rivals West Coast as well a drop in the form that saw him All Australian in . His supposed lack of loyalty and general annoyingness dont make much of a case for him to stick around if he isnt playing well so it will be imperative for him to rediscover the form of old. A class above most small forwards when firing Ballantyne probably will be given more of a chance compared to the rest of the unlucky list. Cam Spudshed Sutcliffe  The speedy backman provides a bit of Xfactor down back but is ultimately let down by his atrocious disposal efficiency while on the run. And a real inability to shut down his opponent. Competition from Crozier Luke Ryan Weller Tucker Sheridan and Logue will probably force him out of the side sometime during the year. The question is whether he can have a breakout season strong enough to cement his place. Only  years old I still think the best of Cam is yet to come.Zac I love getting injured at festivals Clarke  The polarizing ruckman has been affected by a drop in form and injury since destroying his knee at a music festival after the  season a year that saw him relieve the ruck duties from an injured Sandi for most of the HA season and do a stellar job. Like everyone I love in Freo he got injured and has never been the same. Surgery at the end of  and hopefully more rehabilitation will hopefully see him become a dominant ruckman in the gam aaaaannndddd hes injured again.Matt Taberner  Perhaps a tad harsh including him here Tabs will find it hard breaking into the forward line over Apeness Kersten and McCarthy this year. A talented key forward Tabs has yet to be consistent through the duration of a season although has shown he can break a game open on his day. I think this season will be make or break for the young key forward and I hope he can get his mindset right perhaps the one thing restricting how consistent he can be.,FremantleFC,dd55sm1,3,t5_2vs9u

I would expect Tucker and Logue to probably drop out at the expense of Pearce and Sheridan.I am a firm believer that Taberner is just not that good and hasnt shown enough to be best  and I would much rather play Apeness.  I think the article leaving out Weller is a huge mistake and he will provide much needed dash and class of HB.
