52450,0,t3_1uoxgw,v is just too geared towards the competitive scene for me with its emphasis on players carrying out pre defined roles rather than just playing how they want.By that i mean in certain titles with low player counts each and every players actions count far more towards the overall result of the game than say for instance a game with many more players.I play titles like Battlefield with its  player count because i can do what i want without it overtly playing a role in the outcome of everybody elses game. If i want to remove myself from the direct combat and instead pilot a MAV and spend my time spotting enemy soldiers taking out enemy Cmines etc. then i can without anybody thinking that i am not pulling my weight. Similarly if i want to goof around and lay traps for enemy players by mining or Cing a bridge and drawing their tanks into my trap then i can without it being a big deal.There are a lot more opportunities to do stuff for fun in larger scale games than there are in smaller scale ones because your individual responsibility is much less.It is why i have always stayed clear of the smaller MP titles even stuff like Left  Dead i found becoming something less than fun because one screw up would see people losing their shit. It stopped being a game to play for fun and became something you felt like you had to play seriously. ,gamernews,cekegxc,20,t5_2sc3f

124501,0,t1_ceslqzq,gt Because by that point you couldnt compete with any other modern D games in visual fidelity.Simply not true. Take any game you have at max settings. Note the frame rate. Now drop the settings until you get twice the frame rate you had before. Is it significantly worse looking? Yes. Does it still look like the same game with graphics that still look current compared to max settings? Absolutely. The changes are significant but not significant enough to make the game look out of place. The point is to get the graphics to look as good as they possibly can. The fact is if you use fps no matter the console or PC the graphics simply arent as good as they can possibly get.gtGames dont utilize fixed camera and incredibly narrow FOVs use varying lens for varying shots nothing about panning tilting and tracking are the same between the two and if a movie or show for even a tiny amount of time or infrequently used sweeping constantly moving cameras which in any way replicated even somewhat look mechanics in any D games fps would be a goddamn nightmare.Games absolutely use increasingly cinematic camera angles and techniques but none of that really makes much of a difference for frame rate and how it affects how motion looks.gtMiniatures and soaps look nothing like a game and one of the only reasons people perceive that shit as moving too fast is because weve been acclimated our entire lives to take in all of our video around  frames.I just explained to you why thats not the only reason. Scientifically even. Want me to go more in depth?When filming miniatures you HAVE to film in slow motion or it just wont look right. Why? Well lets take for example a miniature object that is dropped from one foot high. This miniature object is meant to represent a large object dropped from a height of  ft. If you film both in real time the larger object will take x the time to fall as the miniature. Therefore you film the miniature at th the speed to make the motion seem realistic for an object the size of which its trying to represent. Smaller speeds make objects look larger and more impressive and the same effect applies to frame rates. Higher frame rates make things look smaller and less impressive. Not because of acclimation to lower frame rates but because of the science behind how we perceive the motion of larger and smaller objects. Artistically speaking a separation from reality in the form of a smaller frame rate can make people places and things look larger than life to feel out of this world. Its an artistic technique that allows us to be taken away from reality into the world were watching and it falls apart at higher frame rates. Higher frame rates feel real and are cool to look at but you dont get the same kind of separation from reality effect because of it.gtWhy would you even bring up screen interpolation features? Not even remotely the same thingIts all about the motion of objects. Whether you filmrender the objects natively at a higher frame rate or interpolate them to a higher frame rate you still get the same motion. gtDo you even play games at  fps before speaking shit like this or are you going off the evertypical YouTube knowledge?I play all my PC games at fps. I have sometimes limited my framerate to fps because I felt fps ruined the cinematic experience. But again thats only in cinematically styled games. Arcade type games or games that require fast reaction times work best at fps.,gamernews,ceslxo9,1,t5_2sc3f

My cousin has a  rig he built last year that runs a pretty solid fps with new games on his p monitor.Technically it is anything with approximately  pixels worth of horizontal resolution.To run something like Battlefield  at k resolution even a GTX  TI will only get  fps ish on medium settings.A  GTX TI runs at around  for the cheaper models and upwards of  for the faster ones from the likes of EVGA etc.To run modern games at k resolution at their highest settings you basically need thousands of pounds just for the rig itself then another couple of thousand pounds for the monitor capable of displaying k.It is an incredibly niche market right now something to look forward to maybe  years down the line for the average PC gamer but only the type of PC gamer who can literally afford to upgrade their rigs every couple of months just because they can rather than because they actually needed to should be looking at proper high end k gaming in the near future.Not to mention that if you look at the reviews of the k monitors we have now they all tend to have some pretty big downsides because the tech is so new yeah you can run out and buy one right now for  but other than its sheer resolution advantage a decent  p monitor is going to have better response times colour contrast brightness etc.,gamernews,cfwqtnw,2,t5_2sc3f

Then the following April Lucasfilm fired the majority of Lucasarts staff leaving only about  behind as a skeleton crew and changed its model into a licensing model. Thats when Star Wars  was shitcanned.Disney was closing a lot of studios and backing off the videogame market while focusing on Disney Infinity.Lucasfilm said it closed LucasArts with the goal of minimizing the companys risk while achieving a broader portfolio of quality Star Wars games which is basically we want the games and the profit but we dont want to fork up the cash and develop them as its a risk.So now theyre saying Production on  and First Assault has stopped and those games will be released only if another publisher signs on to complete them. which is its current model. They own the trademarks and are waiting for someone to want to pay to develop it.Luckily though thats what DICE did so as far as I know development of Star Wars Battlefront the reboot is still going as its not lucasarts that is developing that they just own the license.,gamernews,cgqkgrh,1,t5_2sc3f

Literally nothing you said in that post barely indicates at all why you think its bad.Have I seen things that makes me think the game is good? Of course I have we all have. Everyone in this WatchDogs sucks camp completely ignores gameplay and instead only fixates on graphics and blows up miscommunications out of proportion. They gameplay weve seen in my opinion is good enough to warrant this game some credit which youve given none of it.I am not going to preorder WatchDogs and I wont buy it until I see how it turns out but Im like that with most games. Am I optimistic about it? Sure I guess so but I can see enough in the game to know that you shouldnt just dismiss it for whatever reason.

The lens flare went away once the other effects went away. As I said. It made the game flatter.The fact you have these two different rendering styles is probably because of two different groups.

1732955,0,t1_cjxhv8s,Oh definitely. Imagine thisFor centuries after the fall of Arthedain the Dunedain and their Chieftains have guarded the North. Feared and distrusted by locals a few hundred Dunedain stand between Breelands calm idyll and the howling wolves roving bandits wights and goblins that live in the wilderness where once the Numenorean kings ruled.You play as Arathorn son of Arador of the Dunedain raised by Elrond in Rivendell. Word has reached you that your father is missing captured by Hilltrolls and you must now set out across the wild North to seek his freedom. You eventually fail arriving to find him dead and the trolls long since disappeared after fighting your way across the hostile wilderness. There are signs that the trolls have not simply wandered off but been summoned  a summons they felt compelled to answer. This mystery worries you greatly as the Hilltrolls are usually disorganized and unruly. Who could bring them into line so easily?A year later your son Estel is born. Shortly thereafter word comes to you from other Rangers of the North who tell you of a threat growing in the ruins of Carn Dum former seat of the WitchKing during the days of the northern Kingdoms. You head north to Angmar where you find darkness stirring. A great orchorde rises in the ruins gathered by an unnaturally intelligent troll of massive size which calls itself the Ologhai. Along the road two fears battle within you one of leaving your son without a father and another of the great Kingdoms being washed away before the onslaught of the Ologhai.Battling and stealthing your way through you gather weapons of your forefathers from the shores of Lake Evendim a great bow an ancient Elven dagger and a shield of Numenorean steel. Orcs profane the ruins of Annminas and you make them regret this. But something troubles you. If the Ologhai has already gathered so many what good can one sword do? Is there any hope?Eventually you reach Carn Dum and infiltrate it after sending away your compatriots telling them to prepare for the storm to come and that evil is growing. You tell them that it is their duty to die in the defense of the innocents of the North just as you expect to die. But miraculously you survive and are able to set the orcs to fighting each other allowing you to kill the Ologhai.As it happens on your return from Carn Dum you are waylaid by orcs and slain with a stray arrow through the eye. A random party one you did not sense through the bloodhaze that clouded your flight from Carn Dum. As your life spills out you see with the eyes of death that the way of the sword cannot long avail your people and that your son shall be the last Chieftain of the Dunedain. You die in despair.Estel is told of your death and sent to Rivendell for safety as the orcs grow in boldness in hunting the Dunedain. Someone comments on his name which means Hope. His mother replies that no longer shall he be known by that name for though he is still the hope of her heart men will not follow that alone. The guardian to whom she speaks nods knowingly and calls for the boy to follow using his proper name Aragorn.,gamernews,cjxlqhs,10,t5_2sc3f

I swear everyone and their dog in the gaming community was getting a DS.The absolute worst followup they could do for this boost in sales was announce a fragmentary upgrade within a year of those sales boosts.  The systems been out for a while now yes but the first year or so were dismal for it.   A huge chunk of people just joined the bandwagon within the last year or just a further back and the gaming market is NOT as tolerant as the smartphone market for quick turn arounds.

2083097,0,t1_cl4ldd5,Thats funny because for a lot of people fps isnt playable just like fps isnt playable for others. If were going to state that its subjective whether fps or fps looks better then we can say the same for fps or fps being playable. In fact you can argue that a lot of common agreed upon things are still subjective and youd be right. The problem here is that Ubisoft claims they know whats best for us and speaks on behalf of everyone when they lock it to fps. At that point they themselves change it from being an opinion to claiming its a fact and give us no choice in the matter. ,gamernews,cl4lva9,14,t5_2sc3f

2130807,0,t3_2j85fr,In my own opinion the gameplay mechanics could really use work. The parkour system as in vaulting sprinting climbing could use slight fixes mostly the vaulting though as some things that should be vaultable are not the sprinting and climbing could be left as is I suppose with work only to make the actions more polished and clean. Also the fact that the game lacks a avoiding or counter option does take away some of the fighting or action aspect.However for those who I believe the game was intended for hardcore horror gamers this game is a gem. I do love the originality and creativeness of the plot. The cutscenes are masterfully designed to pull you deeper into the game. The graphics and monstercharacter design is done to perfection as every vile creature truly does invoke an amount of fear. The minor characters development could be better but the main protagonist which honestly is what most the like good character development care about leaves nothing to be desired by those who love character development.Conclusion Im personally one into the story more than the gameplay but the gameplay is God awful in some cases and leaves a LOT of room for improvement. I was very excited for this game since it would hopefully be a AAA title horror game for the NextGen Consoles only to be let down by less than NextGen gameplay. The graphics are up to par and the monsters were all very well textured and terror infused creatures.GSGGameplay Story Graphics ,gamernews,clao7xg,3,t5_2sc3f

We find out later that Ada Wong is behind these outbreaks and general bad shit going down worldwide but as it turns out its not actually Ada Wong but someone who was turned into Ada Wong through some freaky science. The man responsible for that happening is Derek Simmons who basically forced some woman that had the hots for him to go through the transformation process because Ada dont want him. When all is said and done Simmons goes huh you know what I actually prefer the real thing and since the transformation is irreversible that woman is...understandably upset. Later on we find out that this woman posed as Ada and caused everything in Resident Evil  in order to destroy her real Ada Wong image. All so she could spite Simmons for having really intense Yellow Fever.I may have skimmed over a few details but thats what I took away from finishing the story.

I get what youre trying to say but claiming that those terms are arbitrary is totally ignorant. No I was actually raised in it and miss those days where beta wasnt even in the average gamers dictionary.Obviously the words indicate levels of completion Im not stupid. What Im saying is one mans alpha is another mans beta is another mans release. These words mean significantly less in the age of early access because games can remain in beta for years and never reach completion i.e. DayZ. Thats the reality of some games theyre too large and ambitious to not be stuck in beta.gtThere are plenty of games that are done when they come out and there are games that come out early that you can buy in alpha while waiting for the game to finish. Those terms are very very relevant because they are related to what expectations the consumer can legally expect. Why do you think I dont know this? This is some incredibly patronizing shit.gtDayZ has been in alpha a lot longer than I think anyone expected.  People have all the right in the world to be grumpy that the game wont be declared finished for potentially  more years. Why? The game is extremely ambitious and smaller games have taken longer. Being allowed to play unfinished games makes us painfully aware of how long game design takes. I knew what I was getting into with DayZ especially if the mod was any indication. Others can make the same kind of game faster but those games arent DayZ.But please insult me more.,gamernews,cme09hx,5,t5_2sc3f

Art is the avenue through which we can explore every aspect of life the ugly ones as well as the beautiful ones in a completely safe way. This is why censorship is arts arch nemesis. No subject should be beyond art because every subject  no matter how shocking  has the potential to reveal profound things about the universe in the hands of a great artist.

2596133,0,t1_cmxfzta,I mentioned in another thread why I felt is was different than games like Postal GTA and manhunt. The killing isnt for survival or satire. Its unapologetic killing for killings sake. Unfortunately Valve doesnt have all the power here. If the mainstream media catches wind of the game which they probably wont because its distributed digitally they might run with it to create more GTAlike exposes on violent videogames. Valve being the sole distributor would receive alot of negative press. What Valve could do is simply not distribute the game on US servers. Although that would prevent Valve from receiving alot of negative press it would make them look compromising and weak. They could also simply not host the game on the grounds that its more of a commentary artistic statement than anything. Even if they went that route others would simply bring up the many visual novels Valve hosts. Its a tricky situation but I think its important to remember that the only one with anything to lose here is Valve. Its easy to talk about moral absolutes and freedom of speech when one isnt the one in the line of fire. ,gamernews,cmxg9lc,1,t5_2sc3f

2657609,0,t1_cn5h0nx,Then they need to completely restructure how their server infrastructure works which would invalidate existing games based on that infrastructure making any online functionality not work without developers patching their games to match it.Steam needs to worry less because Dedicated servers are less of a problem and patches can be made frequently without developers needing to contact Valve. If you want to push a patch for a game on consoles you have to contact Microsoft or Sony and it has to get reviewed. So youre comparing a network being down for a day or two twice or three times a year to spending billions and hoping that developers also update their games to account for these changes probably at their cost. Meanwhile when the network goes back up people just go back to playing like it never happened. But if they could never play their game again because the developer didnt want to pay to patch the game to fit the new server infrastructure? Youd be LIVID. This is of course presuming a lot. We have a lot of information about the setup Valve has and much much less about MSSony. Like maybe they host their content servers on separate servers from their dedicated servers separate from their matchmaking server separate from their front facing storefront. Or maybe its all on a single dell in a closet somewhere. And to suggest oh just copy them well its not just like you can copypaste server code.

As an mmo player I hated the experience because it was exactly like mmo questing and the large amount of quests etc it just sucked to me I havent revisited borderlands because of this. I never liked it because there was so much walking pointless quests and back tracking. I think the game would fit very well as an mmo with people it already felt like an empty one. Ive tried to play this game  times with friends and without I always fail to get anywhere especially if I play it alone. Game is like a dead mmo with no real content besides questing. Go here then go there then here then there. Ugh I really hated borderlands and I thought itd be a good game. I honestly think itl work better in this format if its the same concepts as the original games with people thatd definitely breathe some life and flavor into a game that to me was really only lacking this aspect.

There will also likely be a large crowd of people complaining about the depth of the in game mechanics. If theres one thing Ive learned from watching games is that a game cant do everything with lots of depth. I think there is a quote by Todd Howard of Bethesda to that effect. My pet theory is that there will be a ton of people disappointed with how the promised feature isnt as fun or rewarding as they had been told. The devs will have spoken accurately and the promised feature will be in the game but people wont be satisfied with it.

Crysis Multiple save game slots were A  however the slots of save games needed more information not just the gameplay time. Each savegame should list chaos earned ammo weapons spawn location and money in pocket.  I fear that in order to appeal to the console players  the savegame slots will be ditched looking at you Watch Dogs.   The entire system of the helicopter delivery redneck needs ditched.  Unfortunately rumor has it that the entire monetary system of the world is being discarded.  This is a hint to  me that Avalanche is removing the RPG elements and  taking the gameplay towards a more linear storyline with greater emphasis on missions.I predict that the system of finding every last item in a city in order to complete those areas will be scrapped by Avalanche. That was finding needles in a haystack both time consuming and difficult.JC  had a lot to learn from COD regarding shooting mechanics.

4451547,0,t1_csrsf9j,I see your point and I agree. However we are seeing something similar to this with mobile games. Mobile games are becoming more popular than traditional handheld gaming. Mobile games use the the microtransactions paradigm to make most of their profile. Im nervous about the paradigm that would be used. However this may not become an issue. Are you not concerned about how Microsoft make take advantage of this? I know there are alternatives for OS but Windows is the most developed and supported OS. Can we trust Microsoft not to take advantage of all games being released on the PC?Finally I see a high increase in PC gaming including both hardware and software. One of the reasons we get Steams summer and winter sale is because PC gaming is the minority of the gaming world. These sales are meant to get PC gamers to buy their game. Im not saying that PC gaming is small or not increasing. If these sales and others didnt exist would PC gaming be as big as it is now? One of the motivations to get into PC gaming is the saleslow price of games. How do I know that the price of PC games or the lack of sales will exist if PC dominated the gaming industry ?,gamernews,csrswau,2,t5_2sc3f

4625246,1,t1_ctdhd47,Well  since we are arguing about whether you win or not by paying Ill let you know my point.  First of all this is not a plane fling  game even  is a point where you want the plane to go and it will. The thing is that most people play using these arcade controls  which make it sort of a point and shoot mechanic in which flying skills are not necessarily needed. Therefore gun power and maneuverability make the real difference between wining and loosing.  These two can be bought early in the game with real money...  So pay to win after all... ,gamernews,ctdl31b,2,t5_2sc3f

Star Citizen is another good example.Its a shame its been so long since we had a good Star Wars flying game. After Jump to Lightspeed I was gutted with the onrails space combat they shoehorned into SWTOR.

Its truely a style of pokemon game weve been asking for for a long time.

7186263,0,t3_4dvs2b,I find the animosity surrounding this game really disheartening. I thought it was powerful emotionally engaging stuff. I wish more titles had the bravery and ambition to approach narrative as boldly as this. Every time the term walking simulator is thrown around it feels like a lazy attack on innovation within the medium. The term game isnt really helpful... a clunkier but more accurate description would be interactive narrative experience. Its a mistake to install this expecting the challenge you might find in a more traditional game... I think the frustration some players feel comes from the their experience not aligning with misplaced expectations. The dialogue and environment all feel authentic and its a beautiful evocation of a British village on a summers day. The narrative is unconventional but it really is not challenging all the game asks of the player is an open mind. If you dont want to approach the game with this mentality then theres really no shame in it just play something else!

The least they could do is add some sort of paragon level like Diablo  has. Which allows you to gain little perks overtime forever and it greatly improves a players ability to play the same shit over and over. gt You arent even to the first power bro.

People like their decisions to have an impact on the story so maybe thats one way to do it.Mass Effect  did an interesting job on some of this with the whole Readiness thing. Completing sidequests gave you additional military resources that can help in the final battle. Not enough of them and you can automatically fail. Mixing a mechanic like that with some timesensitive choices and youd have a very interesting game. Sure you want to save the pretty girl but that only gives you  points.

Its slower bigger battlefields more emphasis on team work and map control.Titanfall has wormed its way into CoDs stomping ground as a great fast paced shooter where player skill and reactions are rewarded much more than they are in battlefield. CoD honestly feels plodding slow and stiff compared to it. I know TF might not have sold gangbusters but its totally replaced CoD in my mind this being the first year Call of Duty actually looked interesting.

10137289,0,t1_dbsp8za,Aww dont be mean. Whats wrong with legitimate discussion? Especially one so interesting and important. Just so were clear I hope Star Citizen succeeds and Im on the verge of buying a starter pack. I just want to make some sense of whats going on with the game. I consider myself objective and Im open to someone swaying my skepticism but all I see from you are personal attackscalling an argument bad stating something that doesnt have anything to do with the argument and moving on. Is it possible that CryEngine was the wrong choice for this project? Is it possible that CIG will spend all of their time and resources trying to fix CryEngine and not even enough left to actually build a game? Is fixing map sizes an accomplishment? Yes. Does it address any of my concerns? No. Chris Roberts said they have enough money to finish the game. Chris Roberts said . and Squadron  would release in . Should we be concerned that Chris who is responsible for budgeting and planning the game seems to be grossly off in his progress estimates? What if hes budgeting for  years of development but the project really needs  years before a viable product can be released that will drive new revenue. Why is running out of funding not even remotely possible? Do you have any idea what CIGs yearly operating costs are? Do you have any idea how much money they currently have left? Are you even a little curious as to why they invest so much time in running ship sales and engaging in questionable sale behavior for more money? If the  million dollars they have is really this unquestionable well that will absolutely fuel development to completion shouldnt all resources focus on finishing Squadron  and .?Are you at all concerned that NO gameplay from Squadron  has been shown at this point?Again Im a passionate fan of what Star Citizen could be I want to join up but when I see responses like yours I remain skeptical. Im just curious as someone hesitant to spend  how much have you invested in Star Citizen? ,gamernews,dbsw5ia,0,t5_2sc3f

Im assuming the short end will happen as technology is becoming more powerful and cheaper than it ever has before.
