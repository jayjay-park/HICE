39845,0,t3_1ui73v,George Reeves was my first experience of Superman. And one of the major reasons I still love the character  years on.  He was an amazing Superman particularly in the early episodes.  He had an edge to him and a confidence and sincerity in his performance.  Playing Superman back then was not the big deal it is now this would have been a difficult gig for him in many ways but he always gave a great performance.,superman,ceiyttg,2,t5_2qrwe
53417,0,t1_cekhyla,I believe that the Kryptonians are colorblind based on the fact that every single viewscreen is in black and white and all of their clothing and architecture features very dull muted colors. For example JorEl wears Supermans exact costume except that it doesnt have a cape and the colors are very muted the blue is much darker and the shield is practically brown. Even the gold in the councils outfits is dull. JorEl seems to be the only person interested in mixing colors into his outfits being the only person I think to use blue in his clothing. That we see anyway. I figure this is all because of their shitty red sun which would make sense if Earths yellow sun opens up their visual bandwidth. I dont think thats the case though because otherwise Clark would have been able to see through walls all the time even before the incident where he hides in the closet. I think the nature of the light itself lets anyone Kryptonian or not see a wider range of colors and that the actual supervision comes from the air. Clark has trouble breathing until hes in grade school around the time that he develops supersenses Zod is unable to see through walls until he is exposed to Earths oxygen.

As such although Smallville influenced a few changes in the Superman backstory like the addition of Chloe Sullivan to the cannon before the New  as of now with the Smallville comic being published Smallville is at best an alternate universe standalone.

842106,0,t3_23qk7s,I think the publishers finally blinked in their decades long stare down with the Superman naysayers. In a comic universe where almostevery Iconic hero with his own book was brimming with selfconfidence clarity of vision and unquestionable conviction Superman still stood apart as the moral compass in whatever pantheon he stood beside. Brilliant billionaire businessmen fearless test pilot scientist princess near omniscient magical beings  it didnt matter If Superman was for something you were for it too. Not that any of those other heroes needed that affirmation but once you had Superman on your side you couldnt lose. You could believe in the goals of the mission at hand. The good writers made sure that this wasnt because he was supremely strong fast and invulnerable. The ultimate Trump card!  The He can do anything therefore he is boring  No the same people who make that claim are telling you that if they were handed ultimate power they know it would change them for the worse. If I had Supermans powers Id blah blah blah blah  Well thats right you would impose your will on your environment and the world because its not the powers that make Superman who he is its his convictions his morals and his restraint that cast that long shadow over all the other heroes in the DC Universe.  Decade after decade as new writers started to deconstruct the genre by ultra Marvelizing all the heroes giving them phobias personal drama eccentric quirks mental trauma on top of the burden of being a hero Superman still stood separate from that.  You dont want a Superman haunted by a childhood tragedy that has him waking up angry every morning. You dont want a Superman who fights the urge to get a drink when things are tense. You dont want a Superman who feels that justice trumps the Law in certain cases.Supermans psyche starts and ends with benevolence. When almost every powerful human with a bit of power or influenceBe it political financial spiritual is shown to  eventually lose their soul to itThe guy in the red cape with all the power stands apart to show you that with wisdom willpower and optimism we can all be better. Its not easy for us its not easy for Kryptonians either being good and having restraint isnt a yellow sun based power. It comes from the gut and the heart. So now the new  Superman is part Clark Kent and part Peter Parker he questions himself and worries too much. The other heroes dont automatically assume his answers are the right one. They bicker and waste time with pissing contests.  ,superman,ch000lu,4,t5_2qrwe

1640411,0,t3_2d3jkl,Dont be shy about your podcast! A common complaint is that hes hard to write......because of the criticisms from those disinclined against Superman but also because of the expectations of some of Supermans greatest fans.  That fandom can manifest itself in a way where their mental image of Superman is crystallized into something so specific that any deviation is an affront to the character.  That can be an issue with power levels characterization canonicity visual variations etc.  The level of expectation that those who love Superman bring to consuming related media for a creator is going to be magnitudes higher than say Guardians of the Galaxy... who?DC overall has been relatively consistent stewards of the icon moreso than other popular characters which may undergo more radical changes on a more regular basis but with that consistency comes the ability for some to hold things more sacred than with more routinely revamped characters.  That makes making changes tough... either no one buys it anticipating a return to the status quo or you are making a dramatic change and have to deal with the consequences of it for example maybe the general rejection of your attempt to modify the icon... despite Returns being a major motion picture the idea that Superman has a son born out of wedlock doesnt immediately spring to mind as a core element of the character.,superman,cjlxsx7,2,t5_2qrwe

Only a handful of characters created since  have made it and almost every single big gun was created in the s or before. There are many original black heroes but they dont sell because they were created after the establishment was set.

1936253,0,t3_2gtuut,I was really worried going into it since I a grown man cry every time I watch the Reeves movies wasnt going to experience the same emotions that Superman has given me my whole life. A family that saved him from destruction out of pure love and hope and an adoptive family that would shape him into something humble and human. To me Man of Steel got that before he put on the cape they had convinced me that this guy was worthy to wear the outfit. The whole JorEl sequence was badass and I was saddened to see him die that way. I was a little worried about the stance Jonathan Kent Costner took on Clark showing the world who he really was it felt to me like he wasnt as ALL moral as the Jonathan from other incarnations but I began to think that this was a different time a time where every nation is on edge and if we found out there were aliens among us everyone would scramble and freak out. I think he was more trying to get Clark to make the choice at the right time on his terms. Diane Lane as Martha was my favorite casting choice. The scene with her and Clark in school brought me to tears it was just such a powerful and terrifying moment in his life and she got him to calm down.Henry Cavill was great. He was very convincing once he put on the costume after i rewatch I like his Clark Kent but his Superman was fantastic.Zod was awesome but this part of the film I invest less in than the moments with his parents. Im with people that there was just too much destruction Im not mad at it but it was super over the top but I think its going to be a good way the bridge all the other superheroes together cause lets face it we are all excited to see Batman and Superman and all the other guys and gals together on the big screen. Weve only had cartoons up to this point Im ready to see a Justice League movie already!Sorry for the long rant!,superman,ckmib34,5,t5_2qrwe

2750136,0,t1_cnfh7ef,Nah.  Supes is way way faster but he has to take his environment into account in a way that Flash doesnt... so Flash is faster on planets with populated areas and Supes is faster everywhere else.  Id say that Flash is quicker though.  Takes Supes concentration to do what comes to Flash naturally.Comic book physics apply so energy expenditure doesnt and Flash tends to have a nasty habit of getting sucked into the Speed Force or sucked into a time warp when he travels FTL.  Supes doesnt have that issue.,superman,cngog86,1,t5_2qrwe

2926403,0,t3_2tmvxb,gt At the same time though a simple moment here or there focusing on substance over flash would have went a long way. Honestly I think the film has substance that people arent willing or able to recognize so theyre focused on cosmetic changes without understanding the substance underneath.  I agree the changes would result in less polarized response but at the expense of the substance driving the scenes.gt Remove the kiss between Supes and Lois at ground zero...instead of forcing a romantic moment here have Superman searching through the rubble using X Ray vision to locate people and his other powers to save them.The kiss wasnt romantic.  It wasnt meant to be.  It was clumsy awkward and contained bad jokes.  It was an intentional send up of Superman s Can You Read My Mind which launched into an impossible Ill turn back time for you love at first sight.The MOS moment is just Im really attached to you. which is all that is necessary to kiss.Making that moment about stemming collateral damage is judging a dayold rookie by the standards of a seasoned superhero.  The fact that he doesnt reinforces the point that the film has insisted upon.  The first name we know KalEl by on Earth is Greenhorn said three times over... the filmmakers are literally yelling at the audience to get this point yet hes continually judged by a body of experience he doesnt have.gt Have a child or innocent person stuck under some debris and while Jonathans foot is stuck have Clark go to help him but Jonathan orders him to help those people Jonathan then dies and Clark couldnt save everyone.Absolutely not.  That completely undermines the reason Clark doesnt becomes Superboy.  In the truck prior Jonathan admits his best hasnt been enough and had he lived they would have explored Clarks options together... likely spawning a protoSuperboy.The problem with allowing Jonathan a glorious death one for the sake of other lives is thats exactly the kind of death Clark can have peace with and move on... My dad died saving lives.  Something he can proudly and even publicly proclaim.  Instead knowing his dad died for him with a secret reason increases the significance of the scene.  Its something Clark has to carry alone in secret and may have difficulty raising even with Martha... sending him on his journey of selfdiscovery.If Jonathan died for others Clark can settles into an ordinary life or become Superboy.  The death has little to nothing to do with Clark.  Even if Clark hadnt been there the same thing would have happened.Instead Jonathan dies for a uncertain abstraction specifically FOR Clarks sake... but merely to buy Clark more time before he debuts.  The scene is intentionally ambiguous and NOT clear cut in order to create in the audience the same questions that Clark had to wrestle with for the next  years.He has the security and absolute certainty that his father loves him and died for him to have a great purpose believing that Clark needs more time to fulfill it... but at the same time his father died specifically because it wasnt time yet.  Unlike a death where Jonathan dies gloriously for others without anything to do with Clark this sacrifice is specifically for Clark and for his own good.  That means Clark cant just move past it and discard it.He cant just settle down and be a farmer or journalist because Jonathan believes he has a greater destiny... one that even if it takes your whole life you owe it to yourself to find out what that is... at the same time he cant just become Superboy because that would be spitting in the face of his fathers sacrifice meant to buy time.  Clarks inaction would also drive this question continually in his mind again the ambiguity Could I have done something differently?  Was my father wrong?  The oil rig rescues shows that Clark hasnt abandoned his calling but neither has he abandoned Jonathans sacrifice.It was deftly constructed to create a logical psychology for someone who aspires for and is promised greatness but has to wait.Clarks still asking himself these questions  years later which is why he relates the story to Lois and then asks What do you think?  The question isnt just a hypothetical its very much a live question for him hes asking Is it finally time yet?  Turns out both Lois and Perry actually agree with Jonathan and say that it isnt time... but circumstances end up changing that answer.The tornado scene teaches everything the heart attack teaches plus the idea that entanglements and attachments can bind up Supermans power just as much as circumstances can.  That wont pay off in MOS but in will in BvS and beyond.  It helps explain and provide us with an explanation for why Superman focuses primarily on America and accepts nonintervention into other sovereign nations that dont want him interfering.If Superman is purely utilitarian America on its worst day is still miles better than many nations on their best... so youd never see Superman in Metropolis hed purely be a tool in foreign lands.  However the tornado scene means Superman accepts that attachment will bind up his powers but that it is still better to have attachment than not.gt That being said maybe dont have him crash through a  and bring the fight to Smallville. The fight in Metropolis was unpreventable but the Smallville one could have been a little less destructive. It seems intellectually dishonest to claim you empathize with inexperience but then ask him to act seasoned and competent beyond his experience and situation.  Again the filmmakers are conveying his inexperience by actually showing him to be inexperienced!  It would be bizarre for the film to call him Greenhorn for Faora and Zod to call out his lack of training and then show him acting like hes been at this for  years.Until the American military start firing theres no reason for Clark to even suspect a battle was going to occur or what the scope of it would be.  Punching Zod was literally the first time hes raised his fists in anger.gt Also when Zod kicks the tanker into Superman in Metropolis have him stop it instead of hopping over it and having it crash into the building behind him and totally annihilate the base of a skyscraper.This is counterfactual.  It crashed into a short parking deck where only one side collapsed the structure is still completely standing when we last see it.gt  Memorial for those lost in the attack...this will most likely be addressed in B v S but theres a part of me that thinks they are including this due to the outcry. There most definitely should have been a part of the film in which there is a memorial for the deaths of the citizens people who are fans and people who are critical of Superman and perhaps just one scene of Superman looking over the destruction with tears in his eyes and vowing to better. HUGE missed opportunityTheres no need for falling action because all it would do is precipitate further questions and desires for more reaction that go beyond the scope of THIS story.  You say it yourself it will be in BvS.  Moreover it completely misses the point of the last three scenes and why they are tonally so different.  Supermans born.  Hes here.  The uncertainty and the unanswered questions of Jonathans death are gone and addressed.  Jonathan was right... absolutely right.  If he hadnt waited he never would have been prepared or able to defeat Zod.Whereas the tornado situation was unclear muddy abstract and involved Clark holding back... against Zod Superman gave his all in a clear situation... he gave up his privacy his secret his Command Key and the last remnant of that father his starship any hope of reconciliation with his people and even his own innocence... like many servicemen before him... which would leave him marked certainly and with compassion for the lost of course but also secure in the knowledge that he did the right thing.  That knowledge would be reaffirmed every time he saw his mother his girlfriend his new city where he could finally set down roots... every time he went to his new and exciting career and answered the calling he had waited his whole life to fulfill.The last three scenes intentionally show us a Superman of a different disposition because he has justifiable reason to be different... a memorial scene would merely be extending the uncertain adolescence of who he was before Superman.,superman,co0qpjg,27,t5_2qrwe

2966578,0,t3_2u4edy,All Star Superman is considered the best Superman story of all time and I dont disagree but in my opinion you need to have been exposed to a lot of Superman material before reading it. Its a love letter to the character and his history so if you are a newer fan and havent had a thorough experience with Superman than it might not be as rewarding of an experience for you.Thats just me though and Im saying this because Im a newer Superman fan and I felt a little out of the loop when I read it. I plan on reading it again once Ive done my time so to speak. Just something to think about. I thought Earth One was mediocre all around. You should still read it to have something to discuss with other fans though cause its talked about often.Kingdom Come is currently my favorite Superman story that Ive read so far.

6998663,0,t1_d18ytt8,Well up until Superman and Zod flew through the  it was a really good film mainly because of its focus on developing the Superman mythos. After that it almost fully transformed into a generic summer blockbuster too often featuring dialogue and writing that was silly and apparently lacked any thought the fight scene with the world engine or Clark and Lois kissing in the middle of the city with presumably thousands of dying people nearby. Im happy to give you more examples. Thats not to say there werent some cool parts in the second half of the film but they were very few and far between.Zod was a pretty big letdown too. He got his ass kicked by JorEl at the beginning of the film and by Clark halfway through and so it was difficult to take him seriously as a villain going forward.Other than that the the flying looked too animated at parts the repeatedly used zoomin effect really ruined the immersion and the stabs at humour nearly always fell flat. ,superman,d19n4g4,3,t5_2qrwe

Where did you get your information? The movie grossed over million as of today. They didnt shatter any records and absolutely were it not for the bad reviews it could have done better but by no means did it do poorly. And yes I understand to reiterate that the movie received bad reviews but as Snyder said this was a movie for the fans not the critics. . on IMDB  rotten tomato fan rating . user rating on metacritic. At worst the. movie was average according to fans. Those arent  ratings which are usually considered exceptional I get that but also not bad by any standard.

8120173,0,t3_4q6q4b,First I want to say thank you. Thank you for making a podcast about Superman. I find it difficult to find quality Productions when looking at Superman Podcasts. If I may be so bold as to offer you some constructive criticism I would like to say a few things. Your title is fantastic. Supes On is a great name for a podcast and Im jealous that I didnt think of it. I like the concept of using the podcast to explore if any particular work is a good way to introduced a non fan to Superman and show that he is not boring. Its a great way to explore all the different Superman stories out there. It reminds me of a Star Trek podcast I listen to called Misson Log. However I think you guys are trying to pull too many gimmicks into the show. I personally think you can lose the drinking game aspect. One you got a great gimmick with the Supes On Supes Off that I dont think you need the drinking game to also explain what is good or bad about the topic. Also and maybe this is just me but I hold Superman with a certain amount of reverence and I think a lot of other fans do too.   And if he where a real person I dont think he would be promoting a drinking game of any sort. Dont get me wrong I drink...a lot. And I love a good dick and fart joke as much as the next guy but I also feel that if someone is talking about Superman in a way to show that he is the awesome superhero he is then that person should also attempt to reflect a bit of Superman in himself. Along this same lines while I have no issue with the use of profane words I do not think you need to resort to profane ideas. Sometimes when talking about Superman a holy shit! Or a what the fuck? Is entirely appropriate but I dont think talking about how Superman would fuck Lois so hard that she would walk funny is needed and might not be useful when attempting to show the greatness of Superman. To finish up though I did like the podcast and I love the concept of helping the rest of us find ways to show the world how super Superman truly is. Please dont hate me for what I said I just wanted to share my insight and I wont be offended if you take my criticisms and toss them out the window. I will listen to the podcast and I look forward to the next episode. Thanks again for your time and effort and keep it up! Edit spelling and such,superman,d4ss3n9,4,t5_2qrwe

9599347,0,t3_5cbwju,So I feel ready to weigh in. The realistic and difficult reality presented in MoS and nailed in BvS are exactly why I love these films and was disappointed in Suicide Squad. Im just back from the excellent Doctor Strange but I feel Disney is not trying to make any comment on the world. The films in the MCU are purely escapism and dont seek to make any comment at all on the world. For example The Ancient One being a Caucasian rather than a Tibetan is a move designed to appeal to the majority. BvS specifically sought to present a modern world that these heroes we know so well would struggle and fail within. I love that. If Batman and Superman existed they would be absolutely targeted by world governments. Batman would most likely be in jail and Superman being dissected in Area . BvS succeeds in trying to show a realistic view of how difficult it is to do the right thing and I love it. Regarding Trump and Brexit I dont think any comic book films are actually commenting on these movements yet but I am looking forward to seeing what audiences and critics get behind in the future. I think Logan will most likely do very well if it is as nihilistic as I think its going to be. JL and Infinity War I think will do storming business both. In terms of the article I think its a bit mushy and I wouldnt draw any relationship to current events and either film. ,superman,d9wbdll,3,t5_2qrwe

10149231,0,t1_dbuf5zt,Its been said in this thread that the comics timeline has been changed so much you cant use the older stuff as reference points anymore. But speaking of comics Snyder did say that The Dark Knight Returns was one of his big inspirations for this Batman. Even in there Joker gives Batman plenty of precedent to kill him and Batman STILL wont do it. The Joker kills himself to make it look like Batman did it. This is just an area of the character that Snyder doesnt understand or outright ignores like Tim Burton because he wants his Batman to be his own thing. Which I also said elsewhere in this thread that I get Batmans motivations for why and it works but you cant deny this Batman has made a choice to be a killer. I see where people are upset about it just like I saw how they were upset about Superman killing Zod in MOS but for me personally that worked for that story. I think we just have to accept that these are not canon versions of these characters. This sounds like Im being argumentative but Im really enjoying this discussion btw. ,superman,dbug403,4,t5_2qrwe
