727774,0,t3_22hi39,Well as the others already said its a bit a silly question as rarely anything ever will happen. On public transit I would take care of your belongings a bit. Its not unheard of people stealing jackets or bags in trains.However Langstrasse or its relative proximity to Bahnhofplatz have nothing to do with it. Id be more worried living in the outskirts of the city rather than the center.,zurich,cgn02dl,2,t5_2s7k8

1809607,0,t3_2f9uek,As an exchange student you dont need a gym membership as the ASVZ is always included in your tuition fees. Its . per semester for students and there is no way to optout.Only exception Visiting researchers that are not exchange students. These are handled like visitors to ETH and are not officially students as they mostly come for  months in the summer. But if you are taking courseslectures or have exams you are definitely an exchange student. You will get a student number LegiNr. and a student card Legi which has the ASVZ logo on it in the front.The ASVZ website is not fully translated. Youll need to use the German site until they manage to fix their links. Membership English  Sports centers  WeightsCardioMachines called Kraftraum in German literally means strength room. This is what you are looking for  List of ongoing sessions for groups The Kraftraum is unsupervised you can just do whatever you want on the machines. However you can also sign up for h oneonone sessions with instructors where you can ask them specific questions and get tips. Usually you sign up on a sheet in front of the room and its free.There are lots of group sessions some unsupervised freies Trainingfree training where you can just e.g. play basketball and some supervised ones where youll do something in a group with an instructor. For some of the courses you need to sign up at the beginning of the semester or even before the semester in some cases and for exotic stuff scuba divingsailingetc. you need to be really early the day of the signup and also possibly pay some additional fees.The instructors are quite competent and professional they are full time employees not volunteers.,zurich,ck78cwk,10,t5_2s7k8

2678951,0,t3_2p96yr,A little late to the party...You could try the ASVZ which is mostly for students. But you could try to get in. The price is really cheap for what you get gym multiple classes karate wunshu judo dance classes sailing ... all for free multiple training places good trainers e.g. we have the highest JKA trainer in switzerland Sugimura Sensei as our trainerIf you are not into this I highly recommend the asia sport center use google translate if you cannot read German. The master is nuts. They did I dont know if the still do it a presentation at a festival for a few years I was very impressed. They also offer multiple courses so you could try out a few before deciding what you want to do.If you want to do more traditional karate I highly recommend the karate club Richterswil The master will drive you insane but he is the best.If you want more information I could tell you more about the classes at the ASVZ I train and teach there myself and about the classes at Richterswil where I occasionally train.,zurich,cn89cwf,1,t5_2s7k8

8952505,0,t1_d7nx02s,Yeah based on my experience its only equally badworse in Finland and Japan PIt doesnt have anything to do with you but that probably doesnt help much. You still can make friend but it just takes a long time. And I have the impression you have to put in a lot of effort to compensate for the Chindsgi factor or the lack thereof.Since you are younger than the average expat it probably isnt your crowd either. But I suggest to try various eventsmeetings and see if you like any of them or the people attending.,zurich,d7nyhhv,1,t5_2s7k8

We bought a Jack Wolfskin outdoor jacket at Ochsner Sport for CHF  instead of  a Jack Wolfskin fleece jacket at the Jack Wolfskin store for CHF  instead of  a winter coat at s.Oliver for CHF  instead of  some kitchen utensils at Kuhn Rikon for CHF  each instead of We left around pm and even then it wasnt realy crowded probably because of the sunny weather.
