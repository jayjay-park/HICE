2314819,0,t1_clxtd4j,My problem is that I know for sure when I finish high school and try to get a job I will go out on the field and be like what am I even doing here? We are just learning bunch of theoretical stuff. I dont know what that fiberglass tapes are since I have never worked with them nor saw them. Had to google robotic total station to see what it does. Professors were only mentioning GPS system. We are supposed to work in AutoCAD and even have a class for that twice a week but we are just drawing D objects like mechanic schemes. So much for schooling in Serbia when we have to pass the exam at end of th year draw some maps and plans and we dont even have instruments to do it. Its new type of exam here where we take exam from all surveying related classes. Before it was just maths and native language exam.,landsurveying,clxtrsv,2,t5_2skf2
