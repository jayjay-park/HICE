768533,0,t3_22y497,Im going through the freebsd handbook teaching myself now. Im learning specifically to better utilize things like pfsense and freenas. Ive been a Windows Sysadmin for quite a long time and its very hard to change my way of thinking about the OS. freebsd documentation is really good too even for a dummy like me. I wish it went into more details for someone used to windows though.,BSD,cgrmxy9,3,t5_2qh3d

877220,0,t1_ch3xppd,Exactly its a matter of philosophy and ideology and I believe that competition and intellectual property are actually holding back mankinds progress.  Not that these things can be eradicated overnight but when it comes to software I believe we can pave the way for a brighter future by using the GPL v. Not that the BSD license is in any way bad I just think it enables certain entities to perpetuate the competition and hold back universal innovation. In a perfect world we all collaborate and work together to conquer mankinds problems and ensure our own survival.You should check out After the Software Wars Anyway Im not sure my comments are appreciated in this sub as they seem to be perceived as antiBSD which I can assure you they are not and thus consistently downvoted. ,BSD,ch3zs3w,1,t5_2qh3d

1374735,0,t1_ciogsj9,No I already said in my question that I will not consider PCBSD.You started this thread asking for input but it seems like you are not very flexible in at least listening to  quality feedback. You have also made some assumptions. PCBSD does not require you to have GB free. It is recommended but you can install it on a lot less. It does have an excellent GUI installer which gives you a choice of various desktop environments and the option of ZFS root right out of the box.It doesnt help that one of my favorite sites on all things linux Dedoimedo.com gave it a scathing review. Welcome to the open source community. You will find various opinions of different platforms all over the Internet. If you base your opinion on the review of one site that is your sacred right but I think your are presenting a somewhat closedminded approach. There is a reason you find a number of people on a BSD forum recommend PCBSD.Once you dig around more in the community you will also find that Distrowatch rankings are not authoritarian declarations of quality or suitability for specific purposes.Your focus on graphical and text installers is a bit misplaced in a sense that if you are willing to get into BSD you obviously have an interest in being more technical than just buying a laptop with a major preinstalled OS on it. With that in mind any of the four major BSDs FreeBSD OpenBSD NetBSD DragonFly BSD are fairly easy to install through text mode.If you want FreeBSD with GUI you can also try  .I suggest more reading up and research you should not be so easily influenced by just a few limited sources rankings one of your favorite sites of information on BSD.,BSD,ciolz3d,8,t5_2qh3d

1715988,0,t3_2e1oz7,I think this is a great thing. Free software is powered by the efforts of talented volunteers the more people we can attract to work on BSD the better.The fact is that for decades now computer science and IT have been strongly skewed towards males. Theres no biological reason for this women can be and are excellent programmers the problem is cultural. CSIT and especially FOSS are rightly or wrongly perceived as a giant boys club. If we want the most talented people working for the projects we care about we have to attract everyone. The fact that  of the population is so underrepresented in our field is a disgrace. And who could blame women for feeling unwanted given sentiments like those expressed in this thread. Its  for christs sake!Its just flights to a conference its not like were letting unproven people onto the FreeBSD security team.

OpenBSD by contrast worked nearly flawlessly with the only weird bit being that plugging headphones into the headphone jack didnt stop audio from coming from the main system speakers as well. This was all about  or  years ago though things are probably different now.It might seem all the crypto stuff OpenBSD does would make it slower but IIRC last time I tried OpenBSD on a G it was faster than stock OSX.,BSD,cn13gk7,12,t5_2qh3d
