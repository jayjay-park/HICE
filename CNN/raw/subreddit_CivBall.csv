2696281,0,t1_cnah24v, Slide  The orange red amp white ball is New Danzilona. At the time New Danzilona was using the old Danzilonan flag of which I believe there were two of  a purple tricolour and a red tricolour but I couldnt remember the purple one too well. Slide  The DPNCCR forms when old members of Danzilona split away. Slide  Angry Africa another faction to settle in the area claims a section of land which is now part of the city. Slide  Angry Africa falls inactive. New Danzilonas farms grow to a relatively huge size. The DPNCCR didnt reinforce its buildings so was massively griefed and retreats to become a hidden underground settlement. Slide  Lowtuffs flag design called the Albratros Cross at that time is approved of and put into use. New Danzillona and Holy Tree form a very strong friendship.,CivBall,cnaiu24,2,t5_2xe9i
