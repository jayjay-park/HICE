115046,0,t1_ceri3qy,I had trouble on the final boss because I spent most of my renown on the supplies on the Skogr path. It was only when I got to Boersgard that I was able to level people up XD,bannersaga,cerj4jj,1,t5_2trzq
122540,0,t3_1veju6,Nid CAN die. I apologize that I cant confirm exactly where but there will be a situation where she is firing at some dredge following your caravan and if you decide to assault the dredge and lose that battle she will have died in the conflict.,bannersaga,cesdvix,1,t5_2trzq
124823,0,t3_1vht60,Part of the problem is that many of the dredge are terrible units.When playing multiplayer factions one more or less needs to ensure that all your units can do something useful when on low strength.Eg high break or a special ability that does something good without being strength dependant.A unit that does not have one of those two things becomes a liability when on low strength.,bannersaga,cesn9ej,4,t5_2trzq

314180,0,t3_1xnehk,This is definitely a game I would have enjoyed three or so more hours of difficult somewhat filler combat the same type of random events supplies found one or two new members various dredger encounters without getting bored. I enjoyed the combat enough that I would have loved some more fluff.,bannersaga,cfdc13g,2,t5_2trzq

7094687,0,t1_d1drmgk,I loved using Alette as a pure armor breaker. Drop their armor from afar and then let the heavy hitters do their work. I used Alette and Rook in every fight!,bannersaga,d1kjw4q,1,t5_2trzq
7277328,0,t1_d25cvyg,Aaahh I see. Like multiple people controlling different characters from a single save file? How does that work?And you mentioned major roleplaying sites. Would you mind directing me to a few of these mentioned sites?,bannersaga,d25dtid,2,t5_2trzq
7320475,0,t1_d2aa2kc,The good thing is you can ultimately do both  they seem to have pretty different dialogue and you can focus on using different characters in the second go round. ,bannersaga,d2aad3i,2,t5_2trzq
7338269,0,t3_4fvc9w,I beat it on normal. I dont really remember what I did in particular. Perhaps my heroes are higher rank than yours because I imported my BS saved game?,bannersaga,d2cb797,5,t5_2trzq

7392150,0,t1_d2g92yv,I was very surprised when I saw that was supposed to be the governor of Boersgard. From what I read of him in the first game I was expecting the typical fat ineffectual cowardly politician type who would at best be an annoying minor character. Instead we got a more sophisticated version of Onef.Id have preferred if they had explored the conflict between him and Rook more over the game by having him play a role and debate with Rook in caravan decisions cutscenes etc. I think it would have fleshed him out more as opposed to just having him insult Rook for most of the game and then predictably backstab him in the end.,bannersaga,d2ifrl6,2,t5_2trzq
7409956,0,t3_4gqp6f,I also used the guide uoskli posted ive found it pretty useful in BS. So I noted the markets and travel days in my first BS playthrough down. But honestly i didnt find it so useful like in the first game because of the clansman supply gathering and the mass of  supply events.  ampnbsp    Chapter  Forth from their homes  Start  Food  Renown to Ormsdalr   Days  ampnbsp    Chapter  Cast the hone into the air  Ormsdalr to Village    Days  Village to Bindal   Days  ampnbsp    Chapter  To speak in all tongues  Eastway Road to Grundar    Days  Grundar to Lundar   Days  ampnbsp    Chapter  Where a foe may lurk  Bindal  to Secret Cave   Day  Secret Cave to Secret Cave end   Days  ampnbsp    Chapter  The destined day shall come  Lundar to Etingbekkr    Days  Etingbekkr to Village    Days  Village to Fiskivik   Days  ampnbsp    Chapter  The getters will burst  Woodcutter Village  to small Village    Days  small Village to Old Ford    Days  ampnbsp    Chapter  Brothers fight and kinship stain  Village near Tolir  to Arberrang    Days  ampnbsp    Chapter  In fear quake all  ampnbsp    Enjoy  but be careful the days may vary because of events and paths taken.

7489533,0,t1_d2prjx9,Yeah for my BS import I had Hakon Alette IverYngvar and Egil all maxed out which greatly boosted my BS playthrough since I used them a lot for my style of Overwatch w Alette amp Oddleifs ambushes. Especially since that core group stays together. I think the Master Tactician event is easiest to earn when playing with the original heroes. The team that goes off with Bolverk is a bit... well hard pressed to safely fight all of the battles. Especially once you find the corrupted Dredgelikes in the tunnels that fight is a pain in the ass for me.,bannersaga,d2tipql,1,t5_2trzq
7512824,0,t1_d2tiih0,Honestly I think its more of age thing than a gender thing dont get me wrong gender is clearly a part of it but I think Rugga would act in a similiar way to Egil if he were leader.,bannersaga,d2w65me,2,t5_2trzq

8834419,0,t1_d77rmmp,RoEch is amazing stun on an enemy that also breaks armour up to  and does chip damage to anyone the enemy passes through and also he can move after taking an action.Honestly all the characters are pretty well fleshed out statability wise.  I was really bad at the game at first but as I got better I began to see how each character could be used.,bannersaga,d79ru4n,1,t5_2trzq
9848833,0,t3_5f4iap,You can comment out the whole news line in tbsconfig.ini by prefixing it with a hash mark This should disable it entirely.As was pointed out these are not external ads or anything like that only a place to make announcements and promotions about Banner Saga related stuff.  We have no interest in displaying external ads in our games. So for instance in the future if we are going to be at PAX or something handing out free shirts then we will put an announcement there.,bannersaga,darbqka,4,t5_2trzq

10218228,0,t3_5m8xk5,Honestly dont think it works for the tone of the game The Banner Saga is partially about making tough decisions and being limited So if they did give you the choice to go different places it would rather be akin to at one point choosing which route to taketown to try for with each one having its consequences but would converge back to another bath like in some JRPGs or Visual Novels a game where you can go anywhere willy nilly which is what a true open world game is would break the spirit of the games.,bannersaga,dc2al52,5,t5_2trzq
