60901,0,t3_1ussoc,I dont know where you got the notion that TWoo has credibility for speccing but its a wrong one. What TWoo does have credibility for is being a brewer and a sometimes reasonably successful one at that. As such coupled with his public image stream and considerable wealth of fans players seem very quick to adopttry out his decks even moreso when the deck is cheap. Twoos following is quick to snap up cards for playing typically featured in his brews especially his more successful ones e.g. the recent Ninja Bear Delver especially when a brew is given some amount credibility by another name in magic like LSV on the Ninja Bear deck. What this means for you as a speculator and this goes for many top players is that you can watch what they playsayetc and speculate based on the success of the deck. For instance the second LSV put up the video playing NBD and said This deck is awesome I went straight to TCGPlayer and bought  playsets of Disrupting Shoal at  each as Im sure many other speculators did as well as players looking to get their personal set.TLDR TWoo is a brewer with a somewhat justifiably rabid following and when his decks are decentgood the market usually follows.EDIT Also re manipulation TWoo is seemingly indifferent towards the market i.e. he doesnt have vested interest in the prices of cards hes playingadvocating whether they go up or down etc.,mtgfinance,celd410,8,t5_2vv1m

Also the RL existed first and foremost for stores not collectors or any of that other stuff. A LOT of stores in the US went out of business thanks to Chronicles.Also this all assumes WOTC has a good economics team. They almost certainly do not. They may miss that without doubling the player base MM would have been PLENTY of reprint for current demand.

Sure you basically win the game after you get it but really you dont. If I show and tell an emrakul in play its going to be very hard for you to deal with. Im on blue so I probably have counter magic and emrakul is just a total bastard to try to kill. Heck you can show and tell omnicience and win on the spot.With squirrels you have to wait a turn so you can attack them with your  army and you also have to hope they dont have some fancy thing like golgari charm or zealous persecution that will shut you down for another turn or . Those cards have been on the rise anyways because of TNN.So in short its a  card combo that basically wins but so is show and tell and show and tell does it better and also happens to be blue.I feel like earthcraft is fine it would add a new deck to the meta make enchantress better and inject some more diversity into legacy.

842168,0,t1_cgzzhay,Your argument would carry more weight if Onslaught also had a land matters theme.  It did not however so I dont think the lands in a set must necessarily tie in with the blocks mechanics.  It is nice sure but look at Innistrad Scars of Mirrodin or Return to Ravnica for recent examples of land cycles which did not tie in mechanically to the setsblocks they were featured in.  Just about the only thing that these lands had to do with any of these planes is their names and weve already covered how the fetchland names are ambiguous enough to be featured on just about any plane.Taking up  rare slots over a block is irrelevant every block from now on will have  rare slots for dual land cycles.  It would be a lot easier than you seem to imply to insert fetches into the mix here.  Whether they do or not I cannot say but the possibility exists and is a very simple task assuming the ones they replace are not mechanically reliant on the block they were originally designed for.  I mean this seriously  these lands could go in the day before the set starts getting printed changes have been made almost this close to printing before see Tarmogoyf.As for this gt Having people at the prerelease ask What does this awkward land do in my rare slot its terrible because it doesnt even produce mana and I have to sacrifice to use it?! is just wrong.How does this change from the current format in any way shape or form? There are already going to be  rare dual lands in Huey and new players are still going to ask this question time after time.  The entire reason that fetches have been ruled out from Core sets is for this reason new players dont understand the fetchlands they dont understand why you would want to pay life and sacrifice the land.  There is a reason that anything more complex than the m lands have appeared in blocks they are advanced sets.  ,mtgfinance,ch009qk,2,t5_2vv1m

Print labels. Pack cards. Haul  shipments to the post box etc.  It would probably take an entire afternoon just to photograph  upload  list everything.But in the end I think if Im going to get what I want out of selling my collection that I will have to piece it out.

We lose Shocks and Guildgates at Khans and as of now we only know about enemy Painlands to fill that void. Scrylands will let you shape your draws and the Painlands will keep mana smooth. Theyll go up even more if we see Fetches in Khans unlikely but we can hope as they open up the ability to peek before shuffling anything away. If there is no land cycle in Khans allied Scrylands will be in high demand. Also as we approach rotation any staples in Theros block will start to creep up out of anticipation both from players and dealers. When your rotating cards start to bottom out it only makes sense to compensate by raising prices on what stays.BNGJOU Scrylands are in shorter supply as well something to consider.

We dont get to see the power of certain cards and it may stay under the radar for longer. For example had this block structure started in RTR Pack Rat would have never seen play being out by the time Gary was in standard. It may have never gotten the shine it did and its burgeoning inclusion in modern Jund decks would be delayed if not nonexistent. One could argue that this could lead to further total experimentation in modern and I would not be upset with this but it can also be argued that it will take changes in the nonrotating metagames longer to cement themselves.I disagree with your claim that this is overall a negative.

2647088,0,t3_2q93uu,So I started playing Magic the year I was on international exchange as a  yearold kid. In Nebraska. It was an accident I swear! I watched the new YuGiOh! show and went to the local store to buy th cards when they came out. Surprise sold out. The shopowner laughed and told me to play a real game and sold me a th edition starter kit. Goddamnit. Well I enjoyed the game an when I went back to Europe Id already started trading online. I very quickly realized how much money I could make. Now let me lay out the situation for youEveryone in the US traded at either magazine SCRY prices or MOTL. I quickly began trading exclusivel on MOTL. Ebay prices market value lots of tradeauctions for better cards duals P etc.Danes on the other hand were idiots. Everyone traded on one forum and sold on another. Selling was around  of shop value. Shop value was a local shop. And they made up their own prices. Some cards were expensive because they never bothered lowering prices. Think Blaze of Glory Forcefield etc. And standard rares cost a fortune. IE two fetch lands EASILY traded for a underground sea.As an  yearold entrepreneur I abused this massively. Traded cards for a few duals. Shipped the duals via MOTL and got ten times the rares two weeks later. Lather rinse repeat. It took me less than three years to have a fully powered deck all  duals all moxen and walk beta mind you. I aint no scrub!. I kept on going I played as much because it got mwe closer to people to ensure trades as anything else.God I miss those days.I also built up large stacks of crap rares from trades for bulk etc. I ended up selling collections with good descriptions on a national Ebay like site. But my last stack I never got rid of despite offering a stick of k rares for around  cent a pop before quitting when Ravnica came out. Fast forward to around lateAlara and I sat needing money. Pulled out my old decks looked up prices after an hour realizing how high my cards had gotten I also came to the conclusion that no not selling. But it was monday MTG night at the local store so I went there to see if people still played. Brought the stick. Imagine my surprise when I realize those useless Grindstones all  of them  were worth a fortune. As were the ten Kiras and fifteen Tops. In the end thanks to EDH I got nearly k for that entire stick. Talk about value gain!These days noone trades much. I use MCM as a virtual way oft radin stuff I dont need into money and money into cards I need. And then I invest whatevers lying around when I see a good deal. Jace last rotation bought me the Moat I always wanted and the fully foiled modern Merfolk deck I play now which has around tripled in value since. Yay!.In the end I also find it interesting how the cards I like are the ones that have gained the msot value. Last count after getting rid of vintage stuff and cutting down on Legacy I still realized that considering sales over th years I currently have maybe k invested in the game over the last  years cheap hobby! and have cards worth close to the k mark atm. Most are simply valuedriven these days by collectability ie my foreign BB duals ABU duals rare pimp stuff like judgefoil bolts and also my stupid Legend collection. EDH took that bunch of crap and assigned it all playability and value. The Tabernacle of course helps too p Speaking of I still remember Tabernacle being worth the same as a Savannah. Goddamnit WHY did I trade that way and not the other? Ive had at least  a dozen of those bastards through my hands!,mtgfinance,cn43u3o,1,t5_2vv1m

2818821,0,t1_cnnmoqt,If TC gets banned I think decks will need better card advantage spells but also people will still want to play their cards like Lightning Bolt and Snapcaster Mage. If they do the obvious answer is control it has a lot of the burn and draw aspects of the UR Delver deck that wont be so powerful in that deck anymore if TC gets banned. People will keep their scalding tarns burn and delver spells and add things like Dig Through Time and some white for Ajani Lightning Helix and Resto Angel and start playing UWR control to utilize those UR delver cards in a better deck  assuming TC gets banned. Obviously Pod is still a thing too so I would get Temple Garden and overgrown tomb if you think pod is going to catch on.

3422263,0,t1_cpibplg,Not just that.  NPR did a  minute piece last week called The Curse of the Black Lotus.  It basically details how in the mids WotC realized that Magic was in a classic finance bubble.  Just about everything theyve done since including the creation of Standard and the Reserve List was designed to deflate that bubble rather than letting it pop.  Instead of a game that exploded and deflated in  years theyve managed itand made a mountain of moneyfor  years.  WotCs number one priority is keeping as many formats of the game healthy as possible because it is very rare for players to single out one specific format and ignore all others they know that maintaining at least one format that you like increases the odds that you will either buy product or participate in tournaments that they make money off.To whit pissing off enfranchised players is the last thing that WotC wants.

3610053,0,t1_cq3oqr6,People seem frustrated with the lack of content but the measure of content always seems to be different than what the goal of this subreddit is. We see content as something of value to a reader. But the frustrated people often just cite that there were more posts before. There were. We knew that it would slow the sub down. It wasnt a goal to get as many subscribers as we could or to get a record number of posts. Just to be a place with good content. At the beginning of  we had an influx of users due to the spike posts. It was often information that was too late to do anything with but the users seemed to like seeing changes in price and didnt seem to care much that most of that was just people losing money. So the owner brought me and another mod on. I started March th . To compare magic players using reddit Ill include rmagicTCG in there too. |Subreddit|Users |Current users| Growth|||||||MagicTCG|||||MTGFinance|||||Spikes||||In that time I think our  growth is good compared to the growth in magic players that are using reddit. It isnt as good as Spikes but it isnt a contest. If the goal was to get the largest sub Id just start one for cat pictures. So this conversation boils down to a few things.

I agree with the supply and demand but plenty of cards prices are driven up and then retain an absurd cost.

Look what all these online guys did at GP Vegas. They bought EVERYTHING and now sit on them. They are trying to corner the market or keep prices high. It sounds a little tinfoil hat like but I have personally seen this in action. And Wotc is happy to oblige them. SCG CFB etc. are getting to much of the secondary market pie. With more and more stores online sites and personal speculators jumping in it is getting really crowded and causing these huge price swings. This happens before a crash. Something has to give.

But I cant pretend I have any interest in writing that type of article or ever will.As for style thats just the way I write nonfiction prose allaround. In fact Im surprised by this feedback because I find  of the mtgfinance writing to be too dry and boring  and  of it to be too selfserious. Thats partly what my style here is reacting against especially as seen in my sense of the sheer absurdity of the phrase MTG Finance in context of most participants actual experience.Im always eager for a temperature check of an audience as to how things are coming across. That said if you dont enjoy a storytellingbased personalitybased read I just may never be the writer for you. If you click back to my intro piece from two weeks ago I lay out up front that Im far from the biggest econ expert or the most experienced dealer  my strength is in the ability to find and shape a narrative which is both how I impart information and an approach to bargaining that I intend to focus on.

6263654,0,t3_41cqy4,I have not done this personally so my advice is almost entirely anecdotal. Just to be upfront.One of my friends loves foreign cards and what he has done is used Facebook and forum sites like mtgsalvation or pucatrade or whatever and established people he trusts in other countries to do longdistance trades every so often sometimes even for sealed product. He doesnt have to pay markup as many of the players in other countries prefer to have English cards anyways or are happy to value different languages the same. For example I know for sure that he traded  foil English JTMS for  foil Japanese ones back when they were standard legal through a Japanese friend he made online so if you put the work into it its doable.My advice would be to ask yourself if this work is worth it. Do you want to get some foreign cards in one fell swoop and be done or do you want to slowly build your foreign collection and add to it as new setscards are released? Do you want singles or playsets? etc.As far as French cards go many foreign languages are really hard to find simply because there is no demand for them. With languages like French Spanish or Italian theres no real premium for them so people dont really care in fact Id say a lot of European players prefer English language cards anyways due to the ubiquity of the language. Perhaps an easier alternative would be to find a French LGS Facebook? Google search? and send them an email or a phone call depending on where in the world you are located it might be waaaaay too expensive to call though! explain your situation and ask if they would be willing to work something out with you. Id imagine many small LGS owners would be happy to find a solution that works for you!Good luck on your hunt!,mtgfinance,cz1lvu9,1,t5_2vv1m

The more pragmatic questions are how likely is this? when can we expect this to be a problem? and are there any other solutions?For the first question Im pretty sure this will happen eventually.For the second question who knows? It might not happen for ten years. It might have already happened and we just dont know it yet I know its pretty damn unlikely.For the third question there might be some options worth considering.

What youre not realizing is this is the same exact thing.  Youre giving youre opponent a choice of the lesser of two evils.  How is that ever a remotely good effect?Youre still focusing on the random chance.  That is irrelevant in this card and any discussion on magic.   It is completely out of anyones control and the probabilities are the same no matter if you draw this way or not.  The complete point is that you will never get what you want from this card.  Every turn youre asking your opponent which is more advantageous for them.  Taking a small amount of or no damage or you keeping the card you drew.,mtgfinance,d19u9j4,-4,t5_2vv1m

7122928,0,t1_d1mvjec,The deal is inflation. Theyve been steadily adding pucapoints to the global pool since the deal started and they figure that as long as the pucapoint addition rate is slower than the rate that people bring cards into the pool everything is fine which is sound enough.Inflation doesnt even hurt anyone as long as the relative card prices are correct e.g. one Gilded Drake is approximately two RTR Hallowed Fountains and you dont carry the point balance for long. Trading a Gilded Drake for X jellybeans and then immediately trading those jellybeans to someone for two RTR Hallowed Fountains isnt a bad deal no matter how many jellybeans the transaction involved. The key is to not hold the volatile currency.Its just that the moment that the pucapoint addition rate exceeds the card value addition rate people will stop sending cards in exchange for pucapoints and the people with  pucapoints in reserve are going to be left holding a large bag of air. Youll be holding those jellybeans for longer and longer before someone has faith enough in them to give you your two Hallowed Fountains for them and theyll probably demand more than you got from the Gilded Drake.My advice to you is the same as my advice to a friend who owns a local game store a year and a half ago Its useful as long as its useful. Use it for as long as it continues to work for you but dont have faith in it. Dont carry a large balance.Full disclosure Ive traded  total value on Pucatrade. My current balance is  points.,mtgfinance,d1nskml,2,t5_2vv1m

Its much cheaper to take an old standard deck you already have and start adding modern stuff to it even if its just a few cards at a time.

7763501,0,t1_d3on5ip,I think weve always seen it in Jund as little more than a valueadd. Few people are really doubling down on Cascade being a huge payoff. The reality of Modern and Legacy is that most of your stuff is cheap anyway so youre going to tend to hit a lot more anyway. That said its important to remember that Cascade is a deck building restriction. There are all sorts of things you cant really run because its in your deck counters being a huge one you have to cut. So its not  upside by any means. Its one of the reasons that Shardless BUG in Legacy can be a very swingy deck because it cant run cards like Daze and cascading into Hymn or Thoughtseize can be absolutely dead at certain points in the game.

CoCo is closer to Narset Transcendent than it is to Treasure Cruise and nobody is talking about how broken Narset is in any format.Read the text of the card not what you think it does.  Treasure Cruise always draws  cards.  Sometimes you can pay  to do so but it always has the same effect.  The quality of those cards may vary but you always get .CoCo SOMETIMES puts  creatures into play sometimes it doesnt.  You always pay the same amount but there is no guarantee as to what the spell does.

To my knowledge the deck wants to play a few planeswalkers that can protect themselves cascade into a Restore Balance that destroys all of the opponents lands and win the game. It does this by playing Borderposts as a mana source so that you will have very few lands when you cascade effectively destroying all of the opponents lands and creatures allowing you to tick up planeswalkers until they die. I think it used to play Greater Gargadon as a win con but dropped it because it was so inconsistent.Why is it good? I dunno. I guess it must be good good against some of the top decks in the format.

Currently a lot of the demand for khans fetches comes from the fact that they are cheaper.   A burn player does not care what fetches they use as long as they fetch mountain so they go for the cheapest one available.  The same is true for many many decks.  If enemy fetches get reprinted then they will become the cheap option and therefore much of the demand will switch from khans fetches to enemy fetches.

8776569,0,t3_50bq0e,So this question is loaded due to the way prerelease promos have changed over the years.Old school prereleases everybody got the same card.  There was only  prerelease card for the entire set.As a result there were lots of copies of said card available since everybody got one for each prerelease they attended admittedly usually only  back in the day as well.People didnt like getting this card they couldnt play with at prerelease so Wizards shook it up by having several different prerelease cards and now you could pick which colorclan you wanted to be.  More variation meant less of any  specific card being available.Still worth less but not as much less.  Problem was if  prerelease card was strictly better competitively than others those ones were always picked first and players got the feel bads for not being able to play their favorite color or knowing they would have a disadvantage against the field.So they changed it again to make it so there were several different for each clan KtK block.  This is when prerelease rares really started to be rare in comparison to the pack foils.  There were still a guaranteed number put into circulation but the supply was spread out over  different cards rather than  for each color or just the same card for every player.Again though even as a set you were likely to have  clan strictly better or at least perceived that way so now its any rare goes.SOOld prerelease rares tend to be significantly cheaper than their counterparts due to large supply relevant to playerbase.Relatively newer set prerelease rares are affected by the same thing but not as much.Recent sets there is much less discrepancy.Latest sets the prerelease rare is quite possibly more rare than the pack foils by the time a set is finished being in print.There is a couple additional factors like price memory people are used to the prerelease ones being cheaper due to the old way of things and preference lots of people dont like having the date on the card or the FNM symbol or whatever and only want pack foil.Personally I think were in a transition period where people dont realize the rarity of the prerelease sets vs the pack foils and that due to these other factors they are cheaper but long term I think prerelease foils from the newest sets where any rare goes will be more expensive than pack foils.TLDRIt depends on the age the prerelease foil is from due to changing the way prerelease foils were done.,mtgfinance,d72qm9w,10,t5_2vv1m

9032750,0,t1_d7xjbrd,I think youre looking at it like youve been operating as a business over all those past years which isnt really the case.  You cant really just write off all magic purchases made over the past five years as an expense like your example of paying  and getting  value  thats really irrelevant to the cards you are selling.   That could potentially be a deductible business expense in the year it occurred if you had been operating as a vendor over these past five years.  But to figure the price on certain cards you just have to use some logical way  Like if you paid  for a collection of  cards got one card of value.  I would put its cost at  or . which isnt really good you would want its costbasis to be higher.   Or if you traded for a card you could compute its cost as the  value of cards you had to give up to get it. But the more I think about it it sounds like something I would treat as a hobby.  Okay youve sunk all this money into Magic cards and eventually got some money back likely less than your total outlay.  Id report the  and put your total expenses at  so it nets out to .  Youll pay no taxes but you wont receive any benefit either.  If you were to put  and then  of expenses that  loss would be advantageous to you and offset your earnings from your normal day job  but the rule is you arent allowed to use hobby losses to offset normal income.,mtgfinance,d7xldko,1,t5_2vv1m

9120349,0,t3_5567ip,I was thinking about this too but the answer is probably  not at all at least longterm. The reason being is that if the EV of sealed product is too high it will create arbitrage allowing dealers to be able to make more money opening sealed product and selling singles than selling the sealed product outright. This is essentially what happens now up until the first couple weeks after a sets release at which point the market is flooded with enough singles to cause demand to drop and the EV of sealed product to equal out or exceed that of the singles on it.  Limiting redemption might mean more paper product is opened or it takes a little longer to get below the arbitrage point but I would be surprised if it had any significant impact.,mtgfinance,d8848l3,3,t5_2vv1m

Unless you are an employer you dont pay payroll taxes. Secondly as far as schools and roads schools are funded by county property tax so if you dont own any property you already enjoy this benefit for free. This is not tied to federal income tax and Trump has no effect on it.Roads are funded by gas taxes and excise taxes. You determine how much of this you pay by your gas consumption. The Federal government is responsible for the upkeep of the Interstate system but outside of that Trump would have no effect on roads. He has pleged to rebuild our infrastructure a promise Obama made as well but did not follow through with. I guess we will see if Trumps plan comes to fruition now that he will be President.On the topic of income inequality we come to our first ideological divide so lets explore that. What is income inequality? How much of a gap do you believe there should be between a Doctor and a Janitor? Between a Bank Executive and a Fast Food Worker? And if you believe that wage gaps such as those need to be bridged do you believe the Federal government is the party responsible for making that happen and what mechanism should they employ to bring about that change?I await your response thank you for your opinions.,mtgfinance,d9uvlxe,0,t5_2vv1m

9977784,0,t1_db77fdg,Someone posted about this topic a while ago. From what was said there the way the searched pack scam less of a true scam more of a way to get people to waste money gets you is they send good packs first to people who want to test the waters and buy just a few. Then when most of those people inevitably buy a bunch more because its ostensibly a great deal and theyve confirmed it for themselves that is when the seller sends you the searched ones. Not saying this is necessarily the case but its something to think about if you buy a few and theyre good packs.,mtgfinance,db84t1d,3,t5_2vv1m
9990214,0,t1_db7q3yh,As an aside  what are your actual shipping costs?I used to sell singles on Ebay and charged shipping roughly in line with my actual costs.At the time those were . AUD for a bubble mailer . AUD for postage . AUD for a top loader . AUD for a penny sleeve plus . AUD for the flat part of PayPals fees for a cost of AUD .. I charged AUD  for postage on one item  card or playset and AUD . for each extra item.The discounted postage on subsequent items often drove people to buy multiple items at once.At present postage fees Id have to increase these costs  mailing a bubble mailer is now AUD . in postage fees.Do you have lower costs or do you just factor postage costs into your prices and suck it up when people buy only one card?,mtgfinance,db9r3lp,1,t5_2vv1m

One thought is that they follow the same price as scry lands low initial price because shock lands were so widely used until rotation and then a strong climb after they became the only mana base in standard. Usually the standard hype will cause a higher price tag but there isnt much room for them to fall.
