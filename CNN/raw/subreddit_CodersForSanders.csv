4775953,0,t1_ctwc7zs,After you click add this to Facebook photos and it completes it asks if you want to make this photo you profile picture now.  If you say ok it takes you to the appropriate Facebook page to accomplish this easily.  I couldnt find a more direct way to accomplish this given facebooks api limitations.  I need to work on design and copy for this feature.,CodersForSanders,ctwjuur,3,t5_38p5e

5041189,0,t1_cutn2k6,How many privateunadvertised projects are there? Ive really wanted to get involved but looking through the github and website I see references to projects that dont exist or have no publicly visible documentation. Seems detrimental to the overall goal of getting people involved to have invisible projects. The only projects that have mentions anywhere are websites but Im a backend guy. There isnt a mention of many projects on the Current Projects listings I was able to find including the project were discussing   What are those of us who want to get involved have filled out the proper forms and havent been contacted and find the list of current projects to be incomplete supposed to do? Why not have a complete index and description of all current projects so people can find opportunities to contribute? I dont think they all should be completely public but the existence of the project should be public as well as how people can get involved.Think about it If there was a wellpublicized list sourceoftruth of ongoing projects the guy who started this thread would have probably seen his idea was already being worked on and gotten involved. There are a lot of duplicatedsimilar ideas that can be deduped or combined ex two different microsite hosting sites... one for full hosting and one for wordpress microsites can combine features to make one hosting site that allows all of those options. I think its great that theres a slack and most collaboration happens there but the slack isnt open it doesnt help people go from mph to involved. There are a lot of mechanisms available for that for example the survey where you submit your skills and the Current Projects wiki but they are not being used effectively. ,CodersForSanders,cutnkhl,1,t5_38p5e

6119603,0,t1_cyl85an,Im in the same boat actually. Really interested to see how Web Components develop out the near future there are definitely restrictions with MV frameworks.Angularjs sort of hides a lot of the magic which is burdensome unless you do investigative work and know your JavaScript patterns.But for some reason companies are willing to fork out figures for angularjs developers lol,CodersForSanders,cyl8ho2,1,t5_38p5e

7144642,0,t1_d1q9ic8,The idea isnt necessarily to compete or pull traffic. I regularly check rGrassrootsSelect and it appears many times its filled with all kinds of names when the purpose is to promote activism much like SFP. We feel that the other sub will at least provide a repository for different candidates much like a bunch of Wikipedia pages. Worse comes to worse nothing comes out of this. In no way is this a competition though. I see it as complimentary.,CodersForSanders,d1q9qvo,3,t5_38p5e

They appear to have blatantly lied about freely enabling email just by asking they told me to get Google business email accounts which costs money.
