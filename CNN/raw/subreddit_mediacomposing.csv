4000538,0,t3_36an0a,Beautiful mood and good mixdown. One critique I have is that the same musical idea is repeated over and over. You can jump from the start of the track to the end and the only difference is that there are more instruments playing. Also the drums may be a bit too dominantoff are the samples in the correct key?But if youre consciously going for musical minimalism then theres no issue with repetition and little evolution.,mediacomposing,crcajxm,1,t5_2ycxd

7418383,0,t3_4gw33h,this is a really good question. i think everyone runs into this trouble repeatedly throughout their careers. sometimes its when youre trying to branch out into new areas. never composer for free unless you absolutely want to be part of a project. for example working on something you truly believe in or working with someone who you know will be able to help you out in some other way. im currently working but im offering cut rates in a specific area of composition that i want to work in more often. im not sure if you live in a city but being out there really helps. just be out at clubs bars music events and other events in related fields. go to your local film fests. go to screenings of shorts. find out whos animating or who could possibly in some way benefit from hiring you. its hard. and there are days where you feel like throwing in the towel. but something busts through eventually. in the meantime diversify. try to work in all sorts of related fields even if its just editing voiceover for your universitys multimedia exhibit or whatever. all of this can subsidize your time and other work. save everything you work on. it all becomes useful eventually. im sure someone else will reply to you with all sorts of links to things like mandy.com royalty free music sites or digital asset stores for games. theyre out there. they exist. start digging. ,mediacomposing,d2lf7n2,2,t5_2ycxd

9043541,0,t1_d7y35x7,Thank you for the feedback!  You are the third person to mention implementing counter melodies into my tracks.  I really need to do some more studying and develop my compositions a bit more.  I am curious as to what you would put into the song as a counter melody.  Thanks again for your comment! ,mediacomposing,d7yw0bv,1,t5_2ycxd
