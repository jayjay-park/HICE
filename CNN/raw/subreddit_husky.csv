788345,0,t3_236gvi,Spend some time being his boss. Dont take him for walks until he sits at the door dont give him his bowl of food until he listens to a command or two. Initiate the idea that you are in charge and see where that takes you. I have two half breeds the first and older one is very stubborn and did the same thing when I rescued her last year. One thing Huskies want to do is what they want to do... so if you are stopping that from happening they are forced into listening. Be sure you are praising him a TON when he does things you do like. I still coo and make a big deal about my two going potty outside and Ive not had  an accident in a long long time. I praise them for deciding to lay in the living room floor instead of the kitchen when I cook and I also give them love for not jumping up on my bed right after mudrun at the river. Most dogs love getting praise and they will repeat good behaviors based on that alone. Despite what you may think about your dog being an asshole most of them really are assholes in some way lol  He does want to make your happy! You are just giving him either the wrong signals or he hasnt decided making you happy matters to him yet. Give him a reason to care   Good luck.,husky,cgtw08y,8,t5_2roay

3227753,0,t3_2uztsx,I know its really hard with them. They looooove to run. even when mine is tired hell get right back up and keep running. One thing i have noticed is that he runs away to explore something new or to chase something thats run by the yard. They are quite loving dogs in their own quirky way and most are very loyal. The biggest issue is exercise. Most that dont get enough exercise will run even more. Mine is extremely loyal very loving and will sprint off at a moments notice now that he can outrun me. But he runs off sees what he wants and then when i finally find get close enough to see him hell come back at the sound of his name. Perhaps take a day to take a really long walk with your pup if you can. If your dog will fetch try that for a while. Some tug of war or some of those dog toys that dispense treats if you solve them. It could be a question of boredom. If you would like any help youre welcome to PM me. I have two and both of them spent about a year living in a place with an unfenced backyard. They did great and learned to recall with a specific whistle on the first or second try. I understand living conditions are often hard to fix but i would be willing to help you figure out the best way to remedy the situation without spending anything or very little. ,husky,cowk7rc,1,t5_2roay

3342920,0,t1_cp9aghw,Huskies vary a lot in weight. Adult males are supposed to be between  and  pounds. Mine was  pounds when we last took him to the vet at  months old. He is pure bred Siberian Husky and he is a lean muscular dog. . pounds is definitely at the top end of the scale for  weeks for a pure bred but not unheard of. Malamutes and Siberians are often interbred so you are correct he could possibly be a mix. ,husky,cp9bg3n,6,t5_2roay

Didnt seem like there was much consensus between professionals....That said we did love the covered office visits if we thought anything was wrong we just brought our dogcat in no muss no fuss.  It did help contain costs when our dog was going through separation anxiety when we first got her and we never felt like our animals werent taken care of.

This drives my dog nuts and he has to zoomie to escape. Its adorable. Just be careful not to hurt him. Also I have a Springer attachment for my bike.

They definitely miss playing with each other but the stitches will come out soon.His first outing into the dog park went quite well!  he started out jumping up on the bench with a couple other guys in the park and did nip a few times but he never got aggressive so nobody was worried.  He did start playing with some other dogs after about  minutes or so so i call it a successful night!  Will definitely go back more often.  Thanks guys for helping put my mind at ease.

8137083,0,t1_d4ufae4,This visual had me in stitches. My mix just pants harder and tries to sneak into my lap as we get closer to her favorite places. It starts with resting her chin on the center console then she sneaks a foot in next to her face and leverages herself forward with the tenacity and precision of a cat stalking her prey. The last stage is her literally snaking her way into my lap as if she had no legs. It takes  of us to hold her back. ,husky,d4uoklw,4,t5_2roay

One resource Ive found encouraginghelpful so far is Youtube.

9645149,0,t3_5d5mes,Ive heard of using a weighted vest on walks but Ive never tried it so I cant say how good that is.Personally I dont know how anyone does this without two to play with eachother and a fenced in backyard. Luckily Once they got to be about  years old their buckets of energy calmed down a little bit.The only tiny bit of advice I do have is I found my huskies will spend hours meticulously trying to dismantle a good chew toy. The two that seem to take up most of their time are the KONG brand wubba ball. They both love that thing and it takes them a couple months to destroy. And one of those big femur Nyla bones. Just watch out for those things and replace them fairly often... one for sanitary reasons and two because It turns into a medieval spike mace that youll regret getting when you kickstep on it the first time.,husky,da1ypp8,1,t5_2roay

9966428,0,t1_db5wwdp,Hmm yeah.  Brought the new husky home yesterday and its been hell ever since.  Wondering if I made the wrong decision.  My GSD is super calm extremely intelligent and only wants to please.   The Husky seems all over the place ready to dart out at any squirrel or duck and just doesnt seem to listen very well.  Granted I know its only the first day and lots of adjusting still to do but my GSD is growling at the husky his hairs stand on his back and Ive already had to break up  fights from the Husky getting out of his enclosure and ending up loose in the house.  Doesnt seem like my GSD is warming up to him at all and he just seems a bit restless and on edge about this new dog.   I hope it works out Im keeping them separate for the first  days since the Husky just got neutered  but any time they see each other theres a growling and barking faceoff.    I can get my GSD to lay down and sit in those times and he listens but only because the Husky is in an enclosure.   If they happen to be able to get to each other its gonna be a fight.   Im gonna give it a little time and give it a chance for the next  weeks but I wont keep the Husky if my GSD doesnt acclimate to him.   I hope it works but I dont have very high hopes as of now.     But yeah my GSD is NOT getting neutered just to accommodate another dog. ,husky,db6ngz8,1,t5_2roay

10684668,0,t3_5sv1pk,The most important thing to note about huskies is that they are very very stubborn so you have to be firm in your conviction. Any sign of wavering and they will play you. Rules must be rules and you have got to be persistent and consistent. For the biting the way i trained my puppy to stop was by flicking him one the nose every time he nipped not hard just a gentle reminder not to do it using the word no in conjunction. As for the potty training you have to try to get on a routine if in the morning he drinks some water try to take him outside and wait as long as you can. Try staying in one place and not walking around to much as he might get too distracted. And most of all good luck and have fun.Hes adorable by the way,husky,ddi1jn2,4,t5_2roay

11650051,0,t3_6643l0,Sorry if any of this is obvious just covering bases. As youre aware huskies are... Insane and intelligent. So keeping them in the yard happy and not destructive can be a chore depending on the dog. Firstly TALL fence. They can jump. Wood over chainlink because they can climb. Chicken wire buried at the base of the fence. They dig. Keep things they can climb away from the fence. Theyll climb on the doghouse and jump the fence. Now for fun... Sticks. Bury a kiddie pool. If you dont bury it theyll drag and destroy it. Huskies like cavesbeing enclosedhidden so a doghouse that simulates that helps. Sticks Another dog to play with More sticksAny toys you give himher will die violently and get flung when you mow. Microchip the pup for sure if you leave the doggie door unlocked whilst youre gone and a wireless fence may be a good idea for a while. One last thought. Huskies are terrible guard dogs and a doggie door is the favorite route of entry for burglars. ,husky,dggjpq5,1,t5_2roay
