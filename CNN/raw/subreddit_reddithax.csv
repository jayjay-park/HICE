1268397,0,t1_ci933nv,gt With four lettersdigits it should be possible to fit all of that in and not even interfere with actual language codes or other conventionsI did some experimenting and that doesnt seem to work sadly. frXX.reddit.com doesnt seem to make reddit go to french and because of the way the language prefix thing works it seems to default to english even if the user has their language set to something else a problem with the two letter prefix tooI might try and see if I can contribute a pull request to the reddit code that will have it default to the users language rather than english. Thisll make the subdomain css hack a bit more internationalfriendly,reddithax,cicb7mz,3,t5_2qtkl

4062134,0,t1_crjaf0h,For the button itself I copied the stylesheet from rnotbutton iirc but in the real css the button is restyled collapse expand button but I changed it so the time in post becomes the button.For the lock it is restyled collapse expand button.For the timer amp participants counter its just some elements and given before or after pseudo element with the content of something like  and the width of the element is made the same as the width of one character and I made the number change using overflowhidden and moving the numbers its like the number lock in luggages.Im pretty sure my explainations arent very good if you have any other questions just ask me.,reddithax,crjb9no,1,t5_2qtkl

4409992,0,t1_csl03ra,That makes sense.  Could we use a sprite sheet to give different emblems to various things?  I was thinking about creating one a while back but we didnt really have a use for it then.,reddithax,csmqokj,1,t5_2qtkl
