There are many baby boomers that were an overpopulation to begin with and they are now clogging the works of careers with their presence.  they are also living longer thanks to modern medicine although you cant really fault them on that.  after they die out the world will be begging for people like you. there is also a piece of advice from chan which i have procrastinated showing one because im sure its been shown and two because for people next to suicide it might not help much.  but you are as you claim intelligent... ,sad,cf9luix,1,t5_2qhja

1588596,0,t3_2cgnod,Hi. It is completely normal to feel extra vulnerable when you move away from home and maybe feel isolated and lonely in the new place.  I think most people have felt this way at some point in their life but like you they try to hide it when in public.  Especially for men you were conditioned by society to not show your emotional side.  Crying to heartwarming or tragic films is totally normal and even therapeutic.  However if you start crying and cannot seem to stop there maybe something more serious happening.I understand you dont want to scare your nephew but you need to start Skyping with him again dont hold back because you are expecting yourself to cry as soon as you see him.  By not allowing yourself to see him you are probably making everything feel worse.  Hang in there Christmas is only in a few months ,sad,cjfewpl,1,t5_2qhja

It sounds like you two had been talking throughout the duration of the breakup thus far and then she decided she didnt want to continue that. Your first and biggest mistake was not cutting off contact immediately upon breaking up  but I know from experience how thats so much easier said than done. I did basically the same thing as you. The thing that helped me to finally get over my ex was literally leaving the country and going on a trip abroad for a few weeks where I had almost no internet access and no phone and was busy doing awesome shit the whole time so I didnt care.Im not saying you necessarily need to jump on a plane to another continent although it would probably help! but start focusing on yourself now. Treat yourself well and work on bettering yourself. I can assure you youre no where near the only person in the world whos felt that their world was ending due to a breakup. It is insanely painful and I know you legitimately feel like youll never experience happiness again. But as someone whos been there you will.

9689011,0,t1_da7cczs,I think it would be very rare to find people who could not have the possibility of improving their life or being somewhat happy with it and to be honest Im generally a pessimistic person.  I do think youre correct though in saying that sometimes things like this can be unavoidable based on the way were conditioned and what we expect but I think that typically we can do a lot to change our thinking.It would be unreasonable to be happy only if you were the richest person in the world and I feel like someone who is unwilling to change this sentiment would lead an unhappy life.  However if we make the effort to view the world in different ways then we can find ways to be happy.  Personally Ive been having the worst semester of my life but what cheers me up every night is looking up and seeing how beautiful the moon is then thinking about how lucky I am to have this life to live.  To give another example Im sure that many monks are happy and at peace with their lives but they dont have what people would call a great life.  The thing is though that they do so much introspection and think so much that theyve come to realize what it means for them to be happy.  However Im sure for many of them it took quite some time of changing the way they think and gaining a new perspective on the world.Hopefully all of that made sense.,sad,da7djgk,1,t5_2qhja

With that said I still make mistakes. She gets triggered and she bites. She has never been a hard biter so its not hard like you describe but it is violence for her. Okay so why did I just tell you this. The point is dogs are just like us. Things set them off! Even if its something simple that hasnt been an issue before. Like the person before me mentioned age is a factor. Bring her to a vet and do some tests to be sure. But in terms of the bad memory it happened! Your dog is totally normal! Remember the love.
