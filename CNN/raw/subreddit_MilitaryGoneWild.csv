1298412,0,t1_ciadaul,I dont see a mail from you so Ill respond to this instead.  As uMonosentence said naming anyone unless they are doing it themselves or with permission from the one being named is strictly against Reddit TOS and the rules of this sub.  If we mods see any submission with visible names on uniforms or dogtags we will remove it and the user will receive a warning. Repeated breaks and it will most likely result in a temp or permanent ban depending on severity.  To be safe always blur names and never mention their names or station in text.,MilitaryGoneWild,cifos62,3,t5_2ueeh
