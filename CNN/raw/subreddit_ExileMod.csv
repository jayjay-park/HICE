5465191,0,t1_cw9sbx9,No exile was just released a couple months ago. Exile is like Epoch it is more of a foundation mod. If you are referring to the dayz exile video from Frankie sorry but that video was a sham. It was scripted gameplay. Those zeds dont exist.  ,ExileMod,cwa8acv,3,t5_38h1z
5553373,0,t1_cwl3o8l,Or just follow that  If you feel comfortable it is quite easy to setup the status bar and stuff. If you want to get your custom mods working it can be a bit more difficult. But this guide will work for trader cities etc.However if you want your traders to sell modded items you are going to need their class names etc.,ExileMod,cwlg2y4,1,t5_38h1z
5557622,0,t1_cwlg4g4,gt TFR is a great addon it really is but it mainly works for RP or milsim.Im asking for it to be on a PVE server which in some ways is a bastardized version of an RP server. Also ArmaIII is a milsim game the tactics communications and strategies players use are all militarily inspired. gt I would see no reason why people would use it in their private group unless it was forced as it is only placing a handicap on yourself. While I see your point that it does indeed put your team at a disadvantage not being able to communicate with each other no matter how far you are from one another I feel it would add a level of immersion and realism that many players would find pretty cool. It may take some time to adjust but in the end I feel everyone would benefit from the enhanced communication. gt People around your vicinity can hear you talking to your group and you cannot talk to your group if they are not in your vicinity.Last night I was on the PVE server I play on Esseker and was overlooking a mission being completed by  teammates. They had no idea I was there. One died then respawned in the nearest spawn city and rode a quad bike directly back to the mission as fast as they could. It took less than  minutes and they were never far enough apart that it would make a difference in the range of communications. The shortest range radio in TFR is km the long range are km for backpackvehicle radios and km for airborne radios. For Chernarus I could see a the distance being a factor but for EssekerBornholmLingor I dont see a problem. ,ExileMod,cwlz2rn,1,t5_38h1z

8284642,0,t3_4srg8o,Its just so weird that we arent hearing from Bohemia or anyone involved in the Exile mod that they are working on it. Its just basically unplayable at the moment. I can get in a few servers and only by loading the mods in a certain order and connecting through the stock arma  launcher when starting Arma itself. Only certain servers work though and only about  of the time.this thread has helped a lot of people so you can read through that and see if it works for you,ExileMod,d5d50rm,1,t5_38h1z

Norma Magnum or the Navid .mm with a decent longrange scope AMS Khalia LRPS because they can be zeroed out past .km and provide oneshot kills at those distances while having  rounds per belt mag.Theyre even more potent closerange just spray the area down with suppressive fire.
