7910799,0,t3_4l2m7r,The Anycar box is a very good solution although it isnt cheap. Bought mine with blutooth USB and card reader for . You can get one without blutooth a lot cheaper.,e46,d458yi9,1,t5_2t0qq

8551813,0,t3_4wtdmn,That mirror is toast. Had the same issue with mine. Youll need a new mirror or get it repaired. A new one should just be plug and play.  Edit be super careful installing a new one or reinstalling this one after its been repaired  its easy to break the mount off the inside of the windshield. ,e46,d6ajsqt,1,t5_2t0qq

8751555,0,t1_d6yu5tx,You could always try and find a used set from the forums or try going junkyard hunting for a supercharger and machine the fittings to make it work with your engine. Probably better to stick with the kits or a shop though if you want FI as both come with warranties and support. Or go turbo if you want to go cheaper. ,e46,d6zlng8,1,t5_2t0qq

8993768,0,t3_53g99n,I think what you need to do is check with a volt meter to see if power is being sent to the parking light that isnt working. If there is no power then check cable connections to the headlight for poor connections. ,e46,d7swtrz,1,t5_2t0qq
9094787,0,t1_d84z7jm,Expansion tank is the tank with the coolant filler cap. My radiator had a leak and so did the junkyard one I installed. Bought a new radiator and now its all good. ,e46,d851q0z,1,t5_2t0qq
