1770026,0,t3_2eqjw9,What sets this beer fest apart from all the other beer fest in NC. Also in past AMAs there was talk about how beer fest have not been very supportive of the breweries pouring at the fest. Sometimes not buying beer and pretty much making the breweries pay out of pocket for everything while the beer fest profits. Where does the High Country Beer Fest stand on this?,ncbeer,ck29mzs,2,t5_2yka5

3291987,0,t1_cp3hy23,Theyve been solid across the board for me. Burial is good. I think Ive had the same coffee saison and it was so different. I love saisons I love cold pressed coffee and I could drink that thresher saison on the daily.       Skillet is supposed to be one of their regularcanned offerings too.. so dont lose hope. Its freaking delicious.     Side note If you like coffee beers try the AMBFonta Collaboration Baba Budan. Solid. ,ncbeer,cp3ihf1,2,t5_2yka5
3394540,0,t1_cpf6xqz,I figure I would save most of the triangle because its only an hour give or take from my house  and I have to make it to Asheville sober so I can only stop at a few haha. White Street kolsh is good Id be curious to try some more of what they have to offer. As for smoked esb sounds like something Id be interested in I like trying anything out of the ordinary . I hope to hit up Pisgah but my main concern is wicked Weed. I have had a few Pisgah beers its been a while. ,ncbeer,cpf7d6f,2,t5_2yka5

4380296,0,t3_3b6pvk,Finished my last Coffee is for Closers from Fullsteam earlier in the week. Might have had a sample from an asyettoopen brewery last night. And then also last night I went to The Unknown Brewing Co. and had their Amalgamation which was a bourbon barrelaged dark sour ale brewed with blueberries and smoked peppers. To be honest I didnt expect it to work as well as it did. It was pretty tasty with a nice little bite from the peppers on the finish. ,ncbeer,csje7st,3,t5_2yka5

5890055,0,t3_3vxvdh,I would suggest hitting Unknown Brewery and Wooden Robot as they are less than a mile apart and are both solid choices and both dont really see the crowds NoDa and Birdsong get. NoDa and Birdsong are pretty close to each other as well just on the other side of the city. Triple C is another good one to stop in on and Sycamore is pretty close to Triple C. Really you could start on South Blvd at Triple C and work your way north ending at the new NoDa taproom on North Tryon. ,ncbeer,cxrpxxb,3,t5_2yka5
6410118,0,t3_43c6xo,I would love it if cans made their way across the state.  I had their French Toast Stout on tap a year or two ago and thought it was fantastic.  I remember liking it better than other french toast beers since then.  ,ncbeer,czi9l1p,1,t5_2yka5

Being where Asheville is you can cross state lines easierfaster than getting to the other end of our state.    That being said Id sure appreciate being able to pop in to bottle shops inaround wilmington when Im there and being able to snag cans of burial. ,ncbeer,d23xs6x,2,t5_2yka5
7323054,0,t1_d2afz35,Didnt think about Green Man but that does seem like one they might go for. I hope it does not of course. If buyouts happen I hope its bigger craft buying smaller craft. Like a Sierra Nevada or Oscar Blues. ,ncbeer,d2akxbe,3,t5_2yka5
7814005,0,t1_d3u6e0t,Commonly maybe but there are enough differences I dont think they are really the same. You can brew a tart and brew other beers after it where the bacteria that makes a sour you cant get out of the fermenter. The flavors are distinctly different. Even Wicked Weed is careful to label their beer tart or sour depending on where it gets the flavor.Im slightly confused now. I will be asking a brewer for clarification.,ncbeer,d3ucwub,1,t5_2yka5

9991591,0,t1_db9vsox,Thanks Ive been told to pick two though i might be able to squeeze in an extra depending on how much time we have.

11469648,0,t3_63pd4s,My family lives in Calabash. There are some bars at Ocean Isle that are ok and Little River that have views but are old people and shitty food but my favorites are in North Myrtle  Cherry Grove. There are a lot of bars on the actual beach in CG and if you follow that road south theres a whole row of bars with rooftops and shag. Theyre all near The Spanish Galleon. Theres New South Brewing in south Myrtle. A lot of younger locals like Broadway at the Beach bars and theres Liberty Brewing which is actually decent. The entire area isnt really that big on craft beer unfortunately but there will be a brewery going in at Shallote soon. ,ncbeer,dfw2ukt,2,t5_2yka5
