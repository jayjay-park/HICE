215736,0,t3_1wkqbg,From the trailer it looks pretty damn poor IMO. I didnt even smile at a single joke and often with comedies like this the best jokes are in the trailer so yeah... i wont be seeing it.,CasualFilm,cf30m68,6,t5_3028e
217859,0,t1_cf32qiz,gt. The Great BeautyThis is rather surprisingly a great movie. The last Italian movie to hit the art house circuit I am Love was a depressing collection of longagooutdated clichs that even the makers must have had trouble taking seriously.

464917,0,t3_1zd2g2,A number of animated films. Apart from the obvious Pixar ones like The Incredibles or Up there is How to train your dragon Tangled and possibly Frozen now. Spirited Away is probably already in the modern classics category.,CasualFilm,cft4274,5,t5_3028e
