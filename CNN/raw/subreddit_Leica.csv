582169,0,t1_cg5zcmq,Thanks!  My friend actually has a rigid summicron so I could easily compare the two before buying.  The summitars soft corners and crazy bokeh dont bother me too much.  If anything I kind of like the Leica glow that comes from it being a little softer wide open.  I should shoot a test chart with my friends lens and mine to see if I want to throw the money around.  Stopped down to f. I think the summitar is still far sharper than my other vintage mm lenses.A summilux would be interesting.  Ive also thought about a Zeiss mm f ZM or f. ZM just to have something with a different look.Out of curiosity how do you digitize your film?  Now that Im running more rolls through the M Im thinking about a dedicated film scanner but nothing seems to be the same quality or convenience as the old discontinued Nikon scanners. ,Leica,cg6g3ki,2,t5_2s4wm
837843,0,t3_23l1k9,I have a Zeiss planar that I regularly use on my leica digital and film bodies.  I really like the Zeiss.  It always looks great.  I dont have any problems or qualms about it.  That being said Ive occasionally wondered what it would be like to have the summicron instead.  And I begin to get G.A.S.y... The most absurd reason Ive given myself is filter sizes.  Because I also use the mm elmarit which uses the mm filters.  So I typically need to carry two sets of filters with me.  Im currently saving for the summilux asph but I believe the planar will still be on my daily carry.  ,Leica,cgzikjv,3,t5_2s4wm

If you get one make sure to grab the mrc version unless youre a fan of noticeable vignetting. I also recommend the Voigtlander hood. The price is high USD but its incredibly well built. ,Leica,cmbea3b,2,t5_2s4wm

Combine that willingness to spend silly money on silly products with the name cachet that Leica brings to the table and you have a real potential winner on your hands at least in the making significant coin sense.Fuji gets the marketing power and cachet associated with the Leica brand.

It sounds like you are getting by at the moment with what you have so it doesnt sound like a lens emergency.  That way you can build up a decent pile of loot while you decide exactly what lens would make you happy going forward.Ive said this before but I really think that if you are going to just have one fast lens it should be a .  It looks like you can score an early summilux from the continent for about k pounds.

10416161,0,t1_dcohbjw,In terms of developing and processing the whole equipment is very small. You dont need an enlarger or trays or anything like that. It would easily fit in a small space especially if stacked carefully.The scanner is about the size of a loaf of bread so is also small. However if price is an issue then having your film scanned professionally is an expensive but available option. Either way I think its definitely worth learning to and developing your own film. Unless you live near a pro lab its difficult slow and expensive to have black and white developed professionally whereas developing your own film is methodical easy and fun as well as being extremely cheap.Im surprised you cant edit photos on your computer though. My desktop is a  tower from  and my laptop is  from . Both are perfectly adequate.Edit As a more useful guide Ive put together a couple of terrible photos that give a scale of my blackandwhite development kit including a guide to whats in the kit and several options to make it even smaller some at the cost of increased water use. ,Leica,dcoqna0,1,t5_2s4wm

All things being equal youll know or you wont whether its worth it and only you can answer that question. That said the BampW capabilities of the M are said to be amazing due to its inherent need of the UVIR cut filters. Almost monochrom level crop factor aside but I have no direct experience with this. If youre into BampW this might make it even more worth while for you. ,Leica,dedpfd0,2,t5_2s4wm
