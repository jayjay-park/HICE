5656552,1,t3_3sjb2j,Heh. Smart move OP. I wouldnt want to touch them with a foot pole after seeing both accounts. xD,GrinningGoat,cwy90rr,3,t5_3arcy
5663121,0,t1_cwywrwu,Yes but if the Restaurant becomes famous and profitable off the work of that chef and food critics come to your restaurant and specifically compliment that chef and a rating of chefs puts your chef at  then when your chefs contract expires you might not be looking at the same great deal you had when you started.,GrinningGoat,cwz2cv2,2,t5_3arcy
5670396,0,t3_3ssd54,Oh title is worded funny. This post is about the Class Bonus on the Discover Mechanic it doesnt talk about the arena.,GrinningGoat,cwzyvkv,2,t5_3arcy
6700321,0,t3_479kva,Run ended a notveryexciting . I did not see Ysera even oncenot so much as in a mulligan. Foe Reaper helped me win my th but Id have won without him. In my third loss it may have been better to play him than some of the removal combos I resorted to towards the end but Ill never know.As though to punish me for doing nothing interesting with an interesting draft I got  gold and a plain card and the pack was pure dust. I will continue my campaign to send whoever thought plain cards should be an Arena reward to jail.,GrinningGoat,d0cddhy,1,t5_3arcy
6720669,0,t1_d0ed44d,Yeah I was just wondering as an alternative to HearthArena.  I figure that program will be inconsistent when so many new cards hit the Arena meta.   If there was a time for ADWCTA to make a competing system I figure it would be for this Expansion.,GrinningGoat,d0eh49r,3,t5_3arcy
6985477,0,t3_4b9ms1,I dont think too many Keepers is an issue mostly because they can be played on turn  as a perfectly acceptable   card or  mana for  stats on Silver Hand Knight obviously not as good but also not that much worse than an average drop.Once you have enough cards for curve you want to pick bigger minions if your deck is trending toward the value game or you want to pick tempo swing cards if your deck is trending toward aggressive.  A midrangy  tempoy  normal Arena deck should have some of both type of cards so you can adjust to your opponent.,GrinningGoat,d18572p,1,t5_3arcy
7357260,0,t3_4fyoku,Poor Hunter.. I do think Call of the Wild is so insanely OP a card that it will help carry a good number of runs in the new meta but overall I definitely agree that Hunter is going to have a pretty bad time in a meta filled with Taunts and value cards.,GrinningGoat,d2egxqb,3,t5_3arcy
7648050,0,t3_4k22mm,Thanks for the inputs. I definitely think this was between Yeti and Assassinate as I dont really think I needed another drop at this stage of the draft.I ended up picking Assassinate and was offered a Mechanical Yeti the very next pick so I got to have my cake and eat it too ,GrinningGoat,d3bjhym,3,t5_3arcy
7791041,0,t1_d3rn9fj,Thanks!  We know theres plenty of people out there who like to watch us play overwatch and who will like it more after we get the hang of things were already starting to do a lot more coordinated pushes and callouts offstream and seeing good results.  Well stream Saturday nights still just to get all the Overwatch streaming jinks worked out in preparation for later.  Weve decided to not stream our games Wednesday nights which preserves greater flexibility for us to do other things as well as let us focus on improvement first rather than both improvement and entertainment.  After competitive mode comes out and we get to the tier below the highest tier Ill set up a Getting into Overwatch stream Saturday night that features both me and Merps and well turn it into a Youtube Video and then truly kick off our Overwatch stream. One of the biggest problems right now with doing more Overwatch is our computers really cant handle it very well right now the game has pretty steep requirements and apparently our computers were not built optimally in terms of processor selection.Well be upgrading our equipment over the summer into a dualPC setup so that we can properly stream Overwatch at Ultra nd to highest settings p fps or at least  fps for HS viewers yes this will also improve HSs quality from fps  stuttering during voting to fps no stutter.  gotOmg D,GrinningGoat,d3rrq8y,1,t5_3arcy
8560427,0,t3_4x1fsg,. Pls keep in mind that while tosses streams himself he was still nervous and excited to be on there there where a lot of people watching and thats a natural reaction.I was on stream before too once as sub coachee and once because we were playing overwatch and adwcta joined and we went live. If you are not used to it it will affect your behaviour.. The same applies to any coaching session when guests are on that arent professional streamers there will always be problems with audio levels language barriers etc. Its inevitable but we hope it is not something that turns away people from the stream. Those are special occasions where adwcta and merps try to give something back to those that support them.I appreciate the feedback though and when the coop is known beforehand like this time we may be able to test things and prepare before the stream to avoid people feeling that way lt,GrinningGoat,d6bmpc5,1,t5_3arcy
9308453,0,t1_d8vawl0,Thanks for your response! Yes I already finished this arena run. I aggre with what you said and I also picked the Portal. Sadly I went . I am close to being an infinite arena player . average wins and here is what I was able to determine about why this arena went bad  In my next  draft choices I had to complete the deck I was able to pick  Babbling Book  more Worgen Infintrator  Runic Egg and  Razorfen Hunter. Ended up with  drops and  drops. Runic Egg never had any kind of impact in this arena run. Babbling Book was almost never followes by a drop making it an easy target for an opponents drop in the following turn.   I lacked early game plays in almost every game. I aggresivly mulligan almost all games for  and  drops failed a quite considerable amount of times in actually getting a drop to play. In my mulligans I only kept a drop two times one time was a Spider Tank and the other time was a Spellslinger but now I feel that that was a mistake. I remember that in those games I also never ended up drawing a turn  or turn  play in the mulligan.   Turn  and  plays were almost all the time easily dealt with mostly due to the fact that the opponent already had a board  some kind of early removal making it hard for me o get back in control of the board.In conclusion I feel that the lack of early game caused me most of problems. I feel that I got kind of unlucky in my mulligans but I also now know that I muligganed incorrectly in some cases. I also misplayed at least  time during this arena. Was a bad run and I probably deserved it. Thanks for the opinion about this draft choice was hard for me at the time but Im glad you aggree that the Firelands Portal was the correct choice.,GrinningGoat,d8vwwyl,2,t5_3arcy

11447425,0,t3_63dg5y,I think theres a misunderstanding of Elise. It doesnt shuffle  random cards into your deck it effectively adds a mana Sprint to your deck. Yeah the cards are random not drafted but  cards from a single draw is not going to be a negative effect. ,GrinningGoat,dftk0lr,2,t5_3arcy
11706810,0,t3_66wuq8,Before I stopped using it I found it was over valuing synergies and really pushing deck archetypes. I felt this was costing me about a game per run.,GrinningGoat,dgmzv1e,3,t5_3arcy
