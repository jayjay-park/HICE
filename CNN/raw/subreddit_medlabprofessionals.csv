Obviously I have a ton of antibodies floating around in my plasma against pollen cat dander chicken pox hepatitis B all the various colds I have had etc. But none of these are reactive against red blood cell antigens so they dont come up in blood bank testing.

1362409,0,t3_29oq3y,I work in a blood center but Im in the reference laboratory. I absolutely love my job blood banking really is a passion for me. The pay is a lot more than a hospital but most of us in an IRL are required to have an SBB so that may account for part of it. I find it can be repetitive occasionally it really depends on what kind of workload you get. Working up patient antibodies is always different and can be really interesting. We dont typically get a lot of the common antibodies that hospitals do. There can be other weeks where all I do is antigen type donor units all day every day and it can get monotonous sometimes.Ive never worked in the components lab but Ive heard from some of the techs that it can be crazy. Youve got a time limit to process each unit of whole blood from the time of donation and depending on how collections is doing you can get REALLY busy.

2489074,0,t3_2n8mee,I cant answer your question regarding the helpfulness of MLS in forensics but I can offer some advice that was handed to me a few weeks ago. An alumnus of my university gave a presentation about being hired at the state forensics lab. For her position there were over  applicants. The first thing the hiring manager did was throw away any and all applications that included Criminal Justice or Forensics related majors and minors. Forensics is very saturated right now due to the popularity of TV shows likes CSI. I would strongly advise you to major in a hard science my presenter was a Molecular Biology and Biotechnology major and learn about forensics on the side. First and foremost you will be a scientistlab technician and those are the skills you need to highlight on your application. I would avoid any degree that specializes you in forensics just because it can put you in a corner and block other opportunities in an already competitive field.She seemed pretty adamant about. Just my two cents. Good luck! EDIT I also wanted to add that working in a forensics lab isnt like TV as Im sure youve heard many times. There is a possibility youll be pretty isolated from everything going on in the field. My presenter said most people burn out on the CSItype field work within a year and start trying to switch into the CODIS lab the one that handles the DNA database.

Getting your specialist in something outside of core lab can be valuable becoming a supervisor and using it to get the hospital to buy you an MHAMBA would be more valuable. Its possible a doctorate in CLS may mean something at some point but that still remains to be seen. If you just want to ultimately make more money and you arent wait  years pack it up and move. Thats really all there is to it. Once you have a few years of experience you both have experience which is good and no longer are considered a new grad hire which is also good.

4610297,0,t3_3e53mh,I just started not that long ago in a rather somewhat large hospital.  .  My days tend to vary depending on what department Im working in but I usually start out on daily maintenance and QC followed by standard running testsanswering the phonerandom troubleshooting anything that pops up and finally cleaning up and passing my department off to the next shift of techs..  I love my job!  I get to be part of a vital and often forgotten about area of medicine in a more behind the scenes setting.  The pay can be pretty decent depending where you live and in some places what degree you have.  This job also allows for a bit of freedom in that my manager tends to let us do our work without constantly checking up on any of us..  This job can be a bit stressful at times.  You will find many people outside of the lab tend to look down on you.  These people are not in the majority but it can be a bit shitty when you have someone call in and demand lab results from a patient who has only just arrived in the lab and then berate you for not having it.  This has only happened to me once but I have been told it happens and used to be much more frequent but either way I just let it roll off my shoulders..  The Board of Certification exam given by the ASCP is usually the only exam you need to pass however some other states require an additional certificate California is one I believe.  Once you pass the BOC you are then certified to work nationwide.  You do need to maintain your certification by getting a certain amount of Continuing Education Credits every three years..  Currently I work about  hours a week.  Right now I work  MF but I may soon move to the  night shift.  The hours really depend on where you work and what position you get hired onto..  Kind of answered in  but I would compare the stress level to that of being a cook in a restaurant but far more rewardingless exhausting.I hope this help a little bit.,medlabprofessionals,ctbplbr,6,t5_2xvlm

That may be true but I think its the culture as well. Older techs dont advance out of the lab unless they go into management service etc and have less incentive to fight for better compensation since they have less working life to benefit from it older folks are also famously though not universally more conservative and on top of that theyve already accepted their lot or they wouldnt still be there. Since these same techs also act as leaders and mentors and would necessarily be a part of any organizing efforts I suspect it creates a kind of inertia that would make it difficult for younger techs to organize effectively.Anyway if you couldnt bother about being underpaid for decades and then whine when a new tech gets paid as well as you saying that fighting for higher pay is easier said than done is a pretty poor excuse and its a pretty treasonous move to suggest that new techs should have their pay pushed down just to satisfy your ego.,medlabprofessionals,cwrfv2i,1,t5_2xvlm

If you are the type to get lazy reverse the position every  minutes with a good forearm stretch. When sitting at a scope drop that chair as low as you can so you dont have to hunch over or put reems of paper under the scope and raise it up. Anything to keep a good posture and your feet supported flat on the ground No dangling feet its god awful for your hips and low back longtermSo consider this my best advice to anyone out there surgery when you are in your s is going to suck living with that pain long term because no surgeon is going to green light wrist surgeries in your s sucks even worse.

Ive also looked into other colleges across Canada that accepts outofprovince applicants as a potential place for me to go. Im not entirely sure. Its concerning to see that low of a passing grade. The lax entry requirements may be a factor as Ive seen data through the years that RRC has lower passing grades than other colleges in Canada.

ASCP has a specific page on their website for military applicants Per that pagegtProvided they are in good standing active military personnel currently enrolled in a week U.S. military laboratory specialist course or in a NAACLSABHES accredited medical laboratory technician training program can sit for the ASCP BOC Medical Laboratory Technician MLTASCP certification examination within the last three weeks of Phase II training. Military personnel who have already successfully completed the week U.S. laboratory specialist course NAACLSABHES accredited program and the required education may also apply for certification.I think its a pretty good field to work in especially with the armed forces paying for your education. Civilian MLTs can expect to make on average  a year in the US with significant variation across the country and if you get a bachelors degree you can be an MLS with an average  a year salary. Thats a comfortable middle class wage though you could go farther with a graduate degree and expand into research or management. Or you could go for a physicians assistant or pathologists assistant and break six digits.

Someone has to work those hours and that place has made an investment in you. I think it is fair to ask that you work at least ten months in the shift you signed up for before leaving and that you be open about your plans to go. Obviously there could be bad situations that change this. Ive just seen too many situations where a lab gets stuck in a cycle of hiring new people who quit because there arent enough people for the workload.

11509031,0,t3_63xndo,It can be tough if youre just thrown in there with no training or idea of what to do.  Its more than just being in charge.  Depending on the department there may be a lot of paperwork statistics or reports.One piece of advice I have is to ask who you directly report to what is the expectation.  Nothing like each side expecting something different.First few months I was blood bank supervisor I had no idea there were monthly reports and meetings to go to because the person who left the position for evenings didnt want to help out and the lab manager never told me what he expected.,medlabprofessionals,dg0jtgh,2,t5_2xvlm

11551196,0,t3_64rram,I have been busy at Clinicals so I dont check everyday but its obvious lab week is approaching.The hospital where I do clinicals is telling me they took away pay bonuses etc.. they are also saying many vendors wont even donate food anymore for lab week and nobody wants to pay so they will likely do nothing.Is that just a sign of a bad work envt or is this a trend being basically I lab tech I suppose I should say shift lol?Also while most of my clinicals have gone pretty well there is a person in my department now that is quite belittling to the point where I am scared to ask a question. As someone not employed yet do you suggest I tell their supervisor tell them directly I dont appreciate it tell my trainer let it go something else?,medlabprofessionals,dg5bxq2,1,t5_2xvlm

11625868,0,t3_65l4o4,Our previ isola is always giving us problems. We use it for plating urines only. But its always dropping pipette tips or the labels get messed up or it gives us an error that it dropped plates....Good god its annoying and it happens quite often. Sometimes its just easier hand plating  urines in a shift instead of fighting with a dang instrument. ,medlabprofessionals,dgdsyk4,2,t5_2xvlm

11633854,0,t1_dgeljif,Also an enlisted MLT although Reservist now.  In a hospital setting the officers were pretty solidly management positions and did little to no bench work at all not even during staffing shortages.  Also the officers were further split between the MTs generally O to O and the Pathologists O to O.In a Combat Support Hospital CSH everyone including the officer as it would be unusual to have more than one are expected to bench as well as take care of the supplies blood levels reports to the hospital commander and Wardmaster.  Some of which can be mitigated by the enlisted but ultimately the responsibility falls on the officer.  I have no experience with a BSB setting and cant speak to that at all.,medlabprofessionals,dgepkf2,2,t5_2xvlm
11635388,0,t1_dged0ug,Weeeeell... clots take time to form. Could we get a valid result if you wheeled the patient down to the lab next to the instrument and we ran the specimen the instant it was drawn? Maybe  were talking about a bad draw so even as you hand us the  l or so we absolutely need to even run the test once its already trying to turn into jello and probably diluted by tissue fluid which is going to falsely decrease cell counts and hemoglobin in such a tiny sample but it could work.So is there some realistic theoretical scenario where if youre fast enough and were fast enough we could run the blood in time? Figure theyve got a couple minutes at most to get it from patient to instrument and remember weve got to log it in too  so normally no. About the only way it could actually work is if the patients already got some kind of severe clotting deficiency.So there you go. Theres your edge case where it could actually matter. But that doesnt mean you should get the idea that the lab could prevent redraws if we just hurried up or that bad draws are okay. Get us acceptable specimens to begin with and there wont be an issue.As for the assholes theyre spreading lies faster than we can correct them so Ill call em what I like P,medlabprofessionals,dgevu3p,1,t5_2xvlm
11680358,0,t3_66o5qi,I learned this lesson quick a couple weeks ago.I am newly trained in blood bank and had just completed my training and one of our surgeons basically ordered a massive transfusion without calling down and saying hey! I need a massive transfusion!I ordered a unit of platelets thawed our FFP and Xmatched a few more units due to the verbiage the nurses were using lost cc of blood losing cchr losing blood fast. Sounded like this patient was in trouble. After requesting a unit of platelets from our local supplier I check the patients platelet count about a half hour later AND ITS LIKE . MOTHERF..Totally didnt even think to check the platelets during the whole situation.I called the nurse and said your patient doesnt meet the criteria and we would have to get an okay from our pathologist if you want to transfuse them. The nurse says ok then just forget about the platelets probably.OK THANKS BYE.Yeah learned my lesson there. We credited the unit to another hospital on the next day shift.

11761587,0,t1_dgt5jo0,A lot of people cant stomach drawing blood until they actually do it. I hated the thought! But once I started doing it and focused on getting good at it the jitters went away. Plus a lot of jobs will not require you to draw blood yourself. There are a lot of lab techs who cant draw blood.,medlabprofessionals,dgt7eke,3,t5_2xvlm
