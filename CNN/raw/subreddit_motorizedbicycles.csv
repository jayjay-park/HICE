3213125,0,t3_2wwj55,The easiest bikes to build on for your first time is definitely a cruiser style bike. I personally have a Huffy Cranbrook and it has a really wide open steel frame that is perfect for such a thing. This is my cruiser bike that has a motor on it albeit a strokeLike you said out of the box strokes are a lot more reliable and easy to maintain. The strokes are cheaper but also if you do some key things will last you quite a while and you can find easy aftermarket parts for them to up the power. Sounds like you are doing a great job at researching and I would suggest a complete four stroke kit so you have everything there for you. The huffy cranbrook I bought was under a  bucks at wally world and quite a bit of people use them in there builds. ,motorizedbicycles,cov1hxx,2,t5_2sdck

5973249,0,t3_3x91x9,Something is up with the float or the float needle. When it fills with gas the needle is not closing. Works like the float in your toilet that shuts off after the tank fills.This is for bing carbs but the same rules apply for yours.,motorizedbicycles,cy2mh1f,1,t5_2sdck

6904320,0,t1_d0ypglr,I wouldnt trust it for long. Itll probably snap after a short ride an engine puts out a lot more torque than our legs do.,motorizedbicycles,d0yx9u4,1,t5_2sdck
7692299,0,t1_d3g5k13,Rear mounts always look like that Ive been riding a rear mount for a year and my little cc still looks like that. They are top heavy when parked but I solved that with a better kickstand. Riding it is a different story it feels weird at first especially if your used to the center mount  strokes. But after a month or  of careful riding I can maneuver it as well as my old center mount.Im guessing the extra weight will take some getting used to.,motorizedbicycles,d3gkcpm,1,t5_2sdck
7785006,0,t1_d3ongxa,Hmm. I just put my NT carb back on and tightened everything down. Now its running great. No power loss at full throttle and Its really booking along. Maybe you had something stuck up in the fuel lines? Have you ridden any more lately? ,motorizedbicycles,d3r39e2,2,t5_2sdck
7836715,0,t1_d3wuazz,Its just a straight up china kit from zoombicycles.com The boost bottle is basically just a little bottle and a tube that taps into the intake manifold and what it does is reverbs some of the unburnt fuel vapour back into the cylinder.  It makes the engine run smoother and more efficient Its been raining for  weeks straight when we get a nice day Ill go out and make a little video of what it actually does. ,motorizedbicycles,d3wwx6u,2,t5_2sdck
8470209,0,t1_d609khc,The hose is too long to mount it any further forward without burning up my legs. I think Im going to get one of those carrier racks above the back wheel and mount it there. ,motorizedbicycles,d60bdur,1,t5_2sdck

8935220,0,t1_d7lftd8,No problem had the same issues. I used a slice of thin rubber wrapped around the handle bars and put the mirror bracket over it. I had a roll laying around and also used it around my engine mounts too. Also I added a washer and crunch washer to keep the nut from backing out. For the mirror screw I added some lock tight and it holds it snug enough. Also dont over tighten the mirror screw it can crack the mirror and if you move it around when its too tight the plastic wears down and itll never hold. Ask me how I know lol.,motorizedbicycles,d7lvqlr,1,t5_2sdck
