The  has decent torque an over mile range between fuel ups and if youre comfortable on it youre pretty much good to go. Even bigger bikes will have even more effortless power to stay at  mhp all day long but the Vulcan can absolutely do it if perhaps with a tad bit less effortless aplomb.Any bike can break down obviously but I seriously doubt the Vulcan is especially bad. Just maintain the bike well before setting out fluids new tires probably makes sense so they last the whole way and check the final drive belt for any damage  or at least I think it has a a belt which is good for touring no worries about chain maintenance. And have a plan for what happens when it breaks down or when you get a flat tire which can and will happen to anyone going longer distances.

11004441,0,t1_deas87s,I know I am a few days late on this. But let me toss in my .I ride a VStar  and my father rides a Dyna. A couple things to note from him. Both the best and absolute worst motorcycles he has ever owned were HDs. But one was an AMF era Sportster and the other is this new Dyna. In between he has mostly ridden Japanese motorcycles. Reliability is not really an issue with newer HDs barring the usual abused bikes and occasional lemon outlier. But they do not take poor maintenance favorably so if you are sloppy on that stuff it could be a factor on choosing a brand. And if you are not hands on then you will of course be paying a bit more for a shop. But when people talk about leaking bikes or failing parts you are probably either looking at someone that hasnt been exposed to the bikes personally or people that are mostly familiar with preEvo bikes. The pluses to owning an HD will be the vast aftermarket. Rebuild the motor there are parts for that. Chrome yep someone does that. Boutique handmade pieces you have that too. The aftermarket is flush with Looks or power customizations as well as aftermarket companies just making parts to keep you running stock.A plus and negative is that the price to get into HDs is higher than a Japanese bike. So you will pay more for the Harley in most cases than you will for a similarly equipped Japanese bike. But you also wont see the same level of depreciation. The fun part isnt horsepower on a harley but the torque. Even a TC has enough torque to put you back in your seat. The VStar is good but it just doesnt have that same power band. You will probably like that I know I do. The bad. If you like winding them up Harleys will take some getting used to. I have always ridden Japanese bikes and I am happy wringing them out. So testing out HDs took some getting used to because those habits just dont translate well. Victorys were the closest to that out of American made motorcycles. The handling isnt going to be as good in stock form. Especially if you are on a Softtail. Hard parts hit early where the  will still have room to lean. So if you are an aggressive rider it will be noticed. Just try not to notice it when you are at speed. The leg room. I found that The Heritage Softail was the most comfortable of the modern HDs for legroom but the worst for clearance. In either case stock the bars are closer as are the floorboards. And if you ride pillion a lot they have less room too. The  shines for just sheer space for you and your passenger. Last year I was shopping hard for a replacement bike but ultimately I stuck with the VStar because of three things. My riding habits  I ride aggressive but I also commute. So having bags and a cruiser was good for that. The clearance and decent horsepower was enough to keep me engaged. I am not a hard customizer so while I will most likely add a power commander and pipes and such in the future it isnt my primary concern. The price. I am paying for a new bike that costs only a fraction more than what you are paying for a used harley. The comfort for my wife and myself out of the box. The  seat sucks but after a few years and the miles I put on it it is finally shaped right for my butt. My wife has plenty of room to shift around and get mostly comfortable on longer rides. Neither of us feel crowded and any additions to make it more comfortable for the long haul are minimal. But if I had a good HD deal come around I would snap it up too. Especially if it was cheap enough to customize it to fit my style and needs. ,cruisers,defblrs,3,t5_2sekc
