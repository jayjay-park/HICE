6948828,0,t3_4aujwy,Not really a champ you want to go for early items. You want your core items over anything thats because what lulu benifits the most off of. Morellos for mid into dcap mid and for top i would say getting roa into dcap the following up with ludens for both. Generally you want cdr or sustain no matter what because lulu isnt about the holy shit damage its about sustain long fights where big shields and big deeps shine ,lulumains,d13zc09,3,t5_35l0h
7119382,0,t3_4d1urc,I dont think there is any case that would justify maxing W first. Most standard is RQWE. If behind or playing defensively REWQ. The slight extension in movespeed and polymorph duration and cooldown isnt really worth the extra damage or extra shielding.,lulumains,d1ndynn,1,t5_35l0h

9813958,0,t1_dalqy1a,actually just had a  lulu game where i got an s. im not sure but overall just playing REALLY GOOD and keeping people alive wing the right targets and overall being very effective is the key to getting an S even though thats obvious. just saying you could die more than  times and still get an S,lulumains,dams3bu,1,t5_35l0h
9965677,0,t3_5i9tg3,Im quite tired right now so Ill just address a couple of points. Swifties are highly conditional. Mobis are my go to boots since you build a ton of items with CDR on Lulu but I can understand Lucidity too. Mobis gt Swifties because of roaming placing wards more quickly and safely and just general mobility. Swifties generally imply that you are going to be slowed in particular when you want to stick to a target. Given Lulus role in fights this is not a problem so really only build swifties under rare conditions when you are steamrolling game and want to run people down mobis still often better for this Reason you use w on ally is to chase people down. ADC appreciates atk speed buff. Sometimes you will find its too dangerous to approach enemies to use polymorph so rather than not use give it to teammates. Also use w to help push towers faster.  Thunderlords gt windspeakers imo because if you are going windspeakers Karma is generally a better choice unless you really need that extra bit of hard cc from ult  polymorph If you go windspeaker become shieldheal bot rush redemption and locket. Generally I prefer thunderlords because lane domination and gives extra damage if you are making picks. Her damage remains fairly good through game if you dont fall behind and build more magelike. Both are pretty good though my playstyle just suits tld. good luck!,lulumains,db6jxzp,2,t5_35l0h

10369432,0,t1_dcjedgh,Jannas role is much more important than Lulus. Lulus role which is peel and frontline participation also buffing but lets take that out of the equation can also be done by any god damn tank.But Jannas role which is disengage or counterengage is much less available in league and will be much more beneficial than a Lulu considering you already have a tank on top or Jungle. The only other champion I can think of that does a similiar job is Poppy but Poppy is broken and overloaded anyway so that doesnt really count.You have to see it like thatLulu is just a teamcomp ENHANCER.But Janna is a CORNER STONE of many many teamcomps that couldnt even work without Jannas incredibly powerful skillset.,lulumains,dcjfqur,1,t5_35l0h
10487719,0,t1_dcwsm1j,Im dusting off the old lulu top and finding that the buffs are massive. So much easier wave clear and last hitting which opens up the opportunities for plays. I too am struggling how best to harness this new power. I think rushing for  cdr is smart and being moderately tanky. Mid game lulu after rushing morellos is super strong but  leaves you susceptible to burst. I am going to try a ice born gauntlet build for top and see how it goes. What are other people trying?,lulumains,dcww517,1,t5_35l0h
10547638,0,t1_dcwnfws,Yes. There are attack speed at which you lose damage due to pix being unable to fire on some AA. ,lulumains,dd3oy4b,1,t5_35l0h
10636759,0,t1_ddd22z6,point one agreed doesnt mean u shouldnt do itpoint  agreedpoint  if they dont they fuktpoint  i think you should be able to keep up to at least  cs behind not  if you practice enough to be proficient. Even though poly morph doest stop her chain i dont think its an excuse to be  cs behind unless the opposing player is just beyond your skill level where all my arguments become completely irrelavant.,lulumains,ddd3m6x,1,t5_35l0h
10718110,0,t3_5taz7d,Criticism  good guide lmao very long but quite entertaining to read so good job on that could be one of my guides IF I WOULD EVER FINISH ONE. It would be a lot more easier to understand matchup difficulty or synergy with a rating from like  to  or something like Easy Medium Hard Nightmare FFZyra. Editing would be very nice. I disagree on the Janna matchup Lulu actually counters Janna imo. Lulus shield scales a lot better and while Jannas ultimate is easily disruptable with Whimsey or a Flash Ult yours isnt. Jannas CC is also inferior to yours in lane and a lot less reliable due to being a skillshotdodgeable. The only place where Janna is slightly better is if she gets to heal her entire team with a full ultimate in a teamfight and comps that are built around her disengage. Janna might be the better champion but she doesnt counter Lulu in any way. Lulu just has to play it offensively and she should win in lane and will later outscale in teamfights with a super buffed ADC. sry for the rant lul Jhin  Lulu synergy My best friend is a Jhin main. We have been playing hundreds of Lulu Jhin bot lanes against any matchup and all I can say is that the synergy is incredibly underrated but only in one case. Jhin is not allowed to play like an AD Caster he has to play like an AA heavy champion. Very commonly known that Jhin is very similiar to AD casters with his Ult and W he still is able to AA. And if your Jhin decides to actually go ham with his AAs Lulu and Jhin can be devastating. What many dont know is that the movement speed part of his passive SCALES with ATTACK SPEED. That makes him paired with a Lulu the most mobile ADC in the game literally. He loses his main weakness as immobile ADC dont forget about that. Also people just dont want to see what the actual value of Lulu buffs means for Jhin because he is no AS heavy carry. Yeh he sure isnt an AS carry like Vayne but he scales with AS and that really well. Late game your Censer Shield and W can give him more than  AD  GOLD VALUE. That is absolutely insane. Also more than Janna could ever offer him for .. Jhin and Lulu are a decently synergizing bot lane. If Vayne is S Tier synergy then I would say that Jhin is definitely A Tier.Well these are just opinions I dont really have any criticism for the guide itself. Of course it could be a bit more visually appealing but the information has been ordered and presented well enough for a dumbass like me to understand. Thanks for your effort the Lulu mains and I appreciate it.,lulumains,ddlhs2h,2,t5_35l0h

11723945,0,t1_dgox1lf,Yeah I agree but I dont really see how else they could nerf her. They cant nerf her Q because thats not entirely the issue and also its not exactly fantastic currently. They cant nerf her W excessively because they had to bring in the AS increase to compensate for halving the MS increase. They could nerf the base values on her E but they shouldnt nerf the durations because theyve already been hit before and tbh theres nothing wrong with them. Only things they could do would be to her ult and the only things they should do would be the base health increase being reduced or nerfingremoving the AOE slow. Beyond those things and the passive scaling theres not much that can really be done.,lulumains,dgoxtxd,1,t5_35l0h
