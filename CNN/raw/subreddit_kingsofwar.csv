4517051,0,t1_ct00grq,Yeah I get to keep my cannons and mortars. But I loose steam tanks buff wagons and demigryphs. I built an army yesterday trying to at least stay close to what I already owned. I ended up with something like  hordes. So without unit fillers I would need something like  more figures than I currently own. Right now I am doing my modeling and painting in Bolt Action. So I am trying to make this swap as easy as possible.,kingsofwar,ct00nzz,2,t5_2s4bl
4529236,0,t1_ct1je43,All true in theory   Doing all that at the one time is a handfull.  In addition to Height  the Lancers also have Nimble  they can do two  degree pivots during a charge instead of one.  That gets you into some sneaky sneaky places.  The Abbess on a Panther needs a much smaller hole to fit through too.  Wont flank due to Individual but does triple attacks against war machines.  Nimble gets scarier the more Mv it has.  ,kingsofwar,ct1jnz3,1,t5_2s4bl

7022490,0,t3_4bnvty,Hey Armadagames great stuff. One suggestion to consider  lately I default to Ironheart Artisans because in addition to quality and service they include a leaderpoint notch on their tray the flat ones. Its a nice touch....,kingsofwar,d1ccmth,1,t5_2s4bl

7732202,0,t1_d3ixomi,Yeah and the amount of higher Def units will help mitigate elf bowmen. My only concern is that surge is tricky for absolute newbies to get. If you explain to them how to use surge ie to get flank charges not just overextend one unit moving forward it should be a great introduction to the game. ,kingsofwar,d3l3hka,2,t5_2s4bl
9819038,0,t1_dancmx2,I was pretty happy with mine. I got a set of Dwarf Brock riders to add to my army. The rest was some choas like units and some skeletons.,kingsofwar,danftmz,2,t5_2s4bl
9823015,0,t3_5fw6yz,Facebook has a Kings of War Fanatics Group Its pretty much the reason Im on facebook.Their official forums are good too. The main discussion is active but the army subforums arent especially. If you ask for advice though youll get it I dabbled in AD and one of my main opponents is currently working through their list also.We all think they are very strong. great units to Horde up Golems and Grotesques. I think Golems are a little stronger but they need some support. Having a caster nearby to heal up a high nerve de unit is pretty nasty.They have very good characters too their casters for golems and halfbreed champs for everything else. They hit so damn hard and as Individuals they can hit in any direction. Plus they can stick around longer than they should with a few good regen saves.I think taking  units of gargoyles for chaff is important they can harass any shooting your opponents may have.Those are the standout options to me. Proxy and play some games figure out what you like. Great army to choose.,kingsofwar,danyj83,2,t5_2s4bl
10505259,0,t1_dcymcvs,Do you think Gargoyles and their Vicious are more useful or Harpies with Pathfinder for the role you use yours in?,kingsofwar,dcyvsc5,2,t5_2s4bl
