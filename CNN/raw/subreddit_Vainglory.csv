2424182,0,t1_cmayeo9,Thats brutal that a phone call would kick you from the game and not let you reconnect. Ill start going to airplane mode with wifi enabled before I play or face the truth that I have no friends so no one will call me. Thanks for the heads up. I still feel really out of my element in the jungle. Ive played Petal every game except one when I tried AD adagio or we that guys name is so I feel most at home in lane. ,Vainglory,cmbc4r6,5,t5_2sgdz

6455932,0,t3_4435u7,Yeah I got it too. I really hope they fix it. Does anyone think they may change the ranked system to the old type? I just checked the ratings of the game and there were tons of  star reviews backlashing against the new changes.,Vainglory,czn3416,1,t5_2sgdz

6527628,0,t1_cxx9lls,No on the PC it is harder to cast abilities and you still have to click the ability and then click the enemy you wish to cast it on so it is all fair game. No banable offense using the computer unless you are using other programs to macro things ,Vainglory,czuibrv,0,t5_2sgdz
6770452,0,t3_48i4mk,Usually when you gank mid people will stay for a bit to try and gank the support that comes up to guard the lane while the laner is dead. Ive never met people who just stay in the lane after they gank for the rest of the match,Vainglory,d0jpmv9,1,t5_2sgdz
