9589412,0,t3_5c2het,You said you might want it RG what about this?Each of these planeswalkers makes creature tokens except chandra who is only really there because you can get her for  and she draws cards. Every token made is also green which means Freyalises ulti can get crazy. Xenagos can give you tons of mana to pay for things like Overrun and other walkers. His ulti wont be used often but it can flood you with lands so that Nissas ulti does something. ,Super_Budget_MTG,d9v3a6k,2,t5_2z1nh
