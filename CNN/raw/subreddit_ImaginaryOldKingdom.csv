3145366,0,t1_coo0hca,I see! I thought having the artists name was enough but I understand the need to link back to the artist. I just had a momentary panic that Id have to go through and delete all my recent posts P. Thanks for the heads up! Ill add in sources to ones Ive missed in the morning.,ImaginaryOldKingdom,coo0ik3,2,t5_30bcl
