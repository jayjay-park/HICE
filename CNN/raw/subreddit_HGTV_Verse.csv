3842972,0,t1_cqt7e0k,I often wonder about that... How much latitude people who actually understand what shows are doing or should be doing are willing to give. It must be so much harder to suspend disbelief in that case.Thankfully my job I teach international students in their foundation year before undergradpostgrad study means I dont encounter that too much though I did really enjoy an online corporate training course I had to do recently because it included BS references to psychological studies my undergrad degree is in Psychology to lend it credence. I alternated between fury at the incompetence and all out laughing for the hour or so it took.,HGTV_Verse,cqubzg5,1,t5_37y87
3868077,0,t1_cqx5jm3,My dad always makes his with butterflavored crisco and swears by it  Im generally anti margarinesimilar products but his crust is very good.  I am a decent cook although Ive been in a take outsnackylazy rut lately but I dont bake because I cant be bothered to measure anything.  I cook in a very haphazard way in which I glance at recipes if its something I havent done before but then I just throw in whatever I think would improve it.  Things that I always think would improve every dish butter onions garlic booze cheese.,HGTV_Verse,cqx709e,1,t5_37y87
