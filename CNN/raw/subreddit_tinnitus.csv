1725800,0,t1_cjv9xk6,Goddamn it. Its been  weeks now. And its definitely just as loud today as it was the day after the concert. Fuck. Its not going away is it? I cant stand the idea that I let something so fragile and important to me not to mention literally a physical part of me just get thrashed for two hours so hard that now its permanently damaged. It just makes me feel like shit. I want to producemix music thats my biggest passion. Now I feel like the very window that I need to look through to do that has a little bit of shit smeared on it that I can never get off. It used to be pristine and transparent. I feel like Im a little more removed from the music now when I listen like I cant fully immerse myself in it like I used to be able to. I think I may have slightly damaged my hearing of high frequencies at that concert along with developing tinnitus.Whenever I wake up and hear that loud high pitched squeal in my left ear it almost feels like someone is taking a power saw to a piece of metal and that noise is right in  my ear and I cant ever get away from it. I hate this so much. I know Ill get used to it but fuck does it suck to have something that I care about so much become permanently thrashed.

I could never imagine that.I also think that a lot of people have tinnitus but dont care about it.  Something like  of the American population have tinnitus to some degree.  Its hard to get an exact figure but its somewhere in the  million people neighborhood.Of the  million its estimated  million have it so bad to seek medical help and of those there are approximately  million people who cant function with it.Its a sliding scale and fortunately for most people they are on the side where it isnt bothersome.  I used to be on that side of the scale and I think thats the issue with tinnitus.It isnt cancer it isnt life threatening its not going to kill you but it can ruin your life.  A lot of people who have it are in the it doesnt bother me category and will tell you just to deal with it without realizing that it can be much worse for others.So yes there isnt enough public knowledge on it and the vast majority of people who have it have no issue so... yeah... its a troubling combination.,tinnitus,ckc91yo,2,t5_2saf4

3031990,0,t3_2uwahp,It might it might not. Mine was stable for a decade plus until a combination of ludicrously loud noise and emotional trauma.I really think that the feel good bullshit lifestyle suggestions diet exercise relaxation etc that a lot of people make might actually be important to prevent a progression of the symptom at least in cases where emotional volatility is a significant factor in the amount of distress one is experiencing.Put more simply to the extent that tinnitus is a symptom of underlaying anxietystress things that make that anxiety less of a factor in your life might also prevent the tinnitus from getting worse and things that make anxiety worse might also make the tinnitus worse by literally wiring your brain to send the signal more strongly. Plenty of us have had the experience of our tinnitus becoming alarmingly louder in a moment of severe acute stress  it seems reasonable to suspect a similar connection between chronic stress and a chronic increase.So that I dont paint with too wide a brush Id say its important to remember that tinnitus is a symptom or even a group of similar symptoms which may have different causes. Ive had significant problems with panic and anxiety for much longer than Ive had tinnitus and my tinnitus is experienced in that context. People who have never had a panic attack then shoot a handgun with no earplugs on and develop a chronic ring dont really have the same condition that I do even though the symptom is the same and even though those people might go through a period of severe stress or panic as a result of the audio trauma.,tinnitus,coc9i66,3,t5_2saf4

Switched back and forth several times to confirm. My left ear sounded garbled quieter and made the persons voice slightly deeper.

There may be microvibrations of the eardrum that you need a tympanometry to detect.But the voice sounding louder than normal could just be you noticing it in when I draw attention to it like if I say to be aware of your breathing you become aware of it.

A consert ballgame the gym movies or even driving the on the highway for prolonged periods of time can accumulate noise stress to your hearing that will result in a louder tinnitus and further loss of hearing.Read up on the subject plan a head for all noisy situations and allways protect your hearing when needed.This is just my bit coming with  years of experience with tinnitus.,tinnitus,db6scy0,2,t5_2saf4

10951735,0,t1_dc7tnfe,Sorry but by headphones do you mean earbudthe dudes that go inside your ears? I have the bose qc s and they defiantly dont make my tinnitus as bad as the ear budsims. When my ENT doc said headphones are much better than ear buds.Both still increase the prominence of my tinnitus but the bose headphones make it much more manageable.,tinnitus,de9ldu7,1,t5_2saf4

11233885,0,t3_609yc5,It made my tinnitus calmer.I had a super intense smoking session with two of my buddies and we decided to smoke like  grams in a night cuz I was leaving the country for a long while!So we smoked up a shit ton and at one point I had this sort of beeping in my ear that it went from high to low and gradually just went silent.It was like how a ping pong ball falls on the floor and and until it was not bouncing it was getting lower and lower in terms of pitch. And then it was gone!Really weird and awesome experience. But I still have my T comes and goes. Gets really weird on alcohol. Hope we fuckin find a solution for this shit.,tinnitus,df5cg8a,1,t5_2saf4

11295434,0,t3_616u30,This is so weird because the exact same thing is currently happening to me. About  days ago I read the LPT and  nights ago as I was trying to sleep I realised it was there. I also figured its just from clubs and concerts and that Im completely fucked and Ive been a little depressed the last couple days. But this post has given me hope so thank you.Im currently preparing to take my A level exams in June in the UK these basically decide whether you get into university or not but like yourself I didnt think this was bothering me. Ive been described once or twice in my life by people as the most laid back guy Ive ever met and have for the most part considered myself immune to stress. Of course the rational side of me knows that must be bullshit.Hopefully when July rolls around and I roll up my first J in  months I can find some peace and quiet again. Thanks for the post.,tinnitus,dfcbkgo,5,t5_2saf4

11450399,0,t3_63gaai,Honestly there have been few studies on it that found no correlation between accupuncture sessions and curing of T.However accupuncture can be strong placebo and placebo effect is a real thing. In case of those two friends chances are pretty good that the result was either coincidental or that placebo effect had such a result that they managed to habituate. Or least but not last its possible that their T was anxietystress related and accupuncture succeeded in decreasing their stress levels hence removing the symptom  tinnitus that is always a symptom of something.,tinnitus,dftw6bs,1,t5_2saf4
11454378,0,t1_dfubzlk,Also stay away from tinnitus forums. I know thats what this subreddit is but the best way to stop panicking is to not read about how other people are depressed.  If that makes sense,tinnitus,dfucfzb,2,t5_2saf4

11634971,0,t1_dgcwfia,Holy crap I have a very similar situation to that. I never realized I had tinnitus until my dumb teen years decided to search what that word meant how I wish i could rewind time for that. It clicked to me like a sudden realization and I couldnt ignore it afterwards. I have a hard time ignoring mine when am trying to sleepor left in a quiet environment. What I found that helps me sleep is controlling my breathingmeditation?. I just focus on getting a calm breathing pattern. It does not lessen it but it makes me fall asleep faster.,tinnitus,dgeu4sg,1,t5_2saf4
11801150,0,t1_dgxmdym,gt I had ruined any fun we couldve been having.Honestly thats sad to hear. Your parents dont sound very understanding.I know what you mean about the guilt. I didnt use good enough ear plugs when shooting guns got tinnitus luckily my tinnitus went away. Only to be brought back by an accident I had with my ear bud volume now Im  months in. Like you Ive had it since November.As you mention you seem like a person with lots of anxiety and stress. Tinnitus has a way of making the problems that already exist in your life worse. Its really hard but you have to overcome your anxieties and get stronger or anxiety will beat you down forever. Everyone here understands that and many of us are proof its possible.Anxiety will make your tinnitus worse getting over it will do wonders for you.,tinnitus,dgxp976,6,t5_2saf4
11802346,0,t3_68cz0t,Ive had tinnitus for nearly the same amount of time. There are better days and worse days but pretty soon you will learn what sounds are alright and what sounds you should protect yourself from. My ENT just said If the music is loud enough where someone right in front of you has to shout for you to understand them its too loud. That said I generally protect my ears for parties and sirens. With sirens I use my fingers to cover my ears. I have a sound level measuring app so with music I wear earplugs if its above db. Some days I get paranoid about certain noises being too loud but Ive learned to curb that feeling to the situations where its appropriate. Im a little high right now so Im sorry if this post is disjointed but I just wanted to share how I manage my T incase it could help you.,tinnitus,dgxu508,2,t5_2saf4
11802750,0,t3_68eir5,First thing you do is go to an ENT and tell them you have ringing in your ears. While there you should get an answer as to what the problem is and if theres a solution.If there isnt a solution worst case youve got it for a long time maybe forever. Youre not the first. People cope with it in different ways.Mine is due to hearing loss at a specific frequency. I can still listen to music using over ear headphones NOT ear buds play games everything I did before minus going to concerts. The worst thing that has happened is I have to sleep with white noise playing. Thats really it.Think about this problem logically. If it is irreversible then start coping with it now. Dont let it impact your studies. If the ENT okays you to listen to music with headphones study while listening to music or the sound of rain.You feel like you cant enjoy your life anymore? Dont let tinnitus ruin your life. This is why its so important to see an ENT. Get answers start fixing the problem or coping with the problem. Sure its easier for me to type that than dealing with it but life goes on. Its not the end of the world by any means.,tinnitus,dgxvsdr,2,t5_2saf4
