10802033,0,t3_5u9zf9,There are a few goals as of yetGet to the corruption layer and get lumite equipment.  Unlock all the recipes And the fundamental goal the developers are pushing towards creativity. I know you said you wanted goals other than making your own fun but thats really a huge part of games like this. Someone also mentioned adventures... Those will allow for playercreated maps similar to custom maps in minecraft so once those come out it will add some more fun stuff to do. ,Creativerse,ddu5j67,1,t5_337pj
