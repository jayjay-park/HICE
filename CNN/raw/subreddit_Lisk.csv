7851650,0,t3_4mvb4j,It would be considered safer since you arent relying on trusting someone elses node.  The official Lisk nodes should be considered safe though and its much easierquicker.You can find the instructions for installing the client here ,Lisk,d3ylg6a,1,t5_3bqj4
7881251,0,t1_d41xah4,I never said I didnt make mistakes but lets be clear here they spent  million dollars in a single year after I left and then scattered to form their own companies. Your information is biased and wrong about my departure and Im not an erratic person. The hundreds of people who have worked with me in this industry will testify to that and I am currently running a company with a larger team than Ethereum. ,Lisk,d41xcmf,4,t5_3bqj4

8357468,0,t1_d5loqw8,I do not argue. But the man was asked about Lisk instead about the fact on what you can do. If a person in the thread about the Ethereum asked about the creation of a torrent on it and I would have got to realize this is a clause on Lisk did was right?The question is not to what sounded existing crypto projects can make a torrent.

10738109,0,t3_5tlc9d,Hey ucoinerminer I believe we discussed briefly about what your project was over P.M. and it entails you creating a coin on the Lisk sidechain that can be used on IOT devices as payment for special services. That is a great project and as you stated you see that Lisks esteem would surely help your platforms success. I believe this to be true.I want to help the clarify best I can the reasons you listed about Lisk that bugged you. I can understand why you can say this but one thing that we need to also consider is that every cryptography blockchain is in its infancy stages. This includes Bitcoin and this is why the Lisk team works hard every day to work towards a constant better platform to provide to its users and developers. Check here This again can correlate to my first answer. Every day as we develop we work towards these areas that are so very important to us in order to provide again a better platform to its users and developers. Check here This may be the case in some way but that is because this is a very sensitive development part in the Lisk project and it needs to be made sure that its done properly the first time instead of being rushed for release and running into issues later.  This isnt the case. It isnt impossible. We do have a SDK its just inconvenient and isnt feasible and this is why we are creating a much more advance SDK that everyone will be grateful for. This also isnt the case. The Lisk community includes many developers and most of these developers are planning and ready to develop and create ontop of the Lisk platform when the new SDK is complete. You can find them here. Some do and the ones who are serious try to contact our developers to get assistance to the others this is why we are building a new SDK that will be easy enough for any developer to fully customize their own project on the Lisk platform.Again maybe its a misunderstanding on your behalf of not knowing of the resources and channels to look into that could help give you confidence in the Lisk platform. But if you were to only momentarily look through either of these you would find the answers to your questions and concerns Lisk Github Lisk Chat,Lisk,ddnjzj6,1,t5_3bqj4
