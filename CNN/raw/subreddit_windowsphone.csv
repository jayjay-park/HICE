But when you resume there is a  second delay so you can see what was going on before you pressed the number. When you press your finger on the right joystick while being in delay the turret your robot will turn around without shooting bullets.

My parents have a pretty flaky router in their home. Half of the time its slower than my cell connection. When I go over and Im trying to check something in the browser there are times where its crawling at a snails pace despite showing strong signal. On iOS I swipe up from the bottom press the WiFi button and Im done  my WiFi is off and Im now quickly loading the page over my cell connection without ever leaving the browser. On WP I have to hit the home button wait for the slow animation scroll to the shortcut tile hit it and wait for the related setting screen to animate in finally flip the WiFi toggle then back out through multiple screen to return to the browser.

351413,0,t3_1y3yua,Let me tell you how I started out.First of all I began an Android user in  as I was hunting for my first smartphone. I chose the Motorola Atrix G dubbed The Worlds Fastest Smartphone. It did indeed have beefy specs when I picked it up for its time. GHz Tegra  Processor GB RAM qHD display etc.. One thing I was totally against was Windows Phone simply because it got a really bad rap on the internet.My mother was also on the hunt for a smartphone. When I returned home from school one day she said So I went to best buy to look at phones and I got this!  It was a Samsung Focus a phone with WP. I was angry without even knowing anything about the phone or the features it had I just knew it was bad since it was not Android. I held this mentality until I actually.. used the thing. When I used the Windows Phone device it immediately had something my high end superphone at its time did not provide.. smoothness and fluidity. On top it had neat features like starting your camera even I your display was off. The UI was modern clean and I was just attracted to the hip factor of it all. My Atrix did not have any of those attributes jealousy began to ensue.I never expressed my fondness of WP until after my mother returned her Samsung Focus for a Samsung Captivate since she had a defective unit. I was considering selling my Atrix but I could just no justify moving from a well specd Android device to a lesser Windows Phone device single core processors at the timeBy the time  came around my contract was up and I was totally done with Android. Motorola gave the cold shoulder to the ICS update on the Atrix and I was just eager to leave the platform as my Atrix was slower than molasses and I did not want another lag fest in another two years with whatever Android device was out at the time.While you could argue that Jellybean fixed the lag problem I would argue right back and say it did not. I do own a  Nexus  and KitKat ruined the performance of that thing. Back to the point. When my contact expired I chose the Lumia  and the WP platform and I do no regret it a year later. Ive never ever experienced lag performance issues or a cold shoulder for an update. The entire platform is totally rock solid Nokia provides a lot of added value with their mapping applications as well.The cons would have to be the negativity developers and the internet give Windows Phone. In reality it is a fantastic platform developers just dont give it the time of day.If people just held a Windows Phone and used it for a week I think they would enjoy their experience and consider it as a viable  platform for when their  year deal with the devil expires.,windowsphone,cfh6wj6,65,t5_2r71o

360059,0,t1_cfhynmd,Youre right its speculation. To me it felt like common sense but youre correct that the screenshot could mean anything. Seems like you really want it to mean a particular thing though.Heres what I think.  You can already open the navigation app with voice.  I imagine that though there are apps such as GMaps that dont actually have voice guidance or sometimes even real turn by turn that still register themselves as a navigation app the understood intent was that this was always for voice guided navigation apps such as Here Drive. That assumption on my part is why this screenshot doesnt represent anything new to me. Microsoft has precedent like the camera app of taking selectachoice screens and putting them in a default setting. The presence of the word voice here doesnt suggest anything to me but voiceguided which we already choose between. So to me its kind of obvious what this is.

616892,0,t3_21756q,tldr Regional markets are broken and I hope the cease to exist.  Welcome to the free global market. In times of global connectivity information about regional promotion will be shared and people will try to find a way to get stuff for free. This isnt something that only happens because of this app and it wont stop once the app doesnt work anymore. As an Austrian I hate regional markets because it means that I cant use many new services because they arent available here. Even if I paid. I had two Apple accounts one Austrian and one US because of that. And I know many people who did too. Not because it was easy we had to buy gift cards over eBay and similar things but the incentive of getting certain apps was bigger. As a heavy user Im using ways to get apps for free because while I spend more than most users I cant afford to buy everything. The app in question is rather complicated to use compared to other things. The Windows Phone ecosystem is too small but hopefully it will sometimes be represented on rapphookup or even start its own subreddit as a quality source for deals. In the end making an app free has the goal to raise awareness for an app.,windowsphone,cgae448,8,t5_2r71o

Mixradio is actually good at introducing you to music you might like. Windows phone central is a very nice app you can put in your start screen which tells you about new appsgamesupdates to keep you up to date. You could link multiple email inboxes its built in. Metro tube is the youtube app I decided was the best for the phone. Hold the camera button to go from lockedmode to takingpicture mode. Look into jetpack joyride BBBAppocalypse minicraft royal revolt  to get you started with good games in the system. Skype only accepts group calls if the host calls you you cant join a group call by yourself. Dont get too accustomed to your new start screen because update . will change the size of the tiles.

In Europe they made them make a separate distro for fairness fined them billions and made them follow insane rules about every MS product no media player or codecs installed by default. Even if IE had  market share and everyone was forced to use it other companies come out with alternatives since its bad for business. The EU did not have to step in. The US did not and we got by fine. I know its not a popular opinion in Europe but companies like Google and Apple are not going to let Microsoft get away with a monopoly. Thats why ever monopoly in history is unsustainable from Standard Oil to ATampT. Both of those companies had to USE government to prevent competition e.g. suing competitors with inane patents the free market was solving it already.While Europe is using government to fine the companies American companies like Google and Mozilla got their shit together and actually made competitors. When Office got  market share Google Docs was created and is gaining market share every day. It is no way ready for all businesses but it gains features every year all without the help of government protection.

Why did the Bing Maps product give me popups to set my region to a region that didnt exist?Why did Microsoft not provide help or support information on the topic?It is an oversight which shows a lack of care.  I am not even sure what the application region actually even does but the searches that kept returning overseas towns instead of local ones were annoying.Why cant Microsoft just provide a better worded popup message if a person puts their home in a nonsupported application region?  How hard was that to implement?Does it take years of testing and research to provide a better message other than telling you to set an application region that does not exist?As far as I know I pay the same for Microsoft functionality as people in the US and the applications that keep referring back to American languages etc and I say etc because why is US letter even a default paper size after I chose my country when I initially started the device.  If you are not American then it is a nonstop battle with settings.  Getting my first . device and getting those Bing messages just told me that nothing has changed.I like Microsoft products but the regional settings have always been poor.  Settings are in multiple places and they reset to US defaults for multiple reasons.  You can say this is down to beta testing but it has been like this for Windows and Office forever.End of rant ,windowsphone,cgsu907,4,t5_2r71o

837151,0,t3_23pjmw,For anyone wondering how this works. Modern phone batteries contain microprocessors that help with measuring the amount of battery remaining. The battery does this since if you run a lithium battery to dead flat they dont charge again. So the battery tells your phone that its flat before it runs out. Im not exactly sure which side ends up with the issue but essentially your phone has forgotten how big the battery is. Instead of using the usual lets say  the phone might think the battery is only half that size so says its flat at . Now to fix it you have to recalibrate the battery by running it flat and then charging it for at least ten hours. When its fully charged the phone will stop drawing power and wont overcharge the battery but some trickle charging occurs. This will help make sure the battery is fully charged. By running it down again the battery I relearning how big it is. This is typically suggested to be done three times in a row. Edit It can also be used to rejuvenate old lithium batteries as a slight battery memory effect happens over time.

933626,0,t3_24ryop,While I am  in support of an encrypted messaging solution on Windows Phone I think forking TextSecure would be a better idea because it offers two methods for data encryptionhandling. One is point to point where you and your friend stand next to each other to share and trust each others key and then you can begin texting on an encrypted channel. In this setup the text is sent via SMS but is encrypted in such a way that only your friend can read it. No server or service is required and as such no one else has access to the keys. The downside is that if you lose your key wipe your phone new phone etc. you have no way of recovering those texts which isnt typically important to people who value privacy anyhow.The second method TextSecure offers is via a service you run on a service you host which enables the TextSecure app to send your message via the data channel instead of SMS. This has the advantage of working anywhere you can get a data signal mobile or WiFi and also of bypassing your wireless carriers SMS servers. In a scenario where you and your friend are connected via the TextSecure hosted service and youre both on WiFi connections your wireless carrier never even sees the encrypted conversation. Your ISPs however would see them but again they are encrypted so there is some level of protection there. The big advantage here is that you actually control the server that brokers the secure connection not your carrier or your ISP and you also dont need a wireless plan to use this method so long as you have WiFi. The advantage of controlling the server is that your data cant be swept up by the NSA in some overly broad data request. The other advantage is that the server negotiates the key exchange so there is no need for you to first establish trust in person though I would say this is really the best way to do this in general it just isnt practical in many cases.TextSecure is opensource and hosted on GitHub In my spare time Im looking at the Android version and trying to make a Windows Phone port but Im pretty novice at Java and only a little better at C so its slow going as I learn the codebase.

1097005,0,t3_26lfcl,  Photosynth needs a couple of minor features added to it. For one it would be awesome to be able to change the resolution even if that means stitching can only happen server side. Also access to the original prestitched images would be great for correcting mistakes because Photosynth is not perfect.  The official Kindle app cant keep the screen on so its pretty much useless to me.   Point Reader is the only word flashing app on WP and it does not work. It can only load books through OneDrive and it times out every time so Ive never been able to get it working. I REALLY want an update for that one. An argument against updates I used to use a music player for the car called Gesture Music Player which transformed the cover art for whatever track you were listening to into a spinning disc. It was Beautiful. In the latest update they scrapped this and replaced it with a horrible stretched image of the cover art with illegible text overlayed. The back button exits the app instead of going back to the last screen you were on music selection and the gestures are not configurable. And theyve added a prompt to rate the app which comes up on every screen and is infuriating. Theyve ruined the app. OK its not really an argument against updates as such. There should still be updates. It just blows my mind that someone could screw up an app so badly with an update killing the best features like that. ,windowsphone,chszfhw,2,t5_2r71o

The restriction for a  minute live tile update is admittedly artificial but theres a strong rationale for it.  Battery drain.  MS is limiting rd parties from unintentionally causing phones to drain the battery.  Its also a performance issue.  Background tasks use processor power.  MS is trying to make the WP platform as responsive as possible for low  hardware.

Fact is Ive tried Windows Phone and while its a great OS there are too many factors that keep it from being my daily driver. Yet some people here not naming names you know who you are insist that because I dont main Windows phone I am an asshole and am unfit for even being here. That attitude is sickening. I will admit first and foremost I am NOT a good mod. Not even close. But the correlation people make saying that Im a bad mod because I dont main a Windows Phone... I mean seriously? The fanboyism here when it gets out of hand makes me lose my faith in humanity. If Windows Phone works for you Im glad you like it and I hope you enjoy it.

With everything except the iPhone its always been the case that you get an update or two usually one of them is a minor maintenance update and then thats it.       Even with phones that are on multiple carriers Verizon will get two updates while others get many more. Then after a year of asking why there is no support they will blame the manufacturer.

1608573,0,t1_cjhv0ki,There have been plenty of concepts like this. The problem with all of them is the problem that a lot of concepts bump into Its very easy to design something pretty if you dont pay attention to practical considerations. And even if something is technically possible that doesnt mean its applicable on a big enough scale or economically viable or that its possible in the express context of the rest of the concept.The reason most actually developed smartwatches end up looking like kids toys is because thats what they end up being if you attach a square touchscreen to a big battery. And then you need some extra room for the buttons and for the io port and for SoC and for the bluetooth antennas. And then you somehow have to have third party software developed for the new form factor.Round touchscreens are expensive and rare. Thin batteries have limitations. Perfectly seamless curved metal turns out not to be the most ideal antenna conditions etc. etc.Theres countless concepts with pretty d renders of beautiful watches.

1639094,0,t1_cjlreem,Well the phone might be damaged or malfunctioning. You need to check your typing as you type and then you can fix any errors as you make them. You might just need to adjust to the phones keyboard.    About the cursor you can still highlight text and move the cursor when typing it just works differently than in .. Tap any word to highlight it or copy it. Tap to the right of your text to bring up the cursor and then tap and drag the bottom circle on the cursor to move it around your text.    New tabs always open in the foreground on any phone AFAIK as theyre not really meant to handle more than one window at a time.    Try to see whats taking up space on your phone. If its just the phones OS you can put in an SD card to add storage or factory reset your phone to start fresh with more storage.     I would encourage that you see Microsofts videos explaining Cortana on their youtube channel it seems that you dont really understand what it does and what it doesnt do.      I dont understand your question about tabs but I can have more than  tabs open on my  and history seems to work well.  You might have a problem phone seeing as youre having problems typing and you cant use the cursor properly. Try a factory reset and see what it does for ya. In all this keep in mind that this is now a sub phone and you cant expect it to behave like a  phone.,windowsphone,cjlrty8,2,t5_2r71o

I actually prefer a smaller screen so I can do a majority of tasks onehanded.Overall the higherend phones are really only for people who use their phones for everything socially or businesswise or something else.

Completely stock that information is on the Lock Screen.gt Need to check the weather forecast for a few days to see if I should wait to paint the fence something I did a few days ago? Live Tile says it will be sunny and warm all week.I have a widget that does just that.  It isnt fair to pick and choose what parts of the UI you can and cannot compare against if its all a part of the native experience.gt In addition to that the Live Tiles allow you to use your entire screenYoure preaching to the choir bud.

Featurewise the Lumia has the far better camera but HTC has better specs otherwise and includes an IR blaster which I will use a lot.

Google is primarily a services company but I think they see Android as their chance to be a s era MS.  Theyre trying to kill AOSP.  Once they have a monopoly in mobile OS everyone will be even more plugged into their ecosystem than they are now.       Apple isnt really a threat as far as services go.

2538385,0,t1_cmpvmay,Right but you cant just sandbox a portion of your start screen. If you have live tiles that extend below your screen height they are still moving and updating you just cant see them but they are still using just as many resources so that when you scroll down they dont have to start or initialize their livetile behavior. Also when you swipe left to enter the app drawer it does not sandbox the main start screen and turn the live tiles off. They continue updating just as if you were still on the main start screen. Try swiping slowly to the left and youll see that the app drawer is really just a horizontal extension to the start screen and not a sandboxed or graveyarded app. Think of it more like a pivot page. Everything continues to chug along on all pivot pages regardless of which one is currently displayed on the screen.The same concept would apply to the music app. You cannot have a swiperight for music functionality unless the music app was constantly up and running. And that might work fine with no music playing and no animations firing but the second you start up a playlist and its trying to update the scrub bar and the songs list and the artist background and all of its other processes your start screen is going to become a jittery mess. Theres no way you can simply sandbox something like that. Otherwise swiping right would be messy and slow. You would swipe right and you would basically see the app launching animation with the splash screen and then the menus would load and then it would just be as slow as it is now and it would defeat the purpose of having it as a start screen swipe extension. ,windowsphone,cmpwil9,-1,t5_2r71o

As I said the major reason they arent included now is that I had no idea they were available to be implemented as I couldnt find any information on that when working on the game.  We have achievements and leaderboards on the other platforms so implementing them for WP should be mostly trivial.  Ill research more on that.edit  Looks like they indeed arent available to be implemented unless your game is published by Microsoft Studios  not much we can do about that at this point.gt Currently Xbox Live on Windows is only available to developers working with Microsoft Studios or other publishing partners. There is not a freely distributed SDK or service available unless you are working with Microsoft Studios or another of the Live publishing partners.source  |  more info,windowsphone,cmqzdqn,1,t5_2r71o

2549326,0,t1_cmrb6kd,Yeah I understand the annoyance that it should be on the first page and completely agree.  However I think your correction of useless is a lot better of a term to use than fake since most are just guides or cheap knockoffs but still legitimate apps that are not misleading.  Its a fine line to walk because with the smaller market share WP has to look to third parties more to provide apps for things such as Youtube but still want to make sure to not have completely misleading apps. So you end up setting the bar somewhere between allowing for well polished third party Youtube apps as well as crappy game knockoffs as long as they arent directly misleading. ,windowsphone,cmrc1f1,2,t5_2r71o

Perhaps well see more of that type of thing in the future where the same hardware is running Android on one variant and WP on another? It would be a lesser risk for manufacturers than designing WP handsets from the ground up and it would get more WP options out there.

2749864,0,t1_cngln4z,gt If youre really a  year veteran you should know that the triad model is relatively new and is something Sinofsky brought to Windows after it was successful in Office. Before that the PUM model was standard across most of the company.That depends on what you mean.  By triad I just mean the separation of roles between Dev Test and PM up through some common manager.  In most teams thats a PUM or a GM depending on the size.  Windows and Office used a different reporting structure and yes Sinofsky changed that structure when he came over to Windows.  In some ways his changes were healthy but his stubbon refusal to take criticism was not healthy.gt During Windows  Steven ran the WEX division and basically saved Windows after the Vista clusterfuck.Good then he deserves praise for that.gt During that time COSD remained on the old management model and had a dev running things. And what happened? COSD was an abysmal failure that release and had to reset their biggest efforts and scrap most of them due to poor planning remember write aggregation? unified networking?.I wasnt in Win org during that time so I didnt see this part up close.gt Just compare the things Core OS got done in Win under Steven versus Win under Jon. ARM SOC power boot times modern boot UX through a very successful partnership with UEX! lots of great scalability work and so on.Yes and these are all good things.  But they only barely barely counterbalance the damage done to the Windows brand and to Microsofts position in the marketplace by the disastrous Win reception.  And yes all of that goes on Sinofskys head.  SLT certainly thought so which is why he was forced out when it was clear that customers hated Win.  He made it clear that Win was his baby and that everyone needed to STFU.  And when it turned out to be an ugly baby he was rightly the man to blame.gt And Im damn glad you arent running things there or theyd be doomed to another LonghornVista debacle. Oooo an ad hominem attack!  Surprisingly this is the first such ad hominem attack in this entire thread.  How sad that it comes from another softie.  It certainly adds to your credibility too.gt Despite its issues and reputation Win was a massive step forward for the technology and platform and accomplished on schedule in a relatively short period of time.Imagine how much stronger MSFTs market position would be now if Win had been welcomed by customers.  Surface RT was a total flop because apps.  Surface Pro  is finally getting some traction and love and that has everything to do with being able to tap into Win apps not RTStore apps.A lot of customers have finally understood that Win contains some great technology and theyve worked around the ugly and difficulttouse interface using Classic Shell or Start or other such things.  Win . slightly improved things.  Win is an obvious aboutface and its existence and the welcome reception its getting so far is more evidence that Win was a design failure.  Not an implementation failure but a design failure.  Everything that is wrong with Win was an obvious intentional design choice and all of that falls on Sinofsky.  The man who wanted to be the next turtlenecked OS designer.gt You got a lot of other things wrong too which make me doubt your story. Devs on Windows Server never had trouble getting access to the Windows source code autogroup issues notwithstanding. Thats just ludicrous and I have no idea where you got that.Where did I get that?  I experienced it.  I have nothing to prove to you  I have my own experiences and memories to draw on.  The teams I worked with in Win Server literally could not get access to important parts of Windows because of Sinofskys paranoia about leaks.  Before Sinofsky basically any FTE in the company could get access to Windows source code.I was basically told to fuck off when I requested access to one depot base.  Three years later with Sinofsky gone I finally have access to that depot again.  You know the same depot I had access to more than  years ago.gt And your claim that Steven prevented internal engineering groups from even talking is similarly ridiculous.You cant refute my actual experience.  I had longterm friends in other groups tell me that they would catch hell for even being seen talking to my team.  You cant tell me that happened because you werent in the room.gt Hell the partnership between Windows and DevDiv on Win platform and dev tooling was in my opinion one of the most successful examples of crossdivision cooperation I ever saw during my time there.Thats nice but what does that have to do with anything?  I never said a thing about Windows and DD collaboration.,windowsphone,cngnc59,5,t5_2r71o

The only thing of which I can think that is if your mouse gets too far I dunno maybe  pixels? horizontally from the scrollbar itll snap back to its original position then relock to your mouse when it goes back within the bounds.  But thats part of the Windows scrollbar so anything that uses that UI control Firefox Chrome Word... virtually anything will exhibit that behavior.  Im not noticing any unexpected or unpredictable actions.  Naturally the solution is to move to an interface without any notion of scrolling right? PWhich shortcuts broke?  All the ones I use  jump to letter cutcopypaste navigation pageupdown homeend  are still intact.For the standard pane a lot of it isnt really useful to me I agree.  Im guessing it made file management more accessible to people whose first instinct for getting more options isnt rightclicking or hitting up the the help command.  Views tab alone makes it worthwhile for me though.  It sucked having to dig through several layers of hidden menus to toggle visibility of hidden files and file extensions I eventually ended up using a script to bind WinH and WinY respectively but that was a bother to set up for every new machine I use every other week or so.  Contextspecific tabs are nice to have too since they separate the functionality out from the cluttered context menu.  Admitted the ribbontabs for music photo video and zipped folders are rather sparse but Ive used them on occasion.I guess the bottom line for my views on Fluentthe ribbon is that I havent experienced any regressions and see a good number of benefits for different types of users.,windowsphone,cntjlk6,1,t5_2r71o

2906378,0,t1_cnygc5a,Its not a chicken and egg issue because youre looking at the wrong issues. MS has no answer to the question Why should somebody leave iOS or Android for Windows Phone? Until it can answer that question it simply isnt going to gain users. And Because the UI is more similar to Android than you might have thought! is not the answer. Right now Because the UI is the bestdesigned on the market and its not even close is the best answer MS has and even that isnt enough.I think you are overestimating how difficult it is to switch to Windows Phone. The whole point of having such a brilliantlydesigned ecosystem is that the way it works becomes obvious and intuitive very quickly. In fact I would argue that by adopting Androidstyle design touches in a piecemeal way WP will become harder to understand than when the OS was entirely coherent. I find it really confusing to go from apps that are clearly designed with WP in mind e.g. Readit Music Metromail to apps that are crossplatform ports not designed by great WP developers Twitter FB.,windowsphone,cnygmwr,2,t5_2r71o

2980228,0,t1_co6us9p,You are wrong and I wil tell you why WP is fucking stagnating focusing on low end devices you cant have an entire OS focus on low end that is stupid. Low end devices may increase marketshare but you have to take smaller margins or take a loss low end devices mean less people paying for apps which means less big name apps come on board. Look at how many people bitched about Minecraft being . WP devices are being sold in large amounts by low end devices these kind of people who pay less than  for a phone are less likely to pay for apps. It is the reason why Android took so long to get big name devs on board no one would pay for apps because most of Android devices at the time  and earlier were low end. Low end and midrange focus is the exact reason why WP is doing so poorly now marketshare is down even though more devices are sold. Not to mention because mostly low end devices are sold apps such as banks dont see a reason to keep their app on the platform is most of the people using the OS either dont have an account with them dont use banks at all or use smaller cheaper banks or debit card services who wouldnt have an app anyway. Microsoft needs a high end device that wowed like the  and then the  when it first came out. Something that shows off WP the best and shows how good you can have it in Microsofts services. Low end devices can only shows that to an extent they wont run all the games people with low ends generally buy as little apps and games as possible and people with low ends may even use the WP device as their ONLY computing device so besides the phone with low margins or none at all they only use Microsoft services on the phone and wont be using Office on desktop or buying office  or buying Windows tablets and computers and workstations or buying a SP. That isnt profitable for anybody. That is why a high IS needed for Microsoft.,windowsphone,co6v8na,5,t5_2r71o

Their brain trust is so overwhelming they have been accused of brain drain  literally lowering the IQ of India and other nations by luring away their brightest engineers.  They have the planets most brilliant marketers on contract.  They have established relationships with everyone in technology.  They have every advantage imaginable.Despite exploiting every advantage to the fullest they have not managed to make their phone ecosystem popular with any one of retailers carriers consumers developers the press.  Therefore they do not know how to achieve that goal.  Changing the platform again is very  unlikely to solve the basic problem that they dont know how to get to where they want to be.

3065183,0,t1_cofngz8,Yes that is the primary redeeming feature of the AMOLED screen  the blacks are truly black which provides outstanding contrast.  But the downside is that they loose their brightnessvibrancy over time.  After  or  years they can begin to look washed out.  And they are also susceptible to screen burnin like a plasma TV.  You certainly do not want to leave a constant image or text screen lit up on them for a very long period of time.The IPS LCD screens like your s tend to have more accurate colors but less contrast.  So they tend to be less eye popping.  But they will look good for a longer period of time  certainly the viable lifespan of the device.BTW  the dark gray color of the blacks should only really be noticeable in a totally dark room.  In normally lit environments my  shows very black looking blacks.  If yours is different than you definitely have something out of whack.  Is your Brightness setting set to automatic?

Thats really my bad!   The websites search is above the list of tabs which are a vertical list on the left side of the page. Still my above rant is mostly correct that it makes no sense to float one button as far away as possible.

3129227,0,t3_2vzsc6,As someone who was on Android for  years then switched to WP here are some observations. The devices are nicer particularly with cameras. Cortana is amazing. the OS is smooth and optimizedAt first youll be blown away but after a couple weeks things got mirky for me. Heres what I missed. Google VoiceHangouts  the ability to text and call including video on any machine I log onto is priceless and very underrated. . Apps  dont let the WP fanboys tell you otherwise. Sure there are around  of the most popular apps available on WP then thats about it. For the rest youll be relying on rd party apps that NEVER get updated.. Media  I missed my Chromecast dearly. If you use one daily then dont make the switch. I tried mirroring my screen via Miracast but the experience is clunky and inefficient. . OS  WP at first seems great but multitasking is so awful its honestly one of the biggest reasons I went back to Android. WP doesnt have true multitasking apps often resume when you switch back to them and some dont even properly resumeclose at all  Spotify does this often I found.In addition YouTube Google Music and Chrome  all gone. The transition was jarring. Microsoft has great Office apps and OneDrive is nice but thats where it ends.I returned my  and went back to my Nexus . What most blind Microsoft fanboys wont ever realize is that in Google land your OS is the internet itself. You can keep up with communications and your datamedia on ANY device  well except for Windows Phones that is ,windowsphone,comcby6,2,t5_2r71o

3200406,0,t1_cotmnmf,I see no reason why Wallet couldnt operate the same way. Tap on a terminal and enter pin to accept transaction. The terminal can declare itself as a type of device that Microsoft would interpret as a Wallet compatible terminal. Theres already the option to put a pin on the Wallet even without locking your phone. Since Wallet is a baked in application all the prompts could easily be written to pop up over lock screen. Set up your cards through your Microsoft account and choose the card you want to use or default card for all purchases purchases by retailer etc.. I wouldnt be the least bit surprised if that story about Microsoft and PayPal getting a bit cozier last month isnt somehow related to all this!The only significant advantage Apple would have in this scenario is that they have TouchID versus entering a pin.

3213100,0,t1_cov0hmt,Its not so much that the date and time is correct now but rather when the issues happens  days from now a week from now whatever the photos are saved out of order. The correct date and time now doesnt necessarily reflect that it wasnt an issue then. Do you have .? If so the camera roll should be sorted chronologically by dates. The problem is when you are reviewing your photos the photo with most recent date is shown first. So if you take a photo on the th then a few days later on the th the phone reverts the date to the th when you go to review your pictures the last picture shown will be on the th because its in chronological order. The photo review doesnt go by last picture taken it goes by last date. Now if are certain that it didnt save to the camera roll i.e youve painstakingly nitpicked through every photo I would hook it up to a PC and see if there are any traces of any hidden files on your device. Connect the camera to your PC and unhide files and folders to see if the photos are being saved at all. ,windowsphone,cov1ek9,1,t5_2r71o

3264747,0,t1_coo0tiu,Marketing always comes up doesnt it?  If you think back to not too long ago youll have seen Microsoft pour buckets of cash into advertising Windows Phone.  And Surface Vista Bing Zune and a bunch of other failed products.  Marketing does not always work.Microsofts problem is being consistently late to the party.  If you let others come to market before you you either have to offer a significant amount of features or a significantly lower price.  Microsoft has done neither.  Thats why Windows Phone has failed.  Everyone is already using iOS or Android and Microsoft offers no compelling reason to change.  Isnt this super obvious?There are other reasons too.  Lots of people hate Microsoft including me.  Microsoft earned my hate this is not some irrational thing.  Ive been using computers since  and have used every major OS.  I ran and liked OS and even keep a NeXT Cube alive.  At home I run both OS X and Linux.  Ive had to run Windows at a number of jobs.  Ive lost hundreds maybe over a thousand hours to Windows.  Fuck up after fuck up after fuck up.  I have lost so much to Windows crashes.I can hear you already but newer versions of Windows are more stable!  Sure you are probably right and Im not going to argue.  But for me using Windows is like going back to the ex who used to beat the shit out of you.  Maybe theyve changed but my collective anger at Microsoft has not gone away.  No other computer platform has fucked me over so many times and in so many ways.  So fuck Microsoft.  They not only burned the bridge they threw acid in my face and insulted my mother while they were at it.  Thats why Microsoft is on my shit list along with Bank of America and United Airlines.  It would take a small miracle for me to use a Microsoft product again.  And Im not the only person who feels this way.,windowsphone,cp0ep4v,1,t5_2r71o

It doesnt know where jack shit is until the loader tells it where it is.This is where you substitute equivalent routines wrappers thunks whatever and how the whole scenario works.Hard coding through converting is stupid as it is not run time and thus can not take advantage of improvements or changes.

MS also owns this company making it extremely annoying and telling of where their properties lie.Next the Facebook app and the beta are pure garbage compared to Android and IOS. I know that MS has to make the app because not even Facebook will devote time to Windows phone right now but notifications are buggy as hell.  The group tile I have for school is useless.

Now considering the past history as you have mentioned it there could be a fair chance that one of these lenses could have been misplaced from their original position or worst case broken which is why it takes a heavens effort to focus appropriately. Sending the device back to Nokia or ATampT. I dont really know. Not American could be the only hope of regaining the original form.This is the most probable case that I could concur to.As far as the lag goes it runs in the family of s because of course old hardware. I run the Denim and the OS rarely lags but when it does it recovers in less than five seconds.

3716513,0,t1_cqfty70,Hello! These are all super common questions. But let me unpack some of your statements and dissect them a bit. Why not let the user swipe? Hamburger  bottom is better if you interact a lot Swiping sucks. It hides content. Lets say youre in Format and you want to get to something  tabs away. Five swipes is an unacceptable series of interactions. The carousel model has been disproven repeatedly every single decade for several decades. We have the data. Its a dumb interaction model full stop. It turns out bottom is not better. Youd think that something  pixels from your palm would be easier to reach than something in the middle of the phone. But nope. The way average people hold phones means the middle of the device is the best location. Both bottom and top require your hand to make a bit of a shift to reach. this is why swiping on items to get options like flag message or delete is popular. Make the gesture contextual to the item itself and you dont make people reach to use it. And this is again why reserving swipe at the app level for navigation is not a good model.b You dont use the hamburger very often. Most of your time is spent reading and then some of your time is spent manipulating the content. So if we put the hamburger on the bottom which no major app in the whole industry does then the app bar on the bottom would have to get larger in Office. And in the case of Outlook youd have to actually put a bar down there in the first place.c Once you have an app bar again in order to put the hamburger youll want to use that space. So maybe you put status down there. Maybe you put refresh. Maybe you put compose new. Well maybe you dont need the top bar anymore!d Except you do. So you know what folder youre in. and in other apps what document youre looking at or whatever So the choice is either Align with the rest of the industry by putting the bar on the top with some key actions and a hamburger or Put chrome on the top and bottom or Lose the titlebar at the top putting it at odds with every mobile OS on the planet.They chose correctly.,windowsphone,cqfwqdy,26,t5_2r71o
3719728,0,t1_cqg9bby,Okay since youre still answering Ill ask some follow up questions!. What happened to design for delight? Previews look far from it. Do you think theyre working on it?  .

3720114,0,t1_cqg3xo6,I dont get it. The app bar already has the separation of often used and rarely used actions. The commonly used actions are visible at all times near the bottom of the screen. They are typically few and very easy to reach.The notoften used ones are placed behing the triple dots on the same app bar. That clealry separates them from the commonly used actions yet still keeps them easy to reach and find.Is the action youre looking for not visible? Click the ... to see more actions is extremely intuitive. Having to look on the completely opposite side of the screen to find them is not.Note This opinion applies primarily to hamburgers in general not speciifcally to Office.,windowsphone,cqgbies,29,t5_2r71o

It doesnt support the AWS bands  Mhz in which TMo has traditionally served HSPA over the last few years.TMo is refarming though to transition its own  MHz band which the Icon supports from EDGE to LTE and from PCS from MetroPCS acquisition and its own to HSPA. Where this has been done youll get HSPA or LTE where not youll get EDGE for however many months it takes them to reach that location for refarm. Check the coverage map or do TMos test drive program for a temp phone to check coverage.Unlike the  it looks like the phone physically doesnt support AWS so no way to enable it in settings as is possible on ATampT .But yeah you should be able to just pop in the TMo SIM. Sometimes in such cases you need to input the carrier APN and MMS settings but ucompostablethrowaway can advise better on that or just search online.Theoretically the  should work similarly though people seem to have issues sending SMSes on TMo ,windowsphone,cqzt9s0,2,t5_2r71o

I think youre probably better off buying Pocket Casts even though its not feature complete right now. I wanted to like Podcast Critter since the dev seems like a cool frood but its just too unpolished and buggy to seriously consider IMO as a user.

3997346,0,t1_crbjgmu,That depends on which version on Android you are using.  Neither Googles Nexus version nor AOSP allow for customising quick toggles but WP does.  Im not sure about Samsungs Android version.Windows Phone lets you customise the alerts for every app that makes one.  You can change if it shows up in Action Centre the banner alert visibility the sound and if it vibrates all independently.  Thats not possible at all on Android.  Even with custom firmware the app has to code Notification editing into it to change sounds and vibrations.Windows Phone also lets you set a different image for the lock screen than for the wallpaper.  With Android Lollipop you cant set custom lock apps anymore.Windows Phone lets you set a theme across the entire OS.  I can choose light on dark or dark on light and a pervasive accent colour.  Thats impossible on most Android forks and there is no such thing as accent colour on Android.You can even turn on and off haptic feedback of the capacitive buttons and on devices with onscreen buttons you can change the colour of them.Windows Phone is extremely customisable.,windowsphone,crbxhhs,1,t5_2r71o

4135184,0,t3_381p7t, is true. Push notifications do suck. Now I dont know whether its the apps not being designed properly or the OSs fault but I had continuous problems with this. Kik was the worst offender here though I suspect its cause it wasnt designed properly. is also true. Even when WP. was updated to support tiles every minute I still couldnt have a clock tile on my Start Screen. Thered be times when itd just stop functioning. And I tested two seperate apps on this  still the same problem. I had to look in the right corner to corroborate that the time on the Start Screen was right which misses the point. The downloads thing is also annoying. I have to stay on the Maps app when I download maps? I cant let it download in the background? Im sorry thats just simply terrible.  Also true though I only ever used WP on a  mb device so maybe this is better on a  and  GB device. All I know is that on my device I could be waiting  seconds on that Resuming screen and still be dumped out of the place on the app I was in. That never happens on Android  no matter how long it takes I virtually never lose my place. Eh Im not sure this is a legit issue. The buttons did look off but Im not convinced its a major problem.

If they had them as they did in the dev betapreviewwhatever it was I dont think it wouldve been as bad. But no they had to hide it to the right which although I had no issue with that others did because it was absolutely nondiscoverable unless you knew about it.    Personally I like tiles on my desktop especially when I was able to keep a Start screen open in a separate screen which I cant do with Windows  and yes I submitted feedback some time ago. It provides a way for me to see notifications for apps I care about. I hardly use the action center on the PC.  As for the rest of your comment I agree.

Different apps have different performance because they are different app. Different apps use different technologies winRT apps can be written in TypeScript ccx c etc which all result in different performance. Same technologies also have different performance because apps have different layout. A ListView with a lot of imagestext field like a news app will not have the same performance as a list view with only text like a email client.

4618879,0,t1_ctc26p7,Its not just replacing the PC for offices.For a lot of people their phone is actually their main personal computing device their diary emails and other communications web browsing ticketbooking photo and video editing and sharing watching YouTube and Netflix listening to Spotify or iTunes Radio ... all done on their phone and usually in preference to the PC they may have sitting right there!They only have a PC because they need Word for writing their resume with a keyboard on a big screen or to connect to a printer so they can print out their concert tickets or whatever. These are things that phones have the power to do but until Continuum they havent had the capability.You can already use a Miracast adaptor to replicate your phone screen and sound onto any screen with HDMI. What Continuum and WM brings is  the ability for apps to detect this and flow into a more desktopfriendly UI  BT HID so you can FINALLY use a mouse and keyboard with your Windows phone  the builtin ability to print from your phone and  USBOTG so you can access that giant backup HDD or plug in a USB stick.With this the one device can cover all the computing needs of maybe  of users. Thats big big news.EDIT all of the above is for current devices like the . Newer flagships will be even better as they will be able to render the handset screen separate to the big screen. This means you could have a keyboard or mousepad on the small screen when casting Word to the big screen or you could cast a movie to the big screen while youre browsing IMDB on the small screen... so many possibilities!,windowsphone,ctcscgc,3,t5_2r71o

4670837,0,t1_ctja7zt,First they dont. Not extremely at least. The  only has USB TypeC Continuum and Iris scanning over the Moto X everything else is a push. The XL fares better but no carrier is rumored to pick it up so it has to compete off contract with Motos  ! price and the One Plus s  !!. Second the Lumia  was billed as the affordable flagship it was neither. Yet if it is going to retain that moniker it has to compete with the devices you naturally compared to Microsofts actual flagships. ,windowsphone,ctjb7c0,4,t5_2r71o

4681760,0,t3_3f29jt,Honestly and this sub is going to hate me for saying this as someone who just left windows phone I would avoid it as much as possible.  Even though MS says that it will integrate well with Windows  I would wait for reviews even though the OS launched today I would wait for reviews on how well it actually integrates.Now to you apps may not be that important but I would recommend that you look at which apps you use because even many major ones like Bank of America Snapchat venmo tindr and many other apps dont work on windows phone.  Yes there are rd party options like snap which is a rd party client for WP but they almost never work as well as the actual app itself does.  Also dont believe MS when they say that their porting software is going to make the app situation better they have been saying the app situation is getting better when it hasnt Ive been on WP and the windows  for phones beta made me want to get rid of it it was awful IMHO and not because it was a beta I know things arent supposed to work completely in a beta but everything like contacts email etc. Shouldnt be broken when its a beta.On top of it the edge browser after using it on my phone still couldnt render many websites correctly leaving them inoperable for me.Moreover after migrating to Android and my brother has an iPhone  I find that the Microsoft apps on those devices work better than on windows phone and they usually seem to get the updates first anyways!So my advice if you arent crazy about Android I think its fine for the most part even though its performance can sometimes be a little inconsistent is to go with an iPhone .  Or really wait until the ss come out because they should be out in a month or two.  I do like iOS better than Android I think its easier to use and runs better on top of having slightly more apps even though Android does get like  of the apps iPhone does.I used to be a huge windows phone fan but after Microsofts failed promises of the app situation getting better when it got worse and I was tired of constantly saying to my friends sorry I have a windows phone and cant get that app makes me really not want to recommend it. Its not even that the OS was bad just support for it was and because their marketshare is so small I dont foresee the vast majority of devs supporting them even with Windows .,windowsphone,ctkokm6,1,t5_2r71o

I was making coffee and waiting for it to cool down reading your post and I had a huge What in the world? This phone was ?! moment. The display is pretty damn good the camera is solid the battery life makes absolutely no sense I have screenshots getting like  days expandable storage a bump of  GB costs you  on an iPhone  for a  GB microSD among many other things. While the app thing is real Microsofts services are extremely enjoyable. Its really sad the internet circle jerks MSFT out to be some company stuck in the ss technology era that cant make good products UIs experiences etc. Ive been an Apple fan boy since I grew up in an Apple house on the iPodiPhone but let me tell you. Outlook OneDrive etc. are superior to the iOS variants imho and even if you dont believe that personallythere is no denying they are still great and extremely solid.The Microsoft made apps are awesome. I have a folder on my i called iOS Junk with  apps in it I never ever ever use. The apps loaded on my Windows Phone are either extremely useful or uninstallable. So yeah. Its a huge slap in the face and a sucker punch that this platform has existed for a good while just ignored by the masses its even a bit of a tragedy. Ill definitely be getting a OnePlus Two and a  with no regrets or no looking back.And I think with how awesome Windows  has been this will really help hook potential Windows Phone users oh and the Xbox One is getting backward compatibility and some sweet exclusives coming. Now on the topic of Windows Phone  I recommend it if you have a back up phone. I shortly used it for four days and it worked great for me considering it is months away from an official launch. Operations that are normally instant or very fast on WP . have a short pause on .

5018136,0,t1_cuqo2q0,I also owned a Focus as soon as it came out in Canada. Every smartphone Ive owned has been a WP! Woo!However Ive run out of reasons to recommend a WP to someone. MS has slowly downgraded their own software with new apps that lack features from the previous app but oh we can update it faster now. MS has also slowly been porting all of their great exclusive features to other OSs. Ive had this conversation frequently Why should I buy a Windows Phone? Well its got Cortana Xbox Music Xbox app Smartglass uhh.... Tiles? I like how it looks?Basically the only reason left for someone to buy a Windows Phone is the design but even thats going down the shitter.. Now MS is shoving hamburger menus in the hardest possible place to reach on the device WHY?! where we previously had very easy to reach and use elements like pivotspanoramas and the ellipses drawer thing. So now I cant even say I like the design because that was really only true a year or two ago. I guess Im only really here because I dont like Android  iOS?I mean dont get me wrong I love the improvements weve had but for years its been one step forward two steps back. Every other platform seems to be moving forward while WPMS for the past  or  years have been remaking and redeveloping their own features slowly losing features and pouring out shitty midrange phones.

Dont often use any other apps there isnt really anything I care about that isnt available on WP. Various thoughts iPod Touch is really a beautifully built and minimal device.  screen and .mm thick. iPod gets  days of battery life of fairly heavy use vs. lt day for phone. Wifi passwords dont sync from Windows devices to iPod Touch. iPod Touch doesnt have GPS so navigation in nonurban areas isnt very useful but geolocation with wifi is good in urban areas. Stock keyboard on iOS is shockingly bad and thirdparty keyboards dont integrate seamlessly. thgen iPod Touch is very slow. Safari is kind of dumpy but not really an issue for me since thgen iPod Touch is too slow to sensibly browse web anyway. Will order a thgen whenever they become available refurb since new iOS products are too expensive. OneNote and other MS productsservices syncing on iOS is good.,windowsphone,cutvvtv,5,t5_2r71o

5287859,0,t1_cvnkfbf,gtno just the truth. your one opinion is irrelevant to me.gtwhy you think this is hostility and you saying the same to me is not?Here is the difference you uninstalling chrome does not changes the fact  that chrome has  bigger market share that the windows store so while my opinion can be irrelevant to you is relevant to the discussion we are having about the chrome market share vs the win store market share. You posted thatyou uninstalled chrome as if it had an important repercussion to Chromes share i simply told you why it doesnt next you switched the focus of the conversation to opinions and by telling me my opinion is irrelevant you told me thateven though i posted sources you rather ignore it even if its based on facts. So here is why my point sustains while yours doesnt. Anything a mobile app facebook for examble can do you can also do it in a desktop by using a browser which does not necessarily has to be chrome i choose it for the conversation since is the most popular one that supports notifications which would be the only feature standalone facebook.com would lack. And you can ping any site you want in the taskbar for commodity.. Both desktop windows and mac already had stores yet mobile oriented developersbesides a few games did not bring their apps to the desktop.. Even if developers do choose to bring their apps to desktop they face a few issues  the windows store is not the only place where users can get their apps. Therefore they are not forced to use it. Besides most services can provide the same experience or even a better experience with a website youtube is a great example of this. . On the top of the former any appgame can be pirated in windows. This is out of discussion.. The fact that google chrome has an store and it has numbers near iOSwhich gets all apps yet you dont see apps like snapchat tinder facebook twitter instagram whatsappyou need to have a phone in other to use it therefore is not a true app until you can use it without a phone in the chrome store proves that the mobile developments have no interest in the desktop market. Hence the existence of Astoria and islandwood the fact that MS is pushing app porting show that they are insecure about universal apps and rather have a back up plan running if they fail.So if you wish to continue i invite you to rather counter my arguments instead of talking about opinions.,windowsphone,cvnl44a,0,t5_2r71o

They dont purchase phones outright. How many of them are going to preorder these devices? How many will head to the MS Store on release day or in the months after to grab one of these devices?There are ardent fans of Windows Phone that wont be getting these devices because theyre not carried by their carrier and they cant afford them otherwise.It doesnt really bear mentioning that Microsoft has little name recognition in phones like an Apple or Google. But with this particular strategy short term or not Microsoft has all but excluded avid fans of their phones not to mention the average Joe not on ATampT looking to purchase their next device.

5657274,0,t3_3sj5g7,Thought What if the Google UWP were to offer inapp enhancements that would persuade the consumer to use their official application? The application already has the equivalent of a hub if you will to all of their various products and services. Its the icon with the threebythree array of squares. Everything from Gmail to YouTube can be easily accessed from this drawer albeit via the mobile site instead of a native app.But what if they take it to the next level? Google could make these aforementioned drawered product icons to be pinned to Start for easy access. The user experience of these mobile websites could be enhanced by making them inhouse web apps with native navigation bars that complement the mobile website. Or even the introduction of Live Tiles for different Google services.The way I see it Googles merely testing the waters with an allinone application. Things are looking up for their relationship with Microsoft and theres a glimmer of opportunity for them to create a solid Google app for Windows  devices heaven forbid  gasp  other native apps coming to the platform as well such as YouTube and Google Drive.The only question at this point is are there enough users to justify developing official applications? Certainly so for a few services. For example I wouldnt consider it too farfetched if theres a YouTube application for Windows  released in the future. I mean the Xbox  has an official YouTube app and now that Xbox Ones running Windows  it might make sense to capitalize on the UWP platform and enable the app to be used for desktop and mobile as well. But what about for other services? This Google app might be the way they intend to segway into Windows  with little development effort. If the users are present and their services are used from the application theres justification to develop more native apps. Although its all purely conjecture thats the way I see it and its at least slightly plausible in my opinion.Alternatively they could be indifferent to the platform as usual. But its okay to dream a little right?TLDR The Google UWP is a lowcommitment venue for their services and could be the start of a better relationship with Microsoft if its apparent to them that the users are present on the W platform.,windowsphone,cwyc8xa,2,t5_2r71o

Here is a little about the actual production process...I loaded the phone with a SanDisk Extreme Pro GB microSD card.I mounted the phone onto a DJI Ronin M gimbal using a Zacuto baseplate to add weight and overall stability.I work in media production so called in a bunch of favors from using professional makeup artists to HMI lights. I wanted to stress test the phone not to see if I could use it in a professional situation I wont but just for the hell of it.My verdict so far the images we captured look great  almost way to good for the fact that we used a phone. The auto iris is a bummer but I cant really complain as the L was never meant to be used as a pro camera. One major issue I ran into was when I previewed the K video on my phone  the screen had a noticeable line down the middle splitting the image in two  with the bottom portion being darker than the top portion. The actual video is fine its a problem with the screen. Anyone else seeing this? Curiously enough it only happens when I view videos shot in K.So care to know more? Soon Ill sit down to edit and can give you some updates. I will edit in Premire and color grade in Resolve.,windowsphone,cxr34wu,1,t5_2r71o

5900782,0,t1_cxsz8ih,Well again its a matter of perspective. What you consider expensive is probably not.For sake of argument lets say our entire existing staff is  occupied with existing projects into the foreseeable future.  Furthermore we screwed up and didnt hire a single developer capable of writing in any of the languages supported by Visual Studio hard to believe.  So we have to go out and hire a completely new team.Lets say we hire  people and pay them each a salary of  plus full benefits.  And we have to get them the appropriate seat licenses for VS get their PCs desks some training etc. Lets just say this entire Project is composed of incremental cash flows.  Well say total cash outlays are  million just to be conservative I dont believe for a second they would be anywhere near this amount.And lets say were Starbucks  the purpose of this app is not direct revenue that its were not selling it in the app store.  Its part of our overall marketing objective to be present wherever our target demographic is so the incremental cash inflows are amorphous and not readily projectable. We want to be able to interact with our targeted customers directly to gain additional insights into their purchases and push our brand messaging directly to them.That  million  while a lot of money to any one of us or even as an expense item for any one department  is completely IMMATERIAL to my earnings statement and a hell of a bargain when compared to one weeks worth of major media advertising.  As the user base continues to ramp up the case for building an app grows stronger and any possible argument against building one grows weaker.  I believe we passed that point a while back and there is no legitimate argument for any of the Fortune  to not have a presence in the Windows Store if they have occasion to interact with or market to the general public.,windowsphone,cxt4jr4,2,t5_2r71o

With Hello I can unlock it in near darkness while driving at night and just the glow of the car panel. all notifications work fine. Outlook Office  is miles ahead on WM  XL I dont feel like I am using a toy on like I do when I use my iphone or Samsung WP  universal apps are cool and more coming every day there isnt really an app gap and I am bit of a heavy phone user. I presented today at a meeting using my XL  wirelessly connected to the projector. It had my speaking notes on the phone screen while I projected  pretty cool connected my USB flash drives and .in hard drives  it runs them! Continum is so cool that I have to wonder why I need to bring my Surface to bed to browse  I can connect the XL to my TV and get a better on screen Edge browsing experience  and multitask easily Battery life is pretty good on Monday I had the phone unplugged at AMhad to travel to a site and did not have the new USB type c charger with me  the phone lasted all day with average use including on the drive home   hours of Bluetooth music streaming from Groove to my BMW X audio system.

He felt his task was to see if this phone would persuade him to leave his iPhone S at home for a week and maybe use the xl. He concluded he couldnt.In fact if you look at Thurrotts site he makes pretty much the same point in a different way. The Lumias are there for Windows fans. Paul Thurrott has been a massive user of Windows phones for years. Within the scope of what the Verge set out to do it was pretty fair. However it didnt cover every feature for sure. Most sites come to the conclusion that the XL are not a buy except for people committed to the Windows ecosystem. Leaving the app gap aside for a moment you now have Windows  Mobile with no mobile payment platform despite NFC being a leading Nokia feature for years. Music and video services seem to take a step back to year zero with each iteration of the OS and we have the rd rebranding in  years. Then the camera although brilliant now faces pretty good cameras in Android and IOS devices these days.

I havent tried that.However Amazon Music supports it which is where I found out how good it sounds with good headphones Beyerdynamic DT  Pro. I also used it with an external speaker Klipsch KMC  using the wired auxiliary port not through Bluetooth and noticed a good difference there as well.I need to test it through various YouTube apps and Netflix as well. I think there are a few sites keeping running totals of apps that support it. People are hoping LG pushes an update that makes it universal. Again Im not for sure why it isnt now since an external audio amp would be.And yep the G and V are very close.

6182349,0,t3_405f22,Nice improvements. Can we vote on it somewhere to get MS look at it?Seeing the comments its obvious there is still some debatable elements but i think that many things can be fixed by a few new settings. Like a darkmode which will set everything to . I like the color youve chosen. I dont need it to be hidden backgrounds can add to the impression of a page as well.Anyways you werent the first to notice lots of inconsistencies and its of my highest concern right now. But if they would go further i think it will be very nice. Some small things you changed like the amount of apps in collections the browse button for wallpapers the odd lines at times or the inconsistencies with navigation or sizes is neat. Unlike with Apple or Google we currently dont really feel like there is a consistent designteam working on it with specific guidelines that everything MUST follow. And i dont mind them experimenting. But they do it in the final builds too not just the insiders.Anyways if there is a way to get this to the right persons within MS it would be worthwhile. Or have you already had contact? ,windowsphone,cysda8l,1,t5_2r71o

Long press on any folderaccount in the outlook mail hamburger to pin it to start actually this works all over the place  with Groove music albums with Settings with Map locations with OneNote notebooks etc. Press and hold on any quick action in the action center to got to the settings for that thing. If youre looking at open tabs in Edge theres an option to close all tabs in the app bar menu. If you find text in Edge is too small you can open the reading view by tapping the little book icon in the URL bar also there are settings to increase the text for that. If you press amp in the keyboard and slide off at a  deg angle it will switch to symbols view where you can slide to the symbol you want and release and it will go back to ABC. You can change the handedness of the caret stick the little keyboard dot or remove it in keyboard settings. You can quickly get to keyboard settings by press and holding on amp then tapping the gear. Once youre there you can also change the keyboard size dont remember if theres a phone size restriction on this one. On the s if you set the DPI to  System gt Display gt Size of things youll get  items in your quick action rows in the action center. If you then set start to show more tiles Personalization gt Start gt Show more tiles it will give you  columns and you can pin two wide tiles beside each other.

While its not a popular platform and certainly doesnt have as much market share as the main two competitors its still a viable option.  Its still supported its still being developed and third parties are even beginning to announce hardware that supports it Vaio.  The new OS is being built from the ground up.  Of course its got a few bugs.  Apple had the same issues.  Android always has bugs.  Win is still under construction.  Dont let anyone try and tell you otherwise.  Concerning hardware ms is divesting its leftover Lumia design language and branding that it acquired at the start of this and likely going forward with the surface branding and design team.  For now you may not like it but you have your  as an option.  So enjoy it or dont.  Rome wasnt built in a day.  IPhones are good too.  No matter your decision you are spoiled with the amount of tech options you can get your greasy little fingers on.  I dont stick to one manufactureros I think its silly to do so.

6503987,0,t1_czrfm9m,Nokia fully embraced WP that is true and I dont necessarily blame them for what happened. However Nokias present LONGGGGG happened before WP became a thing for them. Their poor mishandling of the previous OS during Android and IOS inceptions and the length of time for them to jump to a more modern OS coupled with Microsofts poor handling of WP is why Nokia is not the same Nokia we know.Furthermore HTC and A few others havent actually tried Plan B. Its no different than my brother. My brother said he was looking for a job. Hes right...He did. Twice...by simply filling out applications and then he never bothered to follow up to see the status of said applications. Sure he applied. But in reality it was a halfass attempt. If he seriously wanted the job he wouldve put more effort into obtaining it.Same with these OEMs. Sure HTC released a Windows version of their lovely M....However ONLY in the US and for the first  months on one carrier before releasing to two more. They still barely acknowledged the phone. It wasnt marketed alongside the M Android. And even on their website it was hidden in a more obscure place. That isnt plan B. Thats Let me just say I did it so I can say I tried but in reality I didnt. No other OEM has done what Nokia did with Windows Phones. It is a risk a huge risk and investment but at the same time these are businesses. Taking risks is kind of the nature of the beast No?Even if you still focus primarily on Android there is little trouble n releasing a Windows Phone of the same variant. There is no real reason not to do so....especially if Microsoft is handling at a OS level. Because in the grand scheme of things beating Samsung or even getting to Samsung level of prominence is a far more difficult task than getting a WP to sale.

6659298,0,t1_d07o2tg,I think we agree on the behavioral differences between  WinPhone amp Android. However you have said  gtI havent seen any evidence that only service owner should be able to launch the app was an explicit decision on Microsofts part rather than the implicit outcome resulting from the lack of a URIintercept model like Androids.  ampnbspgtAs far as I know they only have something that checks the protocol and extension ... Thats not a full URI parser and isnt enough logic to support the desired experience.  ampnbspNow while I cant produce meeting notes from internal Microsoft design sessions I think we can look at what they have implemented and draw reasonable conclusions about their intent no pun intended  .. WinPhone can crack URIs into their constituent parts  not just the scheme part at the start but the data after the scheme as well.  Obviously they couldnt build a functioning browser without this. Plus the SDK exposed to rd party devs has a URI parser   . When WP processes a URI it evaluates it and determines what action to take  this is where I think we disagree.  IMHO This isnt about Android intents of which I have been a fan for a long time. Android intents are generically about having a unified model for leveraginglinking functionality between app components and across apps. Intents are bigger than URI launching. The fact is WP has a model for what happens when you ask the OS to process a URI on your behalf.  WP doesnt need something directly analogous to Android intents to say that it has a model for URI handling. . If WP can fully crack URIs amp it can evaluate a URI on behalf of an app and perform some action it stands to reason that the specifics of what part of the URI they allow to be mapped to launching rd party apps is a design decision.  ampnbspBottom line this disagreement on whether what WP has can fairly be called a URI intercepthandling model hinges on the definition. To me  being able to ask your OS to process a URI on your behalf and perform whatever action it sees fit is in fact URI intercepthandling and the particulars of the decision tree that the OS follows once it is asked to handle a URI is the model. WP has all of that. The model is different from android but that doesnt mean it isnt a model.  ampnbspI think I was wrong on the domain owner registration requirement at google. I agree that that step may only be required for the search features. If so Ill take back my lightertouch suggestion. However this actually gives a possible further insight into WPs approach. WPs approach requires domain owner participation always. Without it security hawks could argue that HTTP links are being subverted and the only thing stopping rogue apps from abusing this is a popup dialog i.e. attentive users and I suppose the hope that thered be enough such users complaining that the rogue app would be identified and banished. You have to agree that Microsoft is everyones favorite tech whipping post. With continuum and the advent of using the same programming models on both phone amp desktop whatever they do suddenly comes under intense scrutiny. If MS was to tell corporate and govt IT departments that on their OS the only thing stopping redirection of all traffic intended for a legitimate website to a rogue app was a popup dialog theyd be laughed out of the room then sued!  ampnbspPost is getting long Pushing my word limit here but if youre still reading this is the last Ill say  I dont believe that anything is fundamental to an OS in the way you seem to be implying. We can talk about what we think every OS should do as baseline functionality but WP Android amp iOS dont share some underlying code base that EVERY OS project starts from that includes launching apps by invoking URIs. The features are there because the vendors put them there with some level of effort no matter how small. Does the WP team share code with other MS teams to inherit some of its features? Sure. Does Android leverage the Linux kernel for some things? Absolutely. But the decision to leverage something is a decision.  ampnbsppost edited  Was a long post had typos and such...may still,windowsphone,d084n7b,1,t5_2r71o

If the app crashed which the app was rather fond of doing the current playlist was lost and youd have to build it back up again.  Podcast Lounge has never lost a playlist on me.

Nor do we ask windows phone OEMs. I never understood why because Microsoft makes the phone and software that every Lumia feature had To go to non Lumias simply because those individual chose otherwise and later regret it. I dont consider myself spoiled. I simply dont see a point in diluting your product in favor of supporting OEMs who technically arent supporting you and releasing these phones as a hobby basically when you have loyalist who buy your products for said features and you are short changing them by just giving them away or discontinuing them. Precisely why I get more mad about Lumia exclusivity loss than what Microsoft does with their android apps. ,windowsphone,d0qyeg7,1,t5_2r71o

6844853,0,t3_49hg2v,Battery issues aside with Windows  Mobile buyer beware.Back a few years ago I did a check of replacement batteries being sold on the Internet.  What I was looking for was a twocell NiMH battery pack.  If wired properly in serial this should be .v  xxxx mAh where xxxx mAh is reflective of the individual cell.  In serial voltage doubles and Amperage is consistent with the smallest cell.  In parallel its the opposite.A lot of battery specs were misreported implying that the battery had the voltage and Amperage specified where it is physically impossible.If the battery manufacturer was a well known manufacturer with a real business website then you probably got what was specified.  If it was a flybynight Chinese knockoff company thats selling second or thirds batteries batteries refused because theyre substandard quality then once again buyer beware.  Your battery problems despite being a new battery and despite having the same specs as the original may be the result of your replacement battery.

6884284,0,t1_d0wcisi,relevanttopic you seem to have misunderstood what Windows Central is and isnt and instead are substituting your own worldview for what you think is a righteous critique even if misinformed. Ill take responsibility for your ignorance and will take the time to explain what our site is even if you frown upon this community and its users and developers.Windows Central has three goals and areas where we focus on. Consumers  We help educate consumers on what products are available review them discuss software apps games bestof howtos tips tricks editorials outreach organization and general news about Microsoft products that people use. Developers  We help developers many of them indie working solo and making very little money get their apps and games featured to help boost their visibility and bring awareness to consumers who may be interested. Developers often call our coverage the Windows Central bump due to a large amount of downloads following our coverage. It goes a long way in helping devs get the attention for their work. It also supports the ecosystem by starting a conversation between devs and consumers often right in our comments section.. Microsoft Windows Central tries to feature review critique Microsoft products and discuss debate and educate on Microsoft strategy and technologies. We cover their events their announcements and general news.With all three of these areas consumers developers and Microsoft Windows Central act as the hub to connect all three groups. We are the ambassadors and representatives of the Microsoft Windows and Xbox community as writers as fans and also as a place for regular users to have their voices heard. Devs talk to and respond to consumers. Microsoft can see how their fans respond to and feel about their products. Consumers get to learn about the latest news about apps games hardware and Microsoft as a company.Sometimes we praise Microsoft. Sometimes we critique them. Other times we remain nonjudgmental. We are however fans and users of the technology we write about. We may be biased but we wear it on our sleeve. We do not pretend to always be objective. We do not write about Windows or Microsoft products while using Apple or Android ones in our real lives. We are not fakers. The writers of Windows Central are all fans of Microsoft technologies and we are passionate about what we do and what we say.Windows Central is not the Verge. We are not Engadget. We are not Ars Technica. Nor are we trying to be or comparing ourselves to them. They are also not us.We have a very different role to play and that is what is described above. Those sites do not help developers. They do not act as a support system for consumers. They rarely go beyond the onetime review of a product following it up with continued help and howtos tips updates progress and working with all three groups to see the ecosystem succeed. They do not have the largest forum community around with volunteer moderators aiding in a place where regular people can just talk about the technology they use and love and hate.You want to put us down. Criticize our role. That is fine. Everyone has opinions and none are more valid than others. But at least be clear in what our site is and what it does and how it differs. We will never make any apologies for our passion our work and our role we play in the world of technology. We are very proud of our work helping consumers fans of Microsoft technology regular users who just want help developers whose work we highlight and acting as a bridge between Microsoft and its users.

Not to mention all those user playlists available in Spotify...does MS even provide playlists in Groove?  I mean you can make your own but are they searchableeasily shared with other people?And though neither app is worthy of an A Spotify is far more consistent when it comes to opening the app tapping a song and hearing it play within a second or two.  I use Groove to stream music from OneDrive and it takes an eternity to resume a song that was previously playing and trying to stream a new one is another  second wait while the title flashes away.Personally Id trade both of these apps for an Apple Music W app.  Probably never gonna happen but Ill continue to dream.,windowsphone,d12gf08,24,t5_2r71o

When I started out I thought it would be able to cure cancer of all stages. So I invited the patients of all stages to test my drug. During testing I found that my drug works really well for stages  and  but it does not work well or even makes conditions worse for the patients of other stages. I tried hard to see if I can make the drug work for everyone but it was not possible. Also I found that if I try to make the drug more effective in future the ingredient that I would need to most rely on would make the condition even worse for these patients. So when time came to announce the drug I had to tell these patients that I cannot give this drug to you. Based on the results I have seen it may work in your case but there are good chances that it will make you worse. But if you still want it you can have it but you will need to use it at your own risk. Also when I come up with newer version of the drug I cannot give it to you at all as you would definitely not be able to handle it.

I guess I should say Im upset too. Microsoft however did give us warning. A year and  months warning. As noted in the post gtgt Windows  has been designed to run well on todays Lumia phones.In context todays Lumia Phones are phones released in . With what they said in December  and all the blogs such as Windows Central saying all WM  phones will get the upgrade Microsoft should have made a point to clarify and reiterate that not all phones will get the update. That was a mistake on their part. They did put that info out there. Regardless of how much you want to believe that you were mislead the statement is very clear. Not all phones running windows mobile . will get the update to windows mobile . They released that statement  year and  months ago. edit .

7002518,0,t3_4bkppb,This may help forgive me if you already know some of thisYou use OneDrive when you want to be able to store your music in the cloud and stream it to any device. If you choose not to use OneDrive then youll need the same music on both devices for your playlists to work. It is important to understand that Groove syncs your playlists but not actual music. For your playlists to work without either OneDrive or a Groove Music Pass you will need to have the same music physically on both devices.   You can do this by manually copying the music via USB. Alternatively if you have music on OneDrive you can download these albums onto the phone to play offline.  The cleanest solution is to store all your music on OneDrive so you can stream it from all your devices and then download any of this music as needed when you want to play it offline.  This avoids all of the physical copying to and from your PC.Re. some of your music appearing in Grooves Cloud Collection  If you dont have a Music Pass music should only show up in Grooves Cloud Collection for two reasons. You purchased the music sometime in the past from Zune MarketplaceXbox Music StoreWindows Store . You used Xbox Music in Windows  and some of your local music was matched at that time. This music locker feature no longer exists in Groove having been replaced by OneDrive streaming however your Cloud Collection is not erasedIf it was me I might start by deleting all of the music on my phone and starting fresh by copying my library over from my PC. You can use an SD card if you need more storage on the phone.  If you want to clean up your Groove Cloud Collection you can do that from settings on the desktop version of the app.Hope this helps.,windowsphone,d1a2w6p,3,t5_2r71o

For the first time I have downloaded Xamarin and have started readingtaking online courses to learn how to develop apps that target Android WP and iOS.  Ill probably target WP first then modify the GUI to also accommodate Xbox and desktop as well. Im not the only one. Reading forums around the web others are doing this too. MS has just brought more developers to their platform. Xamarin has a learning curve because you still have to learn the wrappers for the native calls for platform specific operatios but I am willing to tackle it knowing that the end result is an app that targets three major platforms. I like VS and c and would prefer to develop in it versus EclipseIntelliJ with Java or using a Mac with ObjectiveC.The only tricky thing I will have to do to target iOS is use a service like macincloud.com to use a virtual Mac server to compile my code before I can publish it.

7459266,0,t3_4hhwkn,The best way Ive found is to use a number of services then connect all of the accounts together.I use Fitbit Microsoft Health Myfitnesspal and Runtastics various apps they have separate ones for running pushups abs workouts. Fitbit is the interface I use to view my data and myfitnesspal is the central service that all auxiliary services hook into.Sensor core needs to be set up in Microsoft health once and you can connect Microsoft Health to Myfitnesspal. Once this is done you never need to open MS Health again your steps will be sent as burned calories automatically and seamlessly to Myfitnesspal. It will show up as a calorie adjustment.Myfitnesspals app is not very good though. Luckily Fitbit syncs with Myfitnesspal in both directions and their WP app is great. Use Fitbit to log food log custom workouts track your runs etc. Note that I do not use a Fitbit device the app itself is capable of using your phones GPS to record and map a run. Since Fitbit also pulls data FROM Myfitnesspal any subsequent app you use that connects to Myfitnesspal can be viewed from Fitbit.Thats where Runtastic comes in. I use their running app and their various work out apps all of them have trainers and workout schedules to guide you. Data gets sent to Myfitnesspal. Fitbits app presents me with a nice interface of which days I did what work outs and how many calories I burned.tldr I leverage a bunch of services to talk to each other and the only physical tracker involved is Sensor Core.,windowsphone,d2q2lk3,3,t5_2r71o

The display is crisp and very accurate they have  microphones to record surround sound the awesome camera the battery is quite big.However the software is very lacking not many developers support the OS. The UI is still nice as always though its probably the only saving grace of the software.So if you dont use camera often Id say just buy Mi  its probably the best Android phone for its price and wait until Win  matures probably hate to say this but I really believe it soon.I also hear that Mi  like Mi  will get Windows  Mobile.

8263089,0,t3_4smhyb,. No. You can try Continuum and see if its for you by upgrading your Windows  PC to the latest insider builds and trying the new connect app or if you have any miracast receiver in your place trying through that. If it seems useful to you and it may well be buy the dock. The netflix app does not support continuum but the browser does and it works beautifully.. All those apps work fine. Id suggest Readit rather than Baconit its more feature complete and in active development.. Bluetooth issues have been sorted out since launch.. The Mozo cover is a good idea but only go for a black rim one. The silver  metal ones are much worse quality. I prefer the way my phone feels in my hand with the original cover but the texture of the mozo cover is admittedly amazing. I have a black rim black leather cover that Im selling by the way let me know if youre interested.. I very strongly suggest you join insider fast and get the latest version of Windows Mobile that will launch in three weeks or so. There is also a new firmware available through the Windows Device Recovery Tool that improves camera focusing even more and enables doubletaptowake. Other than that research the hell out of the OS and dont keep the phone unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure you wont miss whatever app may come out for ios or android in a month or a year Pokemon Go made a lot of people here question their choice of mobile OS for example.Let me know if you have any more questions.,windowsphone,d5afzgx,8,t5_2r71o

My app syncs entire profiles of people First name last name phone number building and room number that they are located in department name and devices they own which consist of device names models and types. If I can sync all of that reliably in my app then he can surely sync a couple subreddit favorites. All he would have to do is make a list of subreddit names as strings then same that list as a roaming setting then every time the app opens just read that roaming setting and parse it into a list of strings then parse that into a list of subreddits.

Bought through carrier returned to carrier as tradeins.. HTC X Verizon. My first smartphone bought through carrier. Made me fall in love with Windows. Used it for a couple of months then it really started acting up. All sorts of problems. Verizon Microsoft nor HTC support would help me. Bought a new Lumia Icon after  months with that thing. I do still have the X sitting in my closet because the multiple times Ive put it up for sale nobodys even looked at it. Understandable.... Lumia Icon Verizon. Bought through carrier for full price. My first taste of Lumia. From here on out I said its Lumia or bust. One of my favorite devices. Hell Id probably still have it today if I didnt have to change carriers. I almost traded it in for  at ATampT but decided I could get more on Swappa and did!.. Lumia XL ATampT. Bought through carrier for full price. Didnt sign an ATampT contract never doing that again. Not as powerful as the Icon but still really nice feel to it and I LOVED the larger screen. I ended up consuming this one due to Microsoft temporarily releasing a feature I had no faith in. in reality I sold it to a friend and he still uses it. . Lumia  ATampT GoPhone. Got it on sale from Best Buy for .. Great fuckin deal. That phone was just randomly given to a guy I work with who had an older Windows phone and wanted something a little newer.. Lumia  ATampT GoPhone. Got it on sale from Best Buy for .. Again great fuckin deal. I still have this one. Its excellent for  bucks. . Nexus P I know I know.... Got it unlocked from Screwgle. Tried it for four months. I hate Android so damn much. Sold it on Swappa. . Lumia XL unlocked dual SIM. Current phone. I fucking love this thing. Takes me back to the Icon in terms of specs and that screen...holy shit beautiful.. Lumia  unlocked dual SIM. Just came with the above phone during one of those BOGO deals from Microsoft.

8846341,0,t3_51dcpk,Ive been battling with the idea of how one would  swipe between tiles on the start screen myself. Buttons seems a little to cluttered and fiddly. Optimally youd want to swipe right or left directly on the tile since it feels easy and natural. Itd only work for wide tiles but I think thats a fair compromiseThe problem then becomes if you can swipe horizontally on tiles how do you navigate between start screens? I solved this by moving the global navigation swipe area to the bottom of the screen. That frees up horizontal gestures for the items and the main area. Of course the friction of learning users that new gesture is a bit problematic but could probably be indoctrinated if it was a global gesture and implemented well.Would also be cool to have a gesture for quick actions on tiles so you could perform actions without opening up the app. Unfortunately we dont have force tap which would be perfect for this so I think tap and hold has to be the gesture this however means moving the customize tiles action somewhere else. Quick actions should be more commonly used than moving around tiles however so makes sense.But yeah these kind of changes requires quite some overhaul on the start screen concept so doubtful Microsoft would want to do anything so extreme,windowsphone,d7b7due,2,t5_2r71o

9108651,0,t1_d86ofq7,Automatically adapting doesnt relieve from testing to see if its actually working well.But leaving that argument aside for now If we assume that devs start developing their programs exclusively for the Windows Store which at least on the traditional Desktop where the majority of those M users are currently located has a really slow adoption rate it will still take a while for it to see a real rise in quality apps since there is no huge incentive to develop for the store. Traditional distributing works fine enough and users are not used yet to get their programs from a builtin store. Also UWP still has to mature as flexible development framework.I would say that currently an extremly tiny percentage of all Windows  users knows that there is a store and have actually installed much less bought an UWP app from it...So this wont happen in weeks or months but years. When that happens Windows  Mobile may yet have chance in the consumerspace again. As it stands right now its unfortunately much more trouble than its worth and Id really be surprised if there will be a good low and mid device lineup again like weve seen with Nokia. Its just not profitable enough and there dont seem to be any arguments for it any longer. Also Who except for enthusiasts really wants to pay for a highend WP device considering the other alternatives?As a disclaimer I might add that I am really really annoyed as WP was the best choice for me and I was hoping since . that the platform might start gaining traction.

However in fairness I think that this is a change that is more about W and a desire that WM should be properly aligned to it than addressing Ws shortcomings.Someone on rwindowsphone recently summed up the problems with iOS and Android in a really poetic description of two ships.  Basically iOS is inflexible and overpriced and Android is a bit of a mess with everyone doing different things and working at cross purposes.  There are a lot of really amazing things about WPWM and the user experience is actually very nice.  If MS threw a whole load of resources at it did some focus group work like you suggest looking at what it does better than iOSAndroid and whats lagging behind and made some really nice phones then perhaps they could find a market of people who are disillusioned with the two mainstream choices.Everyone goes on and on about the app gap me included but in reality  of the use I make of my phone is taking photos callingmessaging and web browsing.  For me most of my annoyance with WM is the lack of compatibility and support for  third party hardware smartwatches my car that sort of thing and thats something that investment could help fix.Its a shame that such a nice platform is dying and I genuinely feel like it could be a success because so many people are disillusioned with the other platforms and want to join us except for focus group needed.,windowsphone,d8htzae,2,t5_2r71o

With google voice blocking a number also prevents them from leaving a voicemail.

They took  steps backwards to take  steps forward. And were still fighting to get features back that we had all along in WM.

10004426,0,t3_5iwzbk,This is because the time is off.  Try another authenticator app or one on your computer. I used Authenticator for Windows which works on W and my phone. It uses OneDrive so it syncs between all of my computersphone which is nice.I had this problem earlier on my phone with Authenticator for Windows but not Microsoft Authenticator.  And it was only for TeamViewer which seems to be more picky about the time window than some of the other services.I figured it that it was slow by writing down the codes between the computer and the phone.  Thats when I noticed my phone was behind by like a minute.  I got it resolved only because I got a new XL as part of the warranty exchange.

10490121,1,t1_dcx4z4a,I doubt devoting some of their skills to make an app they want to use is jeopardising their livelihood. Example time. Im a developer I work at company A. I have a  hour work week. Hell let say .  hour a day  days a week. I happen to be a fan of the Windows ecosystem and even have a Windows phone. I also like to go to the range on the weekends. I need a shot timer so I go to the store to download an app and I see there isnt one that hits all the check boxes that I would like. Well I hop online when I get home from the range and look up an open source shot timer. I find one and look over the code. Then look at some paid apps to view some advance features. Then I lay out exactly what I want the app to do and get to work. Over the next  months I put in a few hours of work on the app over the weekend and produce an app. Being that I enjoy going to the range and I couldnt find an app when I wanted one I decide to publish it to the store with an donate option. I then get on reddit like I would do anyway and let the subs involved with Windows guns and competitive shooting know that I created an app for Windows.  See what I just explained was passion for something. It wasnt for a pay check and it didnt impact my normal job in any way.

Google Photos does photo management offline obviously things that are stored remotely wont be usable offline just as with MS Photos and content stored on OneDrive. Gmail works offline just as well as the Outlook app does  obviously both need an internet connection for any local changes to sync to the server.You stated that Googles apps such as Photos Drive Maps Gmail dont do diddly squat offline  unlike say MS Office which is completely self contained and fully featured without an Internet connection. My point in responding was simply to state that that is not the case.Now of course Googles services dont work offline on larger devices unless they run on iOS Android or Chrome OS or for DocsSheetsSlides the Chrome offline extensions which brings us back to the original point.,windowsphone,dd425nq,1,t5_2r71o

10661213,0,t3_5h4maj,This is going to be long.I just switched from a Lumia  to a refurbished Motorola Droid Turbo. The Droid is still very new to me so well see how it turns out. Im still getting used to it. But WP is no longer cutting it for me for a number of reasons.I was a latecomer to the smartphone world and the  was my first device. I was going on a trip and looking for a way to to navigate connect manage itineraries and take good pics and so it seemed like a good time to jump in. With no set allegiance to any brand I was entirely platformneutral. The  seemed like the perfect fit.As time has gone on things have changed. For one the app gap has truly gotten to me. There are certain services in the modern world that I could never access and that was getting really old. Online dating services ridesharing Im in Austin and we no longer have Uber and anything else that wasnt available through a web browser were all closed off to me. I had enough.Beyond that there was overall functionality. The Facebook app was shit but using Explorer or UC Browser was only marginally better. I cant tell you how many times Ive had an app fail to open or crash for no reason. Id power off and restart and it would still happen. Ugh.As for the noted camera there were a number of developments that have made me reconsider. One its not as great as advertised color is hitandmiss and lossless zoom is hogwash. Second while other phones havent replicated the megapixel count theyve still caught up in other areas of image quality  its no longer the big guy on the block. Third Ive taken photography more seriously since first purchasing it and so the optics arent even a real priority anymore  phones still pale in comparison to real cameras in a lot of cases. Ive moved on.On top of all that the  isnt upgradable to Windows . I was done.So Im giving Android a shot. As I said well see how it goes. I harbor no illusions I know its only a device and one thatll have its own quirks shortcomings and inevitable obsolescence. But already it feels good to be on the inside looking out for once. If theres anybody out there like me who is considering this OS Id suggest that they really consider the various costs beforehand.,windowsphone,ddfmfsz,2,t5_2r71o

Im currently looking at unity for the environment and scripting in C but i seem to change my mind every other day about a lot of related aspects so who knows how it will end up.

10690353,0,t1_ddilssr,Yeah and the interesting thing about phonebased VR is that its pretty much the only area Ive found where theres a serious app gap on iOS the App Store has a bunch of  video content but very little quality interactive VR content of any value the inability to connect any type of controller is one of several impediments. By comparison Android has a lot more Cardboard VR apps but as even rGoogleCardboard can attest to even Cardboard on Android is pretty sparse  a ton of really shallow experiences and inconsistent ones hence Googles second take on the problem with Daydream. So even a few highquality experiences could make WM a player in this area. Now obviously MS has big plans for VRARMR through the Creators Update headsets and Hololens but theres no indication of anything for WM nor is WM a priority in general so for now its entirely dependent on the handful of people who are both interested in VR and use WM.Unity and C probably make the most sense for this sort of thing.I usually use my S and HTC M for Cardboard apps despite the XLs hardware theoretically being better than both for VR larger screen higher resolution true blacks with AMOLED since the Windows app store makes the iOS Cardboard selection look like an absolute gold mine at present.,windowsphone,ddimq85,1,t5_2r71o

Remember the Lumia  got  GB RAM while all other Lumias had  GB just because of the good Zeiss camera and postprocessing and there were rumors that the OS cant use the second half of that memory.. I dont know I never owned one... I wouldnt buy a PC to game or work with less than  GB more likely .And I wouldnt buy a notebook to surf around tablet or smartphone with less than  GB actually.

11433190,0,t1_dfrwz9w,A couple of things.I dont know of any smartphone that can have a messaging app go faulty. Thats literally one of the devicetypes core apps.My Elite x has been hard reset enough times in its short service life with me so far. Each reset has fixed some things and broken others. In its previous incarnation Edge completely refused to work crashing immediately after launch aka a deal breaker for an enterprisefocused phone. Now this issue is not something that warrants time spent on a hard reset hence Ive elected to go with Skype for SMS as a compromise for now. Im sure you can see why Im choosing not to reset the phone yet again given the circumstances leading to its latest reset. With that said...... I suppose the WP fans eventually have to ask themselves whether the user is expected to put up with a phone whose messaging app can go faulty theres actually no indication otherwise that it is it does SMS just fine and have to do a full reset or resort to interop tools for a fix. Of all the things that have gone wrong with my Androids and iPhones I think Ive got something stupid like  of various phones around the house the ability to customize the SMS tone and have a fully functioning messaging app has never faltered. Its just something people have come to expect of phones ever since the first dumb mobile phones arrived on the market. And really this is just the tip of the iceberg regarding the issues with the OS issues that have nothing to do with the app gap at all. Whichever way you want to look at it somethings wrong somewhere when a phone OS is designed in such a way as to allow this to happen.,windowsphone,dfrxv6b,2,t5_2r71o

Dual front facing selfie camera rig with IR maybe one top one bottom for landscape mode or alternate portrait modeIn general I often rotate the phone to landscape for Netflix YouTube camera etc then back to portrait for messing etc. Then back to landscape. Sometimes I flip the landscape orientation to deal with physical buttons on the sides. It would be cool if there was no definite end if you get what I mean? The phone would work in portrait when held at either end and the home screen would reorientate. This would obviously have implications physically but I hope its the main reason for virtual buttons over fixed capacitive ones.,windowsphone,dft4rn1,1,t5_2r71o

To me its very obvious  few in Microsoft are using Windows  Mobile phones. From the beginning they should have had feature parity with iOS and Android. Remember Windows phone NOT having copy and paste in its first iteration. I think mango was the first one to have it. Why when its obvious its an essential feature. Sometimes Im amazed at how out of touch they are. Win apps stored on a phone but executed on something like that laptop dock Apple patented that I linked in another comment that could actually be useful and not gimmicky.

11491976,0,t1_dfykymm,So? The whole point of this stuff is to actually have a product to offer to consumers. MS may be doing wizardry behind the scenes playing some  dimensional chess but until they can actually turn that into a product that  works and  actually appeals to people it really doesnt matter. So far theyve spent years trashing efforts and burning through customer and developer goodwill while iOS and Android actually have a product people want. In however many years time if MS miraculously comes out with some x version of W for phones and lets be honest about the potential for that that still doesnt matter if people dont want it or dont care. To people who live in the WM bubble the appeal of having more apps is probably pretty strong but for current Android and iOS users you know...  of the market who actually have a ton of apps already to do all the things they want to do on a phone it probably isnt something they even care about.,windowsphone,dfym4kk,11,t5_2r71o
