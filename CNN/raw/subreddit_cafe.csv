2418229,0,t3_2mq6qp,Perhaps they can negotiate a lower rent payment.  Now that the fracking industry has pretty much abandoned Tioga County the real estate will sit empty for quite awhile.They are in a tough spot though.   feet away is a Dunkin Donuts with easy parking in the Tops shopping center and McDonalds right around the corner from there.  Dunhams just down the street has a cafe that sells Starbuckss coffee.  The Wellsboro Diner and the Native Bagel are real close.  Even if they moved to Mansfield where the college is there are already two coffee shops in place.The makeup of Tioga County doesnt help.  Dont get me wrong the native people here are warm friendly and helpful but quality food is not a high priority.  Their idea of a kaiser roll isnt even a good hamburger bun . . . you cant even buy Russian Dressing in the supermarkets here.  Chinese takeout is exotic furrin fare.  Think about it you wouldnt even know what good coffee was without the exposure you got at the store.  How can you educate others who are literally comfy in the Dark Ages? The existing market is helped by the county seat and court house business.  I know the Native Bagel has a better location and better parking for that but can they arrange delivery to the courthouse?  The Pop Culture has gaming night on Friday nights can you get a tie in?  Can they market themselves to the high school crowd more?  My daughter used to hang out there with her friends once a week but they all went to out of town colleges.  So the takeaway is to try and replace the younger folks as they grow up and move away.

9995797,0,t1_dbagqep,I like coffee and want to get into it deep enough to have a good cup of coffee at my house I have a standard coffee maker. At my volunteer fire house they have a massive Keurig machine and although it does the job the coffee is lacking in flavor. I thought about a small Keurig and just keeping it in my locker with the reusable pod but even then the coffee just doesnt taste right. What exactly is the Chemex you speak of and how artful is making a cup of coffee? Is it one of those the first few times I use it it may not be great but once I get it down itll be good? And how time consuming are we talking? Also thanks for the help.,cafe,dbahbfe,4,t5_2rwin

To avoid diarrhea Ive heard caffeine pills work I know you said you dont see them locally can you buy online?. Or perhaps eating a high fiber meal right before your coffee intake will help firm things up. ,cafe,ddgfu8s,1,t5_2rwin
