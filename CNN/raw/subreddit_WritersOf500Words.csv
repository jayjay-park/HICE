8736652,0,t3_4znomh,This was nice. I actually like how its something we can relate to but set the future with things we currently look forward to.Although as a reader this might have been more rewarding for me if I hadnt had the predisposition of you mentioning it as scifi. This is partly why I ask only for titles in the title  prejudgments expectations and misconceptions can and will taint a readers experience when meeting a storys twist like yours  truth is I was anticipating the scifi aspect and that lost some of the Oh. Oh!? OH RIGHT!. However I expect that people would like to find the type of story they are searching for ie I am in a scifi mood so Im between a rock and hard place.Hmm. For now please keep the genre and the number out of the title. My reason is that I dont want to isolate people from reading what they think they wont like due to the genre mention alone.I have recently read A Warriors Death  and for the most part knowing the genre then seeing the writing.. it completely overshadows the beauty of the ending  to which I have had to slightly ruin by bringing it up.After everything thankyou for your contribution! ,WritersOf500Words,d6xqa8m,6,t5_3fwli
8764404,0,t3_504r81,Raid!Jack sprung awake the tinny beepbeep of the tripwire at the gate alerting him to intruders.  He looked at the alarm clock on the bedside table  a.m.  Feds.  It meant that they had a warrant and were coming to search his house or arrest him or both.Jumping out of bed he clicked an app on his smartphone and scrolled through the cameras as he headed toward the office in the basement.  There they were six cars including a marked police car.  He only had three minutes until they were inside.He had always known this day would come.  It had been a good run but they had eventually caught up with him.  Now he just needed to reduce the damage.  As he entered the office he flicked on the lights and went over to the server cabinet.  He yanked the harddrives out of the three servers and the RAID array.  Onebyone he placed them next to the electromagnet in the bottom of the cabinet and held them there for  seconds erasing everything.He glanced at the screen of his smartphone as a dozen men and women in tactical gear came up the front walk while others circled the house.  A uniformed officer was in the middle of the pack heading toward the front door.Jack placed the drives back into the servers and the RAID array.  With the evidence destroyed he only had a minute or so to make it look like he had not been here.  He went over to the keyboard on his desk and signed into his fake email account and brought up a Yahoo! search page.The desktop was a red herring it was never used for the actual jobs or even personal communications.  In fact it had been specifically setup to be found if there was ever a raid.  The browser history would show searches for condos in Aspen TripAdvisor reviews of restaurants and car rentals among other mundane content.A password file on the desktop would lead investigators to the bank accounts he used for paying bills and into which the profits from his consulting business were deposited.  But there would be no links to the offshore accounts his bitcoin stash or a variety of other financial accounts he controlled.As the officers announced their presence and began the slow process of knocking in his front door Jack sent a quick email to the dummy account from a neighbor.  The email wished Jack a great time in Aspen and confirmed that the neighbor would collect the mail and water the plants.Jack turned off the light and activated the screensaver on the desktop before grabbing his encrypted laptop and sliding open the secret compartment in the bookcase behind the desk.  He squeezed inside the small compartment and waited.He heard the front door splinter and tracked the progress of the officers as they cleared each room.  Eventually they made it down to the office.  He held his breath and listened.,WritersOf500Words,d717nhe,3,t5_3fwli
