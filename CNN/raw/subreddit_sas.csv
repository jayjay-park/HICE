4637019,0,t1_ctf1das,Thats because those datasets are are both SAS datasets as source.Oracle tables are different. SAS typically treats them very similar thanks to a product you have installed on the server called SAS Access to Oracle. Sometimes the Access to Oracle engine can save processing and IO power on SAS by passing certain tasks to oracle. In your code this is happening in the count. Instead of SAS getting the results of  and then counting them it asks Oracle to do the count function. I believe Oracle is also returning the results of date to checkit. Instead of SAS performing date because Date is also a function in oracle. Try adding order by testcount to the end of the proc sql because order is calculated at the result instead of the query you may get your expected behavior. ,sas,ctf2c1t,3,t5_2r7tp

And the professor wants forecast equations for both  pack and  liter that he will use in predicting from the actual data on the various independent variables for October   to August  . Variables I have are ID number week in date format pepsi  pack volume std units pepsi  liter pack volume std units pepsi  pack promotion dummy pepsi  liter promotion dummy coke  pack promotion dummy coke  liter promotion dummy pepsi  pack price pepsi  liter price coke  pack price coke  liter price pepsi  pack volume t pepsi  liter volume t weeks since Oct   and many holiday and season dummies like Labor daySpringso forth,sas,cvlp2w9,1,t5_2r7tp

5952586,0,t3_3wx38o,Are you familiar with ODS?  It stands for Output Delivery Systemput this before the proc report statementgt ods tagsets.MSOfficeK stylestatistical fileltfile path there you want the outputfilename.xlsgtand then this at the endgt ods tagsets.MSOfficek closethis will put the report into an excel file.some notes the MSOfficeK is just one of many types of output that ODS can deliver for you tagsets.MSOfficeK  There is a tagset for excel specifically that lets you format columns and headers and stuff.  Just google ODS for the full set of options. the statistical in the style  statistical is basically a template.  Again you have more options. the output file is actually an xml file that you force to have an .xls file type.  But since excel can read xml it will open up like a regular excel file.  however when you save it if you just click on save it will save it as an html file.  You have to change the type to xls or xlsx. along with that my computer used to do this thing where you get a message that says file type doesnt match or some crap like that when it tries to open the excel file after you run the ODS.  Just click on open anyways its fine.  Theres a setting you can change in the registry to force it to recognize that its an excel file but i forget exactly what it is.  again google is your friend here.,sas,cxzwx70,1,t5_2r7tp

7581753,0,t1_d33svgd,I think SQL can handle everything at once with DISTINCT and its more inefficient to use SQL and then SORT.      PROC SQL       CREATE TABLE summed AS      SELECT DISTINCT ItemID Version SUMQuantity      FROM old      GROUP BY ItemID Version     QUIT  You could even do all of this with a sort and a data step not use SQL at all but its a bit more involved codewise and it might not be more efficient. ,sas,d340b1g,1,t5_2r7tp

Im not sure where to store the excel file and how to reference it for it to work. I suppose it needs to be in the designated folder and then I need to use not a windows type path but a unix one.

Them use a data step or proc transpose to shape it further.Edit this example would work with arrays but to be honest Id have to try it to tell you exactly how.You can make two dim array then do a loop within the loop.

9326073,0,t1_d8xxrkm,Actually I should mention debugging in SAS is super easy because of the implicit save of the programdata state as you run the programeverythings in work. So whereas in something like Python Id have to litter the code with print statements or set breakpoints in SAS I can save a copy of the datasets before and after executing code that may be bugged. The coderundebug loop can end up being much faster.,sas,d8y5ct5,2,t5_2r7tp
