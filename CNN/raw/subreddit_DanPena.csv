As I said I have not even attended his castle seminar but unlike you I have followed and listened to the man and found it to be very helpful. You have baseless arguments. You have rejected his statements saying he has no proof or he is bragging when the proof is all there ONLY if you had read or listened to his audios amp videos. Why would Dan waste time on a moron like you? He has gazillions of things to do better than arguing with you. He would rather play golf. I dont think you have any idea of what being a highperformance person is like. I am trying every day working on my business countless hours battling through emotions and I cannot even get close to being that. It takes mammoth effort and strict discipline a constant mental battle to fight against your own lazy habits and limited beliefs that been the building blocks of our belief and perception since we were a child. So you cannot just turn into a highperformance person overnight. Hence you need a mentor like Dan who constantly pushes you to the limit. Thats why Dan is way he is..Ask yourself one question.. did any of the Olympic athletes won GoldSilverBronze medal based on easy or normal lifestyle or wasting time talking about someone for days weeks or months? Just imagine the sacrifice they had to make aka pay price to action as Dan says. And how are you going to achieve greater things in life when . of the guru talks about the usual happyclappy feel good businesslifestyle motivational law of attraction etc. rubbish when in reality it takes so much effort and sacrifices that even these selfhelp gurus have never undergone to achieve so much. They make living out of selling seminar seats and upselling. If it was that easy why is there only a few successful people i.e. Bill G Warren B Steve J Mark Z Elon M Richard Branson etc. etc. out of billions of people in the world. So what Dan is trying to do is to change your limiting belief and push you to the highest level as possible so you can achieve what you have never thought you could. That takes motivation changing your belief shouting and accounting for everyday day hours pushing you to the limit and dragging you across the goal line when you are ready. Thats what Dan is doing. We should recognise this as a favor. Try getting another person with the same wealth level as Dan. See if you can get through their personal assistant. See if you can hire a sports person or celebrity and they will send you astronomical bills for anything i.e. endorsement or appearing in your parties etc. People spends k on cigarette and alcohol in  years. You think its very expensive when it cane change your lifestyle? The sooner you realise this the faster you will be able to make a decision in your life as to whether being a highperformance person is the right thing for you. If its not stop wasting time and talking rubbish with baseless arguments. Period!,DanPena,d6rz1dl,1,t5_357bi
