That was certainly him on the piano but some of the pieces were recordings he had to sync up with Damien mentions this in an interview cant remember which. You can also notice this during the scene when Mia first sees him play one of the faster runs doesnt match with his fingering.Doesnt change anything for me though. I know he played a lot of it. Im simply in awe that he can play like that.,lalaland,ddil27v,2,t5_2s0f8
