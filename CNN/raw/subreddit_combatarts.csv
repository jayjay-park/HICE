3312362,0,t1_cp58p9f,Well here is the style of fma that I trust with my life.  I still disagree with some stuff but most of it I trust.       What I disagree with is what they call technical and live blade sparring.  The technical one is where they pull their shots. Which I guess you could do if all you can afford is sticks but I prefer some safety gear and actually hit. Live blade is using real swords but pulling shots like the other one.  Which I really really disagree with.  I would never train against someone with a real sword.  For cutting and solo training yeah.  they show off as much as other styles  but I just like the effort they put into training and attackdefending.,combatarts,cp5u5bb,1,t5_2v0lj
3578657,0,t3_2xydu7,Whats up with the idea of a bow being tactical. Just because shooting it is some what quiet doesnt make it stealthy or tactical. Especially speed shooting is non tactical at all. You dont have power. The arrows rattling around will make noise the bow string vibrating will make noise. Plus you have to reload and lose the element of surprise after the first arrow.  Since arrows wont kill unless you get a good shot. Is called a gun with a suppresser. You are really quiet maybe even more then the bow.  You have multiple ammo at the ready with multiple mags. Also you are a smaller target. ,combatarts,cq0717x,0,t5_2v0lj

4391248,0,t1_cskj5ua,Actually if you mean guidedogs they are no help at all in any kind of physical conflict. They specifically choose the dogs that have no fight in them to be guide dogs because a guide dog has to be  docile and calm in public. So the best you can hope for from a guide dog is to bark loudly to attract attention but usually that just leads to the dog getting hurt too That said I did find one example of a guidedog saving its owners handbag from a muggerNot sure just how effective the dog wouldve been if its a gunman or a knifer as we trained against in our drills though ,combatarts,cskmo80,2,t5_2v0lj
4508720,0,t1_csyxhyr,No its not choreographed. The guy thrusts at him so he gets OFFLINE  which so many people from other styles dont and just stand there trying to grab the arm. Hes going slow right now to show. Especially when hes said to keep attacking him because hes the attacker and they dont stop.  ,combatarts,csyz1sx,1,t5_2v0lj

10754401,0,t1_ddp64kn,Tbh I feels like its not the full technique. By that I mean you are throwing it from the elbow which is quick and simple. Both good things when using a blade but it would be worth adding in the footwork IMO. Project into distance attack get out of distance. Or alternatively finish by wrapping up etc. Thats why I like the back hand when I close distance the front hand is working,combatarts,ddp8gyj,1,t5_2v0lj
