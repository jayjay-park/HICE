931059,0,t3_24lb92,This wasnt the planned ending which is why it aired this way. At the end of season  farscape was renewed for  more seasons. The crew got  a phone call from scifi channel on the last day of filming and were told the series was canceled. Scifi channel didnt have a budget for farscape and the newly picked up stargate series and decided to go with earth based scifi. It was rumored the new owner of scifi channel didnt like space scifi shows! Seriously wtf!? It was too late to change the ending or film anything else. I participated in a live online chat with the crew mere hours after they got the call.Fans of the show were of course outraged which is how the peacekeeper wars came  into fruition. Lots of angry letters to scifi execs and protests to sponsors of the show gave us an ending that we demanded for.,farscape,cha46od,3,t5_2rfae

4661380,0,t3_3ep0vr,Theres really no best episode to bring someone to watch Farscape. Most of the fun episodes are totally bonkers and the great ones that make overall story go forward would spoil a full watch after that.Getting into Farscape is a process. You watch the pilot and you get thrown in this weird and kind of kitschy universe just like Crichton is. And like him youre trying to comprehend and get comfortable in this universe as you go along before going deeper into the story. Theres no real shortcut to get into Farscape and enjoy it. If youre not comfortable with making that person watch from the start you could maybe try to see how heshe reacts to A Human Reaction. ,farscape,cti4g16,1,t5_2rfae

6111429,0,t1_cyk8x3c,gtIMO there arent really any hard scifi tv shows. The Expanse so far seems pretty hardish. I havent read the books so I dont know where it is headed. The BSG reboot perhaps until they get into the mystical stuff at the end if you disregard FTL travel. Dark Matter again disregarding FTL travel might qualify depending on how it goes in coming seasons. Nothing sticks out in memory as too outlandish. Killjoys is still TBD. A lot of stuff with self replicating nanomachines making people superpowered essentially. Not sure if this exceeds your threshold of believability or not. Firefly was more or less reality based except for the magical seeming gravity on the ship but  of the episodes took place on a terraformed world of some description. I suppose none of the ships were really all that aerodynamic despite constantly maneuvering in atmosphere... I guess youd also have to look past the telepathyempathy. I lost interest quickly with The  because it was first and foremost a teen drama in a scifi setting but it seemed to be at least trying to be somewhat realistic. That robot cop show on FOX that only lasted  season featuring Karl Urban as technophobic human cop. Almost Human? Person of Interest if sentient AI fit your definition of scifi. Ascension... sort of and again telepaths.,farscape,cykb1zs,2,t5_2rfae

8424880,0,t3_4v0km8,I like Revenging Angel quite a bit but I just dont like the episodes placement in the order. I guess its supposed to be a lighthearted breather episode but for me it comes more across as a momentum killer where its at in the order. I think Magellan rightly pointed out that it doesnt really work because of the nature of the two crews A Crichton may be having whacky cartoon adventures but that doesnt change the position that Talyns crew is in which is a dark one.One upside of this episode is I think its the last time we see John and DArgo consistently being at odds and they start getting back to the bros we want them to be.I dont know why cartoon John is so scared of cartoon DArgo because cartoon DArgo is adorable.The translator microbe thing that got me throughout this stint of episodes was when Talyn John started teaching Aeryn English because you would think that no matter what English things John tried to teach shed hear them as Sebacean.  The only thing I can figure is that we as viewers are just hearing and seeing everything in English as a shorthand but whats really happening is that the crew hear things in the alien language but still understand them? I dont know  Im just trying to make sense of nonsense.I love Babylon  so much. Like Farscape it has a lot of shaky episodes in the first season but then gets way better. One drawback to it though is that it was made in the s and it looks and feels very much like a show made in the s  from the CG to the costumes. I imagine itll always be in my top five though. It also has some decent tiein movies and the production mess that was the spinoff Crusade. And theres the failed Legend of the Rangers pilot. If you get around to doing this show there will be plenty to talk about.I watch the new Dr. Who when the new episodes show up on Netflix but Im not a dyedinthewool Whovian. I enjoy the show but its an enjoyment that often feels like work. Sometimes I have the impression that Dr. Who doesnt really like its audience but it knows it has its hooks in them.I was active in SciFis Farscape message board back in the day and there was a pretty popular member who went by AirNSun and while I dont recall anybody postulating that it implied that Aeryn was Johns air and sun I do remember it being a name quirk that was talked about.I get why The Choice had to happen Not only did they have to close the books on the Talyn crews story but they also couldnt dump Aeryn back with the Moya crew and have it just be business as usual without addressing her grief especially with another John hanging around. But I think I covered that last week by saying it was a nicelooking episode that wouldve been perfect if it were  minutes long.Im totally with Allen regarding Cresus The second I saw him I thought They surgically removed Kuato?!I enjoyed watching Lost in Space repeats when I was a kid but they do not hold up well at all to watch as an adult. Watching for referencechecks is about the only reason to ever consider watching it now.You wondered how where and if Farscape popped up in other media and the thing that immediately popped to mind was the Stargate SG episode  where theres a scene in which they imagine a Farscape version of the show. But if anything it was more of a nod to Ben Browder and Claudia Black who were both on SG at that point.Were really hitting the ground running now with Fractures and IYensch You Yensch with the latter having some great Rygel moments. Its also sort of an unofficial first part to a episode arc.,farscape,d5unguk,7,t5_2rfae
8489281,0,t1_d62ohn2,theres also scapecast podcast. Last few years they have been rewatching it also with a bit more traditional  format of a couple of hosts a newbie watcher and a veteran some of those watched the show dozens of times,farscape,d62ph88,2,t5_2rfae
8601906,0,t1_d68ccz3,Tobey Maguire was great at wisecracking.  Andrew Garfield great actor but...not so much.  Same with Crichton.  Few could pull that off.  That and the cultural references which no one but Crichton got would be lost on most new fans.    except maybe for my favorite Aeryn attempt at slang He gives me a woody.  Crichton WHAT?!?Aeyrn A woody.  He gives me a woody.  Crichton pauses.  thinks.  WILLIES!!  He gives you the willies!!  ,farscape,d6gtyxi,1,t5_2rfae
8882044,0,t3_51tcmd,I think the two episodes of What Was Lost contribute to the overall sense that theres a drop in quality in season four and I understand where those feelings come from. In a lot of ways these episodes dont feel like Farscape. Everything is still unbalanced from the ending of season three  crew members start rolling in with no great explanation of why they came back or whats going on and they get caught up on this planet and in this story neither of which feel like they mean anything. You feel the lack of presence of Aeryn and for me Moya and Pilot. It just feels wrong. I think it plants a bunch of false flags about the shape and tone and theme of the season and some people just bought into that at face value which is understandable. I didnt like these episodes myself but now I can look back and see that theyre not as seasondefining as they seemed to be at the time.You mentioned feeling a shift in Chianas character and I think its related to something else you mentioned  that Sikozu and Chiana feel like very similar characters. I think what was happening here was instead of them trying to strictly adjust Sikozu so that she would fit better with Chiana I think they started tweaking both characters a bit so that they fit better with each other.All I can say about Noranti is that I didnt care for the character at this point. But by the end of the season shes a strong favorite of mine. And Ive got nothing to say about Bracca just yet.Grayza  so shes a character we have now. And shes a different kind of evil than Scorpius somehow lessclinical but more indifferent. As far as the rapey stuff goes John does bring it up again. Ill just leave it at that for now.That Netflix description of Lavas A Many Splendored Thing is a terrible description of that episode. Theres nothing there that hints at how odd and funny the episode is. And Promises closes what Id say is the first season  arc  the arc Id call Getting the Band Back Together.,farscape,d7fhvan,2,t5_2rfae

9641460,0,t3_5d3cdw,I think youre insane to think season  went downhill. It was brilliant. When the duplicate Crichton died it was hard hitting even though there was a second out there. It wrecked Aryn and was important to everything to show how far Crichton would go to protect this technology. With only one left it lent a lot of weight to his decisions the rest of the series. When the stakes did go up farther it made it all the more realistic to expect that he would do something insane that might end up taking his own life protecting Earth and Arynbabeh. My only regret is that while Im grateful we got the Peacekeeper Wars miniseries that it wasnt a full season . The comics after are good though and afaik are canon. ,farscape,da1ibef,7,t5_2rfae
