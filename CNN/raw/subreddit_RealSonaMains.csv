6454041,0,t1_czmn1nh,Personally I feel like you build some AP but certainly not full AP if the game is a serious one. Maybe something like FQC and MorelloAdrentZekes at best and then grab AegisFrozen HeartMikaels. The problem I feel with full AP is that it just needs a crapton of money to get it to work and as a support with  waveclear its really hard to get that money in the first place.,RealSonaMains,czmw1mu,1,t5_39uth
