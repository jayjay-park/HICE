4693518,0,t1_ctm3t72,How interesting. My family and I have grown sapote from seed a few times but not white sapote. Usually with big hard seeds cracking or filing the outer coat is helpful to speed up germination. Yours should come up okay I would think.,HawaiiGardening,ctm5qs3,3,t5_38ro7
4693541,0,t1_ctm5qs3,Awesome thank you. Did yours take a long time to germinate? I know they can take about  years to bear fruit and are often grown by seed for root stock. Im mainly expiramenting with fruits I can grow by seed. ,HawaiiGardening,ctm5uib,3,t5_38ro7
4700181,0,t3_3fb3vj,AlohaIm not familiar with the microclimates on Maui. I would assume youd need to be very high elevation to ever need to concern with frost. Yes to me elevation plays a big key in plant success. Or even allows potential for various edibles to thrive. Im high elevation on the Big Island and we get cooler than average winter temps at night. But nothing under  in my lifetime. Because we get chilly in the winter we do have apples on our land. But those are still low chill hour cultivars. We also have lemons oranges avocado coffee and a plethora of other edibles. However mangos do not thrive where we are. So theres a bit of give and take. I think the choice is yours when buying land. Most people prefer to have already matured trees in food production vs. waiting years for trees to bear. Perhaps buying land that has producing trees and plenty space to add other things youre interested in is a good balance. Avocados average  years to produce. Many trees sold in nurseries are already a decent age so you might only need wait a few years instead. Youre best bet when searching for land and a house is to contact your local county extension CTAHR office. They will provide you with free localized expert advice on all things edible plants trees elevation pros and cons salt questions soil testing etc. You can write out a list of favorite fruits veggies and flowers to take to the office and ask questions regarding elevation and even how to best plant or care for each. They can help you go over the list and tell you if those things would thrive on the potential land youre considering purchasing. Thats the best advice I have to offer. Hopefully someone from Maui will respond to your questions too. Best of luck and keep us posted when you buy your property. ,HawaiiGardening,ctmzw8s,2,t5_38ro7

5532770,0,t1_cwi6yck,I was thinking that perhaps the people traveled around the island and the DOH is unaware of an exact location they contracted it from. Im assuming they are taking samples of Mosquitos from each area they traveled in for more data. ,HawaiiGardening,cwiuynd,2,t5_38ro7

9079555,0,t3_54jien,Check out church bazaars school fundraisers craft fairs etc. There is often a small for sale plant table. Go early for the good stuff come back before closing for cheap stuff. Volunteer on school or library beautification days or may fair. Sometimes you can take home cuttings if you ask nicely. Watch out for bonsai or orchid shows they have stuff to sell too. Watch Craigslist for moving sales.Always ask first!!!!!! Dont just cut or steal fruit from peoples yards!!!! A lot of people have a business selling their stuff you could be stealing their livelihood. And its not safe or cool to do so and makes people very mad.,HawaiiGardening,d837r43,2,t5_38ro7
9107824,0,t1_d86ljt0,Ive still yet to start vermicomposting. I appreciate you linking this video so I can research more and sharing with me what youre doing and how. I have some old bins and old untreated wood benches under the house I could use. I was thinking about the bamboo biochar and how you could use the uncured vermicompost to inoculate it before applying into the soi. ,HawaiiGardening,d86m43a,2,t5_38ro7
11007763,0,t3_5x5axd,One of my greenhouse panels popped off but the rain was good for all the plants I put in the side yard. I didnt have damage to anything luckily! And the new Vandas on my front tree were totally fine. The fence Ive been complaining about for the last year that my neighbor put up and blocked my view totally blocks my entire patio garden from these winds. A devils bargain I suppose.,HawaiiGardening,defp6gf,3,t5_38ro7
