538560,0,t3_20ajfd,Disclaimer nothing in this post should be taken as a recommendation. Every persons brain chemistry is unique and mine is far further from typical than most. I have done a lot of careful personal experimentation and my casual interest has slowly turned into a neargraduatelevel understanding of neuropharmacology with the time and effort Ive put into it.The part you care about my current favoritespracticesregimen. I have four different stimulants that I cycle for the workweek. Generally Nuvigil mg pill broken in half taken before breakfast and lunch gets two days of the week CTMP gets one or two days per week mg first thing in the morning Adderall XR gets one or two days per week mg spaced out over the day swallowing chewing or intranasal and caffeine gets one or zero days per week mg!!! drunk in two or three doses early morning and early afternoon. I also take magnesium glycinate on a daily basis really helps with the bruxism that accompany stimulants choline in the form of sunflower lecithin Vitamin D sulbutiamine SAMe extra potassium salt substitute in my water tums with Adderall and occasionally Noopept with the Adderall as well.I use light therapy every morning that Im able propranolol mg if Im feeling a bit jittery and not enjoying it and etizolam to go to sleep if I simply am not tired not more than once per week.Glutenfree is huge. HUGE. Not celiacstrict but seriously just try it. I also dont use alcohol very much anymore Im so intune with the way my brain and body feel alcohol just feels like a poison these days. Exercise helps a lot as well.Further disclaimer CTMP is an incredibly powerful chemical requires actual single milligram control over dosing and is not to be taken lightly. Ive given test doses to my friends and nobody can tolerate more than mg but that mg will give them  hours of insane productivity. If you need any more convincing to be careful it will allow your muscles to exceed their capabilities puts your autonomic nervous system right at the edge of fight or flight so if you attempt some physical activity gym sports etc you will perform like you never have before and then likely be injured for days or weeks. Didnt believe this until I learned it the hard way.When I was first diagnosed doc tried me on typical dosages of adderall and ritalin...didnt have any noticeable effect even when we doubled and then quadrupled the dosage.Luckily modafinil had just come out onto the market so he was happy to prescribe me Provigil. Absolute lifesaver. Wouldnt have survived college without it. Provigil was good for helping me achieve functionality but it had some serious drawbacks in the amounts that I needed to take it daily the headaches anxiety stomach butterflies utter lack of appetite and bruxism were fierce. The intended effect still outweighed the side effects but not by a whole lot.Then Nuvigil arrived on the market and he immediately prescribed me the newer stuff. Love it even more. The intended effects are longer and smoother with proportionally far less side effects. Bruxism is still an issue nightguard at night gum during the daytime appetite reduction will always be there but the headaches have largely disappeared and anxiety is only barely perceptibly above baseline and I have other drugs to deal with that on whenever I want basis such as propranolol.However after a stressful job with insane hours new girlfriend and some creeping alcoholism my required dose of Nuvigil started to slowly increase and I realized I wasnt happy in my life so I quit my job and experimented with my brain and lifestyle for the better part of a year. After I felt happy again reconnected with myself and was satisfied with the experimentationabsolutely chomping at the bit for work I got a new awesome job which Im several months into. The section below the disclaimer is what I currently do although Im iterating all the time.

Im thankful I dont have to go through insurance companies etc. as far as sleep studies and medication go. Alternatives to sleep studies are lumbar puncture and just simple old fashioned sleep diaries as evidence. Ive had the lumbar puncture and it was too unpleasant for me for the doctor to actually fully complete the procedure. Im sure if you argued your case youd get some kind of prescription or medication. Whether or not you have narcolepsy is mostly irrelevant. Its just the name given to a set of symptoms.

I was kind of like you didnt move to much or snore much at all did wake up a bunch didnt have any breathing issues and pretty much jumped into REM tho. Because of the last two they kept me for the nap study.

The doc believes that I am having some cataplexy episodes he asked me last time if my knees buckle when I laugh and I thought OMG every time and recently I had two instances where I almost fell completely down but he said that without the two instances of REM he cant diagnose N so my official diagnosis is hypersomnia.

3556234,0,t3_30fl3r,Hiya!Ive been officially diagnosed with N for  years and was diagnosed with sleep apnea and given a CPAP to test out for  days.  My case of apnea is somewhat mild so I was able to opt for surgery on my tonsils and sinuses instead of having to use a machine Im an incredibly light sleeper and it kept me awake.  By the way if youve considered getting that surgery I recommend it . It definitely changed my QOL for the better in a very unexpected way.Anyhow when I took my sleep study I had an overnight portion where they identified I had apnea and the next day had my MSLT where they identified I had Narcolepsy.

Try and get another sleep study done. A week before do not exercise no caffeine nothing in your system that will throw off the results.If you can get a diagnosis head to your disability office so you can receive accommodations.And the reality is no matter how many stimulants you take you have to get medication that will give you restorative sleep that is the root of the problem.Im not a doctor but for me if not xyrem phenibut ashwaghanda  taurine work at about  efficiency off xyrem.

6470887,0,t3_444cs9,To answer your title question... Yeah I think you are wrong... And I also dont mean to be judgmental but what you describe in your post and what you describe in the comments are kind of in conflict with each other. You might be holding it together right now but I doubt its going to last. Theres a reason that the meth in a pill that the doctors prescribe is formulated the way it is... Ultimately it is to treat your symptoms without getting you high. With many drugs keeping below that threshold mitigates addiction. Maybe thats possible with methI dont really knowbut it doesnt really sound like youre doing it regardless.Myself Im really careful to not even take an extra pill occasionally to compensate for lifestyle i.e. I have bad sleep habits that bite  me in the ass at times because theres a really fine balance that can get really easily tipped into a a selfreinforcing cycle of dependence. Already Im cycling through drugs every year or so because of tolerance issues and I want to try and keep that in check.From what youve written it doesnt sound to me like youre keeping that balance as well as you think and although it sounds like youre highly functional now I dont hold out a lot of hope that youll stay that way.To he honest  years does not sound like a long time to me... Do you still think youll have it under control when youre ? Or ? Even if you dont escalate your usage over that time  unlikely cause this class of drugs develops tolerance really well  and you can maintain it over  or  years seems SO unlikely! do you really think you wont be seeing the effects of chronic use?And things that you mention... The trashed apartment an car alienated friends... All sound like classic signs of a problem to me.I wish you the bestI definitely know what youre feeling plus I have another  years of it on you. I joke about taking meth on a weekly basis... Maybe youll be able to manage meth. But youd be the first! Do you think you have it in you to accomplish what no one else in the world has done?Think of the long game man... Its not easy but it is possible to have a good and satisfying life with a sleep disorder. Lots of people do it and lots of them are here!

7786348,0,t1_d3r5h3x,I understand your point but I think that is splitting hairs.  The definitions of sleepiness and tiredness are nearly the same thing the definition of tired in part is being sleepy.  Regardless I think this somewhat proves my point.  Is  the likelihood of falling asleep the only relevant factor when screening for EDS?  To quote Wikipedia I know not the best source people with EDSgt are compelled to nap repeatedly during the day fighting off increasingly strong urges to sleep during inappropriate times such as while driving while at work during a meal or in conversations. As the compulsion to sleep intensifies the ability to complete tasks sharply diminishes often mimicking the appearance of intoxication.  There surely is a difference between the urge to napsleep and actually falling asleep.  Otherwise you would HAVE to fall asleep at inappropriate times to have EDS right?  Doesnt the definition of EDS with the third word being sleepiness prove that sleepiness is more than just the likelihood someone will fall asleep?  IMO it just seems like justifying the ESS by saying it only measures sleepiness as the likelihood one will fall asleep is a cop out.  And even if that is the only goal and it does it well which very well may be the case isnt there a huge part of the analysis missing?  How could a physician justify prescribing CNS stimulants for NEDS based upon a very low ESS score like mine if that wasnt the case?I know it is imperfect but it seems like there is a lot more missing compared to the information the ESS provides.  Sorry if I am changing my argument slightly but I still do not think the ESS has a sufficient role in diagnosing EDS andor sleep conditions.  I am probably also splitting hairs as much as I said you were.Thanks for the reply!,Narcolepsy,d3r8pjh,-1,t5_2rhx3
7981488,0,t3_4ojq12,YES!!! I have asked multiple sleep doctors about this and they all act like Im crazy! My wife notices it the most because shell try cuddling me at night but then once Im falling asleep she has to bail because I heat up like a furnace.

8916783,0,t3_526zx9,I have very vivid dreams  and often if I dont have to be awake I prefer to attempt to go back to the dream I was having if I wake up than get up and start my day.  Usually they fade from my memory quickly  within minutes  but are very much like watching a well filmed movie while they do occur.  I rarely am me in them  just a character or an observer.  Last night was one about zombies  but had some interesting twists and turns involved.  Perhaps because they dont involve me often  I rarely wake up frightened even if they are scary.  When they do involve me  or people I know  I can struggle to figure out if its a memory that was real  or a dream.,Narcolepsy,d7jo0jl,2,t5_2rhx3
8968931,0,t1_d7pp7yl,gt Over and over again people say and research supports the fact that the emotionalpsychosocial burden of having N and IH is the same is as bad as  if not worse than  the actual sleepiness. I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone with NIH to seek therapy.I definitely feel like this sometimes. In class yesterday someone came to talk and one of the faculty here had worked with the speaker. She mentioned that in the old days to do this experiment the speaker had to get up every  hours in the middle of the night to refocus a microscope for live imaging so he would sleep on a leather couch in the lab. And she said so dont whine! Seemed to be a jab at millenials because you know no one sleep deprives themselves for experiments anymore. Id rather wake up every  hours than have to stay completely alert for  hours straight during the day. Anytime plz...That made me severely angry luckily I forgot about it after a couple of hours.,Narcolepsy,d7pxh9g,2,t5_2rhx3
8974561,0,t3_5343mo,I was first diagnosed with IH after my sleep study didnt go into REM sleep during the naps. My doctor told me its very common for subsequent sleep studies to show REM sleep in the naps and my diagnosis could change to narcolepsy later. Since the treatments are the same he actually switched my diagnosis to narcolepsy due to problems with insurance there are no official treatments for IH but there are for narcolepsy.Side note  I also do not fall asleep without laying down. I have excessive daytime sleepiness and never feel rested after waking. I always thought of my sleep attacks as drowsy spells.There is some research being done that suggests that some people with IH have extra GABA in their cerebral spinal fluid I think its something like this basically having the effect of a sleeping pill. My personal belief is that there are a couple different manifestations of IH that may one day be their own classified sleep disorders.Edit added link,Narcolepsy,d7qlu8t,5,t5_2rhx3

10005991,0,t1_dbbsol7,I dont feel  but I feel much better than I did before Xyrem. Before I had a disability accommodation at work so that I could sit rather than standing in place all day. Otherwise I got so tired that I felt like I could just sleep right on the floor. Now I can stand all day without an issue.I plan on returning to caffeine. My tolerance is so high with that stuff so it doesnt do anything. I was just taking it to feel normal. So a couple months coffee free should do me some good. Also I stopped Kratom. I wanna reset my tolerance for that stimulant as well. Or maybe I should just ask my sleep doc for some meth. Heh yeah right. But as long as youre not doing them debil plants like Marijuana right?!,Narcolepsy,dbbt5k3,1,t5_2rhx3
10022276,0,t3_5j2b71,Ive found that it is a bit similar to when I have a sore throat and Im sick but I dont look sick. I literally get to lab and tell someone I have a sore throat and then they start talking to me. Like expecting a response. And when I talk to them on facebook when we are in the same room they literally said but Im right here! Why dont you just talk to me?!If they cant see it it doesnt exist basically. Which is completely ridiculous but thats how the majority of the population works currently. I think I get a bit better reception when I say its similar to having insomnia and being really tired but instead you sleep  hours because I think a lot of people have experienced insomnia at least more than EDS.  Its funny to me that my dad is a workaholic and when I was a kid my dad would come home and my mom would say hes really tired! whenever he fell asleep downstairs. But in the summer in high school when I slept  hours a day I was called lazy by him! I think its also just a perception problem. People assume that all sleep is the same how would you not be refreshed after sleeping? It makes sense to most people that if youve only slept for  hours for a few days that you would be tired! But if you sleep  hours they just cant fathom how you would still be sleepy as they think the sleep they have is the same as the sleep everyone else has.I weirdly get more empathy when I say yea I have sleep paralysis at least once a month if not more and I have terrible dreams if I watch any scary movies or creepy shows before I go to bed. Somehow that makes it worse than being tired after sleeping  hours.What Im saying is people are idiots and dont understand sleep or that some peoples brains and bodies might not sleep correctly. Which is really depressing.,Narcolepsy,dbdxi6s,3,t5_2rhx3

10348115,0,t1_dcgga0u,A lot of people have suggested writingmaking phone calls but Im just hesitant to think that could help... The republican party has become obsessed with getting rid of the ACA at all costs and only a handful seem concerned with a decent replacement plan. And even if they do replace it eventually Im going to end up with a pre existing condition because I wont be able to maintain coverage. I just hope they keep some of their promises and dont completely screw over the little guy  I know the ACA isnt perfect like you said but its done a LOT of good for average American families like mine. If I was left with no choice I could probably push myself to working full time but it wouldnt be pleasant and I definitely wouldnt be able to do anything with my day. I dont respond super well to medication as is and napping has a high chance of making me feel even more tired even if its a  minute one.

10749861,0,t3_5ts66c,I have narcolepsy as a secondary immune response to a genetic disease that has over  symptoms and can cause hundreds of complications and secondary conditions. Sometimes separating symptoms isnt always the best way to approach it. Try to evaluate what your everyday is like. If everyday your at a  on a scale from  in EDS but three days a week its a  and you have other symptoms on those days its definitely a curiosity worth anything good doctors time. The other thing is that MLST and sleep studies in general can reveal quite a bit about what an active disease does to your sleep cycle. Its worth going to the doctor about if you dont have a diagnosis. I was asked if I had chiari at my sleep doctors however I cant say for certain if this was because of my narcolepsy or because of my primary disease that causes many spinal manifestations to occur over time.Good luck ,Narcolepsy,ddorkww,2,t5_2rhx3

It doesnt sound attractive at all  it knocks you out into a sleep SO strong it can be used as a date rape drug and it cant be mixed with alcohol.
