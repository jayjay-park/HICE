10416381,0,t1_dcmabfr,People always bash IPGuys on quality but we should all be honest. With the prices we are paying I would rather have stability and something to watch rather than constant freezing skipping. ,iptvgta,dcorjmh,1,t5_3e45w
10569974,0,t1_dd66sew,I agree with you the t epg is fairly modern looking. I like it. That said Im actually us using the avov tvo right now and the epg isnt as modern but its probably nd place. But I like other features of avov. They are close! I hope to have one in a few days.   I have a few busy days ahead of me but soon hopefully! ,iptvgta,dd67k45,1,t5_3e45w

11426337,0,t1_dfq8fwa,I have an ABOX A running the STBEmu setup with ipguys package and so far no problems what so ever. Im extremely happy so far. Live TV is perfect. I can see how improvements can be made but Im extremely happy. Even the video game emulators work awesome with my ps remote linked up. CP works flawlessly. Watched a leaf game and it lagged for a moment then not again. Its clear as can be expected. Sound is good. Interface is standard. I watched the reviews I believe you posted and I compared to what I saw there... I think I am satisfied with it. Best part because I ordered the box on Prime I can return without questions if problems arise. For sure Im paying too much but I got excited and too the first guy I found lol But ill be switching to a more reasonable provider at the end of my month. Only got one. Also maybe I did it wrong but I PMd you and didnt get a reply. Did I mess up the message somehow? s ABOX A  ,iptvgta,dfr5wh9,1,t5_3e45w
