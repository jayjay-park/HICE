363134,0,t3_1y90qs,Looks nice! I assume it locks open somehow? I wonder if you could add a folded over fin like on the BD model? This would work for softer snow purchase and could also be the handle used to open the blade put a divot in the handle big enough for a gloved finger.I also like to use the bladetop of the pole as a high grip when touring its quicker then adjusting pole length when you need a bit more length either in cane or dagger ice axe grip. The folded over bit on bd blades is nice for this and also maybe a more bulbousrounded off the top of the pole that is easier to grip with gloves on. ,Backcountry,cfiekn8,2,t5_2sa05

905763,0,t1_ch77vst,Yeah boots make a big difference and dynafits are just amazing...you could loose several bounds off each foot just doing that. Even going from an old touring boot like the scarpa spirt to a lighter one with more range of motion like the maestrale made a big difference for me.I think the zealots are pretty heavy too compared to the charger or similar?,Backcountry,ch78oig,1,t5_2sa05

3770903,0,t3_33lnut,Thanks for the comments so far. The question was geared towards finding out other peoples routine and process of checking the forecast  whether they just skim read the bulletin looking at the danger ratings or if they actually read the whole thing.Im also in the latter category in that I read the whole thing having done my AST course a couple of years back.,Backcountry,cqm3zp1,2,t5_2sa05
4468598,0,t3_3c99dz,For your first set of AT bindings I would ignore all the suggestions to look into tech bindings. If you are looking for something that is going to shred in bounds hard as well ares have the ability to tour in the baron is a good option. It was my first set of AT bindings however bindings like this do add quite a bit of weight which is not a huge issue if you are doing short tours but anything more than a  couple of kilometers you really start to notice the weight. Other bindings to look into would be the are the salomon guardian and atomic tracker which are essentially the exact same binding. Noticeable differences between the marker at bindings and the atomicsalomon bindings is that with the markers you have to remove your boot from the binding to swap from ski to hike mode which I found to be a huge inconvenience when you are in deep snow. The salomonatomics  can be swapped from hike to ride without removing your boot. But the heel riser system on the markers is slightly easier to raise and lower with a ski pole than the atomicssalomons.  Personally I liked my barons but my ski shop definitely sells more salomons and gets better reviews just due to the fact that it is an aluminum frame and feels a lot more sturdy than the markers. ,Backcountry,cstxxdg,2,t5_2sa05
5302513,0,t1_cvp5zt2,Sometimes I dont carry a shovel when I ski alone. But then I think what if I saw someone else get buried just by coincidence and couldnt dig them out cause I didnt have a shovel? Id feel like a real jerk. So usually I carry a shovel.,Backcountry,cvpghru,3,t5_2sa05
5628053,0,t3_3ryccw,As a couple of other people mentioned if youre serious about a touring you should think about Dynafit bindings over the Markers. Youd be surprised how easier your life will be in the backcountry with lighter and more efficient bindings and boots.,Backcountry,cwuppfu,2,t5_2sa05

6545997,0,t3_453br0,The best introduction ski tour is the Musical Bumps area behind Whistler Mountain as mentioned by pfunkman. If you buy the Backcountry pass around tax it will give you an easy access to the top of Whistler Mountain vie Peak Chair or Harmony Express from there it is an easy ski via Burnt Stew Trail to the col between Picollo and Flute summits and then an easy skin to Flute Summit and over to Oboe drainage if the Symphony Lift is open you can take that but we usually dont wait for it to open. Oboe has great skiing the lower half is sheltered from wind. Check the Google Earth screenshots at the end of this albumIf you have time and energy hop over to Singing Pass for more great terrain. If you have lots of energy and start early you can skin up to the pass via the Singing Pass trail  hours from Whistler village.The terrain behind Blackcomb is a bit more advanced and there is a lot to choose from but it is a pain in the ass to access without splurging on the Backcountry pass. Unlike the Whistler side there is no official trail access and anyway skinning from the valley does not make sense for day trips.Do get the Baldwin map he has one for Duffey Lake Road as well Lazy Boy on Cayoosh Mountain and Equinox on Mount Chief Pascall are in my view the easiest objectives with the least amount of kickturns.Have fun.,Backcountry,czweqtk,2,t5_2sa05

7379174,0,t1_d2gxtfw,Here is the view from the Southern aspect we rode down for our first run looking at the ridge again. If you zoom in you can see relativley where we were in the middle of that big field and then the ridgeline with the more open less rocky bowl on the right which would be out of frame in the original picture.We saw people ripping that face on our way up. I didnt feel comfortable and I was tired to keep going as it was close to noon then and temps were already near F at k feet.Like I said Im pretty new to this but my training and common sense tell me that is a bad situation to be in.,Backcountry,d2gylvq,1,t5_2sa05

9613883,0,t1_d9y1qq8,I disagree about all tech bindings being the same. There are some major differences especially when you get into strippeddown race bindings. The three brands hes looking at are about as different as it gets right now in tech bindings IMO.As for Vipec having a nicer release what makes it nicer? I think theres a lot of marketing that goes into selling their proprietary toe release mechanism but that neglects the fact that toe release has a blind spot that heel release does not and viceversa. IIRC lateral release in the heel can prevent one etiology of knee injury while lateral release in the toe can prevent another. Short of having some weird hybrid that can laterally release at toe AND heel I wouldnt claim superiority for one scheme over another. No tech binding in existence currently solves this theoretical problem.,Backcountry,d9y3x3g,1,t5_2sa05
9641695,0,t1_d9zlhg6,To add to this if you do decide to go for the splitboard which is ultimately my recommendation if thats what you are more comfortable going down hill on get crampons for your splitboard.There may be times when you ski buddies can handle an icy traverse but you simply wont have the edgehold necessary. crampons will help in a lot of situations. Also a large voile strap around your boot cuff and binding highback helps with edgehold.,Backcountry,da1jd0e,2,t5_2sa05
10152316,0,t1_dbun478,I mean if you bring something it can always break on you. So how important is it? Does it need to be fixed? For my splitboard I carry extra screws and straps. Extra laces for my boots. Tools to fix every part of my hardware. Voile straps to fix a number of things but I used one the other day when my tail clip broke on me. Tape to fix ripped pants or coats or gloves. All that and its pretty small and light so I dont mind carrying repair gear. For skis I know bailing wire is pretty popular to rig some bindings but Im not familiar enough with the binding to know the particulars. You can always ask more experienced people what in their experience has broken on them and how they fixed it. ,Backcountry,dbutkcf,1,t5_2sa05
10453284,0,t1_dcsqgjz,Maestrale is a great boot...I had a pair before my tlt. Id opt for the RS model though i am really excited about next years version which drops some weight I think the kingpin has  mm of length adjustability so you should be able to get by changing boots without a remount though the boot center may change position a bit.You can look up Boot Sole Length BSLs here. Boots like the tlt tend to be a bit short but i expect vlucans or maestrales are just a few mm off from your old boots in similar shell sizes,Backcountry,dcszd31,2,t5_2sa05
