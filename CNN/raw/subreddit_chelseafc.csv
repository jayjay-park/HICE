He had  goals and  assists in a league that has  of the top teams on the planet.I saw the same shit when we signed Ramires and on his performances in the first half of the season. Not on reddit because I wasnt here back then but a general consensus among online Chelsea fans. Also the same shit on Piazon  seasons back claiming hes just an average talent. I remember so many fans wanting Drogba out after his nd season here because of various idiotic reasons.

81029,0,t1_cenmx22,Not really we sold a young player in a position we were loaded and had many promising prospects for an extremely talented young David Luiz who had potential to be the best in the world at a position we were in need.  So that young player developed and became what we need it was a gamble and now we buy him just like we would of bought any other player.  No more of a mistake than if he had never developed and we were buying some other great young midfielder.Same goes for KDB he is a young talent but at a position we are loaded.  We sell him to buy Matic.

Who knows what would happen if Mata stays with us and risk it maybe he can fit in maybe not. He doesnt want to take it which is understandable and fine with me.

304161,0,t1_cfc2s36,Responses like these really fucking piss me off. Firstly football is still in its adolescent stage in regards to popularity in the States and its  not mind blowing that new fans will be attracted to the already prominent teams. This happens for a variety of reason but is so blatantly obvious that I dont think more needs to be said about it. What upsets me is the propagation of this idea that all Americans are to use your terminology glory supporters. Even if that were the case would it be so shocking?The United States is about six times the population of England with a land area that is approximately  times larger. Oh and like three thousand miles of ocean in between. Part of the appeal of English football is the large number of teams in close proximity to each other which allows rivalries to blossom. Talking specifically about English football I imagine that most local supporters are simply born into their fandom and experience these intense rivalries from a young age. Clearly this type of imprinting is much more rare when you never get a chance to watch a game in person. As a result we have fans whose allegiance has been determined in a wide variety of ways.So fine there is some small fraction of the population that are not true fans and we as smart individuals are able to understand how this could happen. You take things a step farther when you start talking about sports rooted in OUR culture and continue to misrepresent the facts. We are a sporting nation. We have diehard fans of all shapes and sizes. Just because in your personal life you know a couple people who have switched allegiance doesnt mean we need to label the entire country. Americans get a bad rap for all sorts of shit internationally and its not going away anytime soon. Is it too much to ask for one of our own to say something positive?. We all know there is a large foreign interest on this sub as confirmed by our recent poll and Im getting tired of this idiot American vibe going around.I apologize if this comes off as a personal attack towards you. I just want people to know the large majority of us are in fact true fans.,chelseafc,cfcakij,6,t5_2rsl6

452559,0,t3_1z9j2i,On  October  Chelsea Football Club made a proposal to buy back the freehold land owned by CPO on which the football stadium at Stamford Bridge sits which would pave the way for a move to a new ground. Chelsea Chairman Bruce Buck said Chelsea should always be grateful to those who invested in CPO. We know only too well how close the club came to losing our home prior to the formation of CPO but that threat has now gone under Mr Abramovichs ownership and with the CPO structure in place we cannot plan with certainty for the future. I hope all shareholders vote in favour of the proposal.The proposal was brought in a general CPO meeting on  October  but failed to pass as only . of the total votes were cast in favour of the proposal below the  minimum requirement.In May  Chelsea Football Club confirmed that they had lodged a bid to buy the site of Battersea Power Station with the possibility of the club relocating to a seater capacity stadium. Chairman Bruce Buck did concede that there were a number of hurdles to jump including winning the support of our fans the CPO shareholders and local Wandsworth residents near the Battersea site as well as securing the approval of Wandsworth Council the Greater London Authority and heritage authorities.Kind of why we havent really pushed moving as of yet. ,chelseafc,cfrpdoh,8,t5_2rsl6

862039,0,t1_ch1tgjg,Yes there still is too and dont think this is my antiJose views coming in.The loss to Sunderland followed by a loss against Atletico would have been deadly for Mourinho and its probably why he hasnt been in the press lately. Liverpool is on Sunday and then Atletico is  days later.Had we lost in the Champions League game with us also losing on Sunday Mourinho would have had  straight losses and to any other club thats fine but not with us. Dont be fooled into thinking Roman has changed his ways he hasnt and he never will.I dont know how many losses or lack of wins it is but he would have been very close to getting the axe and he still is to an extent if we cant beat or at least draw to Norwich or Cardiff.If it was.L L L L L  Hed be sacked no doubt but luckily for him it isnt even L L L W D could get him sacked.If we lose to Liverpool Atletico and then lose to Norwich andor Cardiff.. He has a good change of being sacked as its the end of the Season.Yeah I know you dislike honesty but thats the cold hard truth. For comparison.RDMs last  games.  W L L W L.Ancelotti.

1207976,0,t3_27xxyf,gt Chelsea are in talks with Valencia about the possible transfer of Chelsea prepare to offload John Obi Mikel and Ramires and have asked Real Madrid that Luka Modric be included in any proposed deal for Ramires. gt The west London club tried to sell Mikel  to Galatasaray last summer but the Nigeria midfielder did not want to move. He has three years left on his contract but the arrival of Nemanja Matic in January and Marco van Ginkels recovery from a knee injury have paved the way for his departure. gt Valencia who were purchased this week by Peter Lim the Singaporean billionaire are looking to bolster their defensive options and have turned to Mikel now that their pursuit of Cheikhou Kouyat has been ended by the defenders expected move to West Ham United. The Spanish club are also looking at Nani the Manchester United winger who signed a fiveyear contract at Old Trafford in September. gt Mikel made just  league starts and a further  appearances from the substitutes bench last season. He cost Chelsea about  million in  after Manchester United complained that they had an agreement to buy him first from Lyn Oslo. gt Real have asked about signing Ramires who cost Chelsea about  million but are unlikely to allow Modric to depart. gt Tomas Kalas has joined Cologne who have been promoted back to the top flight in Germany on loan . The defender  made his debut in the  win away to Liverpool in April and started in the last match of the season. He has also made one appearance for the Czech Republic. ,chelseafc,ci5ikn2,14,t5_2rsl6

1383818,0,t1_cipfqgi,Thats not at all true. In a v sprint without the ball Ivanovic can keep pace with almost everyone. This is why this criticism of him is getting ridiculous. Hes not got the technical ability to go forward at pace with the ball but hes damn quick. Combined with his usually good positioning he will almost never be beaten down his side unless an overlap is involved. Combined with the fact that his crossing is actually underrated and we lack a striker who makes near post runs like Giroud or somebody better.Why do you think there was a period last season where all he did was tap it round opposing full backs and sprint past them. Thats not a random thing the coaches obviously had confidence he could go round those players. I distinctly remember him taking it past quite a few midfielders on a break against basel too. Its not that he cant do it reasonably regularly but that hes much more defensively disciplined.I mean Ivanovic had better attacking and defensive stats than Bosingwa who was our last attacking Rb although theyre not even in the same class really. Dave is a special case really because hes probably the best RB in the country. Hes quick for any position. Bran is quick for a defender. Hes certainly quick for his size which is a definite plus and gives you all kinds of extra options from set pieces. Dave is better at picking a pass for a cross rather than driving to the byline and turning back. Hes also much much more comfortable running with the ball when there are players in front of him. Against Ronaldo youd probably want Dave hes quick enough strong enough and often reads the play well enough to exploit the space behind whereas Bran will just want to drive into space thats in front of him on a counter. Saying that both of them clearly have the discipline to know when to offload the ball. The only actually slow member of our defence is Terry. Bran is more than capable of dealing with pretty much every winger in the PL. I cant think of more than  he struggles with. Some wingers can shift it past him but thats just down to acceleration and usually size but thats where his positioning is usually spot on. ,chelseafc,cipqts5,1,t5_2rsl6

1460652,0,t1_ciz6ox3,Do you realize that a strikers type is dependent on what abilities they posess? Of course I read the article and hes clearly dicussing the ways in which he has improved. He believes he has added abilities to his game such as playing with his back to goal. He comes to the conclusion that he possess all relevant striking abilities which to anyone who has seen him play more than a few games is blatantly flase. He possess great athleticism and is a decent finisher but his backtogoal play still needs work despite what he thinks his movement needs significant improvement  and his technique is subpar. Without these attributes and more he is not close to being a complete striker however you want to slice the semantic of types and abilities.By only commenting on Lukakus motivations you have ignored the clubs. I dont even disagree with you on them but to answer the OP its useful to talk about what the club want and feel as well.

1568572,0,t3_2c65on,Heres a rant a friend sent meThe whole thing is embarrassing. Wed better have a very good season this year as that is the only way the Chelsea hierarchy especially Jose will redeem themselves. A lot of Chelsea fans are scratching their heads trying to make sense of some of the deals we have done recently and the way in which the club doesnt give its academy youth a chance to make it to the first team. To the rest of the football fraternity we are just a laughing stock. Sure it made sense for us to bring Matic back to the club but forking out m for him proves that we were wrong to let him go in the first place. Letting Ashley Cole go makes no sense and then we go out and spend m to replace him. Bringing in Fabregas and at m makes little sense to me. There are enough first team midfielders and kids on the fringes Chalobah Ake etc who could do the job. Weve now put all our faith in Costa who though a top player is unproven in the Premiership. God help us if he crocs or flops. And in the midst of all that we bring back a yr old Drogba bearing in mind that Jose made a derogatory comment about Etoos age last season. Drogs was a good player for us during his first spell he definitely isnt our greatest player ever  some of us have long memories numerous games where he just wasnt interested and practically sabotaged the teams efforts to overcome its opponents but he is probably past it now. And then weve got Torres who continues to be clueless in front of goal. It seems to me that Lukaku should have been given his chance. With the right support HE could easily have turned out to be our greatest player ever. Yes he may have an attitude but at worst it is only a function of his youth. More likely it is out of his frustration from not being given his chance at Chelsea. His comment yesterday that he has the trust of the players and staff at Everton and therefore feels at home there was a passing shot in Chelseas direction and well justified in my opinion. I just hope we havent burned our bridges with him. More importantly I hope the terms of the sale mean that we have first option to buy him back if Everton decide to sell during the term of his five year contract. Either that or at least there is a sellon clause entitling us to a share of any proceeds in excess of say m should Everton decide to sell. If we havent manoeuvred to do that as an absolute minimum then we are complete and utter mugs. This kid is going to be one of the best strikers in Europe if not the world. His sellon value will be in excess of m in three years time.Rant over.,chelseafc,cjcw6sz,0,t5_2rsl6
1571654,0,t1_cjd7wnr,Well if he does move it will probably have to be soon seeing as if he does stay until hes around  his price value will go up significantly and clubs like Barcelona and Madrid would have to pay a pretty penny for a top goalkeeper. By that time however younger and rising goalies will probably be their priority. Currently Barca have Ter Stegen who is  and will bleed into the squad along with Claudio Bravo  and Madrid are likely to be signing Keylor Navas. ,chelseafc,cjda3ws,2,t5_2rsl6

1614022,0,t3_2csc40,My take... pure speculation.Most of the Liverpool pundits are from when Liverpool were really successful in the s making their British players household names. TV pundits tend to be selected by their reputation and nationality over actual analytical ability hence we get the likes of Shearer Lawrenson Ferdinand Sounness etc.despite their inane insight.Chelsea werent especially popular until around the late s where some well known players arrived but from abroad. We had the likes of Wise and Le Saux but Wise has a bad reputation and Le Saux was stigmatised basically because he was middle class and educated more on that later?Perhaps in the future well see a few more pundits add to the occasional gigs from Nevin Gullit and Wilkins. It seems likely to be after the recent surge in populalirity. You can currently observe how Man Utds retiring players from the s and s are beginning to replace the older lot from s Liverpools. Today Ferdinand and P. Neville have been announced for MotD in England G. Nevilles been at Sky.Without the easy pundit job on the table after retiring from playing I think a lot of players go into coaching to remain in the game. I also think that the British working class of the past has stigmatised higher education Le Saux getting called homosexual for reading a broadsheet etc and as a result can find it harder than their European peers at transitioning into management. Hopefully this changes at some point because England has a real problem with quality coaches.,chelseafc,cjim4f9,6,t5_2rsl6

2267099,0,t1_clrw6ys,Yeah Hasselbaink just never seemed to come up. Looking at his career now he was quite the player. I think the reason he never really came up was due to the fact that Chelsea was the biggest team he played for since leeds isnt much of a team anymore. He killed it at a relegated Atletico and the rest of the teams werent too big. That and the fact that he only played for the Netherlands for  years. Lamps has always been a great. I honestly feel he put in a good shift last season as well and was always excited to see him starting. One problem is that it is easy to analyze an attacking player like Lamps or even a defender than a player playing the Makelele role. How was Makelele in his first year.

2290751,0,t3_2lh2c4,The studentstanding sections in college stadiums is what makes the environment the best atmosphere of any sport in America. Ive been to games at my hometowns college where no students go to games because the team sucks and you can hear the coaches and players on the field all the way from the upper deck. Dead quiet. Look at a place like Texas AampM where they subsidize half the stadiums tickets for students to go to the game for free or very low cost. Insane atmosphere. Problem is the reason colleges get to sell k student tickets for  each is because they dont quite have the wage bill that a professional organization like Chelsea has. Their only overhead comes with facility upkeep facility staff the coaching staff and then housing and general expenses for the players. These are college kids that are amateur athletes who arent getting paid anything. Thats another big discussion for another time and place. Point is they can afford to give up revenue in exchange for atmosphere when they arent paying top players k a week. NFL atmospheres are generally shit because players make millions and tickets cost  for nosebleeds. Chelsea probably could subsidize but not to the extent that big college football programs do in the US. Chelsea are a business and the execs sure do like their money. If the league allowed safe standing and Chelsea lowered the ticket prices a bit for those spots and then put tourists in the east or west stand instead of the ends I think the atmosphere would be really good.

2516623,0,t3_2ogmmj,I think three main things contributed to the loss. Mikels poor challenge that led to the build up play of second goal.. Cahill suffering a possible head injury and completely botching the block on the cross for the first goal. Commentator even said thats his second knock recently and honestly theres a good chance he may have had a concussion. The way he went into the block isnt really typical of how Cahill does things...he seemed a bit off.. Willian being to complacent in the final third and not clinical enough with his chances....I think if anyone needs to take a step back its him....Hes a workhorse but I slowly see his role being looked at the in the transfer market to really make Chelsea a world class team. Hes about and  out of  but Oscar Hazard Matic Cesc and Costa are all a class above. Upgrade him and use the money to buy someone with a little more imagination and technique. ,chelseafc,cmn26vj,-1,t5_2rsl6

2714817,0,t1_cnc8h3z,Absolutely not. He was not worth the M that was paid for him. Im sorry but a winger who just runs and has amazing workrate is not chelsea quality. He is basically Ramires . with better technique. You need to watch him when he plays for Chelsea does fuck all in attack. His performance against Tottenham was frankly pathetic. I dont think we had a single attack coming from his side. He didnt even help plug the holes left by Ivanovic with his phenomenal workrate. Watch him stop tracking Rose.I know it was not his fault on the goal but he certainly is faster then Rose and couldve done better.gtSure hes no Hazard but he fills a role that the team needs him to.No he doesnt. We are toothless if Hazard is marked by  or more players. He needs to offer more in offense. Cut the running around like a headless chicken crap.,chelseafc,cncnwvb,6,t5_2rsl6

There is simply too much talent around the world for him to take a spot here. He was an impulse buy after the unexpected departure of Mata and KDB. He really was never at the level we needed him to be less of his fault and more a fault on our own part. He was completely overly estimated. I actually posted this the day we signed him if you look at his record at Basel in the Swiss leagues of all places it really isnt even that impressive. At most he could have been a useful purchase for a midtable EPL squad.,chelseafc,cnqg0nj,-1,t5_2rsl6
2836197,0,t1_cnqgk01,gt You really think you know better than Jose? He said this year would be his break out year.I think you are contradicted yourself here mate. In the exact thread that was posted here the day Mourinho said this I wrote a comment outlining why I thought he was wrong and that Salah just was not anywhere near the level for him to have a breakout season. In fact I believed he would be lucky to even play on a semiregular basis.I hate how people here use this stupid excuse about you think you know more than Mourinho?. Just because he is Mourinho doesnt make every thing or action he makes correct. And he was obviously wrong in this instance. When David Cameron makes a statement or a decision and you disagree should you be constantly told You think you know more than Cameron?. Its an excuse people use when they have nothing else to say.Also on Salahs record. It really wasnt anything impressive. He wasnt even that prolific of a player for Swiss standards let alone the Premier League. In all his time at Basel in  apps he only scored  goals. For an attacking player who plays in a pretty poor league that is not even close to Chelsea quality. The only reason people on here even said that he had potential is because of the goals he scored against us. Which should never be the sole reason you believe a player is worth buying. If he didnt score against us I cant imagine too many people on here would have hyped him up the way that they did. Which is quite sad because the fact that he scored a couple goals against us should have been a cherry on top not the entire basis of his potential and ability.,chelseafc,cnqh07h,2,t5_2rsl6

The manager you are trying to protect now is always getting booed in his own stadium. And not to mention he is always getting trashed on your own sub by your own fans. The vast majority of Arsenal fans are spineless delusional cunts always changing their views.  It doesnt even take a week. Just few days ago they were singing Wenger out. Why even bother protecting him now? It is funny how you lot always claim you get the toughest fixtures in UCL and you still lost to the team your fans claimed it was an easy fixture.

3367045,0,t1_cpc1wln,No its not hard for me to grasp but thats not the point Im making.  The point Im making is that even though we have a lead we can still lose it.  Its not out of the realm of possibility for us to drop more points just like earlier in the season.  We havent exactly been playing like world beaters if you havent noticed. We also beat Spurs earlier in the year so what point are you trying to make with them honestly? And yes I do remember us just barely beating Liverpool in the semis but a win is a win as long as we win and theres nothing wrong with the tactics as long as we win.  Im aware that this is a results driven game but there have been so many games this year where we have sat back after getting the lead and almost lost it because of it instead of trying to kill the game off.  That point you cannot refute.  And that doesnt come from the players that comes from the manager.  Those are his philosophies that he wants his teams to play like.  And against big teams yes they usually work when playing for the draw but against PSG they didnt work against city they didnt work against atletico last year they didnt work and they sure as hell wont work against Madrid Barcelona or Bayern.   ,chelseafc,cpc2h6o,1,t5_2rsl6

3624247,0,t3_31udae,In order to be great I think this team needs to develop a solid core leadership group of players. Are those players on the team now? FFP will not be a limiting factor this summer. The only limitation is who is available. Can Jose buy leadership and stability in the transfer market? This team is good enough to win domestic and Euro championships now but it needs to develop a leadership core group of players so we dont have another Bradford City or failure to hold a lead up a man at home against PSG. Buying the next shiny superstar wont help us. Terry is presumably the team leader but I dont think he can carry all that water anymore at  and working on one year contracts. Hazard needs to mature still just  and become a true leader on the team. Perhaps Fabregas Matic or Costa can provide some leadership and accountability next year. It is hard to develop team unity when great talents like Oscar Willian and Ramires are looking over their shoulder afraid theyll be replaced every transfer window.,chelseafc,cq5e35c,0,t5_2rsl6

3687744,0,t1_cqcmaom,care to give it some real critique instead of just saying fifa fifa fifa? its essentially what we play already but with Zouma playing instead of fabregas and Ramires over Oscar. Hazard already has a free role but I can see him acting more as a shadowstriker to Remy. Willian will be forced to play deeper because of how effective United have been down their left hand side and im playing Ramires over Oscar for stability. Mourinho probably wont go with this formation as he will probably play a  with Zouma Cesc and Matic in the  with Hazard Willian and Remy up top.people here get way too caught up in specific formations when in reality a proper formation doesnt exist in our game. If Zouma plays he will just be following Fellaini around so theres not much point putting him in a set formation. Willian will inevitably be playing deeper than he normally would so I stuck him next to Matic just for the sake of the diagram. You will all lose your shit because Chelsea dont play  or whatever but at times we very much do play with  blocks of . Ramires will most likely if played tuck in quite a lot to provide a bit of stability and steel to the middle of the park but I put him infront of Dave so that it is symmetrical. Hazard already has a free role so it doesnt matter where I put him in the diagram.,chelseafc,cqcmlhz,4,t5_2rsl6

4326528,0,t1_csdabuw,Youre still missing the point and its getting rather embarrassing. Nobody said he was great. I said he effected big games well but as has been said many of times it was the role that effected the games so well not the player himself which is why somebody should have been brought in to do that role when he left. We did draw or win all our games against the top teams yeah but drew a lot more than we won compared to last season. Take City and Lampards goal for example. That would have been less likely had we had a player in that role next to Matic. United can be another example  Van Persie scored in the th minute and its fair to say Zouma was at fault for it. At this point in the season Zouma hadnt played that role yet and hed barely played any minutes so again having a specific player to do that job could have stopped us dropping  points. Maybe we wouldnt have been destroyed  by Spurswhich is  a big game if we had that type of player. Another thing thats for sure is David Luiz wouldnt have let Sterling bobble through our team and score the equalizer in the Liverpool game. Thats just a couple of examples though.Oh and btw we didnt even lose in the second leg of the Champs League. It was more about the teams game plan and ethos? No because we still tried it with Ramires the odd time with Mikel and a few times with Cesc it just didnt work. You mentioned about him always fouling but Id have been quite happy to see Raheem on the floor instead of almost walking through our team and scoring. Luiz wouldnt have allowed that.,chelseafc,csdbuco,2,t5_2rsl6

4774648,0,t1_ctwcvi3,Its not that he plays in a team that plays well his style of play is effective when there are other players around him who perform well. He will score goals or create chances well when a good link up play is there. He is not the kind of player who runs and creates threats. We have Hazard Willian and Costa to do that. If you see him for all the seasons hes been here youll notice that his skill depends very much on others usually Mata and Hazard playing their part to quite some extent. That does not mean he is a bad player just that his playing style depends on others and Mourinho thinks he needs that kind of a player playing at CAM.

5341109,0,t1_cvucvbr,I think it goes both ways. Most of the team only plays well when Fabregas is good but Fabregas only plays well when everyone else is playing well too. He needs Matic to be doing a good job to cover him the players in front to be making runs into space something that happened less at the end of last season so he looked worse simply because he didnt have the opportunities to make his signature assists and the players behind to cover for gaps he can leave open. With Ivanovic and Matic looking bad and most of the players in front of him looking average theres not much Fabregas can do without being caught out either in front or behind.Chelsea do need a CM but its not just because Fabregas is inconsistent its because the whole system is inconsistent and relies on everyone to be good to be effective. The team needs more depth across the pitch or it needs enough depth to be able to adopt different and more reliable systems but focusing everything on Fabregas being good and the players around him doing well enough to let him be good isnt working often enough.,chelseafc,cvudw1c,7,t5_2rsl6

The only advantage I see Costa having is that provokes defenders more and quite frankly I could do without that.Aguero is a much better player technically though there might be some truth in him not fitting our system as well as Costa which I honestly think is kinda sad.Its so weird to me that Costa seems to be the only player here that nobody criticizes. He has been poor all year yet people still claim that he is world class. Are you guys seeing him play? He constantly loses the ball with sloppy first touches and passes.

5465781,0,t1_cwa0a6c,RLC i think is an almost perfect match to what we need and will help fix our issues in midfield.Fabregas has the passing capabilities to greatly enhance and speed up our built up play but he is shocking defensively and leaves Matic with way too much work leading to our midfield getting overrun in the bigger games.Ramires has the defensive awareness that Fabregas lacks but just isnt good enough on the ball and he gives away too many fouls.This of course leaves us with RLC. Defensively solid  played as a CMD in his youth career and man marked Coutinho out of the game completely last season against Liverpool and another defensively sound performance against West Brom but with composure that a lot of players dont have. He has a knack for manouvering out of tight areas and finding space he uses the ball so cleverly and most importantly he moves it quickly.He seems like the perfect solution he just needs to be given more gametime. I think he should be given a start tomorrow like Mourinho said he would doRamires is defensively solid but I could very well see West Ham pressing us high up the pitch due to our cdms being average on the ball Matic has a wand of a left peg but always having to shift it onto his left limits his passing capabilities and winning the ball in dangerous areasAlso Payet is a fantastic player and I feel he is too tricky for Ramires. Ramires like to lunge into tackles and most of the time it pays off but against someone of Payets caliber itll be too easy for him to draw fouls or just dribble past. Ramires could get a yellow early on and be hamstrung for the rest of the match,chelseafc,cwaazuu,5,t5_2rsl6

We didnt scratch the money that came in from our winnings and the yokohama deal. its a rough time now but if going trophyless now and getting the right signings for him to go another season is possible then i think we should keep him. the truth is no matter who it is Mourinho or someone else new players will be bought in in the summer so why not keep Mourinho? he has every chance of winning trophies with this team no less than anyone else. our performances are improving and i dont think well be in this state for the whole of the season under Mourinho let alone the future for however long he chooses to stay.

5544730,0,t3_3r2nuz,I really love Jose but every one seems to be blinded by the trophies he has won for us. Not once has Jose blamed himself at least publicly for what is going on he is the manager and he has his responsibilities. The players are clearly failing him and the board obviously failed him aswell during the summer but we need to ask ourselves a truly honest question why are the same players who played for Jose last year and adapted to his nd half of the season park the bus approach failing to impress this season ? All our players cant lose form at the same time.....one major problem is that we have been figured out by other teams and some of the players clearly arent buying into Joses defensive tactics you cant teach creativity it happens naturally and our players are more suited to a creative play rather than the more defensive counter attacking play that Jose constantly demands from them. I feel this might be Joses downfall since he is trying to make them become defenders rather than taking advantage of their attacking creativity and leaving the defending to the defenders. The truth of the matter is if the really enjoyed their football they would do anything to protect their  points whether it is outscoring the opposition or tracking back. The only Urgency to score or form of attacking football shown by Chelsea this season has always been after we concede a goal. Our attacking players no longer create shit but our Beloved manager doesnt care aslong as they help the defenders defend. They are clearly tired of defending they need more attacking freedom. Im afraid if we continue this way and Jose gets his way we will lose some of our exciting players and just become a team of  defenders waiting to counter........,chelseafc,cwkdicu,0,t5_2rsl6

5563870,0,t3_3r9g2a,Lots of insight. I think the problem is Mourinho. Not that hes not the guy to bring Chelsea forward but he has to go through a transformation of mentality. A beautiful transformation if hes able to pull it off. The transition to become a manager of stability. Being able to bring in youth to keep a locker room motivated for longer periods of time. Neville had great insight about senior players relationships to them. Its not just protections that motivates but it makes senior players dig deeper to lead by example.The transition is ever so important as well now that Chelsea is an established world class FC. Theres no motivation from having something to prove to the world anymore. We need to find our motivation elsewhere.I agree with Carragher your players cannot get motivated if they see the manager with that kind of post match interview.

MLS doesnt have these allstar teams at the top.  Every MLS team has top players and scrubs starting in the same lineup.  MLS teams are also tend not to have great depth for the same reasons.  Thus continental games are extremely low priority and also not real money makers and play the kids a lot. Thus when comparing leagues you have to look across the whole and to the individual rather than to the top teams for MLS.  A useful analogy is that the top spanish german and french teams are better than their English equivilents but those leagues overall are worse thus the PL is still seen as the better league.

This attitude on our part being people in these comments talking about this club as if its dead and fucked for the next few years and further.You almost never go from champions to irreversible shithole in  months it just isnt that sudden in sports unless theres a monetary or political issue. I dont think were a special case in terms of bottoming out I dont think were the outlier group that is actually irreversibly fucked. There is still so much to work with on this club from management to players on down. I know that were still shit this deep into the season and its gone on too long to just be a spell.

Watching him dominate with Chelsea in his original run was my favourite times in football and to see him come back and do it again with us was amazing. Id rather see no one else in press conferences and on the sidelines and rate no one above Jose tactically. That being said something bad happened this season something very very bad. Joses actions whether it was just one situation or it was the result of many alienated his players and they were no longer playing for him. We were all hoping it was just a phase but the phase never ended and this was leading us into huge problems that could have been to deep to get out of. Something had to be done and since you cant fire  players at once the manager will always loose out. Its a sad situation and will be held with much regret for a long time but in this case I dont think the board had a choice.Goodbye sweet prince we will always love you forever in our hearts may you find success anywhere but the premier league you go and we will cherish your memories forever. ,chelseafc,cy38avq,1,t5_2rsl6

That doesnt mean that the new low is the new normal or that were done.We still have an outright advantage over most clubs monetarily and brand wise we have a wealthy owner who wants to win badly and well financially push that were going to be at least in the conversation about some of the best managers in the world for our next appointment. Chelsea FC doesnt go away unless that stuff does too.Theres a chance that the downturn could happen if we hire some piss managers but thats pretty unlikely. Were not talking Rodgers piss levels though if we hire Rodgers hes capable of managing to the unacceptable piss level were talking current season form piss levels. Its more than likely that we hire a decent manager who will not continue the form in the short or long term though their longterm form might be inferior to Mous potential longterm form were he to have not got the sack.Theres too much talent and money in too many places in this organization for us to really fall down to current Spurs form longterm IMO.,chelseafc,cy3tivi,5,t5_2rsl6

We also arent getting top . So if were gonna be midtable might as well try and see if some youth players can break into the rotation this halfseason make some signings and sell some players in the summer and see where we go from there.I just think theres more of a benefit from Kenedy LoftusCheek shit Musonda Colkett or Aina even seeing minutes on the senior side in the Premier League this year than there is if we buy a player we could wait until the summer to buy when either way we end up in the midtable.,chelseafc,cyj1y5e,1,t5_2rsl6

Hopefuly we will see more of him in PL as seems like were playing in  now.Anyway  games unbeaten after Mourinho sack.  Costa goals in his  Hiddink games  remember how Drogba was very bad in  and Hiddink rediscovered his form too?Hopefully we will play more focused and strong in the midweek match against WBA which is much better than sCUNThorpe,chelseafc,cysybfe,2,t5_2rsl6

It was blatantly obvious that mourinho wanted fabregas to regain form and he wanted him to know he had his confidence. That being said its not RLC is isco or james not getting enough starts its a  year old player being asked to produce in a terribly unstable period of the club. It is literally a joke how you guys have convinced yourself that this small sample of mourinhos last months a the club means he was never going to play youth. Let me guess you want bamford and solanke playing up top next season with pasalic ask any monaco fan how bad he is playing in the midfield.

If we manage to hold on to the players next season despite not being in Europe I feel like we can develop a new solid spine. Again. Transitions are always hard and troublesome.

Of course theyd help massively offpitch but we do need to move on from them some day.We will be back as will all of our own guard in a new role. Perhaps Roman is thinking way forward for the club.

6525345,0,t1_czu7arn,I do agree with you that the workrate thing gets misused by those in the antiOscar camp as its certainly not the only thing he brings to the table as you say his offtheball work in terms of movement and runs and Id also add knitting a lot of our play together from front to back.I dont agree that at all that Oscar looks as good as KDB Ozil Silva etc for Brazil he may have flashes for them but consistency is always an issue for him however I guess my main point was not against him specifically but our central midfield balance in general which requires a complete rebuilding in my opinion. For example whats the point in Oscar being able to create more space for Cesc with his offtheball work if we cant play both of them in the same side against opposition of any remote quality which is the case because no manger will play Cesc deep and Oscar at  and rightly so because Cesc is a liability tactically and defensively in that key area. Thats what I mean if we want to be a to be a top side we need to be asking for more of the players we have in those areas. We need to be asking for a player who is good on the ball from deep but is also tactically and defensively aware and we need to be asking for a player who can contribute creatively both on the ball and off it. I admit these kind of signings are difficult but that was my point in the original post.,chelseafc,czu9tt2,2,t5_2rsl6

6553569,1,t3_45dlk2,Oscar isnt a leader and never will be. A leader is bastion of consistency on the pitch. Oscar is not consistent. The contrast between his play under Jose and now under Guus indicates more than a lack of consistency in his play. He pretty much chose to play so bad Chelsea were often looking like they had ten men. Same goes for Hazard Costa and Cesc. So thats our top goalscorer our star player our best passer and top of the assists chart as well as the player that is the link between the three. Sure we need those players now to go out of this position we have this squad till the end of season and its a thin squad.

6669117,0,t3_46zk4i,Thanks for posting this. Good article and I think its particularly good to bring the  myth to the attention of the sub. Its been a bit frustrating to see a lot people write him off based on the fact he played mostly a  since his time with Juventus as if a world class manager wouldnt adapt properly to the characteristics and strengths of his squad. In fact thats exactly what hes already shown hes capable of doing  he never played with a back  until he came to Juventus and realised he had much more quality through the middle all over the pitch than in wider areas so he adapted and played to the squads strengths to great success. Would love him at Chelsea.,chelseafc,d09572w,17,t5_2rsl6

6709773,0,t3_47iyo8,Leaders are absolutely vital for a winning team. Just look at Arsenal. The only reason they dont win trophies with all that talent is lack of leaders who are capable of stepping it up on the big occasions and pulling through for the team. In the past we had teams consisting of Cech Terry Lamps Drogba Essien Ballack Shevchenko and Brana most of whom were captaining their national teams. Hell I even remember Ashley and Joe Cole captaining our team. That team was capable of going into autopilot mode and keep performing and win trophies consistently even when managers kept changing.Right now we have Terry Brana Cesc and Costa. Of course its impossible to have a team full of leaders because its not  when we can just buy all the established players. So a couple of big signings and the likes of Azpi and Willian becoming even better next season and I think we should be set. I dont think theres a need of a major overhaul we have a pretty stable team. Most important thing of all is having managerial stability for at least  years.,chelseafc,d0dcjg1,11,t5_2rsl6

6720887,0,t3_47iyo8,For  years Chelsea relied on a team full of character and leaders. Managers gone? No problem the players will step up and be counted. It was a beautiful time and the character of the players suited the high intensity physical game that Chelsea played. However I have doubts about Chelseas ability to put together a squad like that again. Heres why It is simply impossible to have so many quality leaders lots of them NT captains in one team again. The era in which that team was built had very different dynamics in the transfer windows. Chelsea were one of the few clubs that had the cash to splash. Now clubs like City and PSG have come up while old giants like Utd and Liverpool even Arsenal to a certain extent have realised that they can spend money too. I cant imagine a great like Ballack wanting to move to Chelsea if he was playing today however I can very easily imagine him moving to Juve or PSG. This might seem a bit anecdotal but I think there are fewer of these players to go around these days anyway. Football used to be filled with characters with a lot of passion and determination an iron will if you will. However that kind of player has increasingly come to be replaced by the dispassionate professional who will train play matches and collect his cheque at the end of the week without feeling a responsibility towards the club. The clubs transfer dealings also point to the fact that the club is not particularly keen to retainacquire this sort of player. We let go of David Luiz and Juan Mata two young players from that spirited CL triumph that were channeling the character of the old guard. We never attempted to buy similar players and have very few NT captains left on our roster. However Contes appointment makes me feel a little optimistic to acquire players with an iron will again. Heck he seems like the kind of guy who would forge an iron will into the minds of a lot of our players. What he did with Pirlo Pogba Vidal Marchisio Tevez Bonucci and Barzagli was a sight to behold. Even if we acquire  players of that ilk and determination I think the good days could come back. ,chelseafc,d0ehxgb,1,t5_2rsl6

6966616,0,t1_d15zvzd,Southampton wasnt a penalty. United at home shouldve been our win if we got that penalty for the blind handball and Costa bottled his chance at the end. United away Rooney and Herrera shouldve been sent off . Pedro and Hazard also had a chance at the start of that game that they fucked up. United at home they were all over us for  minutes and in that first half we had the clear cut chances including the penalty i mentioned. We dominated them as soon as we went  down the lingaard chance was the only one they had other than the one near the end that Memphis ruined. Everton at home the rd goal wasnt a corner and deolofeus cross went out before it came in. Southampton away it was never a penalty cahill fell on the floor and it hit his elbow. Norwich away they were fortunate Costa didnt put away his on at the start of the nd half or a number of chances we didnt put away when it was so open traroe missed a v created by hazard in the first half as well just of the top of my head. hell even west brom i cant take anyone seriously that starts a sentence with hell even let alone someone who thinks a game where yacob shouldve been sent off  times is something that couldve gone either way. We wouldve won if he got sent off for his foul on Costa off the ball. For every game i mentioned i can bring up refereeing decisions and chances we bottled. If you want to bring up Norwich and say they couldve won if they didnt ruin chances then ill bring up all the games that weve conceded in because of our dreadful defence most if not all goals we concede are not us getting outplayed. its the shit back  gifting goals to the other team. Hiddink cannot do anything if cahill backs off if  players get shrugged aside by Lukaku first goal for everton in the  he cant do jack shit about the defending on Carolls goal today.

6967056,0,t1_d15qbdb,Thats not accurate. Bringing in a striker to compete w Costa is different than bringing in a striker as ndrd choice. At the start of the season I was content with the three we had given everyones predictions things would go much more smoothly.Patos negative impact is that he was brought in to replace two unfit players and he himself was unfit. We mortgaged our season to survive in the cup competitions but then didnt have a fit senior striker to play both knockout matches. Thats absurd. With his failure to play today Pato will not make his Chelsea debut until April more than  months after he signed and with all chances for silverware gone. Thats a terrible failure.,chelseafc,d161vck,1,t5_2rsl6
6968773,1,t1_d1637t8,i think you are underestimating just how good that back  for Atletico is.  Not taking away from Courtois and his performance but they are the best in the world ,chelseafc,d168w59,-2,t5_2rsl6
6969973,0,t3_4b62ho,On his day he can run a match . He gets his fair share of goals and assists and he despite what you say DID provide mourinho with the qualities that Mata didnt posses and it was evident in the first half of last season before he faded. He was essential to the press nobody exchanged better with hazard than he did he won the ball back very frequently he improved the fluidity of our attack very well as his movement is formidable on the attack and he provides a crucial link between our defence and attack on top of his heavy share of defensive work. Ideally he was perfect for mourinho. All ive just said is in the past. Im trying to speak in relative terms to how our board was thinking with his progress. After he started fading last year yes you could assume and im sure the club assumed that he was a tired and overworked young individual. He had no summer break for the previous  years and had a gruelling world cup and on top of that Mourinho is known to keep a small squad and work his favourites very hard. So at this point you would think perhaps he is still young and we would be fools to let a talent go at this point of the season just because of his exhaustion. Now onto this season well the entire team was horrendous for the first half of the season and ofcourse he was one of them but still it makes sense to evaluate him when the entire team isnt dire and thats happening now. He is simply not good enough to be a chelsea player and his consistency is just simply unforgivable. And one big thing of note is his shooting. He used to have a fantastic shot on him last season and before but this season its simply been atrocious and its hard to understand how that strength that he used to have has regressed so much and certainly it is difficult to predict that something like this wouldve happened. Now it is evident and it would seem likely that he is sold in the summer. Hindsight is  at the time it would seem like selling him would be a big mistake and he could like KDB blossom in another team and we would be whining about letting him go as well but like all risks it wasnt always going to go well. We never really know and thats football some risks keepingselling pay off and others dont. from those transfer windows that we kept him it would still seem too unfair to have sold him. Lets be fair to him he did show signs of turning into a wonderful player for us there was a reason so many chelsea fans including myself were so hopeful for him to finally have his breakout season even mourinho predicted it at the start of the season this year and like i said it simply hasnt happened and hes not what we hoped for him to be. He needs to be sold but you need to understand that its not complete lunacy that we didnt sell him earlier because you have to consider the circumstances at the time and what the options were. If however he isnt sold this summer then i think you can talk about all this football sense of the club for keeping him or question the clubs desire to be elite in regards to oscar,chelseafc,d16dssy,33,t5_2rsl6

He has for example never been very good at crossing. However his offensive plays does weaken his defensive side.  Looking at it this way it makes sense for him to be better on the left. Playing against his foot means he simply cant play offensive plus he has to cover for Hazard whicj strengthens and solidifies his defensive game. ,chelseafc,d32m5px,3,t5_2rsl6

Hes good world class good but we both agree Lampard is better in the positions where they made a name for themselves.I see no point in arguing Gerrard was the more complete  versatile player because thatd just make him a glorified Phil Neville. Both Gerrard and Essien have better stamina and speed than Lamps which allows them to be played in a variety of positions but thats mainly down to the physical side of things. I see no point in not building a team around either Lampard or Gerrard and itd be fair to say you wouldnt want your best player playing somewhere he isnt playing his best. So what if Gerrard can play centre back or out wide thats just a waste of his talent.

I dont know what is the definition of world class by your standard but for me Dave as an LB IS good enough for Chelsea. If the choice is only between those two then its fairly obvious. But if I had the choice in shortterm Id rather just buy an upgraded RB at this point. Sorry English is not my first Language I dont know why its idiotic to call Sunderland black Cat. and your following argument  doesnt make any sense to me at all its like saying players like Ryan Taylor  from NewCastle and Alan Hutton from Villa were just good enough to play for us because they fighting for relegation every year and I think as a fullback you should be definitely included in shit defence as whole.p.s.

He owns the club so he obviously doesnt need to pay for tickets right?However he chose to pay the  million to add to Chelseas revenue and the  million was fairvalue for the ticketshospitality. This is called a related party transaction and is permitted as long as there is fair value.So if Abramovich tried to pay  million for those tickets then of course that wouldnt be fair value and even though the  million was injected into the club UEFA would adjust that  million back down to  million when doing its FFP compliance calculations.Manchester City is a commercial juggernaut and while they do have a lot of sponsorship from the Middle East the club has never been charged with artificially boosting revenue through financial doping rather they just overspent.,chelseafc,d71pbye,13,t5_2rsl6

8967676,0,t3_5341u0,I said it before after the Swansea game you cannot afford to drop back and give the other team the chance to get in the game and today we paid for it.I think Conte got everything wrong starting with the lack of any pressing at all. I understand you dont want to get beat by Liverpools technical players but that was ridiculous. We could not win the ball at all.The  across in midfield does not work. It leaves Costa isolated also shown against Swansea where he had to hold up the ball for ages on his own. There is no  and it meant Hazard was having to drift in to get the ball. He was getting overcrowded but it did leave Azpi open but he kept cutting inside. Just goes to show how poor our recruitment was that we couldnt get a full back worthy of starting.Second half Oscar moved up front and stuck to Liverpools centre backs. It didnt work as again there was no one to pass to it just left us switching the ball endlessly. Costa had to keep coming short when it should have been Oscar. Were also relying on Matic to be an attacking force whilst he did set up the goal hes too clumsy.We scored after  mins had no chances up until the subs came on at  mins. Thats  mins of nothing happening on the pitch and no changes being made to fix it. I felt as though this has happened in all of our games leaving it too late but it worked then. Conte should have made the changes earlier.The first goal ultimately shows how important it is to have a leader like Terry at the back.

Otherwise he would have got his lackey Hiddink to follow through or appoint a new manager willing to do so.  No signs of either gt Unknown. I dont think anyone can speak against the board without knowing what they have been asked to do. This could be ineptitude from members or it could be the overall plan of the leadership.According to this logic either the owner is failing supporting point  the board is failing to implement the owners plans or worse the whole setup is crooked. gt Debatable on all points Pep is massively overrated but hes been given a blank cheque to build a team. Liverpool and Spurs do not have better managers. That is nonsense. Mourinho at United hurts but we know his pattern do well first year. Win second year everything falls apart and he leaves third year.Some parts are debatable but not all. Pep might be overrated but his record stands for itself at big clubs with money to spend just the situation hes in now.

9133243,0,t1_d89ohfb,Doesnt really matter what you call it. Kante and Matic played in front of the back three Willian and Hazard supported Costa from narrower positions to leave space for the wingbacks to overlap. Moses definitely got forward more and popped up in a lot of central areas and there was a lot of fluidity between  him Willian and Hazard. When we had possession and Moses pushed forward Alonso kept his positioning pretty wide and far up the pitch while Cahill and Dave got a wider.

Regardless even if it is in summer theres no reason for them to sell him unless he REALLY wants to play outside France and pushes for the move which it doesnt look like he has it just sounds like his agent angling for more money.Saying that however I think Verratti is already one of the best CMs in the world right now and still only  years old.

9968680,0,t1_db6uety,I think Abraham would suffer similarly to Solanke in lack of game time. And more similar to RLC if he did get game time. Theres a reason Chalobah is closest to the first team. And its because hes played at the highest level on loan and competitively against adults for years.Baker Im not sure how hed really fit in the squad he isnt really someone we can use.Christensen I agree. And Boga Im not sure hes ready to challenge anyone currently in the first team squad but I do think hes nearly at a good senior level.All this being said if it means we actually have players we can use in the squad then thats great. But I dont see Abraham being a players wed use yet. And Baker and Boga might suffer due to not really having a role in the squad either because were stacked in AMWide positions or because we have Cesc and dont really need another player in that role. I do think Baker is more physical though so perhaps thats fair. Baker as essentially a replacement in the squad for the outgoing Oscar. And Mikel is off on a free too tbfTechnically we could declare Solanke Aina et al in the CL squad. It wouldnt mean we actually use them any more than we have done so far? There are a hell of a lot of hypotheticals here. But I still doubt Conte will be comfortable introducing that much youth at once for games that theoretically could use the rotation. I wouldnt really argue we have great squad depth and maybe that is on purpose to facilitate the youngsters but they still never get used. The point isnt that we dont have any club grown players at the club. Its just that we have no club grown players capable or willing to be in the squad. And they arent given chances in a structured way. I dont know if there should be a mandate at a board level to only play cup competitions with a certain average age or something. Of course if we stopped buying tons of players ahead of them in recent years then maybe wed be fine.I can see your point but I dont think filling the places equates to using the places.

9974565,0,t3_5idh4w,I was in the camp of the board screwed us over with inaction and naivete in the summer transfer window . Much better in  summer which saw ambitious signings like Kante and of course Conte himself. So really I think its less about whos vindicated and more that the board did its job this time.Im one of those who defended Mou and heck Ill still defend Mourinho vs journo bullshit on rsoccer even now. But it was clear in  he was on a self destruct path. I think most of us who kept faith and disappointed with the sacking were hoping hed snap out of it. In the end he didnt and probably couldnt since the damage were already done from the Eva stuff and troubles that extend to the  season nd half.

9975806,0,t3_5ic730,We were stupid good under Mourinho in those two first seasons. When he arrived nobody knew what to expect from him. Everyone saw him as an egomaniac with a god syndrome. And then he started managing...We were playing such effective football like never before and never after rock solid defense lethal counterattacks  and almost fundamentalist belief in the manager and his philosophy were the keys. We were already winning  before a match started. Teams feared us not only in England but in the whole Europe. Mourinho was so close to achieve the invincible status too. We finished the league run with only one loss and  points! Can you imagine?Gosh we should have won Champions League that first season too...I remember the second season under Mourinho we practically won the league by January with  wins in  matches. The gap between us and the second team Man Utd was like  points or something. Sure they managed to cut the distance with their impressive run of  wins in a row but we were just too far away by that time.,chelseafc,db7vic3,2,t5_2rsl6

Even if we are top of the league. He didnt have any of his first choice Morata Koulibalynainggolan. Now that he has the oscar money that he can assure a UCL place the next windows he want to move forward and build a team more like him  In the eleven  only few changes most of them are  mourinho players . He always said that we can improve thats what he want to do with the squad  Azpi is not at his position Cahill is  no real back up except Zouma who didnt play except the  game Terry is superb but old etc,chelseafc,dbk7k41,4,t5_2rsl6

Our team through a combination of small injuries and suspensions has seen the likes of Kante Hazard Costa Pedro and Matic all miss a game recently and it should mean theyve got a little bit more left in the tank.Essentially the longer the game goes on the stronger I think well become Im hoping for a win of course but I feel optimistic regardless of the result this for me is the nd hardest fixture left in our season and we go into it with the total luxury of that even the worst scenario leaves us  points clear.,chelseafc,dbxuw2c,6,t5_2rsl6

Chelseas transfer strategy should be to keep everyone whos getting playing time until summer to finish out the season preferably winning the league in the process of course and then have a clean out in summer. Were bringing players like Christensen back anyway thats a good time to take stock of what we have and build something new. Defending a league title is notoriously difficult its often said that you should aim to bring in a decent number of new players to fight for places and prevent complacency. But until then changing the squad could really harm the title run Willian may not be starting but at the minute hes the immediate back up to Hazard Costa and Pedro.

10566920,0,t3_5rb9v6,I agree Hazard had a bad game he did win the FK that led to the goal but he wasnt in his usual form.

10573300,0,t3_5rcsd3,He had a strange game. Both he and Costa struggled to get into the game early on because although kante was everywhere defensively forward passes from midfield were pretty poor. He started to come into it in the second half almost turned their CB when he was last man made some good runs then he gets subbed. A frustrating night and we should have won.... Wheres the fucking bus!?,chelseafc,dd6jxaf,3,t5_2rsl6
10577775,0,t1_dd6y5he,Yes but Chalobah was already playing he wasnt replacing Mikel this transfer window because he had already displaced Mikel. Mikel didnt need replacing though thats not my issue. My issue is that we have been using Brana this season he has been playing and he has been doing an important job that no one off of our bench can do anymore. It has genuinely made our team weaker losing him and we have no form of backup. Unless of course he has decided Zouma can come off the bench at the end of the game to win the backpost headers in the same way that Ivanovic was. There have been a couple of games this season where i personally feel that Ivanovic coming on late in the game saved us points. We need that dominating force on the right hand side whilst defending late on whether that be from RCB or RWB. Unless azpi is shifted out to RWB and Zouma is moved into RCB we no longer have that. But of course you wouldnt want to make that change mid game as it would disrupt our defence. I think losing Ivanovic without any form of replacement was a mistake and will cost us points but i totally understand it from a club thankyou point of view.,chelseafc,dd70jx5,1,t5_2rsl6

There are people that find him to be a good player that can be a great force but is incapable of using his capacity pace dribbling finding space scoring.

He could have a terrible game vs Liverpool for example and still get praised. Yet I wonder why he didnt start today. To me Conte must have seen him as not being as good as Pedro.

In a split second his choice was almost a goal. nd chance was poor execution but bright idea.rd and th however are selfish and obvious poor decisions.

I would love us to put in a performance like we did against Southampton. Just a flawless and powerful display with complete control of the game at a very difficult ground. I still think that was our best performance of the season after the Everton one. HazardCostaPedro up front with Matic and Kante in midfield because I want us to dictate the pace of the game and establish control in the middle and then Fabregas coming on earlier than he usually does to dig deeper into Burnleys defence.  for me Hazard assisted by Matic and Costa assisted by Fabregas,chelseafc,ddmo8l0,37,t5_2rsl6

10965481,0,t1_deapr24,. Being top of the table means you are performing better than everyone else and getting the results. If you believe Chelsea recently has been poor I dont think you really understand that Conte addressed a situation immediately when there was an issue. Losing games? change tactics work on fitness and suddenly a  game win streak equalling a record. Ofcourse theres going to be poor performances over  games especially in one of the highest tempo leagues in Europe and definitely the most physical. Youre talking about us potentially slipping due to negligence when we have a  point lead aka a bigger lead than ANY club in Europes top  leagues?. Who are you to claim who the right or wrong targets are? You a scout or the manager who knows exactly what is best for Chelsea atm? You can give suggestions but nothing is outright WRONG. This is a title winning team currently one the best team in the league which obviously means the players as a collective unit have the quality to do so. Ofcourse we could go for better targets but you dont go for targets based off of name. Man Utd got Zlatan and Pogba and are currently looking at Greizmann and Neymar. Oh where are they again?? th. Arsenal used to be th  years ago since then they added Sanchez Ozil and Cech where are they now? oh wait still th!!!!. No not every single player is the best in their positions. Barcelona dont have all the best in their position Bayern dont have all the best in their position PSG dont have all the best in their position. But as a collective unit ours is the best in the league. That does not mean improvements are not needed ofcourse they are if we are going to mount another title challenge you consistently need improvements because every team around you is improving. For example I would argue that Zouma is better than Cahill that doesnt mean Zouma goes best with the current back  though? as a collective unit they may get worse rather than better because of a different player regardless of better or worse.. It should somewhat unless youve just been a casual spectator for decades. How can you be dissatisfied with recent years when we are potentially going to become premier league winners twice in three years? The negligence of the board who literally allowed Conte to go on a spending spree? And do anything possible to get us back to the top? thats negligence for you? And loyalty towards mediocre players even though courtois azpilicueta david luiz kante matic situational hazard diego costa begovic moses willian are one of the best in their positions some in the league some in the world? By begovic i mean as one of the best back up goalkeepers. And you dont believe me on moses i dont think barcelona were targeting mediocrity in his position he is CURRENTLY one of the best. We went for targets we could only achieve as a th placed team last season and even with those restrictions we are top of the league. So if chelsea somehow manage to disappoint you because theyre not winning the league every year and the champions league every other year then obviously no team in england would satisfy you maybe you should check out barcelonabayernreal madrid from now on bud.

This is no Terry situation  Chelsea are bringing through multiple talents at once. That foursome may also just be the start.Except that foursome doesnt really play. Chalobah has started four Cup games all year and hasnt played in the league in . At no point has he looked like challenging anyone for a real position in the first eleven.  The less said about RLC the better but he has started in two Cup games all season and has played five minutes in the league since October. These are not starters for games that the club are going to deem a priority. Theyre just not. You could argue that they need even more opportunities and that first team training and spot appearances off the bench and in cup games are not enough. I disagree. Theres a point where you have to trust the professionals that see every touch of the ball these players make and if theyre not seeing enough to trust them to perform then theres a reason and thats why theyre not playing them. There are a number of players out on loan that arent going to make it but Baker Abraham Bogo Brown Christensen and even Baba deserve an opportunity to be reevaluated along with Musonda Ake Aina next summer to see if theyre ready for a chance. ,chelseafc,defmqkh,8,t5_2rsl6

11132040,0,t3_5yy77u,gtAntonio Conte will play hardball over his Chelsea future by insisting the club uses the summer transfer window to build him a squad capable of winning the Champions League as a condition of committing to a longterm contract.gtThe Italian will ask for investment in all areas of the team and wants Champions League quality starters at centreforward in the centre of midfield and in the middle and righthand side of his defence. With Diego Costa and Thibaut Courtois angling for returns to Spanish football the total cost could exceed m in transfer fees.gtAccording to sources Conte believes he is entitled to such support for establishing Chelsea as Premier League championselect in his first season at Stamford Bridge. This is particularly so as the club failed to provide him with any of the reinforcements he requested ahead of the current campaign.gtHe will also argue that a managerled recruitment policy is essential to transferring the clubs domestic success to the Champions Leagues significantly more demanding stage.gtChelsea secured Conte on a threeyear contract before he took Italy to last summers European Championship. Though the club has yet to formally offer the yearold an improved deal journalists have been briefed that an extension will be announced at the end of this campaign.gtWhile Conte expects his salary to be improved as one condition of agreeing a new contract he has told friends that the construction of a squad capable of winning a first Champions League as a coach is more important.

11134178,0,t1_dettiya,No not even close. The rivalry came as much from the two teams as it did from the fans back then. We simply dont have games like that any more and probably never will.,chelseafc,deu1r9d,1,t5_2rsl6
11134460,0,t3_5yy77u,Imagine getting a world class striker to play slightly behind costa next season. and it is I think incredibly realistic we get him for another year. For both a run in the champions league with a contending team and also because he likely wants to return to atletico and they have the transfer ban for the next window. But thinking of the success that conte got from Eder who is pretty average imagine having the center of our attack spearheaded. The direct soccer we play with diegos hold up play would be fabulous. Im not even the back biggest lukaku fan but he would do really well in a roll like this that involves smart movement into space. For the matter if psg could be puruaded cavani would be perfect for this. Also think Suarezsturrige one world class striker who is also a playmaker elevating an ok striker. Anyway if we buy a real big guy when costa  leaves were set. And bats could foreseeably take the second striker role. Now as eden has tended to play the False nine role where does that leave our midfield? I am still very interested in the idea of fabregas being turns into contes Chelsea version of pirlo. I just think that in the champions league especially when its very hard for English teams to go to places like Russia where homefield advantage can give teams on paper we should be much higher chances of winning we need him to direct the game and basically be a chance creator who would then get to great targets to it from anywhere on the field with Percision. I just think that if Conte can make Fabregas work for our starting  we really will have a Champions Lee contending side.So then what is the make up of the rest of the midfield. Obviously you have Kante hes youre th and th man. Who then to anchor the other side. It vexes me. But have we ever seen hazard attempt a box to box role in the middle of the park? Could a midfield three of Hazard Kante and Fabregas work. It seems pretty crazy so I dont know. These are just players would have to be in the team and I dont think they work at wing back.As far as center backs go. I really dont think we need to invest the money there I think thats been said many many times year. We have returning loan player Christiansen who is already had Champions league performance experience. Everyone has played with regards him very highly and keeping Juventus to A scoreless draw is a game our boss will have seen so I think he will give him a good look. Luiz has been made so much better by this season I think he is essentially beyond reproach and will get another good two or three seasons out of the guy. Cahill has also been excellent but I think he lacks a bit of dynamic play in terms of game awareness going forward which can be tough on so wing backs. Dave is dave but dont Forget he came in and replaced one of the best left backs in English history from an injury and never lost the spot because he was that good. any of our youth players can do what Azpi has done in order to establish themselves. I personally feel that Ak is the player in the squad who is most ready to play a role in our defense but acknowledge that may change when happy gets more comfortable coming back from injury. The one thing I will say about Nathan is that his positioning and his ability to go forward which was more on display and effective at Watford as opposed to his return to the first team granted makes me a favor him. But what Zouma has to make up for getting Lost positionally is his incredible ability to time tackles and his tenacious physicality. Defender in the air like that is always a huge advantage in the box again set pieces and corners. Either of these guys working with Conte for the remainder of the season and preseason next time around it really establish themselves.As for wingbacks I think this is where the most money should and will be spent. I have love for Moses probably more than most simple because I have enjoyed watching him from that first preseason game is he stepped out a  blue. but although his driving to the end line forage ace skill most of the time to take players on successful he has made him an incredible asset for us this season. his inability to cross effectively notably hitting the first man not once or twice a game but quite often if not all but once or twice is becoming frustrating when he gets himself into such a good position with such good runs in the box it becomes frustratingly wasteful and I cant imagine Conte is  behind him in that regard. I can see him sliding into a super sub roll.Alonso is difficult to Peg down. Some of the time he can dribble like another hazard and others he looks a bit clueless on the ball. His high ball winning and overall athleticism are great qualities. But I have always regarded him as a stopgap for contes first season and first transfer window. I really would not be surprised to see him replaced even though I really cant complain that he came here to do a job and even though his position was changed he put the work in.At this point though it becomes to be on earth the players we have and what theyve done in potentially winning us a league title after the year we had last season or do we do whatever it takes to lift the champions league trophy with formal much that even if we break many eggs we might not have a trophy to lift and instead my just have a messy kitchen floor. I trust Conte. That is what I know. And Chelsea even regardless of our league form have always felt strong in Europe. Notably somebody posted that we are the only English team with the positive goal coefficient against Barcelona. Its little things like this that always make me believe that on any given year something special can happen we can win it. You need luck to win the champions league. But the look comes on the back of a huge amount of preparation unified team spirit and direction collection of worldclass players and a very deep bench and generally the mentality of a championship side. The mentality we have been seeing in our players for most of the season. Conte has been building us for Europe and if the board is asked by him for things that he needs for us to lift the a CL trophy again I think they will be behind him. I think this because Abramovich is the type of guy who hundred percent believes that his club he spends his money on should be the one who wins the highest honor. And most of the time I do believe he is a genuine fan of the game and having made Chelsea his club he wishes to see all of our players with their hands on the silverware.,chelseafc,deu2wk4,10,t5_2rsl6

Kant doesnt have an eye for the pass conte said himself that kant have to improve that.gt Kante is extraordinary. He brings a lot of quantity ok but what quality too. Even if he should improve in his buildup play. His first pass is always horizontal and he needs to make that vertical. I was just like him so I do understand.If we play in a  CM system with BakayokoKante its the same. Bakayoko is better in the build up play than Kant. Bakayoko have the strenght to hold the ball not only tacking it back. Hes very important for the monaco team because the LBRB push a lot.

11400976,0,t1_dfo8egx,The sales were Mourinhos choice. I dont think the board would want us to sell our x POTY in Mata in his prime years. Mourinho just generally doesnt trust youth and it was rightfully so at the time he was still  and to take on the burden of scoring your way to the PL is a difficult task. I think hes more ready than then  ready? probably not but I think worthwhile in the long run.And if youre going to mention inconsistency Costa has been consistently great in first half of the season then consistently poor the second half. He put in a few good performances yes but ultimately it wasnt a great winter for him.Yeah but is there anyone better than Costa in the transfer market atm for an affordable price? nope. So imo any one of Morata or Lukaku are our best options next season. I dont think anyone on this thread should complain if we get either one of them because there is literally no one better that is somewhat affordable or isnt old. Closest candidates imo would be Griezmann Dybala Icardi Bellotti. Morata and Lukaku top it in terms of suiting our style of play most though even though I would be excited to see what IcardiGriezmann could do here but again pricey and reluctance to leave.As for Sanchez Hazard flaked out too. Would you have wanted him to leave though? knowing his quality? Lets face it Sanchez is the only reason Arsenal are even th atm. Hes been saving their ass so many times this season. Why? because he cares about winning.Plus I dont think Conte would allow something like last season to happen. He would probably beat every one of them. Also if we go through a similar thing next season we would know that the players are  the problem and Id be happy to sell each and every one of them if need be.,chelseafc,dfoabki,1,t5_2rsl6

Honestly from what I saw from the highlights Costa did work to get the goal. He had shots which happened to get blocked or saved his frustration was obvious to see at times during the game. I think the criticism is unfair tbh the whole team hasnt been playing as well as they were at the end of last yearbeginning of this year so its going to affect his ability to score goals more consistently. ,chelseafc,dfq8lnp,0,t5_2rsl6

11714273,1,t1_dgnqy7k,Youre all downvoting without understanding our football. Our left central midfielder is deeper than the one on the right. Matic plays left Kante plays right. Matic allows Kante to run around and chase the ball by covering him always being in position and using and distributing the ball forwards which Kante doesnt do unless its via dribbling carrying the ball. Matic is crucial there and when Conte doesnt play Kante has to play on the left so Fabregas plays in the more forward central midfield role on the right and Kante cant do the sitting role that Matic does amazingly.I literally said Kante is probably the best ball winner in the world but that doesnt make him good at passing or have the positional sense that Matic has. Players can be good at one thing but not good at others its not that hard to comprehend.Our balance without Matic is ruined as we saw against City. Our best team is with all three of Matic Kante and Fabregas. They complement eachother fantastically and that is a world class midfield.Hazard has been the best player in the league.,chelseafc,dgnubpu,-2,t5_2rsl6

11754391,0,t3_67n0nn,I see people here willing to trade Costa for a maybe little less talented striker thatll be consistent through out next season but i believe with the return of CL football to the bridge we will actually need the brilliance of a striker like Diego. On his day he is in the top  strikers in the world and thats what gets you to a CL final. If hes inconsistent i trust Conte will bench him and hopefully his replacement will be good enough but at least  of the time well have a world class striker made up stat but considering his goal scoring record and consistency in the past  seasons i believe thats not far from the truth ,chelseafc,dgse1n4,1,t5_2rsl6
