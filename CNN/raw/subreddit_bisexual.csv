If I were you I would mention being bi from the start of a relationship which it sounds like you did in that one. People who arent bi I think sometimes have difficulty understanding what it actually means to be bi. Most of them that I have dated who were either straight or gay sometimes seem to feel like they wont have anything to offer a bisexual because they like one gender and you like both.

199040,0,t3_1wdvyp,Some things about this post make me think you need to figure some stuff out before you even consider adding a third into your relationship. First the title you need advice handling your girlfriend? Sounds like shes an object to you. Second gtShe claims to be bisexual and has frequently partaken of activities that lead me to believe this is a genuine interestNo. She need only make the claim for you to accept her identity as true and valid. When you say things like this youre questioning her identity. Thats biphobia my friend. This line is also at odds with the title. Does she identify as bisexual or is she bicurious?Third gtI am similarly conflicted because I see how unhappy she is and how difficult it is for her to repress her own desires but I fear that I encourage her for my own selfish reasons being someone who has both voyeuristic desires and my own occasional problems denying my promiscuous nature.And here it is. This is your real question it seems. Youre never going to be able to help your girlfriend be the best person she can be until you figure your own shit out. This is that shit. Advice is worth what you pay for it and you didnt pay me anything so take it or leaving. Best of luck.,bisexual,cf142r2,8,t5_2qwnx

472267,0,t1_cftwr6o,Labels serve a practical social function not just a descriptive one. For example Im one of those people who you mention as being a source of conflict. I am primarily attracted to masculine queers of any sex or gender. Sure I could pull out my dictionary and call myself an androsexual masculiniphile or boistudbutchamanti all of which would be more literally descriptive of my orientation than bisexual but no one would know what I meant by it unless theyd read some gender studies tome or were really up on their Tumblr lingo. For the better part of a decade my preference has been queer largely because that word is not seen as binarist and doesnt have pansexuals vague whiff of Wiccan treehuggery thats not bad its just not me. However recently Ive come to see the merits of using bisexual to describe myself to people who have never heard of queer. Bisexual is handy and almost universally understood shorthand for not straight but not gaylesbian. Id prefer if multisexual became more of a thing but you work with what youve got. No word for an individual who dates more than one gender has saturated our society like bisexual has. So Ill keep deploying it when its useful even if its not  accurate since typically the pertinent information that Im trying to communicate by labeling my orientation is that I dont exclusively date one sex. Edit Also bisexuality is no more inherently binarist than hetero or homo sexuality. Even if you take the bi to refer to men and women being attracted to two sexesgenders does not preclude the existence of other sexesgenders. That theoretical literally bisexual girl who is not attracted to genderqueer people isnt erasing them with her sexuality any more than a gay guy is erasing women with his. Bisexuality also does not have anything to do with whether one is cissexist or not. Many bi people love trans people or are trans people. The idea that bi people are all cisgender and only like cis masculine men and cis feminine women is a caricature.,bisexual,cfty6o7,10,t5_2qwnx

507054,0,t3_1zwx70,If you dont want an answer you can ignore my post.If you want to move forward accept and embrace this part of yourself. Fluctuations of interest seem fairly normal among bisexuals and even though I do not experience them Ive still had my own struggles with accepting myself.Im not going to claim that I know why your preferences fluctuate. I can offer guesses but thats all I can offer. My first guess might be that if part of you is feeling suppressed or hidden it may be sort of lashing out more intensely when you cant hold it in. I know that my emotions can be that way  I can go a long time without consciously recognizing my anger for example but when I do theres all this stuff thats hidden for years. Something similar may be happening if youre not expressing yourself properly.My advice is to find a balance. Perhaps find a good friend who can be there for you when you need to talk or perhaps simply explore some form on nonmonogamous solution though please if you do try nonmonogamy be both honest and safe with all of your partners.From what youve said here I can say that it seems like theres a big conflict within you. You seem to want what you dont have and dont want what you have. Therapy may be helpful to figure out why you lose interest in partners once theyre there for you and want partners that you dont have.My story may not help you but I lived in constant fear of being an outcast because I felt attraction to men. But I dont find myself drawn to men the way Im drawn to women. I dont want to meet guys for dating or sex but once I get to know a guy I may want emotional or physical intimacy. And that scared me for a long time. Especially since I never lose my drive for women even when Im happily connecting with a guy.It took me a long time to accept that part of who I was and I missed some important opportunities during that time. I would encourage you to try alone or with help to find out why this is happening to you. Its hard to understand ourselves but it is rewarding and you may find out how to make your life work out better if you can find out why it happens and how you might change these mood swings to be less drastic.,bisexual,cfxwl3d,17,t5_2qwnx
519371,0,t1_cfz940w,How about you try writing him a letter? That will give you time to put all that you feel into words and give him time to read it and think about it before responding.I grew up in an extremely religious family too where church and God determined every little detail of life so I do understand. You may want to consider finding a therapist or counselor or support group that specializes in people whove had fundamentalist upbringings and rejected them. It can help so much to be around others who understand.And remember it seems so difficult and scary and hurtful now but its all a journey to try to uncover the truth of you the truth of love and the best way you can live. I am not Christian and Im by no means a Biblequoter but I did always like the verse that said You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free and I still believe that part of it. Living a lie or a partial lie or hiding from ones true self will only bring misery to you and those around you. Try not to be afraid.

519874,0,t3_201ul4,I understand where youre coming from completely. I was also raised in a religious family I also had to avert my eyes from women dont even get me started on the middle school torture of its just girls no one cares if we walk around shirtless hehe! and I repressed and was repulsed by my attraction to women for so long that I convinced myself it didnt couldnt exist. I threw myself headfirst into being boy crazy and hindsight is  I now realize it was to distract myself from the possibility of being gay or bisexual. I was still in this phase when I met my current boyfriend and as I discovered myself and grew more comfortable around him I began to really realize what was going on. Ive kind of come to the conclusion that Im somewhere around  on the womenmen attraction scale and it comes in waves. Some days like you Im dick crazy and the sex is fantastic and spontaneous. Other days I just need to curl up with a soft feminine body and even the thought of a big masculine dude repulses me to no end. Luckily my boyfriend is pretty slender and not inyourface masculine. Some days I want both of them together. Anyways Ill stop bitching and give you some advice from my experience I was totally against the open thing at first as well as was my boyfriend. Something that helped me wrap my head around it was to remember that that visceral it feels SO wrong feeling is just another thing taught to you by mono reproductionfocused culture  just like you were subconsciously convinced women were weaker. Also remember that not mono doesnt necessarily mean poly. My boyfriend and I are very sexually open and Ive hooked up with girl friends plenty but Ive never felt remotely romantic towards anyone but him. When I think about being romantic with anyone but him I freak the fuck out. Being open to make outs with friends is very different from being poly. Nothing wrong with it if it works for you but it doesnt for me... doesnt mean I cant be open and have my fun. In the meantime or if after some openminded soul searching you REALLY decide you could never deal with being open porn is your best friend. Im no social butterfly and I prefer to hook up with women Im already friends with so I dont push things too hard or too fast. In the meantime porn and fantasy seriously help. It keeps your libido up and really after a lot of gay porn I often find myself craving some variety. Keep having sex with your boyfriend. Get those juices flowing. It may be awkward at first but its important for both of you to connect like that and the longer you stay away the harder it will be to reconnect. Trust me on this one weve been through long dry spells just because the thought of being penetrated terrified me... but when I relaxed and eased into it the enjoyment came back. If it was there before it will resurface when you allow yourself to get mentally into it again. Last talk to your man about this. Seriously. It may be unfair to deny him sexual connection with you but its even more unfair to shut him out of this process... plus it sucks going through it alone. Let him know that you need him now and you love him reassure him of how much he means to you etc. If you feel like you cant get your thoughts across clearly while speaking write them down think them through and give them to him. Let him see this thread or something.Best of luck... I know how you feel. It gets better and its never too late to open your mind and embrace ALL of who you are. I thought my natural instincts were damaged beyond all fixing as well but trust me theyre there. They will flourish if you give them space to. ltEdit Jesus H Christ that was a long comment.

Youd be a great match and theres no need to rush into anything either. You guys can start chatting maybe meet up and see how you all get along.

He is to blame and should feel remorse for what he has done. Unfortunately  as you state  that doesnt seem to be the case and perhaps wont ever be. The only thing you can do is control the way you feel. That is all. That has been my mantra these last  years after my divorce.  If I give into my anger  than I keep letting him have control in my life. He is not important enough nor worthy to have him affect you so.

757778,0,t3_22u38n,Man a lot of stuff to address here. The other commenter explained sexual fluidity. It happens especially since this is new for you. Dont worry about it and experiment. Regarding coming out to your friends and family thats up to your specific circumstances. My moms homophobic and I work for my dads business so I havent come out to them. I have a bi sister and tolerant friends so Im out with them. Just tell who you want to tell and who you feel is important to know. But if youre financially dependent on your parents be careful theres plenty of horror stories out there. With gay guys are you just not attracted to feminine guys or do you actively dislike homosexuals? Theres nothing wrong with having preferences but judging people on their sexual orientation is pretty hypocritical. And finally talk to a therapist if youre having emotional breakdowns. Theres nothing wrong with being bi but if thats causing you serious emotional distress then you need help. Best of luck. ,bisexual,cgqezoc,2,t5_2qwnx

1141145,0,t1_chxvpen,I think its the idea that theres something to be said about a guy who is a tough skilled warrior who doesnt give a shit what anyone thinks of him. He likes sex and doesnt want to be limited people tend to like that even if they are straight. But the vast majority of youth arent really homophobic in reality at least in my experience. They wont watch two guys making out and doesnt want others to think they are anything less than completely straight but wont shun their best friend if he comes out. So a strong male lead who say fuck it I like who I like probably speaks to the fact that most people hate caring what others think but cant help but care. I was tore between being sick and crying when he died. It was awful he really was my favorite character. But thats basically signing his death warrant anymore.

You know why bi folk claim victim? Because like other marginalized folks we are victims of an oppressive society. If you were an Asian male and all you read online was how girls dont find Asian men attractive or masculine enough it is absolutely fair to say it may negatively impact how you feel about being an Asian male.

1510470,0,t3_2bfuf5,I had a similar experience in that period of my life . I lusted after girls women but the ones I was most interested in would have nothing to do with me.  On the other hand I was constantly being hit on by men and since I really enjoyed the sex with men I usually ended up in bed with them.  They pushed me to accept that I was gay and I thought they might be right except I couldnt reconcile my desire for women. I wasnt falling in love with any of my partners either so that helped me question whether I was gay.  A move to another city a better job joining a social circle that included a lot of girls improving my social skills and pretty soon I was meeting and bedding some great women and really enjoying relating to women.  In my case I ended up married to a woman who was great in bed and who I loved deeply. I thought then that my homosexual side was just history not a phase but still something that I could ignore because I was so satisfied with my wife.  That didnt work out.  I ultimately had to come out as bi to her and that did work out. We ended up having an open relationship. I am one of those bi men who need both men and women in my life at the same time. One of each at least would be ideal!There are bi people who can make a choice to be with only one or the other and maybe they are lucky and have less stress.  But when my desires for men came back early in my marriage it caused me unbelievable stress and would have ruined our relationship had we not found a way to talk and then open up and share. Ive since met a lot of men who have tried to suppress their feelings. Most of these have been men suppressing their feelings for other men and trying to maintain a relationship with a woman.  And failing! Im pretty sure that if way back I had made a commitment to a man I would be frustrated today.  This is the problem with being bi and not gay.  Maybe we can be monogamous with one or the other but we cannot suppress our feelings for the sex that we are not involved with. Both gays and straights i.e. monosexuals have a hard time understanding this.I suspect that you are going to have to explore how you feel about woman by actually getting more involved with them if you are ever going to understand your desires and feeling about them.  This is not something that you should suppress because if you do you most likely will also limit your own growth as an individual. It is going to hurt to talk to your boyfriend about this but it is something that you will have to do.  You will not be whole for him or anyone else until you have a better understanding of yourself.,bisexual,cj5m30z,2,t5_2qwnx

1700897,0,t3_2dodee,I am not having encounters.... I had one relationship with one person that I know.  Yes I posted an ad got nothing but creepy replies but I honestly posted it more for the therapy of getting it off my chest than an actual need for meeting someone.  Yes has the right someone come along I may have met them but I knew that would be a oneinamillion chance.Let me straighten out something though.  None of this was about sex.  I mean it wasnt my primary need.  I didnt need to hook up and do not need to hook up.I do realize I have an incredible need for closeness to another male.  It is such a strong need that it is overwhelming at times.  Of course it seems that sex and this closeness are intertwined but the sexual end is not the driver.  If I wanted just sex as many people do I could easily get it from many women or men.I know that in the strict sense it is cheating... however I am not with another woman.  I am not shorting my wife or family on any of their needs materially or emotionally.  There is nothing lacking at home... and my children have now all hit adult age.To me it doesnt seem like cheating because I am not taking away from my wife.  I am not with another woman.  I am however dealing with a very deep long and complicated issue in my life that needs to be dealt with for my own mental and physical good as well as the good of others around me.Perhaps most of you on here are more on the out side of things or lean more gay or are more sexual than emotional.... but for me I am a guy who is mostly straight.  I know that if I left my wife I would first want another relationship with a female.  I could never live without the companionship of a woman.  However I have only recently come to accept that I also need some kind of relationship with a man.What I had really hoped to accomplish here with this posting was to discuss with other who are or who have been in a similar situation.  I know I have struggled with the issue for as long as I can recall.... and that is only complicated by my life as a completely straight guy.... with a wife and kids to whom I owe some sort of obligation of normalcy.Maybe I could have talked to others who need some advice too.the fixation was unfortunately on infidelity.  Yet I am sure there are many men out there who are tortured by being torn between their normal life and a suppressed burning need for something with a man that they dont understand.Nonetheless posting on here has helped me tremendously.  Confession if you will.  Reading the posts of others has been helpful too.  Even if I didnt get the exact dialogue I had hoped for it was still helpful.Thank you all for your participation and thanks to the internet gods for the existence of reddit where such a venue for discussion could exist.,bisexual,cjtk6t7,0,t5_2qwnx

The attitude of being confident determined sexually active progressive... its just that professional attitude that I will never understand in women and definitely dont find attractive. Picture the woman who picks up the phone at a business and gets margaritas with her girlfriends Wednesdays... its like all women have taken that as their role model. To me a woman in order to be sexy has to be soft coy definitely not come across as promiscuous thats what a hooker is for maybe mysterious for good measure.

2864831,0,t3_2sx0tt,Okay whoa whoaaaaaaa. Slow down there. Most of this has very little to do with your sexuality  it sounds like youre unhappy with a lot of aspects of your life and the issue of sexuality was the straw that broke the proverbial camels back. But the good news is that most of these problems are solvable with varying degrees of difficulty.The root here far as I can tell is a pretty common depression spiral that goes something like this Im lonely. Why am I lonely? Probably because something is wrong with me. Whats wrong with me? Im probably weakbadetc in some way. Since Im weakbadetc I dont deserve to have friends so Ill stay inside. Im lonely... and so on and so forth. Its a spiral you can watch ten times a day at rconfession rdepression or any number of other subs where folks are talking about their problems because its really really common.Advice ahead ignore if youre not looking for itYou say youve been struggling with this for three years and youre . Im gonna put two and two together here and guess that you moved out of your familys place at about the same time you started struggling with this depression. Combine that with a very restrictive family your small social circle and the fact that youve apparently been bingewatching Netflix and Im going to take a crack that you probably got in the habit of staying off by yourself back when you were home but now that youre out of high school and family stuff youre not finding as many ways to just socialize in passing as you used to.I really think thats the root of the issue here. Lack of focus is a hallmark of depression. So is overeating along with the lack of willpower to exercise. Bluntly most people dont want to be friends with someone seriously depressed because its really hard to see someone youre close to struggling so badly. And so on. So thats the place to start. Find yourself a social group. It can be literally anything. For me when I struggled with the same issues it was a tightknit My Little Pony fan group on a forum I ended up on one night.

I think my answer would still be yes people need to accept bisexuals for what they are and just to be clear I am not implying thats what all bisexuals are mainly for lack of a viable alternative repressing your own sexuality would also have a negative influence on marriage in the long run.Thats not to say we should simply use our sexuality as an excuse for declining all responsibility if it were indeed proven that these types of relationships had a negative effect on marriages and children it would be our duty to take some extra steps to mitigate these effects as much as possible perhaps by not indulging in the joys of open love as frequently as we would like and by always going the extra mile to ensure discretion.,bisexual,co7k2j5,1,t5_2qwnx

Initially being a guy I had absolutely ZERO problem with it.  In my mind our sex life just went from  to  in about  seconds and it did for about  months.  She became really good friends with a really HOT girl and they began playing together.  My significant other and I had an agreement that I would participate anytime the two of them got together...BUT I would only have contact with my SO.  Things went GREAT for a while until my SO started seeing her friend without me knowing...they fell in love with each other and I began to experience a lot of jealousy.  It was breaking my heart!  My SO and I were able to work things out and she and I are still married today.  The other girl has moved away and since become married to another woman.  I say all of that to say this...

Im so sorry Im confusing people about what I meant.gtAs to whether I would date a trans person of course! It might be fair to be only attracted to one kind of body but if someone commits to this idea they must be open to both genders with that body. If someones only attracted to one gender one must be open to dating both bodies that can fill this gender. Perhaps many straight people only want one gender and one body type and some gaybi people too! and this is fine but its also good to question if this comes from a place of transphobia or not in my opinion. Thank you. Not to sound grumpy but the few nos Ive received so far have been not very forthcoming at all as to why they wont date a trans guy. Im very much with you on all this. I think its okay to be up front about your desires for instance Im definitely more of a bottom when it comes to guys and two bottoms arent going to have the most awesome chemistry in the bedroom but I also think its unfair to nix trans people off the dating pool based on anatomy. I have trans guy friends who are gay tops exclusively! Not to mention trans guy doesnt automatically mean has a vagina either. Or that trans girl means has a penis. I do think a couple of the nos I received have been based on these principles.

I would be cautious about how many promises you make to someone that is not there physically to comfort you when you are struggle with those promises. I say this from experience. I dated online and IRL a lot over the years. I dated my husband for a year online before we met. But until we were in the same state I did not feel comfortable making promises I may not be able to keep. Its a journey and it is YOUR journey. You are an incredible woman able to love beyond gender.

What you are attracted to can never be discriminatory unless you use it to tell others what they can and cannot do.As for your first point though there is a distinction between sex and gender. While I have my own views on the ideas of multiplefluid gender we will continue under the assumption that they are all accurate. Your gender identity is different than your sex and therefore is not related to sexual orientation. However there are only two sexes.

3804695,0,t1_cqpy2xz,gt IF you REALLY gave a shit what happened in that medium you woulda been hella pissed when I brought up Daken Wolverines son who is VERY openly bisexual and yet uses his sexuality almost solely to seduce men and women before callously killing them once his needs are met.yeah sure thats shitty too. But this is happening now. This is news. This is topical. So this is what I am talking about. I fail to see how me talking about Iceman decreases the legitimacy of my hope to expose and fight all biphobiaand all bigotryfrom society as a whole. No matter where it lies.And pretty much the only reason I DO know about this article in the first place is because my comicbook geek gay friend sent me this article. Really this argument seems like nothing more than ad hominem fallacy to me. I somehow dont lack standing in your eyes to make the argument so you attack my noncomicbookgeek status instead of attacking my argument. In fact youve totally ignored the vast majority of my arguments up until this point. Especially ever since you said You are trying way too hard to maintain being offended. I get it. You dont care. Why do you need me not to care as well?gt If anyone should mad about this situation its whoever has to find a way to explain how young Iceman is totally gay and old Iceman is totally straight cuz THAT explanation is gonna land a mofo in the hot seat no matter what he does if this one line is REALLY that big of a deal.No. It will be easy. Big Iceman is now going to be gay and closeted and will come to terms with it in some way. Thats whats going to happen. Its not even a question.gt should bring my world crashing around meI dont care how you feel about it. Im just pointing out just another piece of biphobia in our culture that shouldnt be there. If you want to say I dont care thats fine. But to say you shouldnt care either is another thing entirely. And thats what youve been saying constantly in this thread.,bisexual,cqpys2u,1,t5_2qwnx

3980557,0,t3_360xr0,It will be hard at first especially depending on your upbringing. My best advice for you is to engage in same sex intercourse when you are comfortable and not to let anyone pressure you. Its absolutely fantastic by the way different for everyone because everyone has their preferences for me its like a kind of play wrestling power struggle mixed with passion pleasure and lots of physical contact. Youll find a great opportunity to explore one day and when you are ready you might have your own amazing experiences. Keep this in mind though. The person you sleep with might be awful at sex it happens so dont let that turn you away. Gay sex is amazing and just as fun as straight sex. If you are going to be the bottom use a LOT of lube and make sure he goes slow. Make sure he wears a condom no matter how much you trust him and you should for when you sleep with girls too!! you dont want a mistake to haunt you for the rest of your life because he or she told you it was fine. Im not trying to be your parent here fuck that but I know from experience that you will very likely be caught up in the heat of the moment and Ive personally had some close calls myself. If they give a crap about you at all they wont care about the condom or will even insist.Other than that have fun go at your own speed relax and enjoy being who you are and who you want to be.PS ask people on reddit for tips about bottoming or having sex with bottoms.

4044646,0,t3_36uaos,I just wrote you an answer to this and then my phone refused to post it. I am sad. Anyways Ill type it again sorry if it shows up twiceDid your brother come out as gay or bi? Personally I feel like coming out as bi carries different issues and expectations. I am confident that if I came out to my mum as gay she would be absolutely fine with it but I am afraid to tell her Im bi because Im worried she wont understand why I am telling her I am currently in a straight relationship and wont take me seriously. Society has different attitudes towards the two things  acceptance of gay people is often framed in terms of them not having a choice. This is pretty damaging to bi people because they are often seen as having the option to be straight and therefore their identity is less supported. I am sure that you are aware of all of these things at least at some level and it is reasonable to expect that you might get a different response coming out as bi than if you said you were gay. That said it sounds like your parents are awesome accepting people and if its important to you that you come out to them then go ahead.Of course this is only relevant if your brother isnt also into girls. If he is it is still perfectly reasonable that you would be nervous about changing the way someone important to you sees you even if you know that that is going to be a positive change. ,bisexual,crhbj7m,3,t5_2qwnx

Same sex marriage would not win in Brazil Im sure. Id guess it would loose in the majority of Latin America Africa Middle East and Id probably in the USA but I can be wrong.So the fact that a catholic country legalized same sex marriage by popular vote is very important and shows that in some places at least society is changing.

4090576,0,t3_37fi50,So my situation is a lot like yours in some ways different in others.  Im M engaged getting married next month.  Grew up in evangelicalhomophobic Texas spent most of college in a bad LTR with a woman and met my nowfiancee without ever getting to experiment with a man.  Unlike your wife my fiancee is herself bisexual and not at all religiousbut like her she tended to make a lot of veiled threats whenever I talked about my orientation and it made her anxious to the point of panic attacks at times.First of all I should point out that your situation is unusual because frankly most men in your situation would just cheatits easy enough to suck a dick without getting caught these daysand the fact that you havent is admirable.  You should take pride in that.  After  years of therapy what has helped me most is identifying with that and getting a better understanding of what exactly it was that I wantedfantasized about from a man.In retrospect I definitely had chances to hook up or fool around with guys at a few points in my life and I shied away from them on one hand you could say that was because of fear selfloathing and internalized homophobia on the other you could also observe that what I wanted wasnt a quick nostrings hookup but rather I wanted love and acceptance for who I was sexuality included from the group that I felt most judged and rejected by men.  I found that embracing the latter interpretation and rejecting the former made me feel a lot less of the kind of misery youre talking about.Once I understood that about myself my life made a lot more sense.  I have enough gay friends now that I understand how hard it is to find that kind of love and acceptance from a man instead of just a hookupthat you can spend decades dating men exclusively and not find itand that even if she had given me a total hall pass to hook up with guys I would probably never find what I wanted.So on one hand that made it a lot easier to accept with some sadness that I wouldnt ever be with a man.  But on the other hand it made me a lot more insistent that my fiancee accept me for who I was and in particular respect and appreciate my hardship and accept it as a gift and a sacrifice.   Getting to there is what took  years of couples therapy plus solo therapy for her anxiety.  I agree with the other posters couples therapy is a good ideaI think your wife is the one with the greater problem adjusting here. Journaling helped me a lot tooyou need to figure out a way to make her understand that your journal is sacrosanct and that being able to vent and express these feelings is absolutely vital to your wellbeing and that requires privacy.  The same goes for private timehaving recourse to whatever fantasies or porn you like is the very least you deserveyoull need them over the coming decades and having to fear being discovered by the person who is supposed to love and accept you is no way to live.,bisexual,crmjtvi,3,t5_2qwnx
4094095,0,t1_crmw5k1,gtI view pansexual as the ultra politically correct terminology for bisexual.Yes! This. Totally agree. Gender is a social construct and the only thing that matters to me is if the person Im interested has a compatible personality. And getting another new term for every minor distinction is tedious IMHO. Everyone has their own nuances just ask the individual to find out if you want to know.I use and prefer bisexual to pansexual since its more commonly understood and because I like the pride flag more. And I see no reason to use a politically correct term.Since bi just means two I say my sex and others or both sexes I know technically there are intersex folk and all that but I count them in it too even though I have never met one to my knowledge. I count trans folk as whatever they identify. That said identify however makes you comfortable.,bisexual,crmyags,6,t5_2qwnx

Its not meant as a redefinition of who you are. You are who you are and we arent here to change that. Rather it is an attack on all those bisexuals who want to exclude certain people who are not bisexual enough in the same way that bisexuals are often excluded for being not gay enough. It is to say if you fit this definition you are always welcome here but it is not to say we will force our identity upon you.This is effectively a reaction to the exclusion we feel by proactively preventing more exclusion.

Anxiety disorders are not conducive to logical thinking.Another problem I have is that older women intimidate me.

They say biphobic things and Piper never ever stands up for herself. You could argue that she doesnt care or doesnt want to or anything like that but at the end of the day its an active decision by the writers to have those characters saying biphobic things and Piper just...going with it.And to somebody who does have biphobic views even if theyre not being intentionally biphobic thats reinforcing to them the idea that its ok. This character whos obviously not a lesbian is called a lesbian and the show never questions it. So people think its ok to call bi girls lesbians even though so many bi girls I know including myself dislike that.Plus if you consider stuff like the transgender character cant remember her name i havent watched any OITNB in a while   people say transphobic things and she calls them out on it and its made clear its not ok.

From afar groups tend to appear a lot more unified than they do when you sit down with the individuals.  Beyond that in my observation human groups tend to fall into one of two categories  those that organize themselves around something a source that inspires them. And  those that organize themselves around that which they dont like in other people.  Its the difference between a group being defined by something intrinsic to itself versus something extrinsic.    Unfortunately as the source of inspiration evaporates even the intrinsically defined group begins to define itself in terms of what it is not.  Its a desperate attempt to stay together.

4678665,0,t3_3f0ott,I had a sliiightly similar situation happen to me last year. Im also  and for a good few months was really struggling with feelings of being very sexually attracted to women. I never identified as anything other than straight but I guess I always knew I had bisexual tendencies I just never gave them much thought. It wasnt until I developed actual feelings for a female friend of mine at school when I finally thought Damn this is it and knew. I wasnt only attracted to a lot of girls throughout my life but I actually had emotional feelings that could develop further through a relationship. When I came out to my best friendon and off again boyfriend he was supportive but at the time we were not dating. I just talked to him about your post because initially I was  confident your boyfriend is having problems adjusting and you couldnt have prevented it because I know how confusing all those thoughts can be and coming out when you were sure versus confused is common and of course using the girl from your class as an example would be the best way to explain how you know now. But my friend gave me a different perspective. He said if we had been dating last year he would have felt the same way as your SO. He would have been upset I wasnt talking through such a major thing when it was happening. It just would make him sad if I didnt want to come to him with it. Not mad just kind of hurt. However the issue he would really have is me continuing to see a girl I was attracted to. Even just physically.  Im not sure to what level you feel for your female friend but if its beyond the normal level of Oh she is a good looking person then it might be understandable for your boyfriend to be upset. There is a difference between finding someone attracted and being attracted to someone for me at least. I argued with my friend and said I never minded if he had attractive female friends when we were together but he countered and said but would you have if I explicitly told you I was attracted to one of them especially if I used it as evidence to my heterosexuality and spent one on one time with her outside of class? Its a verrrry fine line but it might be the important factor here. Everyone finds other people attractive when theyre in relationships. You cant turn that off. But I think one would really hope their SO would not grow close to someone they are particularly attracted to. You want to trust those people just stay distant concepts to your SO and never become solid parts of their lives and potential threats to your relationship. That might be how your boyfriend feels I dont know. Getting coffee with her does not automatically equal a date but telling him you got coffee with a man from your class youre attracted to? How would that go over? Because I respect your boyfriend if he doesnt preceive you getting coffee with a man or woman you are attracted to  differently. And I feel this is the same way hed react if you were straight and your friend was a boy. That being said I feel like communication can help. Either through more thorough clarification or apologizing. I would say however dont write off his feelings just like you wouldnt want him to if the situation was reversed. You had  months to take time to yourself and figure out how you feel and while your boyfriend probably shouldnt need equal time he did hear about this for the first time in a not so ideal way feeling left out and slightly cheated. I can tell from your post neither of those responses were intentional on your part. I did the exact same thing. I used the girl I had feelings for as my example too. Just keep in mind that this man cares about you and takes your coming out so seriously he does have the ability to be jealous of other woman with you now. I may be completely wrong and if so ignore all if this. You just sound like you care for your SO and want to fix this. Trying to relate and see why he feels some way versus resolving hes just over reacting and insecure wont get you anywhere other than out of the relationship. Best of luck with this honestly. Id hate your moments of coming out to be associated with negative ramifications. ,bisexual,ctkal2a,5,t5_2qwnx

This includes possibly having to sit or lay there and listen to them fuck. The moans the sounds the smells everything. Maybe youre exhausted maybe theyre on some substance youre not on including alcohol a common lets get comfortable method. Make sure you understand that if youre not in the right headspace this may cause pain.Just like polyamory in my observation it can be done successfully but it definitely isnt something you do without planning ahead.That said also dont drown in rules. You should make sure you both have the same expectations and have considered the same possibilities yes but if you try to rewrite the Threesome Bill of Rights you will probably set yourselves up for failure andor performance anxiety to the point of failure.Lastly consider your mutual interestexcitement levels. I had an experience where I was proceeding slowly into a possible new situation and I felt my partner was proceeding even more slowly which was fine with me so I set my expectations very mildly. I did not expect her interest to surge wildly after our first allofus date. The sudden new and unexpected interest felt hurtful to me  which felt real but I knew was not rational  and turned me off slightly.The lesson there is understand that humans are animals we have some instinctual feelings that take over and maybe show a side of ourselves our partners arent ready to see quite yet. If you can handle that you can probably proceed. Protip One thing that helps me is to shift perspectives  if I remember that my partner could have made one or two decisions in the past that would have changed the course of their life I can see them enjoying a totally different person in a carefree and guiltfree way without wishing me any harm simply because theyd have been with someone completely other than me. Also share that idea with them verbally  stepping back from your relationship and realizing that it could have worked out differently and that youve made and continue to make a choice to be with each other takes some of the pressure off to prove yourselves in some kind of relationship contest.,bisexual,cus75k1,1,t5_2qwnx

5232545,0,t1_cvgnu5j,In my opinion biphobia and other forms of discrimination only have a place in TV shows and other forms of media if they address it. If they say something biphobic they need another character being like dude wtf or calling them out or something that makes it clear that its a shitty thing to do. I think OITNB does this with some of the trans issues? But the biphobia goes unchecked which reinforces biphobic ideas and its really not clear if theyre just saying these characters have shitty views or just representing shitty things. And personally I think the fact that oitnb IS quite progressive is more of a reason to hold it accountable for biphobia I havent watched sense yet so no opinion there. Theyve shown that they understand issues theyve shown that theyll represent those issues but they ignore the conversation about biphobia and Ive seen this over and over and over its not like nobody is trying to make them aware of it  . Plus it runs the risk of people taking in those views because this is a show that has good representation right? It must have accurate views. ,bisexual,cvgpnpt,10,t5_2qwnx

One of your preferences is based on gender. For me that preference doesnt necessarily exist. I have other preferences that you might not have and vice versa. For a little perspective I totally dont understand being completely heterosexual or homosexual. It blows my mind that someone can say Nope under no circumstances would I want to sleep with someone of a particular gender regardless of other factors.

I pretty much strictly stay in smaller I guess you could say sub communities that are for just the people involved like bisexual people. Its not that I dont want to hang out with all LGBT people but so often I feel unwelcome. As far as labeling yourself as bi or queer its really only your business what you want to label yourself as. Ive seen some people use queer but not that many honestly. Some people are still uncomfortable with it and thats okay. Its still used against us LGBT people quite a bit at least where Im from so its totally understandable that many people dont use it. I dont understand how someone thought bisexual was obsolete? Ive seen it used a lot online. Maybe Im older than I thought!I dont see a problem with what youve said and this is coming from someone who could definitely be described as overly sensitive or easily offended by some people.

5363564,0,t3_3oh21h,I think that your title applies even in groups that are specifically bi. Including my local bi eventmeet group and this very subreddit. Im specifically attracted to distinct men and women who happen to have been born in matching bodies and Im attracted to each of those groups in very different ways. I would not say that I am fluid or that the meat surrounding a personality has no impact on my attraction. If I were only attracted to men I could find a support group of people that felt the same way and who could I could identify with and learn from without the need for abstraction. As it is every group Ive participated in with my nominal orientation is full of people who implicitly or explicitly tell me that my attractions and feelings are in fact misplaced and even a bit oppressive. At the very least its made clear that Im in the minority. Its pretty disheartening since I only accepted this side of myself  years ago and really could use the support of likeminded people. Absorbing bi into pan makes finding them via terminology almost impossible.,bisexual,cvx981q,10,t5_2qwnx

5412087,0,t3_3p4mij,Wow I was just like you growing up. I have  brothers so the teasing and fucking around with each other was nonstop and I was never a huge fan of it when I was younger. Plus Ive never liked sports very much or stereotypically guy video games like Halo or CoD. If I had to hang out with a guy it was always incredibly awkward for me. All my good friends from about th grade through high school were girls like basically exclusively. Then in college I met some just really cool guys who were so different from my brothers or the guys from high school. They teased but it was never as malicious or meanspirited. And it was always much less often than the real conversations we had or the nondeprecating jokes we would make. They liked sports a lot but we had other shared interests and they were generally just really great guys. I still consider one to be one of my best friends.So Id say find guys who make you feel comfortable you know? Not every guy is your stereotypical dudebro who punches you in the shoulder and objectifies women and rips on you nonstop. Were all just people and were all extremely varied so if you dont like the way a guy is treating you tell him and if he doesnt respond well stop hanging out with him. If its in a work setting I usually just shut my mouth and dont fully acknowledge shitty behavior.I hope this helps. There are some amazing people out there and you cant meet them all if youre closed off to half the population.

You dont need to make any decisions just yet as people can take years to figure out their sexuality. Slimjim also gave some good advice that bears reiterating  Porn gives a twisted view of what sex is really like and can be particularly harmful for younger people. Its important to know the person youre with and to understand that who you are having sex with is a human who should be getting the same amount of enjoyment from it as you are. Always use protection.

Most people IMO arent  straight and so it would totally free up those men who are confused about what their feeling to really figure it out and know theyre not alone. It also helps shatter the stereotypes about bi men.gt Do you feel inhibited by staying in the closet?Very much so.

5592459,0,t1_cwo224o,I apologise for my post if it does read as biphobic and bigoted. I come to bisexuality not out of fear phobia but out of total ignorance if you conflate the two thats your right. Im really not trying to claim at all that any bisexual should ever not come out or be open to their partner regardless of their degree of monogamy. I guess what I was exploring was the tension between those people who are bisexual and their nonbisexual partners who are almost inevitably not going to have the same degree of understanding that experience of bisexuality gives and how if? that gap can truly be overcome. Thats obviously going to require a degree of empathy towards bisexuality not unlike straight empathy towards homosexuality  a learned thing over time and learning because we are so steeped in a heteronormative and monogamous world. I guess my opening question could have been better framed as how can a bisexual snuff out biphobia and bigotry in people who are naive to bisexuality? I get that youre exasperated about having to argue the point with people and in a Utopia you wouldnt have to at all. Unfortunately being in a minority B of a minority LGBTQIA makes this a cross we all have to bear. That is of course until the bisexual commune opens and you can literally excommunicate all bigots and biphobes and live in total peace.

5959558,0,t1_cy0pp6v,Yeah unfortunately that tends to come from trans men not being very visible in the media at all to combat that stereotype. We still havent even fully removed the stereotype of trans women as a straight attracted to men ultra femmeacting woman either. The truth is there is a lot of genderpresentation variety in the trans community. There are butch lesbian trans women effeminate trans guys one guy floating around Reddit has a trans male lover who is particularly into crossdressing for sexual purposes masculine trans men feminine trans women androgynous men and women etc.Im glad it sounds like youre cool with all that though. Sometimes trans guys are afraid to be feminine even when thats truly how they feel because gender stereotypes suck. I cant tell you how often someone has tried to tell me that Im into  because you were born female. It doesnt matter that cis men do these same things it must be because Im trans. So yeah lots of femme trans guys are afraid to admit to their femme side because oh its because you were born a woman. Its...hard. Its hard to talk about these things without society placing negative values on things. Like trust me its never positive when someone goes oh its because youre trans its always someone playing the Gender Police and trying to prove how you arent a real man or a real woman.,bisexual,cy0tug5,3,t5_2qwnx

I am disappointed when I see anyone say that they dont want to align with feminism. Because I believe equal rights affect us all. How we behave how we accept how we live. To sit outside of feminism is allowing a small few idiots take over feminism and redifine it to their very warped standards. You know? We need to take the definition back and show it to be the moral and rational correct decision. We cant let them win. You need to think about it from a rational perspective too. Saying that you dont want to fight for this side because you think Im being too opinionated is also wrong. We all have opinions that we are all entitled to. But thats like fear mongering a woman with opinions into slience almost. We all have a right to an opinion. I feel very strongly about this subject because as a female bodied person who is nonbinary I have experienced inequality oppression sexism and misogyny.

Though I apologise for the ambiguous wording.That said this thread prompted a thought. The term natural ally might have some meaning even in the social justice context. uveiak says its an oxymoron. Perhaps it is if we view ally as a binary one is either an ally or not.If we view an allyship spectrum  some people are better allies than others  we might get a different meaning. Some people might be more educated more prone to introspection and more willing to make observation. This would be true before theyd even encountered the idea of being an ally.Given that some groups of people might tend towards those characteristics and some groups might tend away. You would find more fertile ally ground in some crescents than others.,bisexual,cytxbq1,2,t5_2qwnx

6239069,0,t3_40zyir,Hey! When I was  I met my girlfriend  and best male friend  at work. She lived in a party house near our college so almost every weekend she would throw a party. After about  years my guy friend invited me over to his apartment even though I was already at my girlfriends party. When I got there he was already in bed and wanted me to get in bed with him. I was so confused what was going on and wasnt thinking anything sexual so I did it. Nothing happened... We just cuddled for a couple hours until I felt awkward and left. That threw my world upside down. Was I straight or gay or Bi?? I know I was attracted to my girlfriend but I reallyyyyy wanted to mess around with my friend too. So I thought I was at least bicurious... When I was trying to hide my feelings of my bisexuality from myself I took to prescription medications blowing thousands of dollars each month on a lavish lifestyle not caring about my grades in college and drinking a lot. In my opinion the worst bad habit was that I was lying to my girlfriend by going to gay clubs and going home with random guys about once a week. I saw  psychologists that basically told me to cheat on her because there was No other way so I listened to them. I finally realized that I was just trying to repress my bisexuality and needed to accept it so I could stop all of my bad habits. I got caught cheating with a different friendcoworker who spread it around to all of my friends and coworkers and my girlfriend! It made me see my poor choices and understand that I would probably commit suicide or end up on the streets if I continued down this path of destruction. Now  I have completely changed my life around and realized whats important in life. I was able to make it up to my girlfriend who went to couples therapy so we could work everything out and be in a monogamous relationship. She has stuck with me for  years now and has been my wife for about  of those years. I have a great job doing what I love. I have a big beautiful house and wonderful lifestyle and absolutely amazing wife! I couldnt be much happier!  I am very comfortable with my bisexuality now too! Now the only people that I hide my bisexuality from is my coworkers at my new job and its not even really hiding it. Im calling it an Open Secret because Ive told anyone who asks but wont flaunt it around since others dont flaunt their heterosexuality in my face. LoL... The rare times when I feel like Im not feeling Bisexual enough Ill go to gay bars and clubs with my wife to drink and dance and have fun which reminds myself that there are others that are bisexual like me and Im not hiding anything and have nothing to be ashamed of or depressed about. I still often fantasize about sleeping with men and think about my bisexuality daily but Ive learned to accept myself for who I am and dont look upon it like a curse anymore.Although you definitely shouldnt be rushed into it maybe shes wondering if youre husband material so shes wanting to know if she can trust that you wont leave her or anything? Have you asked her why shes pushing you so much to do it?? And have you considered a threesome so shes there in case you need her or if you decide not to go thru with it so you can let them mess around and it not be really awkward? What do you want to do?Feel free to message me if you have any questions or want to talk more about it! ,bisexual,cyytcc7,2,t5_2qwnx

Try looking at it from that point of view you possess a great heart capable of loving anyone that truly and deeply touches your soul. As you get more comfortable in your newfound sexuality venture out to gay bars as they tend to be welcoming to everyone. I remember I use to frequent one with a basement cabaret and it was wonderful for meeting lots of people while seeing some fantastic entertainment. Pride events will help you network as well.

6487771,0,t3_44hw14,Most definitely! I have two that I love. One is the Vixen Creations Goodfella VixSkin Dildo which feels awesomely real. It is dual density so it feels soft outside but with a harder core for realism plus it is high quality silicone so easy to clean and safe. It is way better than any of the hard plastic kind. My second favorite is kinda like the Pipedream Products Icicles No . It is pyrex so super easy to clean and you could beat someone to death with it before breaking it. Which one I use depends on my mood. For context I am a married to a female bi guy who bottomed for a guy a few times about  years ago. Had a few other MM and MMF experiences since then but its been WAY too long! I tried a bunch of different dildos over the years to satiate that at least a little bit. The VixSkin probably feels as close as you can get without the real thing. The Goodfella also works with harnesses so my wife and I have had fun with that one together.  If you are trying to really go for the prostate then the pyrex one rocks.Be careful not to go cheap because many of those are made with questionable materials that after some time actually felt like it was burning.

If those attractions to women were genuine and important to you theyll return at some point.You need to get comfortable with your same sex attractions though. You have a bisexual brain not a straight one. Right now women are a continent explored and the novelty of men is probably more interesting to you.I was more strongly attracted to women in my teenage years and when I had a boyfriend for  years... towards the middle of that my preference swung more strongly towards men than it ever had in my life prior. To the point where straight porn held little to no interest for months at a time. You cant force it back all at once. Emotions dictate a large part of where your brain gravitates.

And I get what you mean as far as how you see it but the pull out couch thing to me is the same way. It is a couch and a bed. Sure its different in the ways it is and different in the way that it is both instead of just one but its still a bed and still a couch. Ill use a couch and Ill use a bed a pull out couch isnt like a completely different furniture at its core it is just different in the way that it is a bed and a couch. If that makes sense. Pretty much arguing over semantics at this point though. Again not trying to insult anyone or say anyone is a definitive way just saying how I view it so apologies if anyone took offense I dont mean it like that at all.

7318723,0,t1_d29t1fp,gt Jokes aside aesthetics of the flag dont really matter. It does when discussing why or why not you wear it on your person to me it does anyway.The I have anxiety around boys and girls shirt is really cute gosh.  I know its just wearing rainbows might then lead people to assume Im gay. I know this stuff doesnt matter. I KNOW it doesnt matter if people dont get it I know it doesnt matter if people mistake me for gay rather than bi. But from my perspective I dont want to wear special colours a symbol or a catchphrase about my sexuality unless people get it. Mostly because the aesthetics just dont appeal to me.If I wore a pink purple and blue bracelet and someone asked what does that mean? and I told them they are the bisexual colours I would be more worried about the response. I guess its just because of the negative reception of bi people well everywhere. Its generally met with judgement smirking people thinking they know better than you. So I know my preferences DO somewhat depend on what other people think I just dont want to be seen as that person. Im already that person for other reasons I dont need another one. I would rather wear symbols that mean something more to me like loving Harry Potter. I have a Harry Potter bracelet fuck loads of people have told me that its babyish but I dont care. However I feel like wearing something to do with bisexuality would result in more than just eye rolls.  Even then I dont really adorn myself with stuff that represents my personality.It has to do with my age too. Im in college and have never seen one single person apart from the girl with dyed hair wear LGBT related stuff and we have a huge LGBT society. I could be wrong but it seems like more of a teen thing.  Adorning yourself with symbols and stuff in general seems that way. THAT said if its your thing go for it whatever floats your boat.

7376879,0,t1_d2g0hpn,I kind of disagree with this advice. Protect your own mental health first for sure. If snapping off a friendship is what it takes to keep you sane do it. I would rather folks not do that though without giving a solid and patient attempt to change them. It might take many conversations over a period of time. Bisexual folks have abysmal rates of being out. Furthermore gay people really do sometimes come out as bi before declaring full gay as a way of sheltering themselves from the full stigma of being out and gay. LGBT folks and allies are not maliciously slandering bi folks because of biphobia. They believe what they say and they probably have personal anecdotes that they have personally seen or heard of from friends that inform thier opinions on bisexuality. Gay folks are fighting thier own fight against internalized homophobia that really does manifest sometimes as false bisexuality. They are focused on thier own good fight and can fail to see and understand the collateral damage they are doing to bi folks. They are not out to get us they are just ignorant. The truth is that there is only one cure. The path is clear. Gay folks blazed a trail. Trans folks are pretty successfully following that same trail right now to good effect. Trans folks which suffered the same sort of skepticism about thier sexuality are correcting that problem. Trans rights are on the rise. The ignorance on trans issues in the LGBT community that used to be high is receding. The path forward is engagement and coming out especially with LGBT folks who are going to be better allies when they understand us better. Getting rejected or running into ignorance and then immediately retreating especially with fellow LGBT folks is a sure way to never change anything. Jumping into the closet and rounding yourself to gay or straight just feeds the bad stereotypes. If we cant get LGBT folks on board we are fucked when it comes to the normals. We need to follow in the foot steps of the LGBT pioneers before us. Fight to the limit of your of your own sanity. I wouldnt start dropping friends especially LGBT friends who are far more likely to understand over thier ignorance until you cant tolerate it anymore. If we dont stand come out and fight a little nothing is going to change. Step one is to come out and get our natural allies in board not run from them and jump into the closet. Its easy to complain about ignorance and rejection but complaints and retreat wont fix anything. We need to face it head on and march forward. Frankly I think we have the easier task. Ill take convincing LGBT folks Im not gay over convincing straight folks in the s that it is okay to be gay and I wont rape thier children any day of the week. ,bisexual,d2gp7af,8,t5_2qwnx

7509761,0,t3_4i6nwo,This is all very Chasing Amy except in Chasing Amy she clearly was bi or homoflexible all along as she had loads of hetero sex before deciding to focus on being with women and didnt seem to really ever inwardly identify as gay and Ben Affleck is an asshole...so...okay its a terrible example...never mind. For starters identity is always so tricky in and out of the the LGBT community for nonmonosexuals. Bi people dont receive a lot of acceptance and were not talked about as much in media in general and when we are its usually negatively or a background character. So there is a lot of pressure for people who are bi to identify as gay or straight  sometimes people are very aware of that pressure sometimes it is internalized subconscious. She may have been bi all along but either wittingly or unwittingly chose to identify as gay to avoid the stigma of being labelled bi. There are also loads of people who are elsewhere on the sexual spectrum not strictly gay or straight but not really bipan either. They predominantly like one gender or the other and may have only a handful of attractions to someone who is not that gender in their whole life time. They may go years decades even thinking only one gender is an option for them then suddenly meet someone from the other gender or agendergenderqueer and be into them. Shit happens. Problem is we live in a world where people dont like nuance  and complexity  they want things to be black or white. They cant get that youre mostly a lesbian but bam happened to meet and fall for a man and really enjoy him in all ways or vice versa  if youve always had straight relationships and suddenly meet someone samesex and fall for them people want to say you were gay all along or bi but really you may be straight for literally everyone but this one person. Sexuality is complicated. People cant handle it. So they pressure people and people pressure themselves to fit into a box. Thirdly maybe it was an experiment for her not in a casual mean Im going to try you out and chuck you way more like a I feel this attraction and want to see where it goes way. Maybe their personalities meshed and the sex wasnt awful and for awhile she thought it was something longterm for her. But then she realized that either sexually or romantically she just wasnt compatible with the guy  which could have everything to do with her inherent sexuality or nothing to do with it. Straight people fall out of love with each other all the time for  reasons and are still straight. The fact she went back to being gay doesnt prove the relationship fell apart because she couldnt handle being with a man  it only proves she didnt want to be with this man. Were not her and we dont know her motivations nor do we know her side of the story only your friends. Overall yes anyone who identifies as something mostall of their life and then says hey wait maybe Im not that thing faces a difficult road. Whether it be the married guy with kids admitting hes gay at  or the  year old woman realizing she likes men and women after a lifetime of thinking straight is the default and she was staring at tits all day because of the nice blouses on them  people will express surprise disbelief shock and sometimes be outwardly cruel and judgmental because how dare you change the game on them or continue learning about yourself past .

7617745,0,t1_d3827o9,FWIW I didnt downvote you. I dont downvote people just because I disagree with them though I dont think we entirely disagree so much as are looking at this issue from different perspectives. What youre saying makes sense but to a point and only to a point. I dont need to be policed on how I relate to the world and neither does anyone else. Peoples feelings are valid whether they be forgiveness or anger and you dont get to decide theyre not. Nor do you get to smugly tell everyone they need to be the ambassador for their group. Youre welcome to that job if you want it but I and many others are tired of being put in a position for any reason to need to validate ourselves to others.gtThe straight up rejection of even thinking about how we can take action when confronted with ignorance is just sad. Also no one said they were doing this...My point is you have no right to judge people for losing their shit or walking away or being annoyed or sarcastic or however they choose to respond when they are repeatedly confronted with needing to justify their choices. I would posit I and most people are willing to play along to a point and are making a variety of split second decisions about the persons intent based on body language tone of voice etc and then from there deciding how to react. You may be a tireless martyr but most of us just cant take anymore at a certain point and we shouldnt have to. Im not an apologist. I dont like the this is just how people are and we need to stroke their egos and kindly ask for their opinions to sway in our favor because sugar makes the medicine go down and flies dont like vinegar etc cliche etc mentality. Stonewall was a riot not a bunch of people trying to politely explain to the police why they deserved the right to exist. While I and others may not be directly facing violence or arrest we are no less flat out being asked to explain why we exist or challenged that we even exist at all. Thats fucked up.

7645661,0,t3_4k0o9t,Im a bisexual women in NYC. My boyfriend is as straight as they come but very open minded. We are in our early s.  Coming out was scary especially because I had fallen hard for my boyfriend and we were madly in love. When I finally realized I was bi I processed that info for a couple weeks before telling him. I did not know how he would react and what it would do to our healthy relationship. Luckily we both take a very accepting approach to life and people we also have about  years of continuous sobriety between the two of us and he was surprised but happy for me for coming into myself and this part of me that I had discovered. He has dated and been friend bisexual women previously and had already come to the understanding that it has nothing to do with the faithfulness of a person or loyalty to a relationship.What a relief that whole experience was for me! Now we continue our very healthy relationship and actually live a bit of a poly lifestyle I date women in addition to our relationship he is friends with them and sometimes we adventure together if the situation is right. Communication connection and our ability to identify and manage our feelings of jealously has brought us into a deeper level of our relationship. Good luck with writing!,bisexual,d3b9quo,6,t5_2qwnx

7815122,0,t3_4mb0r4,For meM it was a gradual process in a few stages. Denial Confusion Shame Acceptance PrideI didnt grow up in a religious household or anything like that but coming from a family of all boys there were lots of gay jokes thrown around so I learned at a young age it was something bad and to be ridiculed.  I spent most of high school assuming I was straight and denying any thoughts I had for other guys or playing mind games with myself to avoid it.In college I couldnt avoid it anymore and was just really confused since I could no longer deny my feelings for other guys but I still found girls attractive.  At this point I didnt even realize bi was an option no one ever talked about it and if they did it was the typical stereotype of oh he is just gay and denying it.I started experimenting to try to figure these things out but I felt strong selfshame like I was doing something very wrong and very dirty and hated myself for it.  As I had more and more same sex experiences that started to fade but I was still embarrassed by it and was terrified of a friend or family member finding out.I struggled with negative feelings about myself and still with the internal struggle to figure out if I was straight or gay for a while then one day I just had the realization that like hey what if Im bi? and it all just clicked.  I stopped worrying about whether I was straight or gay.  Up until this point I had also been struggling with some pretty heavy depression and entered an intensive therapy program that really really helped.  Sometimes I wonder if being depressed was holding me back from accepting my sexuality or if denying my sexuality was increasing my depression. For those interested cognitive behavioral therapy with a little dialectical behavioral therapy was the approach that worked for me after years of therapy and medications not really helping muchAnyways once I accepted to myself Im bi it took a while for me to stop feeling ashamed for having those feelings.  A few things happened after that to make me feel proud and not embarassed of my sexuality when I first started dating my girlfriend I told her I was bi and she was totally fine with it and we were able to talk about hot guys and whatnot.  She was the first person I could really talk to about being attracted to guys and just being able to talk about it out loud to another human was huge.  Recently finding this sub THANK YOU EVERYONE has really helped me to be proud of being a bisexual man.  Being able to share the experiences of others that had similar struggles or to hear experiences of people who took a different path to the same destination has validated myself and given me perspective.Im still not totally out coworkers my family and most of my friends dont know.  Since Im in a long term relationship with a member of the opposite sex I now struggle with figuring out when and how to come out to the people that matter to me or if I should just not say anything unless it comes up.Sorry for the super long post but it feels good to talk about it.  Hopefully OP can avoid the years of selfdoubt and floundering that I experienced by having a bipositive community like this to help talk these feelings out!,bisexual,d3uhflm,5,t5_2qwnx

Knowing what you know of their conditional relationship  youre cool as long as youre straight?!Or do you want to move on and begin anew?   Even though the wounds hurt and hurt deeply.Its easy for us whom are not emotionally invested online here to say leave all of that behind and start new friendships.What I will suggest to you is gather your thoughts and perhaps write in a letter to all of them describing what you shared here.  How you opening up a personal side of yourself to entrusted friends to discover that not only that they dont appreciate that share.  But worse engage in behavior that you would have never imagined from them.Its one thing to be surprised by someone coming out its an entirely different scenario to disregard years of friendship because you trusted them as confidants.Were those friendships all a facade?

If anything theres evidence that society thinks the opposite that bi people are obsessed with men think of the stereotype that says that bi women are just faking it for attention and will just end up with men this stereotype being lobbed at us by both straight people and far too often lesbians and then the stereotype that bi guys are lying and are actually gay. In both instances the idea is that both bi women and bi men are really only interested in men! Obviously this stereotype is wrongheaded and offensive and I think the oppositethat bi people are more interested in women overall is also false.

I then chose to forget about part of my attractions samesex because since nobody acted on them I thought that was some sort of social code that everyone was attracted to the same sex but you just didnt act on it.It was only later...when I was about ...and this is really stupid but at the time I was hung up on a reality tv series and there was someone there that I identified with and they later said they were gay..so I had a huge moment in my head oh fuck then Im gay too...no wait...I still like boys dont I? Yup yup I do. Ok then Im bisexual.. So it took like seconds to accept it after realizing. I was actually really proud and never embarrassed of my sexuality. It was just like lifting a veil and being honest with what I already knew I was but had been blocking for so long.So I was proud. Never ashamed. The difficult part came after when I realized that society was not accepting at all. And even later when I realized that gay circles were not inviting and that I would never feel home there which I really craved. So now I follow a lonely but proudkind of attitude unfortunately!?

8310865,0,t1_d5ge5th,Hey there!! Honestly how it started was my friend who is a girl kept flirting with me in front of him and well everyone. And so inevitably the topic came up and I awkwardly told him that I would experiment with her if I could feeling bad the whole time because I thought hed be jealous. But he actually wasnt and told me he would want me to feel okay talking about that. He said he doesnt get jealous over other girls because to him its different than going out and fucking another guy. Which it is! Its completely different because its going out and experimenting sexually with someone of a different gender to validate your feelings so you can move on with your life feeling secure about your sexuality. Also he says that women he has talked to have said that women do something for them that a man could never do for them. He has a few lesbian friends so it seems legit. I made sure that he would be  comfortable with it and he made sure I would be too that I wouldnt feel guilty and such and I ended up literally just bringing it up to the girl one day when we were hanging out and she went Really??? Are you serious?????? I never thought youd ask me!! So really a lot of things just kind of fell into place. The best advice I can give is dont be scared of talking about it with your SO because they may surprise you and be totally supportive. But if theyre not trying to explain how sexually it is very different and its important for your emotional and mental health is a great way to try to get them to understand.

I just let them make assumptions.Right now Im living with my boyfriend hes actually the first and only guy Ive ever been with so most people probably just think Im gay. So I let them. It just makes life way easier. Its nice not having to correct people when you dont give a shit. Actually my boyfriend is usually the one who does the correcting on my behalf. I didnt get the whole bisexual thing until later on in life but he knew he was gay from about age  apparently. He tells me some pretty crazy stories about the shit he had to put up with in highschool so now a days hes pretty militant about a lot of that stuff. His sexual identity is pretty tightly wrapped up into who he is as a person because hes had to defend it for so longWhen I was in highschool I was straight or at least it was easy to convince myself and played football and stuff. So I always just kind of coasted along and never got angry or passionate about anything. I guess Im still like that in a lot of ways. Its just easier not to care what other people think.I dont know I think both approaches have their merit and benefits so I dont really know if I should be more vocal about my sexuality or not but I do know that not giving a shit either way probably saves me a lot of drama. Who knows though maybe one day Ill face a real bigot and my militant side will come out. That is if my boyfriend doesnt beat me to it lol.  ,bisexual,d65p1jn,7,t5_2qwnx

No one calls purple paint half red and half blue its just purple which is its own color. Its whole is greater than the sum of two parts.To say bi people are straight and gay fails to recognize the experiences that are unique to bisexuals. The experience of growing up gay is different than bi as a bi guy it was very easy for me to deny and ignore and pretend to be straight. It was also very tough to figure out my sexuality because no one really talked about bisexuality as a real thing so I didnt know there was an option other than gay or straight. Straight people dont have to question their sexuality or really think about it at all. Homosexual people have a very different experience too.

Definitely dont rush things.My first experience with a guy was just a hookup that I had because I felt like I needed to try gay sex like RIGHT THEN for some reason.

8745194,0,t1_d6y5pm1,This so much this.  There is no real difference between bi and pan.  Every description Ive read on the difference has come down to trying to argue that pan people are more open minded or progressive or whatever because they include genders outside the binary.  So really the argument for pan is ignorance on the definition of bi.The one definition that didnt make me rage was bi people are attracted to gender x for x reasons and gender y for y reasons while pan people are attracted to people of any gender for z reasons. Which I interpreted as bi people are attracted to different aspects in different genders while pan people are attracted to one set of things no matter what gender its in.  The problem with that is... you are still attracted to multiple genders so youre bi.  Pan is just clarifying the way you experience that attraction.By pan people separating themselves from bi they weaken our voice within the LGBTQ community and the population at large. We face the same issues we need to stand together to make those things heard instead of having pissing matches over semantics and labels and fighting each other.,bisexual,d6yswrz,6,t5_2qwnx

In undergrad I began to have my first serious i.e more than a drunk make out with friends experiences with other girls but even then i never actually came out and said anything about my sexuality and also kept these experiences pretty secretive. Now i am in a graduate program with a lot of accepting people at a new school and I decided to try to own it.  I came out to my best friends from undergrad and none of them were that surprised although saying it out loud is kind of shocking. Over the last year I have casually mentioned it to some of my classmates when lgbtq discussions arise our class is full of advocates for a variety of marginalized communities so it is decently common and people are very accepting and positive.  It is so good to feel like I can say that and people just take it as normally as if I stated my ethnic background. over time the more comfortable you get and the easier it is to talk about and it also allows you to live less inhibitedly... not a word but you know what i meancongratulations on this step lt ,bisexual,d7mrpjf,3,t5_2qwnx

9210225,0,t3_56gpx5,I dont think its a question any of us can really answer since everyone views dating and sex differently. I will explain how it is for me which might be how your boyfriend feels. However I want to first explain a few things. First there is nothing wrong with how you feel. If you have personal boundaries in a relationship talk to him about it and let him know what they are. Its a normal thing to discuss and everyone has boundaries that are too far. He likes you and respects you which is why he is talking it through to you. For me Sex can be a good way to relieve stress and have fun and more intimate like with a partner. I enjoy having it with different people but nothing compares to having sex with my longterm partner. Men give a very different experience from women and I still want to have that but ultimately its my partner that I really enjoy and want to go back to. Even if he has sex with a guy he can still be loyal and love sex with you on a different level. This might be incompatible with what you want and its something to talk about with him. You might only be okay with threesomes and that is perfectly okay,bisexual,d8jgqlb,3,t5_2qwnx

I couldnt feel anything for women either until I started considering I may have some hatred towards what it means to be a woman. Likewise its worth thinking about why you dont feel yourself sexually objectifying a man. I mean in our society women are so sexually objectified that its easy to see them that way. Where as looking at a guys body and thinking about what makes masculinity attractive is harder and different becauseunfortunately mens bodies are not celebrated as sexual beauty  think about the amount of movies you see where the camera shows off a man as beautiful over just mechanical. But if youre really not that into penis or flat chests or muscle or lots of body hair... Well then its clear.Thats my two cents as I work through this confusing set of emotions.

Further given uBreathOfHearts is bi its somewhat unlikely hes engaging in bi erasure to presume that that the guy is gay despite coming out as bi. If thats not true I agree with uTheAeonWorm that its a bit shitty to erasure his sexuality even if you suspect hes lying.I do think though its fair to be pissed at people who pretend to be bi but are actually gay.I think we can have empathy for them and their choices.I think we can say that its fair that they dont suffer any negative consequence for choosing protecting themselves in this likely ineffectual and counterproductive way.I think we can think that theyve made a legitimate decision.Nonetheless we can still be pissed that a decision theyve made had screwed us over. We can also direct that annoyance in their direction and tell them the factual statement that their decision has made our lives worse.Being aware that someone has been a bit shitty doesnt mean we cant have empathy for why. We can choose to forgive indeed we should because their decision whilst regrettable was legitimate. But that doesnt mean forgetting.I dont think any of those things are mutually exclusive.

10390984,0,t3_5ot1tc,When I first was questioning if I was bi I had this idea that I had to be specifically attracted to a specific girl and have a longterm crush before I could be sure. I had never had a crush on a girl up until then mid high school so I told myself I was just making it up for attention except I never told anyone so...I wanted my own attention?? My thought process was strange. However though Id never had a crush on a girl at that point Id had maybe one longterm crush on a boy. I just didnt get crushes very often. In summer camp one of my friends was questioning her sexuality and talking to a bi friend about it and listening to the bi friends descriptions and advice somehow made it click for me that I didnt need to prove to myself that I was bi I knew I was and had known it for a while. Several years later I am in a serious relationship with a girl and am most certainly attracted to girls  sexuality is fluid and labels should make you feel comfortable but I think that you seem bi to me and it should be something you can be open with your bf about.,bisexual,dclvtkm,3,t5_2qwnx

In her mind shes spinning it into this whole other narrative of he will play with boys but he will end up with a woman and convincing herself of those lies.The way she reduces your same sex attractions down to the word cute definitely isnt cute.Dump her for a dude and then take a picture of her face just as she finds out.

I feel pretty similarly to you  currently in a LTR with a woman. I had read this really intense thread on a lesbian sub about lesbians who wanted to protect the label to exclude women like us. The rationale was there is no other term to identify women strictly into other women and the harmful stereotype of being able to turn a lesbian straight ugh. While i dont think its dishonest to call yourself a lesbian  you are functionally a lesbian lol  at least be aware of the stereotypes and the arguments for why people have a problem with women like us using the label lesbian. Personally i choose to id as bi it fits me better and is a better reflection of my past dating history BUT while i personally dont think youd be wrong or dishonest if you tried posting this on a lesbian sub youd have both supporters and haters and i think its important to take all of that into account as you navigate your experience.

11147888,0,t3_5z5wgu,NSFW...I hadnt come out to myself yet it took  years after this. I was a cocky  year old. It was Valentines Day so all the guys I lived with and myself being single and straight we decided to get drunk together to celebrate our freedom from relationships read commiserate because we were all alone. At am wed all been drinking for over  hours and were sloshed. I was in great shape so I was wearing my boxer briefs and an open robe because Im an exhibitionist at heart and theres no holding it back when Im drunk. All but one of my roommates decides its time for bed so me and him stay up drinking. Its all kind of hazy but he complimented my body in some way and it ended up with me making a flirty joke implying he had a small dick because of his height he was only . He called bullshit told me his was probably bigger than mine and told me hed whip it out if I would. Not believing hed do it I agreed and he pulled it out and got himself hard. Never one to back down from an agreement I did the same even though my heart was beating out of my fucking chest. I couldnt believe it I was so determined I wasnt attracted to guys but I hadnt ever seen anything as hot as him sitting there stroking his cock.So there we are pumping away at our dicks in front of each other he wasnt lying he had a great dick and somehow sucking dick gets brought up. Next thing I know Im on my knees with a dick in my mouth for the first time. After a while he started to blow me until partway through I just say fuck me. He looks up at me and asks if Im serious and I nod. Next thing I know my legs are up by my ears and hes pounding away at my ass. I wasnt relaxed we only had spit for lube and he had a pretty big dick so I was in a lot of pain. That being said... I loved it and Im not a masochist. The things he was saying to me and the noises he made were so hot it made up for all the pain. Plus the feeling of his weight on top of me... Anyways we were both too drunk so neither of us could come but that didnt stop him from giving it to me for what felt like or might have been hours. We only stopped because we heard our roommates waking up. He reverted to straight status when we woke up and nothing happened between us again but despite the alcohol induced haze and sleep deprivation that night was unforgettable.,bisexual,devlniw,24,t5_2qwnx
11154790,0,t3_5z9les,As someone who realized they were bi at  and in a committed relationship I want to say that your wife does not have any excuse to step outside of your relationship let alone marriage and she is indeed sabotaging things. Some couples come to the mutual decision that one partner or both can experiment sexually with other people to help them assess the situation further. When this decision is made alone by one party without the other persons consent it might as well be cheating. Sure she may be going through a rollercoaster of emotions discovering this about herself but that does not give her the right to completely walk all over you and disregard you as her partner and husband. This is not normal OP. I hope you can get her to sit down with you to discuss things. Best wishes.,bisexual,dewdtpd,29,t5_2qwnx
11163282,0,t1_dex23fv,It sounds like shes both scared to be gay for fear of hurting you and scared to suppress her potentially gay side any longer for fear of living a lie. Even though its not okay by any means you cant force her to stay monogamous with you and be satisfied with acting straight. I remember when I first realized I was bi. It took me about a year to get a woman in bed and the sexual tension that built up was awful. I felt like I was a bad gay if I had only ever had straight experiences. You worry if youre going to hate it or be bad at it and the fear can be crippling. Im surprised my boyfriend could put up with me in that state. I dont think I was attracted to him for a bit during that year maybe a couple months. Its just really consuming. Your entire psyche is screaming because you had repressed these urges for so long until you finally let yourself feel them and then the floodgates of your attraction towards women opens up and its hard to remember your attraction to your partner in the midst of it. The only thing you can do is talk it out. I know this is equally hard for you to go through and Im not saying you have to be the strong one here but talk to her. Listen to what shes saying. Figure out what you can handle. Can you be in a marriage where your wife also fools around with other women? Can you loosen the reigns so to speak and maybe have an open marriage? If the answers are no then thats okay. Tell your wife that. But you cant force her to be okay with monogamy just as much as she cant force you to be okay with polyamory. ,bisexual,dexch30,2,t5_2qwnx

11181094,0,t3_5zcjba,Insecurity.  I am bisexual and I am socially dominant and seem like a straight male ego type to most.  Most straight men that I know will immediately go there and they do it because they feel threatened by the fact that women might still prefer you as a bisexual man over them.  That and as a bi guy I respond to accusations of being gay with I am better than gay or straight I am both of you and youre orientations are sort of like a mental retardation of the sexual orientations in comparison.  I mean gay men and straight men think they are better than each other and better than us.  So basically playing their trump card they use on each other and us on both of them is fair game.  I also like to continue on with the I only date bi people too and the closest you could come to a beautiful bi woman is pornhub etc.  To hell with both of them.  Gay men often play the same exact card with us and I dont care about their lispy homophobia queen tantrums after doing it to them.Men have male egos.  Even if you dont have a male ego give it right back to them.  Straight men will be benevolent homophobes at times where they pull this crap because gay men will often say the same about us bisexuals.  So it is BOTH of them. ,bisexual,dezd4oo,1,t5_2qwnx

11277995,0,t3_60yhtb,Just curious why do you feel that way? I think you have more fellow LGBT allies out there than you think. I promise you arent alone.  But I can also see how it is hard to accept being anything other than heterosexual especially if you are linked to a religion that condemns homosexuality of any kind. I grew up in a pretty conservative Christian home so I know how it feels for people around you to make you not proud of who you are. But I realized my happiness didnt rely on their close mindedness. I felt awful trying to conform into someone I wasnt. I didnt like having feelings for girls because I grew up being told that being gay was gross and wrong. It wasnt until college that I finally accepted that I was bisexual. Once I accepted it and lived my life as I truly was I am happy to say I am bisexual and proud of it! Wouldnt change a thing.  Im sorry you feel that you cant be proud of who you are but Ive been there. It can be hard but just remember you have a community here full of people just like you.  ,bisexual,dfaceky,2,t5_2qwnx

I am in a poly thing with  bi women and a bi guy and I tend to be at home more dominated by the women but in public one of the women and I will be rather dominant  We take off when they start PMS and screaming and yelling all week and well I make sure that hes taken care of. People use a misogynistic slur that starts with a C to describe me and one of the gfs.  our other girlfriend sometimes tries to get along with poly groups and bi community stuff.  She went off at this rainbow flag thing and we were angry that she got us with pity.

I was only out to five people I was vague with everyone else but I was so fully committed to the social label of being gay that I knowingly suppressed my feelings towards women. The worst part is that there were girls that I really liked who were showing genuine interest in me that I ignoredpushed back because of my confusion.

11348522,0,t3_61xgpr,This story is so sweet and pure hahah. Thank your lucky starts not many people get to have a bond like that Anywaygt At least sometimes. I dont like other guys much. The thought of having sex with a guy grosses me out and I could never see myself being in that position. I think guys look fine from the neck down and sometimes get a really minor sexual attraction to them but not enough for me to know for sure. Some days he may look slightly more masculine and it reminds me that hes a guy and turns me away a bitIs there a reason You can pinpoint why do You feel grossed out about the idea of sex with guys??? like is it a possible smell? fear of stds? the concept in general? Another question... Is it any sex with guys or only anal sex? Because orientation is related to behaviour but it doesnt prescribe it. A guy can be gay or bi and not dig anal or dig it but not be able to do it due to medical conditions a girl can be lesbian and not like giving oral a straight girl may hate getting breast stimulation from her bf and so on. Perhaps You find only a particular activity gross and it comes up immediately when You try to think about sex with other guys.Erotic activities with guys may encompass Kissing licking nibbling ears neck or other parts erotic massages manual stimulation handjobs and fingering mutual or not nipple play bitting sucking pinching frot rubbing penises and balls together intercrural one person slides their dick in and out between their partners thighs and perineum intergluteal sliding the dick between the buttocks with no penetration oral blowjobs andor rimjobs anal sex and finally kink activities BDSM and the like. As You can see many options. You may like all of those most many or only a few. Any outcome is valid.gt Hes such a better person compared to me that I just feel ashamed and guilty or even thinking about being with himWhy feel guilty though? Why not feel honored instead to have a bond with him and spending time together?.... I mean if Youre close and he has taught You to have a different outlook and the like it would not be too crazy to assume that he digs sharing time with You is it?  Perhaps he sees something special in You as well and Youre not aware of it regardless if his appreciation of You is platonic or beyond that. ,bisexual,dfic1i6,3,t5_2qwnx

11615367,0,t3_65rcyo, I think you said it best yourself it all boils down to your own insecurity. Would you feel any different if she was straight even though she may find attraction to other men besides you? Probably not. But for some reason when she says that shes attracted to both men and women you see her as potentially being attracted to twice the amount of people as she would be if she were straight. I think you feel like that means shes more likely leave you because she has more options for her to explore. This isnt the case though. Many bi sexual people have only been in straight relationships but that doesnt make them any less bi. There isnt a threshold you have to do he have the bisexual label. The truth is many bisexuals fall on to a spectrum but feel that since they have some attraction to the opposite gender they should identify from that. There isnt anything wrong with that either. If you trust her then her sexuality shouldnt be a problem. If that trust isnt there then perhaps you two should sit and have a conversation about it. ,bisexual,dgcm1l1,10,t5_2qwnx
