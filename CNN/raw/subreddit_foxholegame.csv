9155973,0,t1_d8cipt6,But that makes all objects easily removeable. I think I can agree with you with my proposition. That players can build a weak road block item on the road only. You cant put a sandbag or concerte wall on a road. Such as the wooden wall for a road block is great   rifle rounds and poof gone. Sandbags and concrete walls were annoying as hell to deal with it. C is required for those and  mats is not easy to come by plus the C build time.,foxholegame,d8cl3jn,1,t5_3ejda

10183849,0,t1_dbydc3r,No. Where you can hear your squadmates but only the squad leader can hear commanders. Commanders can hear each other. But only give orders to Squad Leaders.I think it is the ACRE mod for Teamspeak .,foxholegame,dbye93z,1,t5_3ejda

11235486,0,t3_60d3pm,If there is a Great road like there used to be id love to see it in the middle with roads leading to both sides towns like it is right now. This will be more interesting now however since both teams will fight for them equally! Loved the rocks and hills on colonial side but really disliked the swamp on the warden side so it would be nice if there are such as now open fields but with small choke points  supply cut offs  FOB  opportunities for the opposing teams. There could also be a town or two in the middle that both teams would have to fight for as the main choke points with hills  big fields on the sides which will make them easily vulnerable and flankable. I would also like to see Big scrap fields  components yards at the mountain parts winter ones located north which will make them useful there could also be a road leading through the mountain pass to each side of the map as a small infantry route. Do not make huge mountains  rocks climbable since that kinda ruins the gameplay such as in deadlands... However smaller less over powered rocks  ridges could be nice to see as it will give more dynamic fights to the battle. Would love to see small little huts  buildings around the entire map which will give the infantry come cover  a place to setup when flanking enemy lines something like the pumpkin fields but for more cover and in a lot more useful spots. I loved how open this map was along with a lot of other players so i hope it stays open so its unique to the other maps! Would love to hear more suggestions thank you for your time reading this long post! Hope it was useful or it helped in any way  !,foxholegame,df5iz34,1,t5_3ejda

If youve done something to earn commends then youve proven you have contributed to the team and you didnt just join to grief or spy.  This at least prevents griefing on the original team you started on.  ,foxholegame,dglxxiu,1,t5_3ejda
