217587,0,t1_cex6xjc,For the life of me I cannot seem to find the files anywhere though Id be happy to share them if they do happen to turn up. When I taught it I had a big enough class to have  tributes from each of  districts but I allowed them to pair up with each other based on sets of character traits they had each selected  a set number of virtues and a set number of vices.I was playing a lot of Total War when I did this yes...Everybody had access to character sheets of everybody else so they knew who they were dealing with. They would spend each week I went through the book very slowly I think we did it in  weeks because I had a lot of activities brainstorming scenarios in which they would help each other out as a team and as creative writing exercises come up with ways to find and overcome the other tributes based on their character traits and how vices and virtues complemented each other. It...went okay. We had some neat discussions about how certain character traits meant something or another.,ELATeachers,cf387ue,2,t5_2vvc8

1170915,0,t1_ci1905q,Hi my name is Mr.  and I just wanted to get an idea of who you all are so before I start Im just curious where the different kinds of students are. Theres always certain types in every classroom and I want to know who you are. So whos like the smart one you know the student that always knows the answer always has their HW done and if someone was going to cheat not that any of you would do such a thing! they would cheat off this person. Where are you? Theres always at least one! Raise your hand. Ahhh I see and whats your name? ok ok good thank you. Now for the second kind of student suspense pause the shy student! And I definitely know theres one of you! I was a shy student so I see right through your attempt to slouch in your chair and remain hidden. Oh! Im hearing some people say names but remember I dont know your names! I guess you better point but always remember that when you point you point  fingers back at yourself!. Ok and whats your name? Great now...as you know I was a shy student so Im really sorry to have put you on the spot and I wont do it again but I just wanted to know where ma brothas and sistas are! And now for the final type of student that I know every classroom has...the loud student said ominously. You know the one who sometimes just cant help but shout out the answer or when everyone is doing one thing he or she is just doing the opposite hey its not always a bad thing I just have to satisfy my own curiosity because I know every classroom has one! Ah Ok and whats your name? Thanks! So now that I know I want to get started and just so you know since I already knew there were certain kinds of students here I totally planned so that all of you could work how you want but first I need to tell you what were doing!NotesI maybe went into too much detail with this script but it was the best way I could think to convey the idea. Obviously using a script is a bad idea because the point is to be lively and interactive mixing in jokes and pulling attention. The basic idea in this routine is to get students to self identify or identify others who have certain common personality traits. I used Smart Shy and Loud but you could use whatever. The bonus to it is that I identify who I can call on when I want something to really further the discussion who I should probably just leave alone and check on individually and who I want to preempt for any behavior issues. In the lesson I did it worked out to my advantage because I couldnt get the white screen to stay down and the teacher said ya well give you a million bucks if you figure it out so I said hmmm...I have an idea...Larry! the one who identified himself as disruptive. He was up and moving in a second everyone got a laugh and he felt like he had been recognized positively. Of course I told him I was joking but that his enthusiasm was awesome.So key points are. Do something that is about them requires participation and is not related to content. Mix in information about yourself. Be lively move around make jokes...be goofy. Put everyone that answers in a positive lightOh and I wouldnt recommend this specific routine for anything over th grade. I mean if I did this in a senior class Id expect poor results.And some general advice. There were  administrators and  teachers watching my lesson they took up the whole back row. I quickly ignored them and tried to completely forget they were there.Hope this helps and good luck.,ELATeachers,ci1cjwq,1,t5_2vvc8

I always say to the kids. Im concerned for your longterm wellbeing. I understand that in the short term you want to sleep andor work to get paid. But in the long term you need knowledge of self and awareness about the world and skills like writing effectively.. Im having a conversation with the current year   version of you. And right now the  version of you is yelling at me Dont let me sleep or slack off!The first year is incredibly tough especially when  as is obviously the case with you  the teacher cares very much. Just remember that teaching is largely an iterative process. You will probably only have each student for a year or a semester but youll learn how to do things better next time so dont lose sight of what you need to learn because youre too busy beating yourself up about how you did it wrong this time.Again Good luck!,ELATeachers,ckotf5l,2,t5_2vvc8

3458501,0,t3_2zuspu,Having been one of those writers as well as a teacher having to deal with those writers I  think the most effective way to address this problem is directly. Tell the students that you appreciate how theyre making the effort to sound academic but let them know when its counterproductive.  Emphasize clarity and economy of language over eloquence because thats the type of writing we use outside of academic papers.Perhaps present them with a sample paper written in this style for them to critiqueedit then when theyre done ripping it apart reveal that many of them commit the same mistakes.,ELATeachers,cpmhtaw,8,t5_2vvc8

4679529,0,t3_3dbw7b,I know Im late to the game on this one but I personally like doing geographic units maybe because I love Southern literature so much. I think it helps students pick up on commonalities among authors of a certain region and because authors influence the writing that comes after them you are able to touch on chronological building of themes writing styles ideas etc. When I do regional lit I tend to do it chronologically so that is a way to still do something that may make more sense to you but also be able to jump around a bit so that you can share resources with others.For one of my favorite regional units we study the appearance of the gothic and the grotesque in Southern lit read Flannery OConnor Faulkner Raymond Carver and Capote short stories. We also look at Southern music the presence of agrarian ideals in lit poetry and music of the region and writing assignments can vary from a simple compare and contrast of the writers of the region to analysis of common themes or symbols e.g. foodcommunion xenophobia religion etc.. You said something about how Into the Wild doesnt have a companion thematically. You could use letters from explorers and pioneers short stories that center around the region or around the idea of going wild excerpts from Walden Pond or even tie in the Europeans coming to the New World to begin with what propels people to move away and start over. There is also the book The Bean Trees. Im just brainstorming here so sorry if it seems random. I also teach th grade so Im asking myself these same questions about thematic vs. chronological vs. regional!,ELATeachers,ctkehod,1,t5_2vvc8

The rumors swirl about me being a vampire eating children under the school etc. Therefore I give them the assignment to create a story to meet me any place they want except school.  Sometimes I am in  Transylvania visiting my children. Occasionally  I am at Starbucks sipping what appears to be coffee but no one is certain. I have even been in Munchkin Land attending my sisters funeral I live in Kansas so the witch jokes are also prevalent.. However this assignment lessens the irrational fear the students have of the Teacher from the Black Lagoon or other nightmares. They tend to enjoy my bad jokes and see that kids spread silly stories to terrify each other. I also tend to be a school favorite. Have fun!! Side note Fifteen years ago I was a GTA and this type of assignment for my Comp II. class. Unfortunately one of my students met me on the beach. He had me on the beach in a sting bikini.

Shell criticize something that I do but wont explain beyond that. Shes mad at me for saying that I would be comfortable with doing her english II prep but not taking on her english III as well. She agreed to that without expressing any concern on her part until my supervisor came in and then described the field as being only okay so far because of my comfort levels Ive explained to her and my school that I am recently diagnosed with panic disorder and it becomes significantly worse when I am overwhelmed. Right now I am in my first ever student teaching experience with little guidance from my CT  my comfort level with building  days of lessons around this curriculum without an idea of scope or sequence from her only what is offered from engage NY is difficult for me because although its all outlined there its a lot to take in without any experience. She seems to think Im lazy and just dont want to take both her preps and because she never student taught I guess she thinks that I should be able to act as a teacher without any help.
