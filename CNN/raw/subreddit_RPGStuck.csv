Everything that does not have to do with Sburb may be considered as canon conversations between friends. Please ask a DM if a specific part of your conversations may be canon if you are unsure. Like for example planning to meet up or threatening to declare war on a neighboring country is canon. Talking about Sburb is canon. When people start possessing and downloading Sburb everything beyond that point is not canon.TLDR everything but future self interactions and owning Sburb may be considered cannon. Your characters may have heard about Sburb but they cannot own a copy of the game or obtain a copy through any means.Edit All of this is barring DM shenanigans also other DMs correct me if I am wrong.,RPGStuck,cpiqtw2,3,t5_37dmy

7119683,0,t1_d1nf5f5,usilverleaf oops accidentally hit sendVV It turns out that the alternate version of Nick wanted to wreak havoc which only exacerbated the circumstances. Alternate Nick also has a mask of his own a mask which he used in part to murder nearly everyone. Because the mask resisted alternate Nicks efforts to completely absorb and effectively kill the mask alternate Nick wanted a different mask that was unaware of his previous committed atrocities.vvVV He found Lyra while she was asleep and swapped the masks. This mask alternate Nick planted on her had previously engaged in a perfectly reasonable written contract with alternate Lyra. In a timeline of complete and utter desperation when nearly everyone else was dead and she was one of the only hopes left she made a pact with the mask to receive powers to defeat alternate Nick in exchange for giving up her soul.vvVV She sacrificed herself for the session in a lastditch effort to save everyone. Unfortunately it failed and alternate Lyra was slain. Lyra herself saw this happen. Alternate Nick found Lyra and transported her through time to watch him murder her alternate self.vvVV The mask alternate Nick planted was unaware of the fact that alternate Nick had traveled timelines so upon finding itself with Lyra again it immediately jumped to the conclusion that Lyra had faked her own death and was attempting to weasel her way out of rules and technicalities as she often does.vvVV This in fact was completely false because of the switch alternate Nick had performed and instead sent both Lyra and the mask into a uproar neither aware that the switch had happened. Lyra attempted to sue the mask in a dubious court setting with another sentient objet under my possession presiding as judge.vvVV Lyras case although it had some merit had little to no concrete evidence to support her claims and her constant yelling and arguing nearly got her case thrown out of court before she could even accomplish anything meaningful.vvVV I was brought onto the scene served as her lawyer in the case and made a case for her insanity thereby nullifying any contracts she had engaged herself in since the time of becoming insane. The case succeeded and she was freed from her binds.vvVV However in the process it became clear to the maskwhich is still the one alternate Nick plantedthat this was not the same timeline in which it originated and that it had been incorrect in attempting to force Lyra to fulfill her end of the contract that she never made.vvVV It also saw a drastic difference in personality between the two Lyras. The alternate Lyra being very pessimistic and fatalistic but still willing to sacrifice herself whereas this Lyra had just been proven legally insane on a number of counts and had an uncanny willingness and perhaps enjoyment of experiencing pain and loss.vvVV It proceeded to explain the confusion but Lyra would hear none of it. She continued yelling at the mask and nearly got thrown out of court yet again. She attempted to torment the mask and pressure it into completely unreasonably demands to make amends for its mistake.vvVV This combined with the horrible guilt and experiences it had already seen in being used without its consent by alternate Nick to murder many people resulted in a great deal of emotional strife. Despite the fact that it was clear it was an accident Lyra was convinced it still wanted to murder all of us and laid down a hard line that she would agree to nothing less that permanently banishing the mask to eternal solitary confinement in the empty voids of space beyond our session.vvVV I have devised an alternative plan that after consulting with several other people I belief is the most prudent course forwards. As Lyra clearly wants nothing to do with the mask and as putting the mask together with Nick has been shown to be riskyboth alternate Nick abusing the mask to murder people and the fact that this mask is emotionally traumatized from that experience not wanting to be with Nick hereI am one of the only people remaining who is familiar with the mask.vvVV However the risk still remains that there is an error somewhere in that story and that this mask actually is hostile. Even in the worstcase where the mask wishes to kill all of us by controlling the wearerwhich I will add is unlikely to even be the case because if the mask really wanted us all dead it could have easily accomplished that already by nowI have a crown I am wearing right now that protects me from mental influences.vvVV I acknowledge that what I am doing is risky there is no denying that. However I have precautions and contingency plans set up that should contain most of the fallout should something bad happen. The alternative Lyra insisted on is banishing a likely innocent being into space both turning a very powerful entity firmly against us when we have no guarantee we can keep it in space isolated from our session and when having it on our side could prove to be potentially very useful when significant battles come later.vvVV Lyra is strongly advocating for extreme measures to be taken that she has little evidence to support should happen outside of her personal experiences which given the series of events has been very strongly skewed. I reached out to several other members to get their opinion on what should be done as well as several NPCs my sprite and Zach from your session when he happened to message me in the middle of all of this.vvVV I realize my actions have consequences and that my initial thoughts on what to do may not either be the best or what others would like me to do. That is precisely why I have kept an open mind with all of this and have been proceeding with caution. Lyra simply refuses to acknowledge that any other possibility besides the mask is evil could be true despite the fact that many others disagree with her and that there is a fair amount of evidence I have collected in the contrary.vvVV I understand and acknowledge that her engagements with the mask resulted in her experiencing a great deal of pain and suffering but I do not think it prudent or respectful to charge forwards to rash dangerous and irreversible actions with those limited beliefs.vvVV Even now Lyra is convinced that it would be morally wrong to create a new world as a result of the game because we would inevitable be putting a new world of creatures through suffering and pain. I respectfully disagreed with her but fully acknowledged that my point of view may be skewed by the selection bias that is my lifes experiences.vvVV As a result I have been asking a great many people about their perspectives on this matter in an attempt to keep my mind open and to more fully understand the decision at hand. I would be entirely unsurprised if when I talk to Lyra about this and what I have found she still adamantly sticks to her belief that it is necessary to cripple or sabotage the session in a way that would prevent the creation of such a world.vvVV Again I understand why she believes what she does but I do not believe it fair for her to enforce her beliefs on what should be done when every single other person disagrees with her and there is evidence to support the contrary.vvVV I want to work together with her. I do not want her to feel isolated or that we are working against each other. I do not want to feel that. I do not want to turn people against her as she frequently has attempted to do to me. But I am finding it more and more difficult to proceed against her pessimism and stubbornness.vvVV Looking back I realize that was far more text than I ever wanted to dump on you. That was an egregious violation on my part of conversational etiquette I sincerely apologize. I tend to get easily carried away when discussing dilemmas.vv,RPGStuck,d1nf7bb,1,t5_37dmy

When you lived peace reigned true and all strife was a distance memory. Alas you were struck down in your prime by your two sons their jealousy of your power eventually overcoming their morals committing patricide in cold blood. What they did not expect however was that your soul would eventually reincarnate in a mortal body seeking revenge on their acts of injustice. Floating in the spirit world for millennia you eventually found a suitable host a newborn boy stillborn still cradled in his mothers arms his immense potential lost to the will of fate. Using your very essence as fuel you breathed life in the now hollow vessel reigniting its will to live restarting the engine of power slumbering within and seating yourself at the throne of its mind.

If they go psycho you calm them the hell down before they can go wreak havoc. Do not back down and use physical restraining force is necessary to stop them.  c If your moirail is havings feelings troubles and you notice get them to talk to you about it.
