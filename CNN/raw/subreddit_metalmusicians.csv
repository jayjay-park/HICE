700869,0,t3_225up2,throw in a saxophone solo.   I also agree with the idea of variation.  Take your riff and see what else you can make of it. I know that when I write a song I can usually make a couple more out of the same riff just by changing the key or timing or adding a few other notes.  And with repetition  doing things in evenodd patterns can denote certain feelings.  repeating things an even number denotes a sort of resolution where odd numbers denote instability.  ,metalmusicians,cgjxw8c,5,t5_2sb0l

4250685,0,t1_cs3q4w5,I really like Nattens Madrigal personally. I agree its difficult to listen to at parts but I really enjoy what is essentially just a straightforward black metal release. Its also nostalgic for me I suppose.When I do my stuff I usually try my best to get a decent sound with what I got occasionally experimenting with different mics and seeing what happens. I find drums usually are what I end up playing around with the most and I have some techniques that have proven to be really handy to getting good sounds in an otherwise untreated space without resorting to samples. Filsofem is an interesting album solely for the fact that it was recorded with extremely unconventional methods by a professional engineer. Mics behind the bass drum headset mics for vocals extremely high gain guitar through a speaker etc are all just untouchable in audio engineering circles and even more so in metal where everything is done with such sterility. I agree with what you and others are saying though. Most attempts at recording lofi fall short because its assumed that you dont need experience or a basic understanding of recording methods to work in those environments when the opposite is more true imo.,metalmusicians,cs4rltk,1,t5_2sb0l

So what I do might be stupid and noobie but I have learned a little bit.This is meI use a Rode NTA and its definitely not the best mic for growl vocals your setup is muuuuch better for them lol. Anyway since I did that track I listed Ive added another EQ to my chain which I find to be super helpful to cut out some of that overpowering brightness that the NTA has but I just started doing that a couple of days ago lol. Here is my FX chain. Deesser TRackS CS DeEsser EQ FabFilter solely to lower frequencies I dont like Compressor EZMix  Hard Metal Vocals which adds delay eq compression and tape drive EQ again to boost good frequenciesand on the vocal master track I use a ton of vocal tracks and theyre all children of this track DeEsser again mostly because my mic is so damn bright and those Ss are painful  Compressor to glue all the vocals together Delay Reverb Stereo Width I use this after delay and reverb because I felt like using it before slightly muddled thingsFor what reason are you using a noise gate? It may be unnecessary. Overdrive and distortion are generally no nos but its all up to whatever style you want to go for.,metalmusicians,d2b5mbp,2,t5_2sb0l
