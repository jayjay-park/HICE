Unless there is a Traffictype scandal or monumental financial screw up I dont think USL is going to rebel against the new MLS structure.NASL doesnt even seem financially possible with our current ownershipmanagement. This is not a knock at them. They are awesome. I just dont see them making the financial commitment. Thats serious cash for teams that dont make money.I have no idea whats best for CFC. I just think local attitudes and perspectives towards th tier soccer will change when Real Atlanta United FCSC begins play in  in a brand new facility with whatever star power Arthur Blank buys. ,ChattanoogaFC,csiyvjd,1,t5_36iog
10789412,0,t1_ddsn8mt,A legit concern. Im not sure if you are familiar with the story of the Rochester Rhinos but there is a lot to be learned from them. They were a team that should have landed in MLS around  or so. Their popularity was sky high but they didnt make the jump when they had momentum and it never materialized. They have floundered in the lower divisions of US Soccer ever since.,ChattanoogaFC,ddsunyr,2,t5_36iog
