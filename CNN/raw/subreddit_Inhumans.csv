8784223,0,t1_d73p1zz,Ive actually never seen passion. Black Bolt is buff in the comic for sure but I dont think its as important. Im sure if he were to take the part he would do some beefing up. Im a big fan of Black Bolt. Watching the first episode of Person of interest sold me on Jims ability to act though silence. ,Inhumans,d73p84w,1,t5_30g01
