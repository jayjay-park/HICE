1821255,0,t3_2fen5m,DudeMake the game you want to play.  Play it.  It is a great game and you deserve to take some time and play your creation.  It is a fantastic game.  A lot of the elements that you bring in are fantastic and brand new to the genre.  Quite a feat considering what other games are in this genre.I am having a blast playing it and I have played way more than a few incremental games. Thanks for making it for us.,crittermound,ck8ncji,1,t5_335kq
