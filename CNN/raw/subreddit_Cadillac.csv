162404,0,t1_cewj91n,ClassicallyTrained is absolutely right. I just asked my engineer and he gave me the same reply. It will adapt to your driving style but wont become a sportier car. Good news is we make an awesome tune for the ATS turbo. It adds a ton of power takes your stock ATS to HP and we did some impressive throttle and transmission tuning. Check it out! ,Cadillac,cewxibx,2,t5_2t4qi

3025896,0,t1_cobm6e3,I personally think the vogue tires look good on these cars but theyre pretty expensive so Ive had to hold off on getting any myself. As far as rim size the stock wheels are  inch and I usually see anywhere from that to  inch on local eldorados and sevilles but I havent gone larger myself because I dont want to sacrifice ride quality. The  inch wheels do look very nice on these cars though.,Cadillac,cobmqso,1,t5_2t4qi
3202488,0,t3_2wrv04,A couple years ago I performed Bluetooth VCIM Swap in my  CTS you might have seen my thread on the Cadillac Forums The process was easy for the Bluetooth swap however I dont think youll have much luck with the RemoteLink for a couple reasons. Since the Bluetooth interface is builtin to the hands free calling component of the VCIM the car is completely unaware if a call is made over OnStar or over Bluetooth. The car just sees it as a handsfree call and the VCIM handles the rest. This is why it was such an easy swap to gain Bluetooth functionality. The problem with the RemoteLink is that the VCIM has to communicate with multiple systems in the car in order for RemoteLink to operate. This includes the BCM ECM and other internal componentssystems. Since your car is an  your cars modules have no awareness of the RemoteLink functionality and therefore the RemoteLink feature will either fail or cause unexpected results with the car.. Bluetooth is selfcontained in the VCIM. It requires no activation or services with OnStar. Remotelink however is provisioned and utilizes the OnStar Service. OnStar is aware of the model years that RemoteLink is enabled on. Even if you install a VCIM with RemoteLink features Im almost certain OnStar will not activate it since they know that the  CTS does not contain RemoteLink functionality.Im sorry but I think youll just hit a brick wall metaphorically speaking. However Ill clarify the other part you were asking aboutWhen I installed the VCIM in my car the VCIM had to be both calibrated and associated.The VCIM calibration is done by the dealership. They use a Tech to perform the Onstar Setup Procedure. This calibrates the VCIM to recognize the components in your car for items like handsfree calling and remote door unlock.The other part is you need to get the VCIM associated with your vehicle. This is not done by your dealership but through Onstar. Onstar has the the ESNIMEI mobile ID of the VCIM paired with the VIN of the car it was installed in. If you do not reassociate the module OnStar does not know the module is in your car. It thinks its in the car the module was donated from. Your onstar account will be still associated with the VCIM module you removed.After I installed the module I contacted OnStar by pressing the blue button. I told them my Onstar module was changed and that the module needs to be associated with my car. I gave them my Cars VIN and they reassociated both my car and account to the module.So as mentioned I dont know if youll have much luck with the RemoteLink functionality but if you have any other questions let me know.,Cadillac,cotxr9n,2,t5_2t4qi

5794696,0,t3_3uikx5,nd SRX in the earlier years had some common problems to watch out for. Generally youll be safe with anything .. Although If youre coming from an Escalade both . and . even a .T will not cut it. It was difficult to make a switch from a V for me even when it almost matched performance of my old Vs. Theres still something thats not quite satisfactory if comparing to a V. was the first year of . and it became the only engine option for .  had only . and .T option. Door lockunlock switch had been moved to the doors from the center console. received CUE as well as a new style side marker new grille and lower bumper. New instrument panel. New shift knob new steering wheel. Basically an early facelift to accommodate CUE.Common problems would be leaking sunroof drain on the passenger side front. It pops out of position due to too short of a hose and it will go unnoticed until it soaks the entire passenger side carpeting once it rains.The chrome molding piece under the mirrors fall off randomly on earlier cars. It was enough of an issue to make the parts become backordered back in the days but now almost all dealerships have the part ready to go. And newer cars seemingly have better adhesive.The radio unit before CUE sometimes has trouble losing memorized entries such as radio favorites and clock nav settings etc. Sometimes can be fixed with reprogramming sometimes it needs replacement.Some earlier SRX AWD vehicles had problematic rear differential where it had inadequate sized filter seal causing pump failures. Service Rear Axle message on dash. There is a TSB on this.If I were to make the choice Id go with a  to get CUE and avoid some of those earlier year troubles. ,Cadillac,cxfdxq8,2,t5_2t4qi
5821434,0,t1_cxiph63,They dont hire mechanics to work at parts stores. Though it is a pressurized system so does not really matter where the crack is. The coolant will flow. Northstars really like the OEM fluids and nothing else. If you have a leak and you have lost coolant that it is the OEM and that it matches the color in the radiator currently. ,Cadillac,cxipr0z,1,t5_2t4qi

I guess thats irrelevant to you I just want lurkers to take note.If it ever helps in your purchase also include easy chip upgrades like this APR The Audi looks slow on paper but then you chip it for  less in spring when its always on sale and suddenly youre grinning constantly.As this is a Cadillac sub GO CADDY!

8315056,0,t3_4tftya,They lied. Good luck getting anywhere youll exhaust yourself long before they are of any help. Youre not the only one pissed about Cadillacs decision to screw everyone with pre CUE hardware. People on the Cadillac forums have resorted to paying  to buy upgraded hardware from third parties so they can update their systems to get the speed boost CarPlay etc. etc. offered in the newer systems.As of this moment that is the only way to bring an older CUEready Cadillac up to speed. Otherwise youre just wasting your breath trying to get Cadillac to help. They reneged on their promise and they made it clear. Also if you upgrade your hardware it cannot void your warranty. It is illegal and backed by law. MagnusonMoss Warranty Act of  The ATS is my third Cadillac but if Im forced to pay for an upgrade out of pocket that was promised by Cadillac to be free Tesla will be gaining a customer before I buy a fourth. ,Cadillac,d5gxsmu,2,t5_2t4qi
