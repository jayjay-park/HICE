3950071,0,t3_35kcc4,I remember reading about a particularly interesting species of moth. It is invasive iirc. The females are pure white and incredibly hard to scare away. This may be a female of that species although Ive forgotten the name.,moths,cr6jiu0,2,t5_2smr2

11196214,0,t1_df00x1o,Wow I just looked up that moth and it is truly incredible. So many colours.Its not so much a fear of them hurting me. I just find their shape and speed really frightening but Im mot too sure why.A couple of years ago I had a big fear of Crane Flys. I overcome it be just thinking fuck it! and I picked it up and took it outside. Once I pick up my first moth and put it outside I will begin to lose my fear. The problem is just getting over that first hurdle. When I see them I just run for my life. They fly in circles around lights and it just creeps me out. I come from the UK so we dont typically get  many moths anyway. Mostly silkmoths when we do. Thanks for your reply,moths,df12snm,1,t5_2smr2
