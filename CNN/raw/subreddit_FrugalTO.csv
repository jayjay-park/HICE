8797277,0,t1_d74vopu,You can price match the same things. So if its a whole chicken sold by price by weight the brand doesnt matter just that the item is comparable. Vegetables are great to price match as are fruits because they are generally sold by weight. I also find things like eggs dairy products and the odd packaged things like bacon. The flipp app is so handy for me. I pass every kind of store on my way home so popping in to grab a sale item is easy without costing gastravel time. But when I have points for items I always try to price match. Maybe it takes a little time once a week to make a game plan but twenty minutes tops. ,FrugalTO,d75b9lu,1,t5_2wwmp

9539498,0,t3_5bh1cg,Amazing deal. They keep the price down by having all their customer questions in their forums. Its on Telus and Bell towers so their LTE is trustworthy too. If anyone ends up signing up we can send each other a referral I havent signed up yet cause Im waiting on my SIM card.  But my friends have been on it for a week now and ditched Rogers. PM if you wanna mutually refer each other can only do it at sign up. ,FrugalTO,d9oxwp0,4,t5_2wwmp
