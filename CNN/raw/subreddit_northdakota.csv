The cut makes the grade easier on locomotives but is a nightmare when the snow drifts in. On a side note it looks like theres a steam plume in the background  probably a steampowered rotary plow which is the railroad equivilent of a snowblower.

2321196,0,t3_2lvmup,Wall ACs are common here. A lot of them were added on much after the house or apartment was built. My parents have a  bedroom house with a full sized basement and the wall ac upstairs is plenty strong enough to keep it cool so depending on the size of the unit you should be fine. North Dakota might not have the extended periods of heat but its pretty well a guarantee that there will be a week or two of extremely hot and humid weather weather that comes in june or september is anybodys guess.Unless you have a wd pickup get the parking garage access. Even if you do have a wd pickup Id still get the parking garage. You dont want to dig your car out of a snow drift in the middle of winter. Windshields frost over overnight quite frequently. You get used to it. Let your vehicle warm up and let the defrost take care of it most of the time. If youre in a hurry scrape it off. ,northdakota,clym3w6,2,t5_2r04w
2444585,0,t1_cmdttz4,Corrupt might be a stretch but what has he done on the regulation side to disprove the proposed bias...  He sides with the industry time and time again.  I do not know of a single time off hand where he has regulated against their interests. Questioning his corruption is our duty. If we dont who will.  True corruption is hard to prove and will be. If he was an old Merck employee now in charge of the FDA showing disregard for everything but the drug companies people would think the same.   His history in an already questionable industry with a proven disregard for the common good is enough for me.  Until his actions prove me wrong and I hope he does.Edit.  I do not intend to be argumentative.  I am just trying to elaborate my concerns of a man would be any man with a history such as his and his position.

Source.So if its not good enough for Bismarck why should it be good enough for Standing Rock?That said I know that transporting oil via a pipeline is safer than trucks or trains.  I dont know what the solution is but I support the protestors.

11232317,0,t3_60c549,Lived in north central ND my whole life . The winters can be very cold and you should have a wd vehicle to be prepared for driving in wintry conditions. Roads close during the winter if there is a big enough storm.Summers are nice. Mostly s and July can see even hotter temperatures during the state fair. Theres not much for trees or hills. Very flat very wide open spaces where I live. Beautiful during harvest with all of the crops blowing in the wind.Where I live housing is sparse and expensive. Its very hard to find affordable housing. Since oil is down and slowly rising there seems to be a few more jobs opening up but many applicants for each. Be sure to bring a strong skill set.Very republican. I know a few democrats but mostly everyone voted for Trump in my city.  We are strong patriots who support the nd amendment drill for oil and drive big trucks. Hope I was some help and feel free to ask any more questions.Edit Wanted to add that growing up here was amazing. There was low crime every teacher knew your name and had time to help and support you. The town raised the children. Great place to raise kids. Not much to do but its safe. There has been a rise in crime since oil came but it is nothing like a large city.Ive stayed simply because I wouldnt make what I make here anywhere else as a young man. Its where my family and farm is. Some people stay some people move far away from here. We stay mostly because its all we know. We can be somewhat sheltered by the big scary world living here. We dont have too large of populations. Dont see too much real homeless. Dont see harsh living conditions. Dont see drug addicts or mentally ill on the streets.
