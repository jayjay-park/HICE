11701814,0,t1_dglnfd0,Youre right but Im just sick of the fucker. ACHeat shit out on me. Radio doesnt work. Leaks oil and hydraulic fluid. The plexiglass windows on the sides and rear of the cab are sunburnt and you cant see shit out of it. Every hatch on the house is held down by bungee straps. Now the radiator literally exploded. The damn thing just needs to hurry up and die lol. ,heavyequipment,dgmf3uf,1,t5_2rbvb
