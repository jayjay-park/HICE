Like many other stories out there Im currently at  after having it off the charger for  hours. I went to the beach yesterday and played frisbee under the hot sun for an hour and showed off my watch to my buddies for a good amount of time. Granted it was idle for maybe  hours overnight I deliberately left it off the charger last night to see how much would drain overnight and how long I could use it the next day. Its still chugging along at  pm right now.This is a pretty solid watch so I dont think you have any worries. Hope that helps!!!,moto360,cksnyms,3,t5_30zwd

Those tasks would probably be considered extreme considering most people are trying to baby their device. I have insurance so I dont care if I crack my screen or break the back so I have the freedom to not worry. I doubt Motorola made my watch any differently than yours or infused mine with titanium or anything so the fact its holding up well when people with aftermarket accessories are breaking them left and right Id say those accessories are to blame.
