5261509,0,t3_3n24kp,Its such a weird ability and occasionally in a team fight Id see myself ulting someone not for the damage but because I feared my ssh and wanted to just make a big splash before I went. Honestly expected a gutting of the ult damage this isnt so bad,FioraMains,cvk7scv,1,t5_388x9
6187364,0,t3_3xlsw8,You go aggressive in lane most of the time unless youre against someone like Tahm Kench in which case you just roam. Try to proc their vitals as much as possible dont be afraid to use your w to try to hit a vital it can be good for poking in lane. You can turret dice quite easily due to grand challenge. Your q is your main escape tool however dont be afraid to parry a bola or something similar if a Rengar is coming to gank you it can save your life. Remember if you parry an immobilising disable they are stunned by your w. I havent yet managed to get the hang of teamfighting with Fiora no matter how much I play her. I suggest however going for the squishies since you absolutely destroy squishies. Shes good throughout the game and shes a great pusher. Use your e on towers for faster pushing. My build on Fiora is typically a Ravenous Hydra then if Im ahead Youmuus Ghostblade if Im doing ok Black Cleaver and then Mercurial Scimitar and situational could be either Dead Mans plate or Infinity Edge. Hope I helped ,FioraMains,cysxsm3,1,t5_388x9
6273214,0,t1_cz2oubh,Well if you consider gold efficiency of the runes  attack damage quints gives you  gold worth of stats while attack speed will give you . I dont know the DPS increase that attack speed gives you but with how much AD youre building . ad pales in comparison to  increase in attack speed as you build items.Also it makes your attack animation a little smoother and faster so you can cancel it a bit better.But it should also be considered that  AD quints plus  CDR Quint for an early  CDR is also a popular rune page. Try both out and see how you like them is what I would do. I find myself liking the attack speed personally.edit said attack speed quints twice,FioraMains,cz2ozc5,4,t5_388x9

I know its hard to be patient sometimes I like fighting all the time and when they play like this i tilt but just having cs lead wins you the game since you scale late game even harder. If your lane is pushed just go roam mid and by the time he pushes back you will get back and wont miss any cs ,FioraMains,d89sguo,1,t5_388x9
9319994,0,t1_d8wu0o4,Totally understand and if the Yas mains community sees that sorta of bullshit the player is ostracized. Bottom line there are just shitty people that play League and thats regardless of the champ they pick. I find it hilarious the amount of shit people will talk because theyre behind a keyboard but its nothing that a mute button cant fix.  I would argue though that both champs are equally difficult because of their insanely good mobility. I wouldnt be surprised if the champs shared some of the same coding too.You should honestly pick up Yas. Hes viable top and mid and youd probably enjoy his playstyle.  ,FioraMains,d8xdljd,1,t5_388x9
9341239,0,t1_d8xmp16,I indeed agree. You dont beat Pantheon in lane and all you are looking for is to survive. I too run a special page that has armor yellows blues and  armor quint. Combined with cloth   pot you are rocking  additional armor with enough sustain from pots. With the hp from the resolve tree masteries you are ready to survive the early game till lvl . lvl  opens an allin possibility as pantheons ult is not meant for v combat. The match up is all about trading your health for his mana. When Pantheon runs out of mana he cant spam his spears.You outscale pantheon hard so dont feel the urge to force anything as it might cost you the lane and even the game but dont hesitate to punish him when he makes a mistake. ,FioraMains,d902ii0,1,t5_388x9

9581099,0,t3_5c6loz,Hello DomasIm gonna address proccing ult fast first since its easier.If you are close enough there is a very easy method of procing all four vitals in quick succession. Ult them auto attack one vital then quickly move to an adjacent vital to quickly proc it with E since it resets auto attack timer then Q to the opposite direction of where the remaining two vitals are still standing which will proc one more vital then move to the last vital and proc it with the second E attack.This combo is useful if you are ambushing unwary enemies or to catch enemies off guard while they are chasing very close to you. The sudden burst of damage and healing will quickly turn a fight around or kill enemies very quickly. However this require a lot of practice to pull off since messing up an attack means you need to take extra time to readjust and that will allow the enemy to react appropriately and that can be fatal at times.Taken from my guide found here with exampleAs for splitpushing it is actually way more complex than simply pushing a lane . But the main goal for splitpushing is to apply pressure to side lanes so that the enemy team has to respond to you by either matching you or ganking you which allows your team to take down objectives such as dragons or towers.However if you simply AFK push  disregarding your teams positions then it is very easy for the enemy team to catch you off since your team may not be contesting anything. At this stage where your team is not grouped for anything you should not push too far in. One way to do this is to push a wave then disappear from the map to ward or do jungle etc then return to take another wave. Repeat this until your team pressures something then you will have your wards and the enemies position to help you decide whether to keep on pushing or not.Since TP takes . seconds now if the enemy team has high engagement tools such as Sivir then you should stay close to your team regardless since it will usually be too late when you arrive as the fight might have already ended or your team could have been at a disadvantage with one or two teammates caught. Otherwise even if you do not have TP you can still do splitpush but you should still try to stay within reinforcement range. For example you can splitpush top lane if your team is sieging mid tier two turret. But you should make sure that you pay attention to the map and respond as soon as possible by running to help your team.If your team is trying for Baron or Dragon it is always advised to join your team before the fight starts since while doing Baron or Dragon your team will be forced to stay next to it which means that without you your team will easily be forced to give away the objective or have to fight without room for retreat.If you have any other questions feel free to ask.Aegis EnGarde,FioraMains,d9u2e6o,3,t5_388x9

11237257,0,t3_60cpnh,In most situations your ult is your kill pressure with Fiora its on a fairly long cooldown so I wouldnt recommend using it just to get the other laner to back. That said if you can use it in a way that will say get you the tower or prepare a dive with your jungler thats a different story entirely!You can usually allin a top laner with your ult especially if you riposte their only CC. Ill often find myself ulting after a good riposte to force out summoners or get them out of lane if they dont have their teleport available.,FioraMains,df5q6xj,1,t5_388x9
11252984,0,t1_df7agu6,OKAY lets compare  vital smack of each  Lets say theres a tank with .k HP and  Armor.  ignoring MR cause no magic damage hereBork will do   on hit mitigated by armor to   physical damage from the passive of bork alone. Plus  from the actual AD of the item translates to  more physical damage on your auto after armor.   AD. Extra max hp true damage Extra damage. TOTAL BORK An extra  Damage on that tank.Bloodthirster gives you  AD which means you do  extra damage on auto.  and an extra . max hp true damage damage.TOTAL BLOODTHIRSTER An extra  Damage on that tank. So in short at that point Bork is alot better vs the tank atleast in a single smack of a vital... so no you are wrong BorkgtBT vs tanks also if you build Cleaver or LastWhisper realize Bork would only come out further ahead. ,FioraMains,df7ic40,2,t5_388x9

11380953,0,t1_dflyxpp,Uh not really that good  ranked games last season peaked at Gold  and tilted last few days of the season back to Gold . Ive played the matchup a ton before but then I started running into better Fioras just when I play the traditional way on Irelia I kinda dont see how I outdamage Fiora.So I tried a different strategy last night against one Fiora and instantly regretting it when she snowballed hard on my lane. Since Ive been having fun just going a Q max on Irelia and buying Tear early. It did not work out so brightly as other matchups which is definitely an error on my part.But even in a traditional lane if I hadnt went that route I feel useless because even before Ive struggled pretty badly against Fiora lanes.But my  is my match history so I guess you can analyze for yourself. ,FioraMains,dfm0fsz,1,t5_388x9

11569274,0,t3_653leu,I go corrupting for bleeding damage like Darius vlad and tanks that go corrupting like naut its really good for ignite as well plus it saves you money for potion and sometimes you can get mana hungry when you split push,FioraMains,dg7dsh1,1,t5_388x9
11570434,0,t1_dg76jhw,I mean youre not wrong but I feel thats more related to both Phage items giving  CDR for cheap...  I feel like if say Deaths Dance was given  CDR alot of fiora players would likely ditch phageCleaverTrinity... THE MS IS NICE and all but The quicker  CDR is nicer. If Cleaver lets say gets rebalanced to giving only say AD but say  Hp Id never buy it.  Id sooner go Iceborn gauntletSwiftness Boots or something. Or Deaths DanceLucidity boots.,FioraMains,dg7ij2j,1,t5_388x9
11659986,0,t1_dgg6bko,Basically. Other items offer better ad and lifesteal and the passive becomes useless after  items. Its decent against super kity comps but otherwise theres never a reason to get it.,FioraMains,dghoa4m,1,t5_388x9
