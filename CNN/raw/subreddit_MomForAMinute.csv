8910899,0,t1_d7iyaik,Having had this appointment myself more than once I wish I could be there for you. If it makes it easier have a plan. Even if that plan is just once simple sentence My anxiety and depression has been really bad lately and I am really nervous talking about it. If you can get just that much out just that much the doctor will be able to help you say the rest. Shell be able to ask you the important questions and help guide you through what kind of interventions might be best. If you come in with that once sentence just that sentence prepared....you will know that you have a plan. You are NOT the first person to say this to them. You probably wont be the first person that very day. Wanting someone to be there for you is not at all silly or strange. It is normal to want human comfort. But know that once you do this youll feel ten feet tall! And if nothing else Ill be so so proud of you. ,MomForAMinute,d7iykiq,3,t5_3g7sw
8914380,0,t1_d7ii6hq,Hun if it seems like therapy isnt working it may be that your therapist isnt a good fit for you. Sometimes just like taking medication it takes a few different ones before you find one that you click with. Sometimes you are lucky and the first one you try is awesome.Im proud of you. You are brave and strong and awesome.,MomForAMinute,d7jdm06,1,t5_3g7sw
8920246,0,t1_d7k298j,Thanks sis are you sure? I mean the bathroom is pretty disgusting albeit just dusty. I felt like I did good and then I looked around my apartment...  but this stuff had to be done now deadline is Thursday the bathroom can wait right? ,MomForAMinute,d7k301l,5,t5_3g7sw
8920479,0,t1_d7k3vqy,I hope so... Its been a horrible few months. Seeing the light at the end of the tunnel now I just hope its not oncoming traffic. And its not that disgusting... its just been a little over a week and looks icky. I took some time off work but I cant seem to get anything done just sleeping. Maybe I should make a schedule? ,MomForAMinute,d7k40az,3,t5_3g7sw

8944835,0,t1_d7myfsq,Kids arent for everyone and you shouldnt feel pressured into having any. You should make it a point to talk to Peter about it and see where he stands. I also dont think you should make an absolute decision just yet. Youre young and feelings may change. Fear of not unconditionally loving a child is normal. Being responsible for another human is a big fucking deal. Its not something to make a whimsical decision on. ,MomForAMinute,d7n1cnp,1,t5_3g7sw
8961095,0,t1_d7ox3t7,I have to agree. You cant fix him but you can as his friend support him on the path to fixing himself. And after he is coping and handling his depression much better then you can see about romance.,MomForAMinute,d7ozm1p,2,t5_3g7sw
8998505,0,t3_53iu73,Mom is a little busy at the moment you will have to put up with me for a bit!

9004020,0,t1_d7tus8h,Good for you!! Dishwashers are great because once you load them up they do the work for you.  My parents never used our dishwasher for reasons unknown to me and now that I have moved out my roommates and I use ours all the time and only hand wash the pots and pans and anything too delicate for the dishwasher. Youre a star and Im proud of you for getting up and doing even just this one chore. Its one less thing that youll need to do later! Youre accomplishing things even if it feels like youre not. Keep up the great work! And if you need to take a break or youre tired from the day thats okay too duckie. Tomorrow is always there to try again. ,MomForAMinute,d7u5635,2,t5_3g7sw

9140252,0,t3_55heer,Honey youre not cursed. I promise you. Were all statistical anomalies in our own ways and everyone experiences their own unique tragedy.I am so so sorry that this is happening to you. Please dont feel responsible for any of it because you arent. Nicks reaction in this situation is entirely unwarranted and unacceptable and you cant let him keep harassing you. Block him on Facebook block his number on your phone and ask mutual friends to respect your privacy and not pass him any information he might ask them about you.The only monster in this situation is Nick. ,MomForAMinute,d8alcvh,6,t5_3g7sw
9240524,0,t3_56xkaa,Hey mate. Im so proud of you for getting good grades. Your hard work now is such an important part of your growth as a person and even though its hard to see how grades translate into real life youre learning to focus and to work through difficulties now and thats really important for adulthood.While you might not get grades as such in the workforce youll have projects and goals and timeframes and Im confident that youll be able to make them because youre doing so well now.Im sorry your friends dont appreciate how hard youre working and I know what you mean about teenagers being difficult to handle. But please dont be afraid to reach out to them know that theyre under the same kind of pressure as you and that everyone you meet has something they can teach you.I hope you can talk to a school counsellor about how youre feeling because youre a good kid and like everyone else youre a valuable and worthy human being and you deserve to know that. You are so much more than your grades. You dont need to be perfect and I hope you get to a place where you dont feel the need to be perfect to prove that youre good.I hope this helps. Love you.Mom,MomForAMinute,d8naxsw,5,t5_3g7sw

11217717,0,t3_6052a2,I havent had anything like that except childbirth and my epidural I guess. But I always psych myself out before any procedure and panic. Usually its not as bad I think itll be and I just scare myself unnecessarily. I dont know if youre the same. But I truly think you will be ok Ill be thinking of you.  ,MomForAMinute,df3ij75,3,t5_3g7sw
11306711,0,t3_61cigo,Honey I know it is impossible to see right now but someday you will see the end of this relationship in a different light. It will be extremely difficult deal with it for a while but you are strong and will be stronger for it. You deserve better and it will come in time. But first you must give yourself the treatment and respect you deserve. You must learn to love know nurture and be loyal to yourself. Its a process. Start with being good to and nurturing yourself. Make a list of things that make you feel good and start doing them. Love yourself. You are definitely worth it.,MomForAMinute,dfdlk8j,6,t5_3g7sw
11614880,0,t3_65qsau,You are not unlovable bunny. Boys are just very stupid sometimes. I know its told many times but Ill say it again. The right man will come to you.
