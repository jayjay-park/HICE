1397344,0,t3_2a2sc8,Not too far from Le Dossen you can go to  St Pol de Lon cathedral Roscoff lle de Batz BrignogantPlage and the coast  around Morlaix and the Morlaix bay Carantec PrimelTregastel coast.If you go inland dont miss the little mountains Les Monts dArr and Huelgoat a beatiful chaos of rocks. Thats about km from Le Dossen. Maybe the Guerledan lake too. There is a lot of beatiful places in center Bretagne.The Lanleff Temple is an unrecognized place but might been seen in my opinion. Magical at the sunset ! If you like church I recommend you Quimper cathedral.Theres to many things to say about Bretagne. I always lived here and I love it.Sorry for my crappy english Im at work on my phone. Not ideal for long text ! ,Bretagne,cirfrww,2,t5_2s9q8
