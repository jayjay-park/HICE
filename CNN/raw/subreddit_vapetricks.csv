6456174,0,t3_442j19,I do a very short lung inhale. When I drop the nd puff I tend to use my tongue and cheek to push out the puff rather than blow it out. My setup also creates a lot of vape so a mouth inhale would work too but I prefer a short lung inhale.,vapetricks,czn40kz,5,t5_2y665

6759896,0,t3_48bi9x,I got the same problem until someone here on reddit told me i shouldt be waiting for the perfect o.I was always checking my os when they came out then they had traveled cm already or so. then i tried to do the bending.Now i just push the o immediatly sometimes the o doesnt even look like an o yet but when you start bending it becomes an O.For me this helped very much maybe you should try this too.,vapetricks,d0ij324,3,t5_2y665

10415174,0,t1_dcohuz0,All I have really figured out there is to either close my mouth at the end of the inhale or like in this video I cut it off with my tongue.  Speed and amount I am still playing with.  Thus not having it on lock.,vapetricks,dcomm72,1,t5_2y665
