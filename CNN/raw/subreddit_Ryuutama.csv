4915695,0,t1_cue3kxn,I feel like asking a GM to talk about their characters is like asking a soccer mom to talk about her kids. D Ill have to update these as I dont have access to their histories they havent uploaded them to our shared drive yet but we have the following  Eirene Adwagaband  NobleMagic  The young daughter of a duke or was it baron? who is on a journey to study and understand magic. Is absolutely terrified of combatblood. Everyone constantly forgets her obnoxiously complex last name and its already a running joke that everyone has their own spelling for it. I genuinely have no idea what it really is. Shes our teams mapper since her player actually loves to make maps IRL and has a talent for it. Fracas  MinstrelTech  A jester who plays the hurdy gurdy and travels with Eirene his patron and his pet goat Thistleweed. Does his best to make the world know what a brave warrior Eirene is... even though shed rather he not. Teams journalist and writer.Yettobenamed  MinstrelMagic  A talented flautist and entertainer who uses his music to weave magic. I cant recall most of his background but hes fairly young. Joined up with Eirene because of the legends of her amazing swordsmanship though comes to quickly realize that shes rather helpless. His player is new to roleplaying as well which is exciting. Turnip Stew  FarmerFighter  Gentle and friendly is journeying to make his fortune so that he can pay to have his parents released from jail as they were unable to pay their taxes to Eirenes family no less. Has secondary skills in hunting.Ashe  HealerTech  Determined to be the best healer she can be... and may also have an uncomfortable interest in learning how to raise the dead. Corbin  ArtisanFighter  A large imposing yet goodhearted blacksmith travelling the world with his trusty buffalo Tromper. Teams quartermaster and bumbling beefcake. Village burned down while he was listening to a strange wandering flautist the same one from above. ,Ryuutama,cue5szb,5,t5_2zqlh
8623419,0,t1_d6jcnsk,Couldnt say it much better.I will add that I think the mechanics of Ryuutama are uniquely suited to telling those fun feel good journeys that Ryuutama promises on the box so to speak. You could play a similar game in Fate but youd be missing some things I think. But thats just like my opinion man. ,Ryuutama,d6jj244,3,t5_2zqlh
