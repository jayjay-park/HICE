155287,0,t1_cew2kqd,Im not going to write an entire essay back but theres a lot of holes in your reasoning here.Theres totally room for error. Thats how you learn. It seems like you think people who start out are inherently ignorant and reckless but thats not the case. When you start driving a car you dont speed everywhere. You take it slow just as someone learning to ride in the city would.Massachusetts has a specific statute that says cyclists can pass cars on the right so the truck was still in the wrong even if the cyclist was negligent. You cant blame him for believing that traffic should yield to him as they are lawfully required to do.If youre excessively cautious of EVERY possible danger as you suggest thats when you get into accidents. When youre too busy looking to your right to avoid getting doored you might not notice another cyclist passing on your left. When youre too busy checking behind you to make sure cars dont come too close to you youll miss the car stopped short ahead.Theres a level of trust and faith that you need to have when youre on a roadway in a car or on a bike. If you believe everythings going to go wrong then it probably will. You learn that trust by actually riding not observing. responsibility? How am I supposed to know the car without a blinker next to me is going to turn right into me? How am I supposed to  know a pedestrian is going to walk between SUVs into the bike lane?In your once logic no one should jaywalk because one person getting killed because they didnt look should be enough reasoning for people to wait  seconds at an empty road for a cross signal.Listen I appreciate the essay but you clearly do not ride a bike and it sounds like you think that no one should ride a bike in the city unless they have urban riding experience which is completely illogical and backwards. Your opinions do not matter as much as those of those who are actually riding bikes with traffic because you are a reader and an observer not a participant who actually knows what its like to ride a bike in Boston.,boston,cew4ac6,1,t5_2qh3r

260166,0,t3_1x17sr,A Brokers Fee is whats paid to the rdparty service that a property owner is using to help find renters. This rdparty service will post on Craigslist meet with prospective renters do background checks paperwork and other things that the property owner may not have the time andor energy to do themselves. However this means that the rdparty service needs to be PAID for their work. Most of the time its equivalent to whatever  months rent would be in that particular apartment. Youll basically come across three different types in apartment listings. No Brokers Fee. This means that either the owner has agreed to pay the full brokers fee to the rdparty service or the owners doing all the advertising meeting with renters paperwork etc themselves.. Brokers Fee. This means that the owner is using a rdparty service to help them find renters but youll be responsible for paying the rdparty for their services.. Half Fee. This means that you and the owner will be splitting the cost of the rdparty service.Usually you want to go with either No Fee or Half Fee since this fee is nonrefundable. However SOMEtimes its worth paying the fee because a rdparty service can you show apartments that arent listed anywhere else and you might find a diamond in the rough.Long story short Brokers Fee means youll be paying an ADDITIONAL nonrefundable  months rent if you choose to rent that apartment. ,boston,cf7q46n,2,t5_2qh3r

294891,0,t3_1xflan,Some tips from a fellow Aussie expat who moved to Boston over a year ago from Brissie although I grew up in Perth. I am not in IT so cant comment on the job situation and I moved over by myself so I live near the subway lines to get into work downtown easily. Cars are cheaper to buy then in Australia but insurance is ridiculously expensive I was initially quoted k a year. Go to the department of roads and transport before you leave Perth and get a copy of your driving history as this may decrease your insurance premiums I was still told that with  years of experience with no incidents it would be around .k a year.  As an Australian you will need to resit the driving tests in MA if you plan to stay over a year or buy a car I presume. You can drive for a year on an international driving permit avail from any RAC branch. The tests involve sitting the written test everything was in miles and feet so it was a pain but you should pass first time with a little reading up then you need to sit the practical. There are some weird rules involved like you need a sponsor who has to be in the car with you as you take the test and they need to have had their MA license for a year to be a sponsor. I just went through a driving school.  The drivers here are pretty crazy  much crazier then anywhere in Australia I have ever been and I spent a lot of time in Sydney where they are pretty bad. This may be a bit better in the suburbs but I tend to spend a lot of time in the city because I work there. I dont know how much more I can help you but feel free to PM me if you have any other questions on things like health insurance etc. Good luck with the move! ,boston,cfbbxix,7,t5_2qh3r

It was obvious that the first few years had a large fanbase that liked the team itself and wanted it to grow.  When it was obvious the team wasnt growing at the same level as other teams they stopped caring.gtI like soccer. I watch other professional leagues from time to time. I dont enjoy the MLS product. Maybe that is the prevailing problem with developing a better fanbase? Im not entirely sure about that.  There are tons of people who are big fans of minor league teams or even nonleague teams.gtThey need to figure out how to get people like me to care about the RevsMLS.Honestly I dont think that will happen.  People who want EPL level playing simply wont get it with the MLS.gtKC Portland Seattle dont have  professional sports teams competing for the fans dollar. Boston has  historically important franchises and a dominating football team that has gone to  Superbowls in  years. The Revs just dont really move the meter at all.I think the appraoch is all wrong.  If you treat it like its on the same level as football or hockey it simply wont work.  If you treat as more of a minor league style league I think things will work out.  Hence the smaller stylized stadiums being more successful.  If you give people a sense of community while fostering relationships with fans you will build real fans out of people looking for something to be real fans of.  THEN casuals will catch on and want to be a part of the fanbase.,boston,cgbmt97,3,t5_2qh3r

Id suggest just figure out what you want to do and checking websites to see what things seasons are. My wife and I went out in November and stayed in Ptown. We drove out via Hyannis and did the Kennedy Museum Cape Cod Baseball League Hall of Fame Cape Cod Brewery and ate lunch. We came back via Woods Hole to see the Oceanographic Institute and also eat. While we were in Ptown we mostly walked around drank and ate the Mews Lobster Pot Squeeling Pig and Gov Bradford were still open. We also drove down to the big visitors center for the National Seashore in Eastham to do some hiking and ate Gilded Lobster Rolls at the Lunch Box since the Ptown location was closed. ,boston,cgcizrp,8,t5_2qh3r

And then I decided that maybe I should read the entire post before I press save. So I did. And I deleted my reply because the story seemed more dark gray than midgray.But were still in a gray zone.To call this a rape is like when I see these poor saps on rparenting saying their  year old was bullied at daycare.  yearolds dont bully. And this is not rape.Its not nice. Its not something the boy should be proud of. But its not rape.Lets imagine a story.Last night my buddy stopped by my house. He really wanted me to come out with him. I really didnt feel like it. My few nice shirts were in the laundry. I hadnt shaved or taken a shower. There was a good show on tv. And I kind of had to get up early.Come on Mambouli. Theres this girl I know wholl be at Bar Name X with her friends. She invited me and I really need my wingman right now I just cant go solo. You know youll thank me for dragging your sorry ass out the house.I refused some more. He insisted some more. And I said ok.Turns out I had a great night or not doesnt even matter.Was my buddy a dangerous predator? Afterall he did pressure me into doing something I was reluctant to do. If we swap going out with rubbing our privates together does it really change the nature of the interaction?gtwhen I stumbled into his dorm room after too many drinks. I mean were not exactly dealing with a predator here. This is not a make you drink too much and brings you to an isolated room upstairs kind of story.This is not a case of Dont dress sexy if you dont want to get raped. But stumbling into guys room at am when youre tipsy is probably not the best plan...  Because the vast majority of girls who stumble into a guys room at am are specifically looking for sexual encounter.Now Im not saying this gives him the right to do whatever he wants. But I understand it can lead to a serious mismatch of expectations.Girls who dont want sex tend to stumble into their own bedroom when theyre tipsy at am.gtAre you only going to make me hard or are you going to make me come?Im not going to make you come sorry for the misunderstanding.

683431,0,t1_cggwrry,I think part of the reasoning is that it can be empowering to the victim to have different levels of response available to them. Going to the police can seem like and often is an extremely trying process and the consequences for the perpetrator who is frequently an acquaintance of the victim are severe if found guilty. In that situation one might prefer to handle the situation and punishment within the confines of the school where A the burden of proof is likely lower requiring less scrutiny for the victim and B the perpetrator can be shown the error of their ways without ruining their life a pro if the victim still has some  positive sentiment for this person.I always thought of it like the American military in the cold war. Sure the big nuclear arsenal is impressive but if thats your only response you end up letting things slide if theyre bad but dont necessarily warrant WWIII. Sometimes its better to have a more focused solution on hand. That in theory is what the schools tribunalAd Boarddisciplinary councilwhatever provides.All of this is contingent on the school actually acting in a case like this which appears to not have happened. ,boston,cghygx9,1,t5_2qh3r

739917,0,t1_cgo8qix,This type of response is sadly all too common of a shared worldview.  Simply put its too simplistic.  When I first began commuting to Boston from Gloucester nearly eight years ago the cost of the commuter rail was much less.Even with my wife working and us living in a inexpensive second floor apartment we still struggled to make ends meet.  It got to the point where I ended up liberating toilet paper from my office building to help alleviate our grocery budget.  We thankfully were able to move in with my parents for a year which greatly reduced our expenses and allowed us to save up for a condo.Ive gotten off the mark here my point is that not all jobs are going to be willing to cough up a nice enough raise to cover the additional expense of commuting.

843647,0,t3_23qgl4,Ive lived there for years and I think most of the comments in here are accurate.  The bad  Its not that great for young single professional somethings because the nightlife is more family and townie focused. Youd have a lot more fun and people like you in Somerville or Cambridge. It is really good if you are a young family or looking to buy a house or if you are young and dont happen to like the bar scene.  I would be surprised to see that QC had more criminal activity that Somerville Cambridge or Boston. QC is definitely gross in some areas  right at the T stop and around the City Hall across the street from a shelter. I can remember a few violent attacks there over the years but I dont think any of them were random just fights between scumbags. Ive never been harassed or badgered by homeless like I am in Central Square.  There really arent any good bars other than Fat Cat and that place gets packed.  The Redevelopment Project is on hold despite what the City says and Mayor Koch clearly fucked that one up. I wouldnt hold out much hope for a bunch of fancy new buildings and a plan to kick the bums farther out to the dirtier burbs.  For the good  Its cheaper than most all other communities that sit on the MBTA lines. I pay less for a mortgage on a house than anyone does for an apartment in CambridgeSomerville. The people I know renting also pay less.  QC has great access to the commuter rail MBTA   and  if you are a commuter. Boston is the only other place where you can have access to as many routes and public transport. The T is not as bad as people say it is here. I commute during rush hour every day and the usual delay between trains is lt minutes. There are obviously more problems in the winter as there are everywhere on the T but I usually only have one terrible commute per month which is not bad compared to sitting in  traffic every day.  Its easy to get to Wollaston you could just live in Wollaston but there are less places to walk to which is a pretty good beach. The water isnt always safe but most of the season its fine. The beach sand isnt as nice as a lot of places. However you can park for free right next to the beach which is unheard of anywhere else. The view of Boston is nice. Its mostly families and old fat shirtless Quincy guys who smell like oil and listen to classic rock. There is a nice playground the sidewalk is in good shape and theres fried seafood ice cream a bar and dunkin donuts right across the street. If you dont like Wollaston get on  or a and head farther down the South Shore.  The food is good and reasonably priced and only lacks Mexican youd have to go to La Paloma in Wolly because Acapulcos is AWFUL. You can walk to indian shera punjab american bar food fat cat the fours bagels gunthers pizza schoolhouse thai little duck korean falafel king japanese fuji italian alba and dirty chinese. I honestly would rather eat breakfast at Gunthers and lunchdinner at Shera Punjab than eat anywhere else in BostonCambridgeSomerville.  If were sticking with QC the Stop n Shop is walkable with Rite Aid plus liquor amp beer next door.  Push it a little farther and youve got BJs Home Depot and Lowes within one T stop Quincy Adams.  Schools are good. Not the best obviously but were in MA and the standard is higher. Theres a new high school and a brand new middle school as well as preK programs.  Its gentrifying. The housing market in QC is getting insane houses are barely on the market a week before they sell. Its mostly young families moving in and old Quincy is either moving out or dying off or in the case of the flood plain getting priced out because of another Koch fuck up.  tldr QC has a lot of great things available but the nightlife still belongs to the townies. ,boston,ch06chz,5,t5_2qh3r

A driver had a seizure in Quincy less than  months ago. The only reason that bus didnt crash was because a passenger was able to get around the guy and put his foot on the brake where he kept it until EMTs arrived.I have to wonder too. Whats a reasonable number for assaults? Because less than  per week in a fleet of hundreds of drivers for a system that is so frustratingly amp painfully uncoordinated doesnt sound like the worst thing in the world. I have to wonder  if they put the money they are sinking into adding these to new buses you can bet its at least a few grand extra per bus was put towards efforts to improve timely service would those assault numbers go down?

Teslas being given about the same subsidy as installing a wind turbine or solar panels on your home at this point and thats no coincidence its part of a userlevel subsidy of nonpetroleumbased energy technologies aimed at slightly reducing but greatly seeming to reduce Americas contributions to rising CO levels. The plus side is that as the technologies improve with time and they do and faster with subsidies theyll actually start having a marked effect on emissions.

1243310,0,t3_28bzno,Hi.Ive done bicycle camping at the MV Family Campground a private campground that rents tenttrailer sites.  I was there with a bicycle touring group.  The campground is about . miles from the Vineyard Haven ferry terminal even further from the Oak Bluffs docks and is near the top of a hill.  It being one of the few campgrounds on island expect busy conditions.  I remember a problem with skunks foraging for food left by other campers also summer is prime dogdeer tick season on the Cape amp Islands.  The campground is well away from downtown Vineyard haven so for bicycle camping you have to plan ahead to haul in your groceries as well as your camping gear.Unsure how the MAMV Steamship Authority treats bicycle cargo trailers we used panniers on our camping expedition. It might be best to call the ferry lines and ask about specifics ahead of time.Slightly off subject if you are doing youth group camping Boy ScoutsGirl Scouts you can camp on land owned by the Trustees of Reservations owners of open lands in nantucket.  There are no public or private campgrounds on Nantucket.Good Luck,boston,ci9hkyy,2,t5_2qh3r

1298128,0,t1_ciffdf9,I dont have time to touch on all of your points but a couple of them stood out to me. First I agree on the dress code thing its unequal and maybe it should be adjusted to be more reasonable for guys and more restrictive for the girls. They do need something though because if they dont then too many of them will be way too messy. Second I completely agree on the gender inequality. I was automatically hired as a bagger because Im a guy. Girls are automatically cashiers. Guys have to bust their butts collecting carts and the girls never do. Guys have to clean up the spills girls never do. Guys have to wear a shirt and tie girls got away with pretty much anything. Thankfully I worked hard and got promoted very fast. Third I still dont understand why they have no website whatsoever. Even a basic one like you said would be better than nothing. Of course this company has been behind the times on technology forever. Their registers when I was there were the ones that other places got rid of. We didnt upgrade until YK and that was because they might not work after that if they didnt. We couldnt scan coupons. We had carbonless slips for debit transactions. The ordering system was literally pen and paper. There were zero security cameras. We didnt take credit cards at all. Their computer system for inventory and ordering was old WYSE terminals. Inventory for incoming product was to take all the slips and put them into an envelope after signing them. Now at least their stores are getting much better. They are modernizing and renovating and building new nicer stores. They still have a way to go though. They have security cameras although even the new ones are pretty old technology. All that being said I still do  of my shopping there. I like it and I hope it doesnt change for the bad. They need to make some basic improvements like the web site and be more reasonable with gender equality dress code and job assignments. These things dont cost a lot and dont have to mean higher prices. ,boston,cifnmua,1,t5_2qh3r

This is one of the most incredible statements Ive ever heard. How is it insane to get a hotel room or storage locker? These things exist as services everywhere so I assume same people utilize their services.I am a landlord and I can tell you a couple of things I will absolutely let a tenant move in early or move out late if there is no overlap but unless you are a close personal friend I am likely to demand that you pay a prorated rate for the time if its more than one night. Second starting midnight on  that room no longer belongs to the old tenant. A new tenant arriving on the morning of  and finding you in his room is the exact same as that tenant coming home a month later to find you in there. Lastly if you move out the same day they move in how am I supposed to have the apartment cleaned? Or repair things like paint or floors? How about doing my security deposit inspection?

Its the same way when a car pulls onto a loop that square box cut into the pavement or into the view of a camera. The detector gives the controller a call that a car is there and wants to proceed. Each phase is programmed into the cycle in order. So if a call is sent to the controller you have to wait for all of the other phases to go through before you receive your phase though sometimes this works a little differently based on different types of signals.Pushing the button wont give you an instant ped phase and neither will mashing the button multiple times. If you push a button and it doesnt call up a ped phase the button is probably broken. Call your DPW and have them go out and fix it. DPW guys dont spend their time going from intersection to intersection to make sure everything is working correctly. So if something looks unusual give them a call.,boston,cjuogcz,1,t5_2qh3r

1801915,0,t3_2f64vl,Disclaimer IANAL this is based only off a few years of reading through the various laws and guides. Also plugging rbostontenantsgt Is there a particular tenanthousing law broken by the property managers by allowing someone to store their stuff in our vacant apartment without our consent?They granted access to another person not on the lease and let them use it without your permission not even remotely kosher.When youre leasing the property is legally yours to use and control not anyone elses. You can call the police and report the trespassing. No idea if theyd do anything after the fact but I guess it doesnt hurt to ask. The property owner is only allowed to be there for emergency repairs and they have to give you  hours notice for any other reasons to enter the property. In the last month of the lease theyre allowed to inspect for damage for the purposes of determining what to withhold from your security deposit and show the apartment for rerenting so yes showing the unit was legal. Cmon.gtThe realtor is claiming that by default it expires at noon so its okay that someone moved in at pm.Unless the lease says otherwise its yours the full day of the first day listed on the lease until the full day listed on the end of the lease many leases specify times in addition to dates. Technically you were responsible for anything that happened to the unit or anything that happened to someone in the unit ie tripping and breaking their face so you should never agree to allow another party to move in when your lease is still in effect.BTW always communicate what youre doing with the unit. If you move mostly out a month before your lease the LL might come in see all your stuff gone and think youve abandoned the unit which I believe allows them to basically take it back over which is the excuse they might use here? So make it clear in writing  letter or email  what youre doing...,boston,ck6a9ie,6,t5_2qh3r

But Ill try again because I have plenty of fake internet points to lose and plenty more links  for example the New York Times and the Washington Post both had articles recently discussing the fact that this is not a clear cut issue and that researcher doctors policy makers and various bicycle groups continue to disagree on what is best.Edit  here is what wikipedia has to say in its first paragraph on bike helmets  There is ongoing scientific research into the degree of protection offered by bicycle helmets in the event of an accident and on the effects of helmet wearing on cyclist and motor vehicle driver behaviour. There is active debate over what can be concluded from available studies and on whether the use of helmets by cyclists should be promoted or mandated either just for children or for cyclists of all ages. In particular the debate over bicycle helmet laws is intense and occasionally bitter often based not only on differing interpretations of the scientific and other academic literature but also on differing assumptions and interests of various parties.Q ,boston,ck8n2a5,20,t5_2qh3r

Cyclists are a minority outgroup and face all the classic factors that result. It doesnt matter how lawabiding you are when the ingroup hates you and will leap on anything negative and blow it far out of proportion.Its an impossible standard there will always be people who break the law and a double standard drivers are not required collectively to perfectly follow the law in order to receive fair protection from police fair consideration after a crash the right to use the road and to have crimes against them addressed by the criminal justice system. In both cases its used to derail and distract from issues that affect us by changing the topic it also tries to force us to waste our time addressing nonsense arguments.Hey people keep dooring us. Yeah well cyclists need to follow the laws!We keep getting killed by truck drivers. Yeah well cyclists run red lights! none of the people killed by trucks were running red lights...No sober driver has been prosecuted for killing a cyclist in recent years. Cyclists need to follow the law.A cyclist was killed a the intersection of south and main. I bet he was running a red light.Wed like to put a bike lane in here which is proven to reduce injuries for all road users. When are you all going to stop running red lights and follow the laws?This is a bill for creating a  foot passing law to reduce deaths and serious injuries from cyclists being sideswiped. None of you follow the law why should we do this for you?This is a bill to criminalize harassment of cyclists and pedestrians on the road. Well maybe if you all started following the law you wouldnt get harassed.Decades ago feminists were attacked as homewrecking manhating communists.

It was just part of life like air and water. There never was an untoward incident. I let my yearold female cousin take my yearold daughter to the sand pile to shoot caliber rifles just the two of them without a worry or second thought. I knew my cousin had been trained properly and I knew she was quite the stable young woman. Those guns put a lot of food on the table. It seems strange to hear from someone so allergic to the idea. For example anyone can drive a car into a crowded sidewalk and take out more people than are killed in the average gun incident. Ill bet you arent saying youll not have friends who drive though.

2172228,0,t1_clesdlg,Heres a rundown to get you by New England Patriots American Football team in the NFL National Football League. Headquartersstadium is in Foxboro MA about  minutes south of Boston called Gillette Stadium yes named after the shavingrazors brand. Logo is a colonialera tricorner hat Patriot. Their quarterbackstar is Tom Brady hes also one of the team captains. Although theyre based in the Boston area the Patriots represent all of the New England states Connecticut New Hampshire Maine Massachusetts Vermont and Rhode Island. Some people in parts of New York the state not the city will also be vehement Patriots fans due to their proximity to New England and distance from NYC. Boston Bruins Ice hockey team. They play at the TD Garden in downtown Boston but most people will just call it The Garden they used to play in an arena called Boston Garden but that was demolished in . Their logo is a black puck with a yellow B in the middle with yellow spokes sticking out. They were Stanley Cup champions for the  season and theyve made it to either the semifinals or finals every year since. If you go to one of their games bring a light jacket it can get cold in there. Oh and their mascot is a bruin which is a type of bear although youll rarely see any bearrelated imagery in their promotional materials its usually just the stylized B puck. Boston Celtics. Basketball team in the NBA National Basketball Association. You might know about one of their most famous players Larry Bird. They also had Shaquille ONeal for a year or two but he left in . They ALSO play at TD Garden the basketball floor is removable for hockey games. Their biggest rivalry is with the Los Angeles Lakers. Logo is a Leprechaunlooking fellow spinning a basketball smoking a pipe and leaning on a shillelagh. Colors are white and green. Boston Red Sox. Baseball team in MLB Major League Baseball. Fierce longtime rivals with the New York Yankees. We were the underdogs for a long long time but we started winning the World Series again back in . They play at Fenway Park in Boston. Its a tradition during the th inning stretch a short break where everyone gets a chance to stretch their legs a bit or hit the bathroom to playsing Neil Diamonds Sweet Caroline. No one will think less of you if you choose to not participate in this relatively recent tradition. The city seems to be split  between I love this its fun! Loosen up a bit! to This is annoying as hell and Neil Diamonds not even FROM Boston hes from New York why are we doing this at a Red Sox game?! Part of Fenway Park is a large green wall called The Green Monster. Logo is a red sock ! but the runningaroundinasuit mascot is furry green monster named Wally get it? Monster? Wall?. The chants in the park will vary between GO SOX! and YANKEES SUCK! New England Revolution American Soccer or Football as you say across the pond. They share Gillette Stadium with the Patriots. They dont have nearly the same number of fans as the Pats or Bruins or Celtics but for American Soccer teams theyre not half bad.  Boston College Eagles College American Football team EDIT and basketball and other college sports but footballs the big one. If you see a Go Eagles! or BC shirtbanner using maroon and gold colors thats what its for.There are other teams Boston University Terriers Harvard Crimson etc but they wont come up as often in casual conversation unless youre actually AT Boston University or Harvard. Hope that helps!,boston,clfxwv5,3,t5_2qh3r

You can be extremely proactive and theyll still find a way they can squeeze through impossibly small holes. Certainly set traps orif there are no small children or pets in your buildingput out poison but I wouldnt stress too much until you start noticing things regularly.Also it may legally be your landlords responsibility but youll do a much better job taking care of the issue than they will as a rodent problem is an ongoing problem. Talk to your landlord and keep track of expenses but certainly work with them as full reliance will likelyunfortunatelynot result in the issue being taken care of as it requires a good amount of followthrough.Lastly might be worth checking cabinets  pantries.

Theyre just a few more overpriced condos for rich people. At least if you keep empty green lots you break up the monotony on the streetscape and allow the pedestrian to imagine something interesting being built there some day. The kind of Nimbyism I find frustrating is with the bigger complexes that would dramatically increase the citys housing supply but are forced to build with significant reductions in the number of units. The old boys and girls club at Washington and Boston St is an ideal example. They had to lop it from  to  stories sacrificing some affordable units so private residents on Monroe St didnt lose a part of their view.

But in this case I think it makes sense to convert some angle spots into a smaller number of parallel spots to make room for the row of trees that was supposed to be in the strip between the carriage and main roads.  Are there new trees now?As far as Herb Chambers taking over the public street by getting the city to add a minute loading restriction well it looks like the dealership was making use of the public parking spaces even before this.

And lets be serious  of people arent going to waste the effort of digging out someone elses car just to park.  Even if it is just the front end of rear end most people are just going to park where it is clearshovelledplowed etc.  This decreases the amount of available space on the road to everyones detriment.

3077784,0,t3_2veyvw,Step  If you arent confident driving in the snow you NEED snow tires. Even if you are confident driving in the snow you should have snow tires.Step  Calm down. Do not make abrupt inputs to anything  steering gas or brake. More throttle doesnt solve anything and will usually just make the situation worse. If you are nervous you are going to run into problems. Dont panic and youll probably be fine. If you find yourself needing to stop quickly you were falling to close to be in this situation first of all the worst thing you can do is slam the brakes on. As soon as your tires lock up you are exponentially increasing your stopping distance. Your initial brake input is the most important thing  you need to very gently hit the brakes to start as anything more will cause them to lock. You can gradually increase pressure as you slow down.Step  Watch this video Step  Go find any empty parking lot with nothing to hit and practice stopping accelerating turning.,boston,coh0cys,1,t5_2qh3r

People across from me are clearing their cars by throwing their snow on my side even though i have already cleared it and it looks nice and clean. So i left a note on one of their cars explaining to them that hey i need this side open to put out the trash. So i am in my kitchen and see the guy clearing his car again and doing the same thing. Unfortunately i am cooking and have stuff on the stove so I cannot run out and stop him. He finally sees the note reads it and then continues to do what he has been doing until his girlfriend or another girl in his building who has probably seen me clearing that same spot over and over points out the other snow banks he could use instead.TLDR some people are lazy and see snow removal as making the snow no longer their problem even if it means making it yours.

3200773,0,t1_cotq5js,Ive actually read it! Shoup is an urban planning academic at UCLA in the heart of the sprawl and I just really like the way he wrote the book to make it accessible to folks hence the recommendation.The books main premise is that city planners in the US for much of the th century have mandated free offstreet parking as part of zoning restrictions to ensure that there would still be usable free curbside parking. Offstreet being a parking lot at the site and curbside being on the street. He contests that these zoning restrictions were put into place because curbside parking was already free.The big issue here according to Shoup is that the owners of a lot must now allocate a bunch of space just for parking which doesnt generate revenue. Therefore the prices of things go up in the stores but nobody realizes that its due to parkingjust part of the cost of doing business. This causes cities to have to spread out as the grow since new businesses need to provide ample parking. Therefore cities become decreasingly walkable and people start needing to drive more and more to get to anything.His main contention is that you need to reduce demand not try to increase supply of parkingbecause supply is inherently limited and by increasing the supply youre just increasing the demand of gas and driving. You reduce demand by raising the price of parking which is why he argues that parking shouldnt be free. Trying to plan for demand when the price is free is a nigh impossible task too.He has some interesting ideas around charging different prices for curb parking based on the time of day and the land use too. San Francisco has actually implemented some of these smart meters and its working fairly well! Heres more info about it but this program is heavily influenced by Shoups work.I had to look it up but he has a pretty good passage on free curb parkinggt Some people think cities should not charge for curb parking because it is a public good but curb parking is exactly the opposite of what economists define as a public good. Public goods have two economic characteristics. First they are nonrival in consumption one persons use does not reduce the amount left for everyone else. My listening to a radio broadcast for example doesnt prevent anyone else from listening. Second public goods are nonexclusive once the good has been produced charging for it is difficult because no one can be excluded from receiving its benefits. Again once a radio program has been broadcast charging the listeners for tuning in is difficult. Radio programs are therefore public goods even if they are privately provided. First it is rival in consumption because only one car can occupy a parking space at a time. Second charging for parking is easy. Curb parking spaces are much closer to private goods than to public goods. Moreover the social costs of not charging for curb parkingtraffic congestion air pollution accidents wasted time and wasted fuelare enormous.For what its worth the wasted time and wasted fuel he references there are references to what he calls cruising or driving around in order to find a spot. The idea being that parking is scarce because the demand is much higher than supply leads us to have to search for parking and spend time money and gas in order to do that searching. That part is certainly more applicable to Boston than urban sprawl per se.Sorry for being awfully rambly but its a big topic and the book does a much better at conveying its thesis than I do. Hopefully that helps!,boston,cotrcq4,27,t5_2qh3r

3228687,0,t3_2x0izs,Just like Tobacco tax....We need to tax the bad thing to pay for programs to help people quit the bad thing but as soon as people actually quit the bad thing the state stops getting all the wonderful tax and goes bankrupt. With Tobacco tax which currently collects over a Billion dollars between sales tax per pack and Master Settlement agreement money from Tobacco companies  less the one percent is used for Tobacco Control. Less then one percent. Why? Becuase the Attorney General with the help of TobaccoFreeKids Mass Municipal Association D.J Wilson and Northeastern University Tobacco Control Center Jeffery Gotleib all got together and brokered a deal with the State Government that put all Tobacco Tax money into the General Fund rather than keep it earmarked specifically for Tobacco Control and Healthcare. So that money is used for everything from filling potholes to paying firefighters. This might nit seem so bad to you especially if your a nonsmoker BUT consider that the States remaining smokers are poor blue collar workers and are essentially getting double taxed  once through regular sales and income tax second through Tobacco Tax to pay for the same potholes and firefighters an police etc that You pay for once. Furthermore since the massive increase of smokers actually quitting smoking with the help of ecigarettes the state is in a massive shortfall of General Fund money because people did exactly what they claim they wanted  quit smoking making the state healthier. TDR The state should never apply a Sin Tax to any item they want people to stop there is a direct conflict between the goal of making people quit. They cannot ask us the quit ltbad thinggt at the same time the rely desperately on the tax of that ltbad thinggt to fund Government.,boston,cownpbf,2,t5_2qh3r

Each frame I have to either adjust position scale crop opacity or when Im lucky majority of the time I have to do all of those.  frames in a second so movement for half a second would be  frames. Adjust  frames of position scale crop thats  frames edited per shot. Then you have  maybe  shots up there and that is a lot of precise movement that needs to be done.On top of that  clips have been used.

3364129,0,t1_cpbpidd,gt Ive seen it done across  lanes of oncoming but not with multiple turn lanes.Yea this is accurate can be done as well.By delay crossing do you mean if youre the car going straight and letting the other guy go? If it looks like hes starting to edge out as the light is changing hes going to try and pull left before you so thats a good tip off. If I see a left turn lane and know they are going to get a full green Ill usually just start going slowly rather than accelerating off the line and if they start to move then you just crawl until they go no one behind you is going to care. Personally I usually dont let more than one person go unless that person behind them is following their tail not atypical in Boston or if theres not many people behind me and I know we have a long green light i.e. me delaying wont cause anyone to hit a red who normally wouldve made it throughgt The whole is this guy being nice to me or just not paying attention makes it unclear unless the other person signals. Im afraid to even try it.If they werent paying attention theyd be at a full stop when it turns green but then I gun it anyways because Ill make it across before they do. If you see them accelerate slowly and kind of looking your way then you have the go ahead. If they accelerate normally then just wait.Note none of this should be done in a drivers ed class or on a drivers test haha but I feel its pretty common in this area and if Im first in a left turn lane I am usually expecting to go left before the cars come and if they dont let me theyre dicks just my personal opinion. Likewise I will always delay a bit to see if they want to go.It just sucks at a big intersection when no cars can go left because the lights are timed shitty so usually youve been on both sides of the deal and just as you would want to go left to beat the rush so you should let others turn left when youre going straight.Edit a did not think I would right this much on a traffic maneuver and b I just read the wiki on it and that sums it up pretty nicely in the Process section.

3368495,0,t1_cktoywf,Apparently you are not an attorney who is well versed in constitutional law. It seems that prior restraint of speech is the issue at hand. Because in  this Department Of Justice guideline was promulgated to law enforcement agencies across the nationThe Supreme Court has afforded heightened protection to recordings containing material protected by the First Amendment. An individuals recording may contain both footage of a crime relevant to a police investigation and evidence of police misconduct.The latter falls squarely within the protection of First Amendment. See e.g. Gentile v. State Bar of Nev.  U.S.    There is no question that speech critical of the exercise of the States power lies at the very center of the First Amendment.. The warrantless seizure of such material is a form of prior restraint a long disfavored practice.  dasponge included only a part of the DOJ memo I think the part in this post greater relevance to this discussionSo you law n order groupies the answer is that police cannot seize cell phones from witnesses without a warrant.

Both me and the low income people Im complaining about have enough food to feed ourselves and running water and other basic necessities.

Would you like to eliminate private ownership of housing in general?gt It would mean the government is taking initiative to ensure economically diverse populations within the cityI agree that cities should have economically diverse populations but we need to figure out some way to measure the cost incurred by these policies. Right now it seems like the policy is haphazard and ineffective at the same time  its not making anyone happy or solving any problems.I should probably add here because Im starting to come off as a cold hearted conservative that I am massively in favor of welfare laws and general redistribution of wealth to the less fortunate in most cases. I just think housing is the wrong way to go about it and in many cases I think incentivizes people to stay low income.

4168456,0,t3_38j1v8,Stream of consciousness here...If youre a beer guy worth a brewery tour at Harpoon and Sam Adams.  Theyre a bit touristy at this point but still worth it.If you like to get out and walk AND like history the Freedom Trail is a great way to see the city get some culture etc.Boston has been invaded by food trucks over the last few years that are pretty good.  They rotate on a daily basis and you can look up on line which trucks are where.  Definitely worth hitting some of those up.For touristy restaurants that I like to recommend that are IMHO quintessential Boston my favorite places to send people is the Warren Tavern in Charlestown and the Black Rose in the financial district.  Not the best food at either but great clam chowder at the Warren and otherwise all around good pub food that will show you what Boston is about at both places.  Black Rose for a good Irish breakfast if fun on Sundays.Also the broader area has some of the BEST oysters in the world.  Island Creek Oysters and BampG Oysters are two of the more known and expensive oyster spots where can you get a sampling of all that we have to offer.   Art museums in Boston are worth a visit  MFA and Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum are in the same area and outstanding.  The Harvard Art Museums are also worth of a visit. That being said I wouldnt  necessarily prioritize them over doing some other things if youre here for  daysDefinitely wander over to Cambridge and spend some time in Harvard Square.  Just such a unique place to goAlso were a city on the water so I always advocate a day trip over to Provincetown.  It has gotten expensive for the roundtrip ferry but I believe if you do a day trip there is a discount.  Ptown is awesome.  If you dont want to spend quite that much do one of the ferrys to Georges or Spectacle Islands a part of the Boston Harbor Islands.

Id tack on that the MBTA is one few transit agencies that runs a full complement CR LR HR Bus BRT when SL Gateway comes on SL arent classified as BRT Trolleybus Ferryboat and Demand Response. The only other agencies I know that have a similar panoply are SEPTA has streetcar doesnt have light rail NJ Transit heavy CR focus and MTA  Baltimore MBTA has x the ridership. Everywhere else the modes are siloed into different agencies  NYC has NYCTA MTA Bus MetroNorth and the LIRR which are all part of the parent MTA org  it has the nonMTA PATH and NJ Transit service. Chicago is split between the CTA and Metra SF splits BART from Muni and from Caltrain. LA is split between LACMTA from Metrolink WMATA doesnt have CR but thats what is really is.

4237647,0,t1_cs2zblg,If you rode the bus regularly youd understand that drivers let off passengers before a stop because theyre stuck in traffic and  of the people getting off would rather start walking to where theyre going. The driver still stops at the stop if either asomeone presses the button or btheres people waiting at the stop....but the second stop takes much less time.This ends up making the bus less of a traffic blocker. I see them do this especially on Huntington Ave where there is no street parking and the bus has to stop inlane. Theyre trying to help everyone out.The reason bus drivers leave their bus in traffic is because other drivers are assholes and wont let them in. They have a schedule to keep for hundreds of people on that trip alone. Again as someone who rides the bus drivers often have to wait upwards of  seconds for someone who will let them back into traffic. Ive watched asshole car drivers be so stubborn about letting a bus come into the road that theyll pass over the double yellow line as the bus is pulling out lean on the horn and force oncoming traffic to swerve away from them.Quit your bitching. Youre in a  passenger vehicle probably alone. That bus has at least  people and can hold up to  or so during rush hour.

4398270,0,t1_cskavtg,Vocal fry is the result of using the lowest tones of your vocal cords. In the extreme case fry can be caused by the speaker being unable to control the lowest register of the cords or the same low register spasming causing strange distortion or cuts in the voice. It was essentially treated as a medical disorder when it interfered with normal pronunciation which may have been the origin of the dislike. On the other side of the research some have suggested that using fry in your conversation is a subconscious cue that can suggest you and the subject are familiar or casual which would explain the likely unintentional increased use in marketing pop stars to the masses over the last decade or so.I havent found much solid research that has been done and peer reviewed about why vocal fry seems to be coming back as a popular speech affect in a historical sense. There is a study that has tried to show that even subconsciously speakers with vocal fry are perceived as less trustworthy by prospective employers Anderson . Anderson also wonders if the subjects may suffer later from vocal cord problems due to the prolonged use of fry instead of using it for emphasis. The original study that kicked off the internets interest in the subject is by Wolk .On a personal level it doesnt drive me that crazy  selective use of vocal fry can actually be pretty effective as an emphasis in story telling. I produced radio for a long time and can definitely corroborate that the fry phenomenon appears to affect more strongly females who would usually be classified as millennials.tldr people change the way they speak over time and some people on the internet dislike it because it is different,boston,cslf4b8,2,t5_2qh3r

The ones moving there now are not being pushed out of anywhere theyre simply moving there because the rents seem reasonable to them which are unreasonable to people who currently live there.Revere and East Boston were both extremely affordable for everyone at one time so it was never an issue.  Actually Revere was somewhat less affordable than East Boston.  The gentrifying assholes will be the young white workers from out of the area who then start moving to Revere Lynn and what not because they will think the buildings that will eventually be createdrehabbed etc. are affordable which they wont be to the current residents.There are better ways of doing things for an existing community rather than just push out low income renters to the parameters of the area.

QE is around the corner so well see more of it until interest rates go back up to  which will pop the bubble and whats happening in greece right now will happen to the US.Even if lots more houses were to be built even past the point where home developers could turn a profit on it the rent will continue to go up  per year.

Everyone says seafood but the only stuff thats truly regional these days are soft shell clams served both steamed as steamers and fried as whole belly clams lobster raw local oysters notably Wellfleet and Island Creek jonah crabs and perhaps some notasmarketable fish like porgy tautog black sea bass and bluefish.  If youre staying with your brotherinlaw consider bringing home some lobsters to eat.  Most grocery stores will even cook them for you so you can eat like a king for the lb that they charge for them.  Also track down a  oyster happy hour if youve never had nongulf oysters e.g. Rialto on Mondays.  On the north shore of Boston the roast beef sandwich is a regional favorite. Roast Beast in Allston and Scampo in Cambridge offer decent versions.IMHO the North End has been superseded by the plethora of true regional Italian restaurant that have sprouted up in the last  years in the US.  Its still a neat place and there are some places that serve very good food but the focus decidedly ItalianAmerican.  Places like Pizzeria Regina Galleria Umberto ModernMariasBova and maybe a Caffe Vittoria are the types of places to hit.For beer Cambridge Brewing Company brewpub in Kendall Sq is truly excellent particularly if you focus on the Belgian and barrel aged and maltforward styles. I find their hoppy beers to be frequently underwhelming with a few notable exceptions.  If you want hoppy look for beers from Trillium essentially available only on tap at bars or togo from the brewery.  The NE beer scene is great so this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Near Harvard Sq Cambridge Common usually has a good selection of NE taps for reasonable prices.Regarding ethnic cuisines Boston is reasonably strong in Vietnamese Portuguese Brazilian Cambodian try Thmor Da in Revere assuming a trip to Lowell isnt in the cards  Thai and Sichuan Chinese.Nonperishable food...You could pick up something like maple syrup or apple butter but its not like availability is limited to NE.,boston,ct6rzoy,21,t5_2qh3r

In the sixties most of the secondgeneration children of immigrants moved into the suburbs and the place all went to hell with gangs and welfare and government corruption. At one point the municipal sewerage and pipes systems were loaded with rats so loaded that people actually saw tails coming through in their kitchen sink and floating around in their toilets. The joke that came about was that if you want to solve Fall Rivers rat problem have the Orkin Man or the Big Blue Bug in Rhode Island take a trip to Government Center. Its basically a microcosm of a similar joke about Congress.And dont get me started about the Irish hooligan they used to have as a mayor who tried to intimidate a young upandcoming politician into pulling support for a recall election by inviting him in for a meeting in his black SUV close to midnight and then taking out a gun and plunking it on the dashboard while his goons sat in the back.

But just making up a number is dishonest and doesnt serve to improve your argument in the least.  I dont disagree that it is low enough as to be negligible but making up statistics is doing that fact a disservice.

The rest of the time they tell me to fuck off because they want cash for drugs and alcohol.  Also I frequently see my clients panhandling and I know that these people have a roof over their heads and two free meals per day cooked for them at their group home.  They pretend theyre homeless to get extra money for drugs because control of their money has been taken from them by the courts after one too many drug offenses.  Its just the sad truth.  I think that since you work with homeless FAMILIES its a different situation and I sincerely hope that it is since children are involved.

I ended up making the payment again to avoid getting service cut off but was credited with both payments on the next cycle so it kind of resolved itself.,boston,cuun4jz,2,t5_2qh3r

5425591,0,t1_cw4gs2d,Downtown Detroit is bouncing back hard. Im in my mid s and almost all my good friends from back home on various career tracks are moving into or right next to the city. And no Im not exaggerating almost all of my friends are flocking to the city. The neighborhoods are still a mess and itll be a huge uphill climb to revamp a city with a larger land area than Boston Manhattan and San Francisco combined but downtown is booming as well as midtown and Corktown. If the city can make some good forwardlooking decisions about its future admittedly a big if Detroit could potentially have a rebirth and become a great city to live in again.

5464407,0,t1_cw95lz9,First off I was a cook at Kellys and it all depends on the location in terms of the quality of the food. Revere Medford and Saugus all deal with high volumes of customers while Danvers and Natick are slower. Oh and some people might think otherwise but I can assure you every Kellys location gets their food from the same provider and then follows the same recipes. The food is not different per location.Now Kellys is not being fancy by any means. You know what goes on the roast beef before its cooked? Salt and Pepper. Thats it.In terms of prices Kellys is expensive. I think a large roast beef is pricey I think its around like  now but its also just under half a pound of roast beef .oz and the small is over a quarter pound oz. But they do other food too and they dont pick the cheap quality stuff. Also Kellys does pay their employees well and they have a LOT of employees I was in Saugus where it was  total in winter  in summer.Is it the best roast beef place though? No but it is rather good. Is it overpriced yea kinda. But youre paying for the atmosphere and the food without all the gimmicks.I would say the best food quality is definitely before pm in Saugus at least but probably around like pm and pm. The shift change occurs at pm usually.,boston,cwa4od9,1,t5_2qh3r

Often posted today is too limited and no restriction includes tons of junk.Some realtors will list rental properties on their websites as well.

Were talking about people who take a bus to the train and generally live far away from work.I think raising t prices should be a very viable option and I would willingly pay more for it. If youre concerned about it becoming too expensive for poor people then offer a discounted rate to those that can prove a certain level of poverty.While were spitballing I think that the commuter lines should be market priced and not supported by mbta in any way.

But a ton of people are wearing large black winter jackets with the hood up so they are very hard to see at night. Add in that they are crossing in a place where you dont expect a person to be and you have a very dangerous situation. Of course there are improvements that can be made to alleviate the need for the pedestrian to cross illegally but that doesnt negate the need for enforcement. There also needs to be enforcement of traffic laws to go along with it.

I also dont understand the difference between voting for a tax increase or voting for a formula that determines a tax rate. You can still vote folks in and out if you dont like what they do. The only thing killing indexing did was make it virtually impossible for necessary increases like the gas tax to be politically viable.,boston,d0lalbw,5,t5_2qh3r

How many Feature the city?Ghostbusters was filmed here but takes place in New York. Theres nothing here to see. Black Mass filmed its South Beach Miami scenes in Revere Beach which was staged and then torn down.Movies that take place in Boston as part of the character will still be filmed here. Other movies who are just taking the tax credits because production is cheap could be filmed anywhere and frankly probably suck. You think someone is going to get on a Trolley and want to know where that pivotal secene from RIPD was filmed? No. That movie couldve been filmed anywhere it was just cheaper to film here.And do you think the Departed wouldnt have been filmed here?We have soo much history and already soo much culture I refuse to think we need to lure filming here in the hopes that tourists will get on a place do visit the city where some shitty Drew Barrymore movie took place.,boston,d2jbq0d,1,t5_2qh3r

Now excuse me while I put on my KKK sheet and bitch about BLM on rthedonald. s To be perfectly honest I think its worse that build baby build is a bastardization of an MLK quote because that attitude generally leads to the displacement of minorities when luxury condos are inevitably the only thing thats built. If the phase was meant to be build affordable housing baby build affordable housing thatd be one thing but we know when people use that phrase its generally just about jerking off the free market.

As much as Seattleites love to complain about the cost of housing in Seattle  living in Boston is much more expensive. Rent is more expensive. Restaurants are more expensive. Car insurance will probably be more expensive plus youll receive a tax bill for your car. Utilities will be more expensive its cold here and the old houses are poorly insulated. Plus income tax. If you work on  in Waltham then you probably want to live toward the west side of the city. Brookline is the Queen Anne equivalent in Boston but you cant afford to live there without several roommates. Instead consider Waltham Watertown Arlington west side of Somerville Davis Porter Oak Square section of Allston. Keep in mind there is no real reverse commute  traffic is a little better in the reverse direction but the roads here were not designed to get anywhere quickly.

7826091,0,t3_4mgqpe,Recently made that same move! We were in Fremont in Seattle and are now about a mile from Davis square in Somerville right on Alewife Brook parkway. I commute to Waltham and while its not as bad as people coming into the city its still not good. My commute can be done in  minutes but often takes nearly an hour. The worst part is Alewife to rt  practically gridlocked. Basically my commute is  minutes to go one mile on Alewife  minutes go  miles on rt   minutes to go  miles on  and the road to my office park. Brutal. Anyway the Davis area of Somerville seems pretty fun and hip while still not being too urban. It reminds me a lot of Fremont. We got a two bedroom with laundry and parking for just a little over your price range but were  mile from the T which can be a bit of a long walk.

7866287,0,t1_d3zw8zv,When the Back Bay was filled in the s they dug out a big hill in Needham.  They had trains full of dirt running every half hour  from Needham to Boston running on the Boston and Albany Railroads Highland Branch which is now the Green Line D branch between Fenway and Newton Center.When you go down  through Needham notice those big swamps those were hills at one time.As for the technology they likely used steam shovels to load the cars but they also likely had mine carts and a bunch of guys with shovels doing the majority.  I cant say for sure what they had for equipment but I have seen a map showing where the tracks were to dump the dirt to form what is now the Back Bay.They got it to just above sea level and built the buildings with the basement on the ground then filled in the current street level around the buildings.In those days a hundred guys with shovels was cheaper than a steam shovel.  Before that it was the only way.  Look at the Middlesex Canal built from Boston to Lowell entirely dug by hand with wooden shovels.  Not much of it remains today but back then it was crucial to the industrial revolution in the city where it all started.

7966119,0,t3_4ob846,gt This sniper rifle you can own when youre .  gt This handgun youd have to wait to be .When is the last time youve heard of someone being killed with a sniper rifle? It sounds scary but rifles   even assault weapons  are used in the minority of firearms homicides. The FBI keeps tables of homicide stats although these records arent complete because I dont think it includes Florida and Alabama and Illinois provided limited data.  There were  murder victims in  where the victim was killed by a firearm and the kind of weapon is specified. Of these  were killed by a handgun while  were by a rifle.gt We must be doing something right because Massachusetts has one of the lowest rates of gun deaths in the entire nation.There are two things that are kind of misleading about this. Firstly most gun deaths are suicide more than  but the implication is that they are homicides. When you compare Massachusetts to our two neighbors to the north in  Massachusetts has . gun deaths per k versus . for New Hampshire and and . for Vermont so the gun deaths stat checks out sourceHowever when you compare the number of firearm murder victims you see that MA has . per k New Hampshire has . and Vermont has .. I arrived at these figures by crossreferencing the FBI murder table by state with  Census numbers Wikipedia has a similar table but the numbers are from .In other words gun control is probably pretty good at preventing firearm suicides but focussing on assault weapons and sniper rifles isnt going to matter in that context. Meanwhile the difference between the low murder rate in Massachusetts versus the high one in the District of Columbia has more to do with income inequality than gun laws and I believe DC has the strictest ones in the nation. Since a criminal can buy a gun from a neighboring state or area while a law abiding citizen will probably not want the hassle statebystate gun laws arent going to impact crime that much.,boston,d4bgu0l,13,t5_2qh3r

That would be someone who would do things like repairs e.g. fire alarms and who might function like a leasing office of sorts while not actually being the legal landlord.  I spent a period of time as a rental agent and this sounds like a situation where the property management is arranged to keep the landlord insulated from ever having to do more than collect income on the property.  Basically none of them want to touch this with a  foot pole and theyre hoping youll figure it out on your own e.g. break the lease but do their work for them by getting replacements.The Boston housing folks have already basically told you the right course of action.  Short term involve the police if your roommate is a real threat to your safety.  Long term lawyer and maybe court.  Gut instinct is that a lawyer may be able to get you out of the apartment without you having to find a replacement roommate.

8939210,0,t1_d7mb00m,Well you asked so here it goesIm Dominican like born and raised in the DR Dominican so trust me I can tell when someone is native from Latin America. Now figuring out whos probably an illegal immigrant is a more nuanced but there are some signs that can pinpoint at someones status in a country such as language skills lack thereof and general demeanor around mostly old American crowds like the townies that hang out around Fenway and Allston. Illegal immigrants at least the Latin kind which are the ones I can figure out are less likely feel comfortable in these type of environments because they are clear outsiders due to their lack of understanding of the language and by extension their lack of understanding of the culture of said place where the language is spoken. Theres also the ever present feel that in these mostly traditionally American crowds someone will figure out their immigration status and will somehow report them to the pertinent government authority. That paired up with the general inferiority complex most Latin Americans feel towards the US makes for a very bad time in those types of environments which is why I wouldnt think youd find illegal immigrants the Latin kind in Fenway. That and the fact that Fenway is expensive af and I dont think people with little money would want to go spend their cash there especially if theyre not going to have a good time. That said I know this is a gross oversimplification of a very complex matter and that there will be many exceptions to this statement. ,boston,d7md08y,9,t5_2qh3r

9021919,0,t1_d7w8hii,Let me try to clarify.  My friends in DC live in a neighborhood that was pretty bad until recently.  Now its up amp coming and there are people who worked in the industry to gain experience saved their money and then go out on their own and open small restaurants were talking a bar that can seat maybe  and fewer than ten tables.  There are some great little places you can go to like that within a few blocks of his house.  Its the same in a bunch of other neighborhoods there too and Ive seen the same type of places in Phillys neighborhoods.  Of course they had to get a loan to open it but the problem in Boston is that the loan will have to be so much larger a big part of which is the artificially high cost of a liquor license if they can even get one that a small place like that will be extremely unlikely to have the revenue stream for a bank to agree to terms for that sized loan.  Theres nothing inherently wrong with investor backed restaurants but theyre not going to back the people like Ive described whove been working hard and have the ambition and an idea to open a small place in one of the outer neighborhoods because they wouldnt get enough of a return.  Theyre going to back someone who either already has a successful restaurant to open another location or back a celebrity chef where they can market name recognition and its going to have to be big enough to provide that return.  So thats more what Im talking about the restaurant landscape could be much more interesting citywide here but it is stifled by the economics and a big part of that is the artificial scarcity and high cost of liquor licenses.  There are plenty of small commercial spaces on the main streets of Dorchester Roxbury Hyde Park etc that could support a small neighborhood joint like Ive described if the cost and availability of liquor licenses was more in line with other cities.  Ive watched the trend of liquor licenses going downtown from more residential areas for years and it sucks there have been some efforts to change this but not nearly enough.  ,boston,d7wakm1,2,t5_2qh3r

These people are so extraordinarily unlikely to smoke and drive that it is ludicrous to talk about them  even when it was decriminalized their fearrespect of law and order kept them from consuming marijuana which is an entirely victimless crime. Now we are expected to believe that this same person upon legalization of marijuana is going to not only break a much more serious law but also endanger everyone around them by smoking and driving? It doesnt make any fucking sense.The people that are going to be smoking and driving are already smoking and driving.

IIRC it took about  months between legal wrangling and waiting for the snow to melt so they could install the dishes. But once they launched actually hooking up was quick and painless.Weve had a couple of short outages so reliability is on par with what I had with Comcast but its way faster and cheaper so I would absolutely recommend them to anyone.Note that their big building service called Concierge is somewhere in the neighborhood of  but does vary depending on the building wiring some buildings are apparently faster and some are slower. But if youre in a single family or small building their offerings are substantially slower and thus less appealing.Oh and there was no cost to the building.

9507518,0,t3_5b19c0,Sure.Doing it by the book is close to impossible. In a perfect world you have to do a couple of things. Get an insurance policy. Call your insurance company tell them the MakeModelVIN and activate the policy. You can usually do it over the phone in under  minutes. If you intend on breaking the law to transport the car home like many people do this should be the number one priority.. You need to have plates on the car if youre going to drive it. You are allowed to transfer the plates from a car you havehad IF and only if you recently sold the car the plates are registered to. In the real world no one follows this rule and law enforcement officials actually have no way of knowing whether or not you actually sold it due to the grace period.You will read a lot of shit online about using an IN TRANSIT plate or just carrying around your title and bill of sale as a substitute for plates or a million other nonsensical suggestions. None of it is accurate. What I described above is the only way to do it in MassachusettsSo if youre OK with bending the rules activate the insurance policy and slap on the plates from your old car and drive it home. Get it registered immediately.If youre not OK with bending the rules Do the transaction and ask if you can leave the car there until you square away the registration. You would have to come back with your new plates and then you can legally drive it home. Or you can tow it. Or you can just have the seller drive it to your place and drop it off using hisher platesregistration if active.EDIT You can also just YOLO it and drive it home without plates or insurance which unfortunately is what most people do. You will probably get screwed over pretty hard if you get caught.,boston,d9l05tb,2,t5_2qh3r

And then in the s music was going alternative. Not racist none of that was. Ive also noticed many in power whether at publications or in office pretend to be centrists but really are working for major donorsinterests. I look at much of the media we do especially our streaming live show as being in the center and not influenced by ... I advocate along with the marijuana industry side for instance on marijuana reform but would never side with them for a monopoly or anything closer to that in the name of safety regulation etc when I know its really about consolidating the market for their benefit. That to me is altcenter a term Ive been throwing around since I hear lots of talk of altright and altleft. Altcenter does sort of describe where we are at on our streaming show and in my writing. The altcenter term I was throwing around to me denotes media that is not in the tank for the left or right. Not much media like that in my opinion. Many pretend to be that but how many are really advocating for moderate positions based on financial considerations? I contend many in the corporate media and with elected offices or public budgets are acting in favor of . Is one a moderate when they cowtow for safety regulations that favor certain industries? I think not. I advocated with members of the marijuana industry for reform but would never ever advocate for a monopoly for them. We do a live streaming show that features libertarians greens democrats republicans etc. We are not partisans but focused on issues. Alt center media is one to me that speaks for consumers and voters. Not for corporations grifters or cartels like most of the media in Boston that pretends to be centered but favors public offices and large orgs in their reporting....,boston,dart85j,1,t5_2qh3r

I tried to order over the phone and the customer service rep was so obnoxiously insistent that I had to get cable so my husband could watch sports he doesnt particularly like sports that I hung up and ordered online instead.The installation guy showed up on time answered all my questionsconcerns and at my request didnt remove the existing copper phone lines. Google around for illustratedvideo guides on how to prepare for the installation.

A long line of old cases stands for the proposition that a landlord does not have a duty to mitigate damages. However consumer information booklets published by the state A Massachusetts Consumer Guide to Landlord Rights and Responsibilities and tenants rights organizations MassLegalHelp say that landlords do have such a duty. Its probably fair to say that in practice that is in trials and negotiations which are not published and do not serve as official statements of the law landlords are expected to take steps to mitigate and fare poorly if they do not mitigate but still sue to collect rent from longgone tenants.

If not youll be in a bus line that would look similar to Boylston St. when Apple releases a new Iphone. You also wont be paying less than  for anything youd ever be proud to call home.Expand your horizons and go down  or  stops. The JFKUmass area is ideal for someone working in Quincy.

Many of these people are often found passed out drunk in public places from a churches front steps to a park bench to the grass out front of the library to lobbys in apartment buildings to fire escapes you name it weve found them.It is an awful life for them. They are outside in freezingwet conditions. They shit in public and often leave the waste behind. They have to beg or steal to eat and they also presumably steal their alcohol or use whatever money they get from begging. Interestingly our homeless dont ask for money very often so I suspect most of its just stolen.The authorities just cant come by and throw them into a van and take them to a warm safe place indefinitely. They can do this in short bursts but they cant legally keep them in a place for a long time. Back in the old days they would just round them up and send them to Danvers State or another local mental hospital.Since most of those places are closed you have to be extra crazy to actually be sent to an institution and those who go to those seem to get out and return sooner or later anyway.Its a really bad situation for everyone.

This time a lot of people stayed home or voted for Jill Stein if they felt disillusioned with Hillary.  That didnt happen with Obama.  If the liberals who had shown up in  and  showed up this past November she would have won easily.The only thing I blame her for is not campaigning in the rust belt.

Theyre going to do the same shit to you.PSeditleaving signs up claiming there are bedbugs or saying things like hey so when are you going to take care of the rat infestation? to the agent will result in you being rightly threatened with legal action for tortious interference libelslander etc. Stick to the facts like Im sorry the place is a mess.

10739019,0,t3_5tllnt,For the people that are skeptical there was an article in the WSJ several months ago about this similar trend.  They tracked average number of houses for sale in the metro area over the past  or  years and over the last couple its plummeted.  There have been months where fewer than  houses will be for sale.  A lot of this is due to prelisting transactions youll notice ads or things on zillowtrulia that say coming to market in  weeks and it NEVER makes it.  Houses that do make it to listing are selling in a few hours and over list.  The effect is like a tidal wave or something people are getting driven further and further out into the suburbs if they cant afford the rising prices.

But you want people to be able to park near their house when its like this outside because for a lot of people its necessary. Kind of like a seasonal handicapped spot.  Whats happening now is youve got peoples older parents and people with back or knee problems shoveling out their spots then young ablebodied people taking them. That older person now has to walk half a mile in snow and ice to get home. That can get dangerous. Thats usually met with the argument that they should move to Florida. Like the only people fit to live in Boston are under  with no health problems. Id argue that character is more fucked up than an occasional slashed tire or keyed car. I think as these kids age theyll realize why space savers have persisted for so long because theyll start to need them themselves.For the record I dont think vandalism is the way to go.

I supported pot legalization but it would be better if the people in charge of implementing a policy support said policy.If we threw out the Mass constitution which is from  and had proportional representation in the legislature then the people would have more than two choices and representatives would better reflect the prolegalization citizens of this state.

You can even keep doing that all day if you want.Hubway bikes are heavy and slow by design so you probably dont want to ride them up steep hills.

We dont have anywhere official where you can submit a transit proposal. If you mean things which have undergone some sort of planning work or environment review then theres not a whole lot recently. The study for Blue Line to Charles is the only thing I can think of from the past decade. There might have also been a study into Blue Line to Lynn  years ago. Further back to the s and s there was planning for Red Line to Lexington and there might have also been studies for northern and southern extensions of the orange line.Theres also the Vision for  map that the MBTA made a few years ago which included GLX and various Indigo Lines which would have amounted to running high frequency DMU trains down inner commuter rail lines but that proposal was scrapped soon afterwards.,boston,dgcqzq4,9,t5_2qh3r

Compared to buses which can be as frequent as every  minutes on some streets the train schedule is just too sparse for the line to be useful to most people. ,boston,dgv4cx2,20,t5_2qh3r
11779078,0,t1_dgv1g9p,Agreed. One good ride on the T will be all she needs. Preferably the orange line after pm or the green line at literally anytime of day ever.,boston,dgv72ci,16,t5_2qh3r
11779438,0,t1_dgv8g9z,Youre only here for school.  Youll get a job back in Cleveland or San Bernadino and move there to be closer to home. Its not your fault.  Most Boston companies only recruit from out of state because they want slaves with no friends and no social lives.  ,boston,dgv8jb5,13,t5_2qh3r

Shell fucking hate the Sil I guarantee it. Make sure to take the B line there for maximum effect not the  or the . Nothing says welcome to Boston like riding on a cattle car at walking pace. Once youve had your fun showing her the depraved part of Allston go to Sunset. Its chill and they have  beers.My last suggestion would be the Common this weekend during the Climate March. If she hates crowds shes gonna have a real bad time.This is all assuming shes slightly well adjusted. Dont do this to someone with panic attacks or something thats just cruel.,boston,dgvcply,27,t5_2qh3r
