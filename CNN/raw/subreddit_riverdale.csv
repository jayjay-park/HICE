I just wanted to shake him and be like STOP THIS. The party was...weird. I feel bad for Archie. Thats not a way you treat a victim. He was the victim of a predator. I also didnt like how Val treated Archie. Like dude youre at his house. Show him some respect. Did you really expect to come to his house and not have him try to talk to you? I get that youre mad at him but hes trying to apologize. I get hes drunk but you dont have to humiliate him. Also I completely forgot that they have a dog. When Jughead was petting the dog was I like Who brought their dog to a party? Overall I did like the episode though  the Archie and Veronica scene at the end was cute. The Jughead and Betty scene at the diner was cute. I feel weird rooting for Archie and Veronica when I started off so strongly thinking Betty and Archie were endgame. How things have changed.

But then I hear the things other characters say and I realize this is just a Riverdale thing. She does seem like a larger than life kind of person sometimes. At the same time I think she seems very grounded and quite selfaware. She has a very specific code of ethics dont slut shame dont bully right your wrongs ask for forgiveness and humble yourself. She listens to the people who want to compromise with her and she takes time to deliberate on making certain decisions. She can tell right from wrong and she also is selfaware enough to know that people are hurting because of the things that her parents have done and she takes ownership of that!

11689083,0,t1_dgkiwci,No problem! Yeah Riverdales ratings are pretty modest even by CW standards but thankfully CW takes into consideration a lot more than just live viewing ratings in their decisions to cancelrenew shows.   For example there were two other shows that debuted this year besides Riverdale on the CW No Tomorrow and Frequency. Both shows debuted to similar ratings as Riverdale. A .. premiere which later dropped off to a ..ish. For No Tomorrow it was worse because it debuted behind The Flash which premiered to a . rating in the Fall when ratings are generally higher on a Tuesday night and No Tomorrow didnt really retain any of that and debuted at a . rating before tapering off to a .. rating. Contrasted to  yrs ago when iZombie debuted in Spring behind The Flashs . rating to a . rating still not much retention and dropped to a steady . rating. No Tomorrow was canceled because unfortunately there just wasnt much traction on social media DVR or digital streaming. iZombie however with its creative team in Rob Thomas and acclaim plus social media  DVR  digital streaming made it a keeper for the CW. For Frequency it was paired with a mediocre Arrow leadin during the Fall so it didnt have a fighting chance as its social media  DVR  digital streaming wasnt enough to generate a second season. Arrows season premiere this year was already pretty low by its own standards . and Frequency premiering at . pretty much spelled DOA especially as it later dropped down to a .. rating as well. Riverdale though has the unfortunate battle of being aired on Thursday nights which is heavily dominated by Shondaland on ABC so premiering at a . in Spring is considered soft because its a new show with a lot of hype in comparison to its lead in Supernatural which is in its th season and has a higher rating at . but because of its strong social media DVR and digital streaming presence not to mention its builtin fanbase and recognition from the Archie comics brand and cost of filming the show meant that the CW saw its potential and renewed it asap despite ratings having dropped to a .. In all honesty Riverdales performing on par with all the other CW shows that arent superherorelated like iZombie the  Jane the Virgin etc. The only reason why some people might criticize its ratings as soft or modest is because its a new show whereas those other shows on the CW are all well in their rd seasons. But again CW values a lot more than just live ratings and with the current TV climate in America leaning away from live viewing its only natural for ratings to drop and for the CW to look at other factors before deciding to keep or cancel a show.,riverdale,dgkz4lu,5,t5_2u05c

11708012,0,t1_dgn44d3,I liked the fact he was opening up to Betty and vice versa because it showed a level of trust which has developed between them but I just wasnt keen on the dialogue. Idk it just felt a bit too selfindulgent to to sound realistic for me. Dont get me wrong im a fan of this scene especially how they avoided going down the route where one character would react unreasonably and fly off the handle just for a cheap shot at conflict.  Im just nitpicking at the dialogue which slightly took away from my bughead happiness and has been bugging no pun intended me throughout the series.,riverdale,dgn4stt,3,t5_2u05c

11750013,0,t1_dgrthjm,To answer your question whiteness  nationality. In the USA at least the majority of Greeks are given a certain privilege according to their skin color. Of course if a person has a different background but has been naturalized in Greece i would call them a POC. It all depends But overall in the US Greeks would fall under white. Yes stamos is Greek but he is also white. I know the definition of whiteness changes depending where you are. For example in Europe Western Europeans are discriminated against so It really depends where you are. But at least in the USA i would call john stamos white. I could go more in depth about immigration and the American narrative that plays a role in making Greeks white in the US but Im running late for class. ,riverdale,dgrw68n,5,t5_2u05c

11758082,0,t3_67rard,More plausible than my initial reaction. Weve seen how the Blossoms tried to ensnare Archie into the Blossom family perhaps Clifford had been likewise recruited. As historical precedent it used to be common among Japanese families to formally adopt grown men as heirs if they didnt have any male children  I dont know if that tradition still exists today.It also makes sense with the fact that Cheryl is devastated by the revelation of the murderer  not just because its her father but also because she finds out that Jason is not actually her twin  theyre only halfsiblings. Think about how distraught Penelope is at Jasons death as well as Cliffords stony silence combined with her outright hatred of her daughter  totally understandable if Cheryl was Cliffords love child with another woman that to hush up Penelope had to pretend was her own. Growing up Jason was the only person who could protect Cheryl from Penelopes abuse which is why she got so attached to him.,riverdale,dgst45u,15,t5_2u05c

It introduced this in the final scene? x introduced another example of how alone Cheryl feels and how much she hates her parents and knows they are manipulative.

11806798,0,t3_68ekfr,I dont want Riverdale to be more realistic per se. I like Cheryls ridiculous and obviously scripted oneliners. I like Jugheads mopey loner melodrama. I like all the families dressing by strict color codes as if they really just stepped out of a comic book.But I agree that Riverdales storytelling suffers from an inability to follow through with consequences. Archie should have grappled with the Grundy situation long after she left to predate on another town. Bettys mental illness should consistently inform her character instead of popping up here and there when the writers think its cool. They chose to add these elements to their story so its their responsibility to explore them to a satisfying conclusion. Right now Riverdales throwing a lot of stuff at the proverbial wall. And its hard to care about any one plot beyond more than an entertainment level because you dont know whether any of it will matter in the end.,riverdale,dgycamh,3,t5_2u05c
