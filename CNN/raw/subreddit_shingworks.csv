3399730,0,t1_cpefhno,Yeah its complicated... I definitely dont pay for things unless I care about the person and want to support them their message. Otherwise I wont watch read whatever their work. Sometimes Ill find out in retrospect that the person is kinda crazy or weird like Scott Adams or Orson Scott Card or whatever and stop following their stuff. But IDK I have taken money for jobs from people who I strongly strongly disagreed with. Part of me justifies it by thinking that Im supporting myself my work my views with income and making a living is the way I can make my own work and spread my own views? But on the other hand I do feel problematic about it sometimes. Im still refining my opinion on this as time goes on... ,shingworks,cpfsmvx,2,t5_35jyc
