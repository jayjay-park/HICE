An imgur album would be best choice.  Im afraid Ive never used imgur before otherwise Id offer to help you set one up.  Im sure its not that difficult though.

422690,0,t1_cfojb8s,heres my initial thoughts on the  thing and to be honest I havent thought them all the way throughI love that theyre incorporating the date in the movie but Im also wary about how theyre kinda side stepping the issue away from the harm America did to the Japanese people back then. The original Gojira was born from our folly and that mistake took physical form. Here theyre kinda suggesting that we were far more innocent and were actually trying to destroy him despite the devestation we brought to their country.All this is kinda null and void since over time Toho themselves rewrote Godzillas origins Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah but I guess to counter this they alluded to the fact that we might have created something worse MUTOS according to Cranstons speech... so maybe theyre still keeping the essence of Godzillas birth but just changing it around?,GODZILLA,cfoks43,1,t5_2ruhk

Kiryu specifically if Legendary is somehow able to make a crossover with Paciic Rim creating the ultimate Jaeger based off of the big guy himself.  If not this could still be a great follow up to the failure of MUTOs or whatever they do to try and kill Godzilla in the new movie.

I actually havent seen Mothra or Mechagodzilla .  I am working to rectify this as we speaktype.As far as GvKG goes on reflection it was probably mostly the fact that the only official copy I can find is the terrible dubbed version but even still that android dude was the WORST.  It has been a while since Ive watched it but since I still only have that same version my hopes arent terribly high.Edit Watching the Heisei Ghidorah movie right now.

1030771,0,t3_25wqur,Part The wait is over! Godzilla is here! However has the wait been worth it? Heres my spoiler filled review.... This is meant for anyone who has already seen the film themselves.After what seemed like an eternity of waiting its hard to believe that Godzilla is finally here. Not only that but in its opening weekend it has grossed a Godzilla sized profit nearly  million worldwide!As a huge fan of the franchise who has had to defend my love for the genre to people who could not understand how anyone could be interested in the tired old cliche of Japanese rubbersuited giant monsters thrashing miniature model buildings? Despite whether or not I felt the movie itself was any good I have to say that having Godzilla at  in the box office feels like a justified dream. Finally even the naysayers cant deny that theres something appealing about the  year old character outside of our own little niche interest group.That said did I like the movie?I find it hard to separate myself from the fanboy in me to really answer that honestly. st initial viewing I came out singing its praise emotionally charged after what I had seen GODZILLA on the BIG SCREEN! I saw it again a day later and was able to really take it in for what it was... its a competent film and I believe the director Gareth Edwards achieved everything he set out to accomplish. He wanted to channel the same type of slow build up and suspense like other films he grew up with Alien Jaws Close Encounters of the Third Kind and to that degree I think it worked very well. We dont see a full reveal of Godzilla himself until nearly  min. into the movie but by that point it was really something that needed to happen. As an audience member going into see a movie called Godzilla you would expect to be treated to the titular character at some point... To quote Dr. Ian Malcolm of Jurassic Park Ah now eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs on your on your dinosaur tour right?. Thankfully to the films credit Godzillas reveal was amazing! Both times Ive seen it gave me goosebumps chills and the biggest jaw dropping grin no movie has ever given me before it is truly breathtaking. However I think there was a little too much padding and teasing then was necessary. I feel the movie and the editing could have been a bit tighter and to the point... Once the giant ft tall giant lizard was out of the bag I dislike that he is once again hidden away for so long afterwards. If the characters were supposed to care about in between those long awaited moments were a little more interesting then maybe i could forgive the time were given away from the monsters. Such as it is the characters were very stock and bland with few exceptions.Concerning the charactersIf I were to say that I had one major complaint it would definitely be that lack of personality of the characters. I dont blame the actors because I feel they did the best with what they were given but I do blame the writing mostly for not developing them into more interesting people to root for. Ive seen each of these actors in other films or tv and know each of them are incredibly talented and its a shame I couldnt love them more here. Each role in this movie feels very stock and that theyre just going through the motions as it were to move the story along. This is especially disappointing because Gareth hand picked these actors to give his movie some depth and emotion. Instead I found myself more emotionally attached to the monsters more on that in a bit.Elizabeth Olsen plays Elle Brody wife mother nurse... She serves as a beacon of urgency for our main hero Aaron TaylorJohnson to come back to amidst the chaos but it would have been nice to see her do more than become a scared crying mess. Shes a nurse it would have been nice to see her overcome the devastation that surrounds her and be a a strong female character. Maybe have a few scenes where they show off her medical knowledge in the field... in other words give her something to do! Something I found kinda funnyillogical was that she sends her helpless son away unbeknownst to her straight to the heart of danger so that she can sit back and wait for her military trained husband? Who needs who more in that situation? If she had said I need to stay behind and help other patients evacuate then I would have been more forgiving of her actions. Her motivations didnt add up for me.Aaron TaylorJohnson plays Ford Brody father son military EOD specialist... Beyond that I know nothing about the character or why I should care. He conveniently finds himself smack dab in the middle of every situation that calls for him to be the hero archetype and follows through like a paint by numbers example of what a hero should do in every situation hes given. He has a tragic past he lost his mother disconnection from his father a wife and child lost in the city but all of that becomes a secondary to Go here do this jump out of this plane deactivate this bomb. Apart from a few phone calls to his wife I never felt the urgency or motivation for him doing the things he did other than he felt it was his duty to do so because nobody else was there to do it.Ken Watanabe plays Dr. Ichiro Serizawa scientist researcher the movies voice of reason... His role plays into several things at the beginning none of which really pan out in the end but at least he had some pretty cool deep quotable things to say... the movie starts out with him trying to track down and locate the source of these strange seismic disturbances that ultimately lead up to the reveal of the main antagonists in the film but once all of the monsters are out in the open Serizawa takes a back seat to the action. As a researcher once the monsters are found his role is reduced and he has little else to do for the rest of the movie. At one point they show him later on in the film and I remember thinking oh thats right hes still in this!. If there was one character that Id like to see return for a sequel its him. Despite the fact he was put in here as a fan service the name Serizawa holds a connection to the  film I think he had the potential to be really interesting had the story allowed him to be.Before I move on to the one character that I did absolutely love Ill quickly mention David Strathairn who plays Admiral Stenz and Sally Hawkins who plays Serizawas assistant Vivienne Graham surprised she has a name? I was! Theres no point in trying to label personality traits for either of them they are simply there for filler. Stenz being an authority character that is needed to make authoritative decisions none of which make any difference in the end and Assistant whatsherface is there to just follow her sensai around and look worried albeit in a rather oddly cute way.Now for the most developed character of the entire movie and best casting choice... Bryan Cranston plays Joe Brody husband father engineer... The movie begins with him being concerned about unusual seismic readings at his job site the fictional nuclear plant Janjira. He sends his wife Juliette Binoche down inside the plant to try and investigate but while down there the plant suffers what is then known as a large earthquake. Theres a reactor breach and Joe has to make the hard decision to contain the gas and prevent it from being exposed to the atmosphere at the risk of losing his wife.. All this of course happens on his birthday. years later he is still torn up by his decision his wifes untimely fate and the fact that he knows theres more to the story than what is being fed to the public. Cranstons emotional drive and determination through all of this really sets up a great start to the movie. Every scene hes in he steals the show... its because of this that it becomes all the more tragic when he ultimately meets his own fate some  minutes into the film. I feel he sets the bar really high in the beginning that no other character is able to live up to. Its unfortunate that the brilliant marketing really highlights Cranstons performance in a way you really thought his role would have more longevity. It was a bit of marketing trickery and I dont blame them for doing so but for a film that rests much of its screen time on the shoulders of characters its unfortunate that we had to say goodbye to the most interesting one so soon.,GODZILLA,chlgcqk,3,t5_2ruhk

It was definitely the biggest WTF of the Heisei series though Spacegodzilla comes pretty close to matching it in the weirdness department. The only negative things I really had to say about it were that the assassin was ridiculously cheesy almost but not quite too much and the big fight at the end was way too short.

Theyre like the top monstrologists from the nowdefunct MONARCH so itd make sense for them to be recurring characters.

1732381,0,t1_cjxhcrc,ContinuedAs for the bulk of your rebuttalgtThe symbolism of Godzilla and the Mutos is changed because quite frankly nuclear proliferation isnt as key an issue these days as it was in .You are right it isnt the same kind of issue. That being said this film did address modern nuclear elements like nuclear waste much as later Godzilla films did when the threat of nuclear annhilotaion wasnt present and aged nuclear weapons but those elements were attributed to the MUTOs and not Godzilla. This is a problem I have with the film since Legendary invited a new creature to carry this nuclear banner when the plainly obvious choice was Godzilla. However once again Godzilla needed to be a hero so they didnt have an antinuclear message associated to Godzilla. Furthermore Godzillas antiwar and nuclear message has been championed by MANY people film critics fans perhaps even you as a key aspect of what has made this character great of the years. In my opinion even if this point is no longer relevant to todays society this is something that needs to be honored in the character since this is a key aspect to his origin and character and a point of praise for the franchise.Ishiro Honda Takeo Murata Akira Ifukube Tomoyuki Tanaka Eiju Tsuburaya and Akira Ifukube were all affected by World War II and nuclear weapons. Max Borenstein Gareth Edwards Thomas Tull and Alixander Desplat frankly are not and it should come as no surprise that one of the elements to go in this movie was the original symbolism of the first Godzilla film.gtThe Mutos are symbolic of the disasters we unleash through our tampering with the planets ecosystem.Somewhat but again in the nuclear corner you have. Discovered in a plutonium mine.. Attacking a nuclear reactor.. Attacking a nuclear submarine. The Yuka mountain nuclear storage facility. Being attracted to an eating nuclear weapons.Environmentalism is an aspect but there is a STRONG argument of the nuclear thread.gt We dig deeper than we should and in our lust for natural resources unleash creatures that could doom our speciesAgain a plutonium mine. If this film had been about the dangers of nonreusable energy and global warming I would agree and actually might like the MUTOs more. Instead it clearly has to do with radiation and nuclear power.gtGodzilla represents natures ability to fix the damage and in that process we wont be able to do much more than bunker down and pray we make it out alive.When mankind conflicts with nature monsters are born. Godzilla  This is an element of Godzilla that has been a defining aspect of this character. Godzilla generally is the monster that RESULTS from an imbalance of nature not the thing that returns nature to balance. This is again a misstep. The original script called for Godizlla to conflict with humans more but those elements had to be scrapped for some reason. Are we to instead congratulate Edwards and Borenstein for getting the very basic element of a kaiju film correct? What do I mean by that?Please tell me a giant monster movie that does not revolve around a monster attacking humans until an outside force satiates their anger and the disaster is over. Humans are helpless against the monster onslaught and can basically only get out of the way. Godzilla vs. Megalon and Godzilla vs. Gigan BOTH have this element.This is not some kind of profound message. This is monster making .gt You complain of missing symbolism but youre too blind to see the symbolism has changed.I did NOT say that this film didnt have symbolism. I said that compared to the first movie this film has white washed Godzilla character and symbolism to prop him as a hero. This film certainly has a message but compared to Godzilla  its very weak safe and wishywashy.gtLast I checked Godzilla in this film did what he always does walk right through everything humans throw at him without even caring. No destruction? No death? Are you blind or are you dumb?He certainly does. However the film makers specifically are unwilling to actually SHOW this element on screen. Godzilla doesnt directly kill humans in this film ON SCREEN. In the first Godzilla movie he blows up tanks police cars fire trucks news reporters. It implies that he kills women and children. A little girl is fatally irritated by his attack. This isnt in Godzilla  plain and simple.gt The damage from Godzillas arrival in Hawaii alone would make s casualties seem light.This is I will agree the strongest Godzilla is destructive scene in the entire movie but again the death aspect is not shown. Their casualties are simply incidental to his desire to attack the MUTO .The only corpses you see in this film are once again due to the MUTOs escape at Janjira. Furthermore Godzilla would not have even bothered humanity if it hadnt been for the MUTOs in this picture. He spent  years chilling in the ocean. You see the Tsunami but you dont see the death. Godzilla  is willing to show the death.gt What about those cruisers he capsized in the ocean?Accidental. It was also SF Bay not the ocean.gt What about all the guys on the Golden Gate Bridge?Not shown on screen. The Bridge doesnt collapse afterwards. If you look at the shot play by play he smashed through a place on the bridge specifically where the military is not. He also doesnt kill the military despite them shooting him. He in fact saves a bus full of school kids and humans are able to escape.gt Or dont they count since it suits your argument?They would if they had the balls to actually show it. This is a PG movie however.gt Godzilla is objectively not a hero in this movie.This is hilarious. This contradicts what Thomas Tull has said.gt Hes an uncaring neutral force out to kill what he sees as competitionSure who just happens to align with humans in interest and is therefore the hero of this picture.gt That his intervention saved us and some characters are clearly grateful doesnt change that.Sure and other Godzilla films do the antihero element better while still showing his destructive power. Not this film.gt There was no moral dilemma because it wasnt that kind of movie.I dont disagree here. But the end result is not as profound or meaningful as the first film.gt In  Godzilla was a film that depicted the dangers of unchecked scientific discovery and the proverbial genie unleashed from the bottle by the use of the nuclear bomb.Sure and Godzilla  is also about nuclear mining nuclear waste nuclear weapons etc.gt The moral dilemma of Serizawas discoveries reflect this as hes in the same position the scientists in New Mexico had been in and chooses to avoid repeating the creation of a new superweapon at the cost of his life. Godzilla s human drama reflects the natural disasters were unleashing on ourselves a family separated by distance and the cataclysm mankind unleashed on itself. Ford is driven by his desire to get home to his wife and child and if he has to sacrifice himself to buy them a chance at survival he will do so. To reiterate its a different kind of story for different symbolism.Again I dont DISAGREE that this is an element of the film. I however dont believe that it is that profound of interesting of a message. There isnt a morality play on screen. Each character is single minded. No one at the end of the picture goes hmm maybe it was a bad idea to use those nukes or kill the MUTOs Instead humanity claps at Godzillas victory. Compare this to the somber ending to Godizlla . Grief on Yamanes face. Odakas disgust. Serizawa is dead. Yamane warns that if nuclear testing continues another Godzilla might return. Those are plainly different levels of symbolism and meaning.As for the rest of your post. A string of insults about my intelligence while calling me a troll.,GODZILLA,cjxj4th,2,t5_2ruhk

1869385,0,t3_2g0gz1,While I have no doubt that Edwards believes he directed his actors to be in a state of prolonged shock from the events that were happening his only previous movie  Monsters  features the same blandness from its actors long before during and after the monsters in the title show up. I think hes just not a very good director of actors. Aaron TaylorJohnson is a blank slate from his first frame long before any of the events of the film have impacted him. His interaction with his wife and son at the beginning are almost entirely sterile.Thats putting aside my disdain for a character who  after being away from his son for over a year  promises his son on his first night back that he will be there for him in the morning and then takes off for Japan in the middle of the night to bail the father he despises out of jail instead of making the father stew in prison for a few hours so he can keep his promise to his son.You know what though? Edwards directs a good monster sequence. Every scene featuring a kaiju and every fight sequence is excellently done. Thats the reason I go to see a Godzilla movie and  despite my disappointment in the human aspects of the movie  is why I look forward to buying this movie and watching the hell out of it.,GODZILLA,ckegd6q,2,t5_2ruhk

3012576,0,t1_coa0mc7,Well put. To me its an applesoranges comparison.PR was meant to be an homage to the silly GodzillaKaiju films.  Basic plot lots of action and fun overall.  The robot and monster designs were excellent.  Beautifully designed and rendered.Godzilla was meant to capture the gravitas of the original film which it did well and it had an excellent cast to boot.  While Godzilla looked great the MUTOs were piss poor designs.  Too clean geometric and easy to render especially with the majority of the battles fought in the dark.  I really think they took a shortcut there.  Compare the MUTO designs to PRs Knifehead and Otachi for instance.  Those were wonderfully designed and rendered creatures.Theres no need to pit these two films against each other.  If anything we need more movies like this.  ,GODZILLA,coa92h3,1,t5_2ruhk

3121529,0,t1_coljhqq,gt Or you know maybe we buy from NECA because theyre regularly releasing decent figures at an affordable price.Ephasis on the last bit. The only figure thats debateably  better than import alternatives is the  Godzilla and thats only because they get actual resources from the movie to make the figure as screen accurate as possible. The NECA  has better articulation and more quality materials but is more stylized. Their  Godzilla is medium sculpt quality with bad materials and articulation and the same can be said for the  Godzilla. Hence why I said  kiddies on this subreddit cant afford anything else so they line up to take it from NECA at every opportunity.gt Their  figure looks great from what weve seen. And we havent really seen it outside of displays it definitely looks like the best theyve made so far but the bar is pretty low.gt My biggest complaint with NECA is the short tails and green finish on the  and  GodzillasAnd if you were paying more than  at your local Toys R Us youd definitely pass on them. They are not great figures they are budget figures.gt  figure is fantastic and more accurate sculpt wise then the Monsterarts figure is.Agreed that the sculpt is more accurate but the  MonsterArts quality is miles ahead.

4557383,0,t3_3dgj9m,When it comes to Godzilla game reviews that grade on a point scale my rule of thumb has always been to add a point or two to the final score depending on how fanservicey the game is.  Theyre Godzilla points and basically theyre how I account for the fact that Ill just get more enjoyment out of a Godzilla game than a nonfan reviewing it.  Based on the gameplay videos Ive watched the scores that have been coming in mostly between  make sense once I slap on my  Godzilla points because holy shit theyre knocking it out of the park fanservicewise.  It looks like a .  Fun to kill a few hours with here and there but not something Id sink ZeldaFallout amounts of time into.  I think reviewers are salty about the price too if this came out at  I think youd see reviews tick up a point or two and thats before my sillyass Godzilla points.  Also sounds like lots of reviewers that missed or forgot the PS days of tank controls.  Not that I like tank controls but if any character makes sense to control that way its huge lumbering kaiju.Reviews are subjective so Ive really grown to love review aggregators like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic.  RT got even more useful for me when I fully understood that the percentages they show for movies arent meant as a grade but rather how likely you are to enjoy it. Itll be really interesting to see how this game stacks up once a ton of reviews have been accumulated.  Itll be especially interesting to see if theres a difference between the critic scores and fan scores.  ,GODZILLA,ct52t6r,2,t5_2ruhk

6995363,0,t1_d18c11z,It comes down to how the character is developed and used.  In Gojira theres a build up to his destructive abilities.  First boats are destroyed out of an unexplained sea of flames then Godzilla makes landfall and destroys with his sheer size and by the time we see his atomic breath as an audience youre pretty much expected to just be scared because its used to wipe out what is viewed as mans last hope of keeping him from destroying the world and suddenly holy shit he just melted down all the electrical towers.In Godzilla  we arent made to fear Godzilla so when he finally uses it theres room to think about it rather than just be in awe of it which opens room for questions more so.

8203881,0,t3_4rn7ih,This is a tough call for me. Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is batshit crazy sloppy fun while Terror of Mechagodzilla plays it straighter boasting a tighter narrative.  Both have their wacky elements juxtaposed with some relatively serious elements and both feature truly kickass monster action and entertaining human stories.Terrors combo of alien invadersmad scientistrobot girl always sat a little strangely with me and Ive never quite been able to pinpoint why.  Normally Id gobble up a plot that overthetop but I think maybe it clashes with the movies more serious tone? Or maybe its just too many elements? Like if you dropped one piece of that triangle the story would run a little smoother? Its a bold choice though and it gives us some great moments with our human characters.  Katsura her Einsteinhaired father and even Titanosaurus are tragic characters to varying degrees and only rarely does the movie slip off into melodrama which is pretty fucking impressive.KG though... man its a timetrain  straight to bugfuck crazyville.  Time travel evil white people wearing teal suits in a flying saucer Godzillasaurus Godzillasaurus eating US troops in WWII M! Its all amazing and thats without even getting to the badass monster action which is easily some of the best in the Heisei series.  KGs human characters arent nearly as compelling as Terrors so the movie doesnt have the heart that Terror does. Instead it presents a parade of delicious but less substantial insanity.This was a tough decision to make but Im going Terror.  I hate voting against KG its by far my favorite Heisei movie but Terrors focus and heart put it over KGs airy nuttiness. Terror is a fitting sendoff for sShowa Godzilla. Seeing Godzilla wade out into the sunset is satisfying and in a weird way kind of comforting Godzillas going away but hes out there somewhere getting some muchneeded RampR.  I just wish Minya or a healedup Anguirus could have been waiting to meet him at the waters edge. ,GODZILLA,d531fje,3,t5_2ruhk

Sequences in End of Evangelion are a direct middle finger to otaku as well breaking the fourth wall to do it.

For some reason the later Showa films and the HannaBarbera series have permeated the culture over here so heavily people believe the series became that immediately after the original but thats not the case at all. Like any long running series from James Bond to Godzilla there have been gradual changes to the character and franchise. Godzilla went from villain to antihero to hero in the Showa era and Id argue those changes made sense considering the cultural shifts in Japan at the time. When Toho revived the series in the s he went back to antihero where you have the best of both worlds Godzilla is destructive but fends off the REALLY bad monsters. For the most part this has been his MO since then but most people are unaware of the newer films to care. And of course there are always going to be people who see them a silly foreign films with bad effects and all the other lame stereotypes repeated ad nauseam but we know how well made and fun these movies can be their standing in Japanese pop culture so who the hell cares what they think. ,GODZILLA,d6e2tzt,2,t5_2ruhk

There are people out there who acknowledge movies they dont like as good films sure but for most people quality is tied to enjoyment which generally requires resonance with the substance of the film whether that substance is theme character action whatever. In Shin Godzillas case specifically that substance is the commentary in the bulk of the talking scenes so if that goes over your head which it did with that reviewer antiAmerican satire is far from the only thing Shins got going on it will be harder to enjoy the movie. And if what you miss is a big part of what makes the movie good then you arent gonna call it a good movie.,GODZILLA,d8a1s5x,3,t5_2ruhk

9223088,0,t3_56lhej,For me I would definitely say the MechaG line has always been a problem for Godzilla. If we dont count Godzilla as the strongest kaiju I would definitely say that all of the MechaGs could fit that description. MechG  was basically a allpowerful machine gun that could only be stopped by the power of magnetism. . The MechaG from Terror of Mechagodzilla improved on the design and even had help from Titanosaurus. GvsMGII was planned to be a finale for the Heisei series killing off big G and letting his son continue the ropes. You can clearly see in the film that MGII is a impenetrable fortress and was very close to killing G in the film Luckily he had Rodan deusexmachina. Lastly you have MGIIIKiryu. His powers were specially designed to kill G and honestly if it hadnt been for the genetic memories messing everything up Kiryu could have probably easily defeated G in either GxMG or SOS. You can see in the films that Kiryu was doing pretty well in each fight where he was not going insane.,GODZILLA,d8l3ej8,3,t5_2ruhk

9248762,0,t3_56qq0s,Really liked how it started.  films deep into a franchise and you dont need a lot of setup. Something strange is going on in the ocean and soon Godzilla reveals himself.This movie is ultimately about how the Japanese government and the governments of the world would respond to some incredible event like a Godzilla attack with absolutely no warning. A lot of the time its done in a tongueincheek kind of way. Very satirical. I like that a lot.Think of all of the multinational political discussions in Godzilla  and thats basically what the human drama in Shin Godzilla boils down to. I thought the characters were well written. It was interesting to see how the events and how the world dealt with them unfolded.The Godzilla design itself looks great at times and not so great at others. The sheer size of Godzilla is really felt as this truly is one of the best shot Godzilla movies to date. The technical filmmaking was mostly superb. The music was great throughout as well but the meshing of old and new tracks felt kind of clunky at times.A lot of the Godzilla action is slow and lumbering like the beast himself and theres really only three major action sequences but one in particular was amazing. When Godzilla uses his abilities for the first time its powerful and awesome. One of the best moments of the entire franchise.All things considered I liked the movie a whole lot. Dont know where it stands in my rankings yet. That will take at least a couple more viewings. Ill tell you though if not for some questionable CG effects and stiff Godzilla action this would be WAY up there.,GODZILLA,d8ocjzh,3,t5_2ruhk

9704129,0,t1_da98ev6,Well thats kinda what Im pointing out.  Who wins or loses isnt really important.  Narrative is because Legendarys series is really narrativedriven so far.  And with the idea that Legendary isnt truly interested in ending the series with GvKK theyre going to want this thing to end off at a point that leaves both monsters open for use in potential future movies pending continued license from Toho and Universal.  So my argument hasnt really hinged on there even being a winner in the truest sense so much as a compelling fight which ends up with them both being ultimately on the side of earthhumanity.  This positions them nicely going forward for potentially furthering the franchise beyond  movies.  So in that sense the only thing that would truly surprise me is a dramatic heelturn by either one of the two monsters or either of them being killed off to likely be replaced by a younger offspring.  I dont see either of those two things happening though because it would ruin the branding and compromise what characterization can be had with two giant monsters.  My arguments and predictions stem soley from what benefits the series from a franchising and narrative standpoint and in this I could be wrong.  They could try an entirely different method of furthering the franchise that treats both monsters as either interchangeable with other similar creatures we all saw how a similar idea worked out for  Godzilla so doubtful treats each monsters respective relative alignment as uncertain more plausible but still unlikely since it would limit their marketability or alter their abilities in some significant manner which I think would completely compromise the initial vision of Legendary hurt what made Godzilla  so good introduce possible Deus ex Machinas and possibly lower the likelihood of continued Toho licenses.This is why I like to debate and discuss this line and hear peoples ideas.  Im interested in seeing what people think is a likely route to a successful franchise which goes beyond the usual direct comparison between King Kong and Godzilla in a who would win assessment.  Theyre going to do what works best for the franchise regardless of what we want so this thread is much more about what I think is compelling from a narrative standpoint and what type of characterization of King Kong would make that aspect better.,GODZILLA,da98pzj,2,t5_2ruhk
