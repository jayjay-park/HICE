2237592,0,t3_2k8um1,I actually really like Table Flip. Its interesting to have all these different people with different personalities come onto the show and play. Half of the guests Ive never heard of then I go and check out their content.

2341856,0,t1_cm15dp2,Yeah I do think its important to consider that. In retrospect I dont know how much longer Game Grumps could have gone on in its casual downtoearth format with Jon and Arin. When something keeps growing in popularity it has to expand and certain things are lost in the transition. I dont fault the show for changing but I do think it sacrificed what made it unique in order to do so. In some ways Im glad Jon left before it become what it is now I just wish the circumstances of his departure were different.,VentGrumps,cm15zai,10,t5_340ix

On top of that Jon was really excited to have him on and the music held a special place in his heart.

2608359,0,t3_2pptes,Theyre both bad games with a lot of flaws theyre just very different in the reasons why.The reasons why  is terrible are obvious and they made the game frustrating but still a lot of fun. But Booms also not a fantastic game yes it looks more polished and finished than  the environments look kinda nice and everything else but like uKewl said its a boring game.     The combat looks really repetitive you can pretty much tell when enemies are going to show up and theres probably going to be  maybe ? sets of them and there seems to be little skill to it just button mashing and the occasional enderbeam. Also I dont think theyve been actively avoiding the upgrades theyve gotten a few most of the time Arin hasnt had enough to get what he wanted because he hasnt got enough crowns or something. And while theyre a nice addition I doubt theyd make the combat any more interesting...  Then theres the rings issue as well rings everywhere but you can only hold  and you rarely go through any combat and even when you do lose rings in combat you get them back very shortly after. Arin seems to be often going for rings even though hes at the limit most of the time. I know you can get an upgrade to  but I think they couldve thought of a better system for them overall.  Also the lack of minimap or anything bothers the hell of out me to keep having to go through the menu to look at the map and it doesnt even tell you what way youre facing. I feel like that couldve been done better too.    I dont think theyre desperate to recreate  or anything if they didnt play it when it came out chances are there wouldve been a ton of requests from the fanbase telling them to play it. It doesnt help that every Sonic game they end up playing is going to be compared by the fanbase to  as its seen as the most iconic grump series.I mean Dannys said he actually doesnt mind Boom and they talked about the brokenness  a little bit in Part ... of course some parts are better than others but thats the same with pretty much any series really...edit a word,VentGrumps,cmz1t5a,3,t5_340ix

3398193,0,t3_2z495u,Yeah it really just depends on what you want out of the Game Grumps. Jon and Dan cover a lot of the same ground both sing a lot and are pretty good at comedy. Jon knows about games and can have conversations involving things like game design. Hes good at being genuinely wacky which is a really hard thing to pull off. Dan is a good Straight Man and hes good at telling stories because he has so much life experience or can fakeembellish it. Dan doesnt seem to have the same connection Jon and Arin did on the show though. Jon and Arin met after they both realized they liked each others videogamecomedy content and their first real life meeting was them sitting down and playing video games together This is something they talked about when they played Mario Land . Game Grumps was basically just Hey why dont we record us doing what we already do and we can joke around to entertain people and make some money out of it. Dan and Arin started grumping because Jon left and Ive never heard any sort of story about Dan and Arin playing games together as friends having fun just as a part of the show. It wouldnt surprise me if Dan and Arin never considered playing games together before the show because Dan just isnt an active gamer. They can be great friends but the chemistry doesnt work as well if they arent doing something they both really enjoy.,VentGrumps,cpfmc1q,5,t5_340ix
3402197,0,t1_cpfzj8g,The shock for me was absolutely because it was out of nowhere. I was way more into the Grumps back then I was watching almost every episode within a few days of it airing. There was less stuff because there wasnt any side shows or extra content or anything else just the Game Grumps and very rarely a merch video. I was excited because I had been watching the Grumps get closer and closer to beating Sonic  for MONTHS and less than a week before it would have ended Ode to Jon appeared in my feed. The worst part for me was that it absolutely seemed like Jon was just fired out of nowhere because there was no explanation just Ode to Jon. If they finished the series and then Jon and Arin BOTH announced that Jon wanted to move and couldnt continue on the show but would get back to Jontron it wouldnt have been so bad. The fact that a daily series that nearly lasted  months was cut off right at the end just made it look like something really bad happened and they just wanted to hide it. I was a huge fan of Egoraptor in the past to the point where I voted for him to get on The Tester and watched it even though I hate reality TV. The week or so after Ode to Jon aired was when my favorite content creator Egoraptor died replaced by Arin Hanson.,VentGrumps,cpg2qvu,7,t5_340ix

Hence the name gamergate tying into the Watergate scandal. It started out with Depression quest and journalists basically selling reviews for sexual favors while not disclosing any potential source of bias.Its also pretty obvious which side those edits on wikipedia are coming from.An SJW is a person who seeks to belittle the struggles of a group because their skin color happens to be white or they happen to have a penis and are happy with said penis. The SJW is this weird radfem conglomeration that is frothing at the mouth about perceived injustices in the west while ignoring those in the developing and third world.

Also the stalfos and lizalfos do respond to your movements and attack patterns. He just ignored the fact that they did so. Lets also note that Arin only talked about  enemies out of a roster of like  or .I know what Arin said happened.

I really cant understand how thats petty more than it is preferences. I dont owe anyone my subscription. I can pick up a free edition of a magazine because I like the content of that one edition but still feel like the magazine as a whole isnt good and not subscribe to it. Also Im really tired of people on this sub coming back in their comment claiming the person who disagrees with them is downvoting all your comments. You honestly dont know that Id argue that youre being petty by making those assumptions. Maybe you were downvoted because someone felt you calling someone petty didnt add to or encourage the discussion that it originated from.

I understand how else are you going to make people aware of your sub right? The frequency is what bothers me. Also excuse the tinfoilhat moment Im about to have but I cant help but wonder if the reason moderators from rconspiracygrumps and rventgrumps were added to the mod list in rneogrumps is so you can get away with spamming your own place. Thats just speculation on my part though. Ive been to your sub but its barren and honestly there is next to nothing different from the main sub.

Being called a lovely makes it sound like theyre sucking up to me cumfaggot is much more casual and just sets the mood.Dan told a story near the end of the Sonic Boom playthrough I think about how people are usually nervous about new friends since you dont know what lines to cross and whats acceptable.

I guess it might just be what Im used to. Take someone like Chuggaaconroy for example. He does extensive research on the games he plays on his channel and is super informative about the game during his series. It just makes it much more enjoyable for me knowing someone knows what theyre doing. Of course blind playthroughs can still be interesting and fun to watch like Dan playing Shadow of the Colossus.
