2469227,0,t1_cmgtldr,It had been a long time since Svalstrom had spoken his mind to the other dragons. Again he felt empty and consumed happy to listen as the others conversed. He wasnt quite certain whether his intrusions had been noticed but the other dragons failed to give any sign of it. Only then Svalstrom realised that he was quite different from the others present. From day one he had learned to communicate in words rather than feelings. He still did that too of course but not quite as much as Das and Briam appeared to be doing. From time to time sleep crept closer and a struggle ensued for control of his eyelids. Dozing into the realms of shadow he suddenly was thrown back. Briam was explaining humans. That interested him enough to lift the shroud of darkness from his eyes.His own hatching story was quite dull if he compared it to the others. He remembered a distant curse which had awoken him from his slumbers. Then the presence of familiarity had slowly closed in his position. Exactly why he didnt know but he had made up his mind the moment the presence nearly touched. Quite shaken when the expected contact hadnt happened protoSvalstrom had almost gone back to prenatal sleep when the presence suddenly reversed its course of action. Then birth. ,Eragon_RP,cmgw8ze,1,t5_2wot0
2549541,0,t1_cmrcjdi,All Im saying is youll attract more attention in the upper city and I doubt that anyone would argue with the elves and Kull. Believe me Im not thrilled but Naakhrz definitely has to be in the lower city investigation and if Torhven went with them theyd kill each other before they got into the gates.Anduil and I know how to handle ourselves in cities Torhven can keep quiet and the two of you might appreciate these cloaks I brought. Theyve got hoods but it might be hard to disguise the ninefoot tall Kull. With horns.Handing them the mottled gray cloaks he went back to the recently arrived Anduil. Were going into the main of the city with Torhven whenever the bastard arrives. Sevre Nill and Naakhrz are investigating the lower city. Any more objections?,Eragon_RP,cmrd1xq,1,t5_2wot0

2654719,0,t1_cn52rav,The ringing in his ears was deafening. Highpitched and unrelenting it just went on and on and on. Torhven blinked. Something was wrong. His back was against the wall but he did not recall being tired. He frowned and wrestled control of his arms. Holding them in front of him he examined them thoroughly. A couple dozen small gashes were littered over the surface like the face of the moon. Then he noticed it the throbbing.His stomach it throbbed like there was no tomorrow. Torhven grinned. Might be hes right. A rather large piece of bedtable had now also taken up the mantle of spear. It reminded him of Ugly Island. I thought we were done with spears. A smile of irony joined the grin. At least its not my bowarm. Suddenly pain. Like a blot of ink in a clear pool the pain flared out across his body. Clenching onto the bedtablespear Torhven tried his best not to scream. It worked. At least the cold is preserving my dignity. Instead he grunted a grunt worthy of a Kull. Whether the stench had already been in the air or if the speared rider only then took a blot of air might forever be unknown. He had eaten very little recently but it was clear as day that it had been enough to form at least a considerable amount of mandung. He wouldve retched if there had been anything to retch up. Blood was spilling out like a red waterfall intent on drowning out the world. Ah... thats where that ocean came from Torhven thought drowsily. For some reason he was very very tired. ,Eragon_RP,cn53o32,1,t5_2wot0

2714822,0,t1_cncmk5f,Looks like hes really going to do it Svalstrom remarked as he and his rider noticed the short boy wander in their directions. Hes really going to give us a talkto.  The notion clearly amused the dragon and Torhvens face was decorated with the most graciously mocking of smiles. For the lack of anything better to do the huntsman had been cleaning his nails with the skinning knife. Only a moments time was needed to conjure an appropriate greeting. All bow before the most glorious of leaders whose leadership in no way endangered the mission or his own bloody dragon at multiple points during it all.Naturally Torhven didnt actually bow before the bard. Glover had somehow managed to get knocked down another rung on the ladder of classifications. Neither dragon or rider were too impressed at that feat of daring do. ,Eragon_RP,cncnxlr,1,t5_2wot0
2786868,0,t1_cnko9o3,Flames danced before his eyes as they did within. It was a beautiful sight but Torhven knocked the coin from the boulder. In the dirt the fire was quenched quickly. Priorities.Right now the priority was to get to Svalstrom. The gold was red hot but even so he slipped it into his pocket. Woodsmen in the woods move fast and that is what Torhven did. Rushing through the undergrowth he rapidly closed in on the forests edge. The grey dragon was on his feet awaiting his rider. Svalstroms voice was as usual cold and calculating. Get on Torhv dragons.Torhven did and together they launched for the skies. The Iron Dragon extended its presence to all riders nearby. These shrieks what do we know? Central communication is essential. At the same time they searched the horizons for clues... Where did this come from?,Eragon_RP,cnkuv3u,1,t5_2wot0
2789575,0,t1_cnl5ecl,A sigh escaped Glovers lips as he withdrew the velvet roll unfurling it to reveal a set of fine picks as well as a thin stiletto knife and something that resembled a miniature pickaxe where the arms folded down to be parallel with the handle. I left Ceunon long before Akrath hatched. I left Ceunon on my fifteenth birthday and I ran. I brought my lute I brought my pack and I ran. Its a wonder I survived but I did. A team of sailors on leave in Therinsford brought me with them to Narda and from there they sailed to Teirm. I played as a bard but most establishments wouldnt accept a stickthin fifteen year old with a masterwork lute inside so I was stuck in the divebars in the bad part of the city. From there I met Karl. Karl was the head of the Teirm Thieves Guild and he had a fine ear for music. He brought me to the headquarters and I played for him and the other thieves. I would play for them during the day and when night fell I went out into the city and I stole. I had a code you know. I never stole from anyone not able to recuperate the losses and I never killed. I would ratherve been hung from the gallows or have my hands cut off than have killed. I was a damned good thief anyway and it didnt take long to rise in the ranks even if I still played in the morning and afternoon. On my seventeenth birthday I said goodbye to my friends in Teirm and I set off back to Ceunon but I was temporarily held back due to some business I had with a woman everyone called Shadow one of the informants. She had some blackmail on me and I ended up having to pay off some debts before I left. Five months of indentured servitude later I finally arrived in Ceunon and thats when Akrath hatched. I rushed into my old masters home ready to beg forgiveness when I saw him in his bed. He lifted his arm and pointed to Akrath and said Kill the purple beast in your arms. Save me. I left and sat in the alley nearby crying in the gutter while it poured. An hour later I came back inside and found the old man lying there dead. I ran just as fast as I had when I was fifteen only this time when I showed up in Teirm I played half the day and left to stay with Akrath the other half. Thats when I learned to draw. At least Karl understood the value of a skilled artist in his guild and let me stay even though my habits were much stranger. Six months later Karl saw the Gedwy Ignasia and hugged me wishing me luck. He sent me out and said that if I ever met another Guild thief to tell them how I was doing for him and to visit him again if I was ever in Teirm.,Eragon_RP,cnl5y19,1,t5_2wot0

That little dream romp didnt necessarily count seeing as it was completely illusinary. Approaching the onceoverflowing crate Nill ruffles through its contents. He couldnt imagine a situation arising when he would need much more than his sword and magic but he grabbed essentials. A few water skins lots of vegetarian rations and some extra clothing. Remembering his impromptu transmutation on the earlier mission he makes sure to grab half a dozen steel daggers and an extra whet stone. He then casts wards to protect against strong winds rain extreme cold and finally one for physical blows.Packing most items away he makes his way over to Chep. Its good to see you master. I was wondering if you had a few extra gems I could borrow?

She smiled a warm smile. It was a hard place it would make sense why so many fell. She offered the man some fruit out of kindness... it seemed like the right thing to do.

Distracting herself she shared the good news. Das is going to have twins Rythi. The two seem strong and proud. A wide smile and a bit of surprise when Gndlir popped back up.Rythi this is Gndlir hes a necromancer! Also hes a rider too. She said happily. Gndlir  dont let her looks fool you shes  now...  shes only half elf too but that too is hard to tell. Her happiness could of been a miasma itself it was bleeding out of her as it was from Das.
