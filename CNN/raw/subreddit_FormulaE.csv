1397527,0,t3_2a2bk0,gt The most controversial feature is the fan boost where the three drivers amassing the most social media votes get a . second burst that increases the power of their car by  and which the drivers call push to pass. Agag says complaints that this interferes with the racing misses the point If it doesnt interfere what would be the point of the fans voting? But we will take care to make sure the effect is not too big. If youre last youre not going to win the race with fan boost but if youre second you may win at the end.Which is stupid as hell and completely fully and utterly misses the point of all racing. It becomes a question of who will be the most popular and get the boost instead of who will be the fastest driver. It seriously stops being racing at that point no matter what the goal of it is nor what experience people deliberating about that have. It becomes a show of electric vehicles and Id rather watch Top Gear instead.,FormulaE,cirglk7,3,t5_2vpfj

This is one of the reasons that he performed better at the end of the seasonI expect a close battle between the two next season like the last  races at Battersea park.

However from a fans perspective it was great to be able to go to London for a day and have an easily accessible race. Some of the circuits have been a bit rubbish but Im confident that things will settle over time.,FormulaE,d9o1tv2,14,t5_2vpfj

10059707,0,t1_dbi7xrf,Its not a bad thing that Formula E is getting to the point where the drivers need to be full time Formula E drivers. The motorsport world will lose talent to Formula E but more talent will be brought in to fill the other seats.So Formula E is healthy enough that world class drivers can and have to be full time Formula E drivers in order to compete with the best in their class the talent pool gets less diluted on the global motorsports stage and the class of driving in Formule E improves. Everyone wins! The wild west of Formula E drivers taking a handful of other drives throughout the year may be no more but it was new for a while and its getting less new. Things are getting shaken down the series is growing. It is cool that guys can split WEC and Formula E but is that really whats best for both series? Is that even tenable long term? Its hard enough being competitive in one series the work it takes to get to Formula E or WEC is intense. Doing both is insane. Props to the guys who can do it but I bet theyd be a better WEC of Formula E driver if they did one exclusively.,FormulaE,dbisylm,4,t5_2vpfj
