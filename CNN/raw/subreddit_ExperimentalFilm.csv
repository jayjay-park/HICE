1857757,0,t1_ckcv21p,Thanks for the feedback! Im glad you liked it! you should show your friends Dgtwhen the die rolled around and fell off the tableThe die actually didnt fall off the table it just happened to stop out of frame. I never actually considered that it fell off the table but that was an interesting theory! gt its better to let things happen on set that are totally not expected. Things like that add to the filmI actually had to explain this to Mr. Lamountain several times as he would create this idea of how it should be in his head and stop preforming part way through a take if he made a minor mistake but I think I was able to drill it into his head after a while. Im glad you liked the montage! Its one of my favorite parts! fun to make but you are right about the audio personally all of my complaints about this short are about audio. But despite its flaws Im happy with it  Its the most effort weve put into a project and we hope to make more short films that stray even further from cinema norms. Thanks again for watching! show someone else who might appreciate it as much as you,ExperimentalFilm,ckd1zfr,2,t5_2t56i
