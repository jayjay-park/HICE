Compulsive exercising is a form of eating disorder but your behavior doesnt sound disordered enough to be considered disordered thats such a silly sounding statement but its true.  An eating disorder is with you for life youre never fully cured they just go dormant.  I think it sounds like youre doing pretty well.  Could you be doing better? Probably but thats why its important to remember that its progress not perfection that we strive for striving for perfection is what got a lot of us into this mess.  If you freak out about not getting exercise then make it a routine but not one thats seven days a week if you plan for days off it should also lessen the anxiety if you miss a day because you can always make it up on one of your planned days off.  If you make exercise something routine youll normalize it and hopefully normalize the way you feel about it.Maybe try to squeeze some vegetables and fresh fruit into your diet your kidneys will thank you high protein diets can be hard in the kidneys.  More than anything just cut yourself some slack youre good youll be ok.,eating_disorders,dcdl0ix,1,t5_2zzq8
