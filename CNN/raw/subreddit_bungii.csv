8384766,0,t3_4tupdl,This guy is going to be in a world of hurt from looking at his website. It states that there are limits for what you can do if they screw up. There was a case that went to the federal level involving a very large company that would nullify most if not all that. Sure it may scare the average person but if you screw up it most likely wont be joeschmoe taking you on in arbitration. My pickup with a loaded toolbox only comes in at over k and its not a com vehicle because of the regulations regarding com vehicles. If you are running this business and as you claim have done a few hundred jobs already you should be well aware of what constitutes commercial vehicle.Bet when you or your guys get pulled over its going to be interesting. I just want you to think about this not scare you. No cdl is understandable since they may be under CDL weight but being a commercial driver you need to follow different rules and regulations wether cdl holder or not. You must have not ever met a motor carrier inspector that his wife fucked the moving man. Ignorance wont save you.Its the details that will get you and your legal team sucks do you even have one because half of the shit you posted on your website wont save you. Please be careful because ultimately your last load of the day should be you at home safe and sound. If you want advice ask but what youre doing is plugging a polished business that is clearly not ready for primetime that will fail because the corners you are cutting wether knowingly or not. I want you to succeed but honestly you need a different perspective than that your friends that you went to school with you need a professionals viewpoint.,bungii,d5pn77l,0,t5_3fjk7
