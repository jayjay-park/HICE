8420930,0,t3_4uxv0w,There is no real story yet only some hints in the opening scene. Your brother disappeared it seems. The whole setup is more strange than scary. A whole town where everybody is on some mind altering drug called Joy. You forget to take your pill and end up being a Downer not happy person so you have to escape and end up on a tiny island where there are more downers.Its not a horror game in the sense of zombies or other monsters. The only enemies so far are all the other people.Your job is to escape from this place and possibly find out what the history is.If you know some dystopian science fiction like Orwells  the movie Brazil Lems Futurological Congress maybe Clockwork Orange you get a better idea what the overall feeling of the game is. More on a psychological level than gore.,wehappyfew,d5u5qfi,2,t5_37887

8437839,0,t3_4v73pz,Hello! I am the better part of three hours in and my personal favorite aspect of this survival game is the story and setting which are very different from most other survival games because this game dares to touch topics that most people are probably too afraid to tackle. The central idea of the game is basically a retelling of the Pleasure Machine conundrum  would you want to live in a world where you can be happy free and positive for the rest of your days even though you know it is all a sham and the world is actually rotting into Hell as we speak. But why should you care since you have the option of being happy and reality doesnt need to affect you for the worse if you dont want it to? This question is a fun game for philosophers to play but a lot of common people dont talk about it because they either are not familiar with the question or they do not want to be judged for their responses which can be controversial depending on who you talk to.We Happy Few doesnt care about the controversy and it does so by caring too much about the results. Whether you want to live happily or live honestly is up to you as long as you are aware of what each of those routes entails. With happiness comes delusion with honesty comes sadness and those are the questions that need to be asked. Its less about do you want to be happy or honest and more about do you want to be happy and delusional or honest and sad? From this question alone you obtain so many possibilities of choices and consequences that result in an interesting dinner discussion to say the very least.So in my roughly three hours of playing We Happy Few I was not impressed with the gameplay mechanics. If I wanted open world exploration I would have played any Bethesda game since Morrowwind and if I wanted a genuinely good crafting system I would have played Minecraft. If I wanted  a stealth game I would have played Thief and if I wanted a food simulator I would have played Cook Serve Delicious!. But what We Happy Few does provide you with is the sad sadistic terrifying and disgusting world that is a conceptual reality and forcefeeds it to you in such a way that if you want to think about your own life and world through the eyes of others you are going to bite off more than you can chew and you are going to chew more than you can swallow. But at least We Happy Few does this without any reservation which is saying a lot more than a lot of other videos game today are willing to survival or otherwise.And the best part about all of this? The game is less than  completed and it has maybe about  minutes worth of actual story. I cannot even begin to imagine the world that I am going to be a part of in the next year or two when the game is fully released. ,wehappyfew,d5w9pb3,8,t5_37887
8519076,0,t1_d661ep1,There could just be a small handful of useful books inside the library which would be enough of a reason to go in there but not gamebreaking once achieved.  Also considering the Hamlyn government is big on censorship its likely the place would be locked down.  A stealth segment where you have to navigate between and on top of bookshelves would be interesting.,wehappyfew,d66g1db,2,t5_37887

8911143,0,t1_d7iwv4u,Yeah we dont have control over the website version.  We tell them when its available and usually they put it up quickly.  However because they do it manually unless we get it out on Thursday our time it means it wont be done until Monday their time.The Galaxy client is fully up to date.,wehappyfew,d7izmhk,1,t5_37887
9300172,0,t1_d8uldoi,I just realized that youre probably one of the games devs  respect. Sorry if I sound condescending!That CPU is pretty decent. Did you look at any hierarchies or are you guessing? According to CPU Boss the Am is faster than an iK using all of eachs four cores which this game can utilize. Its faster than a Q in both single and multicore too. Also p is x as many pixels as x but I know there is more to it than that. Also you do know what Intel laptops more often than not come with a combined CPU and GPU as well right? I will be testing this later today so we can all know. If it runs like crap I can always play on my PC.On closer look special instructions namely AES encryption are what make up the standout differences between this A and other chips. I sure hope you managed to implement that somehow into the game! I know I know..Are the min specs for  though? That would help me. Also  the res she will be playing at I doubt it will need more than GB VRAM. She doesnt tend to care about eyecandy as much as me.,wehappyfew,d8uv3pn,1,t5_37887
