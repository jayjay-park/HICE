4699113,0,t3_3f4xvd,Force yourself to flush before you look  I sometimes do the same and question why its a different consistency etc. the reality is  so many factors are taken into account when it comes to our stools.What we eat when we eat how much exercise we got in a certain day how much weve been sitting down the list goes on. Our stools would never be the exact same unless we were robots and did the exact same routine and ate the exact same thing and had the exact same thoughts each and everyday.Just understand that its normal for stools to be different most of the time if you are really worried go to a Hydrotherapist to get checked out. ,HealthAnxiety,ctmv1zx,2,t5_2vmoc

My Health Anxiety started small a tiny infected cyst. Eventually I convinced myself I had bladder cancer. Its funny when you said that the doctors were more interested in getting on the antidepressants I completely related. I have now started the antidepressants! I am hoping they will help.

The effectiveness of treatment increases highly with early diagnosis too so you are definitely in good hands!Its normal and reasonable to have these kinds of fears even if they feel irrational and I would try to think about something else if the fear creeps into your head.

7549869,0,t1_d30cxju,Not good. Sadly the one time I decided to ignore my anxiety and wait until my doctors appointment instead of going to an emergency one I probably should have. Dentist couldnt find anything really wrong with teeth shes pretty sure I have trigeminal nerve inflammation or somethings like that I need to see a neurologist tomorrow. Pain is getting worse define not imaginary cant even touch my temple without crying and whole right side is throbbing.  Its horrible not just because of pain but also now I am worried that nobody can tell what it really is and what caused it. And that again makes me go back to omg I am dying route.

7573334,0,t3_4j1nhl,Yup go to a dermatologist! I remember when I freaked about a growing dark mole and was certain I am dying and it turned out to be an ingrown hair. Bad lumps usually take a long time to grow.Skincare is a weird thing for me  the less I do with my face the better it is. As soon as I start a proper skincare moisturizer cleanser toner serums etc. wishin a month or so I start to break out and get all kinds of issues. So it still could be acne scaring even if you did everything well.In the meantime going through these modules usually helps me. I am still battling my anxiety especially now when I have trigeminal nerve issues but this module was the first real stepping stone for me to realize why I have health anxiety and why it feels so real and is so hard to fight.

Ive discussed this with about  different specialists who all have no idea whats going on with me and arent that concerned. GI gyno and PCP. Its exhausting because Ive been fighting to be heard for years. Im out of ideas and no one can help me get rid of my pain. If it went away thatd be so wonderful.

Symptoms include dizziness lightheadedness visual oddities like depth perception problems and other things. Its very annoying and frustrating but it seems to go away on its own after a few weeks. I saw my doctor about it last time this happened a few months ago. He said we could run a bunch of expensive tests but he thought that would be in his words foolhardy.
