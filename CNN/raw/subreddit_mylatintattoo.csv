2436377,0,t3_2ndjhh,Most simply fortunam adiuva can also be spelled adjuva or adiuvateadjuvate which addresses the command to a group of people instead of one at a time. This is simply turning around the old saying you cite. Slightly problematic though because fortune favours is a slightly odd translation that is really mostly meant to be alliterative. Originally the quote means favours in the sense of helps so adiuva means help fortune bring aid to fortune.You could go with favefavete to make it make more sense as it would mean show favour to indulge rather than help but then it would be less connected with the original.Fortuna unfortunately does not purely mean chance it can also have a sense of prosperity as with the English word fortune. The word that means chance with less of an attachment to wealth is itself highly problematic because fortem can also mean strong a strong man a pun which the original Latin version of this quote from Terence relied on fortes Fortuna adiuvat  Fortune favours the strong. If you went with fortem adiuva then it would really most naturally mean help a strong man which you dont likely want.If you want to preserve the sense of the Latin saying this is going to be problematic however you go about it.,mylatintattoo,cmcubjr,3,t5_2ym04

3006446,0,t1_co9m0k1,periculo is singular periculis is plural.In Latin periculum carried the sense of risk or danger in the sense of uncertain but bad outcome.  Not without danger is a fair translation of either singular or plural I think but non sine periculo is the more literal translation back from English.That said howd I do at guessing?,mylatintattoo,co9m6pw,2,t5_2ym04

7024999,0,t1_d1btmix,I like your translation but I would suggest a couple changes. I think sola should instead modify telum as solum so that it comes out as the only weapon. I also think it would flow in Latin better if you moved in bello contra veritatem to the beginning thusIn bello contra veritatem imaginatio est telum solum,mylatintattoo,d1cmwtu,2,t5_2ym04
8126940,0,t3_4qjhxd,That means I am a man of fortune to seek fortune. A better translation would be vir fortunae sum et mihi est quaerenda mea fortuna I am a man of fortune and I must seek my fortune lit. my fortune is to be sought by me.Perhaps this can be finetuned by someone else.,mylatintattoo,d4tjia2,2,t5_2ym04
