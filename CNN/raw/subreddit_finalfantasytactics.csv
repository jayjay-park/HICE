913070,0,t1_ch6n2xz,I did try it out myself but the results were vague. I had two wizards with the Wizard Rod and one with the Lightning Rod. The one with the Lightning Rod did more than one and less than the otherAll three had the same level MA items bar the Rods faith abilities and cast the same spell on the same enemy. Considering this is my th or th playthrough of the game you would think Id know how these thing work but alas... sigh ,finalfantasytactics,ch82ln0,1,t5_2w6ny
1135229,0,t1_cgtx4le,I dont really understand the complaints Ive heard about Vaan as the main character given that hes really not its an ensemble cast with different but overlapping goals taking the lead at different points. Maybe I dont identify with Vaan but I also dont feel the need to. Theres plenty else going on!,finalfantasytactics,chxbnff,1,t5_2w6ny

7971208,0,t1_d4c0vtu,Hey again!  Yes thanks for the initial suggestion and I have indeed been using a Jumping Thief on your suggestion! Ive just been thinking something along the lines above recently i.e. that a Jumping Ninja might actually be even better for much of these reasons than a Jumping Thief despite not being able to make use of the Two Swords ability...especially since I dont really use much in the way of Steal abilities anyway so I might as well have the little bit of throwing ability for mopping up...,finalfantasytactics,d4c1f2x,1,t5_2w6ny

10479944,0,t3_5q090k,I played FFT when it came out for Playstation in .  That was my thth grade year.  I played the hell out of that game and loved every second of it.  When FFTAdvanced came out I was a freshmen in college.  It was cool to return to the world of Ivalice but I felt the frustration that you did.  FFTA was NOT the same world with the same sense of urgency and realism that FFT had.  It wasnt a bad game but it wasnt what I was expecting and made me frustrated that they gave it the FFT title.I downloaded FFT War of the Lion for my android last year and its what I wanted.  So glad I can return to this game.,finalfantasytactics,dcw0da1,3,t5_2w6ny

10717834,0,t3_5tax5j,. Any mage type class will have a good magic attack power that applies to the strength of healing spells as well.  spell power and chance to affect a target is also based on the caster AND targets Faith score.  More faith  More magic  Black mage and Summoner are the easiesthigh damage casters Dragoons and geomancers have good range too.  Ninja and thief have the best movement but applying various movement skills can make any class good. teleport is really useful. cure spells shouldnt miss like that some have a miss chance that is based on your faith level.  use high faith characters as you casters.. there is no skill tree its all available with a point buy.  as you use a class you earn JP points that can be spent on spells and abilities.  you could buy a few low level skills or save up points for the strongest skill.  you can eventually lean them all if you keep using that class.Bonus as you play with the ninja you can buy the Dual swords ability that can be used by any class.  you can have your white mage dual wield staves if you like.,finalfantasytactics,ddlgr6q,3,t5_2w6ny
10772065,0,t1_ddqrrb5,The law system was stupid and arbitrary.  That should just be scrapped. It also was incredibly immersion breaking for what could otherwise feel like meaningful battles. World chariot as another tweak. Steal what tactics ogre did and let me redrop at any point of the game with the squad I have. Gives more replay ability than just stopping before the final mission. And on that note persistent end game. Something to do with your super jacked characters that provides a challenge,finalfantasytactics,ddr25ku,6,t5_2w6ny

11781495,0,t1_dgv8k8g,Thats why scout runs are important. You can see the enemies starting position compared to yours. Them you get to check the gear and stats to form a team able to exploit the weakness that a team has. I still think that there is a lot of tactics that would work in a fight. If your strategy is only based on some  abilities hitting then there is probably a better strategy. I totally respect your view though because we all play the games and mods for different reasons. ,finalfantasytactics,dgvgxwt,1,t5_2w6ny
