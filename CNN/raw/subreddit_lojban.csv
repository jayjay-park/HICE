1781459,0,t1_ck3ompi,Oh sure. Its an easy one.You probably already know ko is the imperative form of do when you want to asktell someone to do something and catra is the gismu for when something kills something x kills x. So you put ko in x AND x slots of catra and you get ko catra ko gt kill yourself.The cool bit is you can choose where to put the selbri as long as the arguments remain in order. So ko dunda ti mi pass me that thing is the classical construction of the bridi but ko ti mi dunda is identical in meaning. So we can take the slightly clinical ko catra ko and make the slightly splicier ko ko catra but they mean the same.Its beautifully concise as an insult and I really enjoy the second form. I feel like theres a subtle significance in the decision to choose the alternate construction for poetic or rhythmic purposes in some remote way analogous to the decision to involve curse words or not.,lojban,ck3pglr,4,t5_2qhk9

2982241,0,t1_co72enc,gt Secondly more obscure languages have less documentation and more difficult sounds.Surely the six languages the gismu names are drawn from also have difficult sounds. Arabic and Chinese have particularly strong reputations for it but every one has at least a few sounds that are likely enough not to exist in some particular language. Of course lojbans strategy would work just as well for any language just use the nearest sound.          dont exist in lojban but they made do.However Im skeptical about the supposed IE bias in the gismu. As far as I know those six languages were used solely for making the gismu mnemonic and their actual meanings were established otherwise. By speakers of an IE language but considering even lojbanists who speak IndoEuropean languages constantly find theres no word for a concept they need Im skeptical that an IE worldview has been successfully encoded in the gismu.,lojban,co73hk5,2,t5_2qhk9

6913647,0,t1_d0zus32,Right but vinji and karce are both things that gets somethingsomeone from a to b so in an abstract language they would be the same word or part of the same word f.exwu something that transports something from a to bThis could be a car a motorcycle an airplane a boat human hand moving the toothbrush from the bedroom to the toilet or maybe a telephone transmission line transmitting electrical signals. ,lojban,d0zzfbj,1,t5_2qhk9
9213886,0,t3_56ji6n,Lojbans pronunciation is very similar to that of continental European languages. English is unusual in this regard because of the Great Vowel Shift. Lojban also has a lot of consonant clusters  its actually a rule for the most common class of word gismu  and unusual consonant clusters often feel Slavic to English speakers. So I can definitely see the resemblance.,lojban,d8jxfq9,5,t5_2qhk9

Thats not a reason NOT to do anything.gt Finally there are important parts of the language that would be difficult to fully convey in a Duolingostyle course.This Memrise course is trying to teach the basics without explaining grammar ,lojban,dbv1jyk,4,t5_2qhk9
