2860794,0,t1_cnt643p,A lot of MSPI babies are fine with soy oil and soy lecithin.  They arent supposed to have the proteins in them which is usually the problem.  If youre not having a problem dont worry about the oil.,mspimommas,cnt9uzr,1,t5_35thy
3282146,0,t3_2xpsfb,It depends on your kid but chances are that it isnt safe. The protein is extremely similar to cows milk.  Does your child have a problem with soy as well? Goats milk protein is more similar to cows than soy.  We make pizza all the time. We put LOTS of toppings on but no cheese. Its surprisingly good and I dont miss the cheese that much. Its not the same obviously but it still kills the craving. ,mspimommas,cp2e3v9,1,t5_35thy

3516536,0,t1_cps44ia,The weight issues make it extra hard emotionally. Everyone thinks it is unrelated but I just feel like its a flashing neon sign saying SOME THINGS WRONG. Plus people always make comments about it after they ask how old she is. Its frustrating and upsetting and makes me defensive. The mucus in her poop is way less and she doesnt scream when she facts or poops anymore.  ,mspimommas,cpt40e0,1,t5_35thy

I pretty much wonder every day if he truly has it or not. ,mspimommas,cqu1d1s,1,t5_35thy
