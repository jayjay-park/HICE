1029974,0,t1_chl0b5q,Average Chub is about  bucks roughly or was when I built mine  years ago more for harder to get colors. Even if he got them down as low as  bucks  Doing limited but still custom color palettes still means its more than knocking them all out in one color. Id say at  for  hes cutting it pretty close to free already. Good on him for doing it that low. Hopefully brings more players in. Bricklink Brickowl and PAB can all be pains in the ass to deal with and circumventing that for a reasonable price is hopefully attractive enough. Ive personally assembled a few full Garage Kits for players myself it was about  hours each time with customization and then compromises based on availability.  I assumed it was  for  because I dont think  is out of the question and the pic shows .   ordering assembling the parts bagging and shipping is time consuming. ,MFZ,chld3m3,2,t5_2tvpk

1160665,0,t1_ci05dzx,I thought about the violent material thing but thats a bit bogus in terms of an excuse since they make stuff like star wars which is almost exclusively weaponized vehicles and violent characters. Not to mention bionicle exo force and tons of other sites which were also largely based around violent conflict. I definitely think if lego did want to formerly adopt something like MFZ they would probably extremely simplify the back story to appeal to  year olds more which is a little sad to me because as a kid who grew up on gundam Ive never minded complex sociopolitical plots with my giant robots.,MFZ,ci06yl3,4,t5_2tvpk

1805614,0,t1_ck5kvhe,Changed some colors and blew it up in LDD so you can see the parts a little easierHipsThe Travis brick is stuck into the x technic brick. Theres a jumper between them but I deleted it to improve visibility and stuff.Backpack and shouldersTheres a x plate between the two lamp holders in the backpack that helps keep it from being too wiggly. I used a standard turntable base not a magnet clip but couldnt find the standard base in LDD. The arms are pretty straightforward but if you need instructions theyre lifted pretty much straight off of Sorens Chub frame Rainbow leg!,MFZ,ck6qqm9,1,t5_2tvpk
