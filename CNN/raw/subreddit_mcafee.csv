5476967,0,t3_3q0u3k,I havent used the AV agent on a stand alone desktop for a while but chances are its scheduled to do a full system scan on a regular basis.  This is a good thing that you want to happen regularly but of course not while youre actively using it.Somewhere within the agent theres likely a schedule for this.  Adjust it so its no happening when youre typically going to be using the system but realize if the system is turned off or asleep when it runs its likely going to try and run the next time the system boots up.,mcafee,cwbqfef,1,t5_2sfg8
