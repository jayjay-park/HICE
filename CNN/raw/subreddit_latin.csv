326054,0,t1_cfeinia,Youre right we can never know for sure.  But historical linguists can piece together the rules of Classical Latin phonetics based on many types of evidence.  Allens Vox Latina gives these examples. Direct statements by grammarians and other authors.. Plays on words and imitations of natural sounds.. The representation of Latin words in other languages.. Developments in Romance languages.. Spelling conventions and misspellings.. The structure of Latin e.g. metrical patterns.In the face of these facts historical linguists can do more than simply assume that Latin was pronounced just like modern Italian which by the way is a fallacyif it were true wed still be pronouncing house to rhyme with goose as they did in Old and Middle English.  Regarding the issue of long vs. short E the main evidence is in the evolution of the word in the Romance languages.  Consider these changes mel Lat. becomes miel Fr. miele It. and miel Sp. vrum Lat. becomes voire Fr. vero It. and vero Sp. pira Lat. becomes poire Fr. pera It. and pera Sp. vvere Lat. becomes vivre Fr. vivere It. and viver Sp.Based on the fact that long  and short i merged into the same vowel in Romance derivatives historical linguists argue that  and i were more similar than either of them were with e or .  Looking at this chart we can see how close e and  are so thats where linguists are coming to this conclusion.,latin,cfeke06,4,t5_2qloa

707195,0,t1_cgkgvp8,Thanks for the reply.  I agree with you in saying that most people think their Latin is better than it really is I for one have recently fallen into this trap so no offense taken but I also think this is a product of the language spanning so much time.  It is one thing to grow comfortable with say Cicero and another to get used to the writings and stylings of Suetonius.  Just because you can truly read Cicero does not necessarily mean you can truly read through Suetonius at the drop of a hat. I purchased the first Lingua Latina book as a sort of primer before grad school I took about  years away from Latin but didnt get through much of it due to a lack of discipline and that false superiority that comes with reading the first few chapters.  I will definitely pick that back up once Ive finished my term papers and go from there.  ,latin,cgkntm4,1,t5_2qloa

1322162,0,t3_296sck,I actually find myself agreeing with most of his points taking issue only with  strongly  and to a lesser degree .I think he touches on an extremely important point withgt It can be argued that learning Latin grammar is simply misleading as there is no real transfer to the target languages certainly not EnglishThe fact that we believe Latin grammar to be applicable to English at all is imho mostly due to us viewing English from an inherently diachronic point of view.If one were to approach English without any knowledge of its history one would probably arrive at a quite different description of its grammar than that which is taught today.          Even fundamentals like the lexical distinction between verb and noun might be shaken in the acknowledgement of English as an isolating language the fact that an English word can act as both verb and noun  to read a read to run a run to drink a drink ...  is arguably common enough to treat the cases in which this is not possible as exceptions and the few traces of a case system e.g. personal pronouns the few traces of inflection e.g. brother  brethren ... would finally be relegated to the footnotes they deserve.But instead of viewing English synchronically we look at it in the context of what it once was and spend remarkable effort on shoehorning it into a grammatical system that might have been applicable to Old English but which turns the most common rules into exceptions and turns the rarest exceptions into rules when applied to modern English.My impression is that using the grammatical categories and terms of Latin only clouds ones view on English. English is not like most IndoEuropean languages anymore its vocabulary and history only serve to fool us.I might be exaggerating a bit and English might still have another few centuries in it before it really can be called an isolating language  but the trend is clear and my basic argument stands.,latin,ciicz56,2,t5_2qloa

1346296,0,t3_29hum9,I am quite active on this subreddit despite English not being my native language  not quite a college level Latin course but I think still comparable in some aspects.For me the biggest difference is that in my native language German I have memorized standard translations for most Latin words. These translations are not always the best and sometimes they are quite archaic but they were chosen by previous generations of Latin teachers to create the best possible match in grammar between Latin text and German translation or vice versa.         E.g. adiuvare and adesse can both be translated with to help but in German I have memorized untersttzen to support for adiuvare and helfen to help for adesse simply because untersttzen commands the accusative and helfen commands the dative.      I would always translate the phrase tui memini with the slightly archaic Ich erinnere mich Deiner into German rather than use the much more common Ich erinnere mich an Dich  because the former features the genitive deiner whereas the latter has acc.  preposition an dich.        And if I had to translate tui memor Id leave the realm of contemporary German entirely and translate as Deiner eingedenk because this allows me to retain the genitive and translate memor as a single word which seems impossible to achieve in colloquial German.As I have never learned English meanings for Latin words I spend more time thinking about how to express the meaning of a Latin sentence when translating into English compared to falling back on memorized phrases. This certainly leads to better translations on average but at the same time I sometimes find myself at a complete loss regarding how to translate into English in a way that makes the grammar of the Latin sentence transparent to the reader of my English translation.            On this subreddit this is usually not a big deal but in exams you dont translate to produce a literary translation but to demonstrate your understanding of the Latin text and its grammar. Eloquence and the exactness with which the meaning of the Latin text is rendered into your target language take a backseat to the need to make your understanding of Latin and your thought process during translation visible to your professor. And that is hard in languages other than the one you learned Latin in.        The standard translations and their grammatical closeness to Latin also play a big role in translations from German to Latin  the professor can easily regulate the difficulty of any such translation exercise by varying the degree of grammatical proximity between the German text and the desired Latin translation.      If he writes Ich erinnere mich an Dich he will probably get a bunch of ad te memini answers if he writes Ich erinnere mich Deiner the translation exercise will yield much better scores despite both variants being fully equivalent in meaning.                But if you have never memorized the standard translations of Latin expressions into German or French because it is not the language you originally learned Latin in then such aids might be lost on you.,latin,cil2ojm,14,t5_2qloa

1443556,0,t1_cix706j,no we also have the vast amount of poetry written in latin to glean information fromlatin poetry was written in meter and thus each line conforms to a certain pattern of long and short vowels. by scanning the lines we easily find out whether a vowel was pronounced long or short. alternatively we can also look at other languages like ancient greek and sanskrit or just protoindoeuropean to see if the latin version of the word would likely have a long vowel or we can look at a words descendants in the romance languages for evidence of a vowel being long or short. even without things like finding evidence in inscriptions whether it be in the writing of those double vowels mentioned above by nomensinenomine or the marks that are sometimes seen written on long vowels and poetry or using other languages to reconstruct latin there is one huge indication that the latin language possessed long vowels the Romans themselves have told us!

Motivation one of the primary indicators of whether a second language learner will succeed i.e. reach a competent standard is entirely extralinguistic. Do they have sufficiently strong external or internal motivators that mean they need to learn the language?

They literally take it apart wordbyword so you can see how the translation works.Of course often to read that English is almost gibberish or highly cumbersome and archaic but its still comprehensible.  The era of most of the translations also adds to the archaism but I dont mind that. Examplegt In at the same time these charges were broughtback to Caesar and ambassadors did come from the Aedui and Treviri the Aedui came to complain that the Harudes who lately had been carriedover into Gaul did laywaste the borders of them themselves to have beenable to purchase peace of Avriovistus not indeed even hostages being given.Most interlinears are on the Hamiltonian system where they adjust the Latin word order so you can read the English coherently.

3423117,0,t3_2zdgdx,I dont know if this is of any help to you but your question got me curious about the translation of the passage in Portuguese and Spanish so I looked it up.In Portuguese my native language malum is almost exclusively translated as o mal meaning the evil an article and a substantive.The words malummalus evolved in Portuguese and are written mal when used as an adverb or substantive or mau when as an adjective.Theres a interesting particularity of the inclusion of the article o  idiomatically here it gives it a broad meaning that also includes moral evil.I dont know if or how that would apply to Latin since it lacks articles but if I were to translate the passage from Portuguese to English Id emphasise likeand create all that is evil or all the evil instead of just and create evil because like you said it might suggest evil things or create the evil because I suppose it might suggest the evil beingsevents.Spanish translations however are surprisingly diverse. They use words like calamidades calamities and adversidad adversity which I believe is a clear attempt to distance it from the meaning of moral evil.,latin,cpigl7v,2,t5_2qloa

3879241,0,t3_34s2op,So... I learned  in that order and I learned to decline NGDAcAbV. Since then Ive taught using a number of different methods including rbergs which still goes  but orders the cases NAcGDAb and omits the vocative except for nd decl. masc. nouns in us. I much prefer this order since it puts similar endings near each other and makes many of the declensions look far less daunting than they appear with other orders. I also just like the visual poetics of having the stem form in the middle like a stem on a leaf. Having done a lot of research on how we actually learn languages Im thoroughly convinced that every textbook and teaching method Ive seen screws this whole thing up. Instead of focusing on teaching declensions and cases as if they were in themselves useful for anything more than talking about the language what we should be focusing on is teaching grammatical function without tying ourselves down to any given declension at a time. We should furthermore be teaching these functions in order of the frequency with which they occur in Latin texts with the exception being given to the subjectnominative and objectaccusative functions which should be the first functions introduced regardless of frequency simply because its the easiest place to start. We should introduce all nominatives simultaneously first singular forms then plural forms and only after theyve all been internalized should we add in accusatives in the same manner. From there we should build out but instead of teaching students to recognize endings as part of a pattern of sounds we should be teaching them to recognize them as part of a pattern of inherent meaning. The only way we can reasonably do that is by giving them ALL the declensions at once but doing so slowly case by case.,latin,cqygty1,4,t5_2qloa

4173516,0,t1_crvybd5,This is in a nut shell my hope and the contents of a letter I sent to the SCS a few months ago. From a numbersanalysis side I think the reality is that Classics just isnt viewed as an economically viable degree currently especially in light of the recent recession the focus on STEM fields and the general standard American bent toward immediate utilitarianism. Im not sure that any amount of reform can make the argument that Classics is immediately useful to a particular vocation but I think that with the right adjustments we can at least make pursuing these subjects seem like a valuable use of ones time generally.Youre totally right that the very crux of the issue rests in our speaking of the field outdated pedagogy models and assumptions. Regardless of our goals Is the point to just read Latin? Is the point to speak it too? etc. the nails are being hammered into our coffin as we find out more and more that achieving any of those goals efficiently will largely be dependent on current models and methodologies that we simply refuse to addressemploy. Comprehensible Input is at this juncture the basis of theory in SLA and we do nothing with it in our programs. The consequence is as you note that our students simply arent developed enough with the languages to do anything at all at a worthwhile level.The only other thing that Id mention is that I think we need to consider our teaching and pedagogy beyond the simple demands of SLA and the more technical aspects of the language. I think one of the relevancy issues for the Classics is that weve been reading the same damn stuff for millennia and that the corpus we engage with represents about . of . of extant Latin sources. We need to start engaging the entire tradition if we want to generate truly novel philological works and escape the mire that has become Critical Theory in Classics  you know where we beat dead horses that weve dressed up to look different from the times we beat them previously.  ,latin,crvzko8,3,t5_2qloa

Now you could make the argument that verb conjugation is one of the easiest things in Latin and you would be right but Spanish is extremely regular as well and they use the pronouns to identify as well.This is stupid and weak pedagologically.

5687227,0,t3_3sz7fh,I would tend to say that generally English is better for expressing abstract thought in modern terms because of certain advantages it enjoys such asmuch larger vocabularyarticlesmore verb tenses andreliance on prepositions allowing for disambiguation in some situations.A comparison between any two languages however will reveal areas where each of them has what seems like almost a fatal flaw from the perspective of the other when it comes to communicating within a certain ambit. For example Latin allows for esse and ens as being a crucial metaphysical distinction. On the other hand Latin is ambiguous from the perspective of English on fieri  being made becoming coming to be happening.Also lets not forget that languages are extensible and the expression of abstract ideas is frequently accomplished by following a languages morphology and coining new words.

5802710,0,t3_3uj6ym,Your conjecture is correct namely that when two identical vowels appear side by side they are to be analyzed into different syllables.There are cases where two identical vowels side by side could merge into one syllable by crasis which as far as I know only happens to i. However when this happens the resulting word is always written with just one i. An example is d pl. nom. of deus where the irregular form di undergoes crasis. Likewise Il gen. sing. of Ilius. In fact  in the genitive regularly results from names in ius.Note that for a time in Latin and possibly more often in other Italic languages a long vowel was marked by duplication aara for ra. Hence one may safely assume that if two identical vowels stand side by side they must be analyzed into separate syllables for otherwise one would just obtain a long syllable by analogy to the albeit not widely used double vowel marking.,latin,cxgdqfu,1,t5_2qloa

6504194,0,t1_czrvph6,Youve already gotten two good responses above but I will just throw one more piece of telling evidence into the discussion tooIf it were the ablative that had survived we would expect rd declension neuter nouns to retain the full shape of their classical stems which are often obscured in the nominative singular and for neuter nouns the accusative singular but fully visible in the ablative. So for instances corpus corporis might have arrived in modern Italian as corpore or in Spanish as cuerpor tempus temporis in Italian as tempore Spanish tiempor caput capitis in Italian as capite Spanish cabite etc.Instead we get forms of these words now of masculine gender that reflect the expected sound changes from the nominativeaccusative singular i.e. the erosion of the final consonant short and unaccented u becoming o etc. Italian corpo Spanish cuerpo and cf. French corps which still shows the now phonologically inert s It. tempo Sp. tiempo Fr. temps It. capo Sp. cabo which no longer means head and so forth.I should note though that this reasoning does NOT hold true for genus generis which kept the r from the oblique stem in all of the daughters though it has since dropped out in Romanian. So It. genere Sp.Pt. gnero Fr. genre. Im not sure why this happened. Possibly influence from the neuter plural genera? Or maybe genus began to be analyzed as the nominative of a masculine rd declension noun with a hypothetical accusative in generem from which the modern forms would naturally derive. I dont know.,latin,czs2ze5,1,t5_2qloa

6891407,0,t1_d0xcuzr,It really is unclear when U started being pronounced V from historical linguistics. Eventually it happenedat least by  AD the change was probably gradual over time. UW as a sound is much common than V as a sound in languages so it is not necessarily surprising the Romans didnt use it and it developed. However to be clear I am a bit skeptical this really counts as Vulgar Latin. It is more like.. Simplified Late Latin with different pronunciation patterns than what we think Latin was spoken in the Classical period. Now to be clear Vulgar didnt exist as a language it was continuum of dialects of Classical Latin and as such is a mere construction. It would be impossible to make a true dialect of Vulgar Latin because you would need so much evidence and even then it would really only from the part of the world you collected evidence from. ,latin,d0xgizm,3,t5_2qloa
6912986,0,t3_4adtuk,noli trepidare!First did you really not do any verseprose analysis at GCSE? If so thats probably going to be the hardest area for you. The main thing is to both know a good fairly literal translation and have the ability to translate it off the top of your head.  lines sounds like a lot but its not if you spend time studying it with a translation. It helps that the assigned texts are pretty memorable.For the actual exam questions the hardest are the mark literary analysis ones. They arent too bad just quote some of the Latin translate it and say what it does in the passage referring to what the question actually says. Some of your points must be style rather than content e.g. particularly colourful vocabulary metaphorssimiles chiasmus emphatic positioning etc.As far as the language element goes its not that much harder than GCSE. Theres quite a lot more vocabulary but no hideously complex new grammar. Just get a textbook I think John Taylors is fairly standard and go through it. The EnglishgtLatin is probably going to be easier than the unseen Cicero translation. Its very generously marked and usually not too advanced. Good luck!,latin,d0zwppm,2,t5_2qloa

In each chapter there is a passage usually of  pages that introduces one or more new grammatical concepts. By reading the passage a student can begin to pick up on the concept by way of induction. After the passage there is an explicit Latin explanation of the new concepts from the chapter.I have found LLPSI to be a very effective and helpful resource for improving my ability to read Latin and assuming that your goal is being able to use the language well I think you would find it very helpful too.,latin,d14c3zn,3,t5_2qloa

Theres a massive difference between speaking with an accent and totally making up your own pronunciation.

I remember we barely learned the indicative form of verbs not even all five declensions we never could have spent extra time on pronunciation!Of course some pronunciations dont work like your aquay example but these are so few and far between that its hardly a problem.

9424812,0,t3_59pxa7,I have studied under Reggie in Milwaukee but not as a beginner so I dont really know how he teaches the rudiments. The classes mostly involved taking turns reading and rendering into English passages from what I want to call a booklet but which shared almost the dimensions of a pillow except in thickness. These passages were divided into six sections classical prose church fathers and middle ages ecclesiastical and renaissance recent and the art of writing colloquial and methods of teaching poetry but seemingly chosen without forethought. Constant use was made of Lewis and Shorts dictionary which we each needed to have a copy of and quite regular reference also to Gildersleeves grammar.In addition to the readings there were other activities. Sometimes Reggie would bring in a magazine and we would translate the advertisements or other parts sometimes he would get a call from Italy and would ask for our suggestions for composing the popes Latin tweet. There were several outings each with its own set of readings. There was certainly an emphasis in all on the art and architecture of a Latin sentence and in our class also on the art of teaching.Our ludi domestici typically consisted of a small passage of Latin about which several superfosterian questions would be asked usually focused on ambiguities of forms and other possible confusions followed by a  request to render the passage in English. There was also a section of English prose to be put into elegant Latin. You can get just the merest little taste of one here if you zoom in and squint None of this gets across how fun and completely engrossing the classes were! Reggie himself is always funny and very humane and warm despite a sometimes gruff exterior. Happily some sense of this does come across in the book at least in what Ive read so far.I received my copy just yesterday. Im really excited to go through it! You will notice that occasionally he says something like at this point the teacher will bring out reading sheets or will produce examples so it is certainly designed to be used in a class along with a teacher following Reggies method. I hope there are such teachers out there! You may also notice that the readings in the book are chosen completely at random and that no attempt has been made to collect easier texts for the earlier experiences  another indication that this is unlikely to work for the autodidact at least without recourse to other books and methods. For those of us a bit further along it looks like a real treasure and its really wonderful to have so much of Reggies insight and so much of his voice captured at last for posterity.

10939454,0,t3_5w10tn,Here do you want a translation of the phrase?chirotheca manum saepe celat sordidam albacaestu isnt quite right since its a boxing glove type thing whereas chirotheca is more of an apparel thing from what I can tell.The chirotheca alba was taken thanks to LookAFox! EcceVulpes. Also I decided to put chirotheca and alba on the ends of the phrase so that they structurally encapsulate manum and sordidum  my thinking is that its quite apt that the white glove both grammatically and structurally covers up the dirty hand. Plus I put manus with chirotheca and sordidum with alba to emphasise that the glove covers the hand and the white covers the dirty.,latin,de8bt9p,1,t5_2qloa

Also might want to start by spellchecking yourself. You got some funny forms like avimi where I think you mean asti or avisti. Also you need to review how to construct impersonal gerundive phrases te puniendum est is incorrect ... and how to construct purpose clauses ut paterum occidire is incorrect  also check the ending you have for the verb there...Also review your rd declension nouns.. I think you mean patrem not paterum when I first read that I thought you got the gender wrong for patera  which is a libation bowl...,latin,dg706ky,7,t5_2qloa

11585869,0,t3_659sqg,As with all studying Im afraid nobody can really help you to motivate yourself to sit down for  hours a day and study its something you have to do for yourself. The first thing you need to do is realise that learning Latin is not a list of facts you need to remember and videos you need to watch its a language so you may be overcomplicating things for yourself.Secondly it seems your psychological state is  of the problem here so thats what you need to fix. I think you need to stop relying on tutors and teachers since its obvious they are doing more harm than good. You need to find a way to relax and approach your studies with a clear and calm head so whatever calms you down and relaxes you do that before you study. Do it in small chunks e.g. memorising  or  words at a time and alternate between different methods rather than just powering through one task. And also make sure youre getting enough sleep and food and stay well hydrated because small things like that can often be enough to push you from Latin is a pointless language and I hate it and am going to fail to maybe Ill just do  minutes more and at least have some chance at passing the test.I studied Latin for  years and I never got to a point where I liked the language some of the most frustrating times in my life have been spending hours studying grammar and vocab only to attempt a translation and end up nearly crying at how little I could understand. Latin can be an incredibly intimidating language because things like word order and the very small vocabulary of the language can make it seem impossible to fit together the different parts of a sentence even if you theoretically know all of the words in it. The best things to do are to go right back to the beginning of the textbook and work your way through the bits you do understand and stop as soon as you get to something you dont and do everything possible to fill in the hole in your knowledge. Also if something is clearly very difficult then leave it and come back to it later do the bits which are easiest and then build on those. That way you wont feel so much like you dont know what is missing in your knowledge. As a language teacher myself English for nonEnglish speakers I can confirm that your Latin teacher is not very mature and probably shouldnt be a teacher I have had students who have barely learned a word of English over the course of several months of living in England. But the way to approach that is not to sardonically criticise and give up on people. The beauty of language is that theres no language in human history that cant be learned by a  year old child to a reasonable standard because all languages are naturally learned by children so theres nobody who cant learn a language. Its just a matter of staying positive and making it easy for yourself and having a bit of acceptance that failure in the short term is acceptable and doesnt necessarily mean that perseverance wont produce positive results. ,latin,dg99kfr,1,t5_2qloa
11617047,0,t3_65rylp,She may have been thought that because over the years its become a common joke that there is no word for yes among our Latin classes so maybe something similar has happened over there.
