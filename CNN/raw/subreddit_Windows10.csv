2071102,0,t1_cl32eh5,Awesome point friend! Youre right nobody wants to use voice to search on their PC. Thats why Cortana is right for the job and not Google Now or Siri.As many know Cortana on Windows Phone can be commanded by voice or by typing whatever command question or search term you want as you would speak it. Interestingly the majority of people search Google the exact same way  by typing their question the same way they would speak it.Now imagine. You dont have to open a browser. You dont have to open a new tab. You click this handy button or use a keyboard shortcut to open up Cortana. She greets you with a bounce. You type in your query  How tall is John Cena? How big is New York City? Define Contiguous. Or what have you. Instead of getting a list of web pages youre greeted with the answer. Right there plain and simple. Then you dismiss Cortana and go about what youre doing.How gloriously simple and nonintrusive.But wait you say. Google searches can give you the answer at the top of the page sometimes too! Well good on you you exist in  as well! You bet it does but the organization of keeping your searches in one easytoaccess place no matter what youre doing seems quite valuable to me.The thing that youre forgetting about is the main reason Cortana is a fantastic feature in the first place and more than just a simple ripoff of Siri. I am not one for talking to my phone and Id be even less to with my PC. But Cortana makes queries and searches a lot easier even if I input my request in a similar way to how I would otherwise.,Windows10,cl32zff,0,t5_2u9xs

2373180,0,t1_cm48c3c,gt USB OR PS?gt gt The Gv is built with a USB as standard but we also included a USB to PS adapter in the box. The choice is yours.gt gt We absolutely recommend using the PS connector when possible. Firstit will give you total freedom with no limit to the amount of simultaneous key presses. And equally as important using the PS may just improve your overall gaming experience. The reason is that when you use a USB keyboard your computer is actually using CPU time polling your keyboard. The higher the polling rate the more CPU time is used to perform the polling. And because of the builtin debounce rate found on any quality keyboard any polling rate above Hz is simply a waste of CPU time and really just a result of pointless marketing hype. Unlike USB keyboards a PS keyboard isnt polled at all. The keyboard simply sends a signal to the computer as key presses are made which causes a hardware interrupt forcing the CPU to register the signal.  ,Windows10,cm5173c,1,t5_2u9xs

There is good reason why theyre replacing the Control Panel with the Settings application and Im sure theyll eventually do the same with the other components to the point that all the components of Windows scale out of the box with only third party applications left requiring updating.

2889750,0,t1_cnwhowg,gtThis means that a Windows  license is tied to a device tighter than ever!Possibly. For most consumers there is no difference  Windows comes preinstalled and they never think about upgrades. For business users it means nothing. That means no change for  of users.gtwill most likely have to buy a new device within the year after the release of Windows  or roll back to the earlier version.Thats a crazy assumption. The main reason Microsoft is giving away free upgrades is to get as many people as possible on the latest version of Windows to increase developer reach simplify security and updates and so on. Its not about tricking users into a forced upgrade later. They dont want people on Windows   or . once Windows  is released.gtMany consumer products supported lifetime is around one maybe two years.Youre assuming that will be updated for the supported life is equal to will stop working at the end of the devices supported life.I think a more realistic assumption would be that certain updates will not be delivered to unsupported devices e.g. OS feature updates rather than security updates. How for example would Microsoft determine that my homebuilt PC is supported? Why would they court a PR nightmare by forcibly downgrading PC OSes?gtSo what choice do you have? I only see a subscription model to have Windows  on nonsupported or endoflife devices.No. Microsoft have more to gain by keeping users on Windows  buying apps using other MS services. And there is no feasible way of determining when a device is no longer supported.Youre basically assuming the absolute worstcase scenarios here and none of them makes any real sense given the available information and a bit of common sense.

They said that the features talked about yesterday will gradually be added to the tech preview builds over the next several months.gtwill there not be a consumer preview at all ?They mentioned originally that there would be a consumer preview and a developer preview but I expect they will be milestones in the tech preview timeline not separate. There will probably not be updates to those builds I expect an ISO and minor updates followed by the full release in October.gthave they indicated any changes to the usage agreement There is updated terms but I dont know the details. gtwhether they will still be collecting usage data from people who install Win Absolutely they will.

2922741,0,t3_2tm7rl,the Start menu in previous builds of Windows  was very good. However the latest build is taking some ideas from windows  that I really dont agree with.if I wanted to buy an Android device I would buy an Android device. If I wanted to buy an iPad I would buy an iPad.but lets take a quick look at the difference between my iPad and my PC.  tablet might have five or six applications that I use on a regular basis video web browsing podcasts maybe a couple games. This fits because of the use case of a tablet Im watching videos surfing the web listening to music listening to podcasts or perhaps playing games. By contrast I use my PC for so much more. I used to develop my website I use it to record podcasts I use it to edit audio I used to create videos I use it to program proprietary hardware the list goes on and on and on.not only do I use the PC for PC specific things but I also use it for many of the same tasks that I use my tablet for.so the idea of having a flat or almost flat listing of the programs that I own doesnt appeal to me. for an example of why you need only look at my steam list. I have something along the lines of  games on steam at the moment. My list is completely unmanageable. Its simply one long list of titles white noise. By contrast the tree structure that has been used for the Start menu for a very long time can split different applications into a number of different logical units. Perhaps we could start by sorting things by company then group all of the icons related to a certain application in another group. By splitting things up this way things become way more manageable. Suddenly Im not sitting there with  different icons trying to remember which one I was looking for. the other change which I really disagree with is sorting things by alphabetical order then showing individual letters using space that would take up four or five different programs peclutters everything ironically clutters everything up.instead of seeing  or  programs for some areas of the alphabet Im seeing three or four massive letters and maybe  or  tiny programs.if Microsoft wants to change the way they been doing the Start menu they really need to come up with a new and innovative way of managing large numbers of programs. If they incentivize using fewer programs because it gets too confusing too quickly and then effectively they remove a major benefit of the Windows platform compared to its competitors. If my PC is going to turn into a tablet experience I might as well buy a tablet for a third of the price.wall of text Im dictating this.,Windows10,co0bp3q,8,t5_2u9xs

The ads show a person reading through your mail suggesting that is what Google does. Google doesnt have humans reading your mail. They have computers parse your mail to serve up contextual ads.Microsoft parses your mail for spam. Microsoft used to parse the body of mail for contextual ads but could never get it working correct. They say now they only parse the subject line of your email for ads. But implying that your email isnt private at Google but it is at Microsoft is a dishonest attack ad on another company.The kicker is that the federal government really went after Google for not playing ball more with the domestic spying program and even did maninthemiddle attacks on Google to try and get to emails which Google encrypts and tries to keep away from the government.Their have been rumors that Microsoft gives the government as much access as they want into our email. Whether or not that is true is speculation but the government has been favorable in their treatment of Microsoft and didnt have to try maninthemiddle attacks to get Microsoft email.Google has been pushing for HTTPS everywhere and making HTTPS a core part of HTTP.

If you right click on your desktop and select personalize it will open your settings. On the top left press the back arrow and it will bring you to your settings main menu. Click on Update amp Security and then Recovery and Reset the PC. You will be able to keep your files if you reset. This will reinstall Windows  but you will lose some apps doing so. After you Reset the PC there will be a list on your desktop of the apps that were removed so you can easily reinstall them. Resetting and reinstalling windows  has fixed my problem. I hope this helps people who have similar issuesRun Powershell in admin mode and paste this commandGetAppXPackage AllUsers | Foreach AddAppxPackage DisableDevelopmentMode Register .InstallLocationAppXManifest.xmlThen restart your computer and the apps should work.Are two fixes I have found I havent been able to do either yet as I cant open fucking Powershell and I cant open update and security either. ,Windows10,ctlfg11,2,t5_2u9xs

Only workaround Ive found is to reboot.Because of these issues Im just turning my computer off a lot more or plan to reboot as soon as I plug it inunplug it from the dock.

4741875,0,t1_cts8r99,I agree with you the only thing is that it is misleading to call it Windows  even really it is not a full Windows  experience it only shares a core with Windows  which is not the same. Some of us were excited when they said it was Windows  which would be surprising if they actually did that for the obvious reasons we keep rehashing as cool as it would be but turns out its not what they claimed by the headline that it is actually Windows . A core of a product and the actual product is not the same thing. It would be like calling Windows Server  as Windows  because they share a core or Windows Phone  the same as Xbox One because they will soon also share the same core. Same core with some overlap with Windows Store but still they are different products different capabilities different markets. Windows  on Xbox One is NOT happening despite what they say. They are using the wrong name.It would be like saying Im making a Banana Smoothie Cheesecake but in actual fact the ingredients was never made from any Banana Smoothies only Bananas so really it is just a Banana Cheesecake and nothing to do with Banana Smoothies after all even though they both have Banana.,Windows10,cts9am3,1,t5_2u9xs

Youll be downloading an ISO via a tool provided by Microsoft for this very purpose.gtAnd finally what do you mean by You dont need to wait for the upgrade to be rolled out via Windows Update?Before Windows  was launched MS released an update to Windows  and . users via Windows Updates that placed that get Windows  icon in their system tray which was basically just an advertisement and an attempt to try and get as many people as possible to move from  or . over to Windows . Then when Windows  was released MS started rolling out Windows  via Windows Update to Windows  and Windows . users although this is still ongoing and will probably take a few more weeks before its rolled out to everyone.So all Im saying is you can use the method I linked to in that other post and you dont have to sit back and wait until MS eventually roll the update out to you via Windows Update.I wouldnt post illegal or illegitimate methods of upgrading as A I wouldnt want to screw with other peoples systems and potentially leave them with borked computers B my posts would be deleted by the mods and C I would probably end up banned from this sub lol. ,Windows10,ctveyxr,2,t5_2u9xs
4767207,0,t1_ctvbto7,gt Thats not true. The entire point of universal apps is that they scale across all Windows  systems including desktops which have windows.Scale yes.  But optimized for someone dragging the size back and forth over and over probably not.  For example if youre on a tablet and shift from portrait to landscape thats a single transition rather than multiple transitions of slowing resizing the window.Could it be better?  Sure.  But UAPs arent the only apps that have issues like this.  Try resizing Chrome or IE neither are UAPs like Edge and youll see similar edge painting behavior and UI elements resizing on the fly.  Or try resizing Visual Studio or Outlook.  Even file explorer windows have similar visual artifacts.Truth be told resizing windows like this just isnt something that most people do.  They might resize a window once and then leave it or they might maximize and unmaximize but aside from bored mouse movers the people who randomly click the people who randomly select text the people who randomly spin their cursor in patterns etc most people just arent going to notice or care about some odd graphic artifacts during the act of resizing.,Windows10,ctvg7v2,10,t5_2u9xs

I cant get overly worried about it being on in W.Remember that most of the bad vibes about automatic updates originate one way or another from people who would still find fault with Microsoft even if it suddenly turned out that they were actually God.People who just want to use their computer shouldnt have any problems.

As soon as I delete all of the partitions that Linux has I will no longer be able to boot into Windows however I will still have all of my Windows files in place except for the proper boot loader of course. From your first sentence are you saying that I should choose to install? From the pictures Ive seen online granted only for Windows  and Windows  there is normally a separate option for something along the lines of Repair this Computer which is why I was assuming I wouldnt want to use the install feature. Thanks for the help by the way I really appreciate it!EDIT Apparently the Windows installer does have the repair option. When the installer natively runs at k resolution the window becomes compressed too much and the text actually gets covered up but can still be accessed by hitting the tab key until it doesnt look like it has selected anything and then hitting enter. I ran the  fix I thought was necessary but it looks like I still have the GRUB bootloader.

Addressing the question.gtLets just say Keeping it short.

Again addressing the question by showing my opinion.gtfrom my  PCSaying how this program was affecting something of high value to me.gtbecause it was fucking it upThe program was affecting my PC in a way where it literally made it not work properly. Now...gtand you dont even bother offering up an explanation for it.Did OP ask for an explanation? No. I was responding to my experience as you can see in the first two words. Also refer to the fact I was keeping it short and didnt go into offering an explanation because it would likely be a large wall of text. Something not anyone wouldve read which wouldve probably gathered people like you telling me how it doesnt make sense or its pointless writing that much for such a small issue and you shouldve said you just deleted it... Ect...Its really not hard to misinterpret something were humans and sometimes not everyone thinks the same but when you blatantly avoid the god damn obvious and complain about it youre an idiot.

5355616,0,t1_cvw7dhv,Im not positive. Windows uses something called Effective Pixels epx to scale UI elements consistently regardless of a given devices width and height in physical pixels. Its basically abstracting physical pixels to a neutral unit of measurement so that you can scale comfortably without knowing exactly how many pixels wide or tall you need to make something on different devices. This is why windows and apps keep their proportions when you plug in a new monitor with a different resolution and is why things like Continuum work as well.What Im not sure of is how easy it is to apply that method to animation in Windows. The problem is that you also have to snap to pixels to make sure you dont get weird soft edges on objects. For example if the edge of a square lands at a width of .px youll end up with a weird looking gray line where the half pixel is being simulated.So it is a challenging problem and there is a solution just not sure how well that works in XAML.See Effective PixelsPixel Snapping Example,Windows10,cvw8o5l,3,t5_2u9xs

5648806,0,t1_cwx9qwg,The web app model is that it is too reliant on web developers to design websites that are friendly and usable on a  inch touchscreen and is therefore less preferable on a phone.  For desktop users websites are already designed with a keyboard and mouse in mind much moreso than any apps and the browser is like its own little OS in which you can do pretty much everything.  Switching between tabs for Facebook Twitter News banking music etc. feels like a faster and more efficient workflow than switching between programs that do each of those things.  For power users using that term loosely it also allows you to use keyboard shortcuts to interact with all those things much more quickly than you could if you were in separate apps.I think apps are nice for things that I use full screen and which command my entire focus  namely videos.  For everything else it just feels less efficient because it disrupts the flow of my multitasking.That said if Windows  ends up really nailing the useful and usable notification center and tying it to apps only I could see app use increasing.,Windows10,cwxaf6n,7,t5_2u9xs

The same piece of feedback could be classified one hundred different ways by one hundred different people which makes it nigh on impossible to find and vote for things easily. In turn this makes it difficult for the devs to aggregate and prioritise it in any meaningful way. Also the way some people write their feedback is just atrocious.By contrast MS have champs that are dedicated to checking Reddit and specifically this sub in order to collect feedback and pass it on.If a post gets a dozen upvotes and then a similar post gets a dozen upvotes and then again then again then again... this is a far more useful platform for a having a discussion about it b sharing workarounds that other people have found and c getting feedback in a consistent place.Of course I think people should also use the feedback app! But they should absolutely bitch and moan about it wherever there are eyes watching. If enough people share that opinion it will rise to the top and it will be noticed. The fact that these posts keep making the front page should be an indication that people continue to care about.

5896445,0,t3_3w0x12,I disagree.  Im a user of Windows primarily but dabble in pretty much all the other OSes out there.MS released a very much unfinished product.  Many of the apps were and still are missing features Edge.  They enabled some really questionable things by default sharing updates across the internet.  Only allowing people to defer updates to a later time unless you create a metered connection.  I have a few friends that cant use Win right now because the updates keep wiping out the newest Nvidia driver causing issues with Cuda.  The ONLY updates that should be mandatory are security updates period.  Some people need stable systems and forcing updates doesnt always allow for this.Installation issues are going to happen anytime you rollout an update much less an entire OS to millions of new users.  This doesnt really bother me at all.  All of this being said I have no issues running Win but I certainly understand those that do.

5899523,0,t1_cxsk3ns,Well I jumped to  from  skipping  entirely and it was pretty harsh to get used to . Even more than going from XP to Vista back in the days.First of all you have to understand that your OS is much more like a mobile OS than a pure desktop OS like Windows was up to  and I sadly doubt it will ever be like that again.You have to accept that pretty much anything is suddenly an app be it real apps from the MS appstore or programs suddenly being called apps. Then like a mobile os again you are constantly bound to Microsoft services with your live account.What also shook me was the bloatware W came with. Candy Crush preinstalled? Microsoft how could I ever take you for serious again?In the end after uninstalling all the useless stuff turning off crucial things like automatic driver installation and getting used to the new UI and the heavy online constraints I think the OS is about as good as Windows . But when I take all the useless stuff into consideration and the fact this is and always will be a mobiledesktop hybrid Windows  is the better desktop os until you need  for stuff like DX .I dont understand why MS cant completely separate between mobile and desktop.

5942094,0,t1_cxyi8gl,Windows  is not free. Try to build new PC right now and get it legally for free.Reason Windows  UPGRADE is free is because Microsoft is behind Apple and Google in the app store success and their Lumia and Surface hardware lines suffer a lot due to that.By having hundreds of millions of users with access to the Store they are not giving developers a choice.Microsoft is not profiting from your data. In fact they have sold their advertising business to Verizon recently. They collect a lot of data from every Windows  user because they have fired tons of testers and now rely on Windows Insiders program real users testing OS before release Windows Feedback app real users informing about issues and requesting new features and telemetry because when graphics drivers crash you cant count on majority to manually send you logs for you to work with Intel NVidia ATI or whoever on the problem.,Windows10,cxyje9q,6,t5_2u9xs

Boot from it and if your tv monitor works via hdmi then you know you can safely install windows  in the knowledge that if for some reason something goes wrong and the hdmi does not work you can restore old OS via the Macrium Rescue Drive.If you cannot see anything via the Rescue Drive recommend you do not install Windows  unless TV has a vga input and pc has vga output or you have a conventional vga monitor.Re drivers  that cannot be answered until you try it which is another good reason for making an image backup. ,Windows10,cy4orgm,1,t5_2u9xs

6078569,0,t3_3ysnvt,The UI works mostly but it isnt finished. The start menu fix was to increase the limit of tiles but theres still a limit. The search works but not reliably. You cant do much with the left side. And so on. The context menus work but arent consistent. The icons exist but were done by someone in MS Paint over a lunch break. You can set some colors but not everywhere and they dont match. It reeks of a beta build. The updates are welcome.But... the updates that break drivers or uninstall programs or revert privacy settings? Thats not instilling confidence. Microsoft has no one but themselves to blame for the bad PR of a beta build that they shipped as though it were finished if they wont even publish brief notes about what theyre changing. People cannot hold off the updates cannot know whats in the updates have to fix what got reset during updates and yet the UI noncritical but the first thing noticed by users still feels like a work in progress... all while MS forces the upgrade from  down peoples throats unapologetically. MS cant be surprised that a beta version without documentation or choice would upset people. Honestly even if they just had a UX team and a manager to keep them all on the same design language and had the team spend the last few months cleaning up the look and feel a bit colored bars better icons consistent menus and a few trivial options in settings a lot of the ill will would fade. But they really utterly completely have no interest in public opinion. Whatsoever. None.Sorry but marketing is part of business.

There are those who would argue that for Desktop users the Win versions of the apps are easier to use and offer more functionality than the Metro versions.  A better solution would be to use Metro apps while in Tablet mode and Win apps while in Desktop mode.  Win was rejected largely because the UI was forced to the lowest common denominator creating a miserable user experience for desktop users.  Poor control layout with excessive white space and oversimplified functionality with too many missing features.

7448528,0,t3_4hbf73,Well it works great on my HP Stream .  Might as well get your free upgrade.However upgrading tables needs a bit more care than a PClaptop.  Before you upgrade make sure you do following Make sure you know how to get to bios from memory you press power on and volume up at same time when tablet is installed.  If you need to reinstall old OS etc you may need this. create an . recovery drive by going to control panel recovery create recovery drive and click to copy recovery partition.This is because the tablet uses a special version .Bing and if you decide to reinstall . you cannot use standard MS ISO actually you can but it takes a lot more space and will not activate. Backup your rd party drivers in case you need them This is because tablets sometimes use special drivers not in standard MS iso. Recommend you install Macrium Reflect Free and make image backup to a usb drive MRF is only tool I found that reliably backs up tablets.  Then it is easier to revert.  Note if you do revert yiu can reinstall windows  at any point in future. Backup all valuable data of course. Download standard MS iso from here onto your SD card assuming you have one or a usb stick with OTG cable. Then double click on it and run setup.exe KEEPING ALL FILES so special drivers are kept etc. Once upgraded I recommend you make an image backup of Windows  in case yo need to reinstall it. ,Windows10,d2oumpl,5,t5_2u9xs

7465625,0,t3_4hlrxm,The Windows upgrade and large updates follow the same process of literally reinstalling the operating system and dropping the files back into place. Your items failing to copy over the first time likely means there was something wrong with how your user folders are setup and Windows doesnt know how to copy them properly.Many things could have gone wrong. From what Ive seen is theres no standard fix for this but do what you can and work backwards. Was your user account corrupted after the upgrade? You should have seen all of your desktop icons background and so forth. If you didnt Windows likely created a temporary account that would autodelete itself after a reboot. If thats the case the files are as good as gone. I have not seen anyone successfully recover files from this but a file recovery program from Piriform would not hurt. Undoing any restore point literally searching for a recent file anything to find your find your files is all you can do otherwise. The problem with the update is theres no simple go back. Your computer was stuck in a corrupted state that was fixed in the update.Whatever you do I would recommend taking all of your salvageable files and backing them up then refreshing the PC. Completely reinstall not keeping anything.,Windows10,d2qsn69,2,t5_2u9xs

Then assuming MS honour their own EULA then you will be able to transfer licence later.

But software decoding a p YouTube video isnt smooth as it should be requires around  from my old GHz Core  Duo E CPU and consumes a lot of energy I happen to have a Belkin consumption metter plugged on my computer these days.Please tell me this is only some sort of diagnostic and someone has a better solution! Also it doesnt fix decoding with the Films amp TV app or with other Windows Store applications relying on the Windows filters and codecs.

7916350,0,t3_4npsfy,I would do the following this is what I did. Split out your personal files from absolutely everything else. These are your documents photos music videos and anything else you might have created and that is absolutely irreplaceable this should go on a separate HDD thumb drive burned to DVD and tested or cloud storage depending on how much space theyll take up  no need to put them in a systemimage or anything. Doing this will have you prepared in the future for automating backups of these most important files anyways such as uploading them to a cloud backup service.. Figure out how important your settings are for various applications. Sometimes things like Visual Studio Autocad Blender games or whatever youll have spent a lot of time configuring key bindings and settings and the like.  You can try to recover as many of these settings as possible and put them next to the above folder on your backup media. CloneApp is a tool that can help out greatly here by automating the backups of all these different settings for certain programs.Id split these two kinds of files into those  groups because of how much more important the  is over the other. Usually the problem you can have with creating straight up system images is that they take huge amounts of space which you might not have enough room for on your spare storage media. You can use an imaging tool if youd like I wouldnt gaurantee that the your old windows install would  work after the reimage though.The best way to upgrade to Windows  is via a Clean Install from the Windows  Media Creation tool This will allow you to format the drive and start from scratch as opposed to having a bunch of old files and program remnants from your history with Windows  strewn about the place.However to get your free copy of Windows  you do have to go through the inplace upgrade first so that it would upgrade your Windows  key to a new one for . Then you can proceed to do the full clean installation  I know its a bit of a hassle but this is the only way to get the free key unfortunately. You can of course just do the inplace upgrade instead of a clean one and windows will do its best to carry over your user profile app datasettings and programs. No gaurantees on every program working tho especially older ones or really complex ones.,Windows10,d45vf8r,1,t5_2u9xs

As soon as my sub expired the computer version showed no lag and was pretty zippy all round. I dare say I would have kept the sub if it was this fast previously.,Windows10,d47dffl,3,t5_2u9xs

Install Windows  with your new hardware you might try just booting off your drive without reinstalling it may very well work after chipset driver updates this would save you a bunch of time. Use the Windows  Media Creation tool to upgrade to Windows   you need to do this first to get your free Windows  key based off the old Windows  one. Optionally use the same tool to perform a Clean Install in the event you want to start completely fresh with a hard drive format backup your personal data of courseKeep in mind that you need to match your media creation tool to wither Home or Pro based on your Windows  version.

8045565,0,t3_4petww,You are either trying to edit an image which you are not the owner of or the filelocation of the file has permissions restrictions.You may not be the owner because the SYSTEM account owns the file it was made by Windows during installation a different application created the image and it is in a protected location or the image was created by a different user account.Right click the file gt Properties gt Security tab gt Advanced gt look at the Owner towards the top of this window  it is more than likely not you. Either that or below youll see that your account doesnt have permission to Modify the file or it inherited the permissions from its parent location.Generally when you save an image off the web or transfer a file from a camera you are declared the owner. For whatever reason you are not the owner of the image you are trying to edit. You can change the owner from that window  unless it is owned by the SYSTEM account which means Windows created it and it is not meant to be edited or there are otherwise some permissions set on the file. You can still take ownership of these files from the command line andor by changing the permissions first but I would not recommend doing so in the vast majority of situations.If you would like to explain where the particular file came from then we might be able to help you understand why you are not the owner or why there are permission restrictions set up on it.,Windows10,d4kebtr,2,t5_2u9xs

The level of functionality is pretty different in terms of what it supports. And in that level of functionality its either Microsoft or nothing. Microsoft knows it has that monopoly position and thats why they arent afraid to do such things.gt if he doesnt save his data thats nobodys fault but his own.He wasnt aware of a need to save his data at that point in time and besides it doesnt address my earlier problem raised of big file uploadsrenderswhatevergt but iv never seen any proof of any and the funny thing about the people that iv heard of these bad updates from is that theyre all microsoft haters either apple or linux heads. Oh please no proof? Just google around and youll find plenty of bad updates throughout the history of Microsoft updates that had to be republished because the previous one broke something. It happens and if youre dismissing the clear evidence just because its from a source you deem to be probably unreliable then youre hardly being objective.gt as far as the danger that his computer poses to others hed complain pretty fucken loudly if his computer was taken over for a botnet account and would probably blame microsoft for it anyway.And Id laugh at him because thats his own fault. gt to survive in this world youve got to be at least a little bit utilitarian. also saying that youre not endangering other people by not getting your own security upgraded is almost word for word the logic that antivaxxers use to justify the actions that have led to the return of measles.The effect of a single computer joining a botnet on the security of each persons individual computer is far far less than that of vaccination. gt look botnet attacks dont happen very much any more .... and this is why. windows shuts down the vulnerabilities that are exploited to create botnet attacks. if even a small percentage of people say  refused to vaccinate upgrade their systems the botnet attacks will come back.Its not  its more like  or less in this case. The moment you restart its going to install. How many people actually leave their computer for more than a month without restarting or their power suddenly going out or something along those lines? Botnets also require a certain number of computers to do anything at all   computer isnt going to cut it neither is  or . Youll literally need thousands for it to do anything useful and even if you do manage to form a useful botnet whats the risk that the botnet will be directed in such a way that will cause you a significant level of harm? Thats what I mean by the harm is overstated. It does exist but I dont think its significant enough to justify the act in this case.gt and then he complains about windows defender  the antivirus software that is putting norton and mcaffee out of business.And I said nothing about that argument but again if hes using norton and mcaffee theres no real rush for him to have to restart to update an inactive Windows Defender anyway.gt youre defending him and thats admirable but you gotta think  is it worth it considering he hates on things that make life easier?Im not defending him as a person Im just defending the stance hes taking.gt do you really want to defend the position of someone that is basically the digital equivalent of an antivaxxer  prodisease fuckwit?Bashing his stance really doesnt cut it you know?

But basically what I ended up doing was a clean wipe install of Windows . Disabling windows update in  then upgradeing to . I havent gone back yet and done a clean install of  to wipe the drive again though likely tonight.I have to say that MS support was completly useless. Youd think that they would have figured this out by now. It took a week of digging around in message boards to figure this one out. It was pretty obvious that they guy wasnt in the US. I had to use the NATO Phonetic Alphabet to get codes across and he apparently didnt know that clean wipe and a formatted HD are the same thing. Native Indian speakers have a hard time with some American English pronounciations. Ive worked a long time with Indian engineers so I know how to do this but it is frustratingly slow. I take a copy of the NATO phonetic to my screen just to do this sort of thing. It was obvious that he was just reading off a flow chart and didnt really know what he was doing. The call took  minutes and he all but accused me of using a faked key  which isnt true. He did accuse me of not telling him what I was trying to do which isnt true as well.

Ok  it should be easy enough to do this for apps uninstalled using the app uninstall command.  I do laugh sometimes when we get complaints about an app being reinstalled that was uninstalled by an unofficial means as if they expect MS to detect dodgy methods were used.Personally I want a  robust upgrade mechanism and if I have to spend a few minutes once or twice a year sorting out TRIVIAL issues then fine by me. ,Windows10,d6p6ltp,0,t5_2u9xs

8718837,0,t3_4zex2z,So far only a Rails application I had around. Installed RVM which was a pain also because of some stuff that WSL doesnt include I had to aptget install a few files that RVM wanted and couldnt autoinstall Ruby bundler gem and MySQL. After that I just lnd my app folder on mntc to my home folder on WSL just for a shorter path to my app and started to install the required gems. The Rails server execute perfectly and you can access it from any browser even Windows ones. As such my editing is done on Windows too with VSCode andor Sublime Text. I can also access the database the same way from any Windows DB app like HeidiSQL.Its like a Docker container albeit a little weirder. I cant make it to execute my .bashprofile when opening Bash for example and I have to source it manually at each start if I want to use RVM also have to start MySQL Server manually.On the other hand its faster than ruby.exe.

8722485,0,t1_d6vxuf8,There is a Windows function called the Network Data Usage Monitoring Service. Network drivers provide a steady stream of information about their usage to this service at a lowlevel in Kernel mode. I imagine there are  possible things which cause the issue. The old Killer network drivers create the required data structures stores them in nonpaged pool memory memory used by kernel mode processes and just never release them. This causes your nonpaged pool memory to keep ballooning until there is no more free memory available. You can see this in your RAMMap screencap  these forgotten data structures are taking up GB of nonpaged pool memory.. The old Killer network drivers send incorrect or otherwise unusable data to the NDU service which isnt handled properly and never gets cleaned up by one or both components.It could be a completely different scenario but it is related to the NDU service and does represent what is known as a memory leak. This one happens to be in the kernel mode memory space which makes it appear to be invisible if you are just looking at the memory being used by your running programs.,Windows10,d6vy9j8,1,t5_2u9xs

PreSP Windows  right after release was better about this even when running on old hardware. They need better testing of the kernelanything else that runs in privileged mode but Nadella is too focused on cloudifying things for increased revenue to pay attention to that.

8744918,0,t1_d6y475e,Thats not an excuse for shipping broken software though. If you look at most testing release channels of most mainstream software it usually works very well. Windows  Insider versions are pretty much always broken here and there until  month before RTM and Im not even talking about obscure stuff being broken which tons of probably also are anyway hell they even are because of patches on stable channels but the main GUI things.The idea that you develop software by first writing code and bugs during a few months and then remove the bugs is insane. You can use a Debian Testing without virtually any problem at least compared to Windows  Insider versions.Also the main effect of release preview vs CB and fast rings vs slow rings is to delay when a build will be shipped to more people and skip some in the slow ring case. There is no stabilization phase in the process you will never get a more stable build that was not once a release preview or a fast one. Again compared to more proper distribution model of dev amp beta software something is missing where some of the bugs of the preview rings are actually fixed before a release... Without that extra process they can only avoid critical bugs by skipping a too buggy build so of course tons of non critical bugs well by their new standard will be eventually shipped.,Windows10,d6yrnwv,3,t5_2u9xs

Allow automatic updates immediate installation is set to disabled and Turn on recommend updates via automatic updates is also set to disabled and no autorestart with loggedon users for scheduled automatic installations is enabled.Regarding Windows Update I have it set to Manual on my laptop and Automatic on my Desktop. Also Disabling Windows Update should work. I had it set to Disabled for some reason on my desktop until last Thursday. This has the additional benefit of making the Windows Store inaccessible. Its not necessary or it hasnt been for me at least.I only see the occasional notification that Updates are available use Windows Update to install them. I did have to forcibly replace MusNotificationUX.exe and MusNotification.exe with donothing executable stubs and I have to do so whenever I run Windows update as they but that doesnt prevent updates it just prevents the annoying fullscreen userinterrupting nag that says I have updates.

Im back on version  and when my PC restarted it prompted me to do a disk check. It then did something with drive E my nd hard disk and when windows booted all was right again.Bullet dodged there.

The selection of the A or B drive letters is not prevented in any way there. Microsoft makes those drive letters available in pretty much every drive selection interface they make. If you are arguing that an interface is only for techies because its being used to select drives then by that definition youve made it impossible for a version of the interface to exist that is for nontechies and includes a driveletter selection. The minute the interface included any sort of drive selection it would be for techies. But how are you defining techie? Is it just someone that knows more than you about the topic? Are you not at that point just saying Microsoft should make an interface that somehow doesnt ever require learning how to use it.

Youll likely see a temperate peak at which point it will start to die down or plateau if still under load as the fans take care of things.Keep in mind that there could be a rd party program on your computer controlling power saving features andor fan speeds.

Make sure firewall is always on and all user accounts are protected with good passwords.  On the few times Im iffy about something I run it through  I havent run an antivirus on my computers in over a decade with no problems. But I can guarantee you if I did the same on my parents computer theyd be infected within a day or two. On my parents AVG free has worked fine though not  theres not much that can be done when a user install sketchy toolbars etc... For gamers I recommend Eset Nod as its pretty light on resources. Bit Defender Kaspersky are probably the most powerful catch the most. Nod was on sale this past thanksgiving  licenses for . Im sure anti virus packages will go on sale again during christmasnew years. Until then you can always run a free anti virus or trial out a commercial package.

Because of peoples strong paranoia and distrust of Microsoft people found any gap in the language that was not  water tight and ran with the worst case assumption e.g. the free for  year leading to idiots interpreting it as leading to a fee or subscription after  year. And of course this becomes the message because people are more likely to believe something that threatens them in some way.But I feel Microsoft need to be much more explicit in their communication to stop this happening.

11345134,0,t1_dfhxtw6,Its possible but its actually not easy. Using a tool like Xamarin can introduce limitations and complexity in to your app  sometimes it means that you cant use features that are particular to one platform or you have to have special cases imagine how you would design your app so that it can use TouchID on iOS but have a fallback for Android users. If youre coming from iOS ObjectiveC or Swift or Android Java you have to switch programming languages to C to use Xamarin. You might be familiar with Unity which is another tool in a similar vein  Unity games are seen on consoles iOS and Android devices PCs etc. so it does happen. Electron is another technology that allows for code sharing in app stores  Slack and many other big names use it.  Its just that the big mobile app development companies often prefer to make perfect and separate Android and iOS apps instead of trying to build a onesizefitsall Xamarin solution. That results in them ignoring smaller platforms. ,Windows10,dfhy8s2,11,t5_2u9xs

Then when Edgethebrowser was more developed they could have included it in one of the regular major updates. Instead they released it early and lost any good will users might have had for a brand new browser as well as repeating one of their biggest mistakes in tying the browser to the OS. I just dont understand why they did it and are now working to try and separate Edge from the OS. They made more work for themselves in every way i can think of Edit i would love to hear directly from Microsoft why they did it the way they did. They are pretty open these days about decisions but we have heard nothing about this.

There are atmos headphones around that dont do objects but do do binaural sound. They arent your typical headphones however they have multiple speakers inside and some form of sensor specifically what sensor depends on brand to accurately plot the direction and movement of your head.

11599470,0,t3_65j499,For smoother performance avoid from installing desktop apps seriously until you are forced too. Seriously. This is windows more software have you installed if not maintain properly it will slow your pc down. In additon desktop app installer also tend to include another unwanted software if you do not be careful like search bar ad etc. So as surface pro  user I have a very fast and smooth operation in my PC especially with the newly launched Creators update. Heres my recommendation. Use Windows Store Apps if posibble. Why? Its sandboxed  meaning its safe and will not bloat your PC no matter how much apps have you installed. Windows store apps have better touch input much like IOS version.For Media Player download ACG Player. Seriously This is the most feature packed beautiful and the smoothest media player that can play all format. Subtitle is supported internally and externally. Equalizer Image enhancement and hell even subtitle speed adjustment are also available. You can see the feedback from the store.For Zip or Rar or something like that you can download zip. A lot of media social apps in the store like facebook instagram messenger instapic etc skype that you can download. Trust me if you make yourself comfortable min tablet mode like me you will prefer the apps than the browser. For browser try to use Microsoft Edge with adblocker installed as its more efficent and more battery saving but keep in mind Edge is a little bit buggy thought the situation has been much improved in the new Creator Update. As for my case I installed Opera desktop installer as my backup browser.For PDF actually microsoft Edge can still open that but it offers basic functionalities. So instead of installing adobe pdf reader dektop program. download xodo pdf from windows store as its scrolling is smooth like butter and its light too as well as heavily features packed.For torrent app download torrex pro. Its visually beautifull and effective too and feel more modern.For better touch screen input for desktop program try download touchme gesture studio from the store. You can assign gestures for many fuction like minizing maximizing everythingSo anything app that you want try to search through windows store first as its apps are automatically updated and more secure. By saying that does not mean you have to ignore totally desktop apps. In  my case I have Microsoft office since the store version is pretty much lighter and does not have many features. Adobe Photoshop and VLC media player as backup media player. VLC is battery hog be careful. Use ACG Player in store instead.So when you are forced to install dektop app then you can install but be careful not to always click next next next in the desktop installer as it will setup another unwanted software.. Dont forget to organize your live tiles as if not it will look messy seriously.. If you have installed Creator Update then you will have a new feature in which you can ALLOW THE APP FROM STORE ONLY much like in Mac OS gatekeeper. So as for my case after i have installed everthing from the store and desktop program I turned the feature on to avoid virus from infecting my computer since the virus format usually will be .exe... Windows Defender is enough for me to keep myself from virus. No need to install other antivirusHope it helps,Windows10,dgat4a9,4,t5_2u9xs

Now the cloud will move everything to the cloud dispersed amorphous.  The main difference is in the web version you had one app the browser and one or more servers for everything per function. With cloud were getting separate client Apps for everything and a more complex backend cloudend. We never get what was promised before it changes to something completely different.    Next up maybe we will shift from cloud to galaxy computing or parallel universe computing with Artificial Reality.  This will be perfect...
