11773806,0,t3_67tom6,I love the little dexterous trick youre doing. Really makes me want to come up with a similar version for my method.At its core this is the Lunatic Method which Im not a huge fan of. Its functionally the same as what I came up with but upside down. The loop takes place inside the cuff rather than above it. This makes it tricky when you dont have a slack cuff like in the video above but more importantly forces the knot to roll under itself in an unnatural way that makes finishing troublesome and untying potentially difficult.,shibari,dgulfoa,1,t5_2seez
