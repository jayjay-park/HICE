841476,0,t3_23p0vm,We need to disable down voting and have a weekly official thread addressing each part of the script.Somebody said different communities for each but it would make more sense to pose main protagonist and have people comment. Once a week or so has passed then the comment with the highest upvotes gets accepted. Same for genre setting ect.,crowdscript,cgzxfmm,5,t5_2z8nk
