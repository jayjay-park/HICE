3369661,0,t1_cpbru51,I agree that Mania would be a great place to do it and the Dust Brothers deserve it. On the other hand there is definitely a part of me that wants to see it finished at Extreme Rules where I think we really could get a really crazy match both in terms of violence and sheer insane spots. I would love to see something as crazy as the Daniel Bryan forklift spot from last year and I think it would fit this feud so much better.,STRAIGHTSHOOT,cpcd74t,2,t5_36ng7
3376901,0,t1_cpd6ko6,Yeah it is tricky when things are scripted. I guess for example though take the New Day. Say you are Big E. you feel that as a performer you can do more and can really shine out as a single competitor if you can just figure out the perfect character. But Wrestlemania is coming up and you know that as long as you have something anything no matter how bad the gimmick youre gonna be on it. Why would Big E. ever speak up then and demand for something better when he can just ride whatever direction story wants him to go in because it means he can get a Wrestlemania paycheck. ,STRAIGHTSHOOT,cpd6wx2,1,t5_36ng7
3385439,0,t3_2yyh2s,That is kind of exactly what they are going for. Its how they stay heel while doing insane stuff in the ring.,STRAIGHTSHOOT,cpe6089,2,t5_36ng7
3410514,0,t3_2za52g,Hope WWE does some sort of Undertaker mind games tonight like similar he did with Kane for WrestleMania XX. I heard StardustGoldust is happening at live events hope to see it continue tonight. Make the tag team title picture look good again. And of course another awesome Paul Heyman promo,STRAIGHTSHOOT,cph0v77,1,t5_36ng7
3416297,0,t1_cph60of,The time was nice but I think the most important note is the increased intensityviolence with which they are working. Part of that is Nikkis strong style in the ring...the other is Paige taking a ring post bump on the outside. I thought that was really brutal looking and it definitely caught my attention.,STRAIGHTSHOOT,cphokl6,2,t5_36ng7
3482805,0,t3_304rdj,Dean Ambrose is the answer for me. The original Dirty Deeds was bad enough but once he changed it to a double arm DDT its just terrible.  ,STRAIGHTSHOOT,cpp9k2o,3,t5_36ng7
3497069,0,t3_307tjd,And Im going super creepy. Goodbye Horses by Tone of ArcAlso my finishing move would be the Buffalo Bill,STRAIGHTSHOOT,cpqw3ca,2,t5_36ng7
3606761,0,t1_cq3dxbn,Alrighty i got what you mean now aaand admittedly i have a bad habit of thinking about the time while watching NXT shows especially when there is  matches before a  out of  falls match. This goes so bad that i usually try to convince myself the show could end at any time because i didnt start it at  on the dot which requires lying to myself when i do start it at the right time which is weird but Ive come to accept its just a thing i do.,STRAIGHTSHOOT,cq3eajw,1,t5_36ng7

4478000,0,t1_cpb0djd,Looks like we will be seeing Michael Elgin vs Makabe after all as Elgins in the G Climax Goto vs Elgin is another match well see so you should be pretty happy haha,STRAIGHTSHOOT,csv4d58,1,t5_36ng7
