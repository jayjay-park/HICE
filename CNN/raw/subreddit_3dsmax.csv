But the short simple answer is clone your base object add a ProOptimizer modifier to it. Check keep texture and keep UV boundary. Click calculate and then lower the amount of polys. It does a very good job at keeping the original UVs and any distortions usually dont matter because you are viewing the model at a distance. ,3dsmax,chhci5j,3,t5_2rlfs

Unfortunately that is not what I can claim to be my proficiency with CD. I have pretty much only used it to export stuff to the software I know and use but there is one topic that comes up time and time again and that is extensibility. As far as I got to know and  mind you  that is by no means an objective opinion CD is somewhat of a marmite software. It does simple things exceptionally well but if you demand a certain thing from it that is not foreseen by the developers and you do not have plugins to help you out life is going to be very difficult. Maya ds max and other high level d packages are harder to grasp and more open.But still given the fact that last I used CD R to only export stuff I cannot have an opinion on whether the newer releases improved on the aspects that are relevant for you. All I can say is that maya and ds max can easily provide you with what you need.,3dsmax,cynm6md,2,t5_2rlfs

7622546,0,t3_4jo8ea,Rendering is a whole other kettle of fish and a very large field of study not to sound discouraging. Basically you can very rarely just hit the render button and get a perfect first render unless youre using a prefab scene or render settings. This is doubly so in Mental Ray  Vray. Learning how the renderer interprets the information from lights cameras etc. and how you can affect this is an education in itself.Best advice? Watch  read a few tutorials start doing test renders of single frames only until you get a look that you like then do the whole video. You may also need to look into how the renderer encodes the video file to avoid artifacting and glitches. Also remember that even once a video is rendered out you can still do post processing in something like After Effects as well.

11542217,0,t3_64pt36,I did a very quick test dont judge my skills by this people. TestI found a fire element I liked on youtube mapped it onto the inside of a sphere made the sphere an invisible light how you do this depends on your renderer and made a goldish material for my teapot. Unlike what I did here I strongly suggest doing separate passes and comping them together. Having a separate fire pass will give you much more control. ,3dsmax,dg4b8rc,2,t5_2rlfs

11808252,0,t3_67zqht,Did u fix it ? I had same problem and I fixed it by getting rid of MultiRes which tripled my file zise and replaced it with Optimize which only added mb to the file size when applied on  objects. Maybe you forgot a multires modifier somewhere use the  Modifier Modifier Zorb plugin to select all the objects that have the MultiRes modifier and delete it.,3dsmax,dgyi8kn,1,t5_2rlfs
