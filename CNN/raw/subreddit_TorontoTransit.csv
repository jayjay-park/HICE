3343769,0,t1_cp95mgy,Yeah its pretty shitty but I had a used car broke down previously and I gotta say sitting on the  during rush hour is in some ways worse!Anyway Ill probably end up getting another car or something but I figured Id post here first to see if Im missing anything. It looks like the only way to go EastWest efficiently north of Bloor is to drive on the  ,TorontoTransit,cp9exja,1,t5_2tug3
3372037,0,t1_cpckxa0,My life for the most part is work and my hobbies motorcycling and shooting. This means that suburbs definitely fit me best which is why Im not considering downtown. I drive everywhere but work and would do so living in North York or otherwise. Im seriously leaning towards the WhitbyGO combination even with the extra few hundred it could cost me.On the plus side if I keep my vehicle insurance bythebook actually change my address like I should its nearly breakeven because of how much more insurance is in Toronto.,TorontoTransit,cpcmy08,2,t5_2tug3
4551993,0,t1_ct4dlp4,Next time Im at the TRL Im going to look up some older city directories to find out whether it ever did have an apostrophe. In terms of the Toronto harbourfront historically Queens Wharf by Fort York definitely did have the apostrophe.,TorontoTransit,ct4egl0,1,t5_2tug3

And they dont consider time explicitly but your operators will get increasingly leery as you reuse a hour transfer on your circumnavigation of the system.The other implementations of Presto are mostly the firstgeneration devices which do display the balance and time remaining. OCTranspo is entirely secondgeneration Ive been there myself and the TTC is mostly secondgeneration which doesnt have the extra display.I agree completely that they should display the balance or at least if youre doing a transfer or new fare but that was the answer from the TTC the last time I asked. And re reinventing the wheel thats precisely what Presto is. Ontario suffers from Not Invented Here thinking on a regular basis  see the Scarborough RT eHealth Unisys ICON or any number of custombuilt stupidities.,TorontoTransit,d6i8oqj,2,t5_2tug3
10327898,0,t1_dcemscw,As OP stated they are under the age of  and are actually interested in buying student tokens because they are still eligible.They would thusly be eligible for the student MDP as well.I misspoke if I said Post Secondary MDP I meant the Student one. ,TorontoTransit,dceq3z8,1,t5_2tug3
10493799,0,t3_5q7lwk,I took the  a couple times from Yonge and Eglinton to DT. I always figured it should be half fare to relieve the subway a bit. They run a handful per day  usually half empty  so I doubt it would hurt their margins much if at all. ,TorontoTransit,dcxkywk,1,t5_2tug3
11086429,0,t1_deoldwp,Thank you!! I also have another question. If you take a TTC bus from the Union Station but I came from the GO do I have to pay for that or can I just walk in?,TorontoTransit,deomxsz,1,t5_2tug3
