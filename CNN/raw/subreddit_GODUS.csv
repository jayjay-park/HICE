1255229,0,t3_282l55,In order to make settlements less restrictive youll need to stop the whole concept of having an entire settlement devoted to builders farmers or miners. Have us decide what profession or guilds should exist in our particular settlement. Besides manually filling up buildings with a profession is pretty annoying why cant we just select the building and make it become the profession we want it to be? Also breeders and buffers make up for terrible professions and arent very creative.,GODUS,ciattvv,1,t5_2vn70

1478422,0,t3_2b2pec,One of the things I really enjoyed out of Black and White was that your followers had a level of belief in you and they also had needs and demands. Amazingor terrifying them would raise their belief and neglecting their needs would lower it to the point where they would stop worshiping you. The villagers in Black and White were a little TOO needy but I still think it was a good model. If something like that could be implemented it would make me feel that I have an obligation to my people rather than viewing them entirely as little puppets on strings.I also feel that their is a lack of customization in the game. At the moment I feel like a generic god controlling generic followers different only in color. Something akin to a morality system might be neat as long as its not forced. Id like to be a good deity who makes the land beautiful and my people happy or maybe an evil deity who covers the land in swamps and craters instead relying on fear maybe making my followers look more sinister as a result and have more sinister looking abodes.It would be nice to distinguish myself as a deity from others to be a deity with different moral values and attitudes which are reflected in the appearance of my lands my people my structures and my powers. ,GODUS,cj1lh4k,5,t5_2vn70

1664588,0,t1_cjo7pvi,I tested a workaround for the losing villagers overnight thing and its been successful a couple of times now.  What I do is max my civs happiness meter via rainbeautifyfountaintree and then right before I quit activate a fountain or Tree of Joy.  That ending celebration appears to keep my happiness meter maxed while Im out of the game so that when I come back both happiness meters are still maxed out and no followers have changed hands.Its not an ideal way of doing business but it might keep you from some future frustration.,GODUS,cjozeg0,1,t5_2vn70

1766193,0,t3_2epd3a,By observation it seems that GODUS always tries to fit the largest plot in a new area then fills in with smaller as you are expecting. I have noticed sometimes when I am actively sculpting out a flat area the smaller plots already laid out will stick rather than redraw to fit the larger area. However this is not always the case so I cant say what the trigger is. You should be able to force the creation of a rank  plot by pulling a layer in so that theres no room for multiple rank  plots. Once the rank  appears you should be safe to push the layer back and see more s and s appear.Sorry I couldnt be more definitive help.,GODUS,ck1s9ch,2,t5_2vn70

2032319,0,t3_2i0j3d,Im still of the opinion that the Astari are nothing but a distraction from the simple fact that Cans has no idea what their end goal is. We dont have procedural terrain generation which is easy Ive done it many times we dont have competent pathfinding which is easy Ive done it many times and we dont even have followers capable of thinking for themselves beyond following orders. They arent delivering anything that even looks like the game they promised and we all paid for.

2294475,0,t3_2liyld,Heres what I did First you want to have Finger of god Meteor and Swamps.Also make sure you have Beautify for cleanup.Now to destry the village.Meteor the village a few times. This will cause most if not all the Astari to exit the village and cause great lag and unhappiness. Now finger them all. There probably are  left so you want to wait for a celebration and swamp the shrine. If there are still a few left throw down another meteor.Then when all the Astari are dead you are able to fingerspam Astariville and clean up the swamps with Beautify.I do not recommend this. Instead chuck a gem on it to inhabit that area and boom sequence breaking. Theres even a cute little beacon nearby right next to the Ark. It takes  rocks to build.,GODUS,clvbadk,1,t5_2vn70

2996441,0,t3_2kj78j,Create settlements to employ farmers to reach  plots of farm first. To do this you have to use the smallest possible size of plot wheat by readjusting your land carefully bit by bit. Personally I got  fields in one circle of verdant land.After that you may want to maximise your wheat yield by going for the  wheat plot which gives you the best yield. A lot of readjusting of land is needed before you can create them.  is the maximum with only   wheat plot and six  wheat plots. It should give you a hexagonal shape that has  in the middle and  by each of the sides. A whooping  wheat can then be collected.Also do not build your settlements close to the verdant land as this will make readjustment of the land difficult. To readjust the land try to make sure that there isnt a plot in the direction where you are pushing the land to and about half or slightly more of the green land is required to make farmers settle on the plot. That is all. I havent tried maximising plots for mining yet so good luck and have fun in Godus!,GODUS,co8kudm,1,t5_2vn70
