208383,0,t3_1wi41c,If you want to explain this cut to your hairdresser this is what I do.Sides are cut using a  Blade .mm up to the parietal ridge of my head. I like it high and tight even in the back.I use a A  .mm blade around my ears and in the nape of my neck. My head bulges slightly just above my ears and I like strong straight lines in my mens cuts. I cut closer around my ears to make up for shape of my head. I also have a fucked up neck line so I use a closer fade at my nape to get rid of my fugly neck line. Normally I recommend mens neck lines to be straight across. Women tend to round the corners. Dont do this. Mens cuts should have strong straight lines. Because masculinity.The top is all the same length right now approx . inches longI am still growing it and I would like the fringebang area to be a bit longer but right now at this length I am very happy.Girlfriend and female clients seem to love it.EDIT When I say clipper blade I dont mean a guard. I use Oster Classic  clippers and they have replaceable blades in varying length. When I do this cut on my clients I do not use clippers. I do the the sides with scissor over comb method. Cutting my own hair is hard enough there is no way I could do scissor over comb. Thats why clippers.,malehairadvice,cf26fac,3,t5_2s1me

However after a month or two it was a lot better.The pH reversion really does take quite a bit of time it is not a quick process. The big thing I did was nothing except water in my hair after almost a year of trying different methods for a month straight. There were some really uncomfortable hair days in there but my hair has never been as good as it has now been for the last few months.  Also at this point I use the honey and acv only once every ish weeks at this point maybe go even longer and my hair is really great.

523412,0,t1_cfz54fo,Mens hair will obviously dry much faster. Until you get it down exactly I recommend using a low and warm not hot setting so hat you have a little tiny bit more time to work with it before it dries into shape.Use a concentrator. It is a piece you put on the end that flattens out and projects the air into a stronger feeling fan shape. This will help you to aim the blow dryer and not just have hair blowing all over.Always use a product or oil or heat protectant on the hair before blow drying. This will protect your hair and help it from looking damaged from the heat.Do not pick an old crappy blow dryer or a Conair brand of any age. Go online and get some feedback on a few blowdryers. If you are serious about your hair good tools are worth it and will last muuuch longer. Check out chain salons Smartstyle Regis Supercuts etc. For blowdryers. Sometimes they have sales on heat tools. Always compare to prices online. A few good brands include Chi Paul Mitchell Babyliss Revlon Hot Tools. There are more but I use Babyliss and Hot Tools.Praaaactice!,malehairadvice,cfzrn37,1,t5_2s1me

598554,0,t3_20xsoe,Imo the sides are way too short. This cut can look great but it just doesnt work for you. I would advise you to keep the sides a little longer and grow the top a bit more. Try to go for that fauxhawk style again but maybe curl the front to the back if you know what i mean? Just grow the sides longer the top aswell but keep the top like double or triple the length of the sides. You can do many styles with that. Justmake sure next time you go to the barber he shouldnnt cut the sides too short and he shouldnt thin out the top.hope i could help. ,malehairadvice,cg8b51k,2,t5_2s1me

Using a light hold cream will be super easy just spread it throughout and let it do its thing. Just to accent what youve already go. Also trying growing it out a bit more see how you like it. A cream would also keep it from become too bushy. You can also ask your barber or stylist thin it out a bit too. ,malehairadvice,cjelrjq,2,t5_2s1me

Those loose hairs were going to fall out at some point whether you are are washingbrushingblow dryingstyling your hair or even while sleeping.  But  hairs in your hands after styling seems excessive though.  Do you notice hair falling out at any other time besides after styling?  What product name are you currently?  Do you experience hair after every time you style it or just occasionally?    To achieve that look I would recommend a texture paste  for a semimatte finish or a beeswax paste  for a natural matte finish with incredible hold.  I would also recommend using a blow dryer while fingercombing to help give your hair volume and a natural combed look.,malehairadvice,ck858js,1,t5_2s1me

Water based has the same shine to it but really easier to wash because its water based.Me in particular am biased towards American Crew Pomade. Really great product. But Brylcreem has that vintage feel to it because its exactly what the guys wore at that time.

Then I take a healthy amount of pomade either Suavecito or Shiner Gold both cheap good hold good texture and wash out easy and style. I style using wet hands and a wet comb and wait a few minutes while it dries completely to make sure it settles how I want. If not I rewet it and fix it.

Sometimes my friends talk about jawline credit like if you have a short beard you can still have a nice jawline you can kinda even shape your jawline to look a little better than it actually is.  The woman who cuts my hair told me she always thinks guys pull their beards too far down their necks and that I was too.  Instead she recommended trimming it close to under the jawline this guy is a pretty good example of getting jawline credit without having too short of a beard ,malehairadvice,cp4su0v,4,t5_2s1me

3380977,0,t3_2ytm0d,Id say get sides around half of an inch maybe a bit longer if you have Asian hair to prevent it from sticking out. Then you want to blend that into the top which the barber will do by default. As for the top Id say about . inches in the front cut shorter to  inches towards the back and thinned out with thinning shears to make it easier to style. For styling just blow dry it backwards. If you have Asian hair you might need a prestyling spray or mousse to make it stay when blow drying. I suggest big sexy hair root pump plus or by Vilain sidekick. Just put these products into damp hair with a heat protectant then blow dry. Once the hair is dry just take a matte finish strong hold product such as the generic Hanz de Fuko claymation but if you want a little shine I would suggest Baxter of California clay pomade or hairbond shaper. All have excellent reviews. After styled just put in a hairspray.,malehairadvice,cpdnn84,1,t5_2s1me

So I dont think you should tell people to not use shampoo when the issue is actually people are using shitty drugstore shampoos full of sulfates. Perhaps you should suggest they go pay a tad more and get a nice sulfatefree professional shampoo. Shampoo isnt really meant to clean the hair its to cleanse the scalp. I dont care how much you scrub your scalp with water or conditioner it does not compare to washing your scalp with shampoo. Without proper washing your scalp has all these dead skin cells that arent being scrubbed off. The only proper way to clean those skin cells off is with shampoo. I can understand not using shampoo on a daily basis but at least once or twice a week is necessary in my opinion. ,malehairadvice,cs10gm1,10,t5_2s1me

I wont pretend you have the worlds best hairline but it isnt that bad really. You look at least  years younger in a bad way with your current hair.Minimal styling is an issue every one of those haircuts you posted will have been styled in some way at least probably all very carefully to be honest.If you get a high fade a la Beckham a while ago you can probably hide the fact that its receding to some extent but it will require fairly frequent cuts to maintain I think not too sure.,malehairadvice,cssbmoo,1,t5_2s1me

4656569,0,t3_3epxon,I just recently received some quicksand. Its a very interesting product but I dont think its what Im looking for.It makes your hair feel very dry and rough as expected. The problem is that it doesnt add enough weight to my hair. It adds plenty of that beachy texture but not enough hold in my experience. Its very matte. No sheen at all.I usually consider my hair thin but since sticking to cowashing and infrequent blowdrying my hair has taken to feeling thicker and sticking upwards on its own. This is sort of nice but not enough Id like it to go back and down rather than straight up in a wavy fashion. I figure this is due to the medium length of my hair. In this way my hair is thin but sort of strong. Since my hair sort of has body already quicksand doesnt seem to add any more.YMMV.,malehairadvice,cthip4u,1,t5_2s1me

Uppercut Deluxe was my first pomade as long as you make sure you work it thoroughly through your hands apply all the way to the roots and then comb the crap out of it you should be fine. Dont use very much it sets solid. The advantage of Uppercut Deluxe is that is you rinse it in water itll come out leaving your hair in fresh tip top shape. This is why youll be alright since you cant really damage anything other than your pocket. Its not cheap and I burnt though my first tin much much faster than substituent tins. edit King Brown and Uppercut are Australian brands so I assumed you were Aus but Uppercut is available in the US apparently,malehairadvice,cwpdw0p,3,t5_2s1me

Pick up a hairdryer from the thrift store and see if blowdrying it down doesnt help along with some dollar store conditioner if youre up for it.

Do like a  or  first to just feel it out get the hang of it. That way you have room for mistakes. The cool thing about doing your own hair is that you can take a shower after or you could just cut your hair before you take a shower thats what I do. Also make sure instead of cutting the hair on the top you thin it. Its a much safer way of cutting your hair and it looks more natural. Just in case you dont know how to thin hair all you do is just take the strand or bulk of hair you are going to cut and take your scissor and cut very gently dont cut down all the way through the strand remember you are thinning it not cutting. If you need a video for that I can get you the one I watched when I was learning to cut hair.  All that is left is make sure the area you cut your hair in is prepared! Just get towels put it on the floor and on your shoulders. Stay confident about it Im sure it will look great. If you decided to do it soon post pictures of before and after okay?

7461035,0,t3_4hgi0j,Just out of curiosity is this long enough to tie up? Try doing it when its wet. The issue here is that your hair looks damaged and stripped of its natural curl pattern. This is most likely due to the product you put in your hair and possible picking to get the big fro look. You could try to just go to a barber and ask him to clean you up so its a more even shape or you could try to find a good curl activator or leave in conditioner and apply it to your hair to see if you get some of your curls back. A lot of people here are suggesting short cuts but they are all of curly hair and they dont realize that your hair might not return to its curl texture for awhile. Something you could at least try is to get a curl sponge and some product to clean up and give your fro a more polished look. Some barbers might even do this for you but it simple depends where you are and where you go. I highly suggest avoiding salons majority dont understand how to work with curly hair let alone afros.

Its so hard to work with. I dont want to cut the top super short because my hairline looks disgusting but every longer style Ive tried looks bad because of how thin my hair is. Im not going to buzz it thats out of the question. But if anyone has any other suggestions Id love to hear them and preferably see pictures because I need a new haircut before heading off to college.

A lot of people have undercuts so you could look into those.The only advice I really have apart from check out pictures of things you like is blow drying your hair up and having your sides a bit shorter than your top since that tends to look better for most people than having it go down. Id also suggest playing around with what length you like having on the top since some people like it shorter like this while some like it a bit longer or like this Theres also different ways to style it at different lengths so look at that too.,malehairadvice,d6nu9yw,1,t5_2s1me

So with my eyebrows I tell them to wax shape them up and leave it to the stylists expertise. With hair is there anything I shoot for or should I just refer to stylist besides dying once again? Regarding the horrorstache its gone and I got rid of it after those pictures but is growing any type of facial hair worth my time or just move forward clean shaven? The shiners under my eye actually are from a little fight I got in recently however I have seen some darkness under my eyes before and have previously considered starting A routine in general could you recommend any skincare products? Lastly I live in Missouri very humid. Will my stylist recommend a routine along with a cut?Edit I keep seeing the word esthetician is this interchangeable with a master stylist?Edit  should I let my hair grow more before seeing one or would I be okay to go asap.I cannot thank you enough seriously. ,malehairadvice,d8nyyf1,1,t5_2s1me

9290455,0,t3_57nc2s,My hair does what his does but a bit more understated. Basically my hair goes naturally to the right so when I blow dry it I blow dry leftward while scrunching with my fingers. This allows my hair  like his  to start moving one way at the roots while the tips end up curving another. So my hair at the roots will sway right and end upward curving towards the left.

I go for a more disheveled look though. If you are looking for help from products I cant really help with that.

9837054,0,t3_5g43u6,Okay.You need some shape to your hair. You also need to stop using a comb. Using a comb makes all the hairs look too uniform and will make any thinning or balding stick out like a sore thumb. Combs should really only ever be used when trying to achieve that hipster hard partMad Men look. Im a big fan of more natural hairstyles. I would highly suggest growing out your hair a bit while you still can and using some sort of fiber or pomade product. I dont have a hair loss problem personally but my friend does and uses Rogaine and has had great results. In the long run you may just need to bite the bullet and keep your head shaved. But for now while youre young and in college theres no reason why you cant try to have a good head of hair for a bit. When using either fiber or pomade you just need to use about a quartersized amount in your hair. Theres no real method to it. Just work it into your hair spiking pieces here and there. Maybe twisting some sections for extra texture. The longer your hair is on top the more you can do with it. You could go with either of these and look a lot better.Shorter HairMediumMessy HairMy suggestions for products are below.. Layrite  Good hold. Will give some shine to your hair. Water based so it washes out easily.. Fiber Grease  Asian product so the directions and labeling are oddly worded. But smells like apples and has very good hold with good shine. Water based as well so it will wash out easily.. American Crew Fiber  Decent hold. A lot of people on this sub like this one. Provides more of a mattenatural look to your hair. Its a little more waxy feeling. Still washes out just not as easily as water based pomades.. Rough Rider by Kevin Murphy  Most expensive option. Probably the best hold out of all the products mentioned here. A small amount goes a long way this container will last you a long time. More of a clay feel in your hands. You may want to use this in combination with a shiny fiber like the Fiber Grease as Rough Rider has more of a matte finish to it. EDIT I agree with urogertaylorswift. Keep the sides clean and trimmed but leave yourself some length on top to play around with. A little product goes a long way. The key is not using too much. Then you get into the realm of seeming like youre trying too hard as you mentioned. All these products are available off Amazon. I wouldnt go crazy trying to find them in China when you can just get them delivered to your dorm room. ,malehairadvice,dapsh6o,1,t5_2s1me

10686852,0,t1_ddi6vk0,Wow. okay as mentioned in the top post you have great facial features and could do really well with short hair.  Like the others the gauges and piercings are a little tough on the eye depending on the environment youre going to be in mostly.  However even they could work with a more edgy style.If I were taking you for a cut Id go semiconservative in the chop and keep your hair a little bit longer on the top for styling and maybe shoulder length max or a bit shorter.  I wouldnt dive into a super tight fade right away until you see how you like your hair shorter.  Definitely get it off your ears though.  The earcovering hair is one that most people cant pull off and if I were honest Id say you kinda fall into that category.  Personally I just dont think it looks anywhere near as good as with your hair pulled back.I know I didnt really give you any styling advice on this but wanted to reassure you that an updated cut would give you a more maturemodernprofessional look without going super businesscut.,malehairadvice,ddi9oxe,9,t5_2s1me
