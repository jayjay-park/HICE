Theres about  stops located between the administration building  going west a block along the walking paths towards the stadium.

Its been a Kabuto nest since November th literally the day after I finally got enough for Kabutops.  The same thing happened to me when it changed to a charmander nest. The very next day after I evolved my Charmeleon the charmander nest appears.  Im vain enough to believe I influenced it ha! I was both excited and really bitter lol.,WinnipegPokemonGO,db5hr99,1,t5_3fbq3

10213165,0,t1_dc0pzw1,You know what I think it was the same. In fact my new theory is that this Charizard was once someones starter Charmander that they evolved. But of course when this trainer leveled up and came across a better Charizard he sent this CP Charizard to Professor Willow. Not content with being traded for candies this Charizard teamed up with a gang of Rattatas and broke free and now they all troll trainers by wasting Pokeballs and running free. You can tell Ive been thinking about this just a little too much!,WinnipegPokemonGO,dc1pxm8,3,t5_3fbq3
