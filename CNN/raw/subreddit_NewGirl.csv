2405839,0,t3_2mpi9m,I think this was the weakest episode of the season in terms of laughs.  Relative to the others.  By itself I still enjoyed it.However it feels pointless whenever they explore Jess employment without bringing in Angela Kinsey Brian Posehn or Curtis Armstrong in order to dial up the silliness.  The idea of these apatheticmentally unstable people teaching junior high students is hilarious by itself.  The writers have created a universe in which Jess is the normal person when measured against her colleagues at the school yet equally awkwardcrazy when with her roommates.   ,NewGirl,cm92jw8,0,t5_2srt3

The Thanksgiving episode for example the one where they go camping was awful just not funny at all. And also the fact that it took a while until Coach started being quirky and approachable before that he was kind of a bore at least for me. Edit some typos.,NewGirl,cnhe9y1,2,t5_2srt3

6294730,0,t3_41rjcg,Really enjoyed this episode. More than anything Im liking this new Winston he has been amazing this season. Also a harkening back to Schmidt being a bit of a douche. I heard they were going to do a story line about Cece being messy because she is hot in an interview last year but I was really hoping it was going to be over  episode span. Wouldve been nice to just have it in the background then have nick and winston talk about it for  seconds in an episode than this kind of episode. Oh well. Im excited to see how they handle the show without Jess and I hope we get more John Cho. ,NewGirl,cz5517t,9,t5_2srt3

Take Nick from her SLs and give me Schmidt Winston Cece. Put her in separated SLs with guest stars in minor stories.

She was so much less intensely quirky and actually had believable characteristics as well as a bit of meaningful sweetness at the end of Helmet.  It felt like Jess at her best.  I would really love for the upcoming episodes to be more like this.As well Winston and Schmitt were hilarious and adorable in Helmet.

As the seasons go on it have a harder time choosing favorites and it changes as I watch reruns of the show too. From season  onward it was a pretty solid Nick as top choice reminds me of my fianceturnedhusband throughout the run of the series though in season  it was definitely Winston. Then when I watched reruns for the first time Jess turned into my favorite especially with the Reagan episodes I guess Im one of the few who didnt enjoy her very muchand Im not hating on Megan Fox she can be really funny! ...I just feel they didnt use her to her full potential in her episodes..Right now Id have to say its Jess. What started out as an overquirked leading lady has evolved to a consistent wellrounded character and I enjoy seeing her and all the gang. Its a close call though!,NewGirl,d8dqfh6,2,t5_2srt3

For New Girl that would be awesome we could see Cece and Schmidt struggling with life with a baby Aly and Winston now married and getting into shenanigans and presumably Nick and Jess together and hopefully with one last glimpse of Nick and Tran hanging out on a bench.,NewGirl,dff83z4,20,t5_2srt3
