547029,0,t3_20e7m2,Given that they nearly swept us last year Ill preface this with no intent to boast.  This is probably the only safe place to criticize the Browns for a Baltimoron they sure as hell dont want to hear it from us in the NFL subreddit. Im not quite ready to award them the Dan Snyder Trophy for their offseason. They managed to get older by signing Dansby and Whitner and I cant say either of those were vast upgrades over Jackson and Ward respectively. Theyre paying a lot for Andrew Hawkins who hasnt played a ton of snaps and had battled injuries. That said hes an electrifying player in space. But you pay for production you draft potential. If they overpay Ben Tate whos got a lot of mileage on him and hasnt done it without Foster first tiring out the D Ill add him to the list.

611953,0,t3_2134ez,I am personally interested in Josh Freeman as a backup. Lets be honest Tyrod is good enough to maybe finish them game but hes not a longterm solution if Flacco got wrecked. Freeman on the other hand has all the physical tools to succeed as a quarterback in this league. Not to mention I feel his toolkit is similar to Joes so the gameplan wouldnt have to change as much. The biggest problem I would see with Freeman apart from the dipshit fans calling for him the minute Flacco has an incompletion is his mental state. Not sure if he has confidence anymore but I think the Ravens locker room would get him sorted out if hes interested. I also doubt hed be too expensive since there isnt really a market for him at the moment.   Allinall I think hed be the most able backup QB weve had since Marc Bulger. ,ravens,cg9txi9,2,t5_2s1w8

638862,0,t1_cg9uzzz,I disagree with your logic and heres the difference for me you can equally blame Evans for the drop as you can credit the defender with the strip.  The only person that stopped Cundiff from making the kick was himself.  He purely simply choked.The Evans play is one that happens a dozen times during a gamea pass falls incomplete and theres  creditblame between the defender and the receiver.  The kick was an extra point essentially something that theyre actually considering changing because its too easy.Yes the Evans play was for the win and the Cundiff one would have only been for the tie but the miss guaranteed the loss. The only downside of the Evans play is that we didnt win but still had a chance to tie.In fact if you want to blame anyone besides Cundiff blame Harbaugh for not calling a timeout when it was clear there was mass confusion and the critical kick would be rushed.  But really its on Billy. Routine kick and he should have made it. ,ravens,cgcw0yk,1,t5_2s1w8

Decent but not great top speed.  Great in pass protection and good hands out of the backfield.  Heres what Matt Hasselbeck had to say about him a few years ago when they were both on the SeahawksNot true Hasselbeck said about the knock that Forsett is too small. If you just watch one play of him in pass protection you would know that he can play. When hes up in pass protection he dominates. Hes really as good as anybody Ive seen.He gets low. He hits you right up under the chin. Hes very smart. Whoever he had in college coached him up well. From Day One he knew what to do and how to do it. Hes been able to run forever and hes been able to catch balls forever. But the pass protection part of it if you can do that thats impressive.

2265228,0,t1_clrhvx0,Personally think the Terps not shaking hands with Penn State is a genius marketing move. Even though Edsall said he wasnt involved I think a seed was planted in the players heads by someone above them.  Here is why... Maryland moves into a new conference.  Terps have an average football team and probably fall in the last tier in the conference.  For years in the ACC Maryland struggled to find a true rivalry one where there is mutual hatred on both sides think Ravens vs. Steelers many Duke fans did not feel that way about us. If we beat Penn State while shaking their hands many Penn State fans forget about us and the loss by next week.  Now Penn State fans legitimately hates us and due to location and students many students make a decision between attending UMD or PSU Maryland finally has the chance to have a real rival.   ,ravens,clrpa1j,7,t5_2s1w8

It makes me sick watching this game turn into something where the expectation is that you cant play defense cant play until the whistle on defense and cant try to make a play on defense.Receiver made a leaping catch and is spinning around running upfield and ducking his head to impact defenders? Better lay off wait for him to catch the ball and run a few steps then try to arm tackle him.Running back stood up and pumping his legs to try to gain more yards?  Better lay off and just stand there and watch the play because tackling him when he was probably gonna go down anyway is just too rough and dangerous.I seriously cant believe we put up with this shit.,ravens,clt3iom,0,t5_2s1w8

2767703,0,t1_cnigcdl,I guess they keep them separate because they would inflate the stats of players on better teams.Imagine you have two RBs one of whom averages  yards per game  on the season and one of whom averages  yards per game  on the season.Now lets assume that RB  is on an otherwise average team who finishes the season  and misses the playoffs and RB is on a team who finishes  and makes it in as a wildcard.  He then goes to put up another  yards in the wildcard game another  in the divisional game a nice  in his conference championship and finishes out with a beautiful  yards in the Super Bowl.If we are including post season stats that RB has racked up  yards in total beating out the current record holder by  yards.So capping everyones stats at  games an making playoffs their own thing is a way of ensuring that good players on average or bad teams still have a chance at making or setting records on a relatively level playing field.,ravens,cnioeav,9,t5_2s1w8

The Ravens are the opposite.  The scouts obviously thought highly of him.Most college athletes arent immediate contributors to the NFL.  He played fairly well during his rookie year.  Obviously he regressed last year but our whole secondary was in turmoil.He needs a veteran safety and needs to be given time.

So once again why SHOULD Pitta give up millions to maybe one day play football again?Pitta doesnt owe the team a dime. He didnt force them to give him a contract.

Im imagining that hasnt changed in the couple years since I was a mod obviously using another account.No one was paid to be a mod.  So youre asking the moderators here to expand what they do without having an effective way of combating the problem.  I wouldnt sign up for that nor would I expect the mods here to.  Just moderating the people on one sub is enough free labor without worrying what Ravens fans are doing everywhere else.IMO the best course of action is just to downvote report and move on.  If the moderators dont ban people from their own sub the reality is there isnt much you can do about it.  Banning them from here assuming they are dumb enough to troll other subs with the same username really wont accomplish much since account bans are so easy to circumvent. It will just make them more pissy and prone to fly off the handle in rravens just with a newly created account.So no I dont believe rravens mods should concern themselves with monitoring users or responding to what they do beyond the scope of their control which is just what goes on here.,ravens,col7pg3,8,t5_2s1w8

3267098,0,t3_2xjku1,Overall I think most fans know exactly what Flacco can do with his abilities on the field. We know he can bring us to the playoffs and not consistently choke or have announcers ponder if he will play worse in cold weather. Hes had a lot of different supporting cast members on offense and can consistently perform in his range regardless of who he is throwing toworking with. Also many of us are aware that for the majority of his career Flacco was surrounded by great defensive talent and leadersspecifically Lewis Reed and Suggs to name a fewall of whom never left our team with questions of how well our defense could perform. On the flip side our most recent season proved that Flacco can even bail out the defense when they are not clicking on all fronts. QB stats do not always favor Flacco throughout his career but I trust him in the  minute drive and I think our special teams Tucker can bailed him out of drives that stall out.Our front office and management has generally surrounded Flacco with what he needs to succeed and to compete with in the AFC. A lot of people forget that Flacco has faced off with great talent in the post season and in a decent span of Super Bowl winning AFC teams. In the playoffssince Flaccos rookie yearthe Ravens have lost to the Steelers AFCCG  Colts Divisional  Steelers Divisional  Patriots AFCCG  theres a special banana boat in hell reserved for Lee Evans and Cant kick Cundiff Super Bowl Champs!  and the Patriots . I understand that QBs are not on the field at the same time and comparing them is sort of moot however they are competing to see which QB can out perform the other on offense. Two of the three QBs Flacco could not outperform in the playoffs are st ballot HoFers and Burger Boy has a decent shot if he keeps it up. How many quarterbacks can enter Indianapolis Foxborough or Ketchup field and not break under pressure...I can name one who has proven that year in and year outJoe Super Bowl MVP Iron Dick Cannonforanarm Flacco. Also Flacco is one of the first real drafted as a rookie franchise QBs we have ever had and exceeded all expectations I have ever had.TLDR Flacco does what he is supposed to do for the Ravens by getting us to the post season and consistently challenging hall of fame quarterbacks year in and year out. Rarely having question marks on defense has benefited Flacco and probably helped sustain success.,ravens,cp0oc6i,50,t5_2s1w8

3848637,0,t3_34iilj,You are completely correct. Perriman is substantially larger and substantially faster than Torrey Smith.Perriman was not a first round talent. However all of the experts agree that there were only about  first round grades in this draft. The second and third rounds are bloated.I believe a tradeout would have been the best decision... but only marginally. This caliber of speed would not be available by the th pick on the second day.EDIT You guys are confusing a round grade with draft ranking. Round grade ignores what other players are in the draft. Draft ranking simply orders the best players to the worst players.

3852122,0,t1_cqv4tz8,. Comparing him to DHB is silly. If you think thats a solid comparison you arent really looking into the player and the context of his abilitiesproduction.. Safer options than arguably the most athletic WR in the draft? Who Strong? I hate the take what another redditor said in this very post and use it but hes right  Strong plays slow in college and is going to have DBs all over him in the NFL. We have players to run those types of routes and theyre better than Strong is. Whoever you thought the safer pick was every professional disagrees with.. Mark Clayton was a decade ago let it go. Torrey had bad hands and became a great received for us. We have new coaches new philosophies and a new QB from back in those days. Look at our recent WR picks theyre been great for the spot they were drafted. Aiken Marlon well not a draft pick but still a young acquisition Torrey Camp and more...I dont believe he dropped bc of his hands thats was a known issue prior to the combine. He dropped because thats the way the draft played out. Not many teams go BPA they take position into account over anything. Him falling to us was actually pretty awesome I just personally wish a top CB had fallen instead.The dude is also more than speed down the sideline. Hes a big body and catches in traffic. His hands have gotten better. All of his issues are coachable. Weve taken young receivers and theyve done well just look at our roster. I have full faith not only in Oz and our coaches but in Perriman. He has a great QB that throws lasers.

4908927,0,t1_cud7bt2,I just watched and I agree  I think Suggs was aiming for  inches and honestly watching that link  I think initial contact is made that high and he slides down. So he could have even been aiming higher. And you cant tell a football player to completely consider the situational there  that Bradford hasnt run the read option first game back  its a Chip Kelly offense man. If you see it you have to react to it cause you just never know.All in all given that he hit above the knee I think we can all agree this isnt premeditated to injure as he clearly had the ability to target the knee if he chose. All in all Im glad it didnt result in any injury but I dont see enough evidence here. I do think that the playcalling shouldnt be putting Bradford in that situation though.

Joe even though he made some crucial mistakes did not get pessimistic. He fought again and again and tried his best to bring it back. His final pass to Aiken was classic clutch Flacco.   Defence Will Davis and Zadarius Smith. The first for outstanding coverage and posing as a paradigm to be followed to the rest. The second for two amazing sacks that probably saved our asses.

5364658,0,t3_3ohz9n,Sorry in advance for the long post.I guess the issue for me is that Pees scheme works against mediocre teams. Last year we had the th best scoring defense overall we bent and bent and bent but didnt break against weak competition. What did we do when we played talented playoff caliber teams with talented QBs and offenses? We broke. Over and over. We broke against the Bengals twice the Chargers we REALLY broke against the Steelers and ultimately we broke against Tom Brady and the Patriots. Without the defense bending and breaking last year we were a  team maybe even . The offense was really only completely at fault for  loss last year against the Texans. The defense on the other hand consistently gave up leads in the th quarter and couldnt hang with the best offenses even though we had the th ranked scoring defense. Our defense is like a Peyton Manning offense we feast on mediocre competition and flounder against elite competition. Its not a recipe for long term success as Im sure Manning can tell you. The only reason we won a super bowl with Pees as the coordinator is because we had guys like Ray Lewis Ed Reed etc.. and even then we STILL almost gave that game away.The point? If you evaluate JUST the talent on our defense we are loaded. At every level. The defensive line the linebackers Jimmy Smith Will Hill. These guys from a talent perspective are capable of fielding a top  defense across the board. The problem is the scheme asks them to back off play soft give up yardage and then clamp down. Last year against good teams it didnt work this year shocker its not working against good teams and as of this past sunday its not working against bad teams either.,ravens,cvxe98w,9,t5_2s1w8

I didnt look into what happens in the later rounds.Its definitely a good point about De Costa in the article and Ive said before I think our most likely outcome is to use the th pick and move up into where we normally draft late in the first using our nd but its not outlandish to me that if we can move up two spots with a st and th  something then we potentially jump jax.  The trade chart says wed need to package our first rounder with a middle of the third round pick in order to move up two spots and while I doubt wed give up our third I think we have a chance of trading with Dallas.  This is especially true if they are actually looking at going after their postromo QB because they know that Jax and Balt arent going to take a QB so its safe for them to mvoe down a tad and still get their guy so they may accept an underpay from us.  Trading with SD is much more unlikely due to cost and the chances that they lose out on the guy they want.,ravens,d0j532q,1,t5_2s1w8

6936227,0,t1_d12jje1,Second half last season?? what?? He switched positions in the offseason and may play moving forward but he never had significant snaps at FS.He played  snaps against the Rams and a couple against the Dolphins then was moved back because Brooks and Lewis were better at the time. The official announcement wasnt until the offseason he never played any significant snaps at FS for us. In fact heres Webb playing corner not FS and missing a tackle against the Rams heres Webb in week  getting TDs dropped on his ass while playing slot and heres Webb getting toasted by the Dolphins while playin CB in one of the last games of the season.

However the only QBs that will be available in this draft that do fit the mold are Jones and Hackenberg. Two big guys with impressive arm strength and a lot of confidence in the pocket.The problem is that I dont think we will spend one of our th rounders on either of these guys and I dont think Hackenberg will last to the th round.,ravens,d227b9k,2,t5_2s1w8

7289492,0,t1_d26pofa,I Agree those players are old but you have youth behind them. The defensive pass rushers are definitely a vulnerable spot. Also keep in mind the front office has clear a lot of cap space for the next wave of free agency in June. The FAs are older but look at what positions you are filling and I will say age is not a factor with Weddle or Watson or Watson. These are positions that needed leadership help more than anything else. Watson is an insurance policy for Crockett Gilmore and will tutor the very young TE group. Weddle brings more experience at the safety position that was just simply lost at times last year. Again you have young players like Brooks  Elam Davis and Perry that will be growing into more game time. Wallace with six years in the league is not old consider the speed he brings to the table. Entering his eighth season he joins the Ravens at the same point in their careers as Boldin a year earlier than Mason and not to mention Steve Smith who joined the team atter  years in Carolina. The expectation is for him to assume a role and not be the focal point of the offense. ,ravens,d26rlas,1,t5_2s1w8

I think trading up for him at the end of the first round is an interesting proposition but I dont know if its worth it.

7955206,0,t1_d4a7sfy,Daryl was one of the leaders of our defense and consistently made plays when we needed it was still good against the run and I get hes a two down player but we shoulda resigned him because we did not have another option at LB... I think we coulda made other moves to clear that space like cutting arrington or something. Do you think Zach Orr is a good option? How about Arthur Brown? I would love for Brown to show up and do something But Ill reserve my optimism. Monroe has been a  starter when he plays and solidified a position that was shaky since Odgen retired. Oher was hot trash and we needed a player. Do I think they gave him too much money? Yeah for sure but he was well liked and respected by the other lineman. I know for a fact that Him and KO were very close. Thats also another reason other than the money That KO left because he  knew they wouldnt keep his friend Monroe. So not much of a reason to take a pay cut. Also i would rather have have  games of Monroe than any amount of perfectly healthy games from Hurst.  I think Hell end up being alright this season hes had all of last season to rehab and get in shape. Were losing that money no matter what so why no pay him to play for our team instead of another?End of the day I would rather have someone who is good at their job and calls in sick all the time over someone who is there every single day and is complete ass and fucks shit up.,ravens,d4a8n9x,3,t5_2s1w8

8862596,1,t1_d7d5dj6,I didnt have a problem with the babysitting part either. A lot of college athletes dont come from the greatest homes schools or lives. A lot are lacking parental figures or proper role models. Im not generalizing but look around the league how many of these players grew up without parents grew up poor faced tumultuous child hoods. Then they get to college and are pampered and baby sat like no other. They have curfews get free tutoring are given benefits and if they do something wrong it is frequently swept under the rug. Then this same kid works his tail off and makes the NFL. Signs a  figure deal and is an instant celebrity. But the issue is they still were never taught to be accountable to have foresight and they college lifestyle probably made these habits worse. I get it these a grown men and  will never get into any trouble or make poor decisions. But counseling and checking in on younger players making sure they get on the right path and giving them some supervision as they transition into a millionaire celebrity is not a bad idea. ,ravens,d7d5qxc,1,t5_2s1w8

They did pretty well and look poised to get much much better.SSSr and Perriman are effectively rusty and will only get better. Wallace is unlike any receiver Flacco has ever had  Torrey speed but actually catches the ball. Defense did very well against a pretty explosive offense. Big difference I see is having Weddle who is the first defensive quarterback since Reed left. Dumerville will return and Sizzle will get back up to speed. New players are being taught right by vets. The Bills are not a shit team and had every chance to win that game. Many thought they would. They will do well this year. That was an honorable victory.

8932137,0,t3_52jl5e,Lets talk about Kamar Aiken. He played well during the nd half of . I think PFF had him as the nd best WR in the league during that stretch.  Many of us thought that kamar would solidify himself as this teams  WR in .Does anyone honestly see that happening at this point anymore? I dont. Both harbaugh and flacco said they need to get perriman and wallace more opportunities in the future. Pitta still has really good chemistry built up with flacco which means hell get his targets. When steve shakes off the rust hell return to being joes primary target in the slot. I havent even mentioned guys like gillmore and maxx who will be looking to make an impact in the passing game as well. Kamar was on the field for  offensive snaps versus the bills rd most behind SS and Wallace. Health willing i believe perriman will eclipse kamar in terms of snap count at some point this season. I also feel like the bills respected perrimans talent moreso than aikens. They had gillmore on him nearly all game amp rolled coverage to his side as well. That theoretically helped open up the offense. Its too bad the oline couldnt protect joe.My point is that kamars role will diminish as the season rolls on. Thoughts? Does anyone think im overreacting to what i saw during week  and heard after the game by harbaughflacco? ,ravens,d7liekg,1,t5_2s1w8

9148551,0,t3_55k3lv,I remember a few years ago before Antonio Brown really took off and before the Steelers drafted Bell there was a vocal contingent of Steelers fans who wanted Todd Haleys head on a platter They were convinced he was an idiot who couldnt do anything right and didnt know how to make an offense work. Two or three years later the Steelers have arguably the best offense in the league.Im not saying I think our offense will be as good as Pittsburghs under Trestman because I dont think it will be unless we get some huge upgrades but what I am saying is that coordinators byandlarge arent a plug and play proposition. It takes time to install a scheme especially when you only have four players on offense who A. arent rookies or free agents whove never been in your offense before B. arent recovering from serious injuries that took them out for much of your first season and you have a quarterback whos very clearly still shaking the rust off after destroying his knee. Joes missing balls hed hit with a blindfold on before.Trestmans not a genius and if Im being honest I think we can do better but if one bad month with an inexperienced offense were enough to fire an offensive coordinator every OC would be fired within a year. Were being even more impatient than Steelers fans were with Todd Haley and were better than that.Edit A word,ravens,d8bn8v7,2,t5_2s1w8
9151134,0,t3_55k3lv,Theres really two sides to this argument. Stability vs ability.Anyone in this thread that is arguing to keep trestman is doing so for the reason of stability. For long term examples of stability look at the Steelers organization vs the browns. For medium term look at the patriots vs the dolphins. There is something to be said about stability in the NFL. We have had instability at the OC position going onto the th year now and it shows.On the other side there is ability. Marc trestman does not have the ability to be a long term successful OC. Its not my opinion there are facts to show this. He has had  success story in his career and multiple tremendous failures. You know who else that sounds like? Jeff fucking Fisher. While stability is important you also need the right guy to provide it. Trestman is not the right guy and he will be fired. It may take a few more years we might see the Steelers win another Superbowl in that time while we are happy to make the playoffs  but thems the facts about how the future is looking right now. This isnt a knee jerk reaction to one loss while we sit pretty at  the same points wouldve standed at the end of last year. To the people who are saying firing trestman is stupid in one sense I agree because I prefer the stability too and it seems rather knee jerky to can the guy sitting at  losing by  point. But for the long term success of the organization he needs to go. We need to find the person to bring long term stability through the rest of our core offensive players careers.,ravens,d8bz0wr,1,t5_2s1w8

9960543,0,t1_db5oyzo,Dude this is long overdue. Harbs has given shorter leashes to players that have been better than Hester. Hester was one of the worst return men Ive see with the Ravens in a long time. Remember how short of a leash they gave Jacoby Jones? He went from Superbowlplayoff hero to signing a contract to stay with the team and getting cut within the first few weeks of the season. They gave him no breaks because his skills declined tremendously over the past year. Hester got  dang weeks of being awful and no one cares until they saw it in an important game with playoff implications on prime time TV. They gave Hester way too many chances. More than likely due to his legacy of being a great return man.,ravens,db5vuq5,5,t5_2s1w8

He is just OK in coverage but most importantly he has Matt Elam syndrome when it comes to tackling. When Elam came out of Florida I loved him because he laid dudes out and didnt seem to miss tackles. However I now realize he was throwing himself at people not really wrapping up and because he was a strong athletic guy it worked. Well as weve seen players in the NFL are better at evading those kinds of tackles. Watch Peppers closely  he is often hitting people offcenter or missing and wrangling their ankles as he flies by.

11178409,0,t3_5zld00,I actually like both but I dont think either is an ideal fit for the Ravens.McCaffrey is probably the best receiving running back in the draft but we have good receiving running backs and if Woodhead stays healthy one of the best receiving backs so drafting McCraffrey doesnt improve the offense all that much.Reddick Id be worried about from a developmental standpoint.  Hes not an every down edge defender.  He just doesnt have the size and strength to stack and shed offensive linemen.  He either dodges out of the way or is engulfed when teams run at him. So the assumption is that hed play as an ILB on most downs with some flexibility in passing situations to either rush the passer or drop back in coverage.  Thats basically the path theyve taken with Correa.  Maybe Kamalei is coming along and Orr was just that much better but it could be a similar developmental curve so Im just hesitant there.,ravens,dez26dp,2,t5_2s1w8

Were .One of the most intense and dynamic play makers to wear wide receiver gloves Steve Smith retired after three years with the Ravens and  with the Carolina Panthers. With Smith gone and Mike Wallace not getting any younger there needs to be another play maker for Joe Flacco to throw to. The Ravens continue to get plagued with injuries but the part of the Ravens that needs to stay healthy and evolve quickly is their receiving corps. Even without Smith this new corps was able to put up impressive yardage totaling  yards. However with only ten touchdowns that number would be way higher with Smith playing. The ball is in their court and it will be interesting to see what the Ravens do with their receiving corps and if they can make a come back next season.,ravens,dg4mb5u,6,t5_2s1w8

It wouldnt bother me at all if we took Gibson over Dede. ,ravens,dgw4ua2,2,t5_2s1w8

11790110,0,t1_dgwekri,After Wormley I was getting nervous that we were going to heavy on d and thought I was gonna get livid if we went d again. But when I saw Williams get picked I got hyped. Yeah weve got  holes on offense still but man our D is stacked! All we could really use on d is another ILB but if Korrea can take a couple more steps this season we might be alright there too. Like you said though just give me an o linemen and a possession receiver. Then Id love for us to bring in Mangold and bring back Q for a season and go after a ring. A couple more pieces on offense and were making a deep run in the playoffs.,ravens,dgwg5tv,2,t5_2s1w8
11790691,0,t1_dgwhp35,So far Ive predicted the postitions perfectly. Im impressed in myself. First year Ive done it. Cb Lb De Lb. Ive called it. And in round four im predicting an offensive linemen. I hope Im right. Ill be so giddy. Part of me is kind of sad that Ive gotten this hard into football. I love the sport though dont know what it is.  Ut the longer I watch the more I respect every aspect of it. Football goes beyond the players.  The coaching the play calling the free agency and draft. Its amazing the amount of knowledge that goes into it.  ,ravens,dgwij78,2,t5_2s1w8

11795212,1,t3_6897w2,So Humphrey is Jimmy Smith Williams is Dumervil and Wormley is Guy. Thats some pretty lazy analysis. Just directly comparing them to the guys whose place theyre taking. ,ravens,dgx0zoh,2,t5_2s1w8
11795314,0,t1_dgx1ack,He is really raw but has the athleticism to be a long term starter for yall eventually. Just depends on how much of the game he can pick up.,ravens,dgx1epg,7,t5_2s1w8
11795494,0,t1_dgx206g,He was kinda bad in the wk  cincy game too sloppy route running. Despite that he had a big play in both games yd sideline catch vs. new england yd shallow crossing route catch vs. cincy. Hopefully he has worked on his weaknesses this offseason.,ravens,dgx256w,1,t5_2s1w8
11797849,1,t1_dgxbgbu,gtman if i wanted to make a dumbed down post i could just say BPA  times and it would make people like you happyOr if you had nothing of value to say you could make no post. Why do people think they have to make a post? But sprouting bullshit doesnt make a post not dumbed down.gt but I actually like to think outside the box.I dont think you can see the box from where you are.gtTo get to the playoffs you have to win your divisionThats not true.gt if you want to win your division you have to keep in mind who they draft and why.Thats not true either. To win your division you should put together the best team you can. You dont do that by keeping up with the Jonses.gtRavens might have stayed true to their board but I dont think they turned the TVs off when the steelersbengals were drafting.Of course they didnt. They needed to update their boards. But it wouldnt matter if the players went to Pittsburgh or Arizona. It wouldnt effect who they drafted.gtI am not saying Im right Good. Something we both agree on.gtThe draft is what makesbreaks teams and there is a lot of strategy to it beyond bpaYoure right. Its bpa while taking into consideration scheme and how that player fits on your team. But you dont take into consideration what others are doing. Thats how you build a shitty team.,ravens,dgxbrmr,1,t5_2s1w8
