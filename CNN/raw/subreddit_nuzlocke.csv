Really enjoyed that you gave your opinions of the starters before you rolled so we knew you were going to be fighting an uphill battle in the love department.  We had the same thing happen in our nuzlocke it seems no one likes grass starters haha.The audio and video are really nice the only thing id warn you about is the rules were a bit small.  Unless you maximize the screen it would be difficult to read.  Just a warning in case you were planning on making that miniscreen a place for notes.  Perhaps you can use that space as a roster?  Put picture of all the current team members there or something?Looking forward to seeing more from this!,nuzlocke,ch15g4n,1,t5_2setk

If my st encounter is something     I havehad I keep running until I find something new.           b Shinies Clause is in full effect. If I see a shiny Pokmon on a route where Ive already caught a Pokmon I am allowed to catch that Pokmon and it is immortal. Pokmon can only be switched between their partner. If a Seedot and a Whismur are partners they can switch between themselves and only themselves in battle. If Seedot dies Whismur can switch freely. The Pokmon Whismur switches into can only switch between its partner.                  a Relationships can be either homosexual or heterosexual. If I decide that two females are friends and not lovers thats simply how I see them within whatever semblance of a story I imagine there to be.  If I have a male and a female and I see them as siblings thats just how I see them within whatever semblance of a story I imagine there to be. I am not a homophobe.

1257007,0,t3_28hneu,Youre gonna have  ground types at some point but its a nuzlocke and those are all decent pokemon.Id recommend an Espeon. Psychic types can be helpful and I love the SP. Atk and the SPD on espeon great stats for psychic type. Moves are the biggest issue however as is the case for any eeveelution.Of course you could go for a vaporeon decent sp. atk and good hp and remove the gastrodon as youve already got ground covered by two other pokemon. Flareon is not a bad pokemon but good ATK oriented fire type moves arent the easiest to come by in Gen IV fire fang being your best bet at level . His SP. Atk isnt absolute garbage but I wouldnt recommend him for the reasons Ive explained. However if you feel a firetype could really help your team go for it. Its a nuzlocke not a competitive team.TLDR Espeon or VaporeonRemove gastrodon if vaporeon,nuzlocke,cib10z6,3,t5_2setk

Ah well its a solid team anyway my only other recommendation would be a kangaskhan if youre patient enough to get one.Im so pissed off right now. I was playing my FireRed version and actually managed to level up my beedrill and Bulbasaur a good amount...aaaand my game crashed. I was playing it in my DSlite it has a headphone socket and my BF was asleep and because the games stick out the bottom a bit...yeah. Over an hours work down the drain  I ragequit. Still debating whether to go back and TRY to nuzlocke from the beginning of the franchise. Reading Nuzlocke comics does shit to me.I dont see an issue with trophy hunting. I dont enjoy it personally hell the aftergame stuff on pokemon bores me but I totally respect those who take their time in doing it. I get the sense of achievement that comes with it but it isnt my bag. For me games stop being fun when they stop having a plot. Doesnt help that I hate metagaming so in pokemon all of the EVIVperfect team training and all that jazz for other games I just assume itd be trophy hunting. SKYRIM! AAAH! I had that game since release and only completed being the dragonborn with the DLC stuff in...May...June? At least now I can say that I AM a dragonborn which is nice. Now I just have the other  plots to do. Huzzah...No but really I love Skyrim. I cant wait for the next Elder Scrolls game to come out. Although that being said I really should play Morrowind first...That being said I totally get people not being into it and such. I feel its kind of a marmite game everyone I know either loves the shit out of it or just feels it isnt their bag. For me it fills a hole thats been left since I stopped playing tabletop DampD. a year or so ago I have not but Ill go and look it up posthaste!IM BACK AND HOLY SHIT THAT LOOKS AMAZING.,nuzlocke,cvns44o,2,t5_2setk

7183379,0,t3_4dvb8l,Area x mapping means that where theres a set of pokemon in a given route those pokemon will be replaced by another pokemon where Global x mapping means for every pokemon theyll be replaced by another everywhere. Lemme give you an example.imagine on route  you have lvl  rattata lvl  rattata lvl  pidgeyand in route  you have lvl  rattata lvl  pidgey lvl  chanseyIn Area x mapping they could be randomized this wayRoute  lvl  rattatagtScyther lvl  rattatagtScyther lvl  pidgeygtDarmanitanRoute  lvl  rattatagtPikachu lvl  pidgeygtUmbreon lvl  chanseygtMisdreavusWhere in Global x mapping assuming route  pokemon are the same this would happenRoute  lvl  rattatagtScyther lvl  rattatagtScyther lvl  pidgeygtDarmanitanRoute  lvl  rattatagtScyther lvl  pidgeygtDarmanitan lvl  chanseygtsome other monSo in conclusion in area x mapping areas are independent of each other where in global x mapping if a rattata gets replaced by a scyther he gets replaced by a scyther on every route.About your second question thats not possible due to the hard nature of it theres no flag to detect the evolution stage theyd have to be added manually. The closest thing you can do is replace pokemon with others of similar strength based on base stats.One more thing if youre randomizing and nuzlocking be careful when randomizing movesets.

8575132,0,t3_4x8dm3,I take the rules as nonpunishing as possible because thats more fun for me. Youre only allowed to CATCH the first pokemon you encounter in an area so you can accept as many gifts and trades as you want and you can catch a legendary if its the first pokemon you encounter in the area.,nuzlocke,d6dh33b,2,t5_2setk

8865532,0,t1_d7d7k92,Oh god no!!!!  in a row?!?! the odds the odds! Im sorry for your loss thats absurd and enough to make a grown man throw his phone out the window. Damn Natalie is gonna get STRONK as the carry for your team. She shoooould be able to handle Misty and then the grind to bring Zincman up to a competitive level shouldnt be so hard. AND Zincman will be critical for Gym . Good luck!,nuzlocke,d7digim,3,t5_2setk

8894954,0,t1_d7glk3h,While I didnt play gens  and  Id be surprised if they had nearly the diversity of XY. There are rarely dupes between routes  and thats not surprising when you consider there are about  different species in the game.,nuzlocke,d7h1onf,2,t5_2setk

9130045,0,t1_d888mzw,Unfortunately in firered you cant evolve an eevee into umbreon as theres no ingame clock. Even if there were youd have to have the national pokedex to evolve eevee in umbreon.,nuzlocke,d89artm,1,t5_2setk
9159554,0,t3_55pztm,For me all of Gen V. Platinum is nice and difficult because the AI is smart. In BlackWhite its hard because the AI is bullshit lucky. Not to mention the ridiculous wild encounter rate and the antigrinding EXP curve.,nuzlocke,d8d1hfs,5,t5_2setk
9222234,0,t3_56nqlw,Just started one myself beware of Infestation in the first gym it prevents switching out. There are also a pair of trainers with Furfrous that are VERY hard near Parfum Palace ,nuzlocke,d8kzi6j,2,t5_2setk
9285072,0,t1_d8sxvs4,Soul link seems fun that way our teams cant be too similar when we battle.,nuzlocke,d8sy7o9,1,t5_2setk

9577655,0,t1_d9tm4s6,Also if I remember correctly you said that you removed the death penalty the  thing on the forums?,nuzlocke,d9tn3mj,1,t5_2setk
9842891,0,t1_daoe0sg,Yep.  Worse since mine was a blindlocke and I didnt know anything about Mimikyu other than what it looked like I had to go based on assumptions.That uh...that didnt work out.It was almost as bad as the battle against Hau where Raichu killed most of my team before his other Pokemon were even sent out.  Ugh...blindlockes are suffering.,nuzlocke,daqjvgn,1,t5_2setk
9878242,0,t3_5gukh0,Id say its when you earn the Champion title. The postgame stuff is optional you can keep playing a Nuzlocke or default to a normal run.In my increasingly semiblind Sun Nuzlocke Im going to box my hopeful Champs after I win and make a new team for the postgame sticking to the Nuzlocke trinity with them. You may have your own ideas of course.,nuzlocke,dav5p2r,6,t5_2setk
9979084,0,t1_db89fh6,Yeah Gabit packs a little bit more punch than Gible. You already get the first evolution out of the way and like someone else said early Dragon Rage would be strong.,nuzlocke,db8ax1q,1,t5_2setk

10502377,0,t1_dcyi4rt,Randomization is also done using ROMs and is not available in the regular games. You can get a partially similar effect by wondertrading your catches.,nuzlocke,dcyk0ig,5,t5_2setk
10505370,0,t3_5qfmgv,Use save states. And dont accidentally close your emulator lol,nuzlocke,dcyw8n7,7,t5_2setk
10564375,0,t1_dd51ydk,Oh yeah I remember him. And if you didnt have a Steel or Rock probably didnt have Ghost since Sableye is Sapphire and why would anyone use Shedinja for a Nuzlocke it would be difficult.,nuzlocke,dd5lauv,1,t5_2setk

11323137,0,t1_dff35ew,Its been my favorite since then as well. Leaf blade did way more damage to mega metagross than i thought it would. And I got lucky that he used giga impact a few times and gave me a free turn to extra damage.Congrats on winning!,nuzlocke,dffgj53,4,t5_2setk
11341888,0,t1_dfhkz2j,Hmmm this sounds really interesting! Id do it if I had more time but I hope you find someone to try it with!,nuzlocke,dfhl0b7,1,t5_2setk
11421262,0,t3_6302i8,Yea. I always get my team to the same level as the gym leaders strongest pokemon. I believe Lenoras Watchog is  or ,nuzlocke,dfql71a,2,t5_2setk
11686152,0,t3_66qpul,Only if you arent being careful. If youve played the game before you should have an idea what Pokmon appear where. Whether it is trainers or wild ones never send out a Pokmon with a weakness to it. Try to over level your whole team because you never know when a critical hit will take someone out by surprise.,nuzlocke,dgkn5j3,4,t5_2setk
