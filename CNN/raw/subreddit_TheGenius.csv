5056718,0,t3_3k6k2o,Dongmin  greatest Genius player in history  indisputable. I dare you to contend me on that point.        He may well be the greatest reality TV competitor in history but I dont have enough experience with other international shows to say for sure.,TheGenius,cuvixfx,11,t5_2zg6e
5119793,0,t3_3l2iya,The one thing I dont like about the final is that it becomes obvious who is going to win the second game by nature of how much time is left in the episode.  ,TheGenius,cv34l69,5,t5_2zg6e

8856655,0,t3_51ak08,I really love games that doesnt need a strong alliance to win the game yet instead its more about how you outplay the opponents. I really enjoy watching Seed Poker and Horror Race because of that and its definitely something Im interested in trying out.Other games that need some high understanding of the game only get enjoyable on my rewatch I really like the idea of Middle Race and how the different characters play out. Although it is difficult to understand the order mechanics and how each character interacts with one another I like how certain characters can work nicely together to gain control even though they are the minority. One of the games Id be interested to play if it comes out as a legit board game.And I enjoy some others that you have stated as well!,TheGenius,d7cg0s4,1,t5_2zg6e

10192074,0,t3_5lxbdc,Asol watching how former Haesung alliance  Kyungryul squabbles between each other was funny I really thought Seohyun would have aced this challenge with her photographic memory  apparently not. MJ did much better than her. If finale brain game will be memory oriented they can just ditch all of the brains and take MJ instead and add Macho for his money.Also that challenge was made a complete joke by gusts of wind. Madong being on the right and taking most of the wind basically decided the outcome more than any skill.Producers should have provided a tent instead of making this a complete randomfest. Another problem with this challenge is that it gives bigger village advantage which goes against all other main matches.Insun is actually good with politicking you can definitely see how she was able to hang in Nopdong for so long. She tried to use the rift between Byungkwan and Haesung to her advantage.I think Byungkwan eliminated Seohyun because she is a known value at this point while Insun can still be useful. Though her only power is ability to hit or not to hit the gong during rebellions so i am not sure how is that helping Byunkwan. Maybe he can use her a deciding vote when Kyungryul rebels against other leader or talk her out of hitting it against him.,TheGenius,dbzbtiy,3,t5_2zg6e
10808692,0,t1_dds2y3q,I couldnt stand Byungkwan! I was happy Madong won because I loved Injik and Kyungryul who loves his wife of  years. But then I remembered how Byungkwan had by far the most amount of money and it left a sour taste in my mouth. My ideal ending would have been Asol staying and Byungkwan going with Madong going on to win. I really grew to love Asol and it was hard for me to watch him on the treadmill  I did like MJ and Pharoh but I agree blacklisting Sahyuk was the nail in their coffin.I think it would have been cool if instead of the eliminated players winnings disappearing in the last episode they secretly could give it to a player or multiple players still in the game. If they won they would get it and if they lost then it disappeared. ,TheGenius,dduu9hu,6,t5_2zg6e
