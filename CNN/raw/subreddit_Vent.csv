5337812,0,t3_3o4iqi,Wow Im sorry youve had to go through all of this. Try searching around your area for outreach programs or anything that can help you without the repercussion of jail or more fines thrown on your already heavy load. Go to a church for some food they usually have something or can point you in the right direction to get you some pantry basics. Take a mental health day just try your best to relax and not beat yourself up. Make it simple just what you love to feel comfortable. I know its challenging. Do you have any friends or family that are mechanically inclined and you know are trustworthy? Id try asking them if they can help you out with your vehicle parts can be found in salvage yards at a great discount. I wish you luck on getting through everything and I hope that things start to get better. Never ever feel like you cant ask for help there are good people out there that will help without a hidden agenda. Be safe and take care of yourself youve got nieces and nephews to keep you going.

Theres a guy whos very special to me and just ignores me...and I had the same reaction to feel angry at him. Its ironic how that works. I also feel kind of ruined for the future because there was another guy I was interested in but he fails in comparison and I feel like I cant date someone knowing Id probably be happier with someone else. It would have been better if I had never met this guy...I hope you are able to find a girlfriend eventually. Good luck.,Vent,czhg341,1,t5_2qimv

8668523,0,t1_d6jlpwu,I cant do that now.I fucked up.In the time that I wrote this things were really bad. So bad that I just gave up and acted on impulsewhich I rarely do. To make a long story short we had a little brawl in the house I didnt think much of it and expected it to just be over and wed go about our ways but then he called the cops on me. I went to court and had to agree to not be aggressive threatening or make anyone else do the dirty work for me and other things which seems like overkill for pretty much a standard argument. Now I legally cant say anything even mildly agreessive towards him   because of this intervention order placed on me. I cant do anything or I can be detained and become a criminal and of course legally never allowed into the house again nor talk to him again even if he is talking to me over the phone. Just now he threatened to call the cops because I disagreed with him. He must really hate my guts. All I know is things are like maybe x worse now than when I made that post. Cause if I even disagree with him like I normally do he can now claim it as me being aggressive and Ill be kicked out itll go on my record and ill be a fucking criminal forever. Current moral of the story If you have anal parents get it out of your system before you turn  because as soon as you do youre eligible for all sorts of bullshit even if you thought it was the worst now.Real Moral of the story help me figure out how to occupy myself so I wont argue with my dad ever again.,Vent,d6p6owp,1,t5_2qimv

9819451,0,t3_5fr5rh,Wow that kind of casual carelessness is just hard to be charitable about. Wtf. Especially when youve got so much other shit going on. Obviously they dont know but at some point someones got to give you a break right? I have found it very irritating trying to get into a dermatologist in the past. Recently I wanted again to get into a dermatologist quickly and I discovered a few things that maybe can be helpful no idea if they apply to your situation. They had a strong scheduling preferences for existing patients. If you have ever been to a urologist before maybe give that urologist a call because they may schedule you sooner. If your schedule is flexible you can ask to be put on the cancellation waitlist. Maybe they will put you on the wait list before you even have a referral? The person that you called to get scheduled is sort of a God. They have policies and rules but nobody audits them or makes sure that they follow the rules. So maybe if you are good with people you can make something work there. They probably wont just blatantly break the rules for you but maybe they can figure out how to work with them a little better. I hope you were luck turns around for you soon. ,Vent,danhr9b,1,t5_2qimv

Maybe not exactly in that order but Im constantly looking online for places to live and saving up money. I dont know if it helps but thats what helps me.

If you think you require professional help dont be afraid to reach out. Trust me its only the thoughts like im too lazy  its not gonna help me i dont think they care etc. that are preventing you from going which is fearing fear itself.Also you need to find something that you like to do and extend with it. Whether games sports arts tv shows etc. You must have something you enjoy. Search online look for expos communities competitions and meet new people. i know the thought of it is very daunting and annoying BUT its so worth it. Just try it if you fail just keep going. If you surround yourself with people and especially people you have in common with your life will brighten up i guarantee it.On that note im not a professional im not someone as knowledgeable as your average redditor but i need you to knoe that there are people that listen and willing to help you.On that note how was your week? anything out of the ordinary good or bad? whats your favourite game?,Vent,df1s4qz,1,t5_2qimv
