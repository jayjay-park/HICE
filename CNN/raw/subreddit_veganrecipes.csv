1056415,0,t3_266p14,Heres a wee list hope something catches your eye!     These burgers are really easy and yummy  just mash beans mash sweet potato and spices  sweetcorn and bind it all with flour! Then you can both enjoy making them into burgers.    Super easy ice cream  chop up a bananas freeze them then once they are frozen stick them in the food processor and they magically become ice cream! You can add cocoa powderPBnuts or anything else too.    Healthy ice cream no. Get a bunch of frozen berries I like blueberries and put them in the food processorblender with a small amount of canned coconut milk. Add more milk if needed. Instant yumminess!  This salad is definitely super cheap simple and healthy. And everybody loves pesto.  Similar ingredients in taco form.   You could make your own houmous and tortilla chips? Easily and ridiculously good.   Sweet potato puffs.    Samosa tacos.   This mac and cheese is amazing and makes loads of food so its very cost effective.    Super cheap and easy pasta which no one could hate.    Might have gotten a bit carried away there. Hope you two enjoy cooking together.  ,veganrecipes,chodamo,2,t5_2s5ei

1383240,0,t3_29wx3p,I...Im genuinely confused here. I dont understand what isnt vegan about typical fruit pies? I mean I get that older recipes used lard but that fell out of favor years and years ago. Most people use a vegetable product instead. So flour water and a vegetable shortening for the crust. The filling should be fruit sweetened with whatever you like if you feel the need and with tapioca which is also a vegetable product for the thickener. My grandmothers pies won many awards at county and state fairs and thats nearly all she ever used. For her contest pies she did add nutmeg mint cinnamon or other spices but those would still be vegan. Or at least I thought so? This probably sounds really stupid but seriously...this isnt vegan?,veganrecipes,cipo859,1,t5_2s5ei

Anyway nothing unhealthy about pb its just that it is usually pb jam and bread.

Nonetheless I will submit from a greater variety of sites   but again what I do is visit a few sites I like and try to be the first to share them. Many times I am not so I dont just submit them again for the sake of it. And especially on the vegan related Subreddits you seem to stalk I most certainly do not only submit from one source but multiple sources insofar as I can be the first one to do it and not repeat. That is not spammer mentality. In future though you are wellintentioned you might want to ease up on calling people full of shit. Especially when they bother to respond to you with a proper explanation and not shy away from it. Not every single person will fit into your preconceived notion. I also notice that many previous accounts you reported have crappy comment karma scores. Mine do not. And in fact one of my account surpasses yours in upvotes AND comment karma.

11300630,0,t3_61a7ps,It seems you need a NYT account to access the recipe its free to sign up I found it through their cooking app and I dont pay for the paper or anything so Ill copypaste everything here. I made this sandwich and Ill say the long preparation time is worth it. Next time I make it Ill definitely make the corn relish and marinade a day in advance to save on prep time. All Ive been thinking about is making delicious sandwiches lately and this is definitely one I could imagine ordering at a restaurant I mean the recipe is from a restaurant lol. Heres the sandwich I made today from the leftovers minus avocado and arugula. Also I grilled it instead of putting it on seed bread because paninis are like better.  IngredientsA pound block of organic extrafirm tofu find one that is not too dryFOR THE MARINADE tablespoons soy sauce preferably tamari tablespoon minced ginger garlic clove minced tablespoon minced shallot teaspoon minced jalapeo teaspoon cumin seeds lightly toasted and ground  tablespoons honey agave or maple syrup  teaspoons lime juice teaspoon lime zest tablespoons canola oil generous bunch cilantro finely choppedFOR THE GRILLED CORN RELISH large ear white corn large red bell pepper roasted large yellow bell pepper roasted generous bunch cilantro finely chopped Pinch of cumin seeds lightly toasted and ground Salt and freshly ground pepper to tasteFOR EACH SANDWICH ounce slice of tofu large or  small Hass avocado thinly sliced to  cup corn relish Sliced heirloom or good roma tomatoes in season only slices seeded sandwich bread teaspoons Vegenaise ArugulaPreparation. Heat the oven to  degrees. Pat the tofu dry with paper towels and cut laterally into  equal squares approximately  inch wide. They should be just the right size for the sandwich bread. Line a sheet pan with parchment. . In a large wide bowl whisk together all of the ingredients for the marinade. Pat each square of tofu with paper towels then dip into the marinade making sure to coat both sides. Transfer to the baking sheet. Bake the tofu for  to  minutes until the edges are just beginning to color and the marinade sets on the surface of the tofu. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.. Meanwhile make the corn relish. Grill the corn until it colors lightly and allow to cool. Remove the kernels from the cob. Peel seed and dice the roasted peppers. Combine peppers corn and remaining relish ingredients in a medium bowl. Salt and pepper to taste.. For each sandwich spread a thin coating of Vegenaise on each slice of bread. Top the bottom slice with a piece of baked marinated tofu. Fan thin slices of avocado over the tofu the avocado helps the relish adhere to the sandwich. Top the avocado with  to  cup relish. Top the relish with slices of heirloom or good roma tomatoes and a handful of arugula. Top with the second slice of bread.,veganrecipes,dfcwrbw,8,t5_2s5ei
