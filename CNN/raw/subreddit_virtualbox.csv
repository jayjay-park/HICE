3495011,0,t3_307vmr,The installer doesnt ask you but you can change this under preferences. Default Machine Folder is what you are looking for. Note I think it still tries to create a folder in your home folder to store... well... virtual box preferences and such. But the VMs will be elsewhere.,virtualbox,cpqnmv2,2,t5_2s4us
4296768,0,t3_3a7ayb,Yes you can just save the state so it doesnt need to boot or you can shut it down. Remove the installer from the virtual optical drive too.,virtualbox,cs9yvnm,1,t5_2s4us
5516489,0,t3_3qm5uy,Id go the opposite direction of umrkleen and use an Ubuntu Server installation. It is very minimal and since Ubuntu is very popular you stand a really good chance of finding others who have done the same. Im assuming you dont need the GUI just running a CLI program.You might also give a search and see if the software is available in Gentoos Portage or in Archs normal repositories or the AUR. Thatd be super minimal install but also very hands on with no easy helpers for anything.If you need the whole GUI deal Id just go with which ever youre more familiar with or interested in learning.,virtualbox,cwgs50n,2,t5_2s4us

Technically it is is possible. However to do so violates the EULA in your use case. Any discussion of how to accomplish it is strictly forbidden here.Edit To clarify EULA impact and lock the thread as further discussion would likely violate the subs rules.,virtualbox,cx7mvgv,1,t5_2s4us

6058146,0,t3_3yho7k,Unless you got very fancy and have attached a physical drive to your VM chances are that this is referring to the virtual drive which should be empty. Though Im not over your shoulder to check your config so ensure you have proper back ups of the host before proceeding.,virtualbox,cydpwko,2,t5_2s4us
6430625,0,t3_43p850,gt was encrypedLike the file itself was encrypted on the hosts file system? Or the contents of the file were encrypted by the guest?Anyway while your VMs may have been stored on another drive I believe VirtualBox stores some config data in your home folder which was probably on the OS drive. Do you know if you had the same version of VirtualBox installed previously or is this a new version. Assuming you didnt have snapshots you probably should be able to just import the VM as is without having to add the VDI file to a new VM. If not you may need some of those config files from the previous install. Frankly though Im just speculating I havent had to recover a situation like this.,virtualbox,czkgqxr,1,t5_2s4us
