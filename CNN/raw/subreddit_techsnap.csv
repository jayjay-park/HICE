2593243,0,t1_cmwxfjt,Yes these servers store and serve content stored on raid served over HTTP They are cataloged and accessed through a modded hash saved in a db and they are all accessed randomly but semiregularly biweekly maybe.  As it stands its very performant but a hassle to add another server redistribute content and if a server reboots its content is completely unavailable until it returns. The only ZFS solution I think I could use would be clustering which I havent seen a lot of data about. Were talking upwards of a petabyte of data thats randomly accessed all the time. ,techsnap,cmx2obf,1,t5_2skfk
2755361,0,t3_2qtzcw,As I understand it you setup either Port Forwards or to NAT to internal ...x IP.  Then you add a FW rule on the WAN that allows said traffic port to the destination IP which is your internal IP ...x IP.  So there are  ways of doing this.  If you are doing to dedicate the the  public IPs to the  internal IP then I would go with the toNAT option.  Keep in mind if you do the port forward option your internal IPs ...x will use the default outbound Nat rule which will make traffic look liek its coming from your default wan gateway IP.  You would need to change that so that its outbound natted with your dedicated public IP.  Best of luck sirand I think this is a great item to cover on TechSnap.smAsh,techsnap,cnh9tzd,2,t5_2skfk

5350423,0,t3_3oaxzp, Name sighThe SHAppening Related linksPreprint Bruce Schneier blog post Ars article  Hardware setupgt We have computed the SHA freestart collision on Kraken our GPU cluster. More precisely Kraken is composed of  nodes each node being made of simple cheap and widely available hardware  GTX GPUs  Haswell i processor and GB of RAM. Feasability estimatesgt Our freestart collision attack can be done in about  to  days on a cluster with  GPUs or by renting GPU time on Amazon EC for about K US. Basedon  experimental  data  obtained  in  this  new  work  and  the    stateoftheart  collisionattack we can project that a realSHAcollision will take between  and  days on a GPU cluster. Renting the equivalent GPU time on EC will cost between K USand K US and will plausibly take at most a few months. Freestart collision vs general collision attackWhen you hash something with SHA or anything based on the MarkleDamgaard construction you feed it an initial value IV and a message M to hash only the message is under the control of the attacker normally. A freestart attack is where we relax that condition and allow the attacker to control the IV as well. Precisely a freestart collision is a pair MM of messages and a pair IV IV of initial values such thathMIV  hMIVA freestart collision cant be used directly to attack the full SHA because the IV is bytes long and you dont get to choose it.The example given by the researchers is additionally an example of a semi freestart collision where we have IVIV.I dont know how the attackers estimate that a full attack will only take  to  days on a GPU cluster. As far as I can see there is no procedure mentioned for turning the semi freestart collision algorithm into a general collision algorithm.,techsnap,cvvkri4,2,t5_2skfk
