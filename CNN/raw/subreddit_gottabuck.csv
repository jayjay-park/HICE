READ Heartsick by Chelsea Cain   ONLINE Heartsick by Chelsea Cain   DOWNLOAD Heartsick by Chelsea Caingt . gt  Description book Heartsick by Chelsea Caingt  Serial killer stories are a dime a dozen but Chelsea Cains  HeartSick  is a cut above the rest no pun intended. Not only is this novel a real page turner but its also very wellwritten with characters you believe in and sympathize with even when theyre doing things you suspect are definitely not in their best interests. The book opens with Detective Archie Sheridans momentstoolate realization that hes fallen into the clutches of a serial killer the beautiful sociopathic Gretchen Lowell who has tortured to death  people and plans to make Archie number . She drugs and imprisons Archie then begins a brutal and flinchworthy regimen of tortureand this is just in the first chapter. Archie knows he is probably going to die. He counts the days until hes either found alive by his task force or finally murdered. Flash forward a few years chapter two and we discover that Archie did actually survive his tenday ordeal at the hands of a psychopathonly after Gretchen called  and turned herself in. But did Archie really survive? His life in shambles and addicted to pain killers Archie returns to detective work a very different man breaking his work hiatus only because a new serial killer one targeting sophomore girls is on the loose in Portland. The chilling Gretchen Lowell sits behind bars in a maximum security prison but every Sunday Archie goes to visit her and in a sick and symbiotic relationship Gretchen reveals the location of more of the bodies she dumped years past while continuing to torture Archie mentally. As the current serial killer investigation team rushes to find the new murderer Archie allows a young reporter Susan Ward to shadow him and write exclusives on the hero cop who has returned addicted as Susan soon learns to the force. Susan has her own issues Archie his and the imprisoned Gretchen Lowell seems deadlier than ever as she manipulates the world from behind bars.I was surpised at how absolutely satisfying this book was. Id read and enjoyed Cains first novel a Nancy Drew parody for adults entitled  Confessions of a Teen Sleuth  which is just about as entirely different from  HeartSick  as one could possibly get and I wasnt sure if Id enjoy her second book. I did I did I did. And now I will be encouraging more people to go out and enjoy it too. I just looked up Chelsea Cain on amazon.com and there is an interview with her about  HeartSick  in which I learned that she has already written a second book in this series. Normally Im not a series reader but I will definitely be looking for  Sweetheart  when it becomes available.gt .gt .gt .gt . gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt BOOK..FULL.. Magic.. Bleeds.. by..
