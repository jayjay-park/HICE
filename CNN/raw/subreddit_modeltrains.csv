113477,0,t1_cercn7q,Heres a bit from linked Wikipedia article about Garratt locomotive  gtA Garratt is a type of steam locomotive that is articulated in three parts. Its boiler is mounted on the centre frame and two steam engines are mounted on separate frames one on each end of the boiler. Articulation permits larger locomotives to negotiate curves and lighter rails that might restrict large rigidframed locomotives. Many Garratt designs aimed to double the power of the largest conventional locomotives operating on their railways thus reducing the need for multiple locomotives and crews.about | uBladdars can reply with delete.

412534,0,t3_1ysndi,It should work. I live in the US and travel to Europe I have been collecting both HO scale North American and European trains and I can run them on the same track with the same controler. Most HO scale trains use rail DC power around    volts.There are two exceptions to this. There is a small group of European modlers that collect trains that run on AC power that is provided by a third rail. They are primarily in Germany and Switzerland. This would be people that collect Marklin trains. You would be unlikely to find anything local in HO scale AC.The other exception is if your friend uses DCC to control trains. DCC is a digital control system where the locomotive has a chip in it. These are standard DC locomtives with a computer chip added to them. If this is the case he would know how to modify a standard locomotive to add a DCC chip to it. DCC chips are standardized around the world. This case is not a big deal knowing this you could choose to spend more money to purchase a locomotive with the DCC chip already in it. Just be careful dont put a locomotive without a DCC chip installed on a DCC system track it could fry it. There are some DCC systems that can handle a standard DC locomotive and there are some that will not.Just ask your friend if he runs DC DCC or AC.Another post mentioned different couplers. The couplers will be different between american and european models. It is possible to build a conversion car with a different coupler on each end. Your friend may also be able to find American cars to go with the locomotive through an online store.,modeltrains,cfniwvn,3,t5_2r2f7

791435,0,t1_cgtzy5t,You raise a few valid concernsA lot of the tracks are awkwardly drawn as a result of my inexperience with using SCARM.  This was my first time using any sort of railroad CAD other than TRAINZ and I made the drawing in about  minutes from opening the program for the first time so youll have to forgive a few odd areas.  The tracks in a lot of places are drawn much closer than I would ever actually build them my objective was mostly to ensure that the space was there at all.I do not see where you are getting confused about the Timesaver.  My version is an almost exact copy of the original using normal turnouts instead of Yswitches and with measurements for   boxcars as the standard.My original intention was to place the layout flush with the wall as I plan to use motorized turnouts and uncoupling magnets my father is an INC technician and loves nothing more than to make control panels and indicators however we do have space to place the layout . from the wall so it can be reached from every side.  As I mentioned in the original post I am used to working at a scale of  to the foot so this issue did not occur to me thank you for bringing it up.Also as I mentioned in the original post I am not really looking for prototypical operation nor is scenery something that interests me at the moment I have never much liked the idea of a prototypical model because they are invariably unfaithful in some respect or other to the prototype I much prefer to look at a model railroad rather as a very small scale electric railway than as an electricallypowered model of a fullscale railway.  I may go back later and fill in the empty spaces such as they are but any costs and effort will be spread out over time.Thank you for your concerns.,modeltrains,cgu8nhb,1,t5_2r2f7

1164073,0,t1_ci00cjv,Digital is more about how you operate than the size of a layout if you want to run multiple locomotives independently on the same track it saves a lot of wiring.  You can always retrofit locos with decoders so you dont have to make that choice from the outset.Rather than buying a start set you could get a track pack and buy the trains separately.  For N Id recommend Tomix though Kato Unitrack is more widely available.  If youre into internet shopping local availability isnt much of an issue.  For H Trix  again IMO the best train set track on the market dont do a starter pack though I did find this fair price train set while searching.  Another good option is to look for shops that split sets you can pick and mix to your hearts content.  Heres an example of bargain Roco geoLine scroll to the bottom of the page and you could get yourself a good oval for less than .My reasons for strongly recommending ballast base track are various.  If youre setting up and putting away on a fairly regular basis its a lot more robust than the simple sleeper and rail track.  It also helps avoid dust from the floor getting into your locomotives mechanisms.  The points can have motors fitted for remote operation some even come ready fitted yet remain suitable for temporary layouts.Im very happy to offer advice and opinions Ive built three exhibition layouts  H and TT and helped with another few  P EM amp N and have also made ridiculous set ups of train set tracks on the floor a memorable one taking in three rooms plus the hallway of my old house!

1531235,0,t3_2bqoz5,Actual G scaler here one of the best sites Ive come across for online shopping is wholesaletrains.com . Great prices and the site doesnt give me a headache. Basically you have several manufactorers working with different scales on the same track. All G scale trains run on G scale track but they are sized differently. USA and Aristocraft are designed for standard gauge equipment in  scale LGB is designed for meter gauge I believe equipment in  scale Bachmann is either  or . depending on the model and is designed to represent narrow gauge. Hartland Locomotive works is the cheapest of the bunch and designs their stuff to . MTH Lionel and Piko should be avoided theyre either overpriced outdated or just junk. There is also accucraft who makes VERY high end trains in g scale in a bunch of scales. Before you purchase anything you have to decide what kind of railroad you want to get into and then what brand works best for you. I am personally not a picky modeler and typically mix and match brands based on what Feels right but if youre really into exact modeling then sticking to a single scalebrand is a good choice. mylargescale.com is a pretty good forum and the garden railways magazine is a great resource to use. ,modeltrains,cj87to4,3,t5_2r2f7

Unless you remove the gearing inside the trucks to allow free rolling no.   Unfortunately the only other way I know of to control the speed is an onboard variable resistor to allow the speeds to sync somewhat. I dont know of any engines that have that feature. Also when two DC engines are powered at the same time one usually draws more power than the other so its extremely difficult to sync power that way.

11272465,0,t3_60s8nh,To prevent any film showing silvering on decals you can use a setting solution such as Solvaset. Placing your decals on a glassy smooth paint surface will help diminish the amount of silvering that will occur.On the subject of custom decals Im going to copy some information from a previous post I made  On the subject of custom decals theres really only two options when you break it down  You can print your own or you can have someone print them for you.Printing Your Own Decals  Several companies sell Inkjet and Laser Printer waterslide decal paper that you put into your home computer what ever type you have and print. Amazon is a great resource for this.   of the time youll need to have white backing the ink from a CMYK printer as by nature of the way the color system works the inks are transparent and will likely not show up over other colors the remaining  being black. So if using your desktop printer for any color besides black youll want to print to white decal paper and trim the graphic you printed or print to clear decal paper and apply over white on the model.ALPS printers can print white and can still be found on eBay sometimes however they are finicky to get functional on modern computers Windows XP to Win is rough pretty much forget it on  and  the ink cartridges are getting scarce AND since they use ribbons of wax melted into place they cannot match colors outside  C M Y or K without extreme dithering OR a lot of trial and error with layering of color swatches. Im also seeing with a lot of ALPs decals that the white is much more transparent than I remember I dont know if its fading clear over time or if Im just not remembering as well. Either way its a somewhat translucent white.Have Someone Print for You  Custom printing services do exist some use ALPS some use other methods check with your chosen company so you know what to expect for quality of print No matter how long someone has had an ALPS they will be facing the same issues as above except maybe having more knowledge on color layering.  Screen printing has been pretty popular in the industry but due to the nature of the way this process works there is likely to be a higher minimum order and higher set up fee. Also be advised that the screen printing process has not had any magic advancements suddenly show up and it is essentially the same process it has been since the early s this means gradients and fades are nearly impossible to do well especially on scale models. Pad printing suffers the same shortcomings in this area. Both Pad and Screen printing rely on the use of artwork platesscreens and each platescreen can only transfer one color to the decal paper the more colors desired the more expensive the setup process will be some companies even limit the maximum number of colors from the start of the quoting process. Companies offering screen printed or pad printed decals may take a bit longer for your decals to go into production as well.Newer Digital printing methods are out there though they do seem to be more popular in Europe than the United States at this time. ,modeltrains,df9pu6k,4,t5_2r2f7
