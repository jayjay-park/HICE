185273,0,t1_cezbgmy,gt What he is describing is the tendency most scholars have to speak in jargon and show off to others in academia in order to elevate themselves above a faceless mass of pitiful ignorami.Or theyre trying to communicate complex ideas succinctly and dont feel it necessary to recite textbooksworth of material every time they write a paper.  Have you ever read a science or math article?  Can you imagine how long redundant and even more boring it would be if they started from scratch?Also sometimes you cant star from scratch.  It took Russel and Whitehead  pages just to prove  from scratch.Perhaps instead of seeing jargon as something created to exclude people you should view it for what it is a succinct way to convey complex ideas.Is not the vocabulary such as the word Tao itself jargon in the sense that if you havnt studied the subject you really dont know the meaning of the word or what it implies?  What about wuwei? Is that not jargon?  Every subject has its jargon its not intended to keep people out but to make discussion of the subject by those who understand it easier.gt They simultaneously bemoan the average persons knowledge level and do everything they can to lock knowledge up in a tiny circle of elitism.Ive never seen an academic do this.

238199,0,t3_1wubhy,Daoist Priest here.From a priests perspective the most important thing is the spiritual growth of ourselves and the unfolding of our being as well as helping others to do the same.In modern culture we are blessed by grace with such incredible technology that allows us the great potential to access teachings many teachings of various traditions.It would be very fundamentalist and strictly religious to tell you that our daoist teachings are most important. This is not true. We each have different strengths and love for different things. Whether you find god through the Dao or through Christ for example matters not. The best teachings and spiritual tools are the ones that you will use.The Christians are beautiful in their prayers. Daoists also pray. Many think that daoists dont have gods this is not true. In ancient times daoist prayed to one god tian di the god of heaven. When the Buddhists came to China Daoism adopted many of the dieties. The point is that it is apparent that prayer worked for you and it would be wise to acknowledge it as one of your strengths as it would serve you well.I would also like to point out that emotions in our lives is a natural thing. in our aim to free ourselves from such negative energies and states of suffering we take accountabilities for our actions that brought this state. One must ask where these emotions are arising from who taught them and who can let them go. True work happens by our heroic benevolent nature willing to stand up to what emotions we run from so that we can dispel such darkness with radiant light. This is why you will see some Daoist dieties riding tigers... The tiger represents our po animal nature need for survival of ego and body and them riding it into the heavens shows that they conquered their po and act from their benevolent nature the hun.So go forth and be brave!Edit written from a phone...

Which translating directly with the least interpreting I would say to dare leads to death vs not to dare leads to life. This doesnt indicate whose death.

This ought to put Taoism and Confucianism face to face vis a vis for you to see what relation there is and isnt  and in the most direct simple manner meaning you wont have to trust us here on reddit entirely but can go straight to the source.Also I would caution about committing yourself to any belief.  Beliefs are not chosen.  Beliefs are what we find ourselves believing.  Reality is infinitely more complex and manifold than any reduced abstract belief.  A belief however true it might be obscures.

When a foolish man hears of the Tao  he laughs out loud.

But in general it takes time to become proficient and the only path is the path where you devote your own time and intention to training. With the right intention and time you might aswell study with a western master and just spend lots of time trianing on your own IMHO.

The end of this quote floats.If the former i.e. the world wouldnt be the world if it was perfect then this quotation seems like an acceptance of the world as it is as imperfect. In this way it becomes necessary  evil pain suffering joy all of it. One might even squeeze the word perfect back in if the world is seen as complete necessary as it is and without excess. Suffering gets reconstituted if it seen as something other than just a tumor on reality a hemorrhage on the face of perfection.If the latter i.e. if the world was perfect it wouldnt be perfect then I think this quotation speaks of humanity and less about the world. Namely even if the world was perfect  and perhaps it is perfect as a mud puddle in a pot hole  then humans would always and relentlessly seek more and be hopelessly dissatisfied. One might even remember the Garden of Eden  as a metaphorical example one of psychology and not matter of fact  where we were given perfection and were unaccepting.Im not sure which is more pessimistic a world that is by design horrible or a world where humanity couldnt accept the world even if it were perfect.

5965748,0,t1_cy1mnob,You are so wrong I dont even know where to start where did you get this crazy idea?Laozis Dao itself while being non verbal is something which he chose to communicate in words.  The term Dao doesnt belong exclusively to Laozi either.  It was also used by Confucius and many others to denote the correct way of things.I strongly suggest that you read as much of Dao Zang as you can because most of it is deeply connected in theory to lao zhuang philosophy.I know you dont want Daoism to exist in the context of Chinese history and culture and this is a very typical and culturally hegemonic American habit where other cultures can be essentialized mixed and matched and appropriated to fit our own cultural purposes but Daoism as a philosophy did not start with Laozi and it didnt end with Zhuangzi.   If you look at yuanshi tianzun he is the manifestation ofwithout name the beginning of all things.And if you clearly understood Daoist religious ideas you would also know that Yuanshi is formless and does not intercede in the affairs of humans.Yuanshi tianzun is the religious manifestation of the pre birth aspect of creation before beings are aware of themselves.One of the direct goals of religious practice is to go back to Yuanshi which was directly mentioned in Liezi and Lingbao Jing neither of which are religious documents.Daoism is such a huge field of study that it really takes a lot of patience to learn.the interrelationships between ideas in different schools are Daoism are very full and abundant and I strongly recommend you spend more time investing in reading documents from outside of Laozi and Zhuangzi.

Exactly. And this trying to make everything perfect is against the concept Wu Wei actnotact do without tryingintentionexpectation. There are many examples of this in the Dao especially if you are reading a translation with the original Chinese characters underneath. It is very enlightening once you come to understand this concept.What I have been doing recently is reading a chapter of the Dao every day. The Dao is not always straight forward so it doesnt make sense to read it fast like a novel. Read the Dao reflect on it and really analyze what it is saying. Making your own interpretation of the chapters helps as well.One of the most eyeopening chapters of the Dao for me has been chapter . Understanding the difference between superior Virtue and inferior Virtue has been a paradigm shift for me.

7155162,0,t3_4dj1bc,Within the context of early Daoism Laozi especially it is commonly considered that people should be careful about what they eat.   Laozi specifically said that The five tastes make peoples mouths unable to feel.    This has less to do with taste and more to do with mitigating desire.   This is also related to sexuality people should control their sexual desire excessive jubilation and any other activity which can be taken too far.Later in the progress of Daoist thought it became popular for Daoists to be vegetarians mainly because Buddhists had been successful in using non meat eating as a way to promote their ideas about not killing.  Daoism and Buddhism have had a big effect on each other in China.Most Daoist sects today do not require people to be vegetarian but certainly self control is considered as a very good thing.I think that something which might be of practical use to you if you are considering changing religions that taking up a new set of beliefs will not change your life that much other than just offering some novelty and perhaps a new community.  If you want to use Daoism to genuinely change your life you may be better served in finding ways to apply Daoist thought to your day to day lifestyle.  Some of that may be related to learning how to control your diet and mitigate desire to eat excessively assuming that you are not suffering from a glandular disorder.   I have to qualify this by saying that I have had a weight problem for most of my life and have been able to use practices associated with Daoism to improve this situation but have not as of yet been able to reach and maintain a completely healthy bodyweight.   I think the very most important thing for overweight people is that we eat as healthy a diet as possible and get enough exercise.  It can also be very beneficial to workout with weights around meal times and to avoid eating at night time before bed.All of these things dont have to fall under the banner of Daoism but it is also possible to research the Daoist method of adjusting the circadian rhythm in order to better understand how to alter your lifestyle in healthy ways.  In the end it isnt the problem of having a spare tire or not it is the problem of being healthy or not and we should try to take this very seriously.,taoism,d1rgzhh,3,t5_2qhmd

11090276,0,t3_5y9f94,the butcher story comes to mind. as a musician myself this story speaks most to me. remember though that he describes a process of learning and working hard at it for a very long time before reaching his current level of skill. the whole dont think just play meme is supposed to apply after youve already done the work and gotten to a certain skill level. training your muscles and learning the instrument to the point that you dont need to think anymore is the real hard work. Another good skill analogy is the wheelwright in Book  or the bugcatcher. if you want to get good at music though theres no substitute for practice!,taoism,dep2nac,1,t5_2qhmd

11325517,0,t1_dffnake,I dont give a shit what you think I take issue with what you say.Why do you ask?Because  of trans people attempt suicide partly because of people like you slamming doors in their faces and telling them that they dont belong here.Because OP is either hiding their own gender identity or because theyre testing the water for a friend who is afraid that theyll be made unwelcome because they dont feel comfortable in their own skin.You lament in a different post that at least the Buddhists get it right when their entire outlook is based on the compassion and equanimity that you lack.As for male and female sexes being a simple cold hard fact?  Youre wrong about that too.,taoism,dffq8n8,2,t5_2qhmd

11477009,0,t1_dfwrjhn,gtThe universe is not benevolent and all things serve as grass dogs sacrificial lambs.  The wise person is not benevolent and the people serve as grass dogs.  Is not the space between heaven and earth like a bag?  Empty yet doesnt submit moves yet recovers from all its coming and going.  More speech counts as exceptionally limited not in accord with keeping to the middle.  ,taoism,dfwwxvm,1,t5_2qhmd
11612446,0,t3_65pq6j,Very informative!You say Learning to ignore the sensory stimulation of your body is the most essential first practice of Nei Dan but at the same time you say listen to the soft humming within your ear drums and look at the darkness within your head.Why is that? I can suppose that it is because it is important to ignore external sensory stimulation... ? Thanks ,taoism,dgca45q,1,t5_2qhmd
