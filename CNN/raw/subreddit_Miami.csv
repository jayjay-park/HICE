42175,0,t3_1ukhuc,Its inefficient but at the same time it also allows people to have a bigger voice in the decisions made and in government. Tax dollars stay for your city. If for example the whole county just became the city of Miami or county of Miami and we had only one government tax dollars in Miami Beach would be used more for a new park in Hialeah and tax dollars in Hialeah might be used for a program in Miami Gardens etc.. Some people dont like that. They would only have one commissioner and one mayor etc.. So for a money efficiency just one county no cities would likely be better. When speaking having a say what happens in your neighborhood with your tax dollars the more cities the better.  ,Miami,cej8dst,7,t5_2qi76

785846,0,t1_cgtkhh6,Cool. So IMO Ive worked in RE for almost  yrs now part of the issue is that land prices are so high in urban core areas its tough for developers to build cheaper units. When land value prices go up its reflected in the unit price at the end. Exacerbating that problem is that miami is a fairly dense city in that there is no real urban sprawl like you see in atlanta Chicago Phoenix. Its only like miles wide from downtown to doral. So higher development costs equals higher unit sale prices which will make it tough to offer a reasonably priced unit to a middle class family. Thats why families usually live out in the suburbs. Its cheaper and you get more space. Problem is we dont have a big suburb to fill that middle class housing market. Not yet at least. ,Miami,cgtls3p,2,t5_2qi76

975503,0,t3_259uk7,I was at a club  years ago on Los Olas with a buddy. It was the only open business out of the corner it was on as it was a smaller club off of the side. I was on the porch area for  mins. A guy on the other side of the barrier was talking to a girl on my side for several minutes both were white as am I. Her friendblack maybe lighted skinned was sitting next to her looking really bored. I had a little buzz and grew some balls so I walked up and asked if she wanted to dance. She responded no in a nice way and immediately the guy was on my side in my face ready to fight. At that point I realized he was a bouncer. I outstretched my arm to create a barrier as I backed up telling him all I asked was if she wanted to dance. The next second he had me in a headlock choking me and my glasses fell off. I started to black out right as he let go and fell back slamming my head into the concrete. When the cop standing right across the street came over. I told him what happened and the girl backed my story. All the cop said was he saw me fall all by my self. I didnt push the subject because I didnt want the cop to try and stick me with a bullshit charge of public intoxication when he clearly saw what happened as he was there just for the club so I just got a  refund from the manager for a drink that I told him was lost.

1447531,0,t1_cixpnwq,Not discounting the theory but alternatively  many of the big firms have noticed the competitive advantage that these smaller  regional brands have in marketing to consumers that you pointed out will not shop at a CVS. The pharmacy game is a two horse race in this region between CVS and Walgreens with PublixTargetWalmart kicking down the door. In a region as important as South Florida for this industry the slice of the pie Navarro can bring could be enough to swipe the leg from under Walgreens. You can add to that that over time as demographics shift and the older Spanishspeaking generations move on  the Navarro customer base can be easily integrated into the now ever present CVS on every corner. I think the pharmacys know that to stave off walmarttargetpublix they need to be CLOSER to people so they are building on every single corner for this purposesThis could be as much a power play by CVS as it is a smart cash out for the Navarro family EDIT article mentions that an equity firm had a majority stake who were bound to be squeezed out sooner or later as their customer base dwindled. Rowland Coffee The makers of Pilon amp Cafe Bustello was purchased by Smuckers in  Different situation but another example of a big market player recognizing the advantages of a regionalniche brand.EDIT Also look to all the work Publix has done to market their Sabor brand to the latin market who originally saw Publix as a rich people market. Maybe CVS decided to drop the pretext and buy someone who was already there.,Miami,cixq2pq,5,t5_2qi76

Antitransit types will tell you Tri Rail is an abject failure.  Boosters will tell you its an unqualified success.  Ill tell you it has impressive ridership considering how little support there is for it in the form of connecting modes of transportation and how hostile we are to mass transit down here.  I have used Tri Rail for varied stretches of time going all the way back to my high school days.  I found it very useful indeed.
