1119444,0,t1_chqswu2,Ns love micromanaging and they do get overloaded quickly because they mangle paperwork but I suggest if you do this keep a copy of your own paperwork in a file somewhere. All of it. That way when your Nboss tries to rain the shitstorm on you you have proof to contradict her and can make upper management question her finally. ,ManagedByNarcissists,chvjhk4,2,t5_30512
2134005,0,t3_2i14je,There are things happening that may possibly result in the removal of my NBoss.  Ive been offered and will accept my job back full time if the NBoss decides to move on.

2811664,0,t1_cnmzvet,gt Misery loves company so having a terrible manager actually created a more cohesive staff. We learned how to game the system since it wasnt helping staff our students. Hey so hearing you and appreciating your response to OP.  This particular point struck me because I had a really particularly cultlike work environment in a nonprofit and it kept occurring to me that if we worked for a big bad boss I bet things would have been better because we could have come together and felt valid about our anger instead of hating ourselves and feeling like Bad workers for feeling beaten down by the head boss.  Mannnnn it was a really fucked up situation to not even be able to bond together and feel a right to say no or stand up to a fucked up situation because it was so messaged as being for higher good.  Oy Im squirming just thinking about it...,ManagedByNarcissists,cnnoev6,5,t5_30512
3302954,0,t1_cp4r1w0,It was actually. I found out i was pregnant several months before it was my  year work anniversary. Was totally excited but was under heavy stress because of work.  months before the  year  anniversary  weeks along i miscarried. It was a devastating moment for my family and i I dont wish it on anyone  but i felt it was a sign that i needed to leave if nothing changed. Surprisingly she gave me a lot of time off to heal but was up to her antics the following month. It got worse and worse  which led to the meeting and subsequently my  weeks notice. Thank you for reading  and thank you for the advice.  Once I find a job  Ill be able to get help for that. ,ManagedByNarcissists,cp4rhr2,5,t5_30512
3318093,0,t3_2w0gq0,Ive been in your position and the best thing I ever did was give notice. Not only was it better for my mental health but I wound up with a much better job one Ive had for  years now and am a LOT happier than I was back then. BTW if I was in your shoes Id be honest but politic when I gave notice. The one mistake I made when I left my horrible job was to tell people what I really thought of them  as good as if felt at the time it caused a lot of problems for the friends Id left behind. Gah Im glad I got out when I did hope you have the same luck.,ManagedByNarcissists,cp6homc,1,t5_30512
7332677,0,t3_4dv65f,An additional factor workers should be aware ofNarcissists Supply aka EnablersNs crave attention and admiration that allows them to feel superior.  To this end they often cultivate a Teachers Pet favorite person or group of suck ups.  These are subordinates who refuse to criticize the N boss but are always saying things like you did a good job with xyz! thanks for figuring that out for me good idea boss! even when the boss is taking credit for another persons idea.  Many of these are lazy or incompetent brown nosers that have figured out that flattery and yesman tactics keeps them from the N bosses retaliation.  the Narcissists groupies.Because the favorite person or group are enabling the N bosses selfinflated ego  their loyalty is often rewarded by favorable positions assignments extra training etc.  Do not openly bring up this unfair disparate treatment.  Narcissists supply are valuable to them and criticizing them can be taken as an attack on themselves.  Like trying to remove the drug supply from a drug addict.  Just privately document the situation as best you can.Sometimes these favorites are either manipulated or willingly turn into sort of a bully mob against the N bosses enemy list.   The narcissist bosss victims often feel ganged up on because coworkers are either afraid or coconspirators.  Never openly criticize an N boss  Never privately criticize an N boss to a coworker that you dont trust explicitly  they may betray your confidence  If a person or persons seem to always be treated as the favorites  they are probably the Narcissists Supply.  Avoid criticizing these people and always be careful interacting with them as they will rat on you.  Keep your distance from these groupies.  Be aware that coworkers can either be manipulated or voluntarily turn on you.  As hard as it may be keep quiet and document the situation privately.  Documentation is key.  Stress relief is vital because your health WILL suffer under an N boss.  It is not healthy to be constantly picked on at work and have to hold it inside.  You may actually want to get a real boxing punching bag at the end of the week to take out your frustration on.good luck,ManagedByNarcissists,d2bobds,2,t5_30512
8829088,0,t3_4tkwmq,Family biz are a great environment for the Ns because there are less likely to be punished or suffer any consequences. They will just drive the business into the ground especially if they inherited it from grandpa. Why would you want to work for somebody like that? I mean I know you need a job but I would keep my eye out for any exit opportunity whatsoever.,ManagedByNarcissists,d794t0q,1,t5_30512
