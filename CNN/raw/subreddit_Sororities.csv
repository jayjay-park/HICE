You might transfer to a school that has your organization and you might not.  Even if your new school has a chapter of your sorority you might not like the chapter culture! ,Sororities,ceo37g1,9,t5_2v0zk

490943,0,t3_1zooo8,I didnt know. I actually got narrowed to the one house that I didnt want and was extremely disappointed when I picked up my bid. At the time my chapter had a poor reputation and was considered the very bottom of the social ladder. I decided to stay because I was dying to be in a sorority. I immediately started making a ton of friends participating in philanthropies and having a lot of fun but at the back of my mind I always thought What if? What if I did one little thing differently and I ended up somewhere else? My perspective changed entirely when I studied abroad with some girls from some of the desirable chapters. They were beautiful and popular on the outside but catty and mean on the inside. My chapter isnt perfect but it lacks the constant conflict that the other chapters seemed to have. I realized that I wouldve been miserable if I had been placed in that kind of environment. The way you know youre in the right chapter is if youre making friends and growing as an individual. Any chapter that provides that for you is the best fit. ,Sororities,cfw2nr0,5,t5_2v0zk

1436080,0,t3_29kyzo,I wish my advisors would step down a little bit. They control a vary large amount of what we do. In the past it was because I feel like our chapter desperately needed them and theyve gotten use to the control from that period of time. There is very little room for suggestion when an advisor has their mind made up. This could mean anythingdecorations the slate workshops all exec decisions. We just dont have as much input as other chapters. ,Sororities,ciwaf6s,1,t5_2v0zk
1642831,0,t3_2d5dfc,What do you mean basically? If there are any sororities left on her schedule encourage her to give them a chance. They saw something in her after all and she can get the sorority experience from any sorority.  This is probably her last chance to be Greek. I know how she feels it feels like a big rejection. But really its just numbers. Just be there for her support her and let her know that you are there for her. Im sorry she had just bad cuts. ,Sororities,cjm8rmc,11,t5_2v0zk

But as umsobelle pointed out her sorority had a lot of older women and some of the other comments are suggesting it isnt a problem? Maybe its depending on the school or sorority in question if its more age diverseless of an issue?

I remember I would talk to these girls everyday and Now I hardly have actual conversations with them. And when I do get to all they want to talk about is the sorority. And I have nothing to add. Maybe thats why actives and alum dont mix? Alum are moving on with their lives and actives are still obsessed with Greek life?,Sororities,clgjad2,3,t5_2v0zk
2387276,0,t3_2mplil,This happened to several people in my house as we were at a point of transition. I was the same way where my big didnt really pay any attention to me she gave me my initiation gift...  months later. So I found other great people to hang out with in my house many who also werent close with their big. A lot of us got adopted into other families and the person I consider my big was actually in my pledge class but she kind of just took on that role for me. And when I got my little I did everything I could for her and we are super close! Bigs and littles can be great but they arent the whole part of being in a sorority!

2830604,0,t3_2siop1,You need to correct your style of thinking. Youre putting yourself down and all of your sisters when you think like that. I wasnt in the prettygirl or the rich girl sorority but we had some beautiful sisters and some wealthy sisters. And none of them cared about those images as much as they cared about being nice excelling in school and supporting one another. None of the fraternity men cared about that. They would rather have a confident girl from a lowermid sorority than a gal from a top sorority who isnt willing to be herself and be proud of it. Also if you dont want to be thought of as the ugly sorority get the girls to start having beauty nights. Makeup tutorials spa treatments and relaxing time with your sisters can make you feel beautiful. Putting yourself together prior to leaving the house can let the world see your beauty. Wear some makeup or do your hair. Wear nice clothes. And most importantly be proud of yourself and your sorority! Every girl is beautiful and that means you and your sisters are as well!  ,Sororities,cnpu29e,17,t5_2v0zk

This is not to undermine any other posts here but IMO based on what I know abut IUs rush this response from ukovixen is really the best feedback youre going to get. I have heard that historically HALF of the women who rush at IU dont get bidscompared to like  or so at most other big schools. Im so sorry that things did not turn out well.

3086001,0,t1_cohtt2j,ok that makes sense. We do have an advisor I guess I could contact I just didnt know if I should be contacting her with this kind of stuff. The financial thing isnt a huge issue except for me feeling crappy about seeing all that money go to waste... My parents know how I feel about my sorority and compared to my tuition its not a huge loss. Thankfully our dues are relatively cheap compared to other schools. Also I have a home! I havent been staying at the sorority house this semester. I stay at my parents house and commute to school nowadays. Its nice because the AC always works its quite the kitchen is always clean and I get privacy lol. Our poor sorority house is a nightmare to live in  yet another reason why I want out...  ,Sororities,cohv265,2,t5_2v0zk
3175356,0,t1_co1a4em,The point of a sorority is to find where you most belong. If she tried and didnt feel comfortable at a chapter then she shouldnt have faked it. Honesty is a pretty important value for all chapter nationwide. Also I go to a big southern school with a chapter number of about  and we have taken plenty of girls as juniors. Keep your head up darlin! If you decide you want to try again by all means do so. The little Im taking right now has been through recruitment both formal and informal combined a total of four times and I honestly love her so much as does everyone in our chapter. There is no shame in rushing as a junior. If it doesnt work out then hey it doesnt work out for whatever reason. But know that you did try your hardest and that the ambition youve shown is a wonderful quality. Dont lose sight of that.Edit after doing some shameless creeping seems like sporkemon here goes to the same school I do. Whoops.

We had a sister that did something like a year of study abroad or something her last year. International let her obtain alumna status even thought she hadnt graduated yet. That way she was still a GPB but wasnt required to come to meetings or pay for a sorority she couldnt attend. You mention you love what the sorority stands for... If you have to talk to international stress that and stress that you feel you made a lifelong commitment that you dont want to abandon due to some bad apples.

10751349,0,t3_5tthdc,Give it until Bid Day and let your initial disappointment settle  that might be clouding your judgement. If you still dont feel like you are happy BEFORE signing any paperwork saying youll accept the bid I would drop and try again either during informal recruitment or during next years formal recruitment. If you sign the paperwork saying youll accept a bid from those sororities and you get offered one and then drop you cant rush again until next formal recruitment eliminating any informal recruitment chances.I know how it feels. I went the extra mile to learn everything about their sorority and their history and their founders before recruitment. I really clicked with the girls in the room had a connection to their philanthropy and I got dropped after the first round. The truth about recruitment is that as a PNM a lot of factors go into play that you dont know about. GPA class standing the amount of women you talked to the amount of legacies  it could be a million things. Try not to take it personally. Whether you drop or not you can still be friends with the girls you clicked really well with.EDIT a word,Sororities,ddox3s5,15,t5_2v0zk
11266637,0,t3_60qwwz,Hey sounds similar to what I went through! Ill walk through my experience and what you may be able to expectI went on three coffee dates with the sisters and got my bid on the third one. I had no clue if I was going to get a bid or not COB generally doesnt have a set schedule like formal recruitment. I started new member ed right away with the three other new girls and we got our bigs within about a month of joining maybe less its been a long time. Depending on a specific houses national laws or local ones you may be set to a fixed schedule for when you get one after getting your bid. I was at a school with a quarter system and was initiated at the end of spring quarter because of national rules although theyve been fudging it now and pushing that off to the beginning of fall quarter because of final exams. For girls from formal recruitment theyre always initiated at the start of the term after joining if they make grades but I know a lot of other organizations always initiate during the first term of membership. As far as the house goes if it hasnt already been filled up to capacity with members for next year you probably shouldnt have a problem moving in. They want people to move in and fill the house.,Sororities,df92235,2,t5_2v0zk

Our other top house is Alpha Chi Omega and its like a night and day difference between them and Gamma Phi. I know Gamma Phi is the top of the top but Alpha Chi for us has girls who are actually involved in things at school and who have one of the better reputations among frats. So really its beyond me how GPhi is at the top. ,Sororities,dgbjz0p,1,t5_2v0zk
