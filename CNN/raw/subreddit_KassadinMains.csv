6700041,0,t3_47d6vp,If you understand how to play him I dont think hes underpowered at all. This season I have a  winrate on him and like  kda average though only  games played. I had a great deal of success on him during the preseason as well.Id recommend trying to pick him after the enemy mid if you can so you arent forced into a hard matchup. That being said playing at the level I am currently I find that there are very few truly unwinnable matchups. Even if you cant v the enemy mid Kass is still extremely mobile good at farming under turret and a successful roam or two can easily snowball you hard.,KassadinMains,d0ccbz3,5,t5_39cxa
7649432,0,t3_4jy8df,You dont have to build tear on the new kass. Its just a very nice addition to have that basically allows you to say Ima sit back farm and scale. So sure if you build tear you wont deal as much damage. People need to realize that just cuz you get  of your mans back doesnt make Kassadins mid game any better. You can skip the tear all together and do the standard Roa Abyssal build. It wont do as much damage as before but I mean its good enough to get you through mid game. Or you can go RoA Ludens. This is amazing for bird but expensive. Basically if you QE you get the Ludens proc thunder lords proc q damage and E damage in two spells.,KassadinMains,d3bp54v,2,t5_39cxa
8107611,0,t3_4qa5jt,try different builds maybe?tank kassadin isnt great but playablei had a lot of fun and success with rushing magicpen after roaso like roa gt abyssal gt void gt sorcs gt liandries  dcap  hourglassmakes it so you can chunk those tanks or maybe even kill them in spell rotationsotherwise id move on and keep him as a counterpick which is what hes best at imo.,KassadinMains,d4rd9k9,1,t5_39cxa

9391407,0,t1_d96eddz,Well ok I worded that wrong then and probably should have been more specific. I know youre likely not going to get  but without the extra HP I imagine you losing a lot more trades than if you did have them.,KassadinMains,d96fehy,0,t5_39cxa
9636177,0,t3_5d0kxh,Eh Im not dying to have one but I kinda expect a skin for him either this season  or next season. Although I do agree he should get more of a bad ass kind of skin like you said.. Id like to maybe see Project or Battlecast Kassadin Im not suer which he even falls under.,KassadinMains,da0uw0k,1,t5_39cxa
10011837,0,t3_5j1h0a,Well his roaming is fucking awesome. Just roam to other lanes kill them and push. ,KassadinMains,dbckkjz,3,t5_39cxa

10753934,0,t1_ddp57wy,I feel like this season is all sorts of fucked up and I literally just took a break from the game for like a few months. I love the new things Riot is adding the new maps and stuff Replay sandbox. but the state of the game right now is not enjoyable for me at all,KassadinMains,ddp6qbt,3,t5_39cxa
10824329,0,t3_5taln5,VeigarKatarina Its hilarious.Veigar  You literally counter his entire burst combo with  button and then proceed to murder himKatarina  You just press Q to cancel her ult and then shes donezo if she fully commited to the all in.,KassadinMains,ddwgbwa,1,t5_39cxa

11463039,0,t1_dfvavsn,Do you not find morellos mana reset incredibly strong? Maybe I am over valuing that but when I used it it seemed incredibly strong in team fights as I basically could stay full stacks the entire fight over and over.. What about a build that uses both lich and morello? And another question.. do u think deathcap is a must buy? With hiw much raw damage it adds I feel it is,KassadinMains,dfvbty8,1,t5_39cxa
11500888,0,t1_dfzagf8,Idk a surge of new players could just as easily drop a winrate depending on the difficulty of the champion. I think the buffs definitely helped. ,KassadinMains,dfzmj4y,1,t5_39cxa
11563695,0,t3_651df4,As a melee mage gunblade isnt nearly as good. It is expensive gives you barely any defensive stats and also not that much AP. The AD is nice but you dont really need it. The lack of Mana makes it have even less synergy early to midgame.,KassadinMains,dg6r0at,1,t5_39cxa

11570297,0,t1_dg7ht3j,I thought that was free community i can wright my thoughts about the champion and my experience with it.You maybe a salty silver player who thinks he knows the game and deserves challenger right?,KassadinMains,dg7hyxa,3,t5_39cxa
11702698,0,t1_dgmimhp,Havent really played league in a while now how hard would you say it is?,KassadinMains,dgmipro,2,t5_39cxa
11742238,0,t1_dgqqstb,It really depends if they have a squishy supporttoplaner if they do Id go for negatron and abyssal rdnd item and build sorc boots while if theyre both somwhat tanky Id go for mercs.Sounds like youre building Arcseconds bruiser Diana which is fine but I base my build after SDiana whos more focused on quick deletes. Both are fine just gotta find your thing the burst from Ludens is crazy though.And sure bud np,KassadinMains,dgr0gov,1,t5_39cxa
