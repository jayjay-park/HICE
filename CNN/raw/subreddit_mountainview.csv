2394888,0,t1_cm75gqx,Yeah its sad to see. This area has gotten really expensive and its really not fair that people should have to live like that. Its quite a few in that area there too. I meant that there is nothing wrong with that as in these people are just trying their best.Ive never heard of the digital nomad thing before though.,mountainview,cm7ps64,1,t5_2s55r

But at the same time it also means that plants are going to have a hard time hanging onto it because it will want to evaporate off the leaves. So I think fruits are probably okay. Id be more wary if there were root vegetables grown in the area.,mountainview,cpa2i4y,2,t5_2s55r

It was a really crowded area really noisy and sometimes there was blatant drug Im talking cocaine and once heroin use going on in the car next to us. Our landlady was also really shady. ,mountainview,cpxeuz9,2,t5_2s55r

5457348,0,t3_3psll6,The Bay Area is inclusive of everything you list. Its not a separate city. Its a description of the whole region.   MV PA and SNV are roughly identical as they are adjacent to each other. PA is a little more expensive.  Just look at a map.You dont need to physically live in the most expensive cities in the country to visit or have a job opportunity. Almost everyone commutes from another location than where they work.You need to first determine what your budget is then look at apartment costs you wont be able to get a house on craigslist. Thats a starting point to see if you can even afford to be here. You will need to make about K to live okay. Less than that will be a struggle if you dont pick a less expensive city further from Silicon Valley or SF.  Expect kmo for an apartment.  If you get closer to downtown MV or PA itll be k.,mountainview,cw987tt,4,t5_2s55r

10133862,0,t1_dbs6j2v,What about horns installed at the crossing? Those creates much less noise pollution for the surrounding neighborhood than horns on the train because the horn is closer to the place its needed the dangerous crossing so can be less loud. Why cant Caltrain use this at Rengstorff Ave?,mountainview,dbsg3yf,4,t5_2s55r
