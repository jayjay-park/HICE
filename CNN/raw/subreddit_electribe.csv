5277351,0,t1_cvlni00,Maybe but it would sound very different it would be a simplified version.. note the e only has  bar patterns and yes you can half the tempo to make it  bars but then you loose the step resolution needed for drum and bass. The e is more an ambient chill box the emx is more aggressive and has a much more powerful sound. Also the synths are more interesting in the emx IMO ,electribe,cvm8pzl,1,t5_2zhmz
