315838,0,t3_1xp5uk,An intervalometer is critical. Software or hardware  doesnt really matter. I prefer hardware.In addition to the big storage cards pick up a large capacity HDD too. If you shoot a bunch like I do then youll need GBTB for long term storage. Each sequence I shoot comes in between GBGB and since Im a digital packrat I keep all my RAW files. It doesnt take long to fill TB at that pace.Lots of batteries and planning. I do a spreadsheet for every shoot and even schedule in battery changes if needed. Its important to think about those things early or youll regret it in post. Different methods yield different results.Use tools like TimeLapse Calculator or similar to help you plan or just do the math yourself. It takes a while to experiment to learn how things will look in post but preplanning can make all the difference. ,timelapse,cfdi7we,2,t5_2r9wk

Like you say you cant really stop the tripod and by triggering automatically theres no way you can recompose or anything.What you could do is wire a shutter release cable and instead of a button make sure that a metal pin on the wheel connects the circuit.Alternatively you could just get one of those timer remotes or use ML and just make sure you move at a constant pace.,timelapse,ci7m477,2,t5_2r9wk
