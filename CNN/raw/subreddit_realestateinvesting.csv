Actually using the information is what creates experience. Find someone with experience and they can decrease the time it takes to acquire information.Reading about how to ask for owner financing is much different than actually having done it a few hundred times. Each SellerSituation is different and unique. They must be experienced and read about.The other side of that is some people stop learning. My first mentor ended up with  units. However they never had even heard of a Land Trust before I learned about them from another investor. ,realestateinvesting,crns4u7,1,t5_2qnt1

4964999,0,t3_3hgquk,I cannot agree more with what has already been mentioned above. Wholesalers are everywhere and with that you will have to weed them out. To many people will pickup a real estate investing book or head over to Bigger Pocket and get into wholesaling as the quick route into wholesaling and start marking away using bandit signs or Craigslist. The best strategy I have found is networking. Networking Networking Networking. There are a lot of REIA groups and other investor seminars or meetings to attend where there will be a lot of investors and wholesalers all around. I will go to at least  of these a week if I can.I am a wholesaler in DFW aswell and I am always constantly networking with other wholesalers and investors all the time just because someone might be using a tactic that I might not be aware of or just to keep updated with the market. Shoot me a PM and maybe we can meetup for coffee or something.,realestateinvesting,cukdkpg,1,t5_2qnt1

Years ago I did a K rehab which I lived in cleared K in one year when I sold it  down.I have no money and a minimal income but I scraped together  to do a Lonnie Deal with a partner and then we used the  down payment when it sold to do another.We only got  down on the second one so we each pocketed  at close.So after two months we ended up with a total investment of   and a monthly income of  each.Ill let you calculate the ROI.If you dont know a Lonnie Deal is buy a mobile home for cash sell it on payments.We have the one at  years of payments and the other at  years each  a month.,realestateinvesting,cwnad96,1,t5_2qnt1

6292145,0,t3_41r8i7,The largest benefit of a multi unit vs a Condo is that you own all the properties and therefore make all the decisions regarding the property.  There are no HOA boards to tell you what to do.  As an example I own  condos in a  unit place and have been on the board the entire time.  Decisions such as switching our emergency telephone lines highly expensive to radio and installing fiber optic internet took  years to pass through the board despite the near immediate cost benefits.  Just over a year and a half to recoup cost on the radio system alone.,realestateinvesting,cz4uh09,2,t5_2qnt1

A course could help you out but actually there are so many online tools now that you can access for free  it might be better to just use those  your own and atyour own pace. With investing you really learn from experience. I would start off with taking a look at these websites to access guides blogs webinars etc.Bigger Pockets  great site to get advice from people webinars guides etc. Mashvisor  great site for finding investment properties getting data reading blogsInvestopedia  great site for looking up quick information and for understanding the basicsBottom line  I think using these websites would be more engaging save time and help you to actually invest as oppose to a course. ,realestateinvesting,d210dsq,1,t5_2qnt1

8000846,0,t3_4oqm7j,Theres some bad advice on here as an owner of several businesses let me share what we do to protect ourselves from liability if thats what youre concerned about. Do not let the fear of liability scare you away from making a smart decision of owning the real estate vs. renting. You create  separate LLCs one for the real estate portion and the other for your derm business. Your derm LLC rents out the office from your real estate LLC. You have an ironclad lease with increasesto your comfort level built in just like your current lease. This helps you in  ways you are just a regular renter like anyone else and in the future if you feel the need to monetize either of the businesses the deal will be a lot cleaner due to a clear separation of revenue and expenses.Without knowing any numbers which you havent shared its difficult to tell you what you should do but a good rule of thumb is to look at your current rent to revenue ratio and find a property that suits that number. For e.g in restaurantswhich I currently own a good rule of thumb is you do not want your occupancy costsmortgage paymentrentCAMproperty taxes to exceed  of revenue. If you have a higher risk tolerance due to savings or some other reason and want to take on a larger real estate deal because you want to build several offices youd have to look at the current Austin marketwhich is great btw and then make that decision. But like I said its difficult to give you any helpful advice without knowing your revenue current rent risk tolerance and give you meaningful pointers on what size of the deals you should pursue.

8008135,0,t1_d4fvbf1,uCatPsychologist what youre referring to is in the event of malpractice. In that case no assets are safe which is why doctorsother professionals have to carry malpractice insurance. So as to avoid people going after your personal property future income other assets. Heck I carry an umbrella policy above and beyond all the insurances that my businesses carry being in several different states.However having said that think you missed the fact that OP is based out of Austin TEXAS. Texas is a tort reform state where they have a cap on lawsuits even punitive damages on malpractice. KK being a dermatologist I feel like hes going to be alright handling that amount.

8010712,0,t3_4o5ru0,I agree with the other answers. Heres the breakdown of how I would do things  Pay off the mortgage so that your cash flow can increase  Inquire about the lands worth. I dont know your location but is it worth holding onto for a while? How well does land appreciate?  I would spend the inheritance not the entire remaining amount to buy rentals  Continue to look for positive cash flow.  If you find the land is not the best investment sell it and put it toward your real estate investment portfolio. Invest some save some and keep some side cash. ,realestateinvesting,d4gh8rh,1,t5_2qnt1
8792866,0,t1_d74juxf,They have a clause but this doesnt mean you cant do so. I rarely advise doing so but it has been my experience that as long as the bank continues to be paid and you dont wave a big red flag in their face they could care less about subtos.Technically every loan is subjectto if you think about it. You keeping the home is subjectto paying the mortgage! I have a couple of great subtos in my portfolio but I believe a lease option is typically much safer.Regardless OP please spend a bit more time on educating yourself. Currently you seem to be throwing every opportunity you find on the sub asking others to do the work for you. In my experience most good investors enjoy helping others but they at least want to see effort on your part.

So if you have a debt service payment of month they want to see you bringing in mo after subtracting for vacancy taxes insurance repairs etc.  I believe different banks use different assumptions for vacancy and repairs some may say   etc..

10690760,0,t1_ddimw12,Assuming youre not spread out too far with your personal finances and you arent buying a weird deal you should be able to buy something at  or so and I imagine there are still some out there. By appreciation do you mean adding value or do you mean buying and holding and hoping the value goes up? I always advise investors looking for straight appreciating to consider all other investments before settling with real estate. Aside from leverage real estate as an investment is preferred for investors because there are so many controllables but appreciation isnt one of them. Now if your goal is to increase your net worth Id say aim at cash flow and save the cash flow. This would give you cash for incidentals give you debt retirement and youd be able to exchange in to bigger properties down the road as you build equity and cash. Buying at a low return and hoping for appreciation is extremely risky especially with where the market is.

There is normally a big difference between what a rational person would think would be best and what is actually best when people get in to investing. In addition many people have been sucked in to a view that all debt is bad when that isnt the case. If youre buying a cash flow vehicle that you never truly own out right why wouldnt you use someone elses money to help pay for it? In addition it pushes up your cash on cash. ,realestateinvesting,de3b4qo,2,t5_2qnt1

My lease has  months rent as a fee but Ive settled for just keeping the deposit when it didnt seem worth my time to argue they were supposed to leave the property in good condition but didnt and theyd only lived there  months.At month is expect your tenants to be more affluent and OK with a fee rather than trying to sneak out though.
