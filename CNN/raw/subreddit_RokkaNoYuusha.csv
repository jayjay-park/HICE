7274717,0,t1_d249j9a,Yeah their love feels really weird. It seems genuine to him at least. It does seem weird that Tgurneu couldnt kill him as a kid when when he had a bunch of Kyoma and some villagers under his command when later on he can solo  Braves at once volume .,RokkaNoYuusha,d2534n4,1,t5_37bgv
7288809,0,t1_d2646e4,also i find it really strange that Adlet was trained by this old dude on a mountain who no one else could stick around long enough and no one really knew who he was and he some how knew a shit load about the kyoma. but i also think Rolonia is a super complex character and i think she will impact a lot of thr story to come. ps. read vol and then we can discuss more too D ,RokkaNoYuusha,d26osru,1,t5_37bgv
