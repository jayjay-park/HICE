1660258,0,t1_cjodpuf,Thanks those are great suggestions I especially like that theyre constructed like the CK which is so easy to follow.Goals are Stength  definition improvment and general health  although I think the CK will be more beneficial healthwise. Maybe not though.,homefitness,cjofs51,1,t5_2vygu
4516709,0,t3_3a95yk,Do you have access to a gym at school? If you do you have many option. I do a variation on this Phraks Greyskull LP However you likely need gym access for it. Now I actually do it in my living room but I have dumbbells BB and plates and had to modify the routine for DBs. I wouldnt recommend my setup to a broke beginner   I built my collection and routine as a broke student over many years....  Doing squats and deadlifts will definitely hit the rear and legs. Either way check out this post for some good info and plan for a beginner who is using Phraks GSLP.If you really dont have access to a gym check out bodyweight stuff here    and on reddit of course where the fellow actually shows up and answers a lot of questions here rstartbodyweightI actually just wrote up a little post about a super basic starter routine in another thread  ,homefitness,cszz4d6,2,t5_2vygu

10551880,0,t3_5r2f8f,I recommend giving this podcast a listen.It talks a lot about interval high intensity training and the net benefits can be comparable to a much longer duration workout.,homefitness,dd46a5u,1,t5_2vygu
10755241,0,t3_5tq896,I know youve said you cant invest too much into real equipment but I would suggest and am sure you can go to craigslist and find some pretty cheap dumbbells. For reference I got my set for .. and they are all the dumbbells Ill need short of going to the gym. But if you cant afford or dont want to buy any equipment there really is no need right now. At home for absolutely free you can do dozens of push up exercises and the like. A quick google search will give you a LOT of bodyweight exercises but I would recommend pushups widegrip pushups tricep close grip push ups and see how that goes for you. Squats are fantastic as well and I would really recommend looking up proper form for all exercises before you start up a new routine. If you get stuck or stagnate check out darebee. They have a ton of cool little challenges that you can use for inspiration and if youre up for it try Insanity. Its all bodyweight stuff its intense as heck high intensity interval training its gonna kick your butt but you can freakin do it if you wish and make it your goal.More than anything just keep this in mind your body will be changing and there are some days that will be a struggle for working out. For those days just do ita lame workout is better than no workout at all and its unbelievable what your body will get accustomed to but you have to stick with it you have to be consistent and hang in there! Youll be seeing changes and progress in NO TIME and that is just fuel for the fire! Good luck!!!,homefitness,ddpblu2,3,t5_2vygu
