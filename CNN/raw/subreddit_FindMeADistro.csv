10786381,0,t3_5tnaju,Arch might be for you if you can read follow directions and are not an idiot. Sure its not a point and click installation but you wind up with a custom built install without a lot of junk youll never use and if things go wrong youll know WHY they went wrong because you have a basic grasp of the components of the system because you installed them in the first place. Its beyond me why so many people think Arch is so hard to install. Yes it takes a bit of typing but it aint rocket science. Install it in a VM to get used to the process then put it on bare metal.,FindMeADistro,ddsjcd1,1,t5_3ityx

Is that something that can be tweaked? Or is it a feature in some distros? So dont close it. Minimize it same thing essentiallyAlso you mentioned column browsing as in miller columns?

Meaning you will always have the latest kernel and therefore drivers as well as all the latest packages.

You can install the matlabsupport package for better Matlab integration. If you  stay on the current debian version stretch it will be stable for a couple of years so Matlab wont break.Also check octave for a free Matlab replacement.,FindMeADistro,dfkr2wl,3,t5_3ityx
