8772365,0,t3_508dnt,Sounds like a metering problem. However  you are right about the coil.  R coils are only rated to about psi. Ra can go much higher than that. Guarantee it is a major code violation in California.  Not to mention maybe a violation of some federal laws.  Ultimately its just piss poor workmanship.  One call to your local building inspector would likely result in a citation. You have to question whether the contractor even got the appropriate permits.  ,hvacadvice,d727my3,3,t5_3bonx

10027113,0,t1_daqtouf,Hey thanks for the tips. Sorry I never wrote back. I reset the rollout and turns out the gas valve buzzes but the voltage was correct. So i replaced the gas valve as it just sounded like the coil on the solenoid was crapping out.,hvacadvice,dbek6ng,1,t5_3bonx
10525044,0,t3_5qlshb,I am in Ontario. I dont recall the exact figure but I seem to recall that the tank should be  away from the house I want it was far as possible There are several considerations for pipes. There is a high pressure pipe from the tank and a regulator a low pressure pipe to the appliances and a vent pipe for the tank. Usually the low pressure pipe goes more or less directly into the house but the vent pipe has to be directed away from windows other vents etc. and can go quite a distance. In my experience gas guys know the code very well.One tip I always give it to get a combined PropaneNatural GasCO detector for where your appliances are. Most big box stores sell them but they dont know they do. They work very well and alarm long before there is a smell.,hvacadvice,dd14mfd,1,t5_3bonx

11047145,0,t1_dek58ob,gtThe air filters are there for the protection of the equipment not for indoor air quality.I mean ones like this  They go on the outside of outblowing room vents. I dont see how that would protect the equipment at all since they dont affect what goes into the vents. To me it seems like the only purpose is air quality for the inhabitants.,hvacadvice,dek6ax3,1,t5_3bonx
11201708,0,t1_df1bfji,Read the post    the land loard is clameing the part is on back order   for.months     and  outdoor temp is not low     all the problems you stated can be fixed in a day and most of the parts needed are sitting on the shelf at the supply house or in your truck,hvacadvice,df1p6r8,1,t5_3bonx

11793388,0,t1_dgv48gy,Angies list can be a wash. My company is not listed on there due to clientele it can attract. We voted my popular and most trusted nearly every year compared to other local companies. Just like the person at the top of the thread stated any deals are to get into your home to sell something. I spoke to the business owner and changed his mind about discounted tuneups for this reason.,hvacadvice,dgwtjir,1,t5_3bonx
