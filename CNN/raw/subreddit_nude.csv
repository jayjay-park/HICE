4087786,0,t1_crl4vas,I agree very much with what BillyPilgrim said the posing and framing is quite good. Good that the model is going for a natural look although even then the tiniest hint of eyelinermascara will still keep her natural but opens up and brightens the eyes a bit.Just one question did you add grain yourself to the pictures? Because they give me the impression that your ISO was way off and its quite distracting. No critique of course if you like that style.,nude,crm8e29,1,t5_2r3ii
