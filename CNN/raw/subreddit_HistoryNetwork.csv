I have posted sources for you and I do not know what your area of specialisation is.If anything we have a shared history with the African Americans.We in Ireland know the problems that race and sectarianism can cause and and of course anything that challenges the myth of racial superiority with honest history can only be a good thing. ,HistoryNetwork,cf9q0n3,0,t5_2y49w

Where we erred was in giving a platform to a user to unironically trumpet the achievements of Dr. Mengele. Looking through his user history you will find that he had made unambiguous statements of support not only for Hitler in general but his racial policies specifically. The Holocaust is an incredibly important topic to educate people about and the twisted work of Dr. Mengele specifically for that matter.We hope to have a future installment covering the Holocaust and possible even Dr. Mengele but from the perspective of a survivor not a perpetrator.,HistoryNetwork,ch49puw,3,t5_2y49w
