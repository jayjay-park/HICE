1265142,0,t1_cibxlsa,The US never actually assisted or intended to assist the ISIS. The US has been backing the FSA instead.Unfortunately the conflict itself has empowered those more radical foreign groups for many reasons and now the civil war has continued long enough for the FSA allies and enemies like the ISIS to gain the confidence and ability to set their sights to the south.Conflict zones have always created and empowered militia groups to form... Just by helping prolong the conflict the US is strengthening such militia groups. Practically none of the current groups operating in Iraq and Syria existed prior to the  invasion. Perhaps AQ was the only nonIsraeli conflict militantterrorist group openly operating in the Middle East in Afghanistan. The next closest thing to a terrorist group that wasnt a byproduct of the Israeli conflict was Al Zarqawis little cell in Jordan prior to his move to Afghanistan for the US invasion. The two invasions changed everything especially the latter one.,ConflictNews,ciby0dk,3,t5_310x6
1373869,0,t3_29tehr,Well what the fuck.  I thought the Israeli govt was using the abductions to do some raids against targets theyd had in their sights for a while and were ultimately irrelevant to the kidnapping but it never even occurred to me that they might have known the kids had been dead the entire time.  Talk about a giant mess... ,ConflictNews,cioi2r9,3,t5_310x6
