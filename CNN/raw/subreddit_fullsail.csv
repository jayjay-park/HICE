6519546,0,t3_43aaoh,Join Show Pro! I graduate soon in May of this year. It has been a blast I highly recommend it if you are interested. There is a lot of opportunity in show pro to get experience and I have taken advantage of it and gotten my resume built up before I graduate. If you like this kind of work you will enjoy yourself and you can definitely provide for you and a family one day. Just be willing to work hard and long hours! Its a blast! Feel free to ask me any more questions you may have. ,fullsail,czto7ej,1,t5_2s674
