2137955,0,t3_2jfwtz,You know some people on here may know more about this but merely changing a piano to another instrument may just be a cover of the musical composition and not necessarily a derivative. If this is the case you would still need to obtain a license but in these situations theres a statutory licensing scheme where you would pay a small fee per song you distribute. Maybe someone on here can illuminate whether its clear that what youre doing is a derivative or not. Also you could probably find out fairly quickly and likely at no fee a question like this from a music lawyer in the US. Sounds fun hope you work it out.,COPYRIGHT,clbkxkw,1,t5_2qp5r

It is also worth mentioning his business started to pick up since May the time he put up my designs up to give his pages a more professional look. I could ask him to remove it but I am not going to any further legal action.  ,COPYRIGHT,cu4xdek,1,t5_2qp5r

5766136,0,t3_3swkig,Im no expert so dont quote me on any of this but no one else has mentioned anything in almost  days so my opinion would be...   I would say no I dont think you are allowed to mention the game you are copying by name at all.   If you make them look exactly like original pokemon then no. If you make your own pokemon with their own uniqueness to them based off of original pokemon possibly...  I dont think your allowed to do either of these things if you break copyright rules.  Pretty sure you can run a kickstarter for anything....  You can always accept donations for your game even if its free for download or charged but I believe like I said if you make an exact copy of the game that would have too much similarity to the original and would violate copyrights. ,COPYRIGHT,cxbubww,2,t5_2qp5r

6240080,0,t3_41182e,It would be helpful to know where you live but I will assume the US.Cartoon characters and other characters in the US are protected by both copyright and trademark. Having people dressed as characters which are easily identifiable visually will very likely violate the holders copyright and trademark rights substantial similarity test and likelihood of confusion test. Having dissimilar enough appearance will be enough to distinguish your depiction from the original if the behavior is also different ie your gorilla with a tie cant be throwing barrels at an Italian gentlemanThe defense against both trademark and copyright infringement is usually fair use and with cartoon characters it is often parody where the work you are producing offers comment or criticism about the characters themselves. If it does this is a complete defense although you should still expect to get cease and desist letters and hire a lawyer if someone decides that their character is disparaged or used enough to make a big deal out of it. Some companies are more litigious than others. Stay away from Disney.This is a not a full analysis or legal advice and in general the more small time you are the more you can fly under peoples radar. If you expect to reach a few hundred thousand people though I would suggest you be very careful.

10039192,0,t3_5jgvu5,Good question!  When Congress passed the  Copyright Act which was the last full revision the previous version being the  Act they added  which moved the expiration date for works to the end of the calendar year in which their period of protection ends.  This included not just new works ie works created on or after January    under the new  act but also any works still protected under the  act which were in either their first or second term there used to be two distinct terms of protection the second of which required renewal of the copyright.As for why I have heard different things all of which boil down to its much easier this way  easier to know when a specific works protection expires easier to plan a public domain use of a work since works always expire on he same day every year etc.  And this also avoids arguments about the precise time or date of an authors death unless heshe happens to die on December  at midnight I suppose.  This is especially relevant if were talking about an author who died many many years ago since details and records get lost witnesses die people forget and we really dont want to have a whole other mini trial to establish the date of death before we can get to the actual copyright dispute.,COPYRIGHT,dbg4srn,4,t5_2qp5r
10657185,0,t1_ddezadz,Assuming its a case where youve tried to find the prior author and they simply cannot be located bear in mind that copyright does not protect facts or ideas  only the tangible expressions of those ideas. If your site is publishing factual material like statistics or other findings that you originally saw elsewhere crediting that site and stating the facts in your own way rather than copying the artistic elements or layout of the previous site is probably the best you can do.,COPYRIGHT,ddf7gnp,2,t5_2qp5r
10813426,0,t3_5umi0c,Logos are tricky because the graphical components themselves can be protected by copyright law while the overall brand identity can be protected by trademark law.Generally speaking trademark law protects brand identities that are actively being used in commerce. If a company stops using a brand identity and if applicable stops renewing the trademark registration the trademark protections on that namebrandlogo will eventually expire after a few years typically within  years.With respect to copyright thats a more complicated issue. Copyright protection is now automaticwhen you create something the copyright is automatically assigned to you and it protects your work for the rest of your life plus many decades afterward.However this wasnt always the case. Works that were first published in the US between  and  without any copyright notice or formal registration are automatically considered public domain in the US now.Additionally works that were first published in the US between  and  without later renewing the copyright registration as required at the time are also considered public domain in the US even if they were first published with the appropriate copyright notice.So what does this mean?. If these companies went out of business decades ago the trademark protections on the logos have almost certainly long since expired so thats probably not something you have to concern yourself with.. If the company first published the logo with the proper copyright noticeregistration as per the requirements at the time then its possible the graphical elements of the logo may still be protected by copyright law.    However in all likelihood the logos probably werent published with the appropriate copyright notices and if they were the likelihood is the copyright wasnt formally registered or renewed. That is to say there is a good chance the logos will now be considered public domain but its dependent on what steps if any the company took to protect the copyright on the logo design.   Its also worth mentioning that not all logos are entitled to copyright protection since only original creative design elements of the logo design can receive protection so a lot of basictextbased logos have very few or no protected design elements.,COPYRIGHT,ddvbub8,2,t5_2qp5r
