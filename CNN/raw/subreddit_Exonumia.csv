Yes my grandmother passed on about  months ago and every few days I hang with my grandfather and we go through a few boxes of her belongings this is from box  out of like .. so theres a lot more to go through. You did find a bit more than I did and Im glad to see that these are likely real gold and not just plated. The smaller one Ive not had much luck with either. Thanks so much for your help as always!,Exonumia,cfqqay8,3,t5_2xf3b
