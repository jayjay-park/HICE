Many decent apartment complexs have playgrounds and some mall playgrounds have play lands. There are a lot of excellent restaurants all over town.

Crazy but true in some peoples mind.        I guess the best thing for you is to defuse the situation although the court is corrupt it treats foreigners better than the average Chinese. If you have deep pockets then you are looking at thousands of RMB to settle out of court anything less will only inflame the situation The family probably thinks you are loaded.       I personally feel when you go to the police station take some small gifts maybe a few packets of Zhonghua cigarettes even a fruit basket you know something to show the police you appreciate their work IF you do this dont say anything about the case just go sorry about the troubles thank you so much for the other day etc etc and preferably before the family gets there.

I studied in Shanghai last fall and wanted to do some traveling after the program ended but my friends couldnt join so I just up and went to Malaysia alone and it was an amazing experience. From Shanghai Suzhou would make a great day trip its only maybe half an hour from Hongqiao railway station on the fast train. In my opinion theres not as much to see there so a day trip is good. Hangzhou is about an hour away on the fast train and there you can see West Lake and a lot of sites around it. When I went with friends we did one overnight there and found stuff to do on both days but depending on what interests you that one could even be a long day trip. I never made it to Nanjing but its just a few hours by train from Shanghai and there are a ton of cool things to see and do there. You could easily spend a few days there I think. For any of those theyre all popular tourist cities so hotels should be widely available unless theres a holiday going on. Maybe use something like hostelworld.com then you can plan ahead and have a place to stay already booked before your arrival. ,shanghai,ch5zgz1,3,t5_2qyu0

That said I dont think designer frames prices are justified.I accidentally bought a fake compact digital camera from a store in Hong Kong about  years ago.  The guy showed me a working demo model in a store on a main street in Hong Kong and it all seemed legit.  The price seemed like a good bargain not ridiculously low.  I opened the box there and then to check the quality and once I got the power on I realised my mistake.  It was like looking at a mobile phone image from the first mobiles to have cameras.  The quality was deplorable.  Absolutely shit.  I asked for my money back.  The guy refused said there was nothing wrong with it.  I said Ok lets call the police then because this is bullshit.

NO PHOTOGRAPHY signs shown before the performance began and at the end of the interval... EVERYBODY taking photosvideos and laser pointer dude at the back shaming everyone as soon as their screens went on. Never seen that at a gig before surprisingly effective for small venues.The funniest ones were when the person recording had zero shame could see the laser pointer on their screen knew exactly what was going on and would just carry on filming for  minutes until one of the ushers would come down to tell them to stop filming. That happened an unreal number of times.People started getting sneaky though. One girl recorded half the gig in the form of minutelong Wechat messages to another person. I shit you not. She had to keep watch over the button to make sure she was cutting it off at exactly a minute each time. Im pretty sure she missed most of the show because she was so desperate to save the moment on her phone.People man. People. YOURE THERE ALREADY JUST FUCKING ENJOY IT. I can understand taking a couple of photos for a keepsake but what the fuck are you going to do with a shitty shaky poorly lit  minute video with the sound recorded through your phones shitty microphone?

Its not paying for the physical table as it is agreeing to hit that amount on bottles.Anyway in this case it sounds like peter was just an old customer who did not make a res but wanted to finish a bottle he either had put away or that the mgmt was fine to throw his way. Figuring this is a late hour and not to ding cirque  not exactly a huge hot spot at the moment  they probably had some empty tables to fill. Old customers rolling in are generally welcome to grab a seat in that scenario.Anyway bottom line is be careful what venue it is. There are a ton of scams that you might run into but in this case you went to a legitimate club. It would be extremely unlikely they can try to scam you into paying a bill since you didnt order anything. General rule of any table is whoever orders has to pay for that bill. I doubt anyone would bring you two over to squeeze RMB for one bottle of champagne.Seems you were in the clear here.

That is you can get reliable speeds from them and they are fairly reliable as far as connecting to them goes.The second point Id say is they add a few more servers to specific countries. For instance at one point last week UK via Taiwan was the only Astrill server giving me decent speeds. Now I love watching BBC iplayer but China Telecom often throttles and wipes out the UK via Taiwan server after an indeterminable amount of time so it was nice to have the VIP UK via Japan and UK via Taiwan  servers.The VIP servers can fill a niche but yes the improvement in speed wasnt incredibly dramatic but still a factor for you to consider.,shanghai,cod1nz4,1,t5_2qyu0

4886843,0,t3_3hsz9l,Ive never heard anything bad said about foreigners teaching in shanghai. Though the biggest problem Ive seen is that there are so many teachers demanding ridiculously high pay that it drives up the cost of running an english school and makes it terrible business unless ur business model is amazing. There are so many shitty agencies out there that charge students crazily because their overheads are so high paying teachers  an hour or more and students think that higher pay for teachers  better quality... whereas in actuality its the guys that dont care much about money and care more about helping the students actually learn that they should be finding.Source i run an English training company in shanghai... we dont pay very well but  of our teachers are native love working here and our students love studying with us. Most of them openly claim to not care much about the money and theyre all great teachers with lots of experience. Some even Uni teachers. ,shanghai,cuaiwk4,-1,t5_2qyu0

5105963,0,t1_cuk69bf,I went a bit overboard on this answer but I thought the data would be interesting. I worked on the stateair historic data for US embassyconsulates in China. It is covering only PM. so its not a complete AQI picture but is probably good enough for this discussion. I graphed all the cities available Shanghai Beijing Guangzhou Chengdu ShenyangThe graphs are built this way Data is aggregated by month groups Each bar stack in a group represents a same month for different years Each stack is a cumulated number of hours in each of the  AQI categories good moderate unhealthy for sensitive groups unhealthy very unhealthy hazardous and an extra out of scale category for values above  plotted in black. Plotting the data this way provides a clear way to compare same months from different years. For example the first group of bars on the Shanghai graph shows January for years   is not available in the data set.Looking at this data for Shanghai as it was your question we can draw two simple conclusions it doesnt look like the air quality is improving in Shanghai it actually looks like its worse in  than in previous years. there is a clear clean air season between June and early October.I used pandas and matplotlib to create those graphs you can find the script on our public github account,shanghai,cv1gjjb,4,t5_2qyu0

8251683,0,t1_d58wgiw,Yes there is a lot of educational research about these things. Ill leave it up to John Pasden on Sinosplice to say it best in his article The Chengyu Bias gtMany students of Chinese are told by their Chinese teachers that chengyu are important. They take this advice to heart and dutifully start learning. They may enjoy the stories behind them or they may not but these students inevitably realize that they hardly ever come across these chengyu theyre learning in actual conversation or even readings.gtThe fact is that teaching Chinese to foreigners on any large scale is a relatively new thing and as such some kinks are still being worked out. Early efforts at teaching foreigners involved a lot of transference of educational methods used on Chinese children. Memorization of Tang dynasty poems writing out each new character hundreds of times and memorizing lists of chengyu long before theyre actually useful are timehonored traditions when it comes to teaching Chinese kids their native language. That doesnt mean these methods are effective for nonChinese adults learning Chinese especially when basic communication is the goal.If you want to begin recognizing and reading more characters on the the street then put them into pleco and start making word and character lists. But repetitively writing characters is a less effective way to build reading skills. ,shanghai,d590lf5,1,t5_2qyu0

8302376,0,t3_4t4u4m,From my interpretation you can have a license to run a business a license to serve alcohol and food but the premises must also have a license to be a commercial lot not housing. Same thing we have in the UKYou can have a business license and alcohol license til the end of time but if your premises is technically not allowed to be a commercial space anymore which is what it sounds like Mayor and pals are saying then everything else is worthless and totally shut downable. You can take your business and alcohol license to another place but when the Gov decided to reclaim buildings theres not a lot you can do but lament how unfair it is often alongside locals who dont want to lose their homes except in this case its a bar street and many locals arent affected.If your lease still has years on it all you can do then is slug it out with your landlord to get the deposit back and of course get upset that youve pretty much lost that transfer fee.I mightve misinterpreted it but its hard to speculate on anything concrete when it comes to law here. I mean hows the traffic clamp down going now? ,shanghai,d5fcs86,3,t5_2qyu0
8394725,0,t3_4uacyw,I use a US based Discover it card which does not charge any foreign transaction fee. Discover card has an agreement with Union bay that it can be used in places where Union bay card is accepted. And Union bay is accepted in most places. But my Discover card was only accepted in big super markets like Carrefour and Walmart or shopping malls. In smaller grocery stores or restaurants their machines just could not process my card. So I use cash most of the time. If the machine asks for a pin I hit enter and it goes through.   I would suggest you bring more cash. And if you can bring a few credit cards that do not charge foreign transaction fee such as Discover Card Bank of America Travel Rewards card etc. Before you leave US inform the credit card companies that you will travel to China otherwise your transaction will be blocked in China. ,shanghai,d5qvyo8,2,t5_2qyu0

So as youve noticed MM is out of the question with  ping at the least and some losschoke. The best and probably most popular way to play cs in China is to download E which is kind of like the local ESEA. The client is like  translated to English and easy to use while the site is basically completely in Chinese. However it is free and they have  tick servers that dont lag much. The only negative is that if you solo queue youll probably be the only laowai in the game and I highly recommend learning some survival Chinese namely callouts and phrases like drop me.P.S If you want to add me in steam my username is Oulawi and you can also find me and add me in e with the same name,shanghai,dg8rx9i,3,t5_2qyu0
