2074751,0,t1_cl2xcre,Its important to note that The Evil Within is created by Japanese developers. PC is not something that is popular in Japan. Shinji Mikamis career has solely revolved around consoles and continues with this title. A good example of Japanese console developers trying to do a PC port is Dark Souls .You should always be skeptical when a Japanese developer releases a PC title. ,theevilwithin,cl3jo6a,1,t5_2wzi8

2121239,0,t3_2j7g77,Just finished chapter  Playing on the Xbox.  You do keep getting the Resident Evil  Deja vu feeling. Havent encountered any puzzles so far so it has been mostly sneak kill and move on.It isnt as frightening as the trailers made it maybe itll pick up the ante further down in the game  I was definitely more tense while playing Alien Isolation,theevilwithin,cl9geyu,3,t5_2wzi8
2127923,0,t3_2jbsg9,After spending about  hours with it it feels like a combination of Resident Evil  and The Last of Us put into a more horror setting.The controls are a combination of both those gamesMore of Re and a lack of supplies similar to The Last of Us.,theevilwithin,clab0ho,1,t5_2wzi8

2251649,0,t3_2kwk79,Nice. The bridge structure in the background which looks a little bit like a castle the depth of field the sea and the orange tinted sky and atmosphere remind me a lot of of Dark Souls  Majula.,theevilwithin,clq0xl4,2,t5_2wzi8
2286599,0,t1_clts3cl,I had been in the house but completely missed them. Loaded up a chapter  save and managed to get everything more xpammo and mins less playtime. Boss method was practically the same though with minor use of trapsflash bolt rather than grenade and shotgun instead of pistol.,theevilwithin,cluc9lq,1,t5_2wzi8

3517390,0,t1_cpsb4jw,Seraphim is one of my absolute favorite YouTube personalities. His Akumu mode without keys or upgrades has saved me multiple times over and his commentary is great. As for sequels Shinji Mikami has expressed to IGN that hes not the greatest fan of them and if he doesnt make another TEW its because hes afraid itll ruin the series. At least thats what I gathered.  ,theevilwithin,cpt7iq0,3,t5_2wzi8
