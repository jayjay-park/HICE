9210738,0,t1_d8jivkl,Events such as a UHC can do that much more effectively. I doubt Kam or the people supporting this idea see it as a one week thing... Were not talking about a competitive type of play like UHC or factions or a survival map like Skyblock or FTB. Modpacks are basically meant to be played just like Vanilla Minecraft for very long periods of time... At least thats how I see it.I agree though that we need something to bring us together. And thats why we need Events in my opinion...,CruxKraft,d8jj310,2,t5_3cw1u
