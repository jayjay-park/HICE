3505927,0,t1_cpqose6,Great point.  Responsible use of course.  Since MDMA is illegal anyone who chooses to use MDMA is immediately assumed to be irresponsible.  Because it is illegal and it is irresponsible to break the law.  This immediately casts the substance and the people doing it in a negative light.  Despite what good it may do.,mdmatherapy,cprwfk2,1,t5_32a4f

3580845,0,t3_31ba9a,Last I checked the MAPS PTSD studies were using mg with a halfdose booster . hours later.  The MAPS autism studies are doing doseescalation to see how people respond with a highest dose of mg.   George Greer a pioneering MDMA therapist used mg and felt that mg was the highest dose that should ever be used and then only in young healthy people.   In studies in healthy volunteers research labs often use about mg . mgkg body weight.  There was a cool study about three years ago that estimated the probability of desired and undesired effects at different doses.  I clipped out the main image here But the tldr is probability of positive effects peaked around  mg while adverse effects became increasingly likely at doses over  mg.,mdmatherapy,cq0g0sl,3,t5_32a4f
3706710,0,t3_309qub,Could you  describe how was your treatment with MDMA when you took the MDMA and what you do during the seasons?What the doctor says? how he guides you what are the steps etc...Thanks that info is very useful for me ,mdmatherapy,cqesgjr,1,t5_32a4f
3968542,0,t3_35wl11,Several of the factors you have described indicate to me that this therapist even if trained and licensed to work with MDMA is approaching this practice independently of the MDMAassisted therapy manual published by MAPS. As Tenacious mentions that dose is probably too high and certainly higher than what MAPS sponsored studies use. However they are fairly conservative. In his work as a therapist working with MDMA Myron Stollarof talks about usually starting with  and then doing a booster of about half that around  hours later. Another thing to add is that there is definitely reason to be cautious in approaching this treatment. It can be very effective and certainly worth the time but it is you doing the work. It also does not seem like you are comfortable with this therapist and you need to be if you are to fully open up to the extent that you must to truly benefit from this medicine.,mdmatherapy,cr8nbko,3,t5_32a4f
4474947,0,t1_cstsi2v,Im glad youve been thinking of a similar idea! I wasnt sure if people would be into this or not. uhashomon suggested I try to get some support on the other drug subreddits and Ill try that. Maybe theyll have some ideas Im not sure exactly how to put this into action stage. ,mdmatherapy,csuql3k,1,t5_32a4f
4494620,0,t3_3cdp4c,Im fascinated with the possibility.  Lets get more feedback and ideas from here and other areas in Reddit.  How does an IRC chat work?  Someone mentioned online voice and video.  Is that a possibility?  ,mdmatherapy,csx7e7m,2,t5_32a4f
4907649,0,t1_cucybjj,I was thinking about the whole set amp setting thing. Well be in my chamber downstairs for the whole night zero risk to get caught by my parents we can go out whenever we want listen to some music... It was the first thing who came to my mind considering shes a first timer. Thanks a lot for the reply !,mdmatherapy,cud59i9,3,t5_32a4f
5471554,0,t1_cwazkn6,All right so since I took mg I did not reach that dopamin induced recreational state anyways. Having gathered some people and expecting us to become overly social chatty and feel good about everything it was the wrong setting for achieving anything. The social fear is still very present. Would you mind telling how you found a therapist for your sessions Paisley?,mdmatherapy,cwb1jik,1,t5_32a4f
5541907,0,t3_3qy51a,Darn it! Im just seeing this  late I guess. My spouse and I are going to roll together soon for this express purpose. Id love to hear more so Ill post some questions here.How long have you two been involved in MDMA as a relationship enhancer?How to you set the intention of a session? Speak it out loud? Write down things? Put up postersvisuals?How often do things turn sexual as opposed to sensual?Do you need to remind each other to stay on track as it were?Thanks!,mdmatherapy,cwk0wph,1,t5_32a4f

8243649,0,t1_d57w8jq,Maybe we can help each other work through some stuff here.I can relate to this anything that should trigger an emotion intensified my numbness.I had that for years.My experience which may not be your experience was that during my numbness and depression I was feeling an emotion. But I was pushing this emotion away on a very deep subconscious level. If you had asked me at the time what I was feeling I would have said I have no feelings or emotions.The emotion I was pushing down depressing was Anger.How do you feel about anger?Also what is the context of your MDMA therapy sessions? Set and setting etc.,mdmatherapy,d580fhf,2,t5_32a4f

10147818,0,t1_db50647,Agree I think it would be VERY disruptive.  Though I gave up smoking long before I started this process I doubt youll really want one once you are deep in the journey.  ,mdmatherapy,dbu9hor,1,t5_32a4f
