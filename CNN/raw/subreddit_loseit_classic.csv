615014,0,t1_cg9u361,Great Idea! I had chosen not to drink anything but water and some no fat milk on my cereal in the mornings with a cheeky coke zero as a cheat thing every now and then like when I get hit with the waves of emotions that come for the marriage separation  when IM IN A GLASS CAGE OF EMOTION! PYour advice is perfect! Thank you so much ,loseit_classic,cga6fnb,2,t5_2tduc

7825876,0,t3_43224z,Hey I completely understand the situation youre in. Up until a few months ago I was suffering your problem. What really made a difference for me was an advice to cut dairy and gluten from my diet. I know any change is really hard and unfortunately there is no magic potion or formula but watching your calories. Try this and see if it makes any difference. And every day some moderate exercise like fast walking for half hour would suffice. Good luck. ,loseit_classic,d3vp110,1,t5_2tduc
