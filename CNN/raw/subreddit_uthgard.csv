7415224,0,t1_d2kwa7a,RvR combat rewards you with realm points... its almost a nd xp for RvR combat. These are personal. There are ranks and levels LL then LL up to L? not sure where the cutoff is on Uthgard . I believe Uthgard . had RL so instead of L itd be L. At each new Rank you gain  all skills and for each Level you gain  realm skill point. You can spend realm skill points on Realm abilities to modify your character. Examples being bonus stats purge cure all status effects stunmezzrootdiseasedebuffs etc bonus crit chance attack speed. They depend on class which ones you have access to. There are Kindom wide bonuses for holding keeps and for holding relics as well as unlocking Darkness Falls RvR dungeonWhoever has the most keeps has access to enter. There are raids each realm has their own Tuskarian Glaciersp? mid Galadoria sp? hib ... alb name escapes me atm. You can kill allmost with fg of templated level  with proper group setup fg would be much easier  faster so its not uncommon to see fg running them either. Each realm also has a Dragon which takes  fg similar difficulty to TG Gala Alb dungeon. Also the bottom of DF RvR dungeon has more difficult bosses Legion specifically takes fg IIRC. The raids are not terribly difficult but they do drop better than crafted items. Generally the stats are not that much better than can be spell crafted however the procs on them are. Also I didnt mention you cant get crafted rings  gem  cloak  belt  bracers  necklace so those must be drops. The raids drop the best items for those slots generally. Because you can SC on stats to fill gaps its not necessary to get all best items from raids as they wont fit together perfectly and will overcap stats  resists etc. Dropped weapons  accessories are generally best with some dropped armor being top notch. Armor is generally used for SC to even out your stats  fill gaps from dropped items so if you use too many drops your template will become lopsided  overcapped in one area and lacking in others.Ive been on Genesis for a while since Uthgard. dropped so the actual player count requirements may be a bit skewed as Genesis allows bots. Uthgard . will not so fg will be a lot safer especially before everyone is templated.,uthgard,d2l29td,3,t5_2uhdx
9853023,0,t1_dareb4h,Thanks!I remember when Mid healers were all the rage right after launch because of their stun so much so that Mythic putting in some sort of ridiculous immunity timer I petitioned at the time for a different mechanic but alas....,uthgard,darvdv2,1,t5_2uhdx
10085067,0,t1_dbhym1c,I think he means  days played.  Depending on your schedule and how often you play it very well could take  months.,uthgard,dbm3p6n,2,t5_2uhdx
10625960,0,t1_ddbw8lv,I feel so dumb. I only tried a few different resolutions before I decided that wasnt going to do it. Thanks for the answer!,uthgard,ddbzj4s,2,t5_2uhdx
