It makes it easier for us to help you.Youll want Veronica in your frontline. Max her Disturb first then Inspiring. Remove Nana. You can replace Luka with Neraizel if you plan to go monoWhirlwind eventually. Beatrices power curve is the smoothest among all the Sclass strikers in game. This means that she starts very strong and remains very strong throughout the game. Blade is horribly weak early but turns into a similar monster at late game.Replace Veronica with Hildegard. Other than that just look for more solid defendershealers and maybe a good attacking midfield unit like Khirel if youre going Whirlwind. ,soccerspirits,clz9vzo,1,t5_33q81

2920797,0,t1_co02upk,The passive only affects herself but that is the point. Forward passer needs to be fast to ensure they can actually get a pass in before the enemys turn. In PvP you want to get the first pass in so you can take the first shot. In PvE on top of getting first shot faster action speed covers for any accident such as the enemy has the ball while it is your forward passers turn faster action speed helps recover from that. In that sense Micki is a pretty good forward passer second only to Rosaria.My point is that you shouldnt be investing in any other role beside Striker and Assist. GK is a vital role one that you should have as good as possible. Your first assumption is that you can get to the front line before your opponent. Thats a rather... presumptuous assumption unless you have some insane setup I havent read your whole thing in detail but from a quick glance through I doubt it. Seeing as everyone and their mother has an Eden in mid your NariShuVictoria combo will definitely NOT go first.Active block is Lucians key to oneshot survival and thats all he really needs. Very rarely would someone oneshot an active block GK but Fuse Ro is really easy to one shot I always one shot him and Leonard but unlike Leonard he doesnt double as a forward passer for colo. Making sure your GK survive at least one shot gives you a second and possibly third with a heal chance. Besides the opposite is also true. If your opponent is running Kei or Lucian your first shot is very unlikely to score even with a fullsuperb Nari on an active passshot or even Zibroi due to elemental resistance. Also Nari just isnt strong enough to maintain the ball in the frontline not against any standard backlane pusher. They dont need to be fullsuperb just  is enough to take out Nari.,soccerspirits,co03qog,3,t5_33q81

3110702,0,t1_cokd3wq,guess our views are just different and your whole point about how is easier to get dupes in thunder is biased and nothing else I gotten dupes of light characters yet I have yet to get a single dupe in thunder while all my draws were from thunder not event. Talking about  star players.Now your point when telling me that just because i find light more than anything else is not relevant is simply just biased and screams BIASED. Just because some players dont know the ins and outs of the game doesnt take away from the fact that their choice is Light so if your saying your opinion is more important than anothers opinion is something which I will simply just not agree with no matter how you twist and turn it simply because an opinion is an opinion and nothing more.What does Thunder lacking goalkeeper have to do with Bell being a defender? this argument MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE at all. Bell while a great defender from what I hear since I do not own her seems to be inferior to Anael at least from what people are saying and she is Legend.Furthermore in the same order of ideas how would Bell fix any of the issues regarding lack of a goalkeeper. Light has Anael and also has Kei so your point is?Light has Hiro in offense and many consider him one of the best strikers. Sure Silla isnt all that great of an assister but from what I read and seen NOBODY COMPLAINS about Silla being garbage so your point regarding Silla again is lacking objectivity. Not to mention Light can easily take on Luka or Nari thanks to either Sammy or Hiro.In midfield theres Mikael Duke Silla Beth Sammy all of which are considered very good characters especially Duke and Mikael.Defense theres Anael Kei and Virgil all of which people consider top tier. When I originally asked for advice I made a picture of my team and clearly mention I play thunder. Funny thing is people recommended me Virgil Kei Anael Mikael or Hiro and what do you know they are all LIGHT despite me stating I play thunder. Later on I obtained Guinevere and completely love her yet NOBODY said anything about her at that particular time.Funny you bring out the issue of Light lacking speed when Anaels ace buffs action speed of light characters by  which is plenty to go around. Point is Thunder lacks hp buffs and theres little to nothing to do about that unless you use butcher who is pretty god dam awful while the whole problem with speed if there is such a problem with Light can easily be fixed with Anael who is used by and im going to quote a fellow member of this community every light player and their cactus lol.Your argument about Hiro not being light focus strengthens my point about Light being cared for too much even further if even as a Thunder player you choose to use Hiro.I never said giving trash players to thunder what I said was give  star status to more players in thunder no clue where you got the whole give more trash player to thunder. That in itself wont affect superbing characters at all since is not like you can pull any  star characters at  to begin with. But if you wanna talk about trash  star theres Robin Beta Vayne Raklet.Again I do not need to be a level  player in top  people to realize thunder only having   character is utter bs compared to Light and Dark having   characters.Your paragraph about Light having lots of trash  is simply just lacking in the objectivity department. Light has at least   star characters that are great most of which have  upgrade. Duke Virgil Anael Hiro Silla not  star YET Mikael Kei Bech Sammy. NOT TO MENTION Metatron who works wonder in both Dark and Light.Anyways I guess it would be for the greater good if the devs would actually delete some of the  status on thunder characters since obviously they have way too many while the poor light element is underpowered and should get another   and probably get  to begin with. Maybe than it will be obvious to everyone to how stupid unbalanced the elements are in this game. being sarcastic here because it seems to me some people not necesarily you would actually love that especially since Lights weakness is thunderFurthermore your post only addressed a couple words to the whole Ardor element namely that in the top theres like  bora other than that you post was mostly comparing Light with Thunder which really wasnt the issue since the point was that Ardor is being crapped upon while Light is getting stronger even when a so called Ardor buff comes along.ANYWAYS THIS IS GETTING NO WHERE lets agree to disagree and move on. You arent going to convince me of your opinion and obviously you wont agree with mine. However on my side theres one FACT WHICH is mathematical and math is not subject to opinion. That fact is that Thunder has   star players while Light has  gt close to double the number that in itself speaks for itself how things are standing and how fucked up the balance of this game is in some areas.,soccerspirits,cokf8rk,1,t5_33q81

3156726,0,t1_cooxhra,Skip Kevin because you need a new goalkeeper. Also you only need one assist at top. A typical top formation would look like Strikertotemassist or Assisttotemstriker.Some front totems are Valkia Durkhan Yuri Kiki Guin Veronica. You can use Elizabeth if shes able to get the ball first to activate her passive Dragons wisdomsMid formation usually goes attackertankassistattacker. I think Jury is a defender but she can stay there until you find an attacker.As for your back line Im not sure if theres a standard formation but you have a really good pool of cards. Anael is one of the best defenders super play and punishment Mimi youd max coexistent and breakthrough pass to heal and Mira because she heals and has a great passive honorable vowNew backline AnaelMimiMiraFuseRo is good for now but youll need a new goalkeeper suck as Kei Zibroi Jin and Lucian.

3231970,0,t1_cowzfd8,Sorry refuse. He is out of the team moment I get Lia or if  Tyler is any good tbh I just do not feel it despite how many others love him. The one thing I dont budge on not sure why I even have him in back line atm tbh he does nothing and feels useless no matter where I put him. He has slowly drifted higher and higher up my hated units list which has caused him to go further and further back on my units line.Edit Note I feel Kevin is AMAZING as a unit and helps out a lot of teams. I have never seen him help my front line out though. Bora and Nari are both highly durable and can take the hit or two before their turn comes up if they ARE beaten to the punch rare as Bora is quite fast on her own and he offers quite close to nothing else. Them Jacob level stats...Unlike Yuri who can take the ENTIRE ENEMY LINE beating on her for several rounds and shrug it off while giving great buffs.,soccerspirits,cowzzen,1,t5_33q81

When I started my first  draw was Bora and I have drawn six more Bora since. I got Kevin on my first mileage drew one more and just over the last three days drew him three times from three crystal draws. I could not refuse the signs that my stubbornness was wrong the game DEMANDS that I Kevin! Also I have zero unique stones and only two  Ardor stones. The game is throwing Light and WW  stones at me like candy but almost nothing I can actually use Edit  Oh if it influences anything my bonuses are pretty one sided. Bora is  Victoria is  Elise is .

The guild I was in was really good and we became very close. Weve chosen to stop playing early bc why bother? Weve moved on to Chain Chronicles and I play SS Final Fantasy Record Keeper and Age of Ishtaria now. A smaller group is trying to make a new app for it though. But really Zynga is shooting themselves in the foot by forcing their FP games to become PP to get any sort of good rewards or any type of advantage. Thats why I love SS.

Im currently working on replacing Enthia with Anael.Idea  Monowhirlwind  would replace Nari for Neraizel  The issue I see here is that Swimsuit Qiyou isnt fully superbed and that I lack other whirlwind staples such as Princess Merian Magnus Jin etc. I have Kirin but with an invested Beatrice I dont think Id be switching to Kirin any time soon.Idea  Ardorlight   Super rough I also have Latios and Uriel for strikers. Main issue is that no Kei Kevin Lucian legendaries etc.For now Im leaning towards just passing on Neraizel and finding a better GK or just buffing my midline since my midline is what makes or breaks my PVP atm.

3990661,0,t1_crarvc3,Eden has heard your plea. Also holy Eden that is a lot of legendary. Instead of looking at what you have we need to consider what you can obtain. You should pick him up if you are someone who is capable of obtaining GP on a regular basis this is just my guideline but about gp a week. Simply having options good ones is the basis to a strong team.Mikael is a powerful light totem which double as an attacker key point here though often used offcolour. Because Army Mark is just insane. If we look at your current set up you already have Yuri who does the same task in the back line. In mid you can consider replacing Elizabeth because she wont offer the same utility or Malcolm hes a top tier attacker but not in this team look at all your WW!!. Sure shes easy to superb and synergizes with Neraziel a bit. But unfortunately superplay steal is one of those it sounds great on paper kind of thing. Most of the time Elizabeth will crash into an attacker and just get melted.TLDR Just grab him if you can afford to generate enough GP a day to pick up gatekeepers. | | | ||||||LeventorBeatrice|Kiki|Neraziel||Khirel|Linmay|ElizabethEden?Qiyou||Bell|Avnore|MagnusMikaelYuri|| |Kei| |assist MikaelYuriMagnusWith my best judgement this is what I would consider doing. BeatriceNeraKiki is your typical high power high speed WW frontline. LeventorKikiNera is a penetrate and steal front line I think this one is just slightly more unique does not make it better or worst. You can argue Leventor is better against Kei in the case of PvP but I consider it negligible. Midline Malcolm seems really random. I mean yeah Lucid  Malcolm chain  free power but Malcolm is a selfish creep in this setup. Not only does he not really benefit your midline his annoying collapse camp wont really squeeze much value for you if you manual for Lucid. So heres my proposal we shove in Khirel to give everyone atk Hello LucidBeatriceLeventor because he does the same task as Malcolm get that ball up there!. Nera will speed up Khirel as well.Next well consider dropping Elizabeth for the same reason. What is her task really? Steal the ball? Ball holder? Shes kinda in between those two. With Khirel giving atk we can consider turning this into a speedy beat down team. This will push us to keep Elizabeth. Otherwise Eden not a troll suggestion will give us that ball holding reflex wall. Linmay  Eden is just a pile of reflex.Lastly we get to the backline. Honestly Bell can go anywhere here. But personally I like to align my ball movers so they can perform more actions in  turn. Lia I would say to drop because... well its a nice long passer but what are we really keeping her here for? Heart pounding is nice for our speedy team but do we keep her for  skill? This is something for you to consider its simply not within my personal team building scope to do so.Magnus why are you there? In terms of speed hes great. When paired with Lia holy backline speed. But your backline has no way to retain hp. Like at all. Both Yuri and Magnus are the kind of squishy that will flat out die to the first shot leaving your goalie v. If we drop Lia we can keep Magnus because we can tuck him nice safe somewhere. If we keep Lia we need to drop either Yuri or Magnus.,soccerspirits,crb6468,2,t5_33q81

4024524,0,t1_crez88z,Two things worth mentioning about the numbers  its not  attack power to damage its .x into GK so that  AP turns into  damage before mitigations.  that crit chance is a lot bigger deal than I think youre giving it creditTaking your pass numbers   for Nari you do  bonus from noncrit pass and  with a crit.. balth gives  and .  Now assume you have  critchance seems a pretty believable scenario given a williamblade with buffs into easier pvp goalies with minor critrate drops  ish.. over the course of  shots nari will crit every time adding  damage.. balth passes will have  crit  not..   damage over  shots.. as your critrate falls lower the benefit of having a nari gets larger and larger.. and naturally as your natural critrate goes UP.. your nari is less and less useful.For you in particular this equation changes because youre running a william.. william has low critrate naturally and is VERY reliant on it with his  passive.. that  pass turns into .x when youre landing a crit and balth is only changing that to .x when hes thrown in.  When you go up against those goalies with  crit resist before line buffsdebuffs youll be glad you had a nari instead of a baltheon.  You skew the issue toward your view by trying to look at the worst case scenario.. youre assuming a crit in which case nari effectively has  bonus and trying to argue over damage numbers.. they should not be equivalent if nari gave the crit rate AND the damage the overtime damage numbers would skew far too heavily in Naris favor and Id be making a post omg nerf nari.The hes a legend response is perfectly valid  in their latest patch notes they very explicitly stated they wanted legendaries to feel superior to their counterparts thats why people like bell and khirel got buffed through the roof.. shu and leventor are lame ducks right now for their legendary status the issue is that they need to be buffed not that all the other legendaries need nerfs.edit also new silla probably actually beats baltheons damage numbers for a number of situations due to her penetration power bonus.. for your william who has  or for somebody like a hiro.. silla may actually be the better option to see the biggest numbers into realistic pvp goalies.. baltheon will beat them when youre testing into little storymode goalies but into a jin or a kei with a bunch of buffs.. silla may be the one you should be complaining about.. and shes just a normal card.. not even gated behind the legendary door.,soccerspirits,crf0xog,1,t5_33q81

Other thoughts Since you have a legendary striker and you dont seem to have a fully superbed  striker before that Id recommend working on Leventor without regrets.

Or another commonly used choice is Kevin or jenuese who both have quick start. It will guarantee that lucid gets the ball first and she can pass to balth on manual only and then he can active pass back to lucid.

Most multipliers scale based on this stat. So even a tiny improvement in the pass stat can have noticeable effects.EE YuriKiki increases receiving pass effect by  respectively. Which is at least half your base pass. In other words it improves the amount by a lot.Certain stones and supoptions increase receiving pass efffect as well. Theres at least a  difference in pass between a  and a  stone. Try to get pass as suboptions for your yellow stones. Like I mentioned earlier every point of pass scales really well.Naris ace will improve the amount of her pass by a chunk as well.,soccerspirits,cs6kvzd,3,t5_33q81

Midline cant break through?At a glance your problem is probably the nonextreme evod Kei and the lack of healing in the backline. So priority is to extreme evolve him then get a healer. Your midline could also use a forward passer any random star will do dont waste GP on them though so Sammy can be used in backline for extra heals.,soccerspirits,cs7j1oy,1,t5_33q81

4836830,0,t1_cu47ae1,Kiki backline is a good idea but she needs to be EEd before shell get her  HP totem. I suggest prioritizing Raklets EE. Even if you dont plan to use her as your PVP GK once EE shell provide an HP and crit resistance totem that Nute will greatly benefit from. For now I suggest dropping Rosaria and replacing her with Nia whose last passive will provide your GK with extra HP. Juno doesnt really have a place in PVP unless Lynia really really needs the extra crit or you really really need the action bar recovery. If you have Mira use her  she has an HP totem. You can drop Nia and Mira later when you get Nerua Raklet EEed and Nute. You shouldnt have a problem doing the ST boss minions match. With no crystals and no gold your primary resource right now is stamina. Dont do challenge mode until after Nute is gone. I dont think you can beat the boss match and without crystals youll need all the stamina you have to farm BP points and you want as many copies of Nute as possible. Pro tip The game gives you  days to trade in BP points but bossboss minion matches are only available for  days. Pace yourself. Also the weekend boss match will give you BP even if you lose but if youre hurting for gold you might want to spend that stamina on the weekend swirlies. Speaking of gold dont spend the gold on scouts. Remember that it costs K gold to EE a unit and K gold to evolve!Final tip if you havent done so yet use your battle balls today to climb out of bronze. League does give a nice chunk of gold if youre struggling too much in arena to maintain streaks. Use todays stamina on weekend swirly matches for the gold. Do exchange  coupons each day for the stamina until Nutes boss event is over. ,soccerspirits,cu47yec,1,t5_33q81

4972461,0,t1_cul71cc,Im honestly not sure why Khirel is CM. Hes an attacker so extremely squishy when attacked and thus prone to losing the ball. His mediocre technique stat also means he doesnt have good steal or reflex so he has trouble recovering the ball. It would make more sense to put him in the back where Sammy is then put Sammy as your CM. That will also solve another problem with your backline penetrating out once the ball gets to your backline. Kiki definitely helps as a stealer but when you have the ball her high steal and reflex dont really matter.Neraizel is also not the greatest passer for Ravian but her most synergistic passers are hard to get so use what you have. Id also consider swapping out Zibroi for Black Tortoise. I think the general consensus is that Zibroi is great in PvE but doesnt do all that much in PvP while Black Tortoise is arguably a solid rd best GK. It would depend on your investment though. What is your current rank by the way? From the looks of it you seem like a fairly new player since you specifically mentioned Khirel being E. That leads me to think all your players are still in their base form. If thats the case focus on getting everyone to max level and evolved.    ,soccerspirits,culbdha,1,t5_33q81

5117326,0,t1_cv2rh6e,Clovers of the entire team count to some extent however clover ace is massively more important in terms of luck.So unless you truly NEED your ace to win a PvE non colo match then use a  luck ace.Elizabeth is favoured for this as shes one of the few cards you can  that actually HAVE an ace skill that boosts your team. could be used for this but you need  cards to get it to  luck which would be worth  GP if sold making it not really worthwhile.Clover teams are generally most beneficial to ardor players the only  cards with actual ace skills are both ardor or late game its whirlwind when elizabeth has full luck but until you have one of those three fully clovered then just have the ace as someone with  clover and watch luck drops keep flowing in,soccerspirits,cv2tv5n,2,t5_33q81

5569280,0,t1_cwnaq0l,I disagree with the Ravian thing yet what I want to talk about isnt whether or not she should be nerfedchanged but what the nerfchange should be if they do it.Ive seen various discussions about the subject but so far my favorites have to be these two.NERF Gravity down applies only to the line she shoots at. This allows Ravian to still function as the striker she is but removes her presence from other lines.CHANGE The dmg is changed to  and moves to her active. Gravity Down is replace with a skill that gives crit rate. I like this one the most because it still lets Ravian retain her unique dmg but limits it heavily and allows her the play as a more traditional striker in the process.Honestly since neither of us are devs this discussion is kind of pointless to start but hey its interesting to discuss anyways. Heck I might just make this a comment of its own just to see what other people have to say.,soccerspirits,cwnf4xv,1,t5_33q81

5706785,0,t1_cx4e5u6,I assume your wet noodle Sharr can deal more than  dmg by herself. Screw that even a well upgraded Lev should be able to do that.Use Jury front right front is probably the best. Jeunese center and striker left. Use Jury and Jeunese to make BT drop HP to  and get you striker to shoot. BT would heal  which is roughly HP so if you can deal that much you can win. To be able to do that youd need a way to keep delivering the ball to the front and give the ball to Jury without ever attacking the goalkeeper so long passer wont work with this strategy.Mind you it is a way to conquer F but should work on other floors that have a healing GK. If you master it Colo would become easier. Although F is something you can oneshot with maxed Sharr but until you can do it with brute force use some strategy.,soccerspirits,cx4hdep,1,t5_33q81

With heal nerf in pvp and two of his skills are healing so that its pretty much unnoticeable. But what makes him usable is his Expand Stratergy to help his bot moves faster and the combination of ESWoMQuick Start keeps charging the ab of the line.The heal works extremely well in pve especially in colo so that hes one of the best players help you to get to higher in colo.

Havent rerolled in a while so I forgetPeople who reroll for legendaries aim for one within their starting draws then they level the account to  to get their second free legendary.You really shouldnt avoid any legendary when rerolling if you get any legendary from draws just rush the account to  to see which other legendary you get from the box and hope that its not a dupe.

5835421,0,t1_cxkex2r,I mean I dont even care since I never bother with the Arena these days. Id much rather spend time ranking up in League using the Battle Balls. IMO Arena is really just optimal for early players who dont really care too much about ranking up and need to establish a base team with scouting. After that its better to try and rank up for Littre rewards  crystals and Dstones.The GP isnt even that good. Its  GP per  Crystals once youve sunk time into it which will be overtaken by CoD  BP max now   runs per refill once you reach GP per win. The moment you get a champion match you earn more regardless of where you are. That isnt even considering the potential rewards from the new Coliseum.

5837917,0,t1_cxkunm8,The recall system should be used when theres a significant change.Magnus had his skill buffed and was recalled. Diminishing HP reduction seems like a larger change than that. Marineco gives   stones. You might get three  and one  a week. The matches give you three guaranteed  stones every day. The additional  stones from Marineco you get are useless because the new spirit stone matches give you enough stones for your team. You dont need the additional ones from Marineco.Why are you so reluctant to let people recall their players when theres a change that greatly impacts them? Why would anyone invest into a player if theyre afraid that the player is going to be nerfed next week without a recall? The problem is with BBs philosophy of releasing imbalanced players and balancing them later. If recalls were offered more often BB would have more of an incentive to make the players balanced in the first place.,soccerspirits,cxkvm76,1,t5_33q81

If youre looking for the dps Khirel is a better option becuase of his passives but if you want to shred spirit go Malcolm.  reflex doesnt mean the ball wont get stolen it still depends on your malcolms reflex is and how much reflex the enemy player. Its not impossible taking the ball even with  reflex buff my Jury has  reflex increase and has  spu it still gets stolen because someone can still out reflex your malcolm.  Also if you want to avoid it getting stolen from you try adjusting where you place your Khirel Malcolm.  The ball will be stolen either way because both have low base reflex the totems and aces will surely help and its not everyday you run into someone with a .k reflex luka that will steal the ball. Imo since you asked a question Khirel is a better option.  He can one hit which is needed in a backline while Malcolm needs investment and needs time to stack his cruelty to fully increase his damage.  You dont have to follow what I said im just giving you the option by explaining who is better but if you doubt me and want Malcolm then go ahead. Tl dr malcolm and khirel both have low reflex  use buffs and totems to increase your reflex. With Khirel you can do more damage with him and have high reflex,soccerspirits,cxo1725,0,t5_33q81

6012677,0,t3_3xu75a,I dont think William is healthy for the game. He is pretty much maxed in all offensive stats and with the OHKO direction Bball is taking how are they going to make the new legendary strikers interesting? You can make a super Ravian that does  hp to the team but why would you want that if you can just one shot any GK in the game? Strikers should accel in one thing and have a weakness in other but thats not the case for him. With him being so strong in his current state the new legendary strikers will have to either be more broken or they will be weaker than William. Bball fucked up big time overbuffing him and there is no reason to run any other striker over William atm.  The recent buffs to the GKs doesnt really do anything to address this because William still one shots them whereas it made it harder for the rest of the strikers.

I dont really know what to do to further improve my team. So ehh any help is appreciated.

For support Id probably run either Silk or Saramir backline and eventually work to replace them with someone like Kiki and make Nerua support that alternates with Magnusifwhen you scout him.

Kiki should probably stay but if you have Ignition Catalyst then Tyler will be strong with Metatron. Whatever you choose Magnus will only make your backline better whoever you replace. You dont need Kiki and Tyler but it really depends on who you want to keep and who you think will get the job done. Tyler is good for the first steal and can penetrate to front reliably. Kiki is good through out but Magnus provides more defense that youll need against top strikers like Leventor and William.,soccerspirits,cz1pkkk,2,t5_33q81

6364598,0,t3_42tbrh,I dont agree on the nerf as that honestly doesnt diversify or make the game better it just removes what you may think the current problem is without curing it and something else will eventually take over in Sillas spot. The overarching meta is a result of the devs not knowing how they want the game to actually play and that has to be where we start from. That and at the pace the devs release stuff it will take a long time for anything to change there needs to be a much larger patch to fix anything.The only time nerfs should be warranted are if something is uncounterable and currently the only thing that you cant do much about is if the opponent uses Beth active and then they have another action bar healer on their team that goes off as well and thats really only prominent in matches where you dont get OHKOd.Silla doesnt need to be nerfed. What we lack are good ACEs in the game. If you want to diversify thats what you have to do. Add Rainbow ACEs that can even counter it and gives you other benefits. ACE that grants everyone  Penetration or all attackers on your team  Penetrations.You want people to pick certain cards that have really good Aces that force them to change their team formations.I honestly feel like this MetaBeth problem isnt one I dont know why everyone feels like it is but its VERY easy to beat MetaBeth combo at the moment by one to two shotting GKs. It will be a bigger problem sooner or later with damage reduction totems like Duran in the game.The other issue is there are just certain players that screw us over aka Attacker AI. They need to make sure attackers and not only them but all players on your team arent so dumb as to shoot the ball at a GK IF they cannot kill them AND they will not shoot if the next person that goes if they pass is either your passer with active or your striker. A lot of small details that need to be ironed out because currently we use the players we do because we want to avoid AI stupidity as much as possible.,soccerspirits,czd31xv,5,t5_33q81

First can you GK survive the shots from Kirin? Isillia is better than Nute for PvE especially against ultility strikers like Kirin.  About your backline among Lynia Hildegard and Bell who are your strongest atm? You should only keep  in the backline to Penetrate out. For me its Bell I equipped lifesteal stone on her so she can be fine on her own. The other  slots in backline should be healers  passive and  active for me they are Sammy and Avnore but you can use anyone that help keeping your line healthy.  Middle is a lost cause for me as I dont have many invested units so I put Veronica and Nerua there just for their teamwide buffs. And you may need someone like Iggy for her active skill if your strikers damage isnt enough.  Frontline is just your normally max damage setup.  As for strategy Bell will be at bottom left and continously penetrate out you should use her active soon as it will help keeping Isillia as she is much weaker if her health is loweven more if you have Silla ace. The two healers keep your GK alive use active heal if your core units like Bell or your GK is low.  When Bell reaches the frontline have her ram on Kiki. You should kill Kiki first with Bells penetration and Blades shoot your Blade should be at top left too. When she is down then you can probably kill Jin.  It may took a lot of tries but it feel really satisfying when you did it.  Good luck! ,soccerspirits,czqzxoe,1,t5_33q81

6497078,0,t1_czrb65g,you have a decent GK so ill keep raklet as many endgame players use her.yes you do need a decent striker and then a good passer.. do penguins and level up all your  stars some stars are decent too like valkia and morgana.. i would level up and do the daily EXP amp gold matches when you can especially the belowlev only rivalboss matches.. Dont try to decide what your team will be you get a legendary at lev and most of the time that decides what your team will be.. right now with crystals just draw  you need an abundancy  of stars to strengthen your team.. the quickest way to get decent striker or any card at all is to draw. needless to say a star strikerany player at all is better than a  star and stars even better.. level up order is normally striker  GK  passer  penetrator etc.of course  stars take priority. save all your resources for now except penguins to level up you will know what player to use resources on later as a general rule theres only one player you definitely wont change and will use until late game  your level  legend.. next time when you place questions please double space them it puts people off when you have a big chunk of unspaced questions. double space them thus formatting them with lines between.hope ive helped gt,soccerspirits,czrcgyb,2,t5_33q81

I was always excited to see if I could get a new card with great ecchi art. Im not good at this game but I didnt care. Still dont. Im also not able to play this game in public just because of how quickly it drained my battery and the few times I was playing in public  It didnt bother me if someone was looking at my EE Lilith card or others.Im not mad really. Just disappointed. I understand why theyd do it. Whether it was for ads rating the law money or whatever their reason was. So im not going to trash this company or the game because of a few changes. I dont see any reason for it. Though ill trash ComUs just cause I dont like any of their other games. Though I still hold BigBall in high regards.I was even about to do some research on what would be a good first purchase cause I thought this was the only mobile game that I have that deserved the money. Its not pay to win it doesnt shove ads in your face and even the things that do pop up can be closed til the next day. It really didnt force anything on me.Im going to keep trying to play for a little longer but I dont know how much longer that will be for.Sorry for formatting grammar spelling or even sounding like an idiot.

6783746,0,t1_d0l562s,gt Luka SS has  action speed for me and on lf she has . Silla gets  lf and  mid which is why I set them up that way. Maybe this changed or am I misunderstanding what the reason for the switch was? Before I was risking Hiro shooting without an active pass due to his superbs giving him high action speed this solves the problem about half the time.Actually Im being forgetful today. Luka is considered SS when shes in the middle when compared to Silla which has an ST bonus. Thats a mistake on my end. Luka would be faster SS and Silla would be faster LF. However the other consideration is if you dont OHKO where would Silla be best served. You dont want her too fast that she would act before the enemy backline so you may have to test out whether having her LF or ST is better.gt Unfortunately I dont have Kevin. Is Jeunese an adequate replacement for this type of line? Ive faced milky back lines and there is no doubt they are nasty. It would certainly be worth a try. On the other hand with the AB debuffs quick start and music start not stacking might make this type of thing rather moot. On another note I have ancient stormer on milky right now should I place that on miho instead? Ah just read on and see you covered future meta so ignore that.Kevin makes it easier for your backline to kill the enemy frontline and also provides DR for your GK. Jeunese is more of a frontliner as he doesnt provide any defensive benefits to be in the back.gt Also unfortunately my only uniques are essence of greed on anael and stormer on milky currently. Once I hit rank  ill get another one and then I plan to start cmbining. Gonna go light first as I want ermaltation for kei thousand watcher for meta and MW and the other one would be decent for hiro and a number of my other players.Save your gold to start working on stones. Its the most expensive and painstaking process but also the most beneficial to making your team stronger. You will get tons of uniques in the future both stuff you want and dont want so start investing gold now. The power of certain players arent apparent until they are setup correctly.

You wouldnt have to change anything in your team and you would be fine assuming your team is full mspu  etc... already. Dont spend to win spend to get the cards you want and ease the grind. You dont have to have the best units to get to Galaxy you just have to have a decent team that is fully invested in. If Vann can get to galaxy almost anyone can get to galaxy.

Why this is important is that no one will steal if Shu  Miho  Magnus get lower HP. you will have to rely on Isillia getting shot to get ball control at low HP. Also as someone who uses Shu on the back try the suggested one given above. If Isillia needs more survivability you may need to run man back. Good luck!,soccerspirits,d2pn5gn,1,t5_33q81

Receiving pass really shines when you have Lukaan ardor passer LOL with IC in front because that almost always guarantees youre going to get the active pass over to Leventor.  ampnbspWhat I was suggesting is the optimal case. But if you cannot guarantee a pass on Leventor then the receiving pass would be situational and youre better off going with the crit stone.

I would greatly prefer if CoD was basically a  floor trek that was less RNG reliant. Every  floors is a super boss like Superb Boss match style floor    etc. Every x floor is a gatekeeper floor floor    etc. Every x floor is a random champion floor floor    etc.I dont like the random nature of current CoD much and having more structure would be personally better for me.,soccerspirits,d2z3eur,7,t5_33q81

7614779,0,t1_d37q6ri,Socket a bluepen stone in use Guinevere for the totem thundertits is still very good and keep in mind that Sharr has an increase damage taken skill on shot which helps a little. Alternatively you could also stack a ton of crit damage since loaded crit damage can be pretty explosive but currently it only works with strikers who can reach crit rates high enough to not get cockblocked by Lucian cancer backs every shot. Just go with Luka and Guin socket blue pen if you still want more pen equip TB and focus on stats that can increase the raw amount of power Sharr has on a shoot. Though I think its better to insert a crit rate stone in the prism slot so you can crit on a defender and start stacking TB stacks.

She has no value outside of her gimmick and her gimmick does not work.  Did they revamp her?  No they just threw on a self buff which does nothing because the gimmick that the self buff enables doesnt work to begin with.

Im not against limited edition skins or the such Im against how the set the way to get it.And as you said there are many other ways to set this kind of events. Blizzard is a good example and you may know quite well how they handle their limited events. Time advertisement and overall pricingreward balance is pretty good on those. Its a good example to follow. Along with the major MOBA games and their struggles when they first put limited edition items most of them first lasting a couple days then reverting it to near a month of prior notice.And on a side note if you want me to give an example of game to goes easy on FP and still have a top grossing SLeague EUUS. It just celebrated its th birthday and in the past  months had  events from which you could get one of the best sets of the game for free just by playing it. Along with giving high price packages for the PW players.The now publisher of that game has a pretty bad reputation and a way to get the most money out of people but the producer setted little variants to close the gap between PW and FP making it a race of improvement and not a flat no money onehit killed.,soccerspirits,d3pi08k,3,t5_33q81

Why even mention Latios getting  penetration from her active by itself?  By that point its gone beyond William tier broken and shot into evenBBwouldntscrewupthisbad territory.  Two stacks is more than enough to make her way too powerful for a utility striker.  Theres a reason all three stacking active shoots are set to  attack and  something else at EE and that something else is never pen. pen and  crit damage is still outright better than Vonchis and BB has no reason to make Latios better than Vonchi.,soccerspirits,d4anxcg,1,t5_33q81

Isillia is the Hard counter to this frontline as well and shes pretty popular  even more so now that people are slotting Chitose in their backs.Lastly like I mentioned before IC nerf will make this combo unreliable as Serestia herself is slow AF and Ravian will outrun the IC starting bar in a majority of matches  who cares if Serestia users her active AFTER Ravian has shot.Edit healing is the last element that makes this a difficult combo to run consistently  everyone runs some and its easy to outlast the diminishing returns of Ravians Gravity Down  basically unless Serestavian wins within the first volley or repeated shots theyre screwed.,soccerspirits,d5kbstg,2,t5_33q81

8476183,0,t3_4vqeng,Two balance changes Id really like to see implemented.. By far my most desired change Id really like to see the base reflexes nerfed on every character across the board. Reflexes are a very useful flexible stat and currently a lot of defenders leaders and passers have base reflexes nearing  with full superbs. This means a simple  reflex buff can increase your counter attack chances by ! There are almost no other sorts of buffs that pack that much bang for your buck. As a result we get midlines stuffed with victorias metatrons and other powerful reflex buffersdebuffers. If everyones base reflexes were cut in half this would mean only a  increase to counterattack chance from a  buff meaning that other options would open up. Reflexes would remain a powerful stat but not so overpowering that your screwed if you choose to focus on lines that buff something else. It also means that there will be more flexibility to add attackers who are almost completely unused in todays current meta.. I would really like to see a change in defender AI particularly in the backline. Everybody knows the scourge of suicidal defenders suiciding themselves against enemy strikers. For the most part Im okay with that they have a high chance of counterattacking so there is some risk rewards in that situation. What I hate though is when one of your defenders successfully counter attacks and then goes to mid and suicides there. Your backline defenders are meant to protect your GK they are not designed to penetrate from back to front. When they suicide mid and bring the ball back up front with your backline one defender down they are not doing that. My mid is set up to deal with the enemy mids my backline is not. Having my defenders steal the ball and then suicide against a  man mid or heal the entire enemy team by hitting the enemy Metatron is incredibly frustrating. Id really like to see backline defender AI changed to immediately pass upon breaking out the backline. If you want to have a character break through to front from the backline there are plenty of attackers to choose from.What do you guys think?,soccerspirits,d612c97,2,t5_33q81

Between dale back and malcolm back Id take collapse camp though.Jheet is strong on attack but like all attackers arent very good at stealingtanking hits in this aspect hes probably worse than dale.You can run both Dale and Jheet together theyre both very solid midliners imo.

8555840,0,t1_d6b0yuo,I understand your argument. Reason I dont quit but asking for people to do this together is because I dont want to game to die. It is a fun game and I still believe there are a portion even small of players who although FP deserve high ranking.I dont think the only way to play and win this game is pouring money in. People invest in the game in their own way. For those who have money and no time they can go whale and use the money to buy time. I dont have any problem with this group of people. Its their choice. For those who dont have or dont want to spend money can invest their time. Im talking about this nd group. And the way the league is running now pushes this group further away from the game.I agree that at the end of the day everything revolves around money. As a developer myself I understand the hard work they have to put in to release a feature. But it doesnt mean you dont try to improve the game and fix obvious bugs that negatively affect the players because the players are those who pay their salary. Bugs like sometimes winning and getting negative points affects the nd group and not the st group too much because they can always replenish the battle balls and continue to kinda fix the bug for the game.To your point the match matching is based on ranking I dont think so. There are times Ive fought against low TA players with proper team and not troll team. Although these incidents are rare they are definitely there. To my surprise some of the weak team even made to final. Most of the times I won the final were when I won over easy team. This leads me to think that the match matching is rather more random than based upon some solid grounds. The reason I faced so many much higher TA teams is because well there are too many of them who spent a lot of money to get to the top. Statistically when you randomly pick a ball in a basket if there are too many diamond balls the chance to pick a diamond ball is really high.The reason I call for actions in the community and not complain to the companies because BB as we know lack of communication and ComUs is their propaganda. Remember how the th star patch and dev note becomes patch notes in a worse way. Even they acknowledge it it will take time for them to respond if they want to.I appreciate your insights and I think they have valid grounds thou.,soccerspirits,d6b1zpr,-1,t5_33q81

Beat it on my thth? tryJin was the only maxed unit I had. Second was Linmay with  superbs and everyone else had . No Unique either except for the Vonchi.Frontlines only purpose was to debuff enemy backline. Due to how their backline works Shura had them on permanent  CR very useful because my Vonchi had an  chance to crit otherwise. Kevin only needed to be level  for the  defense and Jury to reduce their HP. None of them ever got a turn lolMidline had CM Meiran for the  spirit upon being attacked. Princesss Sanctuary sounds good for this match but I hardly had it activated because everyone in my backline except Jin died at least  times. Lias there for her Ace I didnt have enough mats to evolve Lucian and Cynthia for the AS debuff. In hindsight maybe Silla Ace wouldve worked better but idk.Backline was all about keeping Jin alive with heals from Lucian and LinmayCR from Silk while Vonchi would penetrate down the middle until he could kill the GK with enough shoots. You have to time your penetrations right so that your nonGK backliners are aliveGK has enough HP to survive shots from both sides. Linmay is invaluable here as she healed  of the backlines HP every time she got attacked and she could get attacked up to  times.

8739058,0,t3_4zovyn,As far as this match is concerned it was easier than I thought. For your frontline Elaine and Milky Way work very well together the formers active allowing your striker to put a dent in the GKs health while the latters speed and reflex boosting skill allows the line to act before Alices ABcontrolling shenanigans can begin. For your striker a good utility striker or striker with a high crit rate should dispatch the goal keeper with a number of shots For those wondering I used Bora and it only took one try. Generally speaking if you use a utility striker with a high reflex player to steal the ball back youre golden.As far as the back is concerned I really cant say much. Having a good spirit battery like Virgil or Shu will be a big help since Soul Grave will demand more spirit. Players like Sammy and Beth will also be of good use for the AB skills they give. Also do not underestimate a long or forward pass. If you have any way to act faster do it.,soccerspirits,d6y1674,1,t5_33q81

So is Lucian a while back.Even post nerf Silla and Luka are both top tier assist just people use less assist these days and they did have recall.Miho is the only unit I can think of that is nerfed a bit and does not have recall.Metatron is buffed lol even everyone is using her.Kiki has been staplecancer for a long long time.So can you provide some examples ofgtwhich is what they are secretly always doing latelypeople overworry about possible nerf. Is Angela good sure. Does she need a nerf? I say no I think some other GK should get a slight buff. You dont just nerf the best unit in the game repetitively. We get no where and this just means PVE becomes harder and hard. It is not good for anyone.But I believe even if she is nerfed she will still be a top tier GK.And considering we have no balance change for last  patches. I dont see she been nerfed any time soon. Probably not until a major patch which is at least  months away.There is no point not using what is best in current metagame because you worry about a future nerf.,soccerspirits,d7531xk,2,t5_33q81

9068211,0,t1_d81sbpw,Sky is an interesting player having the ability to be very tanky in DR and reflex being able to fire off active passes every  mins and having some great stone slots too allowing her to equip uniques like Preys Sentence Silent Cold and Bond of Silence.With that being said while she is not a bad player there are certainly better assists out there that can fill the role in better such as Silla Luka and Renee. I would recommend Renee especially since she has a skill that boosts the crit rate and receiving pass effect of Ardor players in the line and will be receiving an EE in the next patch though Silla or Luka also work well with William.As for your totem I would recommend against Yuri. AP is good but there are better totems out there. Elaine is your best bet since she literally gives everything William needs as a totem but you could also use Milky Way since her active gives AP and crit rate. If those two do not appeal to you then you could use any totem that boosts crit rate to take advantage of Williams crit damage Such as players that have Inspiring II like Gaphyl.,soccerspirits,d81uouf,1,t5_33q81

I always used him with TB so I can attest thats also a solid choice.   How about instead of CI just put TW on her? Useful reflex  the attack buff makes it painful attacking into her.

9207177,0,t1_d8j2q8d,First there is hardly anything that is complete trash I really hate this term. Some players are weaker than others. But I dont view many players as TRASH. Show some loverespect please.. Jin only works with a Silk ace team or mono WW WWardor and WWthunder team is quite rare. I guess Rainbow team too. So if you dont run such team. you have to throw him away. Comparing to a legendary like metatronbell can fit into many teams.. OHKO is possible but much harder to pull off. Sharr can pretty much HKO everyone. So OHKO striker is not dead. OHKO meta might be.. There is no such thing as best player for best role. It depends on the team and position. And what you need. This question is way to general and hence why Red didnt answer.. I dont know waht you are talking about this game requires you to play around  minutes every  hours. Most of game is done in auto. So you can watch streamanimeread a bookwork at same time. Even you focus on game solely. That is  minutes every  hours. Which is like . hour a day max.. You can get  GP a day if you use all your battle ball in Arena chain up the wins. Do COD to highest level you can then reset everyday. And spend stamina on boss minion matches some give more GP than others like Thunder. This is not counting COTs reward. BTW COT is reworked recently. getting  clear is pretty easy. Much easier than before to say the least.No offence it sounds like you dont play the game very efficiently.There is really no reason to level up. You dont need to grind for that. Cost system is gone. And you want to keep your rank low so you get easier match up in Arena.Sharr is best  striker even match legendary striker to some extent.Jin is an amazing GK.Baltheon is the best passer in the game. Super good in PVE useful in PVP.I dont know why you think they are bad.Regardless even they are many people play this game without any legendary and still do well. So I really dont see a problem.Like Levorm said if you want to play then play. If you dont then dont. ,soccerspirits,d8j2twd,1,t5_33q81

9246189,0,t3_570r6g,It would seem so. My theory is that shes a phantom of sorts like a fairy tale character out of her book. Now according to her lore Shura instinctually follows something despite having only very vague memories. This tells us  things.  she has a strong sense of attachment to whatever shes bound to and  she has experienced loss andor something similar for her to lose her memories clarity.Now her lore also states that she fails jumps constantly jump in this context meaning something like a warp. This gives us the idea that her chosen destination is either very far away or does not exist in this dimension. Seeing as  of her skills are references to uncertainty and by extension the theory of Schrodingers Cat I believe its safe to assume that shes from a place that both exists and does not exist at the same time such as a parallel world.Im gonna go off on a tangent here but I think that Shura is just what she seems to be a character out of her own story. She belongs to a world that will never be real just like your waifu but at the same time will never cease to exist as it will live on in the minds and literature of wherever her story is from. In her EE her bandages unravel showing us that she is indeed missing parts of herself as well as fantastical elements such as a huge ass shoe. These two are what convinced me of my theorys validity. As Shura seemingly fades away by a force similar to a rubber band we see her fade into rose petals and nothingness further exploring the fact that she did not originate from that plane in the first place. Perhaps the petals possess another significance. Maybe she was brought to the physical realm by a great power like I dont know Serestia? You know the super mage who periodically seals herself off while sacrificing her memories which are an IMMENSE source of power in fiction btw.Or it could just be me,soccerspirits,d8o0syj,9,t5_33q81

For both since they can reach upwards of  Dec DMG I recommend a glab build hattip utinyemi Cant comment on askeIn a mono team  assuming pure leventor out classes vann in every aspect. If you arent pure then it depends. Vann wont work in a pure mono. Lev works in a pure mono. If youre using Elaine then use vann. If just luka vero then Lev is your best bet. I know  most of reddit says Lev is the worst striker in the game. Truth is he is one of the few left that is capable of a one shot without the use of Elaine probably the only striker capable of a one shot wittout Elaine. If someone tells you Lev is decent ask them how to improve. If someone tells you Lev is the best striker you should ask them why. If someone tells you Lev is not good dont even bother asking them anything...jkjk. But in all honesty Lev is in a very good spot right now.

Plus with the heal from dark crit dmg you wont even be able to get him to low health. Hell do k dmg with each crit and heal back up.  I think your view on this is colored by the fact you have a thunder keeper. Vonchi is very much over the top and needs to be nerfed in some way p And I agree it should be consistent so there is a weakness in having to get stacks to do dmg since otherwise the strikers that dont have stacking buffs will be left behind.  ,soccerspirits,d8vp64d,3,t5_33q81

9736107,0,t1_dad3qbr,This is what I always try to remind people when they fear nerfs and immediately start looking for a replacement. BB has a pretty good track record on nerfs. Buffs on the other hand... not so great. Too many overbuffs or EEs that gain too much. And also on the other side of the spectrum are the buffs that do virtually nothing. I dont know how BB is so good at nerfing but so bad at buffing.As for Lucian I think his main problem is what all active block GKs are having theyre active block GKs. And to think it used to be a GK was considered worse off if they didnt have an active block. But this halfbar spirit for starting with the ball sucks for them. I think BB needs to reduce all active blocks to half a bar so people arent so likely to be screwed should they start with the ball and have it immediately stolen. Otherwise hed be fine. He was op but nerfed the same time Angela got her op EE. And his nerf was nothing huge.As for Thunder and Dark Robin is actually pretty solid now. BB buffed him nicely. I dont get how Raklet got so little by comparison in the same patch. BB must seriously overestimate the value of hp. Might explain why they think decreasing max hp is fine where its at too increasing it at least revives koed players. But hopefully Dark finally gets its due with the upcoming Dark legend. They still would really like some love for their GKs.Oh and a note on chain system rework. Maybe I remember it wrong but I think BB only mentioned they are looking to finally rework chains not that this patch will have those reworks.

To help your frontline you can run Global totems in the back. Cynthia Elise Aslan Lina William frndship chain help. You can even swap out the GK for one of these totems. Match starts with you passing to William. Get a shot in. Dont steal from Erica or Nerua. If you manage to catch Yuri with the ball you can KO her with a steal if shes low enough. Youre hoping to get a shot on Angela with her under  hp and stealing doesnt help that. Erica or Nerua will attack into your line and lose the ball. The line has  CAR but its reliable enough.

10101551,0,t3_5khg0i,Looking at the last player discussion and being somewhat allured by her ace I decided to invest in Erica. I have her at mspu lvl  and Ive tried pushing her into my mono ardor squad in several positions.So CM Erica didnt work out. Ran her with TWxRed ReflexRed HP on a line with Victoria and Choi. It might just be a flaw in not having a second reflex totem other than Victoria but Erica only clocks at about k reflexes which is not impressive given shes slow and usually has to go up against Metatron.  DR isnt much either nor does she have a decent dribble or steal stat.Shes alright in the frontline since shes fairly tanky for that line especially against WW units. Shes still slow though and still not good in comparison to your typical frontliner. The problem is that shes just a wall and does not provide any boost of damage aside from a decent pass stat. Her defender AI causes her to steal from high HP players that may have received a pass from the GK which is bad coz unless she reflex steals shes doomed to die and reflex stealing in the frontline is not Ardors strong suit.Backline Erica will probably end up being the line where shell be the least of a liability to. She could tank shots or be a stealer.So far Ive found that shes been underwhelming and I think its because shes just straight up missing something. The most obvious thing she needs is a second stat to her global totem especially if you compare her to Nera Latios Verister and Veronica. Its odd that on going from I to II the skill just gets a  boost in HP to the team. If shes not missing a second totem here she either poorly stated or could use an additional passive buff on her nd passive. I get that she does not gel well with Ardors roster of broken players and not everyone will compare favorably to them but the way she currently is I feel shes incomplete considering she was moved from GK to defender without much of a change.,soccerspirits,dbo8u0p,2,t5_33q81

10112797,0,t1_dbpoe14,I remember talking about blade the other day with someone. Was it you ? Either way. I havent touched blade since Oct When I got Lev. recently though I had a look at her and she is in a really bad place even with Ace burst. She has the numbers but build up is so slow It doesnt help that all of thunders players are Squishy as fuck.Overall regarding Aces I think Guin is still the best as you can reach   Pen on shooting with any Pen stones or Glab. I Also moved TB off her for ShoT and found it worked better.Stones A variation of double red CD and Double blue Rec pass. Either work depending on how often you crit and Ifwhere Silk is on the opposing team.Having such high pen means ditching Luka for karpilla The line would then be VeronicaIggyKarpBlade. I think Iggy With EC is too slow to make a substantial and constant difference. Iggy with CI Does show promise but she lacks good DR then and gets blown up to easily. Ill try her again if I get Ancient Stormer. I have tried  man front and mid I think  man mid is better when Meta and Vivid isnt in the picture otherwise  man front is MUCH better. You main problem is getting the ball back which usually your mid does for you but if you can get a steal off on kevins and Virgils youer golden Big IF since Those are match winningLosing Steals.Only other ace That showed promise was Raklets  and Hildes but thats not saying much.

Otherwise if you get some crit res on her hello Silk shell be sturdy. Give her a Preys Sentence or the standard silent cold in front. At CM I figure Stars Tears might be a great idea.

Karpilla needs to act or this is useless  stats ap and crit rate for  minutes compare Evy skill . She buffs  stats in an always on fashion for the line.  Its impossible to argue who got the better skill here.  Skill  is where Karpilla can potentially shine.  more pass. AS and reflex means she can produce an INSANE pass if her team gets stalled out and finally get the ball to her. If she has IC? You probably arent stopping her. Compare Evy effort and shes hampered by the ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT NERF TO SELFISH AB GAIN THAT EVYLIN LIA AND NARI DONT DESERVE.  chains. Evylin is better chain wise. But thunder cant bitch here. Normally thunder gets all the godlike chains. Both have easy access to affection chain which is super important.  art theyre both cute as fuck. Dont argue. Evy looks pretty with ee.

So look for players with totems that increases reflex attack power and critto further boost your attack power.  From your list I can see Bell Meiran and Lynia being the most ideal candidates for midline. Silk saramir serestia could work too but silk is better off in the back while saramir lacks attack power and serestia doesnt do much if she doesnt get to move.

Any suggestions on which stone to pick? Im leaning towards maybe EBM TW or DM.  If I pick EBM I can use it on Elaine and move SC to Milky.  If TW I can use it on Sammy and then replace Erica with P. Meiran for more reflex in my mid which admittedly I do have trouble breaking through sometimes.  I can use DM on Angela and maybe use PoME on Sammy instead to make her a more tank CM.Any thoughts on which of the three I should go for?

10609105,0,t3_5ruemx,Its been a fun ride but Ive officially quit Soccer Spirits.  Sold my account and everything.  There were multiple reasons but they are all issues with the game rather than some IRL reason.First BBs refusal to properly balance stars.  One of the main reasons I stuck around for so long was to one day see players like Lynbell or Niarose become competitive with units like Victoria or Gaphyl introducing more variety in PvP.  After seeing the Anael and Leahs buffs I can already see the hopeless future that awaits.Second I had already beaten everything. There was no challenge left for me to overcome so in terms of being an actual game I was just plain done.  The only thing left was to play around with waifus but my favorites are all shit now besides Metatron see point one and that got real old.Lastly the x. crystal thing.  They might as well have just let everyone keep the legends because the advantage gained from the bug whether intentionally or unintentionally was way too huge.  Its not just crystals but GP and free STs from mileage if you were smart.  I dont actually care about the resources themselves since I dont need any of it see point two but its another indicator of BBs complete lack of sense not just in game balance and coding but also in administration.,soccerspirits,dda8xr8,4,t5_33q81

Comparing just  numbers sadly not enough to make your Irre vs BT comparison not a joke.   vs  IRRE IS MUCH BETTER is an OK approach for a kid but modeling and evaluation are far more complex there are a lot of things to consider and count.  Next time I suggest you to put more time in a real comparison than in design of your post.  Is  CR better than  CR when  Cr Leventor smashing you with active?Is active block once in  min enough to save from active pass  active shoot combo with crit or consecutive active passshoot in block and active passshoot combo?  It is only few situations and there are lots of them with different important factors do a research considering every single one and youll get a real result.I have put a lot of time in modeling Irres perfomance and feel confident in the results I got.    And you are still complaining bb didnt buff irre enough?????  once again rework is not considered as a buff.  Even BB stated change of concept in comments of patch note.  IMO she was lacking one more passive but active and rd passive had to stay maybe with a small buff of proc probability but this changes gives community mediocre GK instead of unique and interesting one.  ,soccerspirits,ddxs8jl,1,t5_33q81

11171654,0,t1_dey5yie,Hes my take on your team take it for what it is  my advice You have a solid foundation but will have to either go full rainbow and find Silla or stick to  colors for example ArdorLight with Gaphyl Ace or something.Early into the game it doesnt matter too much who youre using where. However youll have to adjust your backline according to your GK. Isillia being Light she doesnt benefit from Neruas totem and as such Nerua is a waste. Nikita is a good filler as she can ball hold extremely well. Ultimately youll want to use Gaphyl and Virgil for Healing shenanigans and because Virgil is a very good unit.Gaphyl is a monster and you should   MSPU him asap. Hell simply carry your backline and probably your entire team as well as he heals everyone through lifting his smallest fingers.Milky Way is tricky to use. Shes extremely fast and provides important stats but shes mostly there for her active. Which benefits strikers. Place her on your front for the time being to replace Nera. Shell give Crit and AP to Kyoko to help her crit more reliably and thus deal more damage. Shell remain squishy until you give her a Calm IcicleLight Reflex spirit on CALight Crit Health on crit and another stone of your choice. In my front she actually reliably steals the ball back either through brute force or by outreflexing opponent backliners. Invest on her if you believe that shell be helpful in the long run. Shes mostly paired with utility strikers but could potentially work with Kyoko. You could also replace her with Elaine who does the same job and would be on color with your ardor units Malcolm is a good PVE unit because he can leash health and spirit. But in PvP hes just a dead weight. He wont hold back his ground and doesnt provide any totems. Hence hell just get rekt by opponents. Ultimately and I know youre using him for his ace youll want to replace him with Victoria who is a hidden Legend and will benefit your mid A LOT.Last case is Beth... I could go on for hours telling you that she needs buffs because its true. But she is not weak either. Shes beefy hits like a truck and can replenish some AB to your team. She works great on a side but can be your filler CM for the time being I use her there too. Her biggest issue is that shell get reflex stolen most of the time.And Ill stop there for the time being Choose which way you want to go for your team I recommend ArdorLight but once again youre free to do as you see fit and look out for key players such as Elaine Victoria Chitose andor Black Ivy ,soccerspirits,deyamkg,1,t5_33q81

Shes strong but sometimes I just dont understand her. The reasoning behind Guin CM is that if you run a Fontus on her she would have the damage and the CAR to be a wall. You can doubledown on her by using her Ace as well. An alternative thats also proven to work is Lukia CM with a Fontus. Hell Jury CM is freaking scary too.

Like he is slower than Crystal Maiden or Itsukis AE in Initial D.   While he is very offensive oriented he wont have much chance to act which render his buff hard to stack. Unlike Meiran in WW Ardor are not super speedy so Jacob is really hard to use in PvP.   But in PvE he is one of the best unit for OHKO strat imo.

11737688,0,t1_dgqdtud,Actually WoM william isnt what it used to be if u watch closely most of the high league william recently just swap back  to TB or other unique the reason is simple keepers are to tanky r now so utility with out a stacking effect are doom William in short... srly why have pssion if everyone run him as a KO Striker and well pretsy literally kill any sense of utility with the damn paralyze so r now is either one shot the keeper in ur first moves or start stacking passive until u manage to get enough damage even i used to play WoM William and he wasnt perfoming to good so i change his WoM for SoB and the matches became ten times easier,soccerspirits,dgqhw94,1,t5_33q81
