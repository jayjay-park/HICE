9718137,0,t3_5e66e3,Im feeling good today! I weighed in at .lbs down today which is  pounds down total for the challenge. The struggle is a bit of TMI. My loose skin is becoming a big annoyance in my upper body my lower body seems to be decently elastic. The largest amount of my loose skin is around my under arms and on my boobs for reference Ive lost one pants size and four bra sizes while Ive been losing weight...Anyway the TMI part my loose skin around my chest pulls and moves around so much that Ive gotten a blisterrash ? under one of my breasts right around where the band of my underwire sports bra goes and its so painful especially when Im running! Does anyone have experience with this and have suggestions on what to do about it or is the solution just to suck it up and wait for it to go away?,TeamBlackHole,daayz4a,4,t5_3gvfm

9831420,0,t1_dao80l1,Have you tried to create a goalgame for yourself and your sweet tooth? I know I have a weakness for breakfast snackssweets so I had to come up with something that would reward me later for a successful denial of treat now. Worked well for me. Perhaps you can tweak it to suit your needs?gt Quarter Cupgt  Place a cup or container in your car  desk or where ever you are most likely to buckle under snack pressure.gt  Every time you choose not to swing by Krispy Kreme for that morning donut or reach for your waytoomanycalories snack you put  quarter in the cup.gt  Every lb you loose you put  quarters in the cup.gt At the end of the challenge I had more than enough cash to go see a movie and reward myself with popcorn! So I actively pushed for my own snacking reward but I actually had to earn it. Maybe you dont use quarters but fill the cup with some denomination of coin and when you reach say  opportunities that you didnt eat the yummy reeses cup you then get you actually reward yourself with  small yummies?,TeamBlackHole,dap20ev,2,t5_3gvfm
9843979,0,t3_5g5f6g,My success this week is a little cruel in a way. Hubby is an emotional eater and boy has he an appetite.  He has a big exam coming up so exercise and portion control have gone out of the window recently. This week he wanted takeaway  different nights.My success is that Ive thwarted him both times so havent been drawn into overeating alongside him. First time we had veggies which needed eating so stuck to the meal plan. The second time I brought fish n chips home as he asked but the fresh salmon steak kind not the deep fried kind!Thankfully his exam is only a couple of days away then hell be back on the wagon again ,TeamBlackHole,daqoz7j,3,t5_3gvfm
