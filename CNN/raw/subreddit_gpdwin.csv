Ive also always done the peck typing method where you just type with your index fingers and forego the homerow entirely which seems to work just fine on the GPD Win.

10225153,0,t3_5mer16,I dont know what version of the game you tried but the PAL version and the PAL versions of most GC and Wii games run a decent bit better than NTSC and NTSCJ games because they only demand fps to run full speed instead of fps.

For if you should get a GPD Win right now entirely depends what you are planning to do with it the new revision doesnt have any big flaws or build quality issues in general obviously some will their quality control is shit so I recommend getting it from a close reseller if you get a bad unit its easier to exchange it. and makes quite a neat little emulation machine and generally good machine for indie games and older titles. Watch youtube videos and lurk the subreddit to help you make up your mind.

A lot of bluetooth devices have a different profile for working as a handsfree speaker which has a much worse quality than normal playback mode. Then also click on the device under Sound and go to Enhancements tab and check Disable all enhancements also under Advanced tab make sure the Default Format is at least KHzCD Quality.
