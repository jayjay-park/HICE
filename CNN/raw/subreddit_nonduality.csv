1968253,0,t1_ckpa9vs,Alas that explanation is just a story and one that doesnt stand up to critical scrutiny.We have this idea that a brain is composed of brain cells working together to form a complex network of information processing that allows the arising of a conscious observer of the universe. Now consider for a moment that for an observer to see something separate from itself there must be an endpoint. Photons hit an eye the eye relays the sensory information to the optic nerve by way of electrical current the current is received by multiple brain cells that fire off a chain reaction and process the information. We claim that the brain is the endpoint the thing that sees. That is it isnt the eye that we say is aware we treat the eye like a camera hooked up to the actual viewer of all we see and we say the brain is that viewer. Now we will come to one of the problems.You perceive multiple things at once a single brain cell receiving an electrical impulse would see one little bit of information not a complete picture of the world around you as you see. This means that you are aware of multiple brain cells states at once right? That would mean if you were a brain that your awareness would simultaneously include several brain cells at once like a field of awareness encompassing your entire brain. Of course if there is an areaofeffect awareness that means youre not the physical brain but the field of awareness that pervades it. The physicalist scientific theory of mind is a comfortable idea. Its enough of an explanation for us to say ok we got it but with enough hand waving and I dont know to cover up the fact that it doesnt work. It can explain behavior but not what philosophers refer to as qualia. A brain might describe how to build an automaton that can move around the universe and even think but never with any knowledge of what it does. Nobody would see it and for all intents and purposes it may as well not exist. ,nonduality,ckqdj5a,1,t5_2sf91
1969905,0,t1_ckqiyln,I dont think you understand. The physicalist explanation is logically impossible. Nonduality is actually the logical conclusion and the only way to rectify the problem of infinite regress encountered when trying to find the observer in the physicalist approach not making up answers willynilly as you say.Im trying to explain to you that the physicalist approach is not supported by the evidence unless you suspend disbelief to an incredible level. Granted Im only speaking about nonduality not necessarily any more detailed explanations...  I cannot tell you what we are but I do know what we are not... and what we are not is a brain.,nonduality,ckqkoop,1,t5_2sf91
3149434,0,t1_cono4q9,Its unfortunate that the Upanishads have resulted in folks taking epistemological stands based on an interpretation of their content apart from an experiential reckoning of its truths. Were this not the case folks might begin to understand the truth that multipartite existence retains its appearance of reality even from within the experiential understanding of nonduality that the Upanishads refer to as jnana.,nonduality,coofoyn,1,t5_2sf91
