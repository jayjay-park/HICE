But also other planets could be outside this zone but still strongly support life due to things like volcanic activity denser atmosphere trapping more heat lighter atmosphere alloing more heat to escape more water less water etc. Venus could support life it had a spinning magnetic core and water. That would block out most of the rays and the water acts a heat buffer allowing life to grow.         Here a great calculator sponsered by NASA,theydidthemonstermath,dgrh8nh,1,t5_31iwz
