4734998,0,t3_3f9yij,The errors you are seeing are likely due to permissions. I would verify if the user in your log source has permission to read the directory you specified in the Protocol configuration.ampnbspAlternately you can use WinCollect to collect and forward these events in. Im not sure how many sites are managed by the IIS server but if there are a lot  sites then I would recommend WinCollect with the IIS plugin to collect these events. The reason being is that WinCollect sits on the IIS server locally. Since IIS updates logs every  seconds we have to read down through all of the remote directories with the protocol which takes time. WinCollect is installed locally with admin permissions rarely has local collection issues and has high performance for monitoring logs from IIS servers. ampnbspI typically recommend WinCollect for IIS events. However my first guess as mentioned is that you have a permission issue reading that directory remotely. If you contact support we can enable debug for that protocol and find the root cause. Not sure what IIS version you are running but I would open a ticket for verification if you want to use the IIS protocol. The debug should give the precise reason of the issue.ampnbspHope this helps..hard to troubleshoot with the detail provided as it could be a config issue or potentially a performance issue trying to poll a lot of remote sites. However we can help if you want to open a ticket on the issue. ,QRadar,ctre0rd,1,t5_35j7a
7010233,0,t1_d19ulys,Ah so your existing agents were not likely in Standalone mode. The installation command that you had listed in your post is only used for standalone WinCollect agents agents that are not centrally managed and do not use port . The Standalone Patch installer is special as it is used to update agents that are not managed by a QRadar appliance. It cannot update normal WinCollect agents they must be disconnected.ampnbspFor most administrators  To upgrade form .. latest  gt WinCollect .. the only action administrators only need to take is to install the .. SFS file on the Console. Any agents who have Automatic Updates Enabled set to True will be updated without  minutes of the SFS being installed on the Console.  This information is outlined here WinCollect .. Release Notes  ampnbsp  NOTE Installing the SFS will restart services and force a deploy during the installation.  ampnbsp  Glad that you were able to sort out the issue. ,QRadar,d1ayfr4,1,t5_35j7a
7028146,0,t1_d1c3ssg,You can also manipulate reference sets using the QRadar REST interface you can get a feel by going to the URL  console addressgtapidoc .The endpoint you want to look at is under referencedata  referencedatasets from there you can create  populate  delete reference set programatically so depending on where you get the URLS from you may be able write something to automate populating a reference set.Once you have them in a reference set you can use them in most places in QRadar namely saved searches and custom rules. Custom rules is most likely what you want from a custom rule you can set an offense to be raised if a URL is matched or run your own script via custom actions to do what ever you want.,QRadar,d1czs5g,2,t5_35j7a
