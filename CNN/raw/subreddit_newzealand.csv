Also I cant exactly speak for the compsys faculty since I never studied there. I actually did first year at the University of Canterbury and transferred following the earthquakes. I would say that in my experience the quality of teaching at Canterbury was higher at the time.Finding a job for me was easy. I found a job starting in  with  months left to study. Employers were really desperate for civil graduates. The companies often present at the university both through career fairs and also separately with meet amp greets with food and drinks in lecture theatres in the evenings. It made it easy to network and eventually find a job. Unfortunately I cant speak for any of the international students.

So while Ive never suggested this guy abused anybody I hold him accountable for the things he has publicly stated and the ripple effect of hurt and abuse that could cause.I do think its likely that where theres smoke theres fire and if hes so passionate about this he must have dabbled.

305221,0,t1_cfcdwjp,gtYou keep insisting that because I think she has no empathy I must therefore think shes a sociopath. The problem there is that I dont think that. I think shes got no empathy. Full stop. That is the total sum of my thoughts about her mentality.Well you have a categorization problem here. Its not a question of me telling you what you should think. If you insist this person cannot empathise then you have categorised her as a sociopath regardless of your lack of understanding of the symptoms of the condition.It would be like you saying you had a small furry feline pet and I said you had a cat then you insisting you never said you had a cat.A person who cannot experience empathy is categorised as a sociopath they are they same thing. Its not the case that you classed her as someone with a diminished empathic response where they could possibly be classified with a narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder. gtYou are also implicitly claiming that you know what construes a sociopath.Yes the classification is exactly that of a person who cannot experience an empathic response.gtDo you? Are you qualified to make such a diagnosis? Is it possible that being diagnosed sociopath requires attributes other than lack of empathy? Is it possible there are other types of mental illness or conditions which involve lack of empathy?Im not the one making the diagnosis here you claimed she cannot empathise. I said that such a person is called a sociopath.gtUnless you are a mental health professional with relevant experience I am quite certain that you are not qualified to decide who is or is not a sociopath. This also means that you are doubly disqualified from telling me that I think shes a sociopath.What are your qualifications for diagnosing this women as someone who cannot experience an empathic response or for that matter what qualified professional at CYFs decided that she is beyond rehabilitation?,newzealand,cfcej7r,1,t5_2qhma

German banks for instance are rarely permitted to lend more than  percent of the value of a property thus a wouldbe home buyer first needs to accumulate a deposit of at least  percent. To cap it all ownership of a home is subject to a serious consumption tax while landlords are encouraged by favorable tax treatment to maximize the availability of rental properties.Its interesting to see the differing views. Renting is encouraged vs ownership the kiwi dream.We still hold onto that for some reason. I rent and Im quite happy to for years to come. No maintenance costs flexibility to move wherever I want going to be great for school zoning. Its not the end of the world at all IMHO.

Some parts I understand needing to get a specific type of evidence. They cant pay you unless they know what your costs are. But attending an appointment and being told to go home and book another appointment? That should never happen.If the case manager at the time didnt know what was going on it was their job to find out not to say cant help you.With that final update... Did it for her? Rubbish. Its standard process to just update Disability Allowance costs without backdating and making a debt because Disability Allowance costs are so irregular making debts on them is unreasonable unless the client was purposefully misleading.Advice if you have a disability and its at all possible. Appoint an agent someone you trust to deal with Work and Income for you. Responsible for attending appointments that youre not up to attending someone that can make decisions for you. Taking a support person with you even to an appointment someone that can remind you that you havent covered the things you wanted to bring up.

One of the main stats that economists use to track house affordability is simply the amount it costs to buy versus rent a home and in New Zealand the amount people are willing to spend to buy a home is WAY higher than what that same home rents for especially compared to other countries.   Its crazy! The only way it makes sense to buy a home is if you assume prices will keep rocketing up.  Maybe they will but as that reporter points out no improvements have been made and now its worth twice what it used to be? Sounds like a bubble to me. Sure youll still have a peice of land instead of a piece of paper at the end of the day but youll look down and realise that you own a cliff side with a poorly insulated damp cold home that youll be begging renters to stay in for half of what you pay in mortgage... ,newzealand,cg9zt87,4,t5_2qhma

647827,0,t1_cgdsmxt,Hes not necessarily saying a cinema release it could be a download and even one with DRM e.g. that Ultraviolet DRM that Hollywood is so fond of.With the ability to download the must provide an option to kiwis requirement is satisfied and cinemas can continue to follow the school holidays schedule as much as they want. That its available via download probably doesnt mean much to parents thinking about school holidays  parents usually just want to get the children out of the house to any event. The marketing hype can still ramp up around school holidays and the cinemas can screen it then. And no copyright is at risk providing its available online and nonkids movies arent restricted unnecessarily.The school holidays argument was most recently heard at last years parliamentary hearings on the  month ban on DVD imports which I attended and spoke at. Cinema groups and Quickflix said the same thing... that they need an exclusive monopoly against DVDs of kids movies in this case Smurfs  to fit around school holiday schedules. That  month DVD ban was reduced to  months last year and the MPs said that they would probably scrap it next time the issue is up for review because its a stupid ban.Dotcom is right to say that theres a relationship between legal options and piracy. We should always be looking at ways of encouraging legal options. A lot of piracy in New Zealand is a supply problem. Under the Berne convention every country gets to decide how damages read fines for infringement are calculated. So perhaps Dotcom has in mind a law change that scaled damages on the retail cost of an item ... not available  very low damages retail copy available  normal damages. Perhaps that would be what Dotcom has in mind. That way copyright protection stays the same but the damages are reduced if theres not a legal copy available.,newzealand,cgdwpdu,6,t5_2qhma

778068,0,t1_cgsk2g5,Given that every single minor party in our political system has been formed by MPs defecting and starting their own party even the Greens used to be part of the Alliance conventional wisdom is that lowering the thresholds too much would encourage party fragmentation. There are several negative effects this might haveWith no threshold individual MPs would need less than  of the vote to be elected and it is likely we would see a larger number of independent MPs or defacto independents like Peter Dunne. If nothing else this would make government formation much more difficult given that every government under MMP has either been coalition or a minority government with support on confidence and supply. Rather than just three or four parties having to agree to form a government we might have to have half a dozen or more. these negotiations would probably take a long time and might necessitate re holding elections multiple times until a majority emerges. Once youve formed a government its likely to be less stable and might have trouble passing legislation as minor parties  independents might hold the country to ransom by threatening to bring down the government. If there are fears that the tail wags the dog now though they are largely unfounded such fears would be magnified and may compromise the legitimacy of the government in the publics eye.We tried this in the th Century before the Liberal party formed. The constantly shifting webs of independent MPs making up the government made for serious difficulties passing legislation. This also led to a lot of pork barrel type projects  MPs who looked after their own constituency to the detriment of the rest of the country. National and Labour cant afford to ignore the majority whereas a Christchurch Racists Party could conceivably get elected if the thresholds were non existent and pursue just their voters cause. Massive numbers of independent MPs also meant that it was very hard be an informed voter because it was so difficult to keep clear who supported what as each MP might have a different opinion on every single debate. This apparent instability isnt good for our economy or our democracy.TLDR having no threshold would fail to meet the Royal Commissions th th th and potentially th criteria.,newzealand,cgspy88,2,t5_2qhma

993982,0,t1_chh8mrj,Thanks for replying  this is really interesting for me. I agree with some of your points appreciate others while respectfully disagreeing and cant understand a couple of them at all.Labour sucks  This is your main point and its hard to argue with. Labour did not handle being voted out of power well at all. They simultaneously lost their leader and best political asset lost a huge proportion of their sitting MPs and came up against something they havent had to deal with for a very very long time a National party led by a likable popular leader. As a result they basically spun in circles for the next term and a half being too distracted with scapegoating and rolling whoever was leader at the time to really focus on looking like they could form a credible government. For me personally Cunliffe has more or less stopped the rot and Labour is rebuilding. I say this as a party supporter and I accept it could take more time possibly a lot more time to win over everyone who lost patience with them. Cunliffe is no Helen Clark and hes no John Key  but he doesnt have to be John Key to lead the country. Weve had some pretty unlikable PMs over the years Muldoon Bolger Shipley and I reckon Id take Cunliffe over them.I dont really accept that Labour squandered their terms and I think its a bit unfair to heap all the credit for NZs strong economic performance during that time on the decade rather than Labours management. Im guessing you would probably credit at least some of NZs decent economic performance during the GFC to Nationals policies and not entirely to external factors such as the fact that our major trading partners Australia and China were largely unaffected by the GFC. Its more honest to acknowledge that any government has a modest but limited influence on overall economic performance rather than cheering for your teams wins and dismissing the other teams ones.Negative politics and anemic policies is unfortunately just all you have to work with when youre in opposition. You can announce policies til the cows come home and nobody cares until theyre ready to vote out the government. You can use negative politics which I call keeping the government honest to try and change peoples minds or you can sit on your ass and wait. But youll probably be waiting for a really long time.Greens  Id like to know more about how you think theyve lost their way. I think their policies are awesome! but I would. What crap in particular are you referring to? Is it the printing money thing? I also dont understand what you mean by the Ministry of regulating house prices and cant see any reference to anything like it in their housing policy.I also disagree that a coalition of the left is necessarily such a bad thing. Labour worked with the Greens in all three of their last terms and it was a stable constructive relationship during which the Greens consistently built their support up to the point that they are the only real selfsustaining third party in Parliament. By contrast every support partner National has had has distintegrated and every one of them bar the Maori party is looking doubtful to even reenter Parliament this year. I also dont think that criticism has been fairly applied. Nobody has been criticising National for implementing Acts ludicrous charter school policy and nobody even blinked an eye when John Key was talking up the Conservatives as a potential support partner! Talk about your bizarre concessions  can you imagine what Colin Craig might demand?And for the last damn time Russel Norman wouldnt be the Finance Minister. As far as I know hes never shown an interest in the job and Labour have categorically ruled out it ever happening. This is National party spin.Less governance  Thats cool  we have different political views  disagreement over the the merits of cutting taxincreasing tax will always exist. Thats a fair reason to choose who youre voting for.More comfortable with National in tough times  I find this really interesting because I completely agree. In fact its the whole reason Ive made all these enormous posts instead of doing my work this morning. Im really curious as to why this impression exists and how much of it is due to historyhard figures and how much is due to gut feelings.I think National has done a pretty good job with their overall management of the economy in their two terms. I disagree with specific aspects of it of course but overall theyve done the right thing. Again my central point is that they have taken a classical Keynesian approach and borrowed a whole lot of money to insulate the economy and keep it ticking over during the GFC. This is almost certainly exactly what Labour would have done. By contrast the National party of  would have slashed welfare instead of borrowing money.What makes me angry is John Key claiming like its a proven fact that Labour would have done a worse job of managing the economy and in particular borrowed irresponsibly. This is based on nothing and contrary to all recent history. Just look at the ad that this thread is all about  any naive voter would look at it and conclude that Labour borrowed a whole lot of money in their last term and National has been paying it back. Thats exactly wrong.Apologies for the length of this  feel free to not read it. Just chewing some stuff over.,newzealand,chh9u3j,5,t5_2qhma

1046218,0,t1_chn1x3c,The small number of immigrants may seem like a drop in the ocean but there are a high portion of home purchasers among the immigrant population Morgan is discussing and they move to Auckland and Christchurch because that is where the jobs are. As I have noted there is a disproportionate impact as well because these immigrants often have quite good cash reserves when they arrive. All of this suggests there should be a direct increase in demand. How big this increase is is up in the air but the impact of immigration on house prices is well researched internationally and is generally thought to be significant. So Gareth Morgans graph is evidence of a sort. It is not sufficient on its own but it aligns with other evidence and a plausible model. For these reasons I was questioning your ability to dismiss the data in a glib manner. ,newzealand,chn7kac,1,t5_2qhma

I dont even know if I think of myself as a statist maybe I am but I think that weve got a system currently in place that is imperfect and I think personally that if wielded correctly by society could benefit said society.

1403211,0,t3_2a6xnu,I have an interesting story. I am an American who moved to Australia and have just moved to New Zealand. I routinely get asked Why did you leave the US! I moved to Australia in  at the height of the GFC. i had a Job I was doing OK but I was unhappy with my life in the States. I felt all I did was work and go home and I did not have enough money or time to enjoy life. I had wanted to move overseas for a bit so I did to Australia and in the process met my now Husband who is a Kiwi. While in Australia since at the time I couldnt bring my partner back to the US with me for SameSex relationships were not valid in terms of Immigration at the time. We stayed in Australia I found it expensive in just about all areas but I liked the people and I found that the pace of life was better than it was in the US. The pay was agreeable as well. The problem for me was Australian racism. I found myself on the receiving end of racism a few times at work and in personal lives and I felt that was a bit too much for me. Also with Australias commitment to not recognising our Marriage coupled with my Husbands desire to be closer to home. We recently moved to Auckland. Here the pace is MUCH slower. Even slower than Australia. I have found New Zealand so far to be a bit more diverse than Australia and a bit more friendlier. My accent doesnt get the scorn as easily as it did in Australia so that makes me happy. When it comes to prices it is a mixed bag. Some things are still more expensive Petrol some food prices but I have found things here are also cheaper meat electronics which I enjoy. The biggest thing for me is the worklife balance. I feel like I am not racing anymore but more like strolling. I dont have to work  hours a week or even  or  hours a week. I feel that I can take a break and not be thought of as insane or worry that if I take my time getting to full employment it is not going to destroy my career. I am working as a contractor atm to me that is worth more than a high paying Job or the fastest internet though I like NZs internet compared to Ozs I now work to Live not live to work... and that makes me happy. ,newzealand,cis6879,17,t5_2qhma

1720936,0,t1_cjvbxf9,FYI the Greens auditors just repeated my concerns about secondary effects and expect the figures to be overstated. Tariffs cant be done. Weve signed up to too many FTAs. Having a lowwage economy is no solution. Getting more science and engineering graduates will definitely help but mostly to accelerate automation.ICT automation is happening now. Its getting GPs laidoff lawyers laidoff office staff laid off accountants laid off etc. The rise of generalist as opposed to expensive custom robotic automation is just starting. This will see truck drivers and taxi drivers out of a job factory workers out of a job supermarket workers out of a job. Automation works by spreading revenue at a company over fewer employees thereby increasing GDP per capita at the level of the economy once the employees get new jobs.The prices of wholesale electricity are rising as the market structure is broadly an oligopoly with localized monopolies. This is why prices are rising  there is an online trading platform for retailers to buy wholesale electricity. Due to the power of the wholesalers prices are inflating. The short of my thinking is that in the mediumterm electricity demand is actually going to fall slightly even with moderate uptake of electric cars. There is a chance the electricity might become semidemocratized in the mediumterm solar power which would slash the value of those assets by slashing demand by say . Its a risk that can be managed but it is still a risk. Given that the NZX needed some good listings and we needed the money apparently Im glad that this risk is partially absorbed by rich folks. As to cartel behaviour this has been effectively happening for years in the online wholesale market. NZ is simply too small and has too few energy sources.Yeah Im not enthused about the dolphins. I mean people accuse National of caving to big business. This is clearly a case of the Greens caving to environmental activists. NZ wants them to be more pragmatic than that which is why NationalGreens coalition is the dream team.I agree that the government should be driving electric vehicle uptake.

Theres an implicit assumption that the interests of the  residents in those rural areas outweigh the interests of the thousands more people who could get the benefit of housing if those areas were developed more and that the interests of the landowners who dont want development in those areas outweigh the interests of those landowners who would prefer to subdivide their land for financial gain.

As more information gets leaked about supposedly representational Governments all over the world this seems more and more true. Governments often seem to pass things contradictory to what the general public appears to want without referendums. Party promises hopefully come through but a lot of shady stuff seems to happen in the background. Laws seem to get passed that few citizens seem to want. I am not just talking about NZ of course but the general feeling is one of crossing your fingers and hoping. That is not the kind of difference that makes me want to get out there and vote. I do take an interest in NZ politics but I fear only a more direct democracy would actually cause me to feel like I could make any kind of difference. Voting is the best we have right now perhaps.

1867630,0,t1_cke84bc,Havent ironed out all the details. And as the saying goes the devil is in the details. You would have to make allowances for children also.Current benefit rates are closer to week. For adults this would cost about  billion and for kids at half the rate of adults would cost about  billion. For a total of  billion for the entire populace. Current social spending that this would replace is currently over  billion I go into funding further down.There are many advantages to replacing your benefit system with a UBI. Im just going to focus on the economic advantages. Currently our unemployment benefit provides motivation to not work. Also many who truly need help are incapable of navigating the bureaucractic hurdles and  as you need to go through the debacle that is WINZ if you participate in the workforce at all and risk losing your benefit entirely.Much of the money spent in this is injected straight back into the economy in the form of spending and provides opportunities for entrepreneurs and businesses to provide more goods and services to the lower segment of the population as most lower and middle class families spend every dime that they earn just getting by. As the money velocity increases government recoups the spending faster in its taxes.If you look at the money velocity in the US It has hit an all time record low which is a symptom of economic stagnation due to concentration of wealth the US govt is battling it by quantitative easing but not addressing the fundamental money flow issues in their economies. Partly its due to acceleration in automation due to computers and mechanical processes replacing both blue and white collar workers alike.So the issues are that the lower classes no longer have much disposable income despite being more educated than any generation before them. Less spending money in the economy means less work for most people. Money spent maintaining debt just concentrates wealth further increasing the rate of money flow to the financial services sector which just keep expanding their pile of investments in further financial services. The wealthy dont spend the same as the lower classes Contrary to many supplyside economists we do not have a productivity crises we have a demand crises due to lack of potential goods and services customers. Spending opens opportunity for entrepreneurialism and jobs. Much of investment appears to merely increase the cost of living for the working classes. This investment includes land speculation commodity speculation rentseeking financial services.Other benefits include the ability of a worker to take a hiatus to attempt a start up without immediately devastating their savings. More opportunity to stop work and invest in personal education. Also could be implemented with a decrease in minimum wage actually increasing the competitiveness of our local industries on the international scene.Workers could choose to work fewer hours perhaps to look after their children more or follow creative desires opening up opportunities for others currently unemployed. to participate in the workforce. They could also afford to take more risks going after roles that they would be more suited to performing.Another advantage would be in decentralising the economy in smaller communities. People would be able to survive outside of Auckland where the property prices are far less and the spending stimulus in these communities would create jobs where they are currently dying out.Current tax take would be boosted by the stimulus that a UBI would create alone but you would need to implement comprehensive unloopholed capital gains taxes especially on land and increase the progressive nature of income tax. Including some high brackets to prevent the high end investors from snow balling and all of the issues that accompany concentration of wealth.Im sure theres way more effects that it would have this is just what I could think of off the top of my head.Subscribe to rbasic income or futurology for more info.Cheers.,newzealand,cke8ri7,15,t5_2qhma

1895104,0,t1_ckhhexl,gt Id say tax over  on any income bracket amounts to thieverySo  isnt thievery and  is? Thats a very odd way of looking at things.All tax is thievery if you want to call it that but its far better to have a government that takes money from people than it is to have no government. An economy that allows for high incomes requires good governance so the choice is between having a high income and paying high tax or having a much lower income and paying less tax.A lowtax market economy leads to massive wealth inequality and a huge increase in the number of poor people which isnt sustainable because after a while there arent enough people left to sell things to.gt taking huge chunks of income from people who bothered to earn it so you can give it to people whose life aspiration is to be mediocreIf you think that individual hard work is the main determinant of income then you arent living in the same country as the rest of us.,newzealand,ckhjtpw,4,t5_2qhma

Or person who follows you out of an elevator to ask you on a date... And the point you say no and they continue is the moment it becomes unwanted sexual attention.  Sometimes before that.  Sometimes its a partner.  it is still sexual assault as defined aboveEvery girl I know has a story or more than one one of my bad habits is to encourage these sorts of discussions because you can see the odd one who has never had anything like that happen to her she is like you totally disbelieves. And she is usually the only one in a group.  Although I freely admit that the guy leaning on your car and stopping you from driving away is a shadow of the guy who threatens to kill you if you dont do what he wants... but both guys are a problem to girls. In your case you are objecting to the definition.  But the definition is accurate.  And as for the NZNSCV  You realise this question fits sexual abuse?  Did you notice it is only victims of crimes reported.  therefore expected to be underreported. Did you notice people will under report for the exact reasons you noted? ie that he was the boyfriend and arent you always supposed to give him what he wants right?Since all of these surveys identify underreporting as an issue with their question type I seriously doubt they are useless for your argument.,newzealand,cl77kpn,1,t5_2qhma

2117126,0,t3_2j6txc,Medical Perspective Current strains of cannabis doing the rounds are high in THC and low in cannabidiol which is a bad combination as the latter helps mitigate the effects of the former. The cannabinoids are also the beneficial part sought in medicinal cannabis. As a result we still have a lot of cannabis induced psychoses presenting to the hospitals and people being effected sometimes permanently. Also smoking cannabis is hella bad for your lungs.However if legalizing meant our authorities could quite tightly control which strains of pot were available to the public and reverse the THCcannabidiol ratios to like they were in the past then I totally agree that legalisation would be the way to go.But... if we were to simply lift the ban on the way it currently is the fear is that more people will try pot and those most vulnerable to the negative effects will suffer most from the current dodgy strains. This will undoubtedly stretch our healthcare even more. You could argue that taxing pot would help alleviate that problem but this would just encourage people to grow their own and pass it round for cheap taxfree. If there was a way to prevent this it would be great.Of course the places that have legalized it seem to be doing well but not enough data is out on how its affecting their healthcare systems. Basically legalisation would be great for most but very bad for some unless extra protections are put in place.Edit Source on THC vs Cannabidiol and one on the antipsychotic effects of cannabidiol,newzealand,cl8xl9y,2,t5_2qhma

2157909,0,t1_cle3h8v,Alright I am going to have a crack at this firstly note I am not a doctor but I work in the medical field and have also personally dealt with my own mental illness.   You are right in one regard looking at yourself and learning to detect what may set your mental illness off and how your external stimuli can effect you is a fantastic step and one that has been shown to improve the ability for an individual to overcome a mental illness. This can and has worked for individuals to get better without the aid of mental health professionals or medication.However the majority of people who suffer from serious mental illness at least need the help of professionals and most likely medication. Dont see medication as this evil thing that doctors are trying to force on you. Mental illness is caused by the misregulation of genetic elements or chemical interactions within the brain. Much like an individual whose legs muscles are not quite working right will limp an individual with neurons and regulatory chemicals that are not working properly will not feel right. Much like physio and mental skills training can help the person with a limp medication and mental skills training can help a person with a mental illness. Medication can restore the correct function of the neural system and help mitigate and damage caused by a hereditary gene mutation if that is the cause. Until gene therapy becomes the big thing addressing the cause in these situations is impossible.I dont know you but I hope you reconsider and go back and talk to your doctor and form a plan to continue your recovery. This might mean medication but I assure you the doctor and mental health staff are prepared to work WITH you to see you better.,newzealand,cle4bc7,5,t5_2qhma

I expect other people to avoid using racist or homophobic epithets out of respect for these disadvantaged groups that have been and continue to be persecuted. If my friends or acquaintances used that kind of language I expect them to do better if they wish to retain me as a friend. If someone at my workplace used those words they should expect a swift written warning from HR or to be dismissed for repeated infractions.If some people are alienated by that state of affairs maybe they should be alienated.  Now tell me isnt the above evidence that we can and already do expect other people to adjust their behaviour to meet a certain standard?  You might dispute whether rape jokes should be part of that standard but what youve said above doesnt say that  it instead argues that we dont and shouldnt expect any standard at all and seems not to agree with the fact that a we clearly do expect standards from peopleb these standards are higher now than they were  years agoc these standards are being successfully enforced in at least some casesIn light of this obvious line of reasoning your not my problem response doesnt look like a conclusion you reached about the futility of social standards in discourse but instead looks more like an admission that you dont care.

2254754,0,t1_clpuvfy,gt Im not sure offering customers such an unattractive service is the solution.The solution seems pretty attractive given the number of people who use it. Look at it this way. Perhaps Vodafone decides to half the price of their standard  plan  for mb. Now they also sell GB for .This doesnt really add much cost to their network so all seems fine. But then people start to move. A decent share lets say  of the mb plan people dont need that much and would like to save money. So they change to the  plan.But theyd get more customers? Surely? No because once you do something like this other providers would do the same to avoid loosing market share.Now theyve just lost  of their revenue that goes towards paying CAPEX costs while not gaining significant market share. This is called a noncollusive oligopoly. It occurs because of the high cost of entry in mobile data millions if not billions rolling out a national network. Perhaps overtime people would use more and go back to paying the same but now the network provider has no change in revenue but slightly higher costsnetwork congestion. ,newzealand,clqer97,1,t5_2qhma

2369854,0,t3_2mia62,. Grant. David. Andrew. NanaiaAs a campaigner Grant is the best of the lot. He has fantastic media skills a very warm personality and is certainly the most likeable of the lot. Looking at the campaign he has run for leadership it blows the others out of the water. His website and social media were extremely professional and he had an army of volunteers that none of the others had. He has an aspirational style of speaking and campaigning that makes me believe he is the best fit to organise a campaign and inspire not only our core but middle nz as well.I put David number  because I consider him the safe choice. He is the most qualified and probably the smartest of the lot and i dont see any way he can posibly be worse than Cunliffe. He could hold the ship together. He may be nerdy but he is polite and old people like that. He is also a very good debator. If he lets PR people mould his image he could do well a la Don Brash.I am not a huge fan of Andrew. He is probably going to win the election with his support from the unions but I dont see his ability to reach across the aisle and pull centrist voters. Centrists like aspirational leaders not antagonistic and negative ones. His voice is raspy and he naturally looks angry. He was by far the worst performer at the hustings and gave me no confidence in his ability to win over a crowd of voters. I credit his abilites as an organiser but not as a personality figure.I despise the fact that Nanaia entered the race.

2483823,0,t3_2o0vpd,Why should we? The IS poses no threat to us and our military poses little threat to them particularly alongside the much larger American British and Australian forces. Whilst the end goal may be to Defeat ISIS there is no clear idea as to what comes next Do we give the territory back to Assad? Do we install a bunch of secular rebels that we know virtually nothing about in the former IS?It would also be worth pointing out that the IS real power lies in its ability to inspire. Just like we saw in Canada it only takes one determined enough home grown nut job to launch an attack in New Zealand something one might be tempted to do were we to join in the war. Foreign states getting carried away by a thirst for heroism and glory is exactly what created the mess in Iraq in the first place as well as in Afghanistan Kosovo Libya ect. Until it becomes clear what New Zealand will gain and risk from entering into this conflict and what the clear strategic goals are including plans as to what should happen were the IS defeated it would be extremely imprudent to enter into such a conflict.,newzealand,cmirvan,10,t5_2qhma

If the outcome is the eradication of IS power then we need an overwhelming military intervention. No halfassed measures that will have everyone sitting there for years getting nowhere.But more importantly what happens after that? As pointed out below we dont want to replace IS with another band of cavemen who will be the next IS in  years time.So far I see no sign that our great leaders have had those discussions which means another forever war with no clear objectives or withdrawal plan. As long as that continues New Zealand should limit itself to providing humanitarian assistance. We cant do nothing but we also shouldnt validate an illconsidered unstrategy.,newzealand,cmj6d0p,2,t5_2qhma

If you cant agree to that much I honestly dont know what she could do to communicate her objection to your satisfaction short of becoming physically violent. Whether or not all bum slaps are inappropriate isnt actually what is being debated here. What is being debated is what response social legal is appropriate in those cases where the activity isnt consensual and whether this ruling measures up to the standards we do or should demand from the ERA.Youve chosen to pick a bone with those people disputing the ERAs ruling.In that context just restating the conclusion of the ERA as an argument or a response to an argument is about as much begging the question as you can get. Lastly the ERAs ruling is being objected to on the grounds that it questions why she did not complain earlier when she quit the next fucking day and labels Ms. Newman unreliable when what is portrayed as the central issue ie the slap itself and whether it occurred is not among the disputed facts. The defense was that it was fun ugh? not that it didnt happen.  The only real question remaining is whether it was clearly and unambiguously consensual and its apparent that whatever contrived workplace comaraderie you might  imagine buttslapping being okay in that was definitely not present here given that she is quitting her job and laying a complaint.,newzealand,cn1xso3,7,t5_2qhma

That will take you South only as far as Papakura where from there you are reaching the outskirts of the city. Be wary as Orcs do Venture this far north and may require engagement from time to time. Stay out of crossbow range and dispatch with low MP attacks using Fire or Ice. Only then can you venture further south via the SH And itll prob be broken up by drivers getting from Papakura to Pukekohe which means dropping you off at Bombay. From Bombay you should be able to get to Pokeno or Mercer and then you will find drivers heading All the way to Hamiltron the famed City of the Future. Be wary of the many wares they have on offer as they are often charmed with ill intent. I recommend shielded cloaks while travelling through the town with protection against Shitty Weed Nursing and Political Science students and Tainui legal representatives.

A conspiracy theory is its very nature unofficial because it promotes a different narrative to the official one. I dont believe there was any Conspiring between the U.S Government or terrorists for  since there is no evidence for that being the case. My point was that the US government could not orchestrate killing  of its own citizens without information leaking out. The US was warned prior to  by Israel of a major terrorist attack but didnt believe that it was a significant threat. Before the TSA and other security measures it was possible to hijack a plane and it did happen. So no information did leak out. Foreign intelligence did pick up on  or at least the event that would become it. Again however my point was that I dont believe the US government could orchestrate such a grand conspiracy without proof leaking out NOT that terrorists could do so. No proof has emerged so far. There has been no testimony by the imaginary demolition agents so so I still dont believe that it was possible.

2929147,0,t1_co114rw,ECT is not a long term treatment. I would say for me the benefit from treatment began probably halfway through the course and lasted around six to eight weeks after the final session. Though the level of depressive symptoms which returned was lower than pretreatment but I suspect that is more likely due to natural waxing and waning.That was always the idea it was seen by myself and my team psychiatrist clinical psychologist mental health nurse as a case manager as a means to an end. I was in a bad way and based on previous episodes knew things were only going to get worse. Things were sufficiently bad that i wasnt really able to productively engage in therapy.So the idea was to give me a bloody great kick up the rear end get me to a position where I was doing sufficiently better so I could properly engage in therapy and that is what would provide the long term benefit.ECT doesnt really get rid of mental illnesses its more like painkillers.

3224650,0,t1_cow5cia,ucomputerd gtAlso... take in your cell phone open up the voice recorder and start recording. My policy is ALWAYS record any kind of official meeting whether its a secret recording or not.Ive done this ever since the CEO of Select Recruitment in Dunedin grilled me over a hot flame for an hour about my religious beliefs and life history. I wish I had recorded that because it was an extremely serious violation of the HRA.The laws around privacy and covert recording are pretty vague but seem to hinge on whether the information youre recording was solicited or not. Recording solicited information and disclosing it is a violation of the privacy act. Unsolicited? OK.Id be pretty confident that anything said by your employer in a disciplinary meeting is unsolicited and therefore transcripts of covert recordings should be admissible in employment court. But again this is an extremely grey area in law. From what I can tell it should be legal for YOU to secretly record a disciplinary meeting but not for the employer to do so.Even if you dont disclose a covert recording later it can still be useful to yourself for recalling what waswasnt said. In any case youd want to run it by your lawyer anyway. This is especially the case since disciplinary meetings can become emotional and what you and the other party said is easily forgotten because youre under a lot of stress.So Id advise to record openly if you can get away with it and record covertly if you cant. Just always run it past a lawyer before disclosing anything including the fact that you made a secret recording.,newzealand,cow8lo0,19,t5_2qhma

3428669,0,t3_2zg5mv,I know this is an emotional topic but lets think this through.The purported reason for feeding kids through these programs is that a full tummy is going to help them concentrate in class lifting their educational achievement and helping to break the cycle of poverty.  Sounds good.  But is it true?  Well research on foodinschools programs often fails to demonstrate any effect on educational achievement.  In  an Auckland study of  schools running a free breakfast program found thatgt A free SBP school breakfast program did not have a significant effect on childrens school attendance or academic achievement but had significant positive effects on childrens shortterm satiety ratings.So the only result from their research was that the kids said they were less hungry unsurprising since youve just fed them but found NO effect on school attendance or academic results.The money spent on foodinschool programmes is effectively a monetary transfer to parents as they no longer have to spend money on school breakfastslunches.  In which case you might as well simply increase the benefit andor the Working for Families tax credit rather than bother with the time and administrative costs of running a foodinschools program finding volunteers setting up kitchen facilities etc.Heres a blog post reviewing a wider range of studies relating to foodinschool programs.Perhaps more individualised solutions as Shearer talks about will do more good.,newzealand,cpj3e3x,25,t5_2qhma

Now I can install directly from any app store without region swapping and side loading and can pay with my regular CC. This has greatly simplified the whole process of getting Netflix and swapping libraries is incredibly simple.Netflix knows that there is already plenty of people who are using VPNs to access their service and at the end of the day theyre still getting paid regardless of what region youre actually watching so even if they have to hang around and buy rights over the next couple years before they have a decent local library they know the process of watching their US or UK services is simple enough that people will continue to pay them.,newzealand,cpnbwvo,2,t5_2qhma

Well that is the aim anyway.And it very very nearly worked for me but it just wasnt quite long enough theyre about mins Id need something that lasts at least an hour or two at this stage and not quite dull enough.

New section A cl  provides for a new offence of indecent communication with a person aged under  which is directed to fill a gap in current offence provisions.  Under new s A and  an accused person may only rely on defences that he or she believed that person to be of or over that age andor that he or she did not know that the material was indecent if that person proves that defence...gt.By requiring an accused person to prove a defence to a criminal charge these provisions limit the right to presumption of innocence affirmed by s c of the Bill of Rights Act.  However that limit can here be justified on the basis thatThe long and short of it is that anyone can now be accused of possessing child pornography. One must now be able to prove  not just in the civil sense of the balance of probabilities but in the beyond a reasonable doubt standard  that every single thing they have ever seen on their computer not just downloaded is legal. That is ass backwards. If the government suspects someone of possessing child pornography  a serious crime  shouldnt they be forced to prove that the material is in fact illegal?

3765084,0,t1_cqleovs,I run a small marketing business. Every week I meet new heads of smalltomedium sized industrial businesses with the intention of taking them on as clients to do marketing work for. During the early recession things out there got tight and it became increasingly difficult to make a dollar. Later the Christchurch earthquake hit and pretty much every company out there stopped spending a cent overnight. Things were tough and we were looking at the possibility of the bank taking our home.What was really interesting was the terrifying ease which negative or fearbased talk in New Zealand directly effected whether these companies spent money or slammed the doors closed tight.The one thing most of these company bosses had in common was they were fearful any Government would make unexpected changes that would effect their cashflow. Government policy aside there is currently a feeling of economic stability and comfortable predictability that loosens the pursestrings and drives the economy.I get work in this economic environment and when I do I pay other guys to help me do it so theyre working and making money too.Many middleclass New Zealanders including myself prefer the predicability of the most centerist Government choice with no crazy changes or reckless taxpayermoney spending appearing that might cause economic upset.We still have our home but it really truly was touchandgo for a while there and there is no way we want to risk being in that boat again.,newzealand,cqlg53i,-2,t5_2qhma

4013149,0,t1_crdo56t,gt If you increase minimum wages then this directly improves the wellbeing of those in shit jobs.Ideally capital substitution would eliminate the shit job.gt Basically the only ways to make shitty jobs less shitty and to have less shitty jobs are to regulate and to strengthen unions.There is a strong tendency that when jobs become less shitty they also become less productive. This isnt always true but over the decades this has been true with union members unwilling to pitch in to get a job done because it was some other union members job. I mean theyre the worst examples but theyre those that stick in peoples minds.gt Organised labour is better able to negotiate outcomes than individual workers.I agree. Labour should be able to negotiate collectively. The legal and other support that comes with unions is something I see as their largest benefit though.gt The longterm solutions are around increasing productivity. That means lots of complicated things that arent happening now.The obvious thing is a transfer of human capital from lowskill to highskill which everyone seems to avoid as its too hard. That and greater capital intensive industries.I actually like the day trial law we have here given the safeguards. I think discussions around the harm such provisions do have on families perceptually minimizes the problems faced by lowincome lowskill employees and households which amounts to how do I progress?It used to be that getting into a union job would do that for you.

4291234,0,t1_cs94p6e,gtNo economist has ever endorsed it.It may be that no economist has endorsed it but that doesnt leave out the fact that the mainstream economics boilsdown to an endorsement of trickle down.Deep down in the foundation of economics you get these fancy equations such as the Fundamental theorems of welfare economics Digging down even further things start to get political when you strip away the glossy scientific equations and look at the assumptions and end goals of mainstream economics. The end goal of the Fundamental theorems of welfare economics for examplegtPareto efficiency or Pareto optimality is a state of allocation of resources in which it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off.Consider thisPerson A lives on a island with a bunch of other people and everyone notices their life is shit in comparison to person A. With the islanders existence and the distribution of resources being the objective reality of island life i.e. it could be measured objectively such as comparing bank accounts it can be considered Pareto efficient as an economist would be forced assume that everyone started out the same. Using mainstream economic principles an economist would look at the islanders problem and be forbidden from considering How person A has gained their wealth such as inheriting all the land or any past interactions that has led to person A being in such a good position e.g.  years ago everybody put their money together to send them to university . That those two agents  person A and everybody else are anything more than two agents there is no society. Even if everyone on the entire island said fuck this shit mainstream economics would be backing person A. That person A may have better information or have had the good luck to do well in the genetic lottery e.g. Had the connections to strip Russia of its resources at the fall of he USSR then came to the island and purchased it off some selfinterested representative of the island.Any economic policy that puts forward redistribution from one person to another is automatically a bad economic policy. Redistribution cannot be justified by mainstream economics as it causes what they essentially believe to be an injustice which just so happens to align with rightwing politics. Doing nothing is the only solution mainstream economic theory would advise in the above scenario.Mainstream economics is built around equations where the optimal solution is people keeping their money regardless of history or anything other than maintaining a myopic version of justice and what should be. Economics is not some neutral science and is very closely linked to political philosophy. TLDR The mainstream economics may not overtly endorse trickle down but they are theoretically bound to promote it and will take political sides despite their purported neutrality.,newzealand,cs9cdoh,2,t5_2qhma

Then one of the people organizing who is a psychopath in my opinion decided to take it a step further add personal information and make the other person who is still standing up for themselves who dead rooster calls still lying seem like the one who is doxxingidentifying people.When in reality the one who apologised has doxxed people before and admitted it to my face. That person is a cocky psychopathic cunt who makes pedophilic comments to their friends sibling about her daughter.Who tries to turn people against another person because that person may or may not have spread rumours about them and physically threatened to hurt two people of the opposite gender and their size was mentioned in that threat.And if that freak is reading this because that cunt unfriended me on facebook youre no friend of mine.

Some phones handle all the bands and can be used with any of them.I have a Vodafone prepay  which for  per  days not per month provides MB and  minutes per month unlimited txt and free calls to vodafone NZ mobiles on weekends. What makes it the best plan for my use is that it has carryover for anything not used. As I tend to use less than MB and  minutes per month the extra I have available just keeps on increasing as long as I remember to top up before the next months bill. Missing the payment wipes out the carryover. Degrees has an identical  Carryover Combo plan. They try to market themselves as a cheaper alternative to Vodafone but Vodafone makes it difficult for  Degrees to stay cheaper i.e. it is an ongoing arms race.It looks like the Skinny  with rollover is the exact equivalent of those plans but for .

4533113,0,t3_3d5alx,Youll find that almost all food in New Zealand comes from farms. Id be wary about most that promote themselves as operating with this ethos as it is usually purely a marketing scheme and quite often the preparation is minimal and something that you could do yourself. Just aim for a quality restaurant and you will be eating food that someone had put thought into beyond just which piece of dirt it came out of.Food like youll see from Manresa doesnt exist here because there isnt the population density to justify having that number of chefs preparing food and our restaurant culture is still catching up to the idea of globalisation it is happening just slowlyCheck out the Cuisine good food guidemetro food awards for a list of restaurants.,newzealand,ct216rt,-1,t5_2qhma

This isnt the first incident. It sure as hell isnt the only incident. Every experience Ive had involving Chorus has been bleeding with incompetence. I tried to get a second phone line connected to my house and they spent  months sending out techs who either didnt know how to do it or didnt have the required materialsequipment.Reports like this happen everywhere especially if you read NZ based gaming or tech communities.You should watch how you respond to peoples posts because the level of mockery youve used applies to you rather than myself for thinking this is any sort of implication that its a single incident you should have thought a little before responding.,newzealand,ct2mrpb,-6,t5_2qhma

Its summer so you have warmer drier weather for whatever you want to do.Penguins arent weatherseason related so that works any time of year.For easy access tramping Id recommend The Abel Tasman trackIt is nominally a  day track to do the whole thing but there are many water taxis which can drop you off and pick you up anywhere along it so many people just do one day of it or a couple and then get picked up and taken back to civilization. If you are doing that you dont need to carry a heavy pack just a day pack or overnight pack.  Or they will provide you with a kayak or snorkel and you can spend a day paddling or diving in between tramping. Huts do need to be booked in advance since the track is in high demand in summer.gt Golden beaches crystal clear waters caves and lush coastal forest this gentle walk offers multiple scenic treats.Stop along the way to swim kayak or snorkel by the seals and penguins at Tonga Island Marine Reserve one of DOCs Coastal Gems.Probably best to do this outside the main public holidays e.g. after midFeb when everyone is back at school otherwise it is overrun with tourists and booked out well in advance. Main holidays schools etc are end of November to mid Feb so those tend to be the times to avoid at the more crowded tourist areas.,newzealand,ct4hh6l,4,t5_2qhma

Because our esteemed leaders want very badly for you to believe that they have the magical ability to control a monopoly on cyberweapons god I hate that word but I dont have a better one.This is highly public proof that that is absurd. If you create and maintain weaknesses so that you can use them then everyone can use them.

If you cant get the capital to incubate dont fuck the industry by being its voice then chasing your own needs. What we do and say factors into VC decisions and while Im sure theyd disregard you the climate is still a part of risk analysis and affects all of us.To respond to your original response to the comment thread OP who cares what Immigration New Zealand think about what people should be paid? They enforce an employment law. They didnt make the law and they dont care or have a mandate regarding industry salaries in New Zealand. This late justification you made is crazy and employers raging about workforce protections drives me crazy. Youre way off base. Dont be that guy.I want to see our industry take off here as much as you do but with the amount of money were trying to engage with theres no point in arguing over a few thousand dollars per employee.

I mean ok fine I accept that they have a right to their car parks and if it were during the day when they do business then absolutely it would be shitty for us to take their parking spaces. But at pm when theyre sitting inside drinking beer why do they care? Theyre just doing it to be difficult. Its seriously childish.,newzealand,ctbitbb,-4,t5_2qhma

I look for a solution which will fix the problem or at least do a better job than the current situation. The charter school is not doing that. The ministry and other agencies pointed that out but Parata overruled them.Your argument that it must be doing a better job is specious what is actually happening is that it has the protection of a meddling and incompetent minister.The argument for charter schools seems to be the state system isnt working! That ignores the reality that the problems are not constrained to the schools and it ignores the reality that this charter school is worse. The framework for improving attendancewhich is the issue hereis a little more complex than putting in a touchyfeely school. The schools need to be responsive and there needs to be support for families around therenot just from the schools but generally. The charter school is not achieving that. So. If National were not bound by privatisation ideology they would institute a regionwide approach tracking students and families so that transient kids are identified and supported and commit resources to the families so that they can keep their kids in schools. They would also support the schools in providing environments where kids want to go and learn and where families want to send their children to learn.Instead we have a singleschool in the boondocks of the Far North which hopes to capture a transient and disconnected group of youth and their families just because it is awesomeonly its not awesome.

4881764,0,t1_cu9dyao,It is or should be taken seriously.  Two examples.  Coming up five years ago  people died in a methane fuelled mine explosion.  That was entirely down to an utterly corrupted and lax safety system.   Under these proposals a lot of those workplaces for the contractors and small firms would not require a HampS person.  I have heard stories about what went on in that mine from people who should know and it is disgraceful.The other is building.  A few four? five? years ago there were a spate of deaths and serious injuries on building sites.  So there were law changes enacted and a lot of money pumped into enforcement.  If you work on a building site and a Worksafe inspector drives by and sees it noncompliant you get an instant fine and the site is shut down.  No exceptions.  HampS adds between  and k to the cost of a midspec residential build today.  That is direct cost not delay attributed to say not being able to get scaffolds up because the fucking scaffolder has let you down or whatever.  But what has happened in building is the culture has changed in my experience.  I have clients who are roofers builders and they say its just not worth it now to be non compliant.

4957719,0,t1_cuihkkv,gtOk ill bite one more comment. Yes i do wish we lived in a society where you could bash thieves if they are in the act. The main problem with vigilante justice is that without due process innocent people get lynchmobbed.But there are others. The justice system isnt designed to be for the benefit of the criminal or of the wronged party but to improve society in general ... Which is mostly about everyone else. When it becomes legal to bash someone even with due process and especially without due process and unpleasant feat of the police or your neighbours makes life worse.gt I do not at all think that assaulting someone to prevent a crime is more serious than the person instigating the crime.You think committing previous bodily harm including brain damage is a less serious crime than stealing a screwdriver?You may find youre alone in that aspect of ethics.gt I do not think you should be allowed to go around and assault anybody just because you want to. You have taken my support of assault out of context.But Id you think someone is about to commit a crime you should be able to assault them?In many circumstances thats no different from random assaults.gtI have never broken a law. Good on you. Ever punched anyone when you were a kid? Out threatened to punch them? Or acted so that they might have reasonably felt physically threatened?Or walked across a road against a red light?gtI have never sped more than an average  or km over the limit give or take accuracy of speedometer nor have i ever jaywalked by new zealands legal definition. Driving  or  km over the limit is breaking the law.gtIn this particular scenario i do not think me speculating what type of criminals they are is any less warranted than you speculating what type of criminal they are. Theres two differences that I think makes your speculation materially less warranted. Your speculation led to you making judgements about their likely recidivism which I think is against the principle if innocent until proven guilty. I didnt speculate about what kind of criminals they are.gtEither way we are both speculating we could both be wrong or we could both be right.No just you.gt What i do know is that thieves generally arent the most trusted people in society so i think its better to err on the side of caution. I dont think bashing someone into unconsciousness is cautious. Its more reckless.gt They dont handcuff you upon arrest for a crime because the cuffs are pretty they do it because you are no longer trusted to obey by the laws. They dont always handcuff you to arrest you.gtMy opinion has not got me in any trouble but someone commented that people like me should be locked up.Almost. I certainly rather have thieves on the loose than violent criminals. Including violent criminals that think theyre vigilantes.gt Which shows that at least some people hate and distrust a law abiding citizen that hates criminals more than the criminal.Law abiding people who advocate battery and grievous bodily harm deadly out on the street?gtIf you have ever been on facebook there are often posts about people hating the police because they were arrested for the fifth time or because they got a speeding ticket. I dont hate the police at all. Could it be because i give them no reason to get involved in my life? I dont know. If lack of interaction with the police is the most common reason for not hating them then theres probably improvements that could be made to police culture.gtHave you ever been affected by crime? Sure.gtHave you ever experienced the feeling of being violated and given the person that violated you a hug and a  note because punishment is clearly not the amswer in your opinion?You seem to have missed the point of the fine. The violent drunk who was fined put two people in hospital and one of them was knocked out.Thats the reason for the fine. There was a crime committed by him.gt You notice how most people who publically fight againt guns are people who have had loved ones murdered by them. No I havent noticed that.gt Or who fight against rape because they were or know someone they love was raped? No I havent noticed that either. How do you fight against rape? Wander the city at night with a shotgun?gtI just want to know why you think a criminal  thief or murderer or jaywalker should be protected from harm.Because a violent society is much worse than one with diminished property rights.,newzealand,cujgldh,1,t5_2qhma

Prisons in this country are monitored and with guards a dangerous situation should not be allowed to progress to the point where rape occurs. Not for anyone and especially not for a prisoner who has been identified as vulnerable.It is even more disgusting that a vulnerable prisoner can be taken from protective segregation and put into the mainstream prison population against their will. Having said that I disagree with the proposed system of placing people in sex segregated prisons purely based on how they tell staff they identify.But there must be a better system than the one we have. Perhaps a unit for transgender prisoners? That way they are neither in solitary protective confinement or left in the mainstream prison populations. ,newzealand,cw9khn8,1,t5_2qhma

5565155,0,t1_cwlxs6r,You entire experience of culture and your interpretation of it seems to be via anecdote. Which is only understandable we form conclusions from our experiences because we believe innately that such experiences will determine future actions.But this is simply not the case. It is not even sometimes the case. Our minds are inherently prone towards bias. We tend to compartmentalise others into similar to ourselves and dissimilar to ourselves. Those whom we see ourselves in we tend to ascribe positive bias and vice versa. As a result we tend to colour our experiences via a confirmation bias. We tend to accept the evidence that confirms our preconceived notions of who is more likely to be a certain way. Often we refuse to accept any evidence to the contrary as it causes within us a cognitive dissonance. And most damnably when people who look like us do things that we consider distasteful we consider that person a bad person. But when people who look different to us do those same things we consider that a symptom of a cultural or racial truth.Im sorry you had a poor experience with an Indian flatmate. But if you had a white flatmate who did the same thing would you reach the same conclusion? That NZ european culture instills male privilege? I do not think so. Because after all you are white I assume and so how could this be a cultural norm if you dont display these behaviours? But you do not extend this same courtesy and understanding to others. Similarly with your other stories. Have you never heard of a white man perpetrating a rape? Or punching someone in the face? I see fights among white people all the time white people commit crime all the time white people are sexist all the time along with every other group of people. Why is this not evidence of a systematic white flaw? Is it because it doesnt happen as much? Now I wont argue with statistics. But to a degree the numbers are arbitrary when it comes to the way we actually treat others and are only used retroactively to justify our beliefs. For example men are more likely to commit almost any single crime than women. By an incredible margin. A much greater margin than ethnicity can provide. And yet I doubt you would deploy a bias against all men such that you wouldnt flat with a man or such that an example of a man committing a crime would be portrayed as an example of male cultural inferiority. Indeed when the male Indian flatmate was sexist his identifying and categorising feature was his country of origin not his sex. So if you do not fear all men then why fear all Moroccans even if they do punch more people or fear all middle eastern migrants even if they do by the numbers commit more rape? Is it not fair to allow individuals to display their own individual worth? And ultimately these differences in behaviour are not inherent to these people. They arise from the environment. Of course refugees in Europe commit more crime  this is what happens when one grows up in a war torn nation lives a life of poverty and is forced out of necessity to move to an environment where one lacks a support structure and experiences animosity from others. Of course religion plays a part but in general the interpretation and practice of religious beliefs is an effect rather than a cause. This happens in all people and if New Zealand was subject to such an environment our next generation would grow up just the same because such environments are conducive to such changes. In addition can you really speak with authority about an entire culture? I feel that you have very little understanding of Indian culture. In fact I would wager zero understanding other than any knowledge you have assimilated via portrayal of Indian culture in media often from an outsider perspective or through your limited interaction with Indians. I dont say this to belittle you. But you throw the word culture around as if it can be defined with by a phrase. Culture is a nebulous variegated thing. It has been defined and described in many different ways. It is enormous. To say that Indian culture instills male privilege is unfounded and an incredibly reductive and simplistic statement. Now I am not being naive. Of course there are many Indian men who do not believe women to be on equal terms with men. I would not even argue against the notion that there are cultural barriers to full equality. But it seems quite insulting to assume that all men are subject to some sort of indoctrination of the inferiority of women would you not agree? And it seems quite myopic to not consider that as much as it might involve misogyny Indian culture also includes the womens right movements that fight to restore balance. Why are the men who fight for womens rights left stranded in your cultural assessment? Simple because they do not coincide with your preconceived notions. If you were to ever meet one I daresay you would consider them to be an exception or would reframe their behaviour. To give you something more to think about India is divided into several states each with their own language. These states were governed sovereignly before the arrival of the British and were only unified into the nation of India in . What do France and Germany have in common? About as much as two Indian states have in common. Their political unification has not eradicated centuries of cultural differences. The states of Kerala in particular has a traditionally matriarchal society and today women continue to experience a high social standing. Female literacy rates are as high as male literacy rates. So where does Kerala fit in to your beliefs? The point is that culture is complex. Saying that this culture is bad this culture is good is boorish and simple. It does not reflect the realities of individual identity and cultural diversity and ignores cultural strengths. It also allows us to divert attention from our own cultural issues. Sure there are NZ men who also treat women with respect but what about those awful Indians they do it far more than us!! All cultures have what we might describe as cultural issues but it is only for other cultures that we tend to assume that such issues are ingrained and inescapable. When criticising immigration on the basis of cultural incompatibility we tend to forget the weaknesses of our culture that could perhaps be enriched by the strengths of others.You seem very ready and willing to make wide statements based on limited experiences. I think it would be a lot more fair to people to allow them to demonstrate their own nature rather than having it pre assumed. After all you extend this courtesy to people that look like you so why not do it to people that dont? The fact that you had an Indian flatmate that was rather difficult does not mean that this will always be the case and I hope you come to realise that.,newzealand,cwmwp8s,1,t5_2qhma

5573515,0,t1_cwnx0q4,It basically works like this. Strip away any HTML by deleting anything that is before the first  and after the last . Replace the   characters with lt and gt. Load the resulting cleaned up XML into an XML object. This indexes it so you can just use a loop to automatically read every single value in the XML then use ifthen statements to select exactly what data Im interested in malware name threat score etc. Each value I am looking for is loaded into a list of lists. For example a single entry in the list would look something like this    typemalware pathCwindowssystemvirus.dll threatrating computernameGARYPC    So that is a list of information an individual item of malware that is detected. It is an example of a single entry in a list of thousands of sublists.. Using this list I can quickly insert this data into a database the structure of which Ive already defined elsewhere. This would look something like INSERT INTO malware VALUES ???? then I also give it the list and it automatically replaces the each question mark with a value from the each list in the big list of lists and inserts it into the database.. Once its in the database I can use SQL statements to find that data Im interested in. For example I could write SELECT  FROM malware WHERE computername  GARYPC and it will show me ONLY malware that was detected on that PC. Or I could go SELECT DISTINCT computername FROM malware WHERE threatscore gt  to find all PCs that have malware with a threat score higher than .Now I want to extend the functionality so theres a simple user interface that does all the ugly SELECT shit behind the scenes and the user just clicks buttons to make stuff happen. This would be reasonably easy to do and thats what my proposal would be about.gtIve often fantasized about building a screen reader standalonecpu keyboardmouse device that would basically hook up to the VGA output port most everyone is using laptops as desktops these days so just mirror the screen character recognizeparse what it sees on the screen perform some action on that data and send the result to the keyboard after positioning the mouse to where it needs to be.gtSeems ridiculous but there have been numerous times in my IT career where having this sort of device would have done my job for me.

5629522,1,t1_cwus1ge,Thankfully men havent been controlling womens lives for the past millenium. I dont know where this canard came from I lie  I know exactly where it came from but it really needs to be put to bed.Since the dawn of Homo sapiens humans have subsisted. Youre familiar with this word? It means to survive in a minimalist way. Life was hard for everyone. Most people died before the age of . Owing to our dichotomous mammalian sex pairings the nuclear family evolved quite naturally for many reasons. Specialisation kept us alive. Men were stronger and faster and it made sense for them to hunt. Women could bear children and were better multitaskers making them better suited for raising children and working in the relative safety of the group.This nuclear family concept permeates society because up until just a century ago it was a necessity to survive. Then something remarkable happened in the early th century processed food. Processed baby food. Processed bread. Processed cheese. Processed meat. What would once take a housewife three hours to prepare for her family could take minutes. Processed food was the catalyst for a revolution in women in the workforce. But change doesnt happen overnight. We are still struggling with certain attitudes which may take another few generations to completely eliminate. A tradition which is literally built into our genes does not die overnight.So no women were not controlled by men for the past millennium. Both men and women worked together at what they did best so they didnt die. Technology has allowed us to pursue more cerebral endeavours without the nag of hunger and the constant threat of annihilation distracting us.,newzealand,cwuw9lb,-2,t5_2qhma

5631628,0,t1_cwv51ws,Okay Ive heard that Gowers facts on this are bad. Cant prove it but I wouldnt be surprised. Maybe well find out tomorrow. Maybe Im wrong. I often am. There might be a distraction welfare crackdown story tomorrow. Or a misleading profile made public. Anyhow. My initial point was that Key isnt in control of the narrative. Ive read the dead cat analysis and its certainly persuasive. But this isnt Keys style to have to risk a no confidence vote on the Speaker means he lost control of the narrative. Huge confrontations like the rape enablers accusation today dont come often and although the NZ public dont have faith in Labour no one actually believes they support rapists. Aside from Whale Oil and the likes. Key cant trot these sorts of bombastic attacks out too often or the public will get their backs up and catch on. He and his handlers let this get out from under them. Let the story gain too much traction. They got back to the party late and had to make up for lost time in a very clumsy way. Perhaps theyll get the narrative back. Probably will. But for  hours there they dropped the ball. Badly. ,newzealand,cwv5nf6,5,t5_2qhma

Have open homes and be there to supervise and answer questions dress smartly and smile. Make up info packs have information about the schools and shops what bus routes are near have a valuation and a LIM report and information about rates and other important things. Have purchase and sale agreements printed out and available for buyers to take with them. Use trade me and put on as many photos as you can. Nice wide angle shots and watch the exposure as you dont want to have it looking dark and unfriendly and have LARGE clear signs to let people know where to go for open homes.

Why do they not simply compare dollar for dollar salaries for men and women in the same position across a handful of companies in the same industry in the same country?

5791714,0,t3_3ugax7,No need to stress about it I finally did mine recently and it wasnt so bad. Worst case scenario is you have to sit it again. Any time you drive now leading up to the test make sure you dont have any bad habits check your mirrors and blind spots very regularly. Keep an eye on your speed if you do go over you want to bring it back down asap. One thing I didnt do very well was check my blind spot when crossing a cycle lane to turn left even though I knew I hadnt passed any cyclists still needs to be done so beware of that one too. Practice your parallel park you get plenty of time to do it in the test and they make sure youve got lots of space on a quiet street so dont rush take your time. If you havent already get a lesson or two. Theyll check you dont have any bad habits give you tips and youll feel more at ease once they say youll be fine. My friend wasnt an experienced driver but a couple lessons had him passing with ease. Couple tips I rememberGive way or stop sign.. stop completely some of them dont like people rolling at give way signs. They want to see you make safe decisions and stopping completely shows you are ensuring its safe. When stopping behind a car at an intersection or in traffic you should be able to see the bottom of their tyres dont stop too close to people.When at an intersection with no lights they check that you choose a safe gap you can also be marked down for not going when a big enough gap is available.. just dont be the person who sits there when  cars could have safely gone into the gap. A couple days before the test check that all of your lights are working I almost failed due to a tail light not working despite checking it the night before luckily I got it going. check it with enough time to replace a bulb if necessary. ,newzealand,cxf0m9w,2,t5_2qhma

5875188,0,t3_3vq1y4,This experiment has yet to really be performed.There have plenty of approximations generally consisting of welfare benefits of one type or another.Before we get into the details let be clear about what a basic income proposal is about and it is about restructuring wealth distribution.  It is an attempted transference from the  to the farthest end of the long tail completely skipping any sort of trickle down which weve already see over the last  years is pretty much bullshit.  However just as with trickle down economics theres no clear path from the  to the last quartile of the long tail.  Accordingly what guaranteed basic income purports to accomplish is just as suspect as what trickle down economics says it supposedly accomplishes. The pragmatic consensus on basic income schemes is that they will always fail for a variety of reasons.  The primary economic reason these systems fail is due to the current definition of money.  The secondary reinforcing factor for the primary economic reason is human nature.The current definition of money revolves around the obligation of future labor via debt.  Every single dollar ever created after a certain point in history has come into existence because someone somewhere has borrowed money with the promise that a portion of their future labor proceeds will be used to pay back that debt plus some amount interest.  How does that factor into a basic income proposal?  Well that money has to come from somewhere and that somewhere is debt issuance most likely by the government.  Currently the average first world government is allowed to create money at a rate of roughly  to  where the  part is tax revenues.  Presumably if the total national government budget is kept below some fundamental level of GDP this situation is sustainable.  Typically once a nations debt rises above  of GDP that country is going to crash economically.  One other thing to consider about wealth distribution and debt is that the majority of money creation debt issuance comes from the long tail... the .  This is where growth happens in the economy and it happens when people borrow money.  A guaranteed basic income reduces or even eliminates the need for the individual to borrow money but increase the need for the state to create it via debt issuance.  Combine both of these and you have a very effective GDP killer.Secondarily theres this issue of behavioral economics.  Basically people on the  side the produceconsume curve pareto distribution will happily cruise along sans job and never add marginal value to the societyeconomy other than their baseline consumption.  There are some fairly ominous experiments indicate that completely satiating the lower layer of Maslows hierarchy of needs results in unintended and completely unexpected consequences.  In the context of debt issuance money freely available unearned income results in inflation and secondary black market economies to maximize income.With all of that said the current definition of money will have to change before guaranteed basic income will be viable.  The other thing that will probably need to happen is the general mass unemployment due to artificial intelligence and meat space automation.  At that point a guaranteed basic income will become mandatory along with the required redefinition of money.  Over the longer term these is this issue of moving away from growth based economics for the purpose of preserving the planet.  This also necessitates a move away from oil and other fossil fuels which has its own implications for growth  Continuing the idea to its ultimate conclusion there will probably be a migration to a electronic blockchain currency that is contingent upon the full instrumentation of a state owned person where every aspect of their life will be controlled to include movement and caloric intake.  This is the eventual reality that guaranteed basic income ushers in.,newzealand,cxpront,5,t5_2qhma

Then there will be a series of bills introduced to change the legislation and these bills will go through the normal parliamentary process including where the government doesnt urgent the changes the full select committee stages including submissions.  But at the end of the day the legislation must en up being consistent with the TPPA so for example there is no possible way that the copyright term will not be extended to at least  years.

Long story short they were like  bog and when I started pulling the bog out to redo it the timber was wet and had rotted further. They hadnt let them dry our metalx on them or anything. These things were rotten as all hell on the bottom one of the sills fell off. I emailed them and said you werent completely truthful about the condition they were in the inspection I had before I paid they looked nd hand but fine but this rot and stuff you know about from when you tried to paint them yourself can I have like half my money back?No answer from them and I really dont have the inclination to fuck around with trademe staff so I cut my loses and bought brand new ones.

Ive just come to accept the fact that its impossible and impractical in my experience to be vegan for purely ethical reasons as making unethical choices and actions seems to be unavoidable especially if you live in the developed world.Regarding LCysteine its actually possible to derive it synthetically.

The problem with continuing this argument is that safe is a goalpost that can be moved at will to suit any position. But relatively speaking is cannabis safer than alcohol? Of course. Safer than fatty foods? For sure. Safer than sugar? Absolutely.Can this be verified with copious amounts of peer reviewed data? Well its a bit difficult if that same backward thinking is blocking researchers from investigating anything to do with cannabinoids.

Why do we as a society need to pay for the mistakes of our forefathers mistakes that are far out of living memory. If the money paid out in treaty settlements were to create equality as it has been branded is there any empirical evidence to show that is has provided any benefit to the social development of the tribes that it was given to? In the case of university education and the herald expose those are both facts that are documented. In the case of equality how are Maori specifically not equal? What can others do that Maori can not? Why are concessions made on their behalf? In my view it is more condescending to Maori than helpful implying that they cant function in our egalitarian society without a helping hand.    ,newzealand,cz6doat,-1,t5_2qhma

Im a meat eater myself yet I understand why my consumption of meat would appall a lot of people. A meat eater would not make for a good flatmate in this case and everyone would feel massively uncomfortable.The people posting the ad just want to feel safe in their own living situation.

A company must show that the legislation is discriminatory against foreign companies thereby engaging in protectionist which is what we are agreeing not to do.  gtThis means that if protreaty or proMaori legislation is up for debate the government will need to consider whether or not that that encroaches on the profits of corporations and if so whether or not its worth the tradeoff.This is Chapter   EXCEPTIONS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS Within this chapter there is Article .  Treaty of Waitangi which reads thuslygt Article . Treaty of Waitangigt . Provided that such measures are not used as a means of arbitrary orunjustified discrimination against persons of the other Parties or as a disguisedrestriction on trade in goods trade in services and investment nothing in thisAgreement shall preclude the adoption by New Zealand of measures it deemsnecessary to accord more favourable treatment to Maori in respect of matterscovered by this Agreement including in fulfilment of its obligations under theTreaty of Waitangi.gt . The Parties agree that the interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangiincluding as to the nature of the rights and obligations arising under it shall not besubject to the dispute settlement provisions of this Agreement. Chapter Dispute Settlement shall otherwise apply to this Article. A panel establishedunder Article . Establishment of a Panel may be requested to determine onlywhether any measure referred to in paragraph  is inconsistent with a Partysrights under this Agreement.So when protreaty legislation is up for debate the only thing that needs to be considered is are we trying to use this as a way to discriminate against foreign companies rather than to benefit Maori.

I have yet to find a female desperate enough to sleep with me but from what I have gathered from various threads elsewhere on Reddit theres a lot more about how sex actually works that isnt covered in the sex education at school like how you cant pull on a condom and shove your penis inside the vagina just like that. I also dont remember much about masturbation or anything like that and it would probably allay the fears and concerns of many teenagers if they knew that it was OK and that it even has benefits in terms of greater control over orgasms releasing chemicals that help sleep etc. ,newzealand,czszgz6,1,t5_2qhma

Can you please clarify either your or your partys current position on the TPP and the key reasons for this position? Given that such agreements naturally require balancing the pros and cons Id particularly love to hear which cons might be too large for the Green party to support.Second whats your personal opinion on the current RMA reforms? I love the RMA and view it as a landmark piece of legislation but think there is pretty clear evidence that it needs tweaking to streamline the consent process. Nationals proposals in my opinion amount to no more than tinkering at the margin and wont have a substantive impact. Twyford and the NZ Initiative have some really good stuff in this regard and Im interested in the key changes that you would like to see made and the nonnegotiables.Cheers in advance!,newzealand,d0j49tp,8,t5_2qhma

Until she mentioned that the hiring manager is away for all of May and I had to tell her Im away for the last two weeks of April. Which combined with my notice period of a month means I wouldnt be able to start and be trained by the time she goes. Which isnt really acceptable so it looks like Im not able to take the job. It was more money and better working conditions too.And then I come in today and Demon Boss is in a foul mood. She refused to approve the purchase orders because shes in a snit with one of the head office girls. Nevermind the fact that it prevents me from doing my job she doesnt care. She told me that the world doesnt revolve around admin girls ohfuckoff.SO now Im sat here wondering if it would be absolute lunacy to tell the recruitment agent that Ill take the job if they want me and Ill start Monday.

The simple fact is we need to provide suitable employent for all of the citizens living in our country first before we worry about overseas organizations. If you can show me a study that shows losing employment to foreign entities is improving our wages and industry for the average worker I would love to see it. If people dont have a job that supports them and allows them to live and generate tax with minimal government welfare support.

If its less than  then you dont need to bother with a second referendum and save the dosh. . If the proposed flag fails in the second referendum then youll have an idea why it failed. Was it lack of support in the first place? People ended up not liking the new flag in the end? We dont really know with the current system. ,newzealand,d18rl5r,4,t5_2qhma

6999823,0,t1_d19rg1l,Up until recently I was working with schools in Australia as part of the Australian Seismometers in Schools Network. There are several times in the general science curriculum where geoscience is taught. I also like to encourage physics teachers to use seismology since it is essentially the study of waves travelling through the earth. The senior science courses there do include an earth and environmental science option. My hope is that it is improving but we need to support teachers by providing them with appropriate resources. My favourite seismic signal wasnt that odd but it was some students I was working with who found it. They were doing a project on noise that a seismometer that I installing in their school was recording. They found that there was some electronic noise from a heater turning on and off in the room next door. Those students were super seismic sluths. ,newzealand,d19rv92,2,t5_2qhma

7034152,0,t3_4byyyv,Supermarkets make their profits charging a small profit margin on a huge volume and range of goods.   Customers will go to the place with good they want at the cheapest price.         Supermarkets can screw their wholesalers to get goods for cheaper.A Govt run supermarket cant screw kiwi wholesalers without their MP getting drowned in bad publicity.     A govt run supermarket charging a few percent more than the competition will lose customers and so will lose volume so their fixed costs will become a problem.       And thats before the foreign owned companies play dirty they hire any good staff away offering bigger paychecks.  They do a Saudi and leveraging overseas funds they drop their NZ margins  so there is zero or negative profit And huge costs and risk in NZ  until their rivals are asphyxiated.    They demand first pick of wholesale product so the smaller Govt stores only get second rate goods.     The NZ Govt is not a rich pool of money and talent.   Supermarkets are lean and mean and keep a couple of thousand plates spinning in the air every day using a centuries old pool of institutional knowledge.      My only suggestion for monopoly breaking would be to do what we did with service stations.   Make any failure at any site be legally the responsibility of the owner company.

Rainfall can reach  mm during a span of  hoursSo that means that it rains at least every second day with winter averages much higher.Guys that were on the Routeburn with us had just come off the Milford track last week and had  days of pissing down rain and finally got helicoptered out because everything was flooding and dangerous.Now add in to that mix the reality of winter conditions when much of that rain would actually have been snow ice and sleet rather than rain and freezing and they also remove several of the bridges during the winter. Any area that they consider to be an avalanche risk they physically remove the bridge completely by helicopter during winter so that they dont get destroyed. They do this on the Routeburn and Keplar as well.

Hong Kong introduced double stamp duty on second properties and foreign ownership in . The  fiscal year netted them  BILLION in that revenue segment alone. Edit An increase of  so this figure includes normal first home stamp duty too.Different market. And one could argue that Hong Kong is crashing.

These guys I know didnt get money from their parents either they just did trades instead of uni.As for breaks theres where collective bargaining comes into power. Heavily unionised jobs are having much less of a problem than others. Maybe Im just out of touch because I spent half a decade in hospo where the laws were actively ignored as well as most health and safety laws and plenty more employment laws. I never really got breaks working in hospo if I did it was usually right at the end of the shift when wed stop for dinner but I have worked gt hour breaks in the past with only a single half hour break.I guess the problem is that the new laws dont factor for dickheads of which there are apparently too many. Maybe the trials should be shorter it does make sense to have them you can only figure out so much about a worker from an interview. Maybe they need to add in a minimum break allowance or write into law the specified alternative the old system was far to rigid though. Hell schools have technically been breaking the law on break times for teachers for decades.I guess I spent too long in hospo to give a fuck about any of that any more.,newzealand,d1mvywt,1,t5_2qhma

In reality the American Temperament Test Society has statistics that show that pitbull breeds are as likely to pass their test as golden retrievers.Pass rates American Pitbull terrier .

7331297,0,t1_d2a7ndc,Yeah Im fed up with this stereotype now. We dont live in America personal risk insurances including income protection are subject to a fair amount of regulation in NZ. The vast vast majority of declined claims in NZ are declined solely as a result of material client nondisclosure at application time. This means that the applicant failed ro disclose one or more preexisting medical conditions which would have materially impacted on the acceptance of the policy had that information been available to the underwriter at application time. These insurance contracts by law operate on a basis of utmost good faith  you are required to disclose all relevant information requested by the provider during the underwriting process. This allows the insurer to assess individual risk and issue acceptance terms which cannot subsequently be changed on those benefits as long as you hold them.Where claims are declined a client can request that the ISO Insurance and Savings Ombudsman review the decision. This review process involves reviewing the underwriting guidelines of the company in question along with multiple competitors to check whether the retrospective underwriting decision leading to the declined claim is prudent and fair  if it isnt the ombusdman can compel the provider to reinstate cover at original acceptance terms and pay the claim. ,newzealand,d2bio75,3,t5_2qhma

But thats not to say women arent joining. Every year the proportion of women in the military is increasing and it was increasing before this gender neutral bullshit came out. The nature of a defence force is going to attract more men than women and it sure isnt because of the term man in titles.gtBut you also seem to be really attached to The Way Things Are and using that as an excuse to not Make Things Better.This doesnt make anything better though. All it does is create a ridiculous waste of time and resources when the NZDF priority should be in a completely different place right now. Maybe more towards improving our operational capability from being a liability in an allied task group into being a modern and effective small nation armed force.gtConserving tradition should never be an excuse for anything really... Plenty of traditions are damaging and should be abolished. Im sure the navy will be okay without tradition. Itll change obviously but that isnt a bad thing.And this is why civilians do not run the defence force and why the MoD should ideally have a background in the NZDF.

I used the expression the electorate because I was referring to polls of likely voters. I used it as a shorthand for the majority of the electorate but that was pretty obvious.There are two groups of people keeping the left out swing voters and nonvoters. When you have a majority of the electorate that favours increasing taxes to cover health and educationwhich is a fairly consistent result of pollingthat is a clear sign that swing voters on aggregate are okay with that.Perhaps those swing voters have a better understanding of the relationship between taxes public services and their wellbeing than you are giving them credit.However often youve heard these arguments from people unlike me ie. people who think it is Labours turn next time you have made no credible argument about how Labours policy is an impediment.What youve also missed is this labours policies have not been an impediment but they will not win office unless National mysteriously implodes or they become credible. I agree with you that Labour will not achieve victory through policy they will win it through being coherent and focused and having clear support partners.Your conviction that the left cant win an election is bunk. It has happened in  amp  and it will happen again. I dont think it is likely in this election the most likely outcome is that NZF holds the balance of power.You are missing where the disagreement is here. You have been asserting that Labours policies are an impediment to attracting swing voters and I have disagreed. We have both argued that policy is not the definitive or only issue and that the reality that Labour has not looked credible for other reasons is a large part of the explanation of their failure.,newzealand,d3r4u3l,1,t5_2qhma

I remember when it closed because suddenly the only way I could visit my granny without my parents was the bus. The service quality on trains was greatly decreased despite the prices rising anyway. They used to provide snacks during the journey and then they started charging and made those prices way too high. They closed the rural stops and so we couldnt take the train all the way to our destination. Im not surprised it closed considering that all decisions were so detrimental to the quality and usability after it was privatised and sold to Faye and Richwhite. They stripped it of its assets and now we dont have a functioning rail service and rely on more and more roads which require more and more maintenance as we allow heavier and heavier trucks to more freight around the country. If the government was willing to subsidise rail to the same extent as they subsidise the trucking industry through road maintenance then rail would be economical. The road user charges that the trucking companies pay are not in proportion to the amount of damage the heavy trucks do to our roads.

They only make you feel good because the addiction was making you feel bad a minute earlier.Even if you totally ignore all the other health effects like how they kill you and the monetary cost cigarettes make smokers feel worse overall and increase their misery.If people can be prevented from taking up smoking in the first place theyll be better off and higher prices will contribute to that.I think the government should also be promoting healthy nonaddictive alternatives. legaliseit blazeit vapeweedeveryday weedcurescancer,newzealand,d4obk3v,1,t5_2qhma

8274543,1,t1_d5buyln,You might have skipped over this part of my above commentgtPeople who dont like Japanese food arent threatened with rape to fix them they arent told their sexuality doesnt exist they arent told that they dont know what theyre talking about as though they dont know their own minds and bodies  all things that have happened to either myself or other members of the group I admin.I know people who have been raped as an attempt at fixing their asexuality. I know women who have been beaten by their partners who were at first accepting of their asexuality for not wanting to have sex with them because itd been months and surely theyd gotten over it by now? I know people who have been depressed and near suicide because they felt so out of place within a society where to not have sex somehow makes you less and until they found the term asexual thought they were broken. Im incredibly lucky  Ive been threatened by strangers but then that can happen to anyone on Tinder in direct correlation to my asexuality  but Ive never had to worry about my familys response or been raped or beaten because of it.So no perhaps we dont see the same issues that we do with LGBT as I said above  we face different struggles. But we do face struggles and as a very small group within society is it any wonder everyone else doesnt know about these issues?? Its one of the reasons why I wanted to write this article  to open up discussion about the more serious problems that aces face. As for your point about the wider LGBTQA community  I obviously cannot speak for anyone other than myself but Ive only ever been met with acceptance in those spaces. At the Reflections on Orlando evening in Christchurch I was directly told that you are part of this community too. We dont have the same history as homosexuals just as homosexuals dont have the same history as trans or even lesbians. That does not exclude us from our community. And again please remember that you can be gay and asexual. You can be trans and asexual. Asexuals represent the broadest variety of people even if were the smallest percentage. So yeah  we definitely belong in the LGBTQ community.And  apologies if this comes across as a little defensive but its late and am honestly just so fucking tired of every discussion regarding asexuality turning into people questioning every single experience Ive had in order for me to somehow prove my asexuality to them this constant need I have to justify myself to strangers or else be told my sexuality and the experiences of that sexuality that I and others have are invalid.. But anyway my point was this as with racism generally speaking if you arent experiencing it yourself you dont get to tell others that it doesnt exist. You dont get to tell me issues with asexuals dont exist because youve never seen or experienced them unless you yourself are asexual  and honestly even then you need to be aware that your experiences are relative to you only. I have had it very fucking easy in my life  my friends and family are supportive and loving Ive never been beaten or raped. But as the mod to the FB group Im the one people often go to privately for advice or just to chat to  so I am very aware that many others arent as lucky. My good does not mean their bad is nonexistent and vice versa. It just means I need to listen when they talk about the shit they go through and be able to notice patterns and recognise that there are similar experiences that we all share  though some in more extremes than others.Editing with some links because I obviously cannot give out private information for you to talk to the people Ive mentioned above.Battling Asexual Discrimination  please excuse the fact that its HuffPoAsexual Survivors have simply linked to the website theres a variety of stuff thereIll try and find a sociology study I read a few years back but thatll have to do for tonight sorry Im exhausted that Pokemon GO man Ive havent walked so much since school camps!,newzealand,d5bvka4,6,t5_2qhma

Sitting on a section big enough to maybe not fit an entire other apartment block but definitely add another rds to the one that is in progress. And you can bet that developer tried to do just that. One elderly man lives there. It looks so absurd Im half expecting to see a million balloons tied to his house one morning.The rest of the street and the two either side and I mean ALL of it is tiny little character cottages. Some in pretty bad shape. Some very obviously converted to luxury homes. While I agree Ponsonby is not as sparse as other suburbs other suburbs arent in the heart of the city. Ponsonby is. People are there for the City. Thats it. If they werent they would have gone to another suburb where their money would go further.Living amongst all that I say you are the one being ridiculous by thinking it should come even close to being maintained that way.

So I provide said assesor with the information along with emails showing dates and information I had emailed AMI. gtA week later no word from AMI or assessor as to whats happening so I call the call center talking to claims agent Richard he points out that AMI has been behind with emails and have a backlog that theyre working through !?!?! Like what the hell??!! Was anyone going to tell me about this??? gtI asked for a supervisor and I get superbly wonderful Toni or Tony. Who was as helpful as a brick. Refused to give me herhis last name  I couldnt tell if this was a male or female points out that my case is being handled by the investigator  Was I to be told about that?!!? Should I have been told about it??! Doesnt tell me if Im to contact said investigator could not tell me even approximate date when investigator would contact me Could not logically understand why I was angry about having to provide information that AMI should of had in the first place to the assessor. gtIn short Toni was just a useless waste of time. gtMiraculously though I get a call from AiG investigator asking to meet and discuss my claim...which happens days after claim being made. Not surprisingly meeting with investigator was akin to talking to Toni save for his standard comment of  Each claim is different and no two are the same explanation as to why I am dealing with an investigator and again having to provide emails of items and information that AMI should of already had on file!! So after taking a voice recording of me talking about the circumstances around the theft and the items that Im claiming for he left..... gt Days ticked by and I called him up only to be told by him at that time that he was waiting on an email about an item that I was claiming for and had he received received said email he could submit his report to AMI who in turn would make a decision on my claim??!. gtTo say Im pissed now is an understatement of note! gtAMI must think Im some ignorant brokeass that probably cant afford the items Im claiming for!! Their bullshit and delaying is because they had stuffed up and either lost my information or their brilliant staff like Toni did a halfassed job in the first place!! But you were happy to take payment from me??! Now you want to try and prove what exactly???That I didnt own the things or is it that I cant afford things like that??? Black people and black immigrants quite often have alot more money than you think AMI. gtSo grow a pair AMI take responsibility for your stuffup and Il take responsibility for choosing a xenophobic racist bigoted company for contents cover. And if youre still being sore about having to payout my claim Ill be happy to have my policy fees repaid in full a full copy of all my policy information along with details of mine you hold and a written apology because had you done your work properly this probably would of never happened!!! ,newzealand,d5pc2d2,13,t5_2qhma

You will never ever see an AP story with the words suicide or si in them because we had trouble with Spanish stuff in the English feed. Also because it was just safer never to mention suicide period. That includes stories about suicide bombers or financial suicide unfortunately. Blanket ban.A short while after that the coroner relaxed the rules on reporting suicides because they felt that underreporting them wasnt as helpful as they originally thought. Now curated stories involving suicide always include a footer with some helplines in them and can mention that a death was suicide if it was notable in any way. Joe Bloggs is still reported as no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death as its not necessarily in the public interest to highlight the cause of death. Always look for the footer if youre not sure how they passed.,newzealand,d6nd9ma,2,t5_2qhma

9012555,0,t1_d7ucwrl,gt MAKE A CONDITIONAL OFFER.Actually if you really want a property its best to make an unconditional offer especially in a tender situation. Get your building report and LIM before the tender date. The least appealing offer to a vendor is conditional on finance. Especially if someone else is putting in an unconditional cash offer even if it less than what youre offering. You will miss out on the house. I will note here something people may not know A vendor is under no obligation to accept any offer in a tender. They also do not have to take the highest offer. They could choose the lowest or none at all. A tender is the best situation for a vendor as all the potential buyers are blindly putting in their best bet to buy the house and the vendor gets to see them all at once and then make a decision they usually have  hours. The vendor can also choose to negotiate with a potential buyer. Another important note is that you can put in an offer before a tender date if it says By Tender unless sold prior. We did this and although our offer was rejected before the tender date because they thought theyd get a higher price at tender they called us after the tender date and offered us the house if we would increase our price a little. This is where we played hard ball and Uhmed and Ahed over it said yes okay we will increase our price. We said wed send them the SampP documentation with the new price. We only increased by k.

Hard to tell the exact numbers from the data but seems like just less than  prisoners are aged .  prisoners are Maori and another  are Polynesian. These groups are over represented amongst rugby players. Most Mitre Ten Cup teams have at least  players in their squadsThe point is not that this has anything to do with rugby but it does have something to do with the demographics who play rugby. Young Maori men are statistically more likely to commit violence than other groups. The question is why is that so? Tew thinks that people who commit violence need support and that they need to look at ways to help players. He gives an example of George Moala who also received a discharge without conviction for a violent assault received subsequent support has not reoffended and is involved in educating other players.I dont understand your second point at all.

9227889,0,t3_56r83h,In  my father walked around the South Island. Earlier this year he attempted to walk the length of the North Island. For both of these walks he had a support vehicle with people to ferry him to and from his accommodation and to escort him through the more dangerous bits of the road. Here are a few of the issues that he encountered along the way You need to choose your time of year very carefully. Summer is too hot and has very busy traffic during the school holidays. Autumn is quite wet and you run the risk of bad weather setting in before you finish. Winter is cold and shitty. Late winterearly spring seems to be the best but you may run into an unseasonable cold snap like this winters Gisborne snowfall. There are a lot of isolated areas at the top of the South Island. Theres very few signs of civilisation between Blenheim and Kaikoura if you want to go round the other way there are some rather empty patches of countryside down the West Coast and on LewisPortersArthurs pass too. If you are planning to walk this bit without support you will need to carry your shelter with you and spend time and energy each day on setting this up and taking it down. The mighty Rakaia River. I went for a drive around the South Island with him in  to help plan the route and we attempted to get from Christchurch to Dunedin without touching SH. We almost managed it albeit only because the rivers were pretty dry and even then Miss Learner Driver here accidentally put the WD car into a couple of very nonWD situations. The only bit we joined back onto SH for was the Rakaia River as there are no fords near the coast and a detour via SH would have taken us too long. The Rakaia River bridge on SH is the longest in NZ at .km and it is not overly wide. Personally Ive walked a few bridges in km zones while hitchhiking and even those with lots of room feel terrifyingly narrow when theres a truck coming  I would not be brave enough to attempt the Rakaia bridge. He had a police escort when he crossed it. His feet. Dear god. His actual fitness wasnt too bad but he had shocking blisters after two days and before long the blisters blisters had blisters. By the end of six weeks his feet were downright gruesome to look at or even to be in the same room with him when he was in bare feet and I have some images from that which I would dearly love to erase from my memory. One of his lucky support crew would get the delightful job of changing the dressings and I was so grateful that I managed to dodge this as I dont think I could have stomached it.He kept a blog of his travels which you might find interesting if you have a few hours to spare.,newzealand,d8lpawc,1,t5_2qhma

9283844,0,t1_d8sqc25,Newshub linkThat Newshub link a really glimpse into what looks like a very interesting dataset. Ill see if I can find the rest of it.Bear in mind before you jump to conclusions that these areas are not equal in size. Youre not comparing similarlysized areas. The median area unit has about  people.WillisSt Cambridge Terrace has a population of  which makes it the th largest of the  area units in the country. More importantly it has around  workers which make it I think the th largest labour destination. There are also  people working in the neighbouring Lambton area unit.So you have  people living and working there plus people who come in for shoppingrecreationtourism plus evening spillover from the  workers in Lambton. These are population numbers that only compare with Lambton and Auckland West and East which are both on the list.A typical area unit would have maybe  people livingworkingvisiting and would cover a whole residential suburb or rural area.Im not saying that there isnt any connection to alcohol consumption but clearly a large part of the reason that Te Aro is exceptional by this measure is that more people are inhabiting the area. Its not surprising that crime happens in proportion to the number of people occupying an area.This is really just a cautionary tale about statistics especially clickbaity ones with a top  list format and ones that use arbitrary geographic boundaries.Alcohol harmBut moving on I dont deny that alcohol consumption carries the risk of harm. As Ive argued elsewhere on this thread sport has harm too. Plenty of things have harm.We cant live life without harm. From a public policy perspective there are two things we should be considering are there price signals that capture the cost of this harm to individuals making free decisions spoiler yes there are and do we have public policy interventions that will reduce the harm without undue burden to consumers.The first issue are there price signals. Yes we have a significant excise tax on alcohol. If my recollection of the Royal Commission is correct after quantifying all the costs of harm including ACC etc the total value of harm was substantially less than the revenue from excise tax. In other words drinkers are buying insurance with their drink that more than covers the costs associated with the harm if something goes wrong.Second do we have interventions that will reduce the harm? Well we have interventions like closing bars early and lockouts and perpurchase limits in stadiums etc. Ive yet to see any evidence that any of these interventions actually reduces harm.Take am closing for example. Do people actually drink less? Or do they just drink at home? Do they start drinking earlier? Do they drink more quickly? What effect does everyone leaving the bar at the same time have on harm? Does it create more trouble on the street? Do we need to have more police out to police the sudden spike of people on the street?None of the reactionary ideas for how to reduce alcohol consumption seem to pass the smell test. They just sound like kneejerk suggestions that create as many problems as they solve.But worse its not just tinkering with the formula for a new pharmaceutical. These kind of policies get up in peoples liberties. They stop a willing pub owner and a willing patron from engaging in a free commercial transaction because you want those transactions to be limited to particular hours or whatever the rule is.If youre going to push people around like that you better have a really strong argument to show why your am closing idea is going to make a significant tangible difference to how much alcohol harm we have. Or the same for whatever idea it is youre pushing.Alcohol benefitsAs for stats the other way its really had to get them. I dont know of anyone whos studying say the number of successful long term relationships that were founded when one party or other steeled their nerves with half a glass of beer and asked the other to dance.Whether you like it or not alcohol is an important part of our culture we use it to make our triumphs more glorious and our defeats more manageable. Most people most of the time dont suffer harmful affects from alcohol. Its just there like caffeine and prayer as an ingredient in the complicated social lives we live.If you could measure it properly I would imagine that alcohol has a net positive effect on most peoples lives most of the time. Thats evidenced by the fact that people are willing to pay a premium to drink alcohol rather than say water.If you only look at the negative side of the ledger thats all youre going to see.,newzealand,d8ssm94,2,t5_2qhma

9455286,0,t3_59zxcf,How interesting. Im a qualified lawyer wondering about going into IT. Ha.Law is a varied profession. It is hard yakka getting there but no harder than other highintensity degrees. It is alot of reading so be prepared for that. I think its worth looking at what sort of lifestyle you are after. Buying a small firm in the provinces would tick some of your boxes   community type work high client engagement etc. Working ina  firm in a major center will deliver on thsoe fronts but it will be many years before you are doing much more than that. There are quite alot of smallmid sized law firms about now sometimes called boutique which are interesting but again it s a multiyear investment though quicker than a big tier firm.Other options include working in inhouse legal roles with one client being your employer think general counsel for a big corporate or indeed government either in Crown Law or in any government department they all have lawyers. As for getting a job there is a huge glut in the market of lawyers with  years experience because most people go off shore at that point for the big bucks. Entry level is competitive but if you have unique experiences and are a bit older you shuoldnt have a problem. Networking and lining yourself up with a job before you leave uni is the way to manage that.I think its a great and varied profession which is intellectually stimulating. It has its downsides of course which is why Im looking at IT! but every job does. Before making the jump I would ask though what is it you really want? Is it legal study? Or is it more engagement with the publicclients? There are other jobs out there that will give you the latter without excessive study ... ,newzealand,d9eiwbm,3,t5_2qhma

I think shes a far better candidate than Trump but I still dont trust her all that much.I think if a more trustworthy establishment candidate had been fielded  Biden perhaps  it would have been a much better option.Bernie had a chance but Bernie was to Democrats what Trump was to Republicans. Extreme beyond the establishment difficult to align with and support.Im interested to see how effective Trump is as president.

I expect some of his other reforms will be easy enough the things that have been part of the Republican Platform since . Others? I dont see them going so well.

9683383,0,t1_da6lj6a,Yes. What matters is the amount of maple trees you have. If you have several trees with a diameter of at least two feet the tree will produce roughly enough sap within a week to give you close to ml of syrup once boiled down. I mean shit thats enough syrup to leisurely enjoy with your breakfast for a few times at least. Plus its homemade and itll taste even better because its yours and literally every syrup taste different based on the environment the tree grows in. So itll also be unique to your geographical local.Anyway heres the part you need to understand most. All maple trees produce sap which inherently has sugar. Sugar maples have on average four times the amount of sugar  in their sap than say a red maple which has about . This means your yield of syrup will be much higher with a sugar maple as it will require less time and energy to boil evaporate the water away. Which is subsequently why its called a sugar maple and is used most commonly in a legitimate maple syrup production farm. However you can boil regular maple sap from any maple to produce maple syrup. The sap from any old maple just produces less sugar and therefore requires more sap to produce more maple syrup. So if you have some on your property I suggest tapping them. Give it a whirl and see what your results are. Its an incredibly fun hobby. Also pm me if you need advice on how to do it with limited resources. Orrrr I can type that in here too.

I enjoyed playing with my cat and my dog and then eating my cows and that was that  fuck off vegans etc etc. I became interested in eating less meat through research supporting the environment and through findings which support the use of less animal products for health. Only later did the cognitive hurdles involved with eating meat become a bit more apparent. Melanie Joy summarises this with her excellent book Why we love dogs eat pigs and wear cows.

9790154,0,t1_dajs78d,The same older people that paid for the infrastructure used by todays youth.Its not so clear cut when looked at that way. Ever since there has been a pension of some sort in this country it has been paid for out of the tax of the current working generation from its very outset. What youre saying is that you want to break a social contract with people that have worked and upheld their end for literally decades  almost their entire lives.I dont think you can break that sort of trust lightly or on the basis of trite soundbites like old landed gentry. The minute that you do you advertise that potentially everything is up for grabs. Societies function because people believe in them. Breaking trust with old people is a good way of convincing people that maybe society isnt working so great any more and they should lookout for themselves maybe by trying harder to structure their affairs now in a way that means they pay less tax and can consequently save more for themselves.As far as a universal allowance  sure Im a fan. Universal NZ Super effectively is a universal allowance given once you reach a certain age. The underpinning assumption is that you have worked and been productive throughout your life and now the youth that are enjoying the society that your labour built can contribute to looking after you in your old age. I dont think that people who have managed to save some money andor assets for themselves should be punished for that.Every penny that someone has to their name when they arrive at retirement age is a penny that they didnt spend on themselves at some point in their life prior. Start means testing NZ Super and watch a lot more people fritter their savings away prior to reaching retirement age.,newzealand,dajul2b,1,t5_2qhma

9806800,0,t1_dalvffo,So basically yes when Nick left it was bad for Labour. That was a long time ago an unsuccessful mayoral bid ago. So that was that. At the time he got called right wing by Andrew Little and it was seen as a bad move leaving a centre leftie out of the tent. All played badly for Labour.     Now Nick has revealed his true colours. He is no longer a disillusioned Labour man. He is a National member and likely soon a candidate.     If you want to look at Nicks move as representing a general shift of his type of person away from Labour to National then yes thats a bad thing. HeinigerNZs reply to my comment is totally valid.      But Im looking at at his actions as an individual someone who once represented disillusioned Labour had revealed himself to actually feel more comfortable on the right side of politics. It is good for Labours current path to have unity across the factions and having one member of one faction saying really I am simply right wing tbh helps that.     ,newzealand,dalwcqs,6,t5_2qhma

Not that he particularly conveyed much of an opinion other than one of asking to be informed if hes wrong.Human rights are still subjective though based on personal opinions as humans that we are deserving of some kind of rights theyre also heavily influenced by emotion like empathy anger and sympathy.They didnt respect my opinion and they were right not toThat phrase right there kind of saddens me i was raised with  sisters beautiful women kind caring. I had a mother that worked two jobs when I was young to help provide. But the idea that women have to wear make up at work or have to go in to certain job fields is a concept maintained predominantly by women now.Just like the idea that Men all have to be muscle men that provide for the family or work office jobs and not be stay at home dads was a predominantly male concept still maintained by  you got it. Men.I dont believe we live in a patriarchal society atleast here in new zealand and I know you wont respect that I think that way.The law system very much favors women the working class favors men. These are segregated ideals that suck for everyone the people that dont fit in there are trans people  I think they have a pretty shitty deal.  My cousin heads a prison reform movement for trans and indigenous people in new zealand and my auntie wrote her phd thesis on the same subject.

9952961,0,t1_db4vtp0,i am not well versed with US prisoner demographics i just had a bit of a look and while it is not quite as bad as ours in terms of comparable percentages it is close and very skewed to the minority demographic.i was very surprised viewing the US demographics as their population so much larger than ours yet they have essentially the same problem.after some thought i have come to the conclusion that this problem started when the British ruled the countries.they viewed darker skinned people as lesser than white people and treated them accordingly. i think this has had a significant and lasting effect on the mindset and behavior of people born into these minority cultures even now when it is not happening. only very recently has it actually stopped being considered normal to not think less of black people only in the last  years has it gone from literal slavery to equality and for most of that equality did not mean what it does now. only very recently have many white nations gone from oppressing dark skinned people to not. these events have lasting effects on a population i think the solutions that work with white people will not work with them because of the social difference that white people have created over the last handful of centuries.i think this also goes a long way to explaining why there are no actually successful countries run by black people. vast amounts of black people populated areas at some point in the last  years or so has been under white rule being exploited for their resources. it is this exploitation that helped give rise to white society and keep black society from advancing at the same rate. i think the solution is significantly improved educational policies and infrastructure.

In many cases this means we would have to travel much further to another office when we have a mandatory appointment.Even being escorted out would be bad because it would mean they do not complete our paperwork and we get cut off. This means that even if we know they have made an error we must be polite and patient and come back again.I think that the lack of accountability there makes it a good place to work for people who would not do well in a workplace that had higher standards.,newzealand,db9j1ow,1,t5_2qhma

10029231,0,t1_dbeh87v,As to your first point they didnt just agree to everything but one point police patrolling thats a common misunderstanding. You are correct that they agreed to some but many of the points they sort of diplomatically dodged they kind of agreed to them but it is believed that they were not really going to carry them all out.As to your last point you are correct. But you fail to mention that there were also people in Germany that didnt want things to head to war and people in Britian and Russia who very much wanted war. ie every country had warmongers and pacifists which fits my belief that all the countries involved should take a share of the blame much more than it fits the view of some maybe not you but others on this thread who think the blame lies with just one country or with just the Central Powers. Also I must apologize I made a typo in my previous statement. I referred to Serbs under AustriaHungarian control. You then made a comment about an occupied country fighting back. I meant to refer to Serbia wanting control over Slavs under the control of AustriaHungary. They shared a common ethnic background with the Serbs but were not Serbs. This ethnic background was the basis for Serbia wanting them as part of a greater Slavic nation but it was for Serbia own interests not the Slavic peoples interest. Franzferdinand wanted to elevate the importance of these Slavs within the empire something that would have given them greater powerinfluence he had good intentions towards them it would have become more of a AustriaHungarySlaviv Empire. And of course when the Serbs did get control of these Slavs it didnt exactly work out great as I mentioned earlier with Yugoslavia breaking down and war crimes. My point is that Serbia was likely no more nobly minded towards said Slavs than Franzferdinand was.,newzealand,dbeu4kk,6,t5_2qhma

They could sell stock to first home buyers and it would potentially bring about those benefits youve listed. But this wouldnt help those who are candidates for or users of social housing. gtThere is no way that australian firm was going to pay anything near market price for these state homes and these nz landlord vultures lobbying the government wont pay market either they are cruising for a steal and trying to dress it up like they are wanting to do something charitable.fuck off.I dont think any of the CHPs that pick up old HNZ stock will pay market rates for them because they dont have the capital. Even if a CHP is partnered with commercial developers theyll probably still get some discount partly because the senior leadership in this government are keen to get some movement on this program for both ideological the desire to divest from state assets and political reasons the desire to be seen as doing something in social housing. The difference between the Australian group and the APIA group is that the Aussie group is actually an experienced nonprofit provider of social housing It would be taking up stock as a CHP and in all likelihood to get that sort of accreditation theyd need to establish some relationship with local social sector groups.

10112375,0,t1_dbpmj6e,Note also that if you rent from someone living in the house either the owner or what is typically called the head flatmate with you then you are not a tenant under law and you have just about none of the rights or responsibilities of tenants because your living arrangement is not covered by the Residential Tenancies Act. In particular If you are asked for a bond there is no requirement for it to be lodged with the Tenancy Tribunal. There are no formal requirements for notice from either party for ending the arrangement. It is permissible to discriminate against flatmates on grounds prohibited by the Human Rights Act in other contexts e.g. you can be refused on the basis of sex or race.In such cases it is advisable to draw up a contract covering basic rights and responsibilities of each party.

Liberals dont understand Conservatives and Whites generally dont understand nonWhites.

Finally we were recommended a listing by our mortgage broker that his friend had told him about that was like the houses we were pulling reports for. Only thing was the photos looked shithouse. On the way to look at the house I was having a massive sulk where I basically intimated we were wasting our time and that it would be a dump because what place looks better than the listing pictures after all?We really liked the house.Three days after that our conditional offer was accepted and we completed our due diligence.

10364610,0,t1_dcisurl,Nonsense. Its just BS cricket. This covers just what I said in the post they did this because they were LOSING.Here is the coach trying to defend what his players didgtBlack Caps coach Mike Hesson will be quite happy if he never sees another hook shot from Neil Wagner.gtBut he wont be reining in his combative fast bowler with ball in hand and insists his bouncer barrage is within the rules and designed to take wickets not injure a batsman.gtShortpitched bowling and batsman safety was under the spotlight again in the wake of New Zealands sevenwicket victory over Bangladesh in the first cricket test in Wellington.Here is another person opining that what is being played isnt cricket. gtThankfully Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim was cleared of cricket ballrelated injury after undergoing xrays at Wellington Hospital.gtBut that sick feeling in the pit of the stomach everyone had at the Basin Reserve watching Mushfiqur motionless on his back on the pitch as an ambulance drove out should be further evidence for crickets governing body to take stronger action.gtUmpires need to be told that what we witnessed the last two days in the first test cannot be tolerated and bowlers need to be issued much stricter warnings when its clear theyre aiming for the chest neck or head region over a prolonged period.gtNew Zealand adopted that tactic with Wagner because hes tireless its been successful and because theyre bereft of other options. On flat pitches with the ball not swinging its the default method a concession that nothing else is working.gtAfter Mushfiqur scored  in the first innings then began to defy them in the second innings it was seen as the only way to remove him and Tim Southee got in on the shortpitched act. Angling in from around the wicket a short one didnt get up Mushfiqur turned his back and ducked into it. It wasnt malicious from Southee but continued a concerted tactic against a batsman nursing a badly bruised finger and thumb from short deliveries in the first innings.gtThe ball hit him on the back of the neck but the impact was taken by the helmet. It was close to the area Australian Phillip Hughes was hit when he died during a Sheffield Shield match in  a terrible event that prompted crackdowns on helmet safety.,newzealand,dciw2hu,1,t5_2qhma

10475854,0,t1_dcvidrn,What health problems should be fix? As for job opportunities maybe people need to look at a different career. You see you cant just pull jobs out of thin air and you cannot blame the government that you may have a student loan. nice one labour. You see their needs to be a demand and a financial way to stimulate that demand. For example someone might want to be a doctor or nurse. Not that is a bad profession but there is going to be limited spots annually. Im sure if we had the most healthy population on the planet that  need for doctors and other medical professionals would drop so would the opportunities. You can have it both ways its quite close minded to expect the government or business owners to create jobs when the demand is not there. No business will do that they are there to run a successful  business. So when you say job opportunities you really need to be more accurate with what it is you want. Sometimes dreams will have to die but if you are really focused on that dream you will get what you want. Personally i am for less regulations. Call me what you want but the government should be focusing on opening new avenues not managing them. I do agree to an extent that people who large property portfolios should be taxed in a fair manner. It is essential a manipulation of the market. Should someone be punished for owning two investment properties most definitely not. Particularly when you people abuse it the way they are they are out pricing local people. Aucklanders for an example might start buying up property in smaller towns where the average income is for lower some are even looking for quick investment returns. Slowly pricing locals out of the market. ,newzealand,dcvjov2,-4,t5_2qhma

10600163,1,t1_dd9a8it,Most schools already have compulsory Maori between years  where there isnt quite the same pressure on classroom time. I did it from years  as it was also compulsory in year  at my high school.The only lessons worthwhile were the ones that focused on culture rather than the language itself. I essentially learnt my mihi counting and colors for  years and the benefits for learning other languages were at best minimal.Current language teaching in NZ is at the point that you only begin on the road to fluency from at best year  onwards. There is next to no consistency between the years .There is also very little available time in years  and  as they also need to cram in PEHealth and social studies on top of the core  subjects English Math Science. Adding another compulsory subject would impact on the few choices they do get to make and likely get in the way of actually starting another working language.As for the examples given for countries where a second language is compulsory most of them have English or another major language like French compulsory. As the worlds primary working language this provides massive benefits when countries that are so close together can communicate using a common language. As such the opportunity cost is well justified. Maori doesnt provide such a benefit.,newzealand,dd9bqc2,4,t5_2qhma

What you described could work here because we get absolutely no snow. The tiles are decorative and protect the roofing felt from UV deterioration.

Shows the duplicity. The implication is shes saying that the difference in treatment of Maori  of pop is more important then the difference of treatment of men  of pop.

Is that so? I see otherwise. I see calls for special laws to made to target criticism abuse etc which arent normally considered in other scenarios. I see virtue signalling and dangerous precedents being pushed for. I see mentally ill women being buried up to their neck in shame and having stones thrown at them by higher society. I saw no proof for it but the offender even claimed that her own mother is a Muslim. Shes mentally unwell. gtThe bigots who target them are. To have a target you need to aim. I dont think the woman in question had any particular plan to be offensive that day  she just was. As despicable as it is to throw cans at people and call them names its not the crime or of the century nor does it require special laws to address it.Have you ever been the victim of abuse or assault? Did you go to the media or YouTube to solve the problem? Did your case get written about did politicians discuss harsh new laws to combat the problem which was admittedly rare?

They dont invest in the future or take a punt on a technology that will work here in NZ  they follow whats done and established overseas and then do the entire process to implement here in NZ. Needless to say it doesnt often fit.Often they go for a midrange solution that fits their existing infrastructure not trying to create the best experience for the customer. The customer is just not in the forefront of these thoughts. Thats why they will never and can never create something of quality like the Netflix experience.Some of it is money grubbing. iSKY used to require multiroom to watch sport because its another TV set essentially another decoder. To be clear not all the problems with Sky Go or iSky are Skys fault. They went through at least  CDN providers during iSKY days. The providers are just weak as here in NZ but also Sky didnt plan for the peak usage. When your traffic goes up x they crumbled. And few providers here in NZ can support that level of traffic. But its this level they need to be playing at and should have thought ahead of time where the interest will be and on what days.,newzealand,de39nch,1,t5_2qhma

Hence why rehab centers actually work by removing the person from the stimulus entirelySo by rationale if its too hard to police it well just legalize it... So are we looking at legalizing drink driving now?We have a meth problem because it was so lucrative to be in it and thus now weve got addicts all over the place enticing others into it to fuel their addiction by getting more to go halvsies and all that in what they are buying... The big old Ill pay this round you pay next time is a major factor.Im not for death squads I never said I was... Giving the justice system more teeth rather than slapping these kids with wet bus tickets isnt that difficult.So do you mean that having the gangs cleaning up their own streets isnt having an effect? Be it that its vigalantism and that its bound to have someone hurt again its a lesser evil in some terms.Clear out the peddlers and make it harder for them to function and the streets will clean themselves up.Its not that hard to understand that our justice system and the police have actually failed us either through not being effective through choice or funding...If the police were on to it  years ago when they were advised that this was headed our way we may have avoided it but now to have so many addicts that people simply want to give up and submit to legalizing it is plain retarded.,newzealand,de89j2l,1,t5_2qhma

Being chemical free does not impinge upon the moral or legal rights of others. There is no moral reason I cant be discriminating when I choose what substances I expose myself to nor moral duty to explain why I do so.If I am only allergic to specific household chemicals then avoiding all household chemicals is an effective strategy in order to avoid an allergic reaction.  On the other hand if I never suffer from an allergic reaction when I have been driving my car then I have no reason to avoid the chemicals present there.  Avoiding all dishwashing liquid because some products contain chemicals that exacerbate my eczema doesnt mean that I am committed to rejecting chemotherapy if I get cancer.  Simple and logical. Nothing wrongheaded there.gt ... there is nothing special about synthetic substances ...Many synthetic compounds dont exist in nature.  That makes them special.

Radio New Zealand is therefore my favourite and I think it is relatively unbiased but it could perhaps be argued to swing ever so slightly to the left but then sometimes its hard to tell if it just seems that way because all of our other major sources tend to swing right.  All in all read a few but dont miss RNZ because they do tend to run stories that the others are reluctant to run particularly if they are negative towards the government.  ,newzealand,deevqbq,10,t5_2qhma

Is it fair to ask young people entering the workforce today to bear the brunt of a housing market tipped  by policy  in favour of the older generation and the brunt of tax policies also tipped in favour of the older generations with the burden of high education costs and lesser superannuation borne only by the young?No I dont believe it is. Not at all. I am fine with the superannuation being changed and indeed we need a better approach to changing it than Bills halfarsed election distraction. But along with that we need a rebalancing of tax and property law to give young people a chance in NZ. Auckland should not be a Vancouver of the South Pacific a lottery ticket for those born at the right time driven by the demand of foreign and domestic investors witness the slowdown since China clamped down on capital outflows at the expense of future generations of Kiwis. Remove tax advantages for investment property put a  stamp duty on foreign purchases consider tweaking the volume  mix of immigration to let supply catch up a little. Then well have policy made for all New Zealanders not just for the older generations. If calling the boomers out for their selfish policies boomer govt for boomer voting bloc is part of whats necessary to achieve real change then I can totally understand it.And in terms of avoiding intergenerational warfare Bill English should lay off labeling young Kiwis as drugaddled layabouts who should be abandoned in favour of an imported replacement workforce. ,newzealand,deot1uz,24,t5_2qhma

11169353,0,t3_5zgx8g,The Moriori were a tribe of Maori who left the mainland to live on Chatham Islands where they developed a culture of nonviolence. After NZ was colonised a tribe of mainland Maori chartered a European sailing vessel to take a war party to the Chatham Islands where they had little trouble slaughtering and enslaving the pacifist Moriori. Theres some cultural context to this that might apply to the shirt it was once mistakenly believed that the Moriori were not an offshoot of Maori but another distinct Polynesian migration that arrived before Maori. Thanks largely to mistakes published in a widely used primary school resource this misconception still hangs around today.Often when discussing matters relating to reparations and compensation paid to Maori for injustices of the colonisation of NZ the incorrect comparison is made to the Maori invasion of the Moriori  because Maori took land from Moriori by violent means and never paid compensation why should European settlers be expected to pay reparation to land that they took from Maori is an argument often made  which misunderstands both the relationship between Maori and Moriori and the relationship between Maori and European settlers.I might be reading too much into this but Moriori lives matter might be a slogan popular with people opposed to treaty settlements or who just want to remind Maori of a particularly brutal and one sided episode of intertribe warfare to shame Maori.,newzealand,dey18yd,39,t5_2qhma

11235961,1,t1_df5flgd,The antichoice people either hate women and do not believe in their right to bodily autonomy this is pretty puerile and you usually arent. You can not believe that the right to bodily autonomy trumps a childs right to life and also not hate women. A lot of women are prolife and all of the people I know who are prolife dont hate women.There arent really any equivalent scenarios in reality that compare to a woman pregnant with a child. Abortion requires action to kill the unborn child which violates the right to not be killed e.g. No one shall be deprived of life except on such grounds as are established by law and are consistent with the principles of fundamental justice.. No other situation gives the right to kill an innocent so why should a woman be granted that right? In fact there is a legal requirement not to abandon or expose a child under  years of age which interferes with the right to bodily autonomy in lieu of the right to life of the child. This is probably the closest analogous situation to a pregnant woman not being allowed to exercise her right to bodily autonomy over the right of the child to life. If you could abort a baby without actually killing the baby then that would be much more reasonable and you can induced labour is essentially a procedure to end a pregnancy at a nonnatural moment which prolifers arent typically against but in reality you have to violently destroy the babys life in order to cease the pregnancy in all of the abortive methods I know of. ,newzealand,df5kwtm,0,t5_2qhma

11327020,0,t3_61hy8e,Last month I was at the Mission Bay beach and a couple of American girls were topless sitting on the grass under a tree chatting away with their group. Two pacific island ladies in their s or older walked up to them and started threatening to smash them if they didnt cover up. What must have been one of the girls father stood up and asked what the problem was and he was immediately confronted by one of the island ladies husbands threatening to kill him for disrespecting my family with around a dozen young island guys in their early s rushing over shouting obscenities at the group while the island ladies screamed cliches about the children. The group clearly feeling threatened moved down onto the beach and were followed by a horde of angry people threatening violence. Cops showed up advised the group to cover up and leave with just a warning and arrested the island husband for threats to kill.        I saw a few girls just sitting topless minding their own business not flaunting anything or being provocative and they were literally  feet away from the sand. The response was absolutely disgusting and left me feeling pretty annoyed knowing that the exposure of female nipples on a beach apparently warrants torrential verbal abuse continued harassment after they moved away and threats of violence and even death.        The difference between nudity and indecent exposure is blurred and subjective. Some people consider the mere showing of tits to be indecent exposure. Its fucked really. It can be so easily swayed by who yells the loudest about being offended but luckily in the case above the cops showed up to stop anything serious happening that island husband was so close to attacking the American father the father was in a completely nonconfrontational stance nor speaking in an angry or aggressive manner,newzealand,dffwdd2,2,t5_2qhma

Not being vaccinated isnt putting people at risk its simply creating the conditions in which you can get sick which could impact other people. Just look at alcohol its damaging to yourself and has massive potential for harming others but because it doesnt directly impact others its not banned.

11603594,0,t3_65iag2,My problem with universities solely being about money either the costs of it now or the student earning potential is that it encourages the middleground. If we want to move forward as a country as a society as people we need thinkers. Will all due respect to what are undoubtedly some fine minds a BCom is not about thinking it is at best an applied subject it is about execution. I say this as a software engineer with a Masters  my degree is in an applied field too  a great deal of my courses were about how to apply fundamentals maths physics algorithms and less about understanding those fundamentals in depth.Without thinkers we dont consider the mistakes of the past and when and how to make different choices. Without thinkers we dont examine what seemed impossible and eke towards that goal of making it possible. Without thinkers we dont question the status quo and that is dangerous because it allows power to consolidate and become abused. The original university disciplines the original arts of two hundred plus years ago were about thinking. They were about research that moved forward human knowledge in a manner that could then be applied. As a society we probably dont need a huge number of these thinkers. Perhaps the ratio of needed thinkers to doers has not changed significantly in onehundred years. The difference in those hundred years is that university used to be primarily about thinking and less about application doing  for which one had applied courses like those at a polytech. Now university is primarily where capable people go for an advanced education and that is fine but its important that we understand the distinction and spectrum between thinking and doing philosophy and application and make sure were not trying to apply one model of education and funding for all of it.Tangentially we also need artists. A society without people who can encourage us to think experience and feel is a dull society indeed. And from a purely national business perspective doesnt provide us with a legacy that may draw people towards us in the future i.e. think tourists going to Europe for the history and culture. This is best summed up by perhaps my favorite movie quote. It is from Mr Hollands Opus gt Well I guess you can cut the arts as much as you want Gene.

There were lots of us. You might not have noticed though because we didnt tend to make much noise.There were also a bunch of people who treated the place like a gigantic party zone and didnt even seem to notice that people were treating it like the workspace it actually is. They were too busy socialising and fucking about. I quite liked that for many of these people that was a respite from their work. Thats why there is space for that. I wasnt at UC but inappropriate behavior from contractors was a persistent problem. This included sexual harassment. Its still an issue with construction on campuses all the time. There are reasons for this. Its a predictable phenomenon and universities need to manage for it.Classism plays its part. Students are often snobs. I hate the class segregation that happens in universities between general staff especially cleaners but also security hospital and junior admin and students.

Theres a really good study and article on that exact topic hereIt can also reproduce alone through parthenogenesis so it aint no thing to it if it kills all the males.The study that found it was eating the New Zealand mantis found that  M. caffra females ate about  of M. caffra males who approached them but ate almost  of approaching kiwi mantis males Orthodera novaezeelandiae. It also noted they may eat a lot more in the wildTo make matters worse the kiwi mantis male finds M caffra more attractive than it finds the kiwi mantis females who dont eat blokes at all.
