9582925,0,t1_d9u7l0f,I suppose we would need a moderator to do that and if a mod actually appears a sticky post would work much better.And speaking of which the sidebar has a lot to catch up with the game especially the friendadding method.,MLPIOS,d9uahin,2,t5_2vik0
9596612,0,t1_d9vofc2,Once you completed the last  you had available the quest would autocomplete the rest because there are no more available. It doesnt adjust the original quest because you only have  spaces left but will recognize once its impossible to finish the remaining  because youve cleared them all in this example. Just be prepared to clear them ALL or when you need to do  for a quest and youre at the point where theyre really expensive it can be pretty painful!!,MLPIOS,d9vz8hk,2,t5_2vik0
9650889,0,t3_5d8evu, GEMS for the  of games ponies GEMS for the  of games shops infinite GEMS for ponies costumes GEMS for the Raras ponies because the special works gives  item every  attempts without GEMS youll get them in  years The  lotteries with poniesshop rewards YAY lets introduce kids to GAMBLING! costs  for  game ballons   and  GEMS. And they gives what you want after  attempts... so Flurry Heart as an example could cost you  GEMS or even more! Hacks dont work anymoreAnd the game gives you  GEMS at a day if youre lucky!So you should purchase a ridiculous amount of gems for real money.Example  purchasable ponies of the Crystal Empire costs total  GEMS which means spending  Im Italian dont know  prices.So take this heartful advice Dont waste your time and precious money in this thief game developed by greedy thieves! If you want to spend money spend them on games that really worth like PCconsoles. Maybe maybe? SURELY youll even spend less the money you would waste in that buggy shitty game.And if you want a game with an honest level of challenge playable without spending your whole bank account try Disney Emoji Blitz its an awesome game!P.S.

Since I did manage to get the  gem reward Im  gems ahead by the end of the event. But yeah it wasnt my idea of fun.What I fear is that events like this will become more common in future.
