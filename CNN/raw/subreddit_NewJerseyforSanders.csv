3848236,0,t1_cqux92p,It doesnt for me Im obviously still voting Bernie and I stand for a lot of what he stands for. The point I was making was that Bernie demographically does not fit the normal archetype for a revolutionary. The media is not going to help and its a point that is going to stick with Americans. So its on us the Bernie supporters to be able to spread that word of a man that wants to change the way America does business.We need to know his weaknesses superficial or otherwise so that we can be ready for it.  ,NewJerseyforSanders,cquxlhd,2,t5_3818f

7180351,0,t3_4dst6y,I know a ton of young people who support Bernie around here its almost been unanimous. Now the polls they do over landline dont actually reach out to them but when I go to Bernie events I see people here from all demographics. I am confident that our state is receptive to Bernies message and we will do a great job as the campaign moves forward ,NewJerseyforSanders,d1ucbpm,10,t5_3818f

7502165,0,t1_d2upfdm,You could use the Weekend  or Weekend  campus bus routes to get there for free. You dont have to be a student to use them.They both have stops near the train station but Id recommend walking from the train station to the Student Activities Center on George Street and hopping on the Weekend  bus there. That bus will go straight to Livingston from that stop. And the place you would get off is actually the next stop Livingston Plaza. If you get on the bus at the train station stop it will take you around CookDouglass or Busch Campus first before getting to Livingston.Heres the Weekend  bus route mapped out and another way to look over the route And heres the schedule,NewJerseyforSanders,d2uygla,2,t5_3818f
