I understand using  swear words in one sentence but I saw a few times Duke and other people getting told ON STEAM to stop swearing which resulted in awkward situations which I think did more harm than it helped.Also saying Fuck or other common swear words when you fuck up adds to the atmosphere and tells us how much the runner is in to his game. What is your opinion about that?Also I knew nothing of DarkSpinesSonic did you ever get to talk to him? I was REALLY impressed by his Sonic run and how much he seemed to have prepared for AGDQ he talked throughout his entire run making it easy for a person like me to understand a Sonic game and what he was doing even though I had never played one.Also Goose the Goldeneye speedrunner been waching his streams a lot and when I saw him on the AGDQ list I knew it was going to be good on stream he seems like a REALLY REALLY nice guy that is into his own runs and into his friends runs always talking and giving hype  How was he?Also was Professor NES at the event?,speedrun,ceq1om7,7,t5_2sf9e

787244,0,t3_235wqk,I check this place once a week or so but the low amount of contentsignaltonoise ratio leave me going elsewhere the majority of the time. The constant stream of people new to speedrunning is great but I dont want to see a quarter of the posts be asking for advice on how to stream or what game to run or what capture card to buy etc. A general getting started sticky with mods killing other posts and directing to said thread would go a long way to helping that imo.  Speaking of mods I honestly dont know who they are and a cursory check of their twittertwitchSRL race history lead me to believe theyre not very active in the community. This is coming from my very heavily SRLbased perspective so maybe theyre more active in the SDA community or elsewhere but it seems like a problem.  Honestly my opinion of this subreddit is that its an ok place to get general info of whats going on but I would never come here asking for technical or indepth information about speedrunning or a specific game  Ive seen plenty of misinformation that I know is wrong but dont have the timeproper info to correct  and maybe thats ok.

801770,0,t3_23b344, Ive recently within a year stepped down from being an admin across  servers for a fairly large gaming clan easily k members spanning numerous different genres of games. As for reddit moderation none. Im a moderator in a few channels most of which games I have a heavy interest in. Misinformation and trolling are probably this subreddits biggest issues right now. Im not sure what the stance on most things are but some of the crap Ive seen posted on here would be removed instantaneously on numerous other subredditsforumsboards. And Im not just talking about people calling each other racistsexist things or whatever Im also including the constant discouragement of people improving their times the blatant disregard for the very few rules we have here and TONS of misinformation thrown out with no check whatsoever. I know things arent perfectly clear in some cases Ive even talked with the mods before about certain things but something has to change or were just going to keep getting more and more nonsense shoved our way. I dont speedrun anything these days due to not really being able to stream terrible internet. What I do manage to put into the games Im invested in are routing theorycrafting and suggesting improvements players can make. Ive written FAQs guides and analytical pieces on various things as well. I have no intention of running anything until I have a more stable internet connection either. SuggestionsChange the rules up and enforce them more adequately and rapidly. Do NOT be afraid to warnremove comments that arent constructive and only serve to cause derailment. Post a sticky embodying numerous things people wish to see such as how to start speedrunning what is wsplit where can i find OBS etc... There is no harm in having a compilation of very useful data at the top of this board. This has been asked for CONSTANTLY why isnt it in place yet?Create weekly threads for people to post accomplishments in.If theres a new game out and times are flooding in compile them into a single thread this is done in most major subreddits Im sure they can explain how to make it work for us.Clean up the sidebar once we have the sticky mentioned above so that it only includes the rules for posting a few links and what rspeedrun is about.Im sure theres more and I know this wasnt asked for but visibility is whats really going on here.

1016260,0,t3_25qdnh,Hey there. This is the perfect time to start speedrunning Halo. Its really kicked off since AGDQ. As youreyouryore said check out haloruns.com its the best site out there for halo speedrunning. One of the best things you can do is go to the runners list sort it by the game that you want to learn and follow some of the runners who run that game on Twitch. Then you can learn first hand and even ask them for tips directly. Most runners would be happy to help. After that its all about practice. Keep with it dont get frustrated and youll see results soon. For recording gameplay on a console youre gonna need a capture card. You can get a really cheap one they arent bad or you can get one of the higher end ones that run for upwards of . You get what you pay for but its also depends on how much you want out of it as well. Thats more of a decision for you to make than for me to recommend so Ill leave that at that. Hope to see you around the streams and the website.,speedrun,chjt0p5,6,t5_2sf9e

1443404,0,t1_cix50jj,That example was really extreme. I will make my own to make my point more clear I am  minute ahead of PB and at the last stretch before the final boss. I am gonna go from point A to point B. Between A and B I have a  chance of making it over without dying. I lose  seconds from saving. If I die I will have to go all the way back and redo the entire segment which takes more than  minutes. Do I take the risk of not saving and therefore not waste  seconds or do I save and lose  seconds on my PB to be safe? Since its a speedrun most experienced players will decide to not save to not waste time for something that is possible to do. A lot of players dislike having deaths in their PBs knowing that the time could be way faster without it so they will rather reset than get a PB that was just decent instead of really good. People have different ways of handling bad luck in games. Some accept it and some doesnt and reset. ,speedrun,cix7gfk,13,t5_2sf9e

1563891,0,t1_cjc0tuj,A lot of it can be found hereCamera Clipping was discovered when people were running up to a flower enemy near the volcano and the dog would get hitgrabbed by a different flower enemy a screen or two away. So theyd swap over instinctively then realize they should of just kept going and end up past the flower enemy they were running up to. Rock Clips and Menu Clips were derived from this more or less after some experimenting during some practice runs.Underflow Glitch Atlas Glitch at the time was discovered accidentally by Metasigma during an attempt where he was trying to use the old method of underflowing the attack stat and ended up dieing at what just happened to be the right moment. Invincibility was derived from the idea of debuffs being counted towards the total amount of things required for permaura an outdated and unused glitch from long ago. This was tested during a failed speedrun and turned out to work. Its basically a core glitch in the route now and ultimately reduces the difficulty of the run fairly significantly.Ingredient Flag Glitch was discovered when someone accidentally swapped characters while trying to pick something up which turned out to be a frame perfect trick after checking it out in detail for the TAS applications of it. This ultimately led to Character Event Transfers which is what Saturn Skip Removes all of Act  basically and Early Dog part of a trick called Blimp Skip are based off of. It was discovered during a run when we noticed that we could hit select to swap to a different character and end up having the event at that time a cutscene transferred to the other character. This discovery of this actually softlocked the game for the person doing the run after refinement and some more testing we have access to numerous different ways to really mess with the game a few of which are quite useful as mentioned above.,speedrun,cjcb1o8,3,t5_2sf9e

When you have both and are getting good at a video game you will know which controller does what and which you should use for certain games levels areas categories etc.gtControllers are your equipment exactly like your golf clubs tennis rackets baseball bats etc. From  yards out on the fairway you want to use a  iron while from a greenside bunker you want to use a sand wedge. Just like how you want to use an original N controller for most of SM but switch to a Hori for the Bowser throws.gtSorry if I came across a bit crass but you dont see someone going into a golf forum asking New to golf should I be using Woods or Irons?

2285572,0,t3_2le69t,I play Portal Inbounds and my time is pretty far from perfect. It is a pretty short run around  minutes average if you are pretty good. World record holder ublizik has a  his sum of best is a low  iirc. Means he is almost  seconds off his SoB.I am going to say that a segmented run using the current fastest RTA strats could bring the run down to a high  means he would be around  seconds off perfect using the current strats. In such a short run this is a lot imo. Compared to Portal Done Inbounds which is a segmented inbounds run using abyssmal strats he is  minutes and  seconds off which is a huge difference.Out of Bounds is like that as well. There is a new segmented run going on which will be somewhere in the  minute area not going to name the projected time but it will be under  minutes for sure. Compared to the current RTA WR by xcd which is  this is also a lot of timegain.Well this drifted off pretty quickly D My time is a  which is far from perfect  minute away from WR holder SoB lol.,speedrun,clu7ozn,2,t5_2sf9e

2733596,0,t1_cner0ry,Well technically the SNES is connected to the internet. Instead of being connected via ethernet cable it passes through the TASbot which sends it to the controller input in a format the SNES can read.Like if I were to tether internet from my phone to my computer or even a router to my computer while the device is actually the one connected to the internet it doesnt make my computer any less connected to the internet. My computer isnt able to read G data or wifi on its own so it uses the device to interpret the signal for it so it can receive andor send data. In the end its the same way that the SNES isnt able to understand internet data on its own so it uses the TASBot to interpret the signal.Sure it cant support most of the internet which in this case just the Twitch chat but if you were to connect an early s computer which has the capability to connect to the internet it wouldnt support much of it either.

2739781,0,t1_cnfhvre,Not quite true gt The reason for this change was because the Minecraft runners have unfortunately not found enough time for proper coop practice as they would have liked. Theyve only practiced for a single session since we spoke to them regarding the run almost two weeks ago. Even though the runners seemed to show promising progress during that session additional practice was required so that they were not in a constant state of derusting. With so little time left before AGDQ we were not comfortable with keeping the game on the schedule and hoping that they would find a significant amount of free time for coop practice during the holiday season.gt Vanquish was chosen as the replacement for a few reasons. The primary reason is that halfcoordinated has proven himself throughout the year at various marathons and is already very well practiced. In addition to his great performance at online events such as the JRTA Marathon he has demonstrated his capability of executing a very creative donation incentive where he keeps a soda bottle on hand the entire time sometimes using it to play. Furthermore the game is incredibly fastpaced and is fun to watch as a result. With less than three weeks before AGDQ it made sense to go with an established runner who has proven himself and can put on an entertaining show with very little notice.Also their estimate was over  times the current WR for the same category which was done solo and their best practice was  minutes over that. h,speedrun,cnfi2bg,7,t5_2sf9e

Skyward Sword is a good example where its completable in  minutes but the community has decided not to use the BiT glitch to copy items.

3033326,0,t3_2usz7c,Lee The game writes the value of the item youre about to get but as a negative number so if links distance from chest lt  write value as negative to ram address.When you rise from the water the game doesnt turn it into a positive value it uses it as a negative value. So the game reads what youre going to get before the actual table.Sometimes it is junk data that crashes thus why it doesnt work on some consoles. What comes before the table is dependent on the state of the game and platform.Getting a bottle is only possible on one version of the game because there just so happens to be data in the junk pile that corresponds to a bottle.,speedrun,cocei5u,3,t5_2sf9e

3087570,0,t3_2vi2ny,Cool I used to play the game a ton as well I never even considered it in a speedrun.  Do you plan on doing more runs of the same campaigns?  You mentioned wanting to do the rest of the campaigns but itd also be cool to see more optimization too for example you could probably get this run to sub . A few thoughts I had while watching your runYour strategy is overall fairly solid being able to essentially skip  of the campaign is really nice.  Quite a few of your decisions seem to be made quite slowly though theres quite a bit of time you can save by doing things such as faster overworld movement.  Being able to pinpoint where you want to go and click your hero to go there quickly can add up.  Its been awhile since Ive played the game but if I remember correctly there were also at least some hotkeys?  Things like E for end turn can save moving the mouse across the screen.  Halfway through the second scenario you started using autobattle a lot more which even though youll often waste magic and lose some units has a huge payoff in basically skipping most of the battle sequences.  So I would take advantage of using autobattle in most cases as long as you dont need to do anything technical to win the fight.Another thing particularly in the earlier parts your spell of choice was magic arrow.  Quite often especially when you have such low spell power spells such as bless can increase overall damage and finish the battles faster.  Just something to keep in mind direct damage isnt always the fastest. An idea for the nd scenario I dont think its actually as necessary to get all the mines as you think.  Once you get a few and lock down the enemy in  castle you can spam end turn for a few months and then use the marketplace to spread around resources to afford the guilds.  To me it seems like it might be faster than spending the time moving your spare heroes around doing battles and collecting things.  Really entertaining and I hope to see more D,speedrun,coi0whc,2,t5_2sf9e

Keyboard vs gamepad is somewhat subjective on an individual basis but to say that being able to use all the fingers instead of just one is a disadvantage seems a bit... questionable. For all the nessnesgame or something from that era I have played the keyboard either offers a noticeable advantage or is equivalent to the controller. Mashing can also be easier imo since its easier to keep the keyboard stable. My opinion is only based on my own experience so it will be pretty difficult to convince at least me that keyboard is a handicap...,speedrun,com1ftm,3,t5_2sf9e

4140137,0,t1_crs6nxc,I wont argue what others do and dont have fun with but THPS HD was an absolute abomination of a video game a completely bugridden cashgrab at best. It controls more like drunk dog shit than any THPS game who made their name on precision controls and tight gameplay. HD will just throw you off your board because fuck you but even in THPS you only bail because you make a mistake. HD was shitty in every possible way. The trick animations are garbage online was terrible or nonexistant for PC players the controls were crap the speed was unpredictable wallrides were a gamble whether youd bail or not all the levels had already been remade in  THPS games already Robomodos stance on THPS DLC reverts in other levels etc etc etc.Edit Now I feel like an asshole for shitting up Trebrns thread. Props to him on the run Im sure he worked hard on it. The only reason I bother bringing up my THPSHD QQ is because if theres ever been any chance at a passable THPS game since THAW now is the time.

4410364,0,t1_csmo6np,Assuming that both reach k viewers. The argument is irrelevant. Unless they choose to play a game with a high player count Dota LoL cs go hearthstoneAs long as you can beat out minecraft generally having k viewers you can still have the game on the second row of games.Additionally twitch highlights marathons and championships. So during peak championship hours you will have  slots of championships and  marathon and  wildcard. While during slow hours you will have both marathons being shown in featured.Additionally on the scale for individual channels. You are again competing with championships and top streamers. Top streamers generally have anywhere between k and k. This is from about cobalt streak to Lirrk. Again splitting the marathon would place it within that range and while spotlighted will be higher on the list.Honestly from a viewer count standpoint the chat will always be awful regardless of the decision. However just because  game is on stream A doesnt make game  worse on stream B.  If there is a bot constantly linking game title current time runner Link to stream as well as a link below the stream. It should generally be fine.Edit to explain the games page. If a game appears within the first  rows then someone who would click the game tab looking for something to watch would say hmm why is mario sunshine so far up the list. So as long as the game isnt normally above k viewers then the marathon will get random people to join and watch.,speedrun,csms6xt,2,t5_2sf9e

The controls are limited when compared with the official games with the A button being used to pick up barrels B to run and C to jump. As a result the rolling attack was omitted from this game which means that the enemies can only be killed by jumping on them or throwing barrels at them. Like most pirates this game doesnt include a save feature or a password system for that matter although it does have unlimited continues with a crudelooking continue screen with a sprite of Cranky Kong who doesnt appear anywhere else in the game.gtgtImage igtImage igtInteresting Super Donkey Kong  Donkey Kong  | Super Donkey Kong Donkey Kong | Donkey Kong Country  Kong Country  | Super Donkey Kong  Xiang Jiao Chuan Donkey Kong  Xiang Jiao Chuan Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwctlhw oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletectlhw.

4956147,0,t1_cuiqp3n,This is un true. The portion I highlighted are the requirements for a party to qualify for the content id program on youtube. This is the system Nintendo is abusing. You have also cited no legal cases where they have ruled against the content creator for gameplay commentary footage. It doesnt exist as far as i know. The legal precedent has been so far in favor of ruling this as fair use. At least you and i agree on many things.

5022279,0,t3_3jpkar,Just to give you a heads up.Fox and others are currently doing a new MM any TAS. I think the WIP of first cycle can be found here Now what they do is despite collecting all the necessary rupees to buy explosives later in the game they also go and hit the Milk Road owl statue because that allows them to soar to Snowhead ? later in the game which is faster for a TAS than doing the FFAE from Woodfall and then doing the normal lullaby skip as it saves explosives and time and a TAS can do that I suppose by HESSing.I didnt watch your whole video its kinda long so I skipped through it but I guess this is not really useful for the idea Fox and others have come up with.

Use this after youve unlocked the handful of tools you need Small Energy Packs  Small Energy Storage  Interstellar Drive  sell about  cities worth of buildings and youre at . mil which in turn pays for the tools and energy packs as well as Refuel costs. Turns out all of my segments from my current record outsped your segmented run. The only thing that couldve been faster in my run was maybe  seconds for Civilization and upwards of  minute in Creature Stage.

I sure hope there is plenty of support but it was  obvious that the committee didnt bother to talk to anybody in the community before they made that decision from what was stated in the SDA thread.Also just from a personal standpoint Final Fantasy  has aged especially poorly when compared to Final Fantasy . Its not a great closer and from what I remember got an incredibly lukewarm reception the last time it closed an AGDQ all the way back in .If they wanted a longer run I wish they would try something different that got a really great reception the last time the game and category was chosen which is Paper Mario All Cards.

5952230,0,t3_3wy406,I think this sort of thing has to do with the fact that there are relatively few games with big competitive communities. Mario  Mario Sunshine Ocarina of Time Majoras Mask Wind Waker and Yoshis Island come to mind. Most of those games have records being close to optimized after many years of people looking for sequence breaks and many players trying to beat one another. That and speed running is a very time consuming hobby Honestly I cant remember the last time I had  hours straight I could just play a game let alone several times a week like Puncayshun and ZFG and those guys do. and so lots of old runners with big fanbases have retired having graduated college or whatever.That said Ive still been plenty excited over a lot of runs. LackAttack finally got the first ever sub in The Legend of Zelda last week now that game is almost optimized. Puncayshun has been close to getting a new WR in Mario . ZFG seems to have an endless supply of Ocarina categories hes still running. Bounceyboy just got the first ever  in Mario Sunshine a few weeks ago. And there are new games like Windwaker HD and Shovel Knight that can be fun to watch as people try to find ways to optimize and find skips for. Plus there are games like Twilight Princess HD Zelda  YookaLaylee and A Hat in Time to look forward to next year which all look like great speedrunning games.Even if theres no the big event like with Siglemic back when he had  viewers on Twitch whenever he got to the rd floor in SM there are tons of games being played and the runners streaming them are definitely enthusiastic about them. Even if theres only like  people watching at any given time they can still be really exciting. Id recommend seeking out more gamescategories if youre getting bored.,speedrun,cxzv8mf,7,t5_2sf9e

One thing to note is that ucyberdemona never actually posted his run he got his friends to post it on reddit for him. I sent him this message to ask him to stop posting it claiming it as an any WR because it was not an accepted run at the time. gtbanning people for trying to organize speedrun marathons if he didnt agree with the cause they were supporting.What whitegoose is referring to is that he wanted us to add his Donald Trump marathon to the sidebar our conversation The main problem he forgot is he was permanently banned a year ago by uyoungjiddle for this comment. He created and used uTrueReligion to circumvent this ban. I then permanently banned him on all  reddit accounts he currently has.gtremoving threads about WRs or speedrun news that involved people who had been banned recently calling this ban evasion do you consider it ban evasion on rall when someone talks about Unidan?After what happened above he went and got a great new WR on a Goldeneye IL. After he did this he asked his viewers to post and upvote his twitch highlight on reddit because could not post it for himself. This is against site rules on vote manipulation and subreddit rules about ban evasion. I promptly removed all of these posts. Here is the twitch vod where he asks his viewers to submit and upvote even being kind enough to let them know they have to manually go to the subbreddit and find it without using external link because they would get banned for vote brigading.gtcensoring any form of discussion criticizing the Gamesdonequick series of marathons despite not having any vested interest or affiliation in these events.I absolutely did not do this any removal that criticizes GDQ has been done by Shasta feel free to try to prove otherwise.gtmany many other instances of poor moderation.

NES SNES GBC GBA PS and Gamecube are all systems that have pretty good emulators for them so games for those systems are more likely to allow it.

6456085,0,t1_czn3iad,Its a fun game but its just dreadfully slow from a gameplay perspective. HP drains slowly walking speed is slow you surf at walk speed rather than run speed the entire game just drags on and on and makes it a pain to play. Like a single turn in battle can take upwards of  seconds. I speedrun Black and there are entire Gym battles that last that long. Plus the fact that Platinum is all around just better and made tons of improvements in terms of story and mechanics.Thats not even including the fact that the glitchless Pearl speedrun is super RNG heavy even by Pokemon standards.,speedrun,czn3olc,24,t5_2sf9e

6504598,0,t1_czs38rv,Yep Ive seen the VOD will look through it a bit more detailed as I go. There are definitely a few spots where time can be gained during that run which is hopeful though he did get quite lucky with the bungie.Im running the SNES version as well but itll be the PAL version. For now Ive been playing it on the emulator as I dont have the cartridge yet but Ive been keeping my eye out for one. As the run on speedruns.com that is shown as WR is an emulated run as well I dont think there are too strict rules but I do eventually just want to run it on my SNES.The fact that the speedruns.com run is still shown as WR and the guy running it still has it as WR on his Twitch page did make me confused as to whether MechaRichters run is actually seen as the WR run.

6686849,0,t1_d08v2po,Hey it looks like my post was either disapproved or didnt go through. Good quality SD capture cards will record SD quality better than most HD capture cards. HD capture cards also give a preview delay which means that you have to delay your timer if you choose to use one. While using a converter with the HD card you already own seems easier you are actually upscaling your output and putting another component that will delay your preview even more. If you want to play off your monitor make sure you use the least amount of electronics as possible to lessen the delay.,speedrun,d0az8mz,1,t5_2sf9e

7098121,0,t3_4cnono,Well the main places where there are differences is in reducing slowdown or faster loading times. If the game you run has any areas where theres noticeable lag on the actual console try going through that on both console and emulator and comparing the time. If there isnt the only timing difference would likely be loading times. The best way to test this is usually to record yourself going into a loading zone repeatedly on both and seeing if one takes the lead after    etc. loads. For instance going in and out of a door that loads an area repeatedly.,speedrun,d1kxy4z,1,t5_2sf9e

7296411,0,t3_4fc4i9,Hi. Ive ordered from Katsukity back in November of . At that time it took just a couple days past a month for my DS to arrive. Katsukity while not the greatest when it comes to customer support or quality overall is reputable. At least reputable enough to know youll be seeing the DS again.  One thing thats very important to note right now is that Loopy and Merki the only two other people out there doing DS video capture mods have been out of business up until very recently for well over a year. This means that any person wanting a new capture mod HAD to go to Katsukity. It was either that or come up with their own mod and program to capture from.  Because of this I would wager that Katsukity is still backlogged on all the orders they have to process. Ive heard people mention their  month wait time before while others such as myself have seen the lower end of the spectrum.  Its been four months since your brother sent it out now? Id wager it should be returning soon at least within the next month. Again it all depends on how fast Katsukitys business can actually process through all their orders. He has plenty of reason to be upset at the way they handle their business but the information is also readily available through google searches and word of mouth.

As SmIzumi said during one of his runs and I have noticed several times you can do a strategy all you want but sometimes this game will just say no to you.Bosses can become invincible especially when nearly dead Ecto Ivan Ooze at the end especially. Ooze Men will just turn into puddles whenever they want even if they should clearly be hit. Ooze Men and Puddys can have variable health and spawns ect. Im just not good enough to figure out how to either stop some of this from happening or get around it.,speedrun,d3ieqqf,1,t5_2sf9e

8179950,0,t3_4rcszs,That has kind of annoyed me since the first GDQ I watched years ago. You basically take twitch chat which is inherently kind of memeyshitty and combine it with exposureAnd I used to think it was an unsolvable problem.Then Geek and Sundry started streaming and they have pretty large chats AND streams that are full of very attractive women and men some are real gamers and some are normal folk who arent great and their chat is generally a great place with a wonderful community.But I think the big problem is that any time GDQ tries to moderate anything or fix problems like reducing pagentry and controlling the couch to keep the focus on the runners rather than the loud laughing jackass with a giant stuffed animal they get accused of being scammers and lots of internet detectives decide to make shakey cases for why this is all a scam.Best suggestion is to just hide the chat.

8187362,0,t3_4rg3al,Just skimming  and checking the runners for what other games they doThe community isnt particularly large and a significant percentage of them are foreign nationals many of whom likely have english as a second language if that. So that is a very expensive trip out AND they may need at least a translator if not one of the native english speakers for the couch.And besides it isnt a traditional speedrun. Youll notice that the vast majority of games they show are d side scrollersmetroidvanias with other games restricted to special blocks often at nonpeak times or insanely popular games Halo. Part of that is the community and part of that is knowing what the audience will donate for.If you are interested I suggest actually going to the GDQ site and posting in their forums for a discussion or at least coming here when GDQ isnt on and the ACTUAL speedrunning community is around.,speedrun,d50yzkl,2,t5_2sf9e

There isnt really a too challenging place to start in speedrunning because many games are very much independent of each other so it wont really be easier to speedrun a more difficult game if youve already ran an easier one.

8256084,0,t1_d59hdie,Behemoth was behind for much of the race but he was up against some really great runners. Oatsandgoats was also on an absolutely ridiculous pace before he died to the rainbow beam. Behemoth has room for improvement but his time was amazing anyway and that category is hard as hell. The fact that he has such a consistent record of not dying in his runs is also pretty awesome its so easy to die in any as we saw. That was an amazing race. I really dont get the criticism.WRs also just arent that common in marathons especially for games like Super Metroid that have been run a ton. I dont get why people expect them at GDQs. They can take a ton of attempts. In a marathon you dont reset a bunch because you missed a trick or you had bad RNG on a part. You just go. And you do safer strats in a marathon than you normally might at home so that you get a consistent run rather than the fastest possible run since if you miss the fastest possible strats you may end you taking way more time than you estimate. This isnt true for all games some routes are very worked out and consistent.Pikmin is a weird speedrun anyway. It has a fair amount of RNG and the  and day routes can be very rough and inconsistent. Only one person has day single segment and only  have a day. day is more consistent but its not a guarantee.If people are going to bitch about Pikmin then there are other games that could have been done bettermore optimally. Next Im going to see some say that Irisjokers run of Trauma Center wasnt good because he didnt go for an all XS run despite only one person in the world ever doing a single segment speedrun of it.

8687536,0,t3_4yz964,Mirror on Twitch in case somebody prefers Twitch over Youtube  Part  Part  PartWR because this is the first time somebody has completed this game all achievements in a single setting and probably will be for a while. This was my second attempt doing this the first one I had to cancel after . hours due to some really bad RNG and no alternative backup strats at the Legend Spirit Sorcerer Fu fight which is basically the last optional boss fight before going to the Backyard at the endThis time I had a better strat for this fight. Execution in general was wonky at certain points which was to be expected though since this was my first or second in certain places time donig this in an actual timed run.There are  more or less big grinding parts in this run. The first one is to get all Immortals to Lvl  in Disc  grinding Silver Kelolons. This is done to make the boss fights throughout the storyline a lot quicker and since you need to grind at certain points anyways you might as well start early on.  You stop on Lvl  because  is the point where a single Silver Kelolon stops giving you a full level after each fight.Grinding  is at the Temple of Enlightenment. You grind all your Immortals to  Lvl.  in order to survive the final Backyard battle against The Immortal and you also grind the Mortals to Lvl  or  for Tolten so they acquire all their skills.  At the same time you also learn as many skills as possible with your Immortals be it via Skill Linking or Accesoire learning.Grinding  takes place at the Backyard once you are finished. The only purpose of this is getting all remaining skills on your Immortals to complete the achievement. This specific battle is chosen because it is the fastest way to grind SP.  Each battle gives you  SP and only takes roughly  seconds. As addition you get automatically healed after each battle and you dont need to waste time looking for random encounters.The only downside here is that you have to manually check who learned which skill since you dont get the summary screen after completing the battle.This is also obviously more a meme category than anything just because of the amount of time it takes to actually complete it. I doubt there will be others attempting this and I dont know if I want to do this again at some point either.If you have any questions feel free to ask and Ill try to answer all of them ,speedrun,d6rki7b,28,t5_2sf9e
8716457,0,t1_d6v53z1,Its not like its a total waste of time its all practice and experience as you say. But assuming a well practiced runner ready to take WRs in competitive games then if you want to get the WR as quickly as possible it is most prudent to go for a near perfect earlygame meaning lots of early resets.As I mentioned before inexperienced players on the other hand can benefit a lot from seeing runs through to the end even if they are a way off their PB.Growth of a stream is a different thing  Ive been considering this on a purely competitive level in terms of taking PBs and WRs but yes noreset runs are a good opportunity for stream growth.,speedrun,d6v727f,1,t5_2sf9e

8803879,0,t1_d762or2,Youve posted this on three different subreddits but nothing else so youre obviously a troll using a burner account. Whether its for laughs or if you just hate OatsNGoats with a fiery passion Ill bite.Im posting this to everything youve posted up until this point because you thrive off of attention and maybe this will satisfy your needs for long enough to pull your head out of your ass and think instead of spouting unjustified unreasonable bullshit and you will obviously claim that Im OatsNGoats because the easiest way for you to try to defend your stupidass argument is to claim that whoever is against you is the person youre making out to be the bad guy. If you really felt like OatsNGoats had a drug problem then any person with at least two working brain cells would think to tell the authorities instead of just putting on the internet in some random places. And if youre the vengeful idiot that youre making yourself out to be then youre going to do everything within your power to cause harm to those who oppose you even if its a complete waste of your time and resources that could be better used towards helping people like those speedrunners that are supposedly drug abusers but you arent going to even waste your time reading this because youre so selfabsorbed that youre completely unwilling to accept any line of reasoning that differs by a fraction from yours and that is why youre wrong. You fail to accept responsibility for your actions you dont ever bother to do whats right and youre just doing this to piss people off because you like it so Im doing the same to you. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead kiddo. Id recomend that you actually get off your sorry ass and do something with your life instead of acting like an idiot on the internet if that is an act. Yes Im droning on but thats only because for the message that youre trying to get across is droning on compared to how it could be. You could just say that you hate OatsNGoats and that you want to ruin his reputation but youre so stupendously inept that your brain wouldnt be able to process the thought of selfaccountability. People like you are why artificial intelligence will see humanity as beyond help and something that needs to end.Its quite a bold claim to say that anybody is abusing drugs. Can you point me in the direction of definitive evidence that hes doing any drugs at all?Perhaps a specific time on a specific video that shows him what you are claiming would be a start but you also claim that there are a few who are clearly abusing stimulants but you mentioned only one. You should follow up with mentioning others as well along with what evidence you have to support that.If you really think that this is an issue then you would need evidence that shows beyond reasonable doubt that theyre guilty of drug use.From what youre saying I just assume that you have no sense of humor and cant understand when people are being sarcastic. On top of that snorting and rubbing your nose are signs of a cold which isnt something that is too unlikely  especially when his friends could have been making a joke to fit the situation.tldr  dont troll amp innocent until proven guilty,speedrun,d763uy5,1,t5_2sf9e

The producers work to make these things give a positive light to the charity and a professional representation of what is being done. Because of the size of the event now it simply has to become more appropriate and refined because the publicity needs to be that way. When the event was smaller they could get away with a lot more. With more momentum building they need to do whatever it takes to make this event professional for the sake of all the eyes that are watching it. Bending rules is not really a choice because it basically says that its okay.

I have nothing against Final Fantasy X I spent  playing it when it dropped for the PS and then  when HD Remaster dropped for the PS.People cringe at the thought of hearing his laugh for  hours and honestly it isnt that bad. You want bad? Listen to the Japanese Tidus laugh and imagine listening to that instead. I wouldnt mind it since I have easily spent  hours either playing TFX listening to the OST or listening to Tidus MIDIs. I am actually looking for someone to the Japanese Tidus Dialogue with his laugh. A lot of the conversations are hilarious since his response to everything is laughing. Its an enjoyable experience for me from start to finish. From a creative standpoint the TFX OST was well done in my opinion.Oddly enough I get a decent crowd when I do my weekly run kind of hard to fit a  hour run in during the week since I work fulltime.,speedrun,d98evlq,1,t5_2sf9e

All other streamers are just as entertaining and clint just stumbled upon viewers.Nobody claimed he wasnt entertaining.  The original comment in this string claimed he was thisgt he is an interactive streamer with a semi regular schedule and he happens to like speedrunning.Which applies to every single active OOT  runner.None of this mentions entertainment and nobody claimed that other runners were as entertaining as Clint.  Youre arguing against a point that literally noone made.  Youre still the stupid one because apparently you never learned how to comprehend reading.  Typical braindead Clintstevens nuthugger.But even if they were making that claim the ad populum argument doesnt have any correlation to entertainment value.  Plenty more people listen to Justin Beiber and Miley Cyrus than nearly all of the greatest composers of the past  years.  All this means is that idiots outnumber smart people.Why anyone would watch a speedrunning stream for entertainment if they dont find speedruns entertaining is beyond me.  Why not listen to a comedy podcast?  Theyre way funnier and WAAAY more fucking interesting than Clint.  But I guess a comedy podcast cant give you attention in exchange for money like Clint does.  Clint is entertaining in that sense.  He has a great appeal for teenagers with no friends who just want someone to talk to which is a huge chunk of the twitch viewerbase as opposed to the much smaller demographic that actually have an interest in speedrunning.,speedrun,dbidiy3,2,t5_2sf9e

Runs like OoT are almost like anchors for the event as a whole.Mega Man is also a loved and highly nostalgic franchise.  And the runs are short as hell.  So why not include them?

10278357,0,t1_dc92ivh,It is always going to come back to the primary principle. Without doing something to add to the content or create something new it will be extremely difficult to claim fair use. It is identical to posting part of any broadcast to the internet that you dont have the rights to even if it is only partial. Film companies hardly consider their product to be movie clips and not entire movies so Im not sure why you bring in GDQ primarily relying on full runs and not parts of runs. The burden of proof to claim fair use is quite high and since there was nothing transformative in the content it would be extremely unlikely that he would win in this case. Posting on one medium Youtube and discussing hardly going to pass as discussion in a court of law on another Reddit arent the same thing. He could have easily linked to a clip from the Twitch broadcast rather than rehosting on his own Youtube if discussion was his goal so he must have either been attempting to monetize the video bring attentionfollowers to his own page or not thought through his actions very well.,speedrun,dc93w9n,1,t5_2sf9e

They will find an alternative within moments.    You know what banning an emote DOES do though? Piss of twitch chat. Pissing off a chat that is k people strong is generally a bad idea.    I mean the only reason I can think of for banning that emote is to reduce toxicity of the chat? But if you piss off twitch chat are you not actually causing a huge rise in toxicity?,speedrun,dcc008q,2,t5_2sf9e

11197761,0,t1_df15qzb,An amiibo isnt dlc. Dlc is additional content mostly. In botw amiibo are no better than cheat codes giving you free items. You dont do anything to earn them. But again this is all just my opinion so feel free to disagree. I watch speed runs for the innovative strategies and techniques runners develop to run the game as fast as possible. In what way do you think using an amiibo is impressive? The part where they place the figure on the controller? Or the part where they get in game items for literally no effort?But feel free to disagree with my opinion. Thats all it is. If you ask me if other games get a free pass for using dlc it really depends on the dlc. Its all case by case and in the case of botw its in my opinion not warranted. ,speedrun,df193v4,4,t5_2sf9e

11529474,0,t3_647dlv,Depending on the type of game an ingame timer that freezes during the pause screen can be very helpful as it increases the optimization ceiling for ILs significantly. Say you have a glitch in your game that can only be performed with two consecutive frameperfect inputs such as AA. The game will not take this on consecutive frames because it will interpret it as just holding the button so it would be ANoneA.This still isnt reasonable for anyone to perform with just a quick doublemash. If however you can pause buffer those inputs suddenly its reasonable. Most Sonic games use pausebuffering strats in this vein to optimise ILs as much as possible. I encourage you to look up the IL records for Sonics stages in Sonic Adventure DX and see for yourself just how extensive the use of pause buffering is,speedrun,dg2v93v,1,t5_2sf9e
