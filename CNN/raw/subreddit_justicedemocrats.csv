Most pistols do not come with the ability to run a suppressor from the factory but all that is needed is an aftermarket barrel that protrudes a bit from the front of the slide and is properly threaded.  Some do come with this feature but most do not. It is not hard to purchase one of these barrels the same companies that make the suppressors typically sell these barrels to use with their suppressors. ,justicedemocrats,dcy3ap9,2,t5_3iqju

If most white people vote a certain way I dont think to myself well white people know whats best for themselves theyre speaking on behalf of lived experience and they voted for Trump because they deeply know and understand. I still think you just promote and discount whatever you would anyway but add a false morality on top.gtIts the same way Id trust a Spanish native more on the culture of Spain than someone whos never been there. Give me a break. This is politics not a Yelp review. A political operative is a political operative is a political operative. Anyone you are listening to at any given political gettogether even a small one with a local organizer is already an ideologue on some level for something and has already made up their calcified mind. Thats why your post history shows you post in ShitLiberalsSay where they laugh from the far left and you are bought into antiantiSJW culture in general. Im sold on something youre sold on something the game was over before we met. My main point is pretty simple this was pitched to people as a civil justice space without social justice ideology so I dont understand why youre here. If  of women are Republican its not because they have some diametrically opposed lived experience of being a woman its because they are swimming in some kind of cultural ideology on both sides that instructs them to present their experience a certain way. I dont need some excuse to tell me person X has ideology person Y has lived experience. Its not that I think you are some terrible person for believing in social justice I just think the framework leads to irrational premises conclusions and arguments which I dont want to deal with it here.Given your post history I really dont understand why youre here.,justicedemocrats,dd74pl8,1,t5_3iqju

A hundred people watching him? Instead he got thousands to hear his message on Fox News next look at whats happened with Elizabeth Warren and how many people have heard her message that she was going to read.

He will arguably keep winning just because he has a D next to his name. However it is well known that he in general is very centrist and is very friendly with the Republicans in the State Legislature. He is just now recognizing that New York is going to become extremely progressive and antiTrump and will not tolerate much in the way of third way bullshit anymore. For example he blocked minimum wage legislation saying it would reduce jobs or it was unsustainable or we but eventually Fight for  made it so overwhelmingly popular that he had to flip and immediately passed it. He also has control of something called the Independent Democratic Caucus in the State Senate which caucuses with the Republicans. He uses them as political cover whenever he wants to block progressive legislation like the minimum wage because by caucusing with the Republicans it allows the GOP to set the agenda and never bring up these bills to a vote. However in  he got a primary challenge from Zephyr Teachout which scared him a bit. I think that if we get a more credible candidate for a primary we could actually force him to be more liberal in the future especially because he wants to brand himself as progressive for when he runs for President in  that ladder climbing shitbag,justicedemocrats,ddl0wph,2,t5_3iqju

They judge us based on the color of our skin not who we are or what we believe. gtI didnt say no one could generalize all people that look a certain way as Muslims in fact thats what youre doing implicitly. However what Im saying is that criticism of Islam or demonization of it isnt inherently racist because Islam is a religious ideology not a race. The people that generalize all Arabs as being Muslims are ignorant assholes.Well I am saying that Trump generalizes Muslim people as do his voters. I dont see them shooting white people or telling white people to get out of their country because those white people are Muslim. I see them saying it to Arabs and South Asians however. It is not shocking the antiMuslim hate crimes have risen drastically since his presidency as well as antisemitism. gtNo it isnt this is projection. You associate Islam with people that look like you so you assume everyone else must also.As I said you dont see white Muslims being attacked now do you? They attack people who look like us brown people because they see us as Muslims. Thats all there is to it. You cannot divorce the idea of race from this particular faith. People have an idea in their mind of what a terrorist looks likeand its not white. gtThey may have but I dont care about that.
