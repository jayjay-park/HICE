196504,0,t1_cf0sdrc,So it looks like it DID import the priv key from theuniversal wallet generator and correctly convert it to the same public key that the universal wallet generator provided. dont understand why I thought it didnt before.the first time I may have copy and pasted wrong.I also tested the kittehcoinpaperwallet official which wa sup the other day is now down and the wallet did first send to the public ket I generated then import the priv key and then display the correct public key of the priv key with the privkeys label that i used when i importe it.it also credited my wallet with the  kittehcoins that were in the priv key i  imported.could tell if I got credited for the coins in the one generated by the universal wallt generator.have to try that oncemore.,kittehcoin,cf0tnr5,0,t5_2zj8k

264137,0,t3_1x4wsm,Thats what everyone expected one thing I learned in crypto trading is its always unpredictable greed is your worst enemy patience is your friendI think we will settle at least over  soon. Right now there is a lot of attention in VTC which also got released with MEOW. Just give it some time and see where we go. This community is still new and has a long way to grow,kittehcoin,cf84ydj,3,t5_2zj8k
276572,0,t3_1x8us0,Tsk tsk.. This person really doesnt bring anything to reddit. Hes just a leecher who always starts tip wars for his personal gain and has never even tipped back. just look at all his recent posts.. Disgraceful.. Go mine some coins and help the communities instead of going to every subreddit and asking for coinage..Not being rude but everyone you know the deal. ,kittehcoin,cf9fgrd,4,t5_2zj8k
300700,0,t3_1xgt2d,its not a meow problem its a cryptsy !! Ive had similar things happen with a number of different coins. If your balance is incorrect open a support ticket with cryptsy and they should sort it out.,kittehcoin,cfbxm3t,1,t5_2zj8k

724555,0,t3_22eif3,We need more involvement on the community the developers are making a great effort but theyre not magicians!We need miners who dont drop the coins for BTC. We need some artists to create posters small gift cards. Also we need a tipbot for Twitter and a widget to accept donations or payments online. ,kittehcoin,cgmmvnr,7,t5_2zj8k
