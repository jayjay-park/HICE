6603782,0,t1_d02bnkl,I get the confusion. So you can add Google Voice without getting a personalized Google Voice Number. I have used GV for several years but added a unique Google Voice Number last week. I then removed the GV because I wanted to go back to using GV without the unique number but it appears that I cant revert back.,Googlevoice,d02dwep,1,t5_2r9bx
7453271,0,t3_4hdwl4,I had that happen recently when I was trying to help someone get a new number.  Just keep repeatedly submitting it over and over until it takes  you may have to do it  or  times in rapid succession but eventually it may be accepted.  It appears to be some kind of error in Googles database that affects certain numbers.,Googlevoice,d2pe1ic,1,t5_2r9bx
7607770,0,t1_d36wb4b,My understanding is that dialing out from the GV app itself or using clickcall are two different means to the same end. They both use your cell phone plans minutes. The phone number masking is all behind the scenes at least when it operates the way its supposed to. Your google number gets routed through the masked number to make the call but the people youre calling see your regular Google number on their caller ID. ,Googlevoice,d36ypkd,2,t5_2r9bx

8771677,0,t3_5083ks,You have to somehow originate the call with google voice. The most barebones solution is you use the voice webpage to initiate the call and it then calls your iphones. When you pick up it dials out the other way to your recipient.Its not just that they are seeing your personal caller id you are making calls without gv at all.,Googlevoice,d724iy7,1,t5_2r9bx
9429869,0,t3_59to34,Only of you have hangouts dialer installed and hangouts integration with Google voice. Works like a charm. ,Googlevoice,d9bats1,9,t5_2r9bx
10160739,0,t1_dbvoxff,Is it using the Hangouts app to make the call? You might need to disable a setting there. I use GV to make nonVOIP calls with no issue.,Googlevoice,dbvryfd,1,t5_2r9bx

10918612,0,t3_5vzncq,This is an interesting question. Im not qualified enough to know if there is a solution to this but my instincts say there probably isnt. When the app developer queries the phone about its phone number it gets the number from the SIM for obvious reasons. I think its incumbent on the developer to allow the user to change it in the apps UI before proceeding any further. Ultimately it would be very slick if Google had a way of hooking the Google Voice app deeper into the Android system to be able to intercept those API calls and return them with the Google Voice number instead.,Googlevoice,de66ew1,1,t5_2r9bx
11019229,0,t1_degu4m7,You can get data only SIMs but you have to have  voiceSMS plan first so I have that in one device and data only in another.  The data only sim is free pay for only data used. ,Googlevoice,degzz1i,1,t5_2r9bx

11470011,0,t3_63pnkr,If you unlink Hangouts to Google Voice and use the Google Voice web interface or app  the problem seems to not occur. However  theres people who have reported long texts not going through on the Google Voice app. Get it together  Google! ,Googlevoice,dfw4byl,3,t5_2r9bx

11671704,0,t3_66jphy,I dont think you fully understand Google Voice. You cant just have it billed to your Google account. GV is not a cell service and doesnt use towers it is a phone service that you can utilize to receivemake calls  ways. By using forwarding numbers to connecting your existing phone number either cell or landline to your GV number.. Make VOIP calls over WiFi using the Hangouts dialer.If you give up your cell phone plan your only option will be  using Hangouts. And so you will only be able to make calls either over Wifi or over a dataonly plan. There is no costperminute unless you make international calls check website for rates etc..p.s. No matter what option you choose in order to setup a GV account you need at least  forwarding phone setup to complete the process. It could be a landline as long as it is not associated with any other GV account.,Googlevoice,dgj052j,6,t5_2r9bx
