Try to cut your computer usage where ever possible. read a book or work on a hobby. dont just aimlessly browse the net when youre bored. for me I realized that stress and anxiety triggered my porn use. anxiety about life and even about my addiction would make me just want to get lost in porn. talk to a therapist about your anxiety and maybe even about your addiction. I got some antiaxiety meds and it helps me to control my impulses. I also meditate regularly so you shout look into that,no_fap_november,d9mbt6f,1,t5_2vgbj
