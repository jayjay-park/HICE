1501348,0,t3_2bdvyn,Awesome! Enjoy all the crying fussing and sleepless nights.Youll look back and wish for those days. It sounds crazy but a newborn crying is one of the sweetest annoying things ever.Edit if the crying gets to be too much put the baby in a car seat or bassinet in the bedroom close the door and walk outside to cool off. Its perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and sometimes you need a break. Just make sure the baby is safe and take a few minutes to calm yourself. Crying for five or ten minutes wont hurt the baby.

Its taught for men by men and features a facilitator and several veteran dads who have been through the program and bring their children and their experience back to share.It will teach you about changes to be expected in your life and your relationship with your wife.

After all how many of us hoped a brush wasnt strictly necessary when we first embarked on wetshaving? I know I did and I know how wrong that impulse was. He also may not have been aware of just how cheap Arko is. This is not common knowledge and I didnt learn that particular fact for over a year. He may have splurged on that razor and paid too much although a vintage Gillette is never a terrible choice. He may be a student which means his income is severely limited and he chose to prioritize albeit a bit poorly.Therere any number of reasons why he purchased the things that he did and very few of them are so far removed from the realm of reason as to justify casting aspersions.,Wet_Shavers,cjbjs0n,3,t5_32kax

Sounds like you inherited the sensitive skin and coarse hair genes.Im pretty lucky I can shave every day with little to no problem providing that A I dont use an aggressive razor for more than  days straight and B I dont irritate myself too badly one of the days. If I do that it kicks off a vicious cycle in which I cannot get a good shave only more and more irritation on consecutive shaves. If I take a day off though I have enough time to heal and usually get an awesome shave the next time. I also find that  day growths give that Oh God!

Slickness wise holy fuck my face was a ice rink no other way to put it Ive done a full wtg xtg atg rinsed and toweled off and my face still feels slick and smooth. Also gave me one of the easiest and closest shaves Ive had to date.

She is always always in a sink or the bathtub. Today while I was shaving she has one foot on the top of the faucet of the tub and was batting the water with the other one. She also loves computer screens. She often sits in front of our monitors watching us work. Every morning she sits next to brads laptop and watches him email. She is a boob cat too.

2233888,0,t1_clnr3hd,Youre correct. However the oakmoss that I use is atranol free and is thus not subject to the IFRA restriction. That said fougres were ALWAYS based on synthetic coumarin tonka bean absolute is so expensive and difficult to manufacture that it would not be commercially viable for it to be used in massmarket fragrance. There was never some industrial revolution that suddenly made the massproduction of fougres possible one of the reasons Fougre Royale is so historically important is that it was the first perfume to use a synthetic ingredient coumarin which touched off a complete revolution of the art. It was arguably the first modern perfume.Also coumarin is only toxic if you eat it and even then only in large amounts. It was used as a flavoring for years in the US and elsewhere. ,Wet_Shavers,clns4gs,2,t5_32kax
2236889,0,t1_clnx18z,Sure. Arancia di Capri About my only problem with Arancia di Capri is that like most citrus perfumes it has very limited longevity. However it pulls off the bitter orangebergamot thing very well and is a beautiful fresh green bright citrus that you can really wear any time but that is best during the Summer. Orange Star Andy Tauer is a Swiss biochemist and selftaught perfumer who has been making a big splash in the niche perfume world over the course of the last decade or so. His perfumes are known for incredible strength and tenacity and massive sillage and Orange Star is no exception. Its the only citrusheavy perfume Ive ever encountered where you can still smell the citrus more than  hours after youve applied it. Its really fascinating stuff but to my nose it has more vanilla in it than Fragrantica would have you believe which occasionally gives it a spicy creamsicle sort of vibe. If that sounds like its right up your alley I HIGHLY suggest ordering a sample.,Wet_Shavers,clo5uox,2,t5_32kax

It can cause dryness tightness and eventually irritation if left on too long. As far as aftershave recommendations my first choice would be Barrister amp Manns Kyovu Aftershaves Theyre my favorite AS in terms of performance and and postshave feel. You can purchase sample vials for  each. For other aftershaves Id recommend visiting Maggard Razors and browsing through the aftershave samples. There is a wide range of options available there. Consider checking out the Proraso aftershaves  particularly the White line. Geo F Trumper Skin Food and Castle Forbes are also nice options but can get pricey quick. ,Wet_Shavers,cluq46n,1,t5_32kax

2349469,0,t1_cm1z3nk,Thanks!  I was lucky to get it  they were only in stock for a short while then they hiked the prices.  Now theyre out of stock again.Have you looked at the Mongoose?  It takes the same blade as the Cobra but they are actually shipping new units.Anyway I also tried a showdown between a featherjector and the Cobra.  The featherjector is any Schick injector razor except you load it with a Feather Pro blade.  The blade needs to be trimmed to length.  It also needs to be carefully loaded into the injector cassette so it can inject the blade into the razor head without dragging the edge.  I found that the shave was very comparable and perhaps more nimble with the featherjector.  If youre curious vintage Shick injectors are quite easy to find on eBay.So yes I have found the width of the blades to be a bit unwieldy but I seem to have become accustomed to it by angling the blade.  No I havent tried any other blades in it yet.  Ive been lackadaisical about that because there are no blade samplers in this format.  To try a new blade you have to buy a new injector of  blades for  or so plus shipping.  Meanwhile each blade lasts  shaves.  So Ive barely put a dent in the original pack of blades that came with it.  I am curious to try the other Feather blades and the Kai ones also.,Wet_Shavers,cm23t0m,1,t5_32kax

2516976,0,t3_2ogdm0,Didnt feel like shaving at first since I shaved last night before I started drinking way too much but my ladyfriend is on her way over so I figured I should shower and might as well shave afterwards and get some sexy smelling vibes going.   Prep Shower used Mickey Lee La Fee Verte bath soap which is really great stuff.  I hate bar soaps normally and use shower gel but this stuff is really really really really really good Brush Plisson was there ever any doubt? Razor Muhle R Blade Shark Super Chrome last one from my first ever DE I used four of the five and had the last one sitting around for ages and decided I should just use it now that my technique is decent.  Second use. Lather ArkoDrunken Goat Post Alum witch hazel After Mickey Lee Cocoa Maya AS milkSo hopped out the shower and decided to test out my stick of Arko that I got from the Maggards on Cyber Monday.  Rubbed it all over my wet face then took my wet Plisson directly to my face and it lathered up quite nicely.  I like the shave stick format Ive decided.  As for the Arko itself it smells like cleaning products  doesnt bother me but it wont be a goto when I have such great smellz to choose from every day.  Also unfortunately I noted later on in the shave a bit of a burning sensation on my face much like I had with the Seifenglatt I used the other day  not bad per se and a refreshing change from menthol in this obnoxious weather but it felt like I had a bit of razorburn in a few spots that didnt according to the alum.After using the Arko for my WTG pass I decided I wanted some smellz and since I showered using LFV I decided to go to DG for the rest of the shave so that got me through my two XTG passes.  I ordered another thing of DG today because its so good.  Seriously so fucking good.Managed to take some skin off though  I have one spot of acne on my chin thats really irritating and the massive blade exposure on the R meant that the razor went right through it.  So most of my shave I was dripping blood into the sink.  redthursdays indeed.  Finished up with alum with only minor stinging and some witch hazel splashed on my face.  DFS for sure  didnt chase the BBS today and I wont be for awhile.  Used the Cocoa Maya AS milk  Ive said it elsewhere but the progression from La Fee Verte in the shower to Drunken Goat while shaving to Cocoa Maya afterwards is like a descent from brighter happier spicechocolatedessert scents into a darker richer gloomier cave of chocolate and its a journey that I very much enjoy.  The three scents go together so supremely well in this way and I dont know that theyd work together in any other way but like this its magnificent.umickeylee and usammylee once again great job.   supermodels on the soap for sure.

2724434,0,t3_2r7ued,I implement the same idea with different components. I use a Travel Tech its case is wonderfully compact and holds a few blades as well. The Omega Mixed Midget in its pill bottle its a tiny bit smaller than the Muhle in its handle but Ill give the Muhle the edge for its quickdrying synthetic knot.But I definitely use a shave stick  usually an Arko stub. That allows me to face lather so I dont need any kind of container. And so long as the weather isnt brutal Ill just shave with cold water thus eliminating the pot. And I include an alum block for both postshave and deodorant purposes. Gotta smell good for the bears...,Wet_Shavers,cndr99l,1,t5_32kax

4252728,0,t1_cs4z2je,I want to spend about  tops initially for everything but I can be swayed on spending more for a good reason. I havent done any research into the types of brushes so I cant say I have any preference yet. Im pretty patient but I dont know how bothersome it can be to break in a brush. Id probably prefer a wood handle but anything should be fine so long as it isnt metal or a cheap plastic. From what I understand probably bowl lather but I probably eventually want to try both so it doesnt matter.Soaps sound nice but again Ill eventually probably try both. Scents are kind of a hard thing. I dont like overly sweet scents but something that is a bit rich dark with mild sweet undertones its kind of what I go for. I have no idea about menthol. I generally have soft water as my water softener isnt terribly reliable.Thank you for the great questions!,Wet_Shavers,cs4zya1,1,t5_32kax

Instead Ive been ing my Kraken and after . weeks I havent really noticed a difference in the amount of soap still in the tub.. fuckin hell yall this shit will last me forever.  The whole tub of soap is smooth and theres a well but I feel like Im still about  from seeing the black bottom..The shave itself was fabulous the lather was thick and slick and cushiony.  Obviously I have a lot of practice lathering the Kraken so because of that its my most consistently good lather.  The Kai Stainless I dont remember who recommended these to me on the ircs but you a good man.  Ive kinda been slowly ditching my GSBs which were my previous favorite blade and in my Fatboy Ive found PolSilver SIs work much better but in the New they were quite harsh.  So I wanted to find something that performed like my PolSilver for my NEW and I may have found it with the Kai Stainless.  These are sharp and smooth and mow down my hair like nothing and leave my neck as close to BBS as Ive managed after two passes with no irritation and none of that zipper feel of some other blades gillette platinum Im looking at you.This is a lot of words to say my shave game is on fleek lately but renewed blade exploration has been working out well thanks to the folks in irc and tryablade.com.

The razor was definitely less aggressive but it wasnt mild either. Id place it at about the same level as a Gillette Slim on  or . Ended up with a mostly BBS shave with some irritation. Most of the irritation is probably residual from the OCMM shave though.The SOC is a new acquisition. Ill be breaking it in along with my  in true masochistic fashion. The SOC is quite scritchy right at the start. I had to bowl lather with it today to avoid roughing up my face too much which was weird. I enjoy face lathering infinitely more than using a bowl.Finished off with the Agua Lavanda which is also new. Its quite nice. I dont really like the opening but that only lasts a minute then the drydown kicks in which I do enjoy. Nice woodyherbal lavender scent. Should go well with my lavender soaps. Longevity is horrible for it to be called a cologne but I bought it intending to use it as an aftershave so Im OK with it.

The lather that I make for SR shaves is a bit less dense than the lather that I work up for my DE shaves.

When all else fails the Kraken is there. Its that workhorse I can always rely on for exceptional performance and a pleasant clean scent. I have very hard water but I didnt think it made enough of a difference to justify adding anything to my routine. I like to keep it simple. I recently bathed in the chill late summer waters of Lake Superior and when I was lathering up my hair with a bar of Dr. Bronners soap I was amazed to see that it somehow turned into shiny cushiony lather with just the friction of my own hair human hair knots the next big thing. So I decided to see what would happen if I treated my water with citric acid.The results were obviously superior. Ive always loaded for  seconds to make sure I have a ton of product on the brush thinking that would take care of any problem I had with hard water. But it turns out throwing more material at the problem isnt the best solution. Ive always gotten three passes out of my Fine synth but the second is thin and the third thinner. I wondered if it was just the fact that Im using a mm knot but suspected rightly that mm is enough to hold plenty of lather for three passes. With the addition of a pinch of citric acid powder to my water I got three voluminous passes with plenty left over. The quality of the lather was about the same it just held itself together better so that quality wasnt frontended for the first WTG pass.I think I might be a convert. I picked up plenty of powder from the coop I shop at for  . and Im going to find something elegant to put the powder in to fit it into my den like an L. Bandel ivory coke vial perhaps... In any case the citric acid takes up a fraction of space and improves the experience. Now I dont have to buy all those brushes Ive been eyeing up haha right.,Wet_Shavers,cv5uvp0,10,t5_32kax

I also switched to a London Broil instead of beef tenderloin because the latter was a bit too expensive for family dinner. The sauce called for dried ancho chiles which to my faint knowledge of all things chiles I took for pablano peppers. So I used a fresh pepper instead of dried it adds the perfect amount of flavor and a tiny bit of heat to complement the steak. The sauce ended up being outstanding on the egg noodles so Im going to make it as a standalone thing for when Im in the mood for some buttered noodles with a bit more  flavor.,Wet_Shavers,cvhcxi9,1,t5_32kax

5687842,0,t3_3t10zb,After over a month...LUCIDO CAME IN THE MAIL FROM JAPAN!!!! I was so eager to try the aftershave splash I just couldnt contain my excitement. I didnt know it came in a glass bottle and I thought it looked pretty neat how the bottle was frosted from being out in the cold. I also got a tub of Kraken.  First Impressions I couldnt wait. Had to try it The Lucido splash is stellar  currently sitting as my favourite AS splash in every category. Its very fairly priced I really like the scent its mentholated and the cooling sensation sticks around for a while and its got one thing going for it that really sets it apart from my clubman splashes even though theres alcohol in it it does not burn. Maybe the burning is masked by the menthol but either way I love it  I get all the benefits of a disinfectant without the harsh burn. As for the scent I would describe it as medicinal but not in a bad way. The skin conditioner however...meh. I thought it was an AS balm when I got it but Im thinking now maybe its just a regular face cream. It also has a cooling menthol sensation but its much more mild than the splash. I dont hate this stuff but I do dislike how it makes my face feel a little sticky afterwards. I wont be buying it again but I dont regret the purchase either. As for the Kraken....yeah Im not a fan. The scent isnt bad  its a nice scent  but I just dont find it to be interesting enough to want to keep. I love MLS performance which is what makes me feel like I should keep it but I just dont see myself using it a whole lot. Ill probably be taking it to SB or I might wait until the weather gets warmer and see if my opinions change by then.

5723680,0,t1_cx5fvj1,I used Tactical Support for the first time today.  It was my first French soap from Chris and Im not sure what is different from his regular formula.  A quick look at the label shows the only difference is jojoba in the as the last ingredienta bit of superfat maybe?  I cant say I noticed too much performance difference from my memory of my last shave with standard Caties.A quick note on my lathering method since it is probably different from most.  I spend  seconds starting to build lather on the puck with incorporations of additional water during that process.  The intent is to create a wellhydrated protolather that can then be worked in a bowl dont like face lathering with vigorous mostly vertical strokes to a dense cream and then slowly add more water that is incorporated with gentle circular strokes.  The goal is a dense shiny microfoam lather that flows easily.Caties has always produced that type of dense shiny lather for me. Where it loses points is in residual slickness and postshave feel.  The residual slickness knock probably isnt fair in the sense that there is definitely enough slickness during the shave.  I like to lather for the XTG pass and then immediately reverse direction for another XTG pass on my face without relathering.  The razor slid against my skin without sticking during that pass today so there really isnt anything to complain about.  Its just that in comparison other soaps leave my face feeling like an ice rink after the pass theyre good ones for shaving with straights. I cant comment too much on postshave feel of the soap because I used the Tactical Support aftershave immediately after finishing the shave.  It is a clear slightly shiny fluid that looks much like water.  It went on easily and was absorbed quickly.  My skin felt like it had been restored to a preshave stateit felt refreshed but not noticeably coated with anything.  In my mind this is a good thingthere is no trace of greasiness or any feel that the skin is getting clogged.  Since alcohol is a minor component there is also no alcohol burn or evaporation.  The ingredients list menthol but I barely noticed it.  It did fix the primary issue with CatiesI find it a drying soap.  Overall I liked the aftershave but I had a pretty good shave that didnt challenge its ability to soothe.Scentwise I can see this might not have broad appeal.  It is slightly floral with a good dose of gunpowdermaybe a nod to Flanders Field.  The soap and aftershave smell much the same with the aftershave being maybe cleanerslightly stronger.  In general scent strength is maybe  or  out of  and it fades pretty completely even from the aftershave in about  minutes.  I found it enjoyable and had a good shave and will definitely use this in the future. Plus proceeds went to a good cause seems a winwin.,Wet_Shavers,cx6kute,1,t5_32kax

I have my adjustable maxed out and am slowly moving up the blade aggressiveness ladder trying to get as much out of my two passes as I can.

6107528,0,t1_cyjmbh4,I havent tried the Falls Lumberjack but I know it was created as a response to the feedback that Kings Lumberjack was too light. Claude didnt want to add more pine to the soap due to a chance of irritation so he added some mint and menthol. For that reason I dont think you would be into the regular Kings Lumberjack. I was one of the people that gave feedback that it was too light and I wasnt that into it when I first got it. But I opened up to it and it grew on me a lot. I feel like the scent got a little bit stronger as a dug into the tub but I cant say for sure. Its still a very light pine scent that requires you to get your nose close to smell it fully and only sticks around for the shave and nothing more. Anymore pine in it would definitely irritate me too. Claude may release another version with additions to it its worth asking and giving feedback as the Falls Lumberjack was only created from customer feedback. ,Wet_Shavers,cyjv3id,1,t5_32kax

6155028,0,t3_3zuj08,To expand your area of search for opinions on that razor you should probably understand that the razor itself is a rebrand of a Weishi. Weishis are usable razors but they are absolutely bottom of the barrel stuff made to be the absolute cheapest way to create a usable twisttoopen razor. Their durability is the primary problem and their fit and finish is the secondary. Notice that neither of those two problems is how they shave. They shave fairly well as long as they are in likenew shape.Now on to the brush and soap. Waste of money. I dont know which ones you have but their cheap soap is just glycerine melt and pour stuff that you have to work fairly hard to get usable lather from. The luxury soap is anything but though it is better than the glycerine stuff. Dont be fooled to think it is decent for the money it isnt. Arko is decent for the money.Brushes again have two options bad and worse. Their badger brush is clipped black badger which is scratchy and not very dense. Their boar brush is also clipped which means it doesnt break in like quality boar brushes do and every single one Ive come across has been a shedder.,Wet_Shavers,cyp9g7s,1,t5_32kax

6406326,0,t3_43c5f4, Perhaps I should have inquired why folks prefer the Fatboy over the others OR why other razors over the Fatboy. Also I should have asked the top  things folks look for in razor. I will analyze the responses chart the data and post it so that folks see what their fellow DE wet shavers deem important.My top  traits that were important when looking for a razor were A clean BBS shave performance comes first. The razor must use ordinary DE blades  custom blades can make shaving daily outrageously expensive I LOVE blade adjustability  I use different settings for my face and head. This is the main reason I have       stayed away from pc razors. I LOVE the TTO feature  couple turns and one can clean the razor without taking out the blade. The Gillette Toggle excels mightily on this performance trait.  I appreciate clever engineering and design outstanding build quality and form is important  skinny or short chunky handles just dont do it for me.What do you look for?The Easy One of the biggest things I would like is easier cleaning and disassemblyassembly ideally without tools I like the bulk amp heft of the Futur and the length of the slim.   I have nicked myself couple times with the portion of the blade exposed after the blade doors are closed. I like the fact the Futur or the pc razor completely cover the blade except the DE edges of course Improve on the head geometry for even better shaving right under the nostrils and by the ears when shaving bald I have noticed that the two sides dont shave the same. Since todays manufacturing processes can hold reasonably tighter tolerances and  throw in design for manufacture we can get the left and right sides of the blade bed plate adjuster plate and blade doors to closely mirror each other.  When I go couple days without a shave the head clogs more and I have to TTO several times to run water through. This is not the case with the Futur.  Perhaps incorporating excellence from different razors into a Fatboy like vehicle is something worth considering. The trick is figuring out which vital few  features to incorporate into the new design. Which razors do you adore and love using?The hard I love visiting my local barber for a straight razor beard and head shave. I have always wondered about incorporating an adjustable slant into the Fatboy to mimic the clean slanting stroke of an expert barber using straight a razor. I have always wondered about flipping the head especially when shaving instead of having to handle the blade. This might be an easier way for me to utilize the  numbering on the razor blade. I have never tried to even bother keeping track of which blade edge hasnt been used yet. I Know Im being too idealistic here! Sorry! Built in mass customization such as variable handle length amp width weight etcLet me know what you think. Thanks.,Wet_Shavers,czhu1mw,2,t5_32kax

6555577,0,t3_45eunl,As far as getting a a safe shave the key is to use a safety razor. You gotta figure they got that name somehow right?As far as the shave being quick wet shaving is the wrong way to go at least at first. Things will speed up once youve figured out how to make good lather and developed the muscle memory for getting your blade angle right but in the meantime you should count on  minutes for a shave.The good news is that a nice lather and a good razor may change your mind about shaving in general. I know Im not alone in saying that it went from being an unpleasant chore to being something I look forward to every day. And even if you only shave once or twice a week it will be a more enjoyable experience.The conventional wisdom is that shaving long growth is easier with an opencomb razor. That has not been my experience. I find that a safetybar razor shaves long hairs just fine. Yeah its possible for the razor to clog but an open comb doesnt magically prevent that Ive clogged my opencomb GEM MicroMatic more than any other razor.Once youve got your razor youll need to learn how to use it. Its fairly intuitive but its also easy to make mistakes that will cause irritation and maybe even weepers. The key is to use no pressure and let the blade do the cutting. If its not doing its job adjust your angle rather than pressing harder. Watch a few videos  Michael Freedberg and Mantics YouTube channels are a good place to start. Be patient pay attention to what youre doing and understand that theres a learning curve in no time youll be getting effortlessly close and comfortable shaves.So I second the suggestion for the Maggard basic starter kit. Its the best value going. Another good option is the Standard razor  it has a fairly large blade gap so its not prone to clogging but the blade exposure is fairly minimal so its very comfortable. If youre in the US you can get it as part of the Bespoke Post Barber box Sign up for the subscription service you can cancel immediately and find the latest coupon code to get the price down around . Pick up a brush the Plissonstyle synthetics from Maggard Razors and Italian Barber are probably your most economical options Fine Accoutrements Chiseled Face Groomatorium and Stirling Soaps among others also sell brushes made with the same fibers.Edited to add penultimate paragraph.,Wet_Shavers,czxeewg,6,t5_32kax

I was in a bit of a bad mood and my face paid for it. Anyway my mother got a pack of Yardley Red Rose bath soap for her birthday last year. I used a bar last night and was blown away by it. It was stupidly easy to lather. The normal soap I use is Lux or Lifebuoy both of which are Indian made. It takes a lot of effort to get a decent lather out of them. And the scents are horrible. A tiny whiff out of a bar of Lux would give me a headache and a sneezing frenzy. But the Yardley has a very subtle and pleasant scent. And the soap was not too drying. It left my skin very soft and glowing.The expensive stuff from USA or Europe is miles better than the local or Indian crap.

This is the first time Ive used any Chiseled Face product and HOLY SMOKES is the performance excellent.  I test lathered and then bowl lathered to learn the soap.  The lather produced thick stiff peaks quickly but it still felt sticky between the fingers.  I added more water  times but it still felt sticky.  I lathered whiskers and BOOM slick.  First pass was an effortless glide.  Second XTG and third ATG were just as effortless.  The lather seems very forgiving to whip up but also to shave with.  If I had to find a bone to pick it would be an immeasurably small amount of dryness in the postshave feel that was almost unnoticeable.  Damn near perfect shave.  Biggest mistake was using the short comb on my side burns.  I should know better.  My untrained nose detects huge rose and bergamot up front with citrus.

I went on a real soap acquisition bender and Ive been steadily trying each and every soap out. Well Ive tried them all and like them all thankfully. Now its time to bite into the samples I have piled up.Leviathan has an extremely distinct smoky smell. Is it pipe smoke or cigar smoke? Im not sure but its definitely smoky. I have all our windows open here at our apartment in Seoul and I honestly thought the smoke smell was coming from outside. Later I figured out it wasnt outside it was from Leviathan. As with all my experiences with BampM soaps the lather was top notch and very slick. This lather was far superior to last shaves lather with Italian Barbers LAmericano soap.Could I get nerdy for a second? Im a big proponent for encryption of everything. I want to congratulate WhatsApp for implementing endtoend encryption in the latest version of their messaging app for Android Windows Phone and iOS and some other OSes.

The guy already had some screws loose and theres no way in hell hes gonna be able to make a life with all thats happened to him physically and mentally as well as the media exposure. One of the more surprising things they covered for me was exactly how bad he shouldnt have been allowed in the military. I no offense to the coast Guard they have a hard job and deserve respect but damn if you cant hack it there theres no way you should pass even rudimentary screening and be recruited into the army and then sent off to a war zone. I of course dont have the background you do Im a college aged civilian but as much as I dont like the guy and hate how he put lives in danger because of stupid superficial reasons who joins the army and walks off because you were YELLED at just hearing about all that happened for what  years?

Really slick and the scent is good. I ended up doing the first pass with a straight razor Ive been working on honing. I need to do some work on smoothing out my hones apparently. I didnt realize how scratchy a newish DMT is. I think its one of the best finished edges Ive done so far but I think theres still room to improve it. I dont think its ready for prime time yet.

Seeing that you have tamed the c I be you will have no problems using the S. The Fine slant is very good too better than than the Merkur c in my opinion.
