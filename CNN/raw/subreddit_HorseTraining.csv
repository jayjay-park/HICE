5501807,0,t1_cwevctm,Haha thanks. I mean Ive ridden in Grand Prix I know what Im doing Im not super worried about what people on the internet think. But honestly this sounded like a safety issue. When it comes to the riders safety unfortunately sometimes we have to sacrifice the horses comfort. I dont have any admiration in people who hurt themselves. Horses can and will be dangerous. If it takes a slowtwist and some sliding reins for them to respect the rider thats the way it is. But that could just be from me riding Holsteiner stallions who are being trained for Puissance and arent messing around!,HorseTraining,cwewoeu,1,t5_2x3h4
