10105723,0,t1_dbongyb,I think you have some insecurities that you should talk to your husband about openly. Communicate to him how your feeling and give him and yourself a chance to address them. You seem to be open to nonmonogamy which seemed to work really well for you and you seemed to have a strong sense of trust in your relationship in those situations. That might have even come easily for you. We all have to do some work sometimes. We all get jealous some times. It seems like you have gotten to a point where you feel that certain thing you find sacred are being taken away. Those things were what made you secure confident and told you that you were loved. So long comment short. Start talking. You dont have to say Give it all up but you could say  Im not feeling special any more and  Is there certain things that we can share together that is special just for us?. Or even tell him what things you find importantwe guys can be thick at times! Again communicate your feelings without attacking him. Make him know how you feel and what you need and allow him to help be a solution.,monodatingpoly,dboscpz,5,t5_3hhfy
