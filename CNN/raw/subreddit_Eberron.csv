7020900,0,t3_4bt0ip,I like youre idea curious to see how it goes. I think his reason for being kicked out should relate to what hes trying to do now. Maybe he decided that Warforged are the only true good race and that all other races are too inherently evil. Other angels recognized this is kind of nuts and kicked him out so he starts his own cult and thats how the plot began. ,Eberron,d1c642c,2,t5_2ubfw
7236469,0,t1_d20l0ma,If you have the chance to check out the XenDrik book or the Exploers guid they have great idea maps stuff to build plots around.  You could also mix both urban and dungeon crawling in Stromreach.  ,Eberron,d20qfuu,2,t5_2ubfw

7701258,0,t1_d3gwkbi,Oh I just remembered.  I think Keith Baker once compared the Mror Dwarves to rappers theyre aspirational new money and so they wear it on themselves to flaunt their status and success.  ,Eberron,d3hkyc4,1,t5_2ubfw

10216161,0,t1_dc1jqht,By the flame! I had no idea that supplement existed  Its super detailed and has a lot of standalone mechanics that I can make use of in the current situation Thanks for calling it out. Ill review your advice again once Im up to speed on naval maneuvers.,Eberron,dc225hn,1,t5_2ubfw
10357241,0,t1_dci1h3i,The Aurum is currently the front runner to play the Zhentarim in Rise of Tiamat. HotDQ is mostly going to be zoomedin but RoT includes a lot of international politics and I want to be sure I dont have to retcon anything if when! my players get there.,Eberron,dci1y14,1,t5_2ubfw
10702015,0,t3_5sycsc,Stormreach is not really on the verge of political social collapse as far as cannon is concerned. As already stated the city is run by the Storm Lords.This spirit would definitely have gone after the Storm Lords. I think if you want to cause the most chaos at first he would likely have gone after the Harbor Lord and and brought trade into the Harbor to a halt. Obviously pissing off the Coin Lords but he is one of the Storm Lords after all and has his own power.,Eberron,ddju0hl,2,t5_2ubfw
10962580,0,t3_5wjlya,As far you amnesia this is ripe for story line. You wont need an answer soon. But you can tie it into the Feywild if you want. Or you can tie it into the Last War or the mechaniations of the Lords of Dust or Dragon Below. He could have been used for some sort of dark eldritch device that stole his memory.Or even depending you campaign maybe it is an effect of the Mournland. Maybe he was in Cyre on the Day of Mourning. Maybe he was involved in the reason and this was a byproduct.,Eberron,deapo6z,2,t5_2ubfw
