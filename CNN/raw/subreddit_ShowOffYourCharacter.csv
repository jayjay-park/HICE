1841430,0,t1_ckb1dy3,I agree that I like the more epic scope of DAO though I actually have a slight preference for the romance options in DA. I usually romance male characters whether Im playing a male or a female character and in DAO Alistair is pretty sweet but kind of worships your character and it was just a little too fairy tale romance for me. While Zevran is fine as a character I dont particularly like romancing him. In DA the male LIs can also be kinda cheesy but its not quite as bad as with Alistair.Other than scope and romance options I think DA is mostly just different rather than better or worse. Although I agree that the waves of enemies are pretty stupid. I think it would be more fun to either get all of them at once and have to plan your pulls or have fewer but beefier enemies that you also need to put more planning into taking down.There are two mage gameplay styles in DAO that I like. My favorite is the kind of build I have with the character in this post an arcane warrior. I go spirit healer as either first or second spec along with arcane warrior. Arcane warriors dont get to be as good until they get more of their abilities in the spec so Id probably recommend picking up the first ability but not using the playstyle until you get at least the second if not third point in the spec line. I would also strongly recommend bringing Lelianna along with you and having her use the bard ability that increases your attack rating. If you have it Id also use Heroic Offense on your arcane warrior as that also increases attack rating. Your attack rating will be a lot worse than a similar level warrior tank but once youve gotten your third or fourth point in arcane warrior you will be basically unkillable.The other really nice build for mages is a pure caster build. It doesnt really matter how you spec it though a lot of people go for blood mage with a caster build. As long as you put most of your points into offensive spells and carry lots of mana and health pots with you youre pretty much unstoppable. Before I had my main character go arcane warrior I had a party with her as the healer Alistair as the tank Morrigan as a pure caster and Lelianna as my utility rogue. I took on the high dragon and everyone but Morrigan died. I then soloed the high dragon with Morrigan chugging potions and casting lots of frost spells. There are a few utility spells youll want to grab like a basic heal maybe a defensive spell and any spell you can use for spell combinations but stick mostly to primal andor spirit spells. Speaking of spirit spells mana clash is incredibly powerful against enemy mages. You can often oneshot mages with it if you use it at the start of combat when their mana is full. Make sure you save before entering any combat you plan to use it in though as Ive had my game crash a number of times when using it because the engine doesnt seem to like that much damage happening so suddenly. P Crushing prison is also pretty powerful as it immobilizes most enemies while doing significant damage.,ShowOffYourCharacter,ckb37k6,1,t5_2yuod
