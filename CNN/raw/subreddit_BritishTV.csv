4743194,0,t1_ctseo97,Of course yeah its an intrinsically Irish programme because of all those things. I remember the entire cast being described as everyone in Ireland who has ever told a joke which is largely true of the comedians in Ireland at the time. They still book big gigs with Father X from Father Ted or similar.I err on the side of defining it as a British sitcom because of the commissioning but also because to an extent it was pitched as a very surreal window to look in at rural Ireland from elsewhere the UK.At the time a lot of Irish people were horrified at it and some still are mostly older people because of the supposed digs at the church of which there are actually very few. Of course the same horrified people are huge fans of Mrs Browns Boys so obviously was more to do with their own personal hang ups than the actual programme.I guess for me it boils down to the fact that it could never have worked in Ireland and only came to be because it was a British production. But yeah thats probably my own frustration at the poor comedy output of IrelandNI.,BritishTV,ctsfa9n,3,t5_2rzot

The rules of him keeping his watch were that he must not use it to commit crimes or hurt anyone. Every episode focused on Bernard or someone to whom hed lent the watch facing a problem or simply doing daytoday stuff and trying to sort it out using the watch.Unless of course he didnt use the watch to do rapes in which case the whole rapist angle would be really weird.,BritishTV,cylexgi,1,t5_2rzot

I loved it but for completely different reasons than I loved the UK version for.Ive lived in the US for  years and its fairly obvious to me that mainstream comedy here is focused on warm fuzzy feelings whereas UK comedy is generally more about getting that awkward yet relatable sensation.

I know its a BBC show but that doesnt mean it should be free to everyone around the world.For starters its probably made by a separate production company who may retain the rights for when it gets shown on Dave etc. And allowing full episodes free reign on YouTube means in other countries where they sell the episodes those channels will get fewer viewers because people have already seen it or can just see it for free. It doesnt gain them more audience if that audience isnt paying indirectly.Now for UK people at least it would be great if the BBC could put all old shows on iPlayer for everyone to view as they please like Netflix.
