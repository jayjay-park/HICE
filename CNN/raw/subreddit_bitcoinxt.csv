4884742,0,t3_3hsc45,Market forces are a very real and powerful thing. I just wish there was a better term for this phenomenon. That term has been politicized and lumped in with the right wing agenda much like the term global warming has been politicized and lumped in with the left wing agenda. Really at the end of the day its the science that should stand on its own. A term like market forces ought to be apolitical. But of course the world is not perfect.Anyway I liken market forces to the very same sort of forces that govern evolution and natural selection. Things work according to natural laws. Equilibriums are discovered. There are ebs and flows to the entire process of growth. The takeaway here is there is no need for a central planner to try and delegate every little aspect of how the network should grow. What we should be doing are things that help facilitate growth. Things like optimizations. Things that bring more utility and value to Bitcoin such as mutlisig. And of course more space allowed on the blockchain when growth demands it.What we should not be doing is trying to prematurely force a fee market from a centralized topdown approach when the entire thing is a free market issue. How is such central planning from the Core developers around Bitcoins economy any different from central bankers trying to manipulate the free market? It is no different. Rather than letting the market play out for itself and discover equilibrium we have worrisome devs who want to micromanage the Bitcoin economy themselve. No devs. That is not your role.Satoshi planted the seed. The devs job is to help it grow not confine it to a pot that is too small. I know its scary thinking that transplanting to a bigger pot might kill the plant. But they seem to forget how incredibly resilient this plant is. Just let it grow.,bitcoinxt,cua9dob,4,t5_38gou

5052206,0,t3_3k23mr,Realworld examples of the guardian or enforcer versus commercial or trader  innovator mentalitiesCommercial or trader  innovatorAn example of the commercial or trader  innovator mentality would be the business or academic world where making a better mousetrap is more important than submitting to hierarchy or mindlessly repeating the mistakes of the past. Corporations or scientists who blindly obey authority rather than questioning and innovating are less successful over time because they cant keep up with a changing world  so in this camp its perfectly ok to strike out on your own and see if you can do better than your old boss or teacher. This camp is about adapting to a changing world not about just obeying orders or blindly clinging to rules and traditions in the face of change. The profit motive is important in the commercial world  those who arent efficient and innovative fall by the wayside. The commercial mentality innovates and trades  and within its sphere of application it works quite well. If you are a lifelong conservative with a passion for obeying authority it may come as a sort of relief to just be able to recognize this fact  innovation and questioning DOES have its place in the world of human endeavors. Science and commerce would not be where there are today if somebody didnt break the rules.Guardian or enforcer mentalityAn example of the guardian or enforcer mentality would be the police or the military where following orders is more important than being creative or questioning authority.In that sort of world being able to rely on a chain of command is more important than being able to question authority because without authority these sorts of hierarchies fall apart or enforce the wrong rules. The police or the military wouldnt function very well if each member were able to question or make up the rules as they went along  which means that when theres a conflict between obeying orders and being right obeying orders wins. This camp is about obeying and enforcing the existing rules not about finding alternative or better ways of doing things. The profit motive is unheardof in the enforcer camp  soldiers and police do what they do out of a sense of duty not out of a desire for booty. The enforcer mentality just enforces the rules  and within its sphere it also works quite well. If you are a lifelong liberal who loves to question everything it may come as a sort of relief to just be able to recognize this fact  kneejerk obedience and submission to authority DOES have its place in the world of human endeavors. When you dial  in order to report a crime you dont expect the cop who shows up to break the rules.As we can see both types of morality have their place in the world and things run pretty smoothly if each minds its own business. Monstrous hybrids Jacobs also points out examples where the two camps sometimes merge producing what she calls a monstrous hybrid. An example was cited where a police force adopted a number of performance indicators including the number of arrests made. Individual police officers were paid on this basis. However some police were unfairly arresting people to boost their own salaries. In this case a productivity measure such as the number of arrests made is appropriate for a commercial outfit but not a guardian institution such as a police force.Americas strange civil forfeiture laws which reward police by letting them keep confiscated assets may be another example of this kind of monstrous hybrid. Another monstrous hybrid Jane Jacobs cites is the Mafia  a police organization with a profit motive.One interesting historical example Jacobs cites to support her proposal is the ancient taboo on nobility the enforcers dabbling in trade commerce. She theorizes that this longstanding taboo may have been intended to prevent just such a monstrous hybrid from occurring knights of old were part of the military and their job was simply to enforce  not to go around plundering and succumbing to a profit motive which they did of course do sometimes with the wellknown negative results.Shouldnt the guardian and the commercial camps coexist in American society?American society is going through some very difficult times today  and much of it may be due to a failure to recognize as legitimate both the guardianenforcer and the commercialtrader impulses in human nature.These two moral camps seem to be very ingrained in the human psyche and it does seem to be very hard to talk a person from one camp over to the other side  or even for a person from one camp to talk to a person from the other. But it may be that we need BOTH mentalities in order to function as a society. If the enforcers would stay in their place and the innovators would stay in theirs maybe things would work a whole lot better  and we could stop shouting at each other trying in vain to unite the two opposing and necessary camps into one.If these two moral mindsets characterize human nature and have their place in human society what does that say about the debates we are now seeing between conservatives and liberals? Do we have to all go over to one side or the other  or would it be better to just recognize the strengths and weaknesses of each school of morality and divvy up the tasks accordingly? Let the hierarchical enforcers run our military and our police and let the freewheeling innovators run our businesses and schools.If both of camps are useful systems of survival for the human race provided each ethic is applied to the right area  guardians for enforcement innovators for efficiency shouldnt we be looking at ways to acknowledge the differences between the two accept them and accommodate them both in our society where appropriate?We may also find that in Bitcoin itself both camps are necessary eg the maximum number of  millions is something which must be guarded and enforced  versus things which need to evolve depending on technology and number of users such as the block size where innovation is allowed.,bitcoinxt,cuuzdhc,2,t5_38gou

At the end of the day thats really all that matters.The block size issue isnt easily solved but not because there isnt a way to measure opinion or support. Its because there are different ideas on what the best approach is in the long run. Since nobody can predict the future there is room for reasonable people to disagree. This is why Ive always felt the best answer to such major protocol decisions is to get them out of the way early on the earlier the better in the life of the cryptocurrency. Then let the free market determine which models work and which dont.There are a few key decisions which I think should always be done up front and be locked in and never change coin inflation schedule block time and block size. Hashing algorithm is arguably another one but it should be modifiable in an emergency.

5392376,0,t1_cw0wq4l,gt but miners are free to be making these small blocks right now. why arent they doing it? in fact when given a chance to harvest full blocks of fees they do it.They arent doing it because this rule isnt in place. Once you create a rule like this the miners behaviors will change to reduce risk of mining orphan blocks.gt a few years ago a guy called Mystery Miner mined nothing but  tx blocks for a few months. he stopped eventually. pools would never get away with that bc they would be neglecting their responsibility to the network which their hashers wouldnt appreciate and thus leave and they are passing up what little fees there are right now which will only grow in the future with bigger blocks and the transition away from rewards.Yea but they would also leave if the pool started working on orphan blocks. Which is possible with an unknown max block size so its in the pools best interest to mine a smaller block instead of a larger one. If we want variable max block size  would be better to have a deterministic dynamic max block size instead of per node unknown block sizes.,bitcoinxt,cw0xpqx,1,t5_38gou

5401735,0,t1_cw23miy,....get your head out of your ass for a second will you?Realistically BIP has support from two entities a certain subset of the Bitcoin industry and a small contingent of loud mouths on reddit and various forums.  On the other hand the list of strong opposition to XT is rather considerable... First the attempt to convert the peers in the network nodes failed spectacularly and has gained little to no traction at all. Your group then attempted to move the goal posts and focus on miners acceptance where you got promptly shut down in similar fashion. Your understanding of Bitcoins distribution of power is rather curious as well. To begin with miners hold no such veto. Miners are only interested in running the code supported by the economic majority which is better represented by the peers in the network full nodes. Another blatant confusion in your analysis is who creates Bitcoins value. It certainly is not the merchants lmao the exchanges wallets of payment processors. While they may provide valuable services to certain participants they are only a result of the demand from Bitcoin holders. To be clear bitcoin owners and more precisely holders are the ones responsible for its value. Now for the sake of the argument Im going to pretend that the opinion of Bitcoin holders is divided. That said it has been made increasingly clear over the past few months that BIP has failed in garnering support from a supermajority of two of the most important economic entities in the network nodes and miners. If you still hold any faith into your little project I would advise you consider and come to peace with these facts. Ive repeatedly suggested that your groups falling would be your constant misrepresentation of support for your side. It shows yet again in your post. ,bitcoinxt,cw24qnm,2,t5_38gou

5430304,0,t1_cw5r1d0,This is actually a fairly complicated issue. There are several categories of wallet where the answer would vary.If youre running the reference client as a wallet then obviously your transactions will be performed on the chain that the consensus code in your fullnode client supports.If you are running a peertopeer SPV wallet like Breadwallet or Bitcoin Wallet on Android then whichever chain has more proof of work is going to be the chain that your wallet recognizes.If youre running a wallet that uses an indexing server or centralized API then the chain that you will be on is based on what the provider does or the specific server you connect to does. Examples at this moment are Electrum Mycellium Airbitz these connect to an indexing server although from what I understand Mycellium and Airbitz either support or plan to support a peertopeer mode and Coinbase Circle Blockchain.info these connect to a private API.,bitcoinxt,cw5rz93,1,t5_38gou

I think peoplma is correct and it really wouldnt make much difference either way.Part of my logic was that at least this way with a  weeks interval the hashrate is sustained for a period long enough to overlap several instances of  block periods for the sake of BIPs activation algorithm. And secondly it allows the hashrate to stay sustained long enough for others to join in a contributive effort before funds are depleted.,bitcoinxt,cw76y3p,3,t5_38gou

5975839,0,t1_cy2wfta,RBF is within the realm of node policy which are decisions that are not enforced by the network and are up to each individual node operator to make. Nodes which use RBF process the same blockchain using the same rules as nodes which dont use RBF. No agreement is necessary between any two nodes. So the code implementing policy can be changed by literally anyone and doesnt need any kind of common agreement to be deployed whether it be a single node or widespread. Note also that transaction replacement as in RBF is only possible before the transaction is mined into the blockchain when there is no defined order of transaction  so it is impossible to make either RBF or firstseen a consensus rule instead of policy.The block size limit on the other hand is a rule that determines what blocks and blockchain are valid and is enforced by every node on the network not just miners. All nodes must agree on these kind of rules to interoperate at all on the same blockchain. This is why they are called consensus rules and why changing them has such a high bar every node must make the change together so if there is significant disagreement over the change that cannot reasonably be accomplished. If Core developers simply changed these on our own without general agreement from the community the result would be a network running with two incompatible definitions of what constitutes a valid blockchain and never coming to a common consensus on it which is the whole point of the blockchain in the first place.,bitcoinxt,cy2ypjz,3,t5_38gou

6028880,0,t1_cy9r9o0,Hey dgenrmerry christmasthank you for looking critically at my proposal. I think you misinterpreted an important aspect.I think it is actually censorship resistant because only a message containing both invalidated transactions into one message is a valid marked doublespend. The first one that was received by a node still can and has to be transmitted immediately. The node only reacts on seeing the second one.But this way an attacker has now has to send the doublespend immediately to the network because if he does not the network will broadcast its invalidated doublespend instantly because almost anyone already has seen the first initially valid transaction of this doublespend attempt.My argument is that now that he would have to send the doublespend immediately rather than later the receiving person is able to detect this within seconds rather than up to  minutes to the next block. So we made sure that an doublespend has to be instantly and secondly made it censorship resistant only someone that observed both transactions can forge a valid and verifyable double spend warning and thirdly made it in a way that the transaction can be made unmineable and  safely broadcastable which is the key improvement to BitcoinXT doublespend relay mechanism that is criticized for that reason.I hope that was a more precise. cheersMichael,bitcoinxt,cy9wmeb,1,t5_38gou

With segwit the light client could prove to itself that the transaction amounts were complete and correct without the signatures.  That being said I agree with the sentiment that the benefits of segwit or overstated.  ,bitcoinxt,cz3in57,1,t5_38gou
