8040522,0,t3_4p9b12,Idk if this would work but AdoptAShen. Basically the older shen players try and help the newer ones. Just an idea tho ,Shen,d4jtw78,2,t5_2tlaw
8353346,0,t3_4ds0j0,Aight so Hi Im still fairly new to the game and by that I mean that I literally just hit level  like  min ago. Anyway so I gave Shen a go while he was free last week and I really really enjoyed him which prompted me to pick him up permanently. Ive been playing him both Jungle and Top but have been having more success in the Jungle. When I have brought Shen Top I have been getting really brutalized in the lane phase getting zoned from farm not being able to trade effectively etc... For example in my most recent game against a Darius I was at like  cs  or so minutes in. Luckily he wasnt able to kill me in lane and I was able to stay relevant via roaming with Ult and catching waves after he took my tier  tower but you see my dilemma. So basically I say all that to ask you guys What are some ways I can have a healthierstronger lane phase as Shen? ,Shen,d5lpz5a,1,t5_2tlaw
8778362,0,t3_503gg9,Although the reworked shen abilities arent hitting the mark and although I miss the old shen I have to say the rework did improve him.He went from a dull boring sustain machine to a semi skilled position focused mega tank. I personally loved the sustain shen had on his old Q and his passive looked really nice when auto attacking however his Q was a point and click ranged ability he could spam non stop because of his energy. It was boring for shen as all he had to do was press Q and that was it. His W was just completely useless late game it would just be an energy drain now I think shens more difficult which in turn makes him slightly more fun. However he just doesnt feel right atm idk what it is hes not exactly exciting but nor is he a downgrade post rework.Apart from that his new model and skins are fucking incredible best skin line in the game IMO.,Shen,d72yq8k,2,t5_2tlaw

9169993,0,t1_d8dnsho,Yea I hear you you hit everything just right and then after the combo is done... no energy for any followups. It leaves you bear ass naked with no escape and these puny aas.,Shen,d8ed5bw,3,t5_2tlaw

10738613,0,t3_5tkk9a,He is doing well because Shen doesnt care that much about lane dominance and lane bully champions like Jayce. Like Singed being picked against Poppy The champion itself isnt the reason. ,Shen,ddnluy2,3,t5_2tlaw
10869335,0,t1_de12n8d,Im usually getting Zz Rot if my team is struggling with securing objectives on the map. The autopush will eventually get a turret by itself while it also gives me the freedom to rivershen around the map without sacrificing my own turret. ,Shen,de13ewb,2,t5_2tlaw
11136541,0,t3_5ywelv,Just make his ult teleport him inmediately after the shield breaks either because of damage or after it runs out after the  second duration. This way you incentivize using Shens ult defensively to save an ally giving him the ability to immediately E or W to help further protect whoever was ulted after the shield breaks while also making it a less reliable tool for aggressive playmaking because of the increased teleport delay when the ulted teammate is not in danger.,Shen,deubdq8,1,t5_2tlaw
