I maneuvered around all the cars and saw most people on the phone on the side of the road. It was still dark so I did not see a duffle on the other side nor did I know to look there.

Yosh is by appointment only and is expensive but for a European GQ type guy might be just the activity it takes a few hours to do the whole process and testing for him. Le Labo is cheaper but still pricey around  per bottle they do unique unisex fragrances that are madetoorder right in front of you at their industrialchic store. Either way your friend will leave SF with a custom cologne that he could only have got from here but can reorder from Germany if he runs out of it from either store.

Zinc Details Interiorhome store with a Californiaminimalistmodern take on things. Spice Ace A big and very well curated collection of differentinterestingartisan spices and herbs. Stuff you cant buy in a grocery store.

All kinds of meat rubs and really unique stuff for bakingsweets and IndianThai spices.  Clary Sage Organics Organic sustainable modern items from clothing to home to bathpersonal products. Its NOT a hippieearthy place but more a highend organic boutique. I think Whole Foods carries them now but this is the storefront and only physical location. Jonathan Adler A longtime top name in interior design all kinds of stuff for your house. Its a pop art meets modern vibe.

256572,0,t1_cf75e9e,According to a recent economic impact study on NBA teams gt  Most consumers have a relatively inflexible leisure budget. The more time and money that is spent on a sports team the less is available for movies restaurants golf bowling amusement parks theaters and concerts. Similarly the more that people spend at restaurants and clubs near a stadium the less they will spend elsewhere within the metro area. The net effect of a new team or stadium on consumption in theteams local community is likely to be close to zero although sports teams do cause a significant amount of shifting of leisure budgets within the local area.

Thats what growth and money does even if it leaves a coppery taste in the mouths of the sensitive.Moreover the district supes are pretty darned community focused but I doubt this soontobegraduate of a private university has seen them in action.

578538,0,t1_cg612te,True but the rental rates are at the margin. So a landlord without rent control doesnt have to worry about making a mistake in current pricing. But since a landlord only needs one desperate renter heshe can hold out at a higher rate and wait for one tenant to come along that wants the apartment. Unlike widgets where pricing is based on selling multiple items an apartment has only one unit so pricing is totally different than in many other businesses. Basically the landlord is forced by RC to wait for that one tenant that will overpay now. Renting is not a perfect market due to the small  of transactions so waiting can yield a price that may not be one that a landlord could get today.,sanfrancisco,cg618k4,1,t5_2qh3u

786977,0,t1_cgtpb88,Hey Im one of the Red Cross people who was on scene.  Since you might have left before this happened one update is that the Building Inspector came and left a yellow tag for the building which officially restricts occupancy overnight.  This makes it a bit harder for the landlord to get everything opened up requires more permits inspections which may affect how soon everyone can get back in.  Its a little bit unusual generally lack of electricity alone is not enough for them to officially forbid living there.Although it seems bad as soon as your landlord can get one of the remediation companies working there were three of them waiting on scene to try and get the contract theyll be able to get most of the building pretty close to normal within a few days.

We are chihuahuas her strict and traditional father would bark at her. We have always been a pure line of chihuahuas and no pound mutt is going to pollute that. Not with MY daughter.Her friends would try to help her get over it. Theres a new shorthair that hangs out in front of the coffee shop on Valencia. His name is Ramon. He has really nice eyes! Her heart would always ache for him and his big fluffy tail. All she had now was her fond memories of begging for corndogs in front of Disneyland and digging through trash cans on the North Shore of Oahu. Gwen would take other lovers in her life even bearing six beautiful pups with Hector the grandson of a champion but she would never be as happy as she once was. Her life would be unexpectedly cut short by complications related to the ingestion of a large amount of dark chocolate. Though her death would be ruled an accident many of her closest friends would question whether or not she simply couldnt live with the pain of lost love any longer. At the funeral long after most of the guests had left the pet cemetery a small husky mix would saunter up to the grave drop a small yellow VW bus squeaky toy crouch down on his elbows with his rear end in the air let out a single soft whimper and then run off. He had his closure and was finally free of his own pain. edit Holy Jesus! Nobody ever gave me gold before! Thank you! What should I do?

Its mostly bias coming into play here too. When a car breaks a rule especially not indicating it has a much bigger impact on a cyclist since its a potentially very injurious situation so you remember it more. When a bike does something its no big deal to another cyclist. Enforcement of laws should be equal and moving violation fines should be the same for any vehicle type. Punishment in court cases should be based on damages. If you kill someone on a bike that should be punished the same as if you kill someone in a car. I do think some laws should be changed about cycling and red lights but there shouldnt be a case where someone goes through a red light and doesnt think theyre breaking the law.

2005930,0,t1_ckuryhf,You make good points but an oft overlooked aspect of the ferry services around the bay is readiness for emergency response. In the event of a disaster taking out  bridges in the area ferries will serve an integral transit need. Obvious examples being the golden gate ferry after the Marin mudslides in  and Oakland ferry service in . This is why so many of the ferry lines operate at a loss because their other function is transit redundancy. So the subsidies are about a lot more than just cutting automobile use. Pretty disappointing the article you posted doesnt address this at all. Since the fleet needs to be ready to be up and running should emergency strike it makes sense to include them in regular service. And I do think having multiple public transit options connecting the disparate parts of the region has an innate value to our local society.,sanfrancisco,ckuwv7p,1,t5_2qh3u

2039687,0,t3_2i3pn1,The drivers in this city are horrible but its not just the drivers many cyclists seem to ride as if theyre invincible.  As a cyclist and motorcyclist I think its is a suboptimal strategy for them.For example just tonight at  P.M. after dark I was driving down Market towards the Ferry Building and was turning right on th st.  I had my turn signal on for at least  seconds before turning and when the traffic moved so I was clear to turn I started turning right on th.  As I do a cyclist blows by me on the right swerving out of the way and screaming about checking my mirrors.  Well I did check my mirrors but since he was dressed in all black with no lights reflective gear or even a helmet shininess makes them more visible I didnt see him.  Also he should know not to be going right around a vehicle with a right turn signal on.Now I recognize that as the operator of the moving death machine aka car I have more responsibility to be conscious of the safety of cyclists around me and that in the event of an accident I would be principally liable.  All of this I agree with.  BUT cyclists do need to take responsibility and not do stupid shit like this to save  seconds. Even the safest most conscientious driver will make mistakes and cyclists would do well to ride defensively and mitigate risk as much as possible even if they have the right of way.Source Im a motorcyclist who rides like everyone on the road is trying to kill me.

2714980,0,t1_cnc2i97,Heres the problem with setting up housing in that style. I do support public services for people in all situations but there are some realities to the situation that need to be accounted for. Resources must be spent in a way to treat all people in the most humane way and if we were to simply give out public housing without additional support the quality of living would quickly decline to the point where it would be no more humane than the current system. Two we need universal access to mental health service however we also need to bring back involuntary institutionalization. A lot of people are so far gone they will refuse to receive help. Helping the yelling schizophrenic person on the subway might sometimes require taking them to a doctor no matter what they say about it and thats just reality. Third regarding location and where resources come from. San Francisco can help people who became homeless in this city but they cant help everyone who floods in behind them because we provide good services. This must be a national response and treatment and aid of individuals while they should be integrated with a given citys community cant be guaranteed to house everyone within San Francisco. Most cities just bus their issues around but a real response would be a national coordinated effort. ,sanfrancisco,cncokwc,2,t5_2qh3u

2837139,0,t3_2sjshn,I will give my still armchair opinion as an Econ grad who works in real assets research in the cityIn short  rent growth cant keep accelerating like it has because of new supply coming online but low vacancy and strong demand are not going away. Supply is not so bad as this sub suggests developers see the low vacancy and cap rates and they can get through even SFs tough laws see  units on mission next to Alamo draft house word of big mission bay developments. These will affect price even with the pent up demand for apartments which is already priced in. Demand story is not really changed SF is still an engine of jobs and rising salaries. The one thing that might cause a hiccup is rising interest rates slowing the economy a little but I wouldnt hold your breath for it trickling down to your rent much. Basically people will pay to live here as long as it is a vibrant high employment city. Rents could actually drop if we have a recession or SF becomes irrelevant as a city but personally neither of those would make me very happy.God speed to all you apartment hunters out there you can do it. ,sanfrancisco,cnqkv4h,3,t5_2qh3u

Id love to see more building up the way Downtown Redwood City is going but it wont be nearly enough. Caltrain needs at least trains every min and BART should probably be extended to  increase transit capacity into SF and  potentially remove stations from Caltrain to increase speed and decrease time between key SF gt SJ destinations. BART is better in combination with up zoning but I have a hard time thinking San Mateo County is going to accept density beyond a few midsize developments.Oakland also really needs to step up its game to absorb commercial and residential growth especially outside of the tech sector in many cases.

2929836,0,t1_cnyxdkv,The only real benefit from the driver standpoint is the ability to park in the yellow zonesmeters not red unless you have  wheels. The state gets an extra  to cover the extra wear and tear on the roads by the rideshare vehicles. All in all like you said it seems like this is a political power move fueled by an organization against the rideshare industry. If the state requires drivers to apply for commercial plates its going to cause a huge downtime in their ability to work and many of them will not be motivated enough to go through the long process. I actually applied for commercial plates for my hatchback so that I can park in yellow zones I do a lot of delivery driving in the city and the process is rather simple but time consuming. It entails this. Taking your vehicle to a weightmaster to get a certificate of weight. I called auto shops around the city that were trying to charge  lol for this until I found a garbage company that did it for ..

We could go on and on thank you thank you! but back to your great questions...  Polk Street has been the focus of our attention recently because the project is quickly approaching final approval  and its one of the most dangerous and traveled routes in the city for people biking.  Polk Street is also a key piece of the city achieving Vision Zero ending all traffic deaths and serious injuries by .  If big bold changes dont happen on Polk theres no way we can achieve Vision Zero.  Thats why were pushing so hard for a design that includes protected bike lanes from McAllister to Union  and anyone reading this who wants to join us at the SF Municipal Transportation Agency meeting on Tuesday wed love to have your voice!.But of course theres a lot more going on besides Polk Street.  Anyone biking around San Francisco on a regular basis knows there are a ton of ways we need to improve things.Unrelated to specific streets weve been working hard on getting better police enforcement of the five most dangerous traffic behaviors on our streets which gets at your second question which is right on  there is a lot of work that must happen on this front plus recently led a campaign against doubleparking in bike lanesBut there are plenty of onthestreet changes you can get excited about in  that were working on that arent about Polk !  The installation of permanent concrete barricades on Oak and Fell will happen this spring creating the fully protected bike lane weve worked for over the past decade. The very first raised bike lane in San Francisco on Valencia south of Chavez. Improvements to Market Street including a raised bike lane between th and Gough Streets and new turn restrictions on cars coming that will essentially ban private auto traffic on Market between rd and th Streets. Enhanced crosswalks traffic diversions and improved protections for people on bikes on the Wiggle. A new parkingprotected bike lane on Bay Street in the Marina. Wining a new Embarcadero greenway with key decisions by SFMTA and the Port happening by the end of the year.  Green paint buffers and protective soft hit posts coming to Howard Street west of th Street. New green paint physical protection and a safer crossing under the freeway ramp coming to Folsom near Essex.,sanfrancisco,coyckqc,3,t5_2qh3u

Gentrification has left essentially no urban city in the U.S. untouched. Ed Lee does not have the power to prevent this. Because San Francisco is so desirable and has such cultural and economic richness naturally reurbanization has affected us more than most other cities along with Los Angeles New York City Boston etc...All we can do is ensure we arent left behind by the shifting global economy and do what we can to mitigate its polarizing effects on the rich and poor. I agree with his policies to ramp up market rate housing development. I think the effects its having arent readily apparent because weve been underdeveloping for so long but if we start building up now and dont stop eventually the sudden influx of wealth into SF will slow and well start to stabilize housing prices.,sanfrancisco,cprpuq6,14,t5_2qh3u

Some companies will have to sell their farmland at a loss and idle the almond orchard. Some people are going to be flooded out of their homes and businesses. This is all going to happen whether or not we change how water is apportioned in California. If we act responsibly now we can make those painful changes more gradual easier to handle.

4228738,0,t1_cs27tr6,My point was that the individual is entitled to limited use of the property by virtue of his ownership. We decide on those limitations as a society and as a community. Those displaced individuals dont need more supply. What they need is stability. How supply effects stability is a larger issue that I feel unequipped to address.  gt Whats the point of ownership in this scenario? By extension whats the point of investment in general?Spot on. However you make the mistake of assuming that economic incentives are the only incentives that make society dynamic. Furthermore Im completely prepared to live in a static society if it means individuals are not displaced for the accumulation of wealth of certain individuals. I think its a mistake to equivocate property ownership with risk. The mortgage crisis demonstrated very clearly that the actual property owners banks were able to insulate themselves from risk. Furthermore the risk is typically economic and property investors have multiple mechanisms for minimizing this risk. In the case of rental properties the tenants share in some of the risk in the form of initial deposits yearlong leases and the rental income itself. In my understanding the income of fully leased buildings typically exceed the monthly mortgage payment. If the investor of the property has  initial capital plus insurance what risks is the investor taking?  Furthermore renters have the burden of noneconomic risks such as displacement from Ellisact evictions. Perceiving the only risks to be economic ones obscures other risks.,sanfrancisco,cs2970q,1,t5_2qh3u

Its really easy to screw up too because there are a lot of process steps that you shouldnt do in a highly corrosive environment that you can do for regular old steel thats going to be used in a land bridge somewhere inland. To be a little more specific and technical CalTrans kind of screwed up because they specified the steel rods to have a high hardness and I think the manufacturer selected a shitty alloy to cut costs something like using  high carbon instead of  which is both stronger and more corrosion resistant.  would have worked without additional processing but its pretty expensive even though we already dumped like b into the bridge. I dont remember that they did to make the  have a higher hardness but they did something funny that increased the stress on the surface and then galvanized the steel to get the corrosion resistance they wanted. Problem is that during the galvanization process you dip the steel in acid exposing it to a lot of hydrogen ions. ASTM A states Hydrogen Embrittlement becomes a huge deal when the stress on the steel exceeds approximately ksi and the ASTM guidelines actually say DO NOT GALVANIZE. So the steel manufacturer done goofed making those rods useless and costing another million dollars worth of repairs. Source my corrosion professor at UC Berkeley said it and it was on an exam. He could be lying or this could be confidential for all I know but if you look hard enough into technical newsjournals then youll find that hydrogen embrittlement was the cause of failure of a massive number of rods.,sanfrancisco,cszeky0,1,t5_2qh3u

Keep in mind what ever you calculate should be discounted further since increasing rent from x to y does not mean that the NOI Net Operating Income will increase by exactly that much.  Also uncertainty may also discount it.

4846606,0,t1_cu51zc9,Have you tried this family pass thing without children in tow?  For instance the Asian Art Museum which I actually used to have a membership to  so Im not a total freeloader says Family Pass  Free admission for up to two adults accompanied by up to four children.  Are the children required?  If I was going to spend a few hours at the museum Id happily pay full admission as supporting the arts is important to me but if I just want to pop in to see those Korean Celadon pots that I so love for a quick few minutes itd be awesome to be able to do so without paying the  admission fee.Even if Im excluded from this program due to my childlessness I think the program is REALLY great.  Id love to see it expanded to allow anyone under the age of  access to admission passes to all city attractions.  A high school kid who is even mildly interested in the arts should be encouraged to visit the cities museums.    Making it free for them to do so if they put in the effort to go to the library and check out a pass seems like a pretty good program to me.  ,sanfrancisco,cu5g8ng,3,t5_2qh3u

4915758,0,t1_cue287f,I dont think its controversial to note that SFUSD is currently facing an almost insurmountable chicken and egg problem.Which is the affluent population of SF has largely opted out from participating in public schooling.As a result the current percentage of SFUSD students who qualify as low income is on the order of  or more in this and other primary metrics ethnicity English as primary or second language household education SFUSD is extremely unrepresentative of San Francisco as a whole. This in turn drives district priorities leading to what I as a parent would describe as a death spiral.Many schools we toured for kindergarten were very frank about the fact that their number one priority was supporting underperforming studentsa population strongly correlated with low income. Regardless of ideology or political affiliation it is definitely a great deal to ask prospective affluent parents to accept that their wellperforming kids will be an afterthought when it comes to prioritizing resources in a school.The obvious result is a decision to look elsewhere e.g. in private school for an education that will place an equal premium on helping middle and highperforming students and gifted students reach their own potential.As with the Affordable Care Act a healthy pool of affluent and welleducated parents participating in SFUSD would create a resilient set of parents with comparatively deep pockets in both actual fundraising dollars and intangibles like time to contribute which would provide more resources for e.g. salaries and extras... ...as things are the healthy population is almost entirely opting out of publics.One casualty is a family like mine middle class by SF standards families of comparatively modest mans read unable to pay for private schooling even when philosophically amenable are the last served by the district. Sad to say the SFUSDs response has not been to aggressively court affluent families to achieve buyin to the system. Instead most energy seems to be on ensuring that any naturally emergent clusters of resources e.g. at trophy schools which the district perceives of as selfsegregation in class and ethnicity terms are disrupted c.f. the utterly failed CTIP preference policy.The current bubble is as far as I as a parent can tell merely exacerbating this problem wealthy families relocating to San Francisco appear to be participating in SFUSD with even less enthusiasm than preexisting natives. So yeah. SFUSD is paralyzed by yet actively contributing to its own inability to better reward teachers and administrators.I dont see any easy or politically feasible fixes to this short of totally inexpedient ideas like levying taxes on private school attendance to attempt to coerce larger participation andor fundraise for the starved district.  ,sanfrancisco,cue639w,14,t5_2qh3u

By people I dont just mean techies because I follow several housingtrade groups for nontechies in the city both out of curiosity and because Im not rich. What now happens is that three people making normal incomes split a onebedroom apartment or two to an SRO etc. Ive seen six adults in a singlefamily home looking for  to  roommates. That means that there is hidden demand for housing which will reappear if the people who can afford kmo start leaving. The people who now live four to an apartment will in all probability start taking up more space as soon as they are offered the chance. I should apologize for calling these people a problem because theyre generally not rich and their existence is rarely really acknowledged.I really dont know how anyone who pays even the slightest amount of attention could believe that SF is growing because of rich people. Rich people are by definition a minority if most people are rich we call it normal. For the last ten years people from all walks of life have chosen in great numbers and in many cities across the country to live in closetsized spaces so that they can have access to walkable neighborhoods and public transit that isnt just a way to shuffle workers downtown and back  public transit that serves the community for all of its transit needs.

He utterly failed to appreciate the value of the city to these firms and their workers and gave away a giant tax break. It got things moving more quickly but midmarkets redevelopment would have happened anyway the lack of available office space in the bay area would have seen to that.

5634619,0,t1_cwv3lbn,Heres my thoughts on it... I moved to the East bay in  when I was . I grew up with computers. I was  in  when I started high school. Back then being into computers was NOT cool. It was not the thing to do. However that was about the time computer related courses began to boom at my school and community. My first year of high school was the year it was required for everyone to take a basic computer class where we learned keyboarding and simple internet tasks. I loved computers they were my hobby. Learning networking QBasic programming HTML. I knew there was a future here and its what I liked.  my sophomore year of high school I took a regional occupation program classjob for computers. It was school credit but also got you into a real work place doing something with technology. Even when I was  my parents and grandparents use to tell me technology and computers were going to be the jobs of the future and they pushed me to keep at it. My Grandpa was retired from the army core of engineers. He was fascinated by what I could do on a computer although he would admit it was past his time to learn. He had no hate for them but he also knew what they were going to replace and change.So I moved to the Bay Area in   . It was the end of the tech boom and my dad had lost a lot of money in technology stocks. San Francisco had at least  less skyscrapers at that time. Google was just becoming popular and everyone my age had a Myspace.It was about that time when technology started becoming mainstream. When I say mainstream... I mean you were no longer the ostracized nerd for learning HTML or programming on your own. Back then if you said Im a coder. People didnt care or just thought you were in a nerd career. Today when you say Im a coder people look at you like you make K and you have the sweet life and somehow you have a douche bag personality by default. I would say before  most people who went into coding and programming did it because of the love for it and technology. Now I would say the majority do it because its a career that is in demand and makes a lot of cash.I would think its like when parents told there kids to become a lawyer in the s and s... because that is where the money and prestige is at. Now today its become a developer.I see kids coding now who in the past would probably be the same kids in the s to call me a loser because I spent too much time on my computer. However I think its for the better. Its nice to see female engineers and coders. Just  years ago society was telling girls that programming is a male or nerdy thing. A not so diverse work place... sucks.Anyway I seriously digress here. My point was... I was told by adults when I was younger to program get into computers its where the jobs and money will be. Here I am in the bay area and this has always been where those jobs are. Now its just popular and the booming industry. Most people in tech just want a job and security like everyone else. You cant blame the individuals. My skill set wouldnt get me very far in Oklahoma. San Francisco is the place to be for technology jobs. My skill set happens to align with what is in demand here. So it just makes sense for me to live and work here. So you have this entire generation of people that were brought up on technology who have those skill sets who need jobs. Those jobs are here. I feel bad for both sides. Ive always seen the problem as San Franciscos unwillingness to change or progress. No new housing strict rules on building... ,sanfrancisco,cwvj0oa,3,t5_2qh3u

Thats not how pricing works  someone has to value it at  for him to buy it at that price. The underlying costs are at the point its already in the gallery completely irrelevant. And so if no one is buying your artwork at  when it took close to that to create it you have to lower your price.

5936180,1,t1_cxxqspc,The problem with summary statistics like density is that they dont capture the reality very well.  Sure if you look at the Bay Area as a D rectangle then yes the density is somewhat low. But the population centers are aligned along  lines along the East Bay and along the Peninsula with a couple of spurs in between leading to WC and Livermore. Look Im not saying its easy. But to solve todays problems we need to rethink our past decisions.  I can assure you denser housing will not happen at the scale we need. No city in this area wants to put up  lowincome housing units along with the schools fire stations police libraries buses etc. that go with that. Its just. not. going. to. happen. But cheaper faster public transportation is possible and it is scalable.I know one of the drivers for the tech shuttles. He lives in Vallejo. He gets up at AM to drive down to San Jose to pick up the bus. From there he drives up to San Francisco to make the first pickup of techies at AM. Then he drives the bus back and forth I dont really know what his schedule is for the rest of the day but his last dropoff in SF is at PM. Then he drives back to San Jose drops the bus. Gets back into his car for the ride back home which he reaches around PM. A quick dinner get into bed and repeat the next morning. He has no time for his kids or his wife. If public transit was better and faster he could sleep on the train and get more time with his family. The wear and tear on him and his family and his car would be much lesser. ,sanfrancisco,cxxribk,1,t5_2qh3u

6127825,0,t1_cylfq6f,Heres the scoop. I used to work at a nice hotel downtown until recently. I worked near the lobby lounge which had many couches and dark areas. And I noticed teams of  beautiful girls would always come in around p. They never ordered anything but on occasion ONE would order an alcoholic beverage. In my naivety I asked them what the deal was in a friendly manner and they gladly told me. The new way if you will is to order them online. You can pick your girl and Im telling you they are beautiful and most probably compensated so  an hour. We have enough rich people located in our city as well as business travelers whom are fairly abundant in our city that they are paid the price never seen an incident with security afterwards. So in a nutshell order her online her pimp drives her and a teammate to the location ALWAYS another female and the pimp may be as well and the sober teammate waits and watches her back so no crazy shit goes down.

We just get some grungy grass for a month in the interim.gtWhats your brilliant way to pay for it then?Oh are you asking in the more general sense as our local Rec and Park liason? Sure Ill bite. The parks are underfunded sure. Historically park dollars just came from the general fund right? And all city departments thrivesuffer in unison. That was the way it worked for a long time. Now Ginsberg  and his analogues in other departments  have taken a cue from say the Water dept which has always had its own nearlyprivate revenue and expense stream with little oversight. This is what bugs me the monetization of the parks the new rangers and the general power grab.And it is imho a fools game. Every dollar of parkgenerated revenue will just likely be reduced by the mayor or Board Look! The parks have their own money now so we can cut our contribution to them! and it becomes a zerosum game.The analogy is California state schools being funded by the lottery. There has been no resulting net increase to school funding since the lotterys implementation postprop in the s.My brilliant way is to go back to the old way and just advocate for general fund dollars. That is not sexy government.

Beyond that the fact that there still are cheap houses on the south side and gentrification is slow in Chicago goes counter to the argument. Development on the north side is mitigating south side gentrification much as Krugman predicts.,sanfrancisco,cywphcz,2,t5_2qh3u

6497023,0,t3_44n1mi,There isnt much benefit for SF to host Super Bowl City and the experience as SF already gets a ton of tourists and sees nearly  occupancy for hotel rooms this time of year. I think on paper the revenues will displace the m everybody is chirping about but it wont really make sense for the rest of the people living and working in the city. Most of he businesses that will be getting business get business anyway and are near capacity. If anything it discourages San Franciscans from doing the norm. The real economic hit imo is work productivity in that area construction traffic etc is a huge impact that is difficult to see on paper but is likely way over that m.Santa Clara could have benefited hosting this much more than SF though it wouldnt be nearly as flashy for the NFL.

How are you going to accomplish something when youre not going to put in any effort?  People like her are mentally weak theyre all talking about changing their lives when theyre just doing the same thing everyday.  If I were her I would at least try and go to a public library use their computer ask someone for help and look for some kind of job or internship to get themselves started.  Its a proven fact that you are who you surround yourself with so with that in mind she needs to stop surrounding herself with other homeless people and start taking steps towards being a productive person to society.  And sure she cooks for her homeless friends but is that really helping society?  Sure it helps feed homeless people but the only thing shes teaching the other homeless people is that you can still survive in the city without having to actually do anything.

7265688,0,t3_4es0c5,Redfin Chief Economist Nela Richardson said in a release that the share of Redfin agents offers that faced bidding wars fell to  from  last year. This suggests that the price drop is not about inventory its about buyers fed up with high Bay Area prices and crazy competition she said. How does a decrease in bidding wars indicate that the price drop is about people giving up as opposed to increasing inventory? That is suppose that the number of homes increased and thus the ratio of homesbuyers has increased.

Pack it in pack it out works great for latter and even if ignored the impacts are minimal.However given the volume of people that Dolores sees the availability of refuse disposalremoval and the nature of the visitors taken into account its naive to expect Leave no Trace mentality.This isnt a groundbreaking Recreation Management idea this is something park planners venue planners party planners etc. see time and time again and in most cases take simple steps to avoid.The park when full exists in a kind of moral vacuum.  People throw things away until the trash is full.  Then someone stacks a box somewhere and folks see it and it becomes acceptable behavior.You and I both know thats not acceptable behavior and that its downright harmful but thats also not the point.You plan for bad behavior or you wind up with this kind of mess in the morning.  Whoever approved the layout or budgeted for upkeep and maintenance clearly learned nothing from the prerenovation Dolores and that really screwed the pooch because I promise its going to cost more to pay an army of rangers to sweep the park twice a day than it would be to simply have more garbage cans installed and pickup frequency increased.The angry neighbors are absolutely going to continue to wage the culture war on partygoers and thats fine thats their prerogative.

7793157,0,t1_d3rtrsy,People inaround SF want more housing built because they want to live in SF and have the houses they can choose from to be affordable. Okay I get that.Problem is twofold  Eventually there wont be any more room for additional housing because San Francisco is hardbordered on  sides. So building more is only a limited solution.  As more housing is built the city will become more and more choked with people at a greater rate than the general dissatisfaction with said choking. But eventually like a rubber band that dissatisfaction will snap back and people will decide to leave the city. And when that happens the price of housing will plummet.So who cares about all that right? Well changes of this nature need to move slowly and work with the market so that snapbacks dont occur. Check out Detroit for a close example of what happens when the city population decides en masse to split. I know thats not everything what happened in Detroit but it is a factor.So San Francisco is super expensive right now. Well that will eventually level out. Really. Just like housing money is a limited resource because eventually companies wont pay high enough salaries for people to live close enough to work at their companies. Obviously this has already started. So what happens is people find other places to live and the house prices in SF level off. Its a market adjustment and its slow. Problem is people dont have any patience and think they can just have what they want right now. Unfortunately life doesnt work that way.To answer your question? SF remains about the same in terms of housing for now. Drive through the city on a weekend day and see how choked it is. Traffic is horrible. Thats a bad thing because as much as cityfolk want to walk and bike around cars will always be necessary in the city. And if people cant get around with cars dissatisfaction rises. People eventually realize SF isnt all that and they decide to move out. Then the housing market adjusts and balance is restored.Its really pretty simple. People just need patience. Theres no cause for all the OMG NEED MOAR HOUSING NOW! As crappy as it sounds people dont need to live in SF. Sure for a lot of them it would be nice but in this world not everyone can have everything they want right when they want it. I imagine the generation causing such a ruckus over the housing market has never really learned that lesson.,sanfrancisco,d3s0btg,-2,t5_2qh3u

7799931,0,t1_d3sogkd,gt We dont need to criminalize homelessness we need to criminalize taking advantage of public space and privatizing it to the detriment of othersRight on. My related question is if the sitlie law is removed and assuming that other city services like  will never respond to incidents involving homeless issues which they dont is there anything that we can do if the various camps encroach on public space to the point where it becomes unusable?I pass numerous encampments on my walk to work and its obvious that the longer an encampment is left in place the larger it becomes to the point where itll make entire areas impassable. For example a tent placed on a sidewalk may initially leave two feet free so that people can pass by it but the chances are that if its left that way for months at a time its inhabitants become bolder to the point where they fill in whatevers left. On a normal sidewalk that leaves no space whatsoever for anyone to get by it and most people will end up navigating around parked cars and into dangerously fast moving lanes of traffic. This isnt an unusual situation given enough time it becomes the rule rather than the exception.If my trip to work becomes blocked completely due to dialed down enforcement do I have any recourse at all?

7854840,0,t1_d3yjnht,gt That is a lot for one club especially a new club.This is true.  The loss on  Washington and Peskins board election were depressing losses.  But with Peskin in particular the loss was smaller than I would have expected given that SF old guard progressives and the Pak machine were both strongly behind him.  A coalition often at odds with each other.The local Siera club leadership challenge was a shocking upset that SFBarf can rightly claim credit for as well as for how close the election was.  Ultimately SFBarf is a singular phenomena and its ability to inject itself into the housing debate after just two years is a major accomplishment  a grassroots initiative to increase the density of SF improve its governance and lower middle class housing costs for new arrivals.  Most of the people involved are actually knowingly activists against their own narrow self interests as most at least those that are residents of SF are either renters under rent control or property owners so theyll either see no benefit themselves of decreased housing costs or will actually see the value of their own property decrease.  Thats certainly true for me.  But Im a huge beneficiary of living in SF financial professionally healthwise culturally socially etc and I want to share the city and that opportunity with as many people as possible.  In addition Im highly offended by the naked selfish nativism by those trying to keep newcomers techies out.Theres still a lot of work to do but its worth while to take stock of the impressive accomplishments made by SFBarf and particularly those of Trauss whos been tireless and evenkeeled even when facing a concerted sustained effort to slime her reputation and misrepresent the policies of the group she founded.,sanfrancisco,d3yydxn,20,t5_2qh3u

I just have to point out that it doesnt take  years to physically construct an apartment. All the problems with this plan reduce to the voters reject it.Did you look at the projection tool? Even if all the government policy factors changed tomorrow you wont get k units with subsequent units being affordable.

Thats about  units of new housing or one AirBnB worth of change for  taxpayer cost better than your option A right?A and D arent mutually exclusive. D will happen regardless of AirBnB legislation.

I mean that if you think cows or pigs are capable of sensation thats even remotely similar to severely handicapped humans then the way factory farms grow these animals often in box cages where they cannot move often never see the sun and quite often start selfmutilating is so shockingly disgusting it should obviously be illegal.For me its not the killing that bothers me so much as the way they are forced to live. So yea while i do my best avoid factory farmed meat and also do try financially support meat from farms that resemble the meaning of the word farm.

Yes I get it  people should act differently than they do. And if you could just somehow convince them that they are doing things incorrectly we shouldnt really need those additional trash cans.

Of course he wasnt the only activist during the civil rights movement.  But theres a reason hes so often cited  he has a strong legacy.  Who are the major BLM organizers?  Alicia Garza Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi may have founded it but the only unified voice in the movement is a hashtag.  Theres nobody to sympathize with when your spokesperson is a hashtag.Second its interesting you cite the Selma to Montgomery march as precedent for what these protestors did because I had that march in mind precisely when I wrote my last post.  They didnt simply shut down the Selma bridge like protestors shut down the highway.  The SCLC together with MLK who was working with President Johnson on the Voting Rights Act deliberately staged peaceful marches to the Alabama capitol with the precise goal of bringing attention to voting discrimination in order to gain public support for the Voting Rights Act.  After being brutally attacked not for blocking the bridge but for marching sparking a public outrage they eventually received federal government protection to continue the march.  Those marches were instrumental in helping President Johnson to sway Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act.

I will cite this again which doesnt come from the LAO report    At the regional level both marketrate and subsidized housing reduce displacement pressures but subsidized housing has over double the impact of marketrate units.

8384950,0,t1_d5pi0o3,street sweepers dont have the ability to impact a childs life like a teacher does.  Im sure you can look back on every teacher you had until the end of high school maybe even college.  ALL of them made an impact on your life positive or negative.  Can you say the same about your trash man or bus driver?  Not disrespecting their jobs but their job doesnt have the same importance on a childs life as the teacher they spend hours with every day.  Youth as you know are the future. if there arent any teachers and SFUSD is in a hiring crisis then who will teach the kids? If the kids become neglected well im sure you can imagine that outcome would be less than ideal.  Teachers in SFUSD are paid way less than other districts in the bay area outside of oakland.  BART operators make way more than teachers.  gt None of my businessNone of your business huh? How can you be so apathetic?  Are you not part of this community now?

8427214,0,t1_d5uwtzn,gt Muni only sucks for people that didnt grow up here.I moved to the Bay from LA in my late teens and thats precisely why I appreciate Muni so much.  Spending your life having to rely on cars to get everywhere and the havoc that it wreaks on the layout and livability of the city is enough to really make you appreciate a system that can get you pretty much anywhere even if it takes  minutes to go a couple of miles on one of the major streets of the city.gt Youre probably gonna hear people talking about using their car or taking Uber. What if you cant afford either?As alluded to downthread taking an Uberpool in many specific cases is worth the cost almost regardless of income.  Laziness and excess income isnt the only reason to take Uberpool  sometimes people need to get somewhere by a certain time with a certain reliability and the cost of not doing so is more than the  dollar gap between Muni and Uberpool for rides that take you halfway across the city.  The price difference becomes more like c if youre splitting it with someone else.  Needing reliability in transportation isnt specific to upperincome people either  if anything theyre less likely to have a job that cares if youre occasionally  minutes late to a shift.  Muni undoubtedly does provide the workhorse backbone of our transportation infrastructure though.  In situations when reliability isnt that important its definitely great to have.Lastly I think the word suck can mean a lot of things.  As mentioned I use Muni constantly and appreciate the crap out of it but I do still think it kinda sucks.  I dont translate that to vitriol at the people who run it because I understand that politics and funding have a lot to do with the quality of transit.  But its not unreasonable for people to get a little frustrated that this amazing infrastructure we have could be run so much better  Ive used a far superior transit system on every other continent except Africa.  Responding to Muni could and should be better with it could be worse is like those people who say the poor have smartphones and new sneakers stop going on about poverty or stop criticizing Americas flaws its already pretty great in these specific ways.  Just because you appreciate Muni as a system doesnt mean you cant want and expect it to be even better and meet its potential more fully,sanfrancisco,d5uxyr8,17,t5_2qh3u

Even if you put the trucks on the bottom. gtUhh the diagram showed  in each direction on top plus  on the lower deck. If they implemented a zipper median like on GG bridge for commute direction you could still have up to  in the direction with heavier traffic at any given time.Ok three lanes in each direction. You realize how bad it is already? gtgtBuild another tube.gtEveryone wants this but it may be the case that boring a tunnel across such a long distance is significantly more expensive. Not arguing against it but I f the cost is prohibitive the bridge solution would still be a net gain.You dont bore a tunnel across the bay thats not how the geology works you drop a tube and found it on the older bay mud or underlying alluvium. Even if less expensive the bridge solution would still seriously fuck with auto traffic. Where does it become a net gain of it costs less and makes traffic on the bridge worse? gtWhy do you assume traffic would be worse with better transit in exchange for  lanes?Because until our regional planning makes it easier to use transit it wouldnt really help much. Youre not going to reduce total demand for auto traffic over the bridge by adding these rail lines. Especially by enough to make up for losing almost half the current capacity which is already way overloaded. As were continually increasing population and need to cross the bay. We need to add transit not cannibalize current options. ,sanfrancisco,d6asplm,0,t5_2qh3u

9177371,0,t1_d8ep9a8,Its possible Muni will one day offer door to door service but youre reducing the number of vehicles on the road you may even increase them. You have ridership who take a bus up  blocks to avoid a hill to a grocery store. Thats not going to change nor should it. You seem to get that but you seem to miss how much wear an tear riding the bus involves for some everyday people. Getting off a bus into a car with groceries or children or your walker all take effort. When unlimited fares came into existence in NYC their ridership boomed and it changes how the population used the service. The results were stretching it beyond what they could handle and theyre still jacking the prices up and scheduling service outages to lines that cut half of Brooklyn for entire weekends. You dont reduce crowds that way. The more that ride it...the more crowded it gets and the more money they lose. We also dont have a clue how much self driving buses cost to operate. I dont think anyone knows whats involved to service them if were replacing drivers with IT or whats involved at this point. gtToday many people wont take the bus because theyre crowded and the transfers take too long.I think youre mistaking you and your friends from the general population. ,sanfrancisco,d8farpb,0,t5_2qh3u

9335968,1,t3_589c6l,Henry Ford once said If I had asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses. Go over Geary not under. Tearing up the street for years would be a five billion dollar nightmare. Id love to see the MISTER overhead pod system instead. A video of the concept is at   mph pods that fly over traffic and stop lights and only stop once theyve reached their destination. Think downtown to Ocean Beach in  minutes. The pods can switch tracks at intersections which means they can go anywhere on a network of tracks. No need to switch to another pod on another line. While one track of MISTER doesnt have the capacity of a subway a wide street like Geary has room for two tracks in each direction and stations could be in the median at sidewalks or both. Being overhead and with lighter pods instead of massive heavy train cars the supports will be smaller lighter and more like installing extralarge traffic signal poles. Even the overbudget Oakland AirportBART connector is . miles and cost  million but has to use larger and more expensive supports than this. The connector is built on what used to be marsh and bay and is designed to withstand earthquakes. Its designed to carry  people per four car train. Assuming roughly  lbs per person including luggage thats  lbs not including the weight of the cars. We can build roller coasters with hills  feet high that withstand earthquakes using steel supports. Those cost  million dollars per mile with all their complicated and custom curving track. MISTER carries lighter loads than the Oakland Connector or roller coasters and should safely and relatively cheaply use steel or smaller reinforced concrete poles. Instead of  Billion per mile like the Central Subway MISTER should be much closer to  Million yet faster and capable of going on any track in the network without stopping.For the price of a subway down Geary at  Billion per mile we could have two MISTER lines on Geary and eight other lines on Broadway California Fulton Noriega Sunset th Divisadero and Van Ness.,sanfrancisco,d8zehjt,-2,t5_2qh3u

There have been studies conducted on this and regardless of race giving your children uniqueunusual names has statistically significant negative outcome.But whats particularly important is that in this case in the case of blacks those who make this poor decision are far more likely to be lower class and have a variety of other negative traits that are correlated with poor outcomes for their offspring and this is indeed what occurs.On average someone with a stereotypically black sounding name will be far more likely to be a risk. Its basic logic.If it was found that redneckstrailer trash whatever comes to mind when you think of the analogous underclass among whites were more likely to give their children certain names for whom the same would apply and a study found that those names were more likely to be discriminated against would that make those who rationally discriminated based on the limited information they have to work with racist against white people?Lets be honest this is largely because these are touchy issues and the majority are absolute pansies when it comes to attempting to have a rational honest discussion about matters that make them uncomfortable and flare up the white and affluent guilt the poor and the sacred brown people.

Then you have some fairly recent arrivals coming in and making a lot of noise and trying to tell everyone how they should run their city.And as things are getting incredibly expensive their answers are all market based answers. Those answers dont provide a lot of assurances that things will get better. They actually provide a lot of uncertainty such as the over building and market crashes you talk about.I can see how that whole experience would be frustrating and destabilizing. Particularly with a huge influx if tech money and if you were here in  it looks like it could just evaporate overnight and a ton of the newer arrivals will just leave. I was in Seattle then but had a somewhat similar experience though less acute. I here it was more crazy here.That said Id like to know how you suggest we encourage developers to build midrange and lower cost housing in the Bay Area?

It does not really affect traffic in the rest of the city except to add to the gridlock during commute time.Also the North Bay train is opening soon.  While that probably will not result in a decrease in the kind of traffic you mention it refutes your claim that there are no plans to change transportation.  The train will at least provide an alternative to people who want to get to cities along the  corridor without driving although currently it will require transferring from BART to a Larkspur ferry.Also studies show that people drive based on capacity so the only way to get less people to drive is to lower capacity of the roads.  The idea that if there were great public transportation driving would decrease is a fallacy disproved by cities like New York which do have great transportation and horrible traffic.The key here is to give the lowest priority to drivers and the highest priority to everyone else.  We only have so much space and so many resources.  We need to invest in sustainability.  ,sanfrancisco,dakrlrr,10,t5_2qh3u

Housing blocs are widely used because even though rents are lower developers are servicing more customers and thus making more money. Its all about scale.However this situation changes once restrictive zoning policies are enacted which cap the supply. In which case building any new structures especially large ones becomes costintensive and doesnt deliver the same gains as a free market would. And as to your specific example Toronto even that is preferable because at least the city there has the physical space to house everyone as opposed to the situation here.,sanfrancisco,dao5vw6,11,t5_2qh3u

Frankly they did win the lottery... most of them paid far less for a house than what its worth now.  Its one hell of an investment.gtIn SF you can have a house a cell phone a car a video game console and still be lower and fixed income. A home isnt the same as home equity.Yes you can have fixed income but massive assets just like our theoretical lottery winner.  A home that can be sold IS home equity with a value of that equity equal to the cost of the home minus the total owed in the mortgage with a bonus in that instead of selling the house you could rent it out for long term high income.Consider that any of the people you describe could should they so desire rent out their house and live very comfortably in Florida for the remainder of their days.

There have been neighborhood test trialsexperiments run over the years to pacify public outcry generally after a major crisis e.g.  or a pronounced localized spike in a particular crime e.g. Purse snatching in fidinorth beach. Police captains running your neighborhood police station set the police patrol priorities. As I recall the argument gets made that there is a better use for cops than walking a beat. The beat stops until something happens and its rinse lather repeat. We simply havent had a mayor nor city council willing to take on the police union drive change down to police station captain level and get neighborhood patrols to include cops walking a beat on a regular basis. Without city political leadership taking on the police union Imo there would have to be sustained community will demanding change. Go to your neighborhood community meeting with your police captain and maybe your councilman in attendance on a weeknight and demand change. Community demands have had some success.

Unfortunately I moved here well after my High School days but I can assure you to be able to go to HS in a major city such as SF would have been a dream for me. There are tons of stuff to do here such as parks lakes surfing paddleboarding biking beaches and hiking. If you have access to a car you there are a lot of great places to go visit around the surrounding areas  Lake Tahoe Big Sur Santa Cruz Napa Muir Woods and so on. The people out here are nice easy going and for the most part intelligent. SF is pretty diverse so people tend to be open minded and accepting. I would suggest being open to your classmates make friends with people who live close to where you will be staying and say yes to things that you are invited to do.Otherwise you will love it here the weather is wonderful and the city is big but not overwhelming. Also our summers are not like normal summers it gets foggy and sometimes chilly in the traditional summer months. We have an Indian Summer which means May  August is cooler and September  October is hotter. ,sanfrancisco,dc04ov0,3,t5_2qh3u

It was not considered a hip area at all. It was a highly affordable place to live and lacked amenities that make a neighborhood a destination.Then with the gay rights movement a much younger crowd of gay people moved into the area and turned it into a vibrant nightlife district and a safe area for gay people to live.Within a short time after that the area had become hip and suddenly property values started to climb. Alongside that family businesses catered to things like upholstery laundromats etc...were replaced with bakeries coffee shops restaurants etc...Today it is one of the more affluent areas of the city.This is a pretty obvious gentrification process. It was poor and not considered hip before and now it is wealthy and considered hip.,sanfrancisco,dc1qcr4,4,t5_2qh3u

Attracted to what is new and obsessed with being first to the newest coolest thing. Often manifested in their pursuit of art and creativity in an effort to be around where the newest things are created.

But of course the actual placement of stops needs to consider where people live and where they are going so theres some wiggle room there.The SFMTA was going to remove that stop reconsidered and put the stop back in so its there.

Yesterday I have a side job in wine pruners were working the vineyard. Normally we just have one full time guy to work the winery and vineyard. But this time of year you need crews to prune.

Just because your car might fit in with a car that could be owned by a local doesnt make it more safe.Also? Dont put your purse in your trunk after you park.

As a moral point people have decided to make sure its harder for a housing shortage to cause people who dont make as much from being displaced.  These laws exist to protect peopleIm sure you know this already but you should be more to the point about this.  You are taking a stand against that morality.  The simple factors of supply and demand have already been weighed in that argument when laws like rent control were passed.  You are saying those people who the law protects are of less importance and do not deserve to be protected from hardship.  ,sanfrancisco,dgdq2km,-5,t5_2qh3u

11630683,0,t1_dgebebm,gt shifting the supply curve literally means lowering the cost of development either through subsidies or removing existing costs like onerous regulations.Im replying to someone saying what solves the problem is reducing market price by increasing market supply.  In the context of affordable housing that posits that we can add enough supply so that the equilibrium price is accessible by those in poverty.  That you also appear to posit theres a way that developers can make money off of that is... fantastical. gt But its simply and factually true that affordable housing increases the shortage of housing by increasing the quantity demanded because its a lower price so more people want to live there and does nothing to drive market rates down.So you think there are free market solutions that can make housing affordable to teachers?  gt  I dont understand what your linked comment adds to your comment here.The comment that I replied to presents an idea  thoughtexperiment that has already been hashed out and shown to be flawed.

The stupidity that antishuttle people and apparently some exshuttle people too fall into is the idea that those shuttle trips will some how go away if shuttles are banned.  What will happen instead is that most of those trips will become car trips adding to the congestion and noise of neighborhood streets both as the contribution of their vehicle and because it will cause SF traffic especially in the feeder streets to continue slow.  The only way getting rid of tech buses could work is if it actually made life so miserable for SF residents that they moved or changed jobs.
