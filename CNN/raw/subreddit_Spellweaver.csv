4137446,0,t1_crrvmi7,I dont know it would still be good to unlock all regions because then if youre not able to play for  days or so you can come back to the game with all the regions filled with quests.Why in particular are you trying to get a closed beta pack for each aspect?  If its just to give them a try then I understand   Just be aware you wont get to keep those cards when Open beta comes.,Spellweaver,crrvynq,1,t5_37cn1

6611040,0,t3_468bv0,I think the main reason is that its just too easy to build a very good Dominion deck its cards have immediate value and most are very good and new players will naturally go towards that. Ive seen a lot of interesting nondominion decks but it requires a deeper understanding of the game and deckbuilding in general and more cards too.,Spellweaver,d034ya8,2,t5_37cn1

6789965,0,t3_48rr35,I think there are multiple reasons   The first would probably be because control decks take longer to win games with sometimes that you would be able to get less games in then an aggro deck would   Secondly it maybe possible for you to just get a friend and get them to queue up hope you get against them and they just surrender   Not sure if these are the reasons why but this is what I would guess so,Spellweaver,d0lxiqf,1,t5_37cn1

8338361,0,t1_d5jo00i,Im pretty sure it was an emotional overreaction on the devs part caused by some of the pretty cancerous threads that have popped up in the last weeks. That and it was probably mainly that you posted your concerns in the hype thread and not in the secret card discussion thread.Still Im on your side on this.,Spellweaver,d5jul9p,3,t5_37cn1
8397940,0,t3_4un7lf,Well as someone who averages  wins apparently th on the leaderboard right now I can tell you that Trials is frustrating but not really for the reasons youre talking about. Trials is frustrating because it seems like its a big open format with a lot of choice usually the great thing about limited formats but if you want to win consistently you actually have a very small amount of possible options for what to pick how to play etc.If you want to win more and overcome your personal frustration you probably just need to better figure out how youre supposed to pick and play. For starters you listed off a bunch of purple bombs that you had Dreyna Karthus Helm and Cataclysm. You know none of these are even the best purple card Mutant is. Now Im not saying you made a mistake by picking them because you couldnt have picked Mutant over them anyway but small things like understanding this will help you immensely. And those bombs arent even that close if I had to assign a numerical value to cards in Trials in Spellweaver with Sanctum being a  and Mutant being probably a . the highest of those that you listed would probably be something like a ..,Spellweaver,d5raf8n,2,t5_37cn1

8681392,0,t3_4yvun1,Spellweaver has been around in testing versions for awhile but has not received much real promotion where as Duelyst has spent some money paying some big named streamers early on and put more effort into promotion over all.Spellweaver needs work on its new player experience such as the tutorial and coming single player campaign so that the game is more accessible to new players and they are not initially turned off by what they perceive as complicated mechanics because they are not explained or demonstrated well. In the end we can only hope that the quality of the actual game will give it its proper due and win out over hype and other superficial external factors.,Spellweaver,d6qsr7r,5,t5_37cn1
8698863,0,t1_d6swxfl,Maybe the perspective is different for you and me because when i open packs right now there is no difference between new and old. Also just from the experience I had today in Spellweaver I invested  hours of time and I got   packs from a quest  starter pack from a level up and enough gold to nearly buy a third pack. I played alot of hearthstone in the past but I never felt rewarded as much as in Spellweaver and Duelyst. ,Spellweaver,d6szn05,1,t5_37cn1
10424006,0,t3_5p84en,Yeah its definitely not going well. Its sad to see even if I havent been playing the game for several months. I enjoyed many of the concepts behind Spellweaver but with the direction of recent changes to the game I realised that their vision for the game is fundamentally opposed to what I wanted to see. Im continuing to keep an eye on the game to see if they eventually change direction but I wouldnt bet on it happening before it sinks.,Spellweaver,dcpmp0j,4,t5_37cn1
10752468,0,t3_5tu4uo,As a new player coming from Hearthstone its been so refreshing these past couple weeks playing this new card game. For the future of the game all I can say is they just added  cards everyone can get their first copy for free this week by doing PvE challenges some of them seem good. The meta of a lot of one turn win decks seems to be staying though at least the ones I face. Edit typo,Spellweaver,ddp19ew,6,t5_37cn1
