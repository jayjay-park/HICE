2234606,0,t1_clnvcrs,Because it wouldnt be the same as what it was especially after it has been annexed by a country not as stableimportance which could hinder trade. Also considering you where just at war with Turkey your finances would be absolutely drained. War is expensive and you havent quite done anything to help your economy. This is how you get crises the more you go to war and the more you annex Especially in the Middle East where tensions between cultures are very high without doing anything to make your country better EXCEPT the war and annexing. ,Futureworldpowers,clnvelz,1,t5_33ohi
