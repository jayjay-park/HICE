But I think I just got lucky.I purchased him about two weeks ago and he quickly consumed my copepod pop. in my g. which I figured he would. I would introduce more copepods at night about  times a week someone local sells copepods which he breeds for a fair price. Even at this rate he was getting skinnier and skinnier with no sign of improvement. I would attempt to spot feed him and hed just scutter away. I would feed a mixture of brine mysis bloodworms baby brine and daphnia. Nothing. Every feeding Id watch intently and then after two weeks he ate one brine shrimp. I knew not to get excited because it doesnt mean hes completely comfortable with frozen food yet.He didnt go for any more.BUT the next night he just wouldnt stop eating!! He mostly goes for brine and a little of mysis. He seems to have no interest in bloodworms. I cant tell if he goes for the baby brine or daphnia. TLDR I think I got lucky,ReefTank,cfxxz6v,6,t5_2smmh

I had a g up for about  months before moving it and it was a pain to do.  is obviously less but it still is a lot of work. The more stuff you put into it the more work it will be.

729109,0,t1_cgmnkoy,gt I would try not to move them around that much and stay on top of your tank parameters and you should be fine.Pretty great advice for coral in general. Most corals will adjust to new circumstances and moving them around constantly will stress them out more than letting them settle in. A chalice coral will just grow a thicker skeleton to adjust for high flow. Corals can adjust the amount of zooxthalae to compensate for light. Several types of corals are exposed to air and straight sun during low tides and survive. Corals are a lot tougher than we give them credit for and letting them settle in is probably in their best interest longterm than finding the perfect spot.,ReefTank,cgn5j37,1,t5_2smmh

802992,0,t3_22lkfv,Fellow chemist here. Youre good. I ran some analysis of my live aragonite sand and got pretty similar results. The phosphorus will cause an extremely small algae bloom and protists will eat the silica. Nothing else is worth mentioning. Having different crystal structures of calcium carbonate means nothing in our context. If youre interested in some chemistry keep reading. Otherwise enjoy your new found peace of mind. Your tank will have a high concentration of calcium ideally ppm and about a x higher concentration of magnesium ideally  ppm. As Im sure you know this means that the calcium will be limited to a one way street where it can dissolve in but the magnesium will prevent the calcium from precipitating. This is wonderful for us because it means that our sand can help maintain calcium levels when our coral use up calcium. Of course you will be doing periodic water changes to provide the bulk of the calcium but this can provide a little extra stability. Just like in chemistry stability is the name of the game when it comes to a healthy reef and a happy reefer. If you have any questions feel free to ask or pm me. ,ReefTank,cgvjxwh,1,t5_2smmh

What you can do is have your main tank overflow into the brute trash can then the brute overflows into the sump and the sump has the return pump back to your main tank.You can use a uniseal on the brute tank for the overflow. You will want to make sure you balance things out in your design because if you turn off your return pump you want to make sure the tank sump and brute dont overflow. Its not difficult to do its just like sizing out a return pump chamber but now you need to size the brute trash cans overflow so you dont overflow your sump.,ReefTank,chtgmbu,3,t5_2smmh

1526163,0,t3_2bp81s,How many pounds of live rock do you plan on buying? If its a good amount I would suggest going to WalMart or target and getting a storage container thick enough to hold water and big enough to hold all your rock. Then put the heater and power head in there along with the rock after you fill it with saltwater. If you have your protein skimmer already for your tank throw that in there as well it will help cycle the rock faster. And every couple weeks or so do a water change on the container. You can tell the live rock is cured by smell because you wont be able to smell anything when you sniff the rock if it smells like dead fish its not ready haha. If you dont wish to smell rocks just get simple saltwater test strips and check the nitrates and nitrites they should be close to zero if not zero when the rock is fully cured!

To give something of an update my LFS gave me some iodine based coral disinfectant so I have dipped it for  days in this so far. I was finding that when I was lifting it out to dip the polyps were retreating and the brown jelly was being taken in with it. Therefore on the second day I added it to my hospital tank and waited for the polyps to extend before I dosed with the Iodine. Unfortunately this has probably nuked my hospital tank. The good news is that after the second dosing the coral is looking a lot happier and the brown jelly has dramatically receded to only have a few little bits left which grew overnight. I am going to continue dosing until I see it disappear. Ive lost about  of my coral but the  thats left is looking great. Perhaps its possible to win this thing.  ,ReefTank,cmvkd27,2,t5_2smmh

Ive never had any type of algae bloom besides the initial diatoms when starting the tank with store bought ocean water thanks Florida and another diatom bloom when I moved the tank. I do however stay on top of my water changes which are done with store bought ocean water. Phosphates stay virtually undetectable. Nitrates stay low around . And my tank is overstocked. Currently its a  bow with sump. Id say at least  of live rock. No skimmer. No fuge. Just a filter sock and chemipure blue in the sump. And another hob running carbon filter pads. Inhabitants are a pair of false percs cardinal royal gramma rusty angel foxface and a niger trigger that is the biggest sweetheart you could ever imagine. Clean up crew is huge.

Even a couple sps frags are doing ok its only been a month. Rose Millie is morphing to green which means it needs more light. Red digi looks good. Idk how or why. It just works.

They can be rather aggressive. Ive had one kill a flame angel and Id bet that theres a good chance it will take out your wrasses. The flame angel can also be aggressive as well as the hog fish. A lot of things are hit or miss in this hobby in regards to fish temperament but its usually best to err on the side of caution.If I were you and stocking a g I would put the clowns the flame angel and a handful of damselschromis. Start there and see how everything goes. Also if youve never had clowns before they can be extremely boring fish. Watching clowns in the tank really can be like watching paint dry.

Pick up a good box cutter one of the ones with the long snap off blades. And a box of blades. Put painters tape on the outside of the glass matching up with the trim slightly up under it if you can extend the blade and very carefully with it through the silicone. You may need to make a few shallow passes until you are deep enough you will feel it when you are bottomed out on the plastic. Very very carefully work your way around the tank trying to keep the blade flat against the glass. After that from the inside do the same sort of thing but get the blade between the trim and the top of the glass.

4820565,0,t1_cu23u4c,Thank you for recommending dry rock! Keep in mind sand is not a necessity and CAN be an extra cost and headache. I would start with a barebottom and maintain the water quality you like and add sand if you really like the aesthetic later. In a reef tank we are keeping water more than we are keeping livestock. By that i mean keeping the water parameters stable is what keeps the livestock alive and well. With water quality on spot the organisms adapt and grow like they have evolved to do. With all of this in mind sand can be a detritus trap and usually an experienced reefer will handle it better i started with sand and now run barebottomTo me the benefits of a barebottom outweigh the aesthetics of a sandbed. Detritus builds in any system and can become trapped in various parts of the system. With sand it may be trapped and release nutrients over many weeks. With a bare bottom reef the detritus is a visible reminder that you need to suck it out with a water change. Sorry i got off topic of the post im just a strong advocate to starting very clean and simple and adding complex systems later. Starting with quality water is the MOST important part of any system. The water should be RODI in order to reduce algae problems. If you are adding nutrients from the water water changes wont be of much help. With a small tank it might be more economical to buy RODI from your LFS local fish storeThe biocubes are a great start as far as i hear but remember it is acrylic and will scratch VERY easily. You can find a used one on craigslist fairly regularly. This is probably the best post i can recommend. Geoff the writer is highly respected and has been in the hobby for decades.

5022945,0,t3_3jpsq0,I wouldnt buy these lights based on the fact that all the LED bulbs in them are Daylight bulbs and all of them under K if I read correctly. Coral grows best under higher Kelvin rated lights ranging from K to K. Honestly you could still grow things like Pulsing Xenia and mushrooms under these lights simply because these corals are pretty low light and easier to keep than some household plants.Id recommend the Chinese Blackbox LED lights found on eBay. I personally own the W Wifi capable one and I have to say its actually not bad. I have a birds nest and a bunch of softies growing perfectly fine under it and I would highly recommend them for soft corals and low light hard corals. ,ReefTank,curgfpt,1,t5_2smmh

5198585,0,t1_cvclhz0,Thank you for your reply. I definitely like your idea of putting the new sand in then adding the old sand on top since my old sand might still have beneficial bacteria even after rinsing. Furthermore I think this will help prevent trapping bad nutrients at the base of my tank under new sand. I have one vote to not rinse the sand and everyone else suggests rinsing the sand and I agree. Im going to rinse the hell out of it.The general consensus is to let the new tank run and cycle for a bit and to take my time with transferring the tank and I agree. I think it will be more beneficial for the fish and a lot less stress for me. The only reason I wanted to transfer in a day was because I was sharing some equipment but I think I will have enough to cycle the tank without compromising the inhabited tank. Looking at the old tank I see  distinct stages I can do this in. First stage will take half of my LR rubble in my sump and then  of the LR at a single time with a week in between. Cheaper return pumps are coming with the new set up so I will have everything I need for the new tank except for a protein skimmer which like you said I can go without for a little while and not have my aquarium implode and heaters I will still have to buy those.As far as the protein skimmer I plan on loading this thing up eventually but since I have a child on the way it will probably take me years financially to do so I am definitely sticking with the protein skimmer I have for now. When I get a larger bioload and notice a rise in nitrates I will just add another skimmer or buy a new larger one.gtDegree in chemical engineering.

You can grab a brand new JBJ  gallon AIO for about  there are plenty of upgrades that are available. Six pounds of live rock would be like  depending on your LFS and a ten pound bag of live sand will run you about . Bam brand new tank for under .I bet the lights arent strong enough for corals and hes just feeding the duncan fish food so it looks beautiful and that candy cane is on its way out. And that rock looks like its been in a tank thats poorly maintained. I say just spend a little more cash and start out right. Youll be able to upgrade the tank in the future if you start getting towards higherlight requiring corals such as SPS or clams. Plus then youll have a tank and equipment with warranties if anything goes wrong. As for the extra maintenance equipment all you need is a magfloat not entirely necessary a refractometer a little costly but WAY better than a hydrometer  or  five gallon buckets like  each a siphon hose and a battery driven bubbler the kind they sell at walmart for keeping fish alive in bait buckets. Also the best thing you can do is read books about saltwater tanks. The best advice I could give is regular water changes usually fix most algae issues which is the hardest thing in this hobby. And quarantine your fish! Its not that big of a deal if you have a small tank with only two fish in it but when you get a larger tank and you probably will youll regret introducing that one fish that kills  of your other fish you have invested hundreds of dollars in.

You will want to write a REST API so your web app can communicate with the arduino. Adafruit has a tutorial here Let me know if you have any more questions.

6714463,0,t3_47gu8t,Best cure for GHA is localized application of Hydrogen Peroxide H.   Pull the rock out and put a few drips of H on the hair algae allow it to bubble for  seconds or so then either rinse or place the rock directly back in the tank.  Its best to do this mid day during lights on.   Youll have to spot treat slowly as to not cause a large nutrient release but I gaurantee that the H will kill the algae without causing serious harm to the coral. Sensitive Coral to H include Xenia Pipe organ waving hand.  Mushrooms are affected to a much lesser extent.   Killing the algae will of course release the nutrients into the water column while youre nuking the green it is important to keep up your nutrient export Skimming GFO and possibly double up on water changes. ,ReefTank,d0du04s,2,t5_2smmh

7218073,0,t3_4ebfr4,Oh man you are in for a learning experience. In a couple of ways. The reality is that you have a shit situation. Its not a beginner fish and it will need a tank far far far larger tank than what you have. You said you have the fish for several weeks but your tank is only  weeks old? On top of everything you should be quarantining every new fish in a separate system for minimum  weeks. Your fish most likely has ich. Most angels from stores will. Its not an immediate death sentence but it is a ticking time bomb. The parasite is in your water now and getting rid of it is tricky. So now even if you bring in new healthy fish they will have a big chance of contracting the parasite. Its possible that everything will be fine and out of nowhere you can get a severe outbreak several monthsyears down the line. I would suggest reading up on quarantine procedures. Most effective treatments for ich will not work in an aquarium with invertebrates so the fish must be moved to an invertfree tank for treatment. Then the parasites in the original aquarium need several weeks months to starve to death without their hosts. ,ReefTank,d1yn0rj,2,t5_2smmh

8478891,0,t3_4v5hv1,yes has more surface area but typically louder because of the way it moves the balls it all depends on what you want? what size have you got allocated to filtration? if this is set up in your fuge you wont be able to grow algae or anything for nutrient suppression also forgot to say you typically need quite a lot of money for the initial investment but after that depending on the substrate and how often it needs replacing it is basically free or very cheapEDIT realized im not really being that helpful so see below.What would i use? i would use a moving bed but confine it to bioreactors for quieter operation. yes this give lower filtration capacity this also frees up your fuge for macro algae growth and somewhere to move problem fish or grow live something like small inverts for feeding.Advantages to moving bed self cleaning almost because the balls knock off the old bacteria but yes this means your skimmer should be after the moving bed. Efficient and simple to setup and maintain.Disadvantages to moving bed loud like really loud. Expensive initial setup. Great if you have a tank crash because you can literally nuke the bacteria with bleach to kill anything or everything then rinse to remove the chlorine. Require a lot of space to tumble typically i would not fill more than a third to a half of the chamber with bioballs else they dont tumble and therefore old bacteria and detritus build up in it. Like most filter types they still need mechanical filtration techniques.,ReefTank,d61ek2r,1,t5_2smmh

I installed a fan over the sump and an AC in the room so now the tank doesnt have daily  swings but over the course of a week it will see temps in that range. Then I went on vacation. I had a scooter blenny and to get him enough to eat you had to put in a bunch of pellets. I had my housemate feed the tank while gone and he took this to an extreme. Needless to say I came back to a nitrate problem mgL. I have since removed the scooter.Panicked I did serial  gallon water changes and also dosed vodka. It worked and my nitrate levels have been stable at the level reported. But still the Duncan remains closed. ,ReefTank,d7mzcvy,1,t5_2smmh

9156697,0,t3_55n999,So I said I would say why I believe my nano has been easier and really more successful for me than my bigger tanks. I could not understand....why did I never get algae in my  gallon? Why were my corals happier? Why did I never get wonky test results? I was using the same amount of water for the water changes in the nano as I did the  and . Really no kidding. I just didnt realize it. I do weekly water changes and I guess my mentality at the time was..oh if I change water WEEKLY I dont have to change as much. And this is essentially true. But I wasnt changing enough in the bigger tanks to accommodate the difference in livestock. So I was changing  weekly in the  gallon and only  or less weekly in the other larger tanks. Seems so obvious. I know. Then I decided to make all things equal  per week per tank and my algae issues are fading into the past. So.....IMO the secret to success in nano tanks and probably all tanks is........frequent water changes. The important minerals are replenished that way and nutrients are diluted. It has really been that simple for me. ,ReefTank,d8coelg,1,t5_2smmh

But some of the prices are just plain old stupid if you ask me. But if you were to spend stupidly I feel the mushroom will have the best chance of living long enough to feel like you didnt get burnt. And to be honest the people that look at my tank are just impressed that everything is alive and not a artificial decoration You get the same response from a  coral as you would a  coral. As far as equipment I wont lie lol Im pretty much a Ecotech and Apex spokesperson I spent a lot of money on those and feel they were worth the money. I believe Apex is an insurance policy for the tank and its very high quality over all. And I selected all Ecotech products because of the location of my tanks. They are on either side of my TV and you see them as soon as you walk in to my house I have zero wires inside my tank.

9398014,0,t3_594v1z,Making money long term is tough to do. For about  years I used to sell frags out of my basement in the mid s. I was able to make about  a month doing this. My corals were all acropora and montipora frags. But basically you need to have good mother colonies that are a decent size not these little frags that people are calling mother colonies. The colony should be able to provide at least  good cuttings a month. Have at least  corals that people really want and set up frag tanks so you put clippings in one section and then next month put clippings in a different section. Do that for a few months till you have a decent supply then start selling frags from your oldest section that section should be your sell area. But only sell corals from your sell area and every month move over more corals into your sell area. The idea is to have corals being rotated through the frag tanks all the time. This keeps you with a good supply of frags at all times. Peoples biggest mistake when selling frags is they tend to run out having extra always on hand helps out with shipping problems as well DOA corals you can easily replace. ,ReefTank,d979iv8,2,t5_2smmh

10398981,0,t3_5ovw5h,wow pretty setup!  MY suggtestions for a move of a tank this size are  premake some water at home.  Buy some brute cans fill em up with RO and salt them now so they will be ready.  Maybe you dont need them in the end but worth having them on hand on move day should you end up short.   I would say to make up at least  gallons of salt water ahead of time for spillage and well it doesnt hurt.  if you got  brutes you could go up to about  gallons..  Move as much of the water as you can!  This is a bigger tank i would recommend a full size truck or a rental truck uhaul?.  You are talking about over lbs and I think most trucks are rated at  or  ton so you will be maxing out a trucks bed load capacity... likely best to rent.  You want to try and do this all in one shot!  dont want to have to go back and forth this guy wants his tank gone so he will want you gone with it too   Get as many smaller containers  gallon buckets as you can afford.  You should put corals in the buckets so they dont get overcrowded.. they will slosh around and you will get some free fragging so try to keep acros with acros and LPS alone and softies with softies.. put the fish in these buckets too but try to just get one fish in each or maybe a few but dont try to put all fish in one bucket.  fill each bucket to about  gallons so you dont loose water sloshing around moving to your truck.  fill them first with the cleanest water from the top of the tank siphon off fill all the buckets with a few gallons first before you touch any rock the rock WILL cloud of the water with detritus when you move them so you want to get as much of that CLEAN water in the buckets and containers first but remember to leave some room for the corals and rocks.Get a few bigger storage bins as well so you can move the rest of the water and the rock that doesnt have any coral attached.  or even better more brute cans.  you really cannot have enough of them   I own  ... they have come in so handy over the years..  It may sound odd to move all the water but this will help with the shock of the move.  its one LESS thing to stress your fish and corals.  once you get it established at home do some larger water changes over a few weeks to make it yours.  Ive moved a few big tanks this size and you can get it moved and setup in one day if you plan it all out.  I suggest getting to their house as early as they will allow you need the WHOLE day.  My last tank takeover  gallon I went to the guys house at pm and we worked until am when I finally had everything in the tank at my house situated enough that I felt I could take a break and get some rest so plan on a good hr day.   We couldnt fit it all in his truck so I used his truck my truck and my wifes car to be able to move it all in one shot.  There was a lot of dry goods and other stuff in the deal so yeah lots of space used for this move   When you get to your house clean the tank when its dry and you have it outside.  put it on your driveway or whatever and wash it out well and scrape down the glass as good as you can you want it as close to looking new as you can get it will be much harder to clean it later.  any rock that looks less than perfect you can give a scrub with a brush and even a blast with a hose to wash off any algae doesnt look like that will be an issue for you.  I would highly suggest not making many if any changes to how the tank is plumbed and configured.  You will have time to do all that later for now you just want to get it moved and setup with as little stress to the fish and corals as possible.    Have you current owner describe to you in great detail any special things you should know  to open the hood you have to flip this latch whistle  times and stomp on the floor twice.  think of it like buying a used car they all have their own peculiarities.  its ok you bought it you just need to know what to do to make it a success.  if you dont have an RODI unit order one RIGHT NOW and get those trash cans filling up with water!  A gpd unit is really going to take  hrs to fill those  trash cans so you have some water ready and waiting for your big day!  Plan to spend a few hundred on buckets and brutes.  if you dont have an RO unit and salt thats another few hundred.  plus the truck rental cost. might cost you  or so to do this move.  dont be scared away by that number just be aware! its better to know now than find out later and have forgotten something that will end up being the fail of the move.  sorry to ramble on hope that helps. and really seriously  GOOD LUCK please tell us how the move went in a few weeks!,ReefTank,dcmshl5,3,t5_2smmh

10749233,0,t3_5tqjx1,I dont think there is anything wrong with the canister  as long as you keep it clean. Its a great place to run carbon and mechanical filtration. Dont listen to people who call them nitrate factories  the canister filter isnt generating any nitrates but like anything on the tank that is not cleaned or maintained it just collects detritus. If you dont run the canister  then where is that mechanical filtration happening? Its collecting on the rocks or somewhere and Id rather clean a canister filter than have to blow off and clean the sand more often.,ReefTank,ddop919,2,t5_2smmh
10757520,0,t1_ddpjv4x,They are both horrible recommendations for a reef in . You dont need either. Filtration can be achieved with much better options. It isnt that nitrate is released it is that all that debris rots. If you are OCD about getting it out then maybe it wont have time to. But almost no one cleans their filter that much. And even if they did they could save a ton of time with other methods such as a skimmer and refugium combo. More people have problems with DSBs which is why so few use them and when they have problems they are much worse and can be more sudden than other methods. Naming anything that can theoretically go wrong doesnt make DSBs any better. The frequencies of these issues are a major factor and reason to avoid DSBs altogether. ,ReefTank,ddpk3if,1,t5_2smmh
10766651,0,t3_5tzszn,Heres what Id do. Pick up an Aqueon  gallon a Hagen Aquaclear  small heater air pump air stone thermometer and Seachem ammonia alert badge. Theres your new QT system which will handle pretty much every treatment and will be enough room for any juvenile fish that would be appropriate for a g gallon tank. In terms of medications if youre going to QT you should do it completely its really an all or nothing decision. Im not sure how expensive things are in the states but youre probably looking at another  in things like Hikari PraziPro Flukes Mardel Coppersafe chelated copper Ich Velvet Brook  API copper test kit  Seachem Cuprisorb AcriflavineMS dip for immediate ichvelvetbrook relief and Seachem Kanaplex general antibiotic. Theres also others that can take the place of some things like Chloroquine phosphate instead of copper for most fish.I dont want to scare you but again its really an all or nothing aspect to the hobby. It also is a long process realistically  weeks as you transition from LFS acclimation and feeding adjustment to proactive treatment then finally observation stages. I would really head over to reefreef and look up the threads on quarantine copper  chloroquine phosphate use and the fish diseases post its really the best forum these days for general information. If you dont want to go through all that at the very least Id pick up the tank and equipment and use it for an acclimation  observation tank for  weeks. Let the fish destress from transit get accustomed to whatever youre going to be feeding and see if anything visually crops up. Good luck,ReefTank,ddqi0rz,1,t5_2smmh

11542579,0,t1_dg4az4n,our tanks deal with a ton of nitrate every day my tank stays at  nitrate even though its overstocked with fish this minuscule amount wont affect anything. Water changes will still be removing nitrates.,ReefTank,dg4cpxd,2,t5_2smmh

11613712,0,t3_65l9c1,Chances are if you need to finance anything in the aquarium hobby you cant afford it. This is yet another unfortunate example of how this hobby can lead to disaster when people will spend money on a new price of equipment instead of the electric bill.,ReefTank,dgcfa2t,1,t5_2smmh

11713479,0,t1_dgnpiag,If you cant appreciate successes big or small just keep it to yourself. You dont have to rain on everyones parade and nit pick about their exact wording just move on. There was even fair warning in the title when I said Sorry to Brag so if you have such issues with that exact type of post you shouldnt have clicked on it in the first place. Of course its unsolicited no one asks Hey anyone add new clowns this week and have them immediately start actively participating in the act of being hosted?. This forum is full of my clown wont host I cant get rid of this algae whats wrong with my x Obviously a lot of people like to see the good stuff too. I am sorry you cant just enjoy something simple. ,ReefTank,dgnr382,7,t5_2smmh
