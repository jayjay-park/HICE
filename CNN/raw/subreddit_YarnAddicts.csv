371160,0,t3_1ya8a8,I just got a yarn catalog the other day and I said it was like a nudie magazine minus the centerfold. This would be the centerfold. Haha.,YarnAddicts,cfj8icq,6,t5_2t1hd
387387,0,t3_1yicxq,The way I spinPinch a few inches above my hook. Give the spindle a quick spin. Park it by placing the stick between my thighs and take my time drafting and getting the yarn I want. Twist this fresh yarn onto spindle. Then repeat. ,YarnAddicts,cfkx2kx,2,t5_2t1hd

752639,0,t1_cgpl0dl,Thanks for the response! I will probably message the seller about folding if I start to seriously consider it. It wouldnt be a deal breaker if it didnt fold but it would be nice! I will have to do some research on the ratios but since Im just starting I dont mind using whatever ratios I can get.,YarnAddicts,cgpty4a,1,t5_2t1hd

1138159,0,t1_chxmbb8,Oh good call! The yarn we sell is boxed up separately but thats a good point. My husband and I are really allergic to scents as well among other things! and Id be pretty unhappy if I were allergic to yarn!,YarnAddicts,chxnjeo,2,t5_2t1hd
1355792,0,t1_cim0ubh,I live in city no access to sheep or roving. And roving is really expensive around here because no one but one farm in Alabama is local that I have heard about. I am sure there is a local group somewhere but I havent heard about them. ,YarnAddicts,cim8mgv,1,t5_2t1hd

2044852,0,t1_ckzq689,Cheers. Was hoping there was some way round it since they brought it me to make them socks with. I might have a go dying up some yarn in the same colours  theyll never notice the difference!,YarnAddicts,ckzqv2k,2,t5_2t1hd

2329123,0,t3_2lz7l2,I just typed out a whole thing and then I deleted it so Im going to try againI dont like that you list two different yarn bases as one posting. I would buy your yarn to make socks but I dont want  Merino for socks. The  nylon is a much better match for socks but I want to be  sure what Im ordering. If I were you I would split the listing so each colorway and yarn base combo is a separate listing. Also your product explanations are a bit wordy. I would cut it down a bit. I had to look a while before I found the size of the yarn. Also your store just hasnt been around that long. I also do not buy from European stores because the shipping is so high. Hope that helps!,YarnAddicts,clzlcav,9,t5_2t1hd
2575994,0,t1_cmunruq,I understand what you are saying I just wasnt very literate when I first woke up and posted that. It was meant to be more along the lines of you might get more mushrooms out of it in the future rather than this is how you should do it. ,YarnAddicts,cmutjyi,2,t5_2t1hd
2611067,0,t1_cmzda89,I presoaked my yarn in vinegar and water ratio of  cup vinegar to four cups water then added it to the beet juice which was from  regular sized beets. ,YarnAddicts,cmzejpt,2,t5_2t1hd

3060892,0,t3_2v7tqh,Probably because the dye was set with vinegar!  Citric acid can be used but some swear by vinegar the smell will wash away,YarnAddicts,cof9bby,3,t5_2t1hd

5706992,0,t3_3t6zl6,Pre drafting helps but dont over draft so much the weight of the spindle rips it apart. Go slow and be forgiving to yourself. ,YarnAddicts,cx4iaov,3,t5_2t1hd
5920714,0,t1_cxvq7za,Both I guess! As it is i find it quite unappealing. But the fiber is lovely. Its  wool Border Leicester. I guess could try to dye it black... Not sure what to do with it. Many thanks for the recommendation!,YarnAddicts,cxvqjif,1,t5_2t1hd

6644817,0,t1_d06ai6w,Thanks very much for your suggestions! Im going to get a big plastic tub for my yarn in the future with a snappy lid. Our cats here are male too.  I got a lot of the yarn from a friend who has female cats so I wonder if thats not related to the pee problem... ,YarnAddicts,d06mr2m,2,t5_2t1hd

7079755,0,t1_d1irkac,Yes this has been my biggest issue all of the spam. It is especially worrisome when theyve claimed to have read all of these articles and pages including ones that people have linked them and done all of this research and then turn around and ask how much vinegar should I use? Really? And then a majority of the questions become extremely subjective and vague with little to no specifics given. Theres not much I can really tell you from guesswork other then youre going to have to do your own guesswork.I was thinking the dyeing sub needs a stickyed stickied ....sticky post specifically dedicated to quickish questions and answers. Or something along that line.And seriously experience is the best teacher we can definitely get one started but some things one as to learn on their own.,YarnAddicts,d1iuskq,11,t5_2t1hd

9513585,0,t1_d9lph3b,I think they just assume makers wont charge them for labor just supplies. Still supplies can be incredibly expensive and your time spent making is worth far more than the supplies. Time is the most expensive thing we have because we cant get more of it. Its a limited commodity and people dont get that.,YarnAddicts,d9lr357,1,t5_2t1hd

10380351,0,t1_dcko3m1,My mom owns an animal rescue so Ive taken care of many bunnies  however I would rather get a young rabbit from a breeder since taming older bunnies does intimidate me and I know my limits. Im an amateur spinner so I was thinking a German angora. Supposedly its uncommon to brush them all that often since you shave them for the wool about every  months and theyre bred not to matt.  But I will look into more breeds of fiber bunnies now that you mention it just to be sure. ,YarnAddicts,dckodqh,2,t5_2t1hd
