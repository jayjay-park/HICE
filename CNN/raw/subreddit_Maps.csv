4860915,0,t3_3hgoez,I would suggest starting with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data for elevations they are low resolution when compared to Landsat but for a globe they will work. They have images of entire continents in GeoTiff format which should import well to your GIS.Hope this helps!Quick edit Heres a link to the South America GeoTiff file I am using for my researchIf this isnt what you were looking for let me know here or in PM a little more specifically I minored in GIS at university and I have a pretty good idea of sources for free data.,Maps,cu796y1,1,t5_2qiwh

More hedge funds are domiciled in the Caymans than any other place so that would make sense.The original website of the graphic is an Auto Title Loan service that you can pawn your car to if you need quick cash.
