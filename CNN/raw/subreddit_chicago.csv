The public should charge for use of that space or we should return it to productive use.  hr seems like a bargain to me.  Rule of thumb anyplace worth spending time its hard to park.  Show me a place where its easy to park and Ill show you a place that sucks to live.  Like a condo by the highway in Schaumburg or Houston.As for nothing gets done what doesnt get done?  Whenever Ive need a public service its been pretty good.  And there are a lot of public services.  An example of something awesome that was rolled out ontime and for little cost and that works freaking amazingly is Divvy.  That seems to be the way things usually go.  The South Red Line rehab that was just completed came in ontime and underbudget.  The weather isnt for everyone especially if you hate a having a couple cold months.  I like the weather better in the Pacific Northwest and San Fran for sure.  I think Id like the weather better in Sydney.  Beyond that though I dont have much to complain about.  Like parking if the best thing about a place is the weather it probably isnt a very nice place.  Bostons weather is identical to Chicagos and I like Boston fine.  New York citys weather is degrees warmer on average in January.  OK I guess.  Its about the same.  Id love to live in Montreal or Toronto and the winters are far harsher there.

321414,0,t3_1xq5ds,The thing that bugs me the most about the CTA is the system itself. I have absolutely no respect for their operation. As far as I am concerned it is managed completely incompetently. I admit that they keep the trains running most of the time even in really bad weather but thats really part of a pattern of doing the bare minimum to avoid political embarrassment.My ride on the brown line each morning is exactly . miles. With all the waiting for signal clearances and slow speeds in between those periods of waiting at a standstill it takes about  minutes on a good day. Thats less than mph. It should be going more than twice as fast. If the loop doesnt have the capacity they should change the design of the loop. Also the timetable is  useless. Some citys trains are accurate to  seconds of their schedule. Chicagos train schedules bear so little on when the trains will actually arrive that I have given up on using them entirely. The trains can come a few minutes early to a few minutes late or sometimes seemingly not come at all. I take the purple line express home. Towards the end of the evening its only scheduled every  minutes. It would be so nice to be able to time my walking to the station so that I am there exactly when the train is scheduled to be there and I spend a minimum amount of time standing in  temperatures. Cant happen. I would have to get there  minutes early to make sure I didnt miss it and then it could easily be  minutes late and then after a couple nights where it just never came and I had to take the brown line all the way around the loop in the wrong direction I gave up on looking at the schedule.Also would it be so expensive to enclose and heatAC some of the busier stations and transfer stations?Also why do the seats have that cloth material on them? Every other city uses something thats easier to wipe down.Also how would you rate the CTA station employees as ambassadors for visitors to chicago? Throughout europe people in that position wear uniforms with ties and are trained to provide directions and advice to tourists.Also what is the deal with the placement of the train tracker displays? They are never where they need to be. They have one at Wellington station... downstairs so you cant see it from the platform. They have one on each side at Quincy... but it only displays times for the trains coming on that one side and considering youre in the loop a lot of people are considering going around either way and are trying to figure out which will be faster. Plus the train tracker display on the southbound side has been dead for weeks. Some stations dont have them at all.Also would it be that much more expensive for the stations to not look like they would feel at home in a refugee camp?,chicago,cfe328n,3,t5_2qh2t

Aldermen have been lobbied. Yet the city appears to be going forward with a proposal to allow people to get paid to give rides to others in their private cars. We will not stand for this.

550343,0,t1_cg2jn4m,Yes so the point on regulationsinsurance is valid and will absolutely impact their supply base pricing availability.  However I am accounting for that.  Their solution is simply better.  I used to have to go out on the street and hope to god that a cab was there.  Sometimes I would wait forever and miss flights be late for meetings dinners etc.  Even if the pricing turns out to be comparable after regulations kick in Ill still take it.  They built a better mousetrap.And by the way I know many folks at Uber cant speak to Lyft or Sidecar this is a very deliberate strategy to build massive customer acquisition before they ever have to deal with regulations.  The reason they are doing this is so that if cities do lash out and try to kill it there will be massive pushback from citizens.  That is and always has been the best way to deal with this type of progress and powerful lobbies.So no I dont think they will lose.

To them Chicago is a dystopic carnival a combination of rickety thrill rides and all manner of strange sideshow freaks. So long as Chicago doesnt get too noisy its mostly an example of moral decay used as an object lesson or a Gomorrahlite to be visited when its time to misbehave a little.Who needs whom is a pretty simple question we all do better when we get along but when push comes to shove the rural folks can feed themselves the city folks cant.

So you really need to tax the rd of the people who pay taxes another  per year.  For someone earning k a year this would be a  income tax hike.I dont think thats going to fly.  What you really need is a massive tax hike on people who earn over k.  But thats probably  of the population and someone earning k already pays  in state income taxes.  So youd need to collect another k from these people to get a billion a year.  And at that point places like Texas look pretty damned attractive.  IL is already uncompetitive in taxes as it is.  I was at SXSW in Austin a while back.  Seems like every fifth person I ran into was a recent Chicago transplant.  And these were people under  who likely werent paying  in income tax to IL. Edit  The deficits are that high.  From the report I linkedaccording to the report by the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois Fiscal Futures Project... projected budget gap of  billion in  growing over the next  years to  billion.The states own projections disagree with those published in the report. The report foresees a  billion deficit in the states general funds for  while the state budget office projects the  billion budget will show only a . billion deficit.Im inclined to not trust the state since they have been wrong every single time they have published a forecast.

1258429,0,t3_28i922,Hey fellow redditors!A few years ago when my friend Eliza and I were in acting school at Illinois State University we read the play Bachelorette by Leslye Headland and fell in love. We were struck by the honesty of its characters and their relationships to one another. Specifically the complex qualities of female friendship. It had everything we loved. Humor heartbreak and more than a few badass strong complex roles for women. We feel the story that it tells is one that speaks to the modern twentysomething woman a story that is rarely told with such brutal honesty. A couple years later as roommates in Chicago we decided that we didnt want to wait any longer to do something we were passionate about. We were tired of waiting around for someone else to provide us with the opportunity we wanted so we decided to take matters into our own hands.

Where is the evidence that cyclists are such a destructive force? When all is said and done youre right its their property and they can essentially do what they want and not do what they dont want. I just think it reflects poorly to see people act this way over something that is really a rather minor. It may just be jealousy at the bottom of all this.

The fact those companies feel their profitsvia Chantix and etc. are threatened by ecigs are probably why these companies pressure major regular antismoking groups behind the scenes to press for including ecigs in outdoor bans despite that theres no logic for thator IMO also even regular cigs.

1984582,0,t1_cksbemm,Using a Chicago cab will cost you around .  They charge the metered fare plus an additional  of the metered fare past the Chicago border.  In practice many cab drivers will try to charge you an extra  of the whole fare.Unless money is no object call a suburban cab company to pick you up.  For example the American Taxi rate from the loop to Wheaton is  plus tip tolls and fuel surcharge.   I dont know if they will have any cabs available in the loop at  am.  Maybe you should call a few suburban taxi companies in advance.Note that the first train back to Wheaton is at  am Monday  Friday and  am weekends on the UPW.  On Saturday there is a BNSF train at  which you could take to Downers Grove and take a taxi from there.  Note that neither Union Station nor Ogilvie are open  hours so youd have to find someplace to kill time until the first train.,chicago,cksccdg,7,t5_2qh2t

2151638,0,t3_2jmprd,One thing I like to do to cut through the bullshit at election time is read the business press. Business media unlike other media has a minimum requirement to report objective fact on matters of commerce otherwise its businessowning readership will dry up.That doesnt mean the business press wont bullshit on matters of pure politics or labor or social issues but it does mean that at its core business media has to be somewhat accurate when counting money and reporting on transactions.This page sums up Bruce Rauners biggest problem for me.  Its all business press reporting on how Rauner made a personal fortune managing Illinois pension money.  The reason this is a dealkiller for me because Rauner is running explicitly on the idea that government doesnt know how to manage its pension funds.  This is monumentally hypocritical because government picked him to run pension funds and he took millions and millions in fees while pension funds were left struggling.When pension crises are used as a bludgeon to claim government is broke then the people who got rich managing the pensions reach for that bludgeon thats when I know Im being lied to.,chicago,cldblo0,8,t5_2qh2t

They have the money to do it and they know theyre a safer alternative  Its just not cost effective to buy new ones.  It is better for their investors if they pay the fines and settle lawsuits.

2302062,0,t1_clw7x9t,Whats wrong with TIFs? Where to begin? First the entire TIF program as currently run is a perversion of the original intent of the law to help blighted areas. Have you seen some of these blighted TIF areas? Central LaSalle Street? Some of the richest property in the world. Does LaSalle Street look blighted to you? Look at map link below they are heavily concentrated downtown and in and around the downtown. Second TIFs divert half a BILLION of tax dollars annually. Now maybe you believe in free money or fairy dust but as Joravsky correctly contends that money has to be made up by the rest of us property tax payers.  The nature of property tax is the governments requirements is levied on the tax base. Once you take out the TIF money the rest of us get levied a little harder. Governments needs dont go down because some of their money is siphoned off into a special TIF slush fund. Money that governments dont collect because the TIFs have diverted it has to be paid by the rest of us. Heres a think tank which believes the TIFs are directly responsible for the governments pension crisis. According to the report TIFs may have contributed to underfunded pensions because as the City made inadequate contributions to pensions its loss of property tax revenue to TIF more than doubled from  to  and quadrupled by  to more than  billion per year.Its hard to ignore the evidence that TIF impacted pensions TIF costs grew general fund revenues declined and the City addressed its budget gap in part by making inadequate contributions to public pensions according to Cafcas.Third the TIFs in the wrong place are used to fund developments for rich developers for developments that would or should happen anyway. Or theyre used by Mayors as christmas presents to build new schools somewhere but meanwhile rob the schools of the operating funds to staff and run the school. Merry Xmas! Heres a map that shows  percent of ALL Chicago is in a TIF siphoning off  million a year of our tax dollars. And you tell me if those areas look all that blighted. Its a joke.More info Since  TIFs have siphoned off  billion. How different do the City pensions the CPS system and the funding of these governments if that money had been in the governments coffers instead of a Mayoral slush fund for cronies and corporate donors? Fourth in NY and other places where real estate has increased in value property taxes were actually CUT over the years because revenue increased so much. Here not so much. Fifth the DePaul TIF will actually reduce tax revenue forever because it is taxing taxable property and turning it into nontaxable public property. The McHugh site was going to be used as a data center and generate a couple million annually in property taxes. Now we taxpayers get to make that up and that site will never pay taxes again. That is exactly opposite of what TIFs are supposed to do. If you want to learn about TIFS nobody has done a better job at covering this abortion than Ben Joravsky at the Reader.

2441907,0,t1_cmdhmsv,Some really good places to start! If you dont mind I am going to send you all of the city. The big museums are the Museums of Science and Industry It will be an all day thing if you go. It is in the Hyde Park neighborhood which is a little bit of a ride down but there are many of buses that will drop you off right outside the doors.The Chicago History Museum is in Lincoln Park at the tail end of well the actual Lincoln Park Park. It is mostly dedicated to the local history of Chicago and you can go through it in a few hours.Of course there is the Museum Campus area. The Field Museum Adler Planetarium and Shedd Aquarium are there. Personally I have never been but they are top institutions. Lastly for museums there are several smaller museums through out Chicago. One is the Driehaus Museum which  is a Progressive Era mansions that has been preserved. Artwise I cannot recommend much. The Art Institute of Chicago of course but other than that...For Jazz go up to the Green Mill in Uptown. It is wonderfully old school and has hosted a lot of Jazz greats. Remember Uptown can be a little shady. You should be fine in this area but take a cab home.Kingston Mines is a favorite local spot for Blues music. The Vic in Lakeview hosts alternate and indie bands. When you get to Chicago pick up a Chicago Reader. It is a free paper from any yellow newsstands. There will be a section on concerts in Chicago and what band is playing what venue. They also have a website Chicago has a couple theater districts and theaters companies scattered all over the city. There is the Downtown Theater District and Belmont Theater District Also look at Steppenwolf Theatre Company Again the Chicago Reader should list what is playing and give reviews.Aw food. Here is my long list Calos the Bongo Room breakfast the Fountainhead Sheffields beer garden Blaze Pizza Cheesies amazing grilled cheese Ann Sathers breakfast Dryhop Brewing Crisps amazing chicken Smoque BBQ Troys Turkish Peqouds Pizza the only Chicagostyle pizza you should be having The Weiner Circle hot dogs  the service is purposefully rude and DO NOT order a chocolate shake Taco Joint Cafe Bah Bah Reeba Kumas Burger DMK Burger Au Cheval Burger  long long wait Big Star Revolution Brewing Hopleaf beer Beermiscious beer cafe Piece Pizza and Brewery. There are all over Chicago none really by your hotel and are not even close to the amazing places to eat and drink but its a good start. Subreddits for Chicago food and Chicago beer are listed at the side and are good resources. I would suggest taking the CTA whenever possible and reserving taxis for the night time. Each neighborhood I have included are generally safe but big cities do have crime. As long as you are smart you should not have to worry. From what I have seen in major bar areas muggings tend to happen to the substantially drunk. If you are this dont walk hail a cab.,chicago,cmdiw20,2,t5_2qh2t

Wouldnt it be wrong to walk around shouting inaccurate information?Here is a link. One link. Feel free to do your own research the NPR article on the grand jury outcome is very good. And since you might not click the link... Here. Witness  told the grand jury that he was outside while working a job on Canfield Drive when two men later identified as Mike Brown and Dorian Johnson walked by him. He then was able to see the events in question with a direct line of sight. Witness  saw the struggle in Wilsons police car  with Brown confronting Wilson inside the carI just see Mr. Brown inside the police officers window.  It appeared as though some sort of confrontation was taking place. That took place for seconds Im not sure how long.  And one shot the first shot was let loose and after the first shot Mike Brown came out of the window and took off running. So my initial thought was that wow did I just witness this young guy kill a police officer grand jury testimony Vol.  page  line  hereafter cited by just page and line number.Witness  elaborated about Browns position Half of his body his feet was still planted on the ground his upper body was inside the window in a leaning motion inside the window his upper body was inside . And while the witness could not hear what was being said inside the car it just looked out of the norm with somebody being leaned over inside the police officers car . Witness  then explained that after the firing of a shot Michael Brown and his friend took off down Canfield Drive. Officer Wilson remained in his car briefly and then pursued with his gun drawn  but not firing at Brown . Eventually Brown stopped.According to Witness  Brown then turned and ran full charge toward WilsonHe Mike Brown stopped.  He did turn he did some sort of body gesture Im not sure what it was but I know it was a body gesture. And I could say for sure he never put his hands up after he did his body gesture he ran towards the officer full charge. The officer fired several shots at him and to give an estimate I would say roughly around five to six shots was fired at Mike Brown. Mike Brown was still coming towards the office and at this point Im thinking wow is this officer missing Mike Brown at this close of a range. Mike Brown continuously came forward in the charging motion and at some point at one point he started to slow down and he came to a stop.  And when he stopped thats when the officer ceased fire and when he ceased fired Mike Brown started to charge once more at him. When he charged once more the officer returned fire with I would say give an estimate of three to four shots. And thats when Mike Brown finally collapsed. .With regard to the body gesture Witness  explained All I know is it was not in a surrendering motion of Im surrendering putting my hands up or anything Im not sure.  If it was like a shoulder shrug or him pulling his pants up Im not sure.  I really dont want to speculate ,chicago,cmmomqy,1,t5_2qh2t

2694813,0,t1_cna4313,Youre correct the pier is nearly desolate well before midnight.  Only folks outside are individuals soaking in the skyline photo opportunists smokers and people taking cell phone calls.Oh and that reminds me  the foot traffic before midnight.  If youre walking indoors and enter from the main area before the IMAX theater you can soon expect elbowtoelbow foot traffic.  This will be prevalent way before midnight since there will still be toddlers running about baby strollers people who suddenly stop and typical crowd confusion.  This isnt aided by the fact that the stores carts and kiosks are still open crowds  business.Once you pass the souvenir stands and some of the food establishments the bottleneck crowds dissipate and foot traffic is more efficient.  To save time with any of that do empower yourself to use the various glass doors for exitentry.  Some will be locked but many remain open.  Youll still be able to get a good rail view of the fireworks around  or so.  For a splendid view you can certainly go the distance and congregate on the upper level where the Ferris Wheel is located or down on the boardwalk by the lake.Upon exiting you have the option of the boardwalk the interior concourse or cut through the exit garage and walk on the northern point where there is a narrow footpath by the lake.  That would shave some minutes from your time unless you drove anyway and walking isnt a concern.  With the latter option for the love of all things fluffy please watch out for vehicles.   The north part of the pier is poorly illuminated and nobody wants an accident.Anyway your girlfriend wants to see this so I personally think she will enjoy it.  Since youll be with her certainly I dont see the need of either one of you rushing out.  And if either one of you are into the cliche Instagram or Facebook midnight updates the fireworks make a good update to friends and loved ones who are also massposting.

Lots of Chicagoans register their cars to outofstate or suburban addresses parents friends PO box whatever and skip on paying the city sticker. Ill leave it to you to decide whether thats moral or not but its a thing. Supposedly the city is going to crackdown on the practice.Last summer my wife was borrowing her parents car with Ohio plates and made an illegal right turn. She got pulled over and the cops kept on asking her if the car was supposed to be registered in ChicagoIllinois my wifes DL is Illinois and she kept on saying No this is my dads car. He lives in Ohio hence the Ohio plates. Eventually the cops dropped the subject and let her off without a ticket. I would recommend that you get everything transferred but Ill confess that I drove a car with outofstate plates in Chicago for seven years and never bought the stickers and never got ticketed for it though Ive received lots of tickets for other things.

It creates artificial displacement and neighborhood migration that wouldve happened more organically if not for these situations. Pull your head out of your ass and think about the larger picture.

I had to pay my rent check that day which involved traveling to the area of Western amp Fullerton. I managed to get there only riding the th bus and the western avenue bus. I remember standing out at rd amp western for like  minutes until a bus finally came. When I got there i put my rent check in his mailbox and found a liquor store where i got a small bottle of whiskey for a party that I was invited to at the edgewater beach. I got on the fullerton bus pretty quickly and took that to the red line which I took to bryn mawr. My friend jevon was waiting for party goers at the starbucks next to the station but I was the only person who showed up. We left the starbucks and battled against these mph winds until we finally got to the beach. When we got there we just stood there being beaten down by the strong push of the storm. We left after  minutes and I got a call from work that nobody from the suburbs could drive in for the night shift. So I took the red line down to harrison walked to work at polk amp wells and stayed there until about am when my replacement arrived. I still had the bottle of whiskey in my pocket so i pulled it out started rinking it and ended up walking straight down halsted street from harrison all the way to st. I had to walk in the street because the sidewalks were covered in several feet of snow. It didnt matter though as there wasnt any traffic.

3126788,0,t3_2vyuc0,Argonne National Lab is in Lemont IL. The only public transit out there is the Metra BNSF Line. If you were determined to live in the city youd have to live in either the Loop University Village or Pilsen of which the Loop is the heart of downtown and the other two are fine neighborhoods but not where most transplants want to move to. This will still put your commute at about . hours each way as after you get off the Metra station after a  min ride in the suburbs you need to walktake a bus for another  mins. This is assuming you live immediately next to Metra station and dont have a significant walkbus ride to it. There are several very nice suburbs along the BNSF line which would cut down your commute time. But then youd be stuck in the burbs and NEED a car there. If you are desperate to live in the happening parts of the city and still dont want to get a car your commute will be over  hours long and miserable. Even if you get a car and want to live in these areas your commute will be miserable but less so. My suggestion is to get a car anyway and move somewhere near the Stevenson expressway. My friend works at Argonne and lives on the north side. He is constantly looking for new jobs because he is stubborn and refuses to leave Lincoln Park. My two cents.Edit just noticed that this is an internship. Dont waste your money on a car. Just find a cheap apartment somewhere in Lemont near the labs and ride a bicycle or take a bus. Youll only be there a few months anyway.,chicago,com38yk,34,t5_2qh2t

So if youre just a minute late for your train you have to wait  minutes for the next one.    Its really a matter of personal preference. Would you rather avoid dealing with the headache of traffic and parking? Or would you hate how much longer it would take via transit and the risk of missing your train and being stuck downtown for an extra hour? You could always try it out now do a test run.

The money you are giving away for free parking is taking the place of something else unless there is a spot for  people to park downtown that Im not aware of. If you replace buildings with parking lots you are getting rid of businesses already succeeding in the most expensive area of town paying good wages etc. and replacing it with jobs that pay almost nothing along with decreasing the economy around that area as shown in every other place than Vegas.You want to be like Vegas not AC Mississippi or any of the other areas who tried to be Vegas and failed. Ok how do you guarantee great weather  days a year? How do you make it so the casinos are the only thing to do without destroying the surrounding area economically? How do you find the land including your free parking since you obviously drive?A casino would be fun because I like to gamble but public policy shouldnt be driven by my few hobbies and how I want to get there. They are a terrible idea and all youve said so far is that Vegas is great all cities with casinos have done well and you want free parking and drinks. ,chicago,cplbktc,1,t5_2qh2t

3486867,0,t3_306z06,Having often stayed in DC for extended periods for work over decades eg residential hotels and been a life long Chicagoan for even more heres my take.  Assuming youd live in the actual City each case.  And assuming youd live in a young person district.  Ratio of self absorbed A Holes to normal people much higher in DC  Ratio of people not from here about even if you are living in a young trendy area  Ratio of good weather nod to Chicago in winter a real winter.  Even scores in Spring and Fall and nod to DC in summer except August.  Cost  depends on what you want because both can deliver from snooty to trashy.  You can mugged on the door step both places. Commuting  depends on where you live and where you work.  If you are on a Metro line at both ends DC is better for the ride but not the reliability.  If light rail doesnt perfectly line up so you have to bus Chicagos the hands down winner.  Taking another job since the job for which youll move is not your deciding factor depends on what you are good at compared to the local job market.

If you hit the car in front of you bc they stopped at the red light its your fault for following too close. Driving is a privilege not a right. It is not mentioned in any amendment in the constitution. I understand the argument that the cameras were thinly sold as safety devices but are obviously revenue makers.  Also that the yellow lights are too short that needs to change and I think it is. Well if you drive dangerous then you should pay for your behavior. You can look like it as a premium for the ability to drive faster. Also IMO and experience its better to get a ticket in the mail than have to deal with a cop in person at the scene.You can beat the system just drive safely! I live in the city have been hitclose calls several times and sold my car years ago so I see both sides but drivers have an easy remedy by driving the speed limit and not following too close. ,chicago,cpqvgfw,6,t5_2qh2t

My company is trying to get everyone to return to the office I lucked out because they dont have the office space here but one of my coworkers is being pressured to drive  miles each way simply so she can be onsite at a remote office.

The city needs some solution for efficient NS public transit west of the red line. Were not going to get another L line anytime soon so I think BRT is our best bet.

3559633,0,t1_cpy0k6u,Also for those curious like meA Still Alarm is the basic structure fire response protocol of the Chicago Fire Department. The term Still Alarm came about upon the advent of telephones becoming more prevalent in reporting emergencies. The alarm offices register that received the signals from the actual fireboxes would remain still when someone reported a fire or emergency via telephone. The Still amp Box is either transmitted by companies upon arrival at the scene when needed or due to multiple reports or confirmation of a fire. If there is a confirmed fire the Still amp Box Assignment may be added to the Still or HighRise Still assignment upon request of the ranking officer on the scene. The Rapid Intervention Team R.I.T. Response is sent when the Still becomes a working fire or upon request. The Mayday Assignment is used when firefighters operating on the scene of any emergency become lost trapped or are discovered to be missing.

A Box Alarm is the standard protocol response for fire alarm activations in a hospital nursing home theater or other potentially high risk structure. If the fire is reported to have persons trapped or the Fire Alarm Office receives numerous calls for the same location then a Still amp Box Alarm is automatically transmitted by Fire Alarm Office.Source,chicago,cpy0uju,6,t5_2qh2t

My lb apparentlyediblelooking CorgiChihuahua mix is one of those. When I was looking at boarding our guy I was going to go with Rockstar Pets Ended up not doing it because I was able to take tiny dude with me. I put a few hours of research into it. I used to take the pup to Tucker Pups for grooming and I hear their boarding is also topnotch. Theres also  where a dogsitter will come into your home and hang out with your dude or take furdude into the sitters home for about as much as most boarding programs. This is probably going to be my choice for our guy when wedding season hits in a month or two  its a less stressful version of boarding for very attachedanxious dogs and Ive heard rave reviews from friends who have used the service. Just be sure you shop around for your specific person if you do this and make sure theyre aware that he might have some doggie issues.

3706903,0,t1_cqes29c,gtA decedents suicide does not make any contextual allegations more plausible even those allegations where we want to find ethical failure.Thats untrue when the conflict is between business partners. In business costs are spent by a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit that catalogs a long list of charges. These charges are in fact made more plausible first by the spending of that cost and second when the decedent decides on suicide rather than fighting particularly when a low cost of settling the lawsuit is apparent which it was here.The huge differences with Aaron are that in his case a state prosecutor was leveraging the situation to further her career by kicking a hacker done without any personal cost to herself.  She was not acting to recover monies invested and profits promised as with the business partner in the lawsuit. In short the partner has to pay to sue but she never had to pay anything. Also Aaron had no comparable option to settle nor any comparable low cost to resolve the action against him.Im really not here to judge the decedent but to notice the allegations in the lawsuit are plausible and made even more so by their being banal and very common in entrepreneurial business. Despotism sexual hijinks on the job broken partner covenants and shady bookkeeping are utterly rampant in entrepreneurial business. The courts are deluged with fights over money such as these they are indicative of a cultural inclination in the way we create enterprises and the costs to participants are sometimes immense such as with suicide.,chicago,cqet947,1,t5_2qh2t

But if the diversity of the neighborhood safety and a quiet neighborhood feel appeals to you go for it!       But if youre interested in living in a hip area around a bunch of people your age for something similar in budget check out Logan Square Avondale or maybe Rogers ParkEdgewater anything walking distance to an L stop. Those are more common neighborhoods for the younger crowd on a budget. ,chicago,cqjah05,1,t5_2qh2t

Sure you can get mugged downtown but you could also not get mugged in Austin but that doesnt mean that Austin is a better neighborhood than the loop. Personally I would never live in the loop because I think its ridiculously overpriced and you dont get your moneys worth. I dont think paying k to live in a closet is a good use of resources but whatever floats your boat.I live in a highrise in Lakeview and I feel extremely safe. I have qualms about high rises in general because of all the rules but would never live in a top or a smaller building. I like the amenities of my building and I am lucky that I live within a pretty good vicinity of grocery stores. Commuting is more challenging...I mean honestly I cant do public transportation because it almost always takes me like twice as long and I get really sick on the bus.

3926688,0,t3_35eevp,Reading a lot of these comments has been a bit frustrating to say the least because incorrect terminology is being used and then if you take that terminology to a LT clinic you might confuse people. First him not paying utilities to you is irrelevant in re eviction. That is a likely oral contractual matter. You want that resolved? Go to court or settle. Second this has nothing to do with squatters rights. He is not a squatter. He hashad a right to be in possession. That right may or may not be now terminated. That doesnt make him a squatter. Do not bring up any bit of squatters rights or adverse possession issues to the clinic. You might confuse an intern and no one wants that. Three it isnt crazy that you cant just kick him out. You wrote a nice paragraph on reddit. You may know or think that he does not belong or will not belong in possession of the land. We dont know that a cop doesnt know that and the state doesnt know that. It isnt like he just walked into the apartment and you called . To prove he no longer belongs you have to go through the eviction process. It might suck but in the long run it is a better process. Four you havent discussed what type of lease you have between you and the sublettor. That matters. In sum contact a LT clinic or a lawyer or the what not.

Most of Bronzeville sqmi PArts of Hyde park Ohare Sandburg TerraceMuch of the near north The entire expressway system etc. Its no insignificant portion of the city honestly. Im not saying its enough to worry about but it is legitimately a significant amount of landproperties that have been forcibly taken over the course of this towns history. But  the city has to pay market value so even as a home owner being eminent domained out of their home you get compensated appropriately for it so you should generally be able to afford somewhere comparable within the same neighborhood. And while Eminent domain has been used a ton in Chicago history I dont see it as likely to be used so much in the future.

4179324,0,t1_crvsxnf,Complying with the law is easy as fuck dont mix the security deposit in with your own money.  Its the tenants money youre just holding it. Disclose to the tenant in writing where the security deposit is. If you sell the building to someone else either give the tenant back the deposit or disclose to the tenant who you are transferring the deposit to. If there is a problem at the end of the lease give the tenant an itemized list of the deductions youre making from the security deposit within  days of them moving out with paid receipts for repairs. Pay the tenant a few bucks a year in interest on their deposit.Thats basically it.  If youre going to take on the responsibility of making money by providing housing for people and you cant comply with that you shouldnt be doing business of any type really.Security deposits are on the way out because landlords have been monkeying with them for years the incentive is pretty strong when you have two rental units total and you have a thousand dollars of the tenants money in your pocket that youd love to hold on to and it provides an easy hook for lawyers to start a case with if youre fucking over your tenant in various ways.,chicago,crwnbo7,3,t5_2qh2t

If youre from a small town the transition might be rough it was for me but itll pass I promise.I cant help you with anything car related but Chicago Transit Authority is your friend. I used to take it for granted and get annoyed with any delays but its better than not having one at all. Take some time to get familiar with the transit system and if there are any good apps with schedules and delays its a great thing to have.Practice basic safety at night. Most of the city is fine but its a different environment than say Bowling Green. Try to stay in well lit areas if youre out early in the AM be aware of your surroundings etc.Winter is going to come sooner and be colder than it is in KY invest in a good coat and boots before then. Summer and early fall are going to be hot but dry so much less humidity and WAY less bugs.It took me a while to get acclimated and find friends but if you google ltthing youre interested ingt ltneighborhood andor Chicagogt youre bound to find something.

These storms form in environments where at least some amount of Convective Available Potential Energy CAPE is present but very low levels of wind shear and helicity The lifting source which is a crucial factor in thunderstorm development is usually the result of uneven heating of the surface though they can be induced by weather fronts and other lowlevel boundaries associated with wind convergence The energy needed for these storms to form comes in the form of insolation or solar radiation. Airmass thunderstorms do not move quickly last no longer than an hour and have the threats of lightning as well as showery light moderate or heavy rainfall.

4370970,0,t1_csht9nd,The general belief is that teaching is a noble profession. While I generally agree with that sentiment it doesnt mean we should throw giant piles of money at teachers without thinking about the consequences for the taxpayer. My ex worked as a teacher and there are plenty of them that are as shitty and lazy as the average employee in any private company. I think its this moral highground argument that CTU trots out that makes me dislike the union more than anything. I have a friend who became a CPS teacher and he wears CTU shirts and sweatshirts and talks about it constantly and I just cant stand to be around this guy anymore. Its the complete lack of humility or sense of responsibility for the citysstates fiscal disaster that makes me have a generally negative opinion of the CTU rather than my opinion of teaching as a profession.

At least two were extremely late and I think I saw one go behind the buildings without it open. Im assuming guy behind the building was the one in critical shape and a buddy was trying to get to him.News story online said the guy looked unconscious and in the hospital had a brain bleed. I assume an epidural hematoma.I dont know anything about skydiving but all in all my theory is that the guy took a leg to the head mid air which knocked him out. Chute popped on its own. Brain bleed either from mid air collision or hitting the ground.Edit Looked at some photos I took. Definitely looks like a guy chased him. Dont have any shots of the guy disappearing behind the building but have a few of a guy over the same building way lower than everyone else with his chute out after other guy disappears.,chicago,cu4d3ek,4,t5_2qh2t

Even planes just flying through the airspace are separated by  feet depending on which direction they are flying.Additionally its a requirement now for all commercial aircraft to have TCAS traffic collision and avoidance system which alerts pilots if they are getting too close to another aircraft and allows for preventative evasive action. Flying really is the safest form of transportation there is. ,chicago,cuodhtm,4,t5_2qh2t

5058065,0,t3_3k8abl, I took a horrible uber ride over the weekend with a pretty dim driver.  She obviously had no idea where the heck she was going and was trying to blindly follow her GPS as Im saying Armitage.  Turnaround and take Armitage East. .  Then I had to explain to her that in countriesplaces on a higher latitude they have more daylight in the summertime and barely any sunlight in the wintertime.  Take Sweden or Alaska for example.  THEN she proceeds to tell me about how on her last day of driving Uber she wants to put on a Rastafarian hat green yellow red black with fake dreads a Jamaican flag hanging in her car and blast reggae music because her customers would have a great time.  I was like Yea! Yea! You should totally do that! with subtle sarcasm.  The...worst. Why does Jerrys Sandwich Shop have Rap Karaoke on Fridays?  That blew my mind.  My super nice Hispanic neighbors have been throwing these dope fiestas once a month in the back alleys.  Last weekend they had one of those gigantic inflatable castles. I finally got over my anxiety of riding a bike in the city.  Even though its just to the L before amp after work and to the gym and back...its good start. BE CAREFUL coming out of the Trader Joes parking garage on Clybourn.  Its super tight squeeze for traffic and theres this wall that gets lower and lower in height on the right side until you cant see it anymore and its deceptively out of your field of vision.  An old lady was coming in I was turning right and was not aware that this little edge of the wall was still next to my car.  Scratched up that lower part below my right side back passenger door that piece of metal below the door.  Ugh.  Another thing in life!

5094093,0,t3_3ks0a7,Like others have said how often this happens is very hard to say. Ive lived in the city my whole life and never had anything like this happen and Ive lived in some not great neighborhoods. The only thing close to this I had happen was Im pretty sure just a roommate forgetting they left the backdoor open and thought someone had broke in. Police did take a while to show up but were pretty helpful when they arrived and searched the apartment for us. Nothing was taken so thats why Im pretty sure someone just left a door open. But because my other roommates were still freaked out I put up some home security stickers and beware of dog signs. Not sure how much of a deterrent they are but they helped my roommates feel better. I personally am not comfortable in an apartment with burglar windows because Id be worried about fires. Does your apartment have motion sensor lights installed? Might want to get those.

5105475,0,t1_cv17kwp,Pretty much this.Dont know about system since I wasnt at the front...but especially at festivals there is always a stream of people retreating from the front during the first few songs.  Theyve never been to a big festival show that includes everyone from Anthrax fans to reggaeheads.  When the pushing starts the realize they arent ready for it and bail.  And honestly I dont mind being in the middle of the pushing...I dont know exactly how the pushing starts but its kind of fun to just let go and let yourself get moved around by the crowd as it surges back and forth.  Also I think there are more dicks at festivals who think they can be hardcore and join the mosh pit or whatever but they dont know the rules.  They dont know that if somebody goes down you stop and pick them the fuck up.  If you stoop to tie your shoe around seasoned punk concertgoers people are going to spread their arms and make a little hole in the crowd so you dont get trampled if the band starts playing again before you finish.

5105633,0,t3_3ks0a7,Lots of people are jumping on the Get a Gun bandwagon here but Im going to say if possible for your current situation Get a Dog.The dog will by no means be perfect but if a thief is going to break in and has the choice between a place with a dog and one without Id imagine theyll go for the one without. The dog may not be an attach dog or go nuts which is good but its highly unlikely that an unknown person trying to enter your home will alert your dog who will in turn alert you by barking or making noise. I know I can barely roll over in bed without my dog hearing me from the other side of my apartment.Plus youll get a lifelong companion and get to go to one of the greatest places in Chicago the Montrose Dog Beach.Regarding the gun I totally understand the desire for one but Id be worried more about a cop doing a noknock and getting shot than a thief. Maybe its selection bias in the media but I hear about the former much more than the latter and the former means youre basically fucked with legal battles for however long your savings can last.TLDR Dogs are to prevent thieves guns are to stop them after theyve already violated your home.,chicago,cv1f3rl,3,t5_2qh2t

5142683,0,t1_cv5vc7w,I agree ereading has something to do with it too but I think that can be overstated.  I just checked Amazons top best sellers list.  Saga Vol.  a great series is around .  For any comic book to be in Amazons top list is significant.  People are still buying print media comics theyre just doing it where its cheaper.  I personally try to mix up purchases from Amazon with purchases from local shops because I think theres intrinsic value in supporting the local shops.  But I know plenty of people who dont think that way.  If they can save  or  off an order theyll do it online regardless of things like culture and community and discovery.P.S. There are lots of things that you just cannot get by ordering from Amazon.  If you want to get those local artists new books you have to go into a comic shop.  If you want to be able to shoot the bull with oldschool comic book guys and girls and get interesting recommendations and find new titles based on your conversation you have to go into a comic shop.  If you want to just have the visceral experience of wandering through aisles full of interesting material and curious objects you have to go into a comic shop.  And of course if you want to participate in a local comicoriented event you have to go into a comic shop.  So there are lots of reasons why comic book stores are still relevant in .  But for many people those reasons dont outweigh the reason of but its  off on Amazon.,chicago,cv5vvnp,1,t5_2qh2t

5257782,0,t3_3n0jev,I will preface this by saying that Im not from Chicago originally.I disagree. This is one of the largest cities in the wealthiest country on the planet and it traces its very existence to global immigration. It played a vital role in expanding American industry and influence across the continent and world. Chicago also played a pivotal role in the Labor movement Haymarket Affair resulting in workers rights that much of the world enjoys today. The German author might also be surprised to learn that this city was largely developed by emigrants from his own country! Perhaps we could do more to advertise ourselves to regular people abroad but we are more than a blip on the radar in terms of the global economy.  One could make the same point about Berlin. Most people including me know almost nothing about the city other than the fact that it is the capitol of Germany and there was a wall dividing it once.edit link on German immigration and Chicago,chicago,cvjr1f0,19,t5_2qh2t

I hear from my family out in Iowa that many of the public assistance populations of Chicago are moving out there supported by some reports I have read of Chicago losing slightly more poor populations in exchange for middle and upper class populations moving in for an overall loss. With such a low cost of living they can live a far better life. God you can buy entire fucking mansions for k or less. My cousin owns a gorgeous old large farmhouse and cant even sell it for k.And given the sparse population spread out a lot seriously the house I was born in you could not see your neighbors house you cant really develop a culturesociety of violence.Ive long felt that the solution to this crisis would be to spread families far apart. Even mixed income housing wouldnt be the best solution. You have to break the sociological values of the area and get them in a place where existing sociological values are more in line with the rest of the country. That is schooling taking care of your property etc. Cant really do that when your neighbor is carving out the wall behind your fridge to steal your food. Or the teachers in schools dont deal with school violence nor should they really that shit will get you stabbedWhen we lived out there when I was a kid we lived on  a month and saved  after foodrentcar etc.,chicago,cvmm13j,3,t5_2qh2t

Many urban planning initiatives in cities that already have alleys include utilizing them better by allowing for coach houses or even just for a second smaller house on each lot on the alley frontage.When I think about Chicago alleys its not even just the  of alley rightofway that they occupy or the  garage setback on each side so total  alley width. Its also the way they influence how the remainder of the lot can be used. People want to put their garage right on the alley so that they dont have to waste lot space on driveway obviously so they use  of their lot depth on a  story garage thats  less backyard space than there might have been with a more efficient layout.I have actually Beautiful Minded out on city block layouts that use the standard Chicago th x th mile block dimensions.

If alternative medicine works for you then fine thats great but I personally feel that its mostly pseudoscience and a lot of the benefits are psychological like the placebo effect. For acid reflux most of the time this is either a dietary or genetic problem and theres not really a cure for it but you can reduce the symptoms. Coffee acidic foods fatty foods and spicy foods are known triggers of Acid Reflux. If dietary solutions dont work you can either take PPIs or Prokinetic drugs.

5592901,0,t1_cwq7mbp,Tribalism and clans.  And Im not being glib.  I think its integral to any understanding of either of those environments.  Its also why reform proposals based on what we could call libertarian ethics are just totally inapposite and hopeless because they dont understand that the unit of interaction is clan rather than individual for a lot of purposes.In Somalia a clan is called a qabiil and the qabiilada plural are subdivided into smaller subclans which can again divide and divide until were dealing with single extended families basically.  The clan structure makes it very difficult to run Somalia as a cohesive nation in kind of the same way that Afghanistan or Iraq are mere monikers rather than deeplyfelt realities in many parts of those nations.  Clanbased societies are not very trusting they tend not to have a great deal of abstraction in the way of large clanblind organizations that operate outside of clan structures.  Such institutions tend to become dominated by one or another clan and if not there are constant internal fights to produce such an outcome.Another interesting cultural factor is permissive polygamy which is superficially patriarchial but at the level of families is matriarchrun to a large extent.  Children are raised somewhat communally among the women of a particular subclan.Chicago has crude replications of clan structures in the form of streetgangs which of course are subdivided into smaller sets and subsets.  The matriarch effect is also quite prominent but due to the way it clashes with American culture and housing patterns I dont think it is nearly as effective as it would be in an actual African setting.Because for all the reputation a place like Somalia has for violence actual streetcrime is not that pervasive banditry is pervasive in some areas but thats somewhat different.,chicago,cwqcodl,19,t5_2qh2t

A  survey by the National Alliance to End Homelessness reported that there were approximately  homeless persons in the US with  individuals with schizophrenia or manicdepressive illness among them. Most of you have probably had the experience of walking downtown on the train or just around somewhere and seeing someone you thought was acting oddly. They may have been dressed in an unusual way perhaps disheveled or wearing an unusual collection of clothes makeup or jewelry that did not seem to fit any particular group or subculture. They may have been talking to themselves or yelling at someone you could not see. If you tried to speak to them they may have been difficult to follow or understand or they may have acted paranoid or started telling a bizarre story about the people who were plotting against them. If so chances are that you have encountered an individual with schizophrenia or another type of psychotic disorder. These are some of the most devastating forms of psychopathology and can negatively affect employment familial relations and general ability to function in society.

5755217,0,t1_cxagly1,From my understanding the  foot wall is on the table because residents complained about the potential noise from the new onramps. Sound pressure is logarithmic and a  decibel increase in sound pressure doubles the actual sound pressure.  A  db increase quadruples the actual sounds pressure and doubles the apparent sound level. So a  db reduction in sound level is actually about half as loud. Sound from a highway is about  db. Sound from a single car about  feet away is about  db. The epa says sleep disruption occurs around  db. Sound levels decrease with the cube of distance. So a  db decrease can actually make a huge difference in sound levels. It can be the difference between being unable to carry on a conversation in a speaking voice and being able to sleep peacefully. It would be great if people actually did some research before complaining about shit. Roadway engineers are extremely competent. They understand traffic flow and noise extremely well. They should obviously be questioned and concerns should be raised so they can address them but hurr durr db is nothing is completely wrong and incredibly unproductive. ,chicago,cxahmn6,7,t5_2qh2t

5764285,1,t1_cxbja80,gt four to six aimed shots would have been sufficientThats the type of thing that people say who have never handled a gun and know nothing about the pathology of a gunshot wound. Guns arent magic wands. Its not easy to shoot someone in a spot that immediately disables them. A determined attacker especially one on a dissociative drug could definitely keep attacking after being shot  or even  times if the heart and nervous system are left intact. They may die of their wounds shortly after but they wouldnt necessarily be immediately disabled. It sounds like the video is going to show him shooting the kid in the back while he wasnt posing an immediate threat and could have been subdued by less lethal means...but if the kid was coming after someone with a knife with intent to do harm and that someone had a gun shooting until the magazine is empty is a reasonable response. ,chicago,cxbm2kl,2,t5_2qh2t

The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO despite initial hopes has continued the same trend.     As an act of protest I have chosen to redact all the comments Ive ever made on reddit overwriting them with this message.

Figs according to the fruit growers I know get wrapped up or burrows in mulch and blankets to keep the root systems from freezing. Id plant close to the west side of a wall of a house so the wall can capture solar radiation and heat escaping from the house. Read up on growing out of your zone. Knew some people called Midwesg Fruit growers that would talk about grafting and how to grow peaches and figs in our zone. Also little green houses.

6368433,0,t1_czdidet,When a police officer enters a scene he should be able to address a situation and see if in person the things that are being said are actually occurring. Im not familiar with the situations that you talked about in your last comment but if those calls were fake and no one had a gun the officers should have seen that people didnt have guns and then not opened fire. You also said he wasnt giving the address or anything of value which he clearly was. Your main argument I would think is that you cant send out a police officer or emergency services to people if all they give to dispatchers is where they are and whether or not their life is in danger. Those were the two main pieces of info that LeGrier gave out. I would argue that the dispatchers can and should send emergency services once those two pieces of information are established. where and whether or not life is being immediately threatened should be the only criteria needed for sending emergency help because if there is a response and the call was real there is a chance that a life could be saved but if there is  a response and the call was fake the worst thing that happens ideally is that nothing happens. And the chances of the call being real and important seem much higher than the chances of it being fake. ,chicago,czdirrp,2,t5_2qh2t

6560464,0,t1_czxrbas,This is the difference to me Obama came into the white house under the pretense of being someone who was going to work both sides of the aisle to usher in change. That change wasnt necessarily taking wall street or congress to task and if you have followed Obama you will know he believes in gradual change. People those young and naive folks in turn realized that Obama wasnt ever aiming to do the things we wanted he just wanted to set us in the right direction given the ship and ocean we were sailing in.  years later we arent so naive. We have seen one of the least effective and corrupt governments this country has had in action and we are sick of it. I think people are aware that government does not function in the way we want it to and it certainly does not aim to function in our favor. Politicians are not necessarily corrupt so much as the system is  if you want to win elections you need money. The American people are in tune to that now and Sanders is one of the few playing our tune and the fact that he has come out and said I am on sale for the American people and only the American people and I aim to get populist bill xy and Z through our government and the fact that he has managed to make as much money from his supporters suggests to me that people support that and are willing to show up when he calls for them. As a DIEHARD Sanders supporter honestly I have very little faith that he will get any of these campaign promises through in  years. But what he WILL do that I think is far more important is change the way people react to our government  if Ted Cruz is forcing a shutdown president Sanders isnt going to say I am disappointed in the Republican candidates... three weeks later  Sanders is going to be having a fireside chat that evening saying that the only thing we can do is wait  more years and get Cruz voted out. Even if I dont get college and healthcare included for paying my taxes I have faith that voting for Sanders is going to change the landscape. In fact he already HAS by getting so many people to contribute to his campaign which I think is going to have far reaching implications in the next few elections win or lose.,chicago,czxwn67,25,t5_2qh2t

We have worldclass options  the Art Institute is amazing as is the Field Museum and the Museum of Science and Industry. I would also second going to Second City. Its a lot of fun.I go to music shows alone reasonably often so Id say that its totally worth it if something piques your interest. We have an incredible amount of live music here.Wander around downtown. Walk down Michigan Avenue from the Hancock Building south to Millennium Park and stop by the Bean one of our most famous and photographed public art pieces.Go to the top of the Sears Tower its technically the Willis Tower now but a lot of us still call it the Sears and check out the views and the Skydeck where you can stand on a glass floor  stories directly above the street.Get some deep dish pizza. Some people might say thats touristy but I dont agree. Ive lived here for  years and everyone I know here myself included loves it. Lou Malnatis and Pequods are your best options. Lous has locations all over the place. Pequods only has one in the city and it tends to be crowded but for good reason.Take an architecture boat tour. Youll learn a lot about our architectural heritage which is an immense part of our history. We played a major part in the development of the sky scraper in the early s.The Lincoln Park Zoo is free. Downtown is fun and impressive but the heart of the city is in its neighborhoods. If you have time Id recommend visiting Wicker Park Damen stop on the Blue Line is the most central part lots of shops and fun restaurants. Lincoln Park is also great and massive. Lakeview is where a lot of people new to Chicago live and for good reason  its accessible and theres a lot to do. Feel free to send me a message if you have any other questions.

So they want the exhibit shut down to protect youth from exposure to such immorality.  They even believe that Van Gogh would be upset that sexual activities were somehow associated with his work.

The building could go anywhere even underground and have no impact on the visitors experience inside.  My opinion extends to the existing museums but theyre now permanent structures so theres no point in objecting.

He makes sure its on leash now cause if I see him without it hell get an earful again and tbh Ill probably call animal control  the dog scares the shit out of me and I own two German shepherds He had his dog off leash at an outdoor cafe.

They are much heavier than a normal bike and have only  speeds and thus cant go as fast as your bike.

Third theres a TON of restaurants in the city but depending where you guys want to go what type of cuisine etc. I would stay in the West Loop.

Having a pipeline that allows heavy crude to cheaply flow to the gulf states would indeed lower the supply available to BP at Whiting which would naturally raise the price compared to lighter crudes.  BP could respond by changing the mix they use at Whiting  currently about  heavy.  This would indeed have the effect of reducing the amount of petcoke produced.  They could also raise the prices of the refined oil products coming out of the refinery to account for higher crude prices.What they wont do is shut down Whiting or lower capacity there since the Chicago region still needs its gasoline.,chicago,d32rnrs,1,t5_2qh2t

7599605,0,t3_4intix,gt If you are in a situation where you believe that suicide is something that is an optionSuicide absolutely always is an option and its the one Im electing to take. It is a responsible rational longterm  years from now plan of mine and one that has the support of my loved ones. Dont blanket statement this stuff.There are people who have objectively shitty lives who are perfectly happy living them out and there are people who have objectively awesome lives who arent. I have no right to make you end your lifeor keep living itand you have no right to do so mine.The decision not to commit suicide can be responsible and the decision to commit suicide can be responsible. I like to call it stupid suicide and smart suicide both with a bit of a smirk on my face.When little nineyearold Jennie comes home from school heartbroken because she passed a love note written in pink gel pen to Kevin and he stuck his tongue out at her and so she looks in the cabinet and swallows twenty Tylenol tablets thats stupid suicide. Stupid stupid suicide.Fourtyyearold Jonathan on the other hand has had crippling treatmentresistant anxiety all his life. He has never been able to hold a job and recently lost his longtime partner to cancer. He no longer is able to afford a home of his own and will likely not be able to again. After three decades of medication and psychotherapy he has begun to explore endoflife options such as Dignitas with his treatment team making sure his family is aware of this and has his back. In three years short of any miracle that makes his life worth living to him again he decides he will end his life. It is major life decisionliterally lifeanddeathand he treats it accordingly. This is responsible rational smart suicide. Obviously both of these are caricatures of reallife situations. Rarely if ever are things so cutanddry these are two examples on opposite extreme ends of the smartstupid spectrum. However reallife suicide falls somewhere on the spectrum and its best for all those involved when its closest to smart.More and more countries around the world are beginning to recognise the right of those with physical illnesses and mental illnesses to selfdetermination in children as young as  I was hoping Chicago would be progressive enough to support this but evidently not.To those of you who have lost loved ones to smart suicide I am sorry for the pain of your loss. But know that the pain that your loves ones endured was even worse and forcing them to continue in such pain would be a selfish act not one out of love. To quote Brenda Lees Englishlanguage cover of dith Piafs marvellous Hymne  lamourgt If you love me really love me  let it happen I wont care.If youre thinking about stupid suicide absolutely please use OPs resources.

7642446,0,t1_d3auxsi,Some motorists drive aggressively and there are enough of them that the average cyclist will experience at least one illegal maneuver a day typically passing with less than three feet.  Having a door opened in their path is another common one though more done out of ignorance than aggression.  I think the aggression toward cyclists is more a lack of understanding.  I once had a guy try to attack me with a steering wheel lock for taking the lane and riding outside of the door zone.  Given the choice of endangering myself by riding in the door zone and inconveniencing someone by blocking an unsafe pass Ill inconvenience someone else every time.  Its only a few seconds.  The resulting police report and detention took the driver much longer than it took me to get down that block.  I think if he understood I was acting for my own safety he wouldnt have reacted as he did.  But some people are just seething buckets of rage behind the wheel.

Raciallymotivated practices like Redlining restrictive covenants and predatory housing contracts made it pretty much impossible for black families to move into white neighborhoods through most of the th century.But really the biggest factor was what happened when they did manage to move into those neighborhoods White Flight. Just look at neighborhoods like North Lawndale and Garfield Park on the West Side they were thriving middleclass hubs for European immigrants and their families but as soon as blacks started moving in they ALL moved to the suburbs and they took all their wealth and resources with them. In Chicago this was aided by shitty fearmongering real estate brokers through something called blockbusting The result is neighborhoods that in  are  black with huge pockets of poverty and yes crime.So yeah uJob youre absolutely right about Bronzeville as opposed to say all the black neighborhoods west of the Dan Ryan which were mostly white until the sss.Edit formatting,chicago,d3w95r9,26,t5_2qh2t

Also explains how Chicago uses yellows that shorter than ITE recommendations despite your sources falsely claiming they are followed.If you read the FHWA study that uses higher vehicle speeds than chicago the conclusion is quite interesting.

8288914,0,t1_d5ddheh,I LOVE LOVE LOW INFORMATION REDDIT USERS  VOTERS!SO Mayor Richard Daley comes up with this plan to lease the parking meters to Morgan Stanley for  Billion dollars and somehow was able to really get . BILLION up front to blow on whatever the hell he wanted to Remember this was when we were not really in the running for the  Olympics and some of that cash was wasted buying things like the Michael Reese Hospital for stupid money and just like an Arkansas mobile home resident who wins the Powerball lotto it was blown pretty fucking quickly just not on velvet Elvis paintings. What sucks is that Chicago meters were really worth at least  Billion and Daley and most of the alderman sold everyone out for a song. So all that fucking money that was coming previously to fix potholes and improve other city services is now going to Morgan Stanley and the Dubai Royal family for the next  years and us peons who have to park in Chicago are going to pay for it not to mention all the future increases in parking fees to come.Get used to the idea of Chicago becoming New Detroit unless some really drastic measures arent done soon because it will only get worse. ,chicago,d5do8sx,3,t5_2qh2t

8399461,0,t3_4uklf2,Bottom line I hope that neither your broker nor any lawyer sold you this house on the promise that youll be able to make that third unit legal. That would have been inmyopinion fraudulent because you absolutely are not going to be able to have the third unit approved if it never existed legally before without expending a considerable amount of money in the system more money than that third unit is worth in rent.The way it works is that each residential lot has a zoning level and each zoning level has a Minimum Lot Area Per Unit MLAPU.  Keeping in mind that a standard Chicago residential lot is  sq. ft. and keeping in mind that the common zonings in inner neighborhood areas are RS RT. and RT the RS zoning has an MLAPU of  sq. ft. RT. zoning has an MLAPU of  sq. ft. and RT has an MLAPU of  sq. ft. That means that they would allow   or  units respectively on a standard lot.If youre trying to go over the number of units allowed on your lot by zoning youll probably need to upzone your lot and thats going to cost you money. Chicago is a very corrupt town. Politicians know that upzoning means that youre getting more value whether its in terms of an extra unit to rent or a bigger house. So they rent seek and basically require some sort of bribes or campaign contributions in order to grant the upzoning.There are loopholes for buildings that were grandfathered into having additional units. You have to prove that it had the basement unit before some date I think in the s but dont quote me on that. The most common way of proving it is to request the water records and see if there was a third unit receiving water.,chicago,d5rh9e2,1,t5_2qh2t

I called him out on it and told him to get off the train for being a perv after informing the girl who was unaware of what was happening behind her. She quickly retreated to the other side of the car when I pointed him out.He wouldnt get off the train and when I tried to force him he hit the emergency button and the train operator told us both to get off.

8476257,0,t1_d611njf,Further responses.  What the standard game there?That all depends but its normally either by time moves or both. This is agreed to by each player beforehand. Some people play blitz which is limited to  min bear in mind the clock is only moving when its your turn but that is not my cup of tea. International FIDE sanctioned chess has a standard time of  moves in  hours and then an extra hour to reach move . After this if the game is still in progress a quick play finish decides the game. Though it rarely gets to this point in post end game. Players will typically resign when they know the position is hopeless. Its considered rude to grind it out when you know you are fucked.  What if you are really shitty? Would it be a waste of everyones time?Not at all. How are you going to improve if you do not play people better than you? Not every match played there is the type where the stress is such that people think that the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Some people are just looking to have a good time and maybe pick up some strategy. Chess is an endurance trial battle of wits typically played by a couple of very bright people at the highest levels but you have to start somewhere.  Do you have to bring your own clock?You can bring your own chess clock but if you are looking for a game you can pretty much just show up. There are always plenty of people there with boards pieces clocks etc. The most popular on the go tournament sets can be picked up cheaply. The board rolls up like a poster and the pieces are carried in a satchel that looks about like a smaller version of a messenger bag. If you are looking to buy a chess clock I recommend you keep things pretty simple. There are some incredibly sophisticated clocks on the market which sound cool but  of the functionality they offer is never used by the average player. ,chicago,d612oa9,1,t5_2qh2t

Rahm just as an example is not of our ilk. Me a Bernie voter and some Trump supporter as different as we may be have more in common with each other than our mayor has with any of those who voted for him. By and large political positions are not considered public servant roles by those who wish to attain them. Its a career. As with anyone with a career the goal is to advance yourself and make as much money as you can doing it. Is it any wonder that our politicians are so ineffective and corrupt? Ask yourself this question why the fuck does the Daley family have a compound? How much money could he have made or both of them solely from their salaries as mayors? Where did the rest come from and how much must it have been to afford a goddamn compound? We can protest all we want but all well get are press conferences and speeches that appease the herd. Im hopeful that Bernie will use his platform to channel donations to candidates that are fighting the good fight but its not possible for those donations to support every election. We need people like Faisal Khan to continue to call out the corruption and we need normal citizens to organize and rally behind a single candidate for each position starting with those where the incumbent has been proven to participate in corruption. ,chicago,d64ut14,1,t5_2qh2t

I had zero complaints with them and they could get me seen within a week if I needed anything.  I got sent to Omaha to have a surgery done since the Des Moines hospital had its surgery wing shut down for renovation for a month or so.  Omaha was also excellent and I had no problem getting my travel expenses reimbursed and the facility amp care was top notch as it was attached to the University of Nebraska Medical Center.  Here in Chicago is a whole different story.  The people who work at Jesse Brown mean well but the place is way under staffed and under resourced.  Just getting a referral to a private provider is a challenge over there because youve basically gotta get in line with everyone else.  On top of that the place is difficult to navigate as everything is poorly signed and the various offices are poorly labeled.  The best way to sum up the VA is it depends as your care at one facility can be a total  from another,chicago,d6r6paj,1,t5_2qh2t

Do you not see that innocent people are dying and the BLM movement is the aggregator? Do you not see month after month Chicago hits new high scores with violence? And for some insane reason I cannot fathom we are pointing the fingers at police and telling them they are the issue? Our response to out of control violence is to punish the cops and make it easier for criminals to do their jobs. And no instead of making this an issue with poverty and crime we instead make it about race. Oh and we arent allowed to talk about race unless we are a minority otherwise were bigots and our opinions are seeded in racism an therefore our thoughts should be disregarded.I come to reddit for open safe discussion to vent my fears and anger and HOPEFULLY work towards talking about solutions. But anytime I try to have this conversation I am labeled a bigotracist and the conversation turns into a shitshow of pointing fingers. Is there a subreddit I can post on that will allow me to do this? Granted I am no saint. I am not afraid to point out statistics and come up with reasons for why those statistics are so skewed towards one race. And although I can get hotheaded and hateful I respect every persons right to live a happy free life so long as they deserve one. But I mean I was just robbed and my paranoia about racecrime was unfortunately further confirmed after watching the surveillance footage and seeing who robbed me. So yeah I get that the way I am posting shit is pretty obviously fishing for fights but open intellectual arguments can lead to solutions. Pointing fingers at someone and writing off their existence to try and make youself seem like a better person is not working towards a solution. Its just ignoring the problem and passing it on to someone else. If I am a bigot racist Id like someone to convince me so.

8841339,0,t1_d7aff04,gtIm not glossing over anything. Im simply putting things into perspective. Traffic tickets which were written justifiably mind you just aggressive enforcement is an incredibly minor problem in comparison to the massive numbers of homicides and violent attacks in Chicago and St. Louis Baltimore etc..Its not a dichotomy though.  We can focus on multiple things simultaneously.  Its not which problem is more important.  Especially when both problems are addressed by different groups.  BLM is an organization meant to combat injustices with state violencemistreatment.  Kaboom Playworks  Black Men of Chicago and dozens of other groups are organizations meant to work toward a decrease in inner city crime through mentoring job programs recess and a bunch of other ways.  gt There would be much less interaction with the police if the crime fell to a rate commensurate with the rest of the Western world. If people interacted with police less aggressively the interactions would be less likely to end negatively. Focusing on the police here is getting away from the elephant in the room.How often there is interaction is irrelevant.  With any job you are required to behave within certain standarsrulesregulations. If you cannot then you should not be employed in that field.  gt The point is that it is a comically bad way to allocate time and resources and doesnt address the most significant problems. In the case of Chicago it has made the situation worse.As I said previously there are various organization.  Each with their own goals and motives.  Stop thinking BLM is an organization whos goal is preventing or changing gangstreet level crime.  Its not never has been. BLM is an organization that works whether the work is usefulbeneficial is a different debate against STATE violence and behavior.  gt Maybe the problem isnt the officers did you ever think of that? The same results even when the police are entirely people from the same community.Thats a poor rhetorical question.  You havent provided any reasons why a rational person would think there arent issues with officers. Ive copypasted this a few times over the last few weeks but Ill do it once more.  There are plenty of instances of officers across this entire country behavior poorly behaving with bias and abusing their authority.  Ignoring that there is a huge problem with police precincts nationwide is being willfully ignorant.    SF Officers saying niggers should fucking hang or calling women nigger bitches   Officers in Miami Ft Lauderdale and Ohio saying similar things about black people  Heres another officer in New Orleans being racist  Lets not leave out New Jersey  And another one in Georgia  One of the best anecdotes is  min interview from a former Baltimore officer who talked about how they systematically targeted black people to bolster arrest numbers.    This one in Michigan is pretty bad as well.  This guys actions led to around  cases being overturned due to him setting people up. He talks about it himself.  If youre insinuating that its reasonable for officers to treat black people different because of crime statisticsrates then that is fine.  Just keep that in mind whenever a black person mentions an experience with racism you shouldnt complain.  ,chicago,d7alqj8,3,t5_2qh2t

For example the drug trade is heavily concentrated on the west side in Hispanic neighborhoods yet there is significantly lower crime in those neighborhoods albeit it is still high vs the city average. Those areas have just as much poverty and have less access to public transit.Your comments on education make little sense. It is the same school system and curriculum for the rest of the city. Underprivileged students have preferential access to many of the afterschool programs and selective enrollment schools. The truancy rates show large numbers of kids arent even going to school. I volunteered at Woodlawn High quite a bit from  and from my experience there the issue was not that the kids were lacking teaching resources to learn to read or understand basic math. Much of the violence today is coming from people that are well under the age of  often even under  which makes most of your arguments about opportunities a bit moot.

My building has  units and I rent through a management company with many other buildings as well. They have to follow the Chicago Building Code and I am entitled to all Chicago city tenants rights. That would include trying to force me out of my current lease or discriminate me from a new lease based on me complaining to the city. I will say they are making it very easy to break my lease by offering but they did not force it or threaten it which is the illegal part offerok forceno.

Mr. Shields a longtime savory chef who did a tour at the famed Chicago restaurant Alinea and his wife and business partner Karen Urie Shields a former executive pastry chef at another noted Chicago eatery Charlie Trotters conceptualize the desserts.

9604100,0,t3_5chyjf,I think part of Trumps success that pisses me of the most is the getting support off division and putting people up against eachother. Now in two days hes already trying to give us bullshit that hes for all and we should unite hunky dory after he just threw gasoline on everything for a year. Ive already heard too many stories personal and online in just one week of election day like this. I dont think this kind of stuff would be happening with Jeb Rubio or even Ted Cruz because they know presidents and national leaders just cant say backhand inflammatory shit. I dont think you would find attacker filmed videos of people beating the shit out of Jeb Bush supporters or even Ted Cruz emboldening people to flash knives at Muslim people on a bus and telling them to get deported. Even Ted knows thats wrong.Thats why Ive been really really fucking depressed the last few days. Feel like ChicagoIllinois just spent a week being obviously more divided than it was last week. I didnt play any musicheadphones on the L this week on purpose and I heard plenty of people relating the same feelings.Well you know what? Trump might be a few hundred miles away in Washington as our president but he can fuck off because hes not running our morals or our mayors office. Dont ever silently accept this behavior and keep a watchful eyehelping hand for other strangers that you see might be getting harassed. Being how socially liberal we are here I think this will continue to be a minority of assholes that we can to police ourselves.When I heard from a Muslim friend of ours got a knife pulled on her at uiuc bus people asked for proof blah blah blah must be a Soros shill  Ill be honest I wanted to clock  the next Trump supporter I saw with that fucking red hat so hard their teeth would be flying out. Dont. Get pissed off somewhere else or vent to someone. I have an ungodly royal temper Ive learned to control over the years and If I can you can. I stayed home for a few more hours pissed as fuck until I calmed down. It might feel good for  seconds some people might even deserve it after comments like this but unless your safety is threatened its not going to get you anywhere.... but a potential YouTube video the Donald can masterbate furiously to so they can desperately point out how they are better than half of America...

10226074,0,t1_dc352hb,Radiators are most likely powered across multiple apartments by a single boiler and the temperature is not variable per apartment. Apologies if you already know this but just in caseHow hot to the touch are your radiators? If they are not hot as fucking hell you can probably turn them up yourself. If they are hot as fucking hell then you do in fact have a heat loss problem.Almost all radiators have local controls that you can adjust yourself. Usually this is a valve at the bottom of a radiator. Many radiators have handles that can be spun often called a wheel valve but a large minority have bolts that require a wrench this is not uncommon in rentals where landlords dont like there shit fidgeted with. Counter clockwise is open.The supply valve is different from the steam vent valve or air vent valve which are usually at the top of the radiator. If your radiators are only lukewarm but the supply valve is fully open they may need to be bled have cold air pockets removed. I wouldnt try this yourself as you should turn off the boiler to do it and the process differs depending on type of radiators you have. However if you tell your landlord that you think the radiators need to be bled they might be more amenable to doing something. Its free its easy its normalThis site has a pretty good overview of radiator types and valves If any of this seems overwhelming to you dont hesitate to ask a handy friend for help. This is all quite simple if youre familiar at all with housing systems.,chicago,dc36l5l,3,t5_2qh2t

Ive been on preventative meds since i was  to reduce frequencyseverity but weed is what makes me not suicidal during attacks. Everything else has negative body effects takes  hours to work even a little if it even works at all all. I also wish there was more research to figure out why. It helps quickly and significantly and it seems to be a neuro thing. I dont feel a lot of euphoria during the high just very sleepy and then the weird thing is when I dont smoke I get crippling dysphoria followed by extreme euphoria after the headache. With weed I just feel a bit tired after no euphoria. I wonder if it blocks some sort of receptor.,chicago,dc5915q,6,t5_2qh2t

10322301,0,t1_dce1m3c,I think low morale is due to a number of reasons the stress of the job.  Dealing with the worst of society every day. Shootings poverty inequality untreated mental illness. It takes its toll. In general when officers start the job they have a im gonna save the world mentality. Theyre gonna be the good officers who catch criminals and serve the community. Instead officers run into roadblocks in their attempt to achieve that goal. Its easy to become disillusioned Over time you start to loose empathy for victims. You become indifferent. Its just another jobreport. This doesnt help relations with the community or officer morale.  Its a negative feedback loop. The DOJ report touches on this.  The promotional system. Not only are tests for supervisors detectives Evidence techs ks rare Its also often assumed you need to be politically connected to get most of those spots. An officer who feels like heshe can never be promoted or moved to a more desirable position  no matter how hard they work will not have very high morale. . We read the news and social media. Its easy to get the impression that everyone hates cops and sees you as a racist. Easy to see how that hurts morale. As far as solutions? I guess make the promotional system more transparent. Let people see how you graded the tests. What were the requirements to promoting  someone as merit. Increase the amount of sergeants detectives and ETs. The city is way too short on those positionsanother problem mentioned in the report  It wont solve everything but its a start.  There is likely  no solution for . The job is stressful by nature. Cops have to learn to deal with it without becoming indifferent to human suffering. Mental health treatment may be able to help. ,chicago,dce38k5,12,t5_2qh2t

Wont approve my nominee? Great. Ill pick a random name from a hat for the next  days and submit that person. Lets see you earn that paycheck Paul Mitch. Ill write an executive order requiring Federal elected officials be paid in bags of cents and when challenged on it ask why they havent done anything useful like they were elected to do.

The burden of proof is on the people of Chicago.Second comparing an area to Afghanistan it dehumanizes the city population. Also it sets the stage for the federal government to start treating the city like we do in Afghanistan. Would people care if there is a drone strike on a gangbanger? What about warrantless searches and renditions? Oh there will be people crying foul about constitutional rights but there will be more people that say that they deserved it the city deserved it.

Of course corporations shield individuals from financial risk but were talking here of the organizations.  The individuals are not at risk because they are sheltered by the corporation.  In passing we should note they will be paid salaries and management fees from taxpayer funds.  Now it might happen that the market rate unsubsidized units dont generate the hoped for income but that failure only reduces incomes without generating an actual financial risk for the corporations because the tax dollars will continue to flow nonetheless and the operator can simply step back on expenses down to the minimal floor tolerated by the taxpayers.,chicago,ddm613n,1,t5_2qh2t

Tackling full on police reform while you are renegotiating pensions just couldnt have happened. Unions are not the friends of taxpayers or the Mayor and it would have created a massive political fight beyond just the pension fight. He was already fighting a two front war with CPS to get it into line. Reforming CPS and renegotiating contractspension at the same time is what led to the major sstorm a few years back.You have to pick your battles. That being said no more excuses.

Im a proponent of exploring everything the city has to offer and exploring the multiculturalism that is Chicago.  However in this sub people pull toward two extremes either a never leave the north sideafluent areas or b throw all caution to the wind because the media over sensationalizes the news and Chicago is plenty safe when in all reality there are shades of gray. I grew up on the Southside and commuted to high school heading back and forth up halsted damen ashland cottage etc.  There are less than stellar neighborhoods that I would have no problem stopping for food in at a certain time of day because Ive lived here long enough to develop a little bit of street smarts over what a good and bad situation looks like.  OP admitted that they are a recent transplant and I have no idea where they are from.   Ive taken the red line home to th before and I wouldnt recommend that to anyone new to the city because doing it after about  PM is going to get you mugged.

Those are not the same thing.So to clarify Being here without status doesnt constitute a criminal offense.  Nonetheless being here without status is reason enough to be deported... ...but being here without status does not in and of itself does not make one a criminal.In other words being deportable does NOT mean being a criminal. NO civil or state law has been broken. So yeah not all undocumented aliens are criminals even though they can all be deported.Which part of this is not clear?,chicago,de6iw6m,0,t5_2qh2t

11035781,0,t1_deitjhb,This is the source of the idea of Spring Cleaning.  The coal dust settled everywhere.  Some days you could taste it on the air outside.  On really bad days you could taste it inside the house.  Like when a strong wind just at roof top caused an inversion and pushed the smoke back down the chimney.  A sloppy housekeeper could leave a thin cover of coal dust on neglected window sills.  As a small kid I recall visiting in such a house and finding sills at my eye level so coated.  And got in trouble for doing finger painting with the black dust.  Back home I was told it was thought discourteous to call attention to the neglect.Our bungalow belt bungalow one of more than  across the city burned more than a ton of anthracite coal each winter.  Much more if we bought the cheaper dirtier bituminous.  And the wood two story Neo Queen Anns burned even more.  Only the really fancy brick garages had incinerators built into their alley corners.  To achieve the high heat necessary for garbage they had smoke stacks that reached up about  feet from the ground.  A few survive.  The concrete boxes that every house had and some still do was for garbage.  If you tried burning in those youd just get a stinking pile.  Which I know from the personal experience of my delinquent older brother.Incinerator with its chimney top removed  The little door is where you drop in the coal and garbage.  The big door is where the Gmen shoveled out the remains.  See the bricks set vertically in the wall about half way up?  Those are vent openings for the chimney to help the fire draw at start although that interfered with generating the very high heat needed.  A very large load at one time or a home owner who screwed up the start by dropping in wet stuff too soon would stink up the whole neighborhood for hours and sometimes days.City mandated concrete garbage can yes it is more like a box but everyone called it a can  ,chicago,deivwye,2,t5_2qh2t

I said most taxesfees paid to government  not most taxes paid to the state  and specifically mentioned that Illinois had a low income tax but high property and sales taxes.  Our property taxes are among the highest in the nation and the majority goes to fund CPSgtSome states with high property taxes like New Hampshire and Texas rely heavily on property taxes in lieu of other major tax categories others like New Jersey and Illinois impose high property taxes alongside high rates in the other major tax categories...New Jersey has the highest effective rate at . percent and is followed closely by New Hampshire . percent and Illinois . percent. On the other end of the spectrum Hawaii has the lowest effective rate at . percent and is followed closely by Alabama . percent Louisiana . percent and Wyoming . percent. As for sales taxes Cook County Illinois home to Chicago raised its countylevel sales tax by  percent from . percent to . percent on January  . The sales tax rate in the city of Chicago increased to . percent as a result. This gives Chicago the distinction of imposing the highest sales tax of any large city in the United States.

Its housing that is nice for students and new immigrants to get established financially in a friendly community.  But once they are established they want more space and nicer amenities just like every immigrant group ever in Chicago.So the drop in Latino immigration over the last decade has cutoff the new supply of renters interested in the quality of stock here.I sit on the Local School Council of Pilsen Academy.  Some families have left because they bought homes further southwest in the city.  One family had their landlord raise rent by  so they moved out and found new affordable housing in the neighborhood and their old unit has been vacant for months... It doesnt appear that the landlord upgraded anything so none of the young professionals want to live there.My neighbors who are homeowners arent moving out.  Theres an assumption that all of the Mexicans in Pilsen are poor but thats just ignorant.  There has been a large Mexican population in Chicago at least since the s my family is one of them.  My grandfather served in WWII joined a union and when UIC moved in he used the GI bill to buy a house in the burbs.  Others moved to Pilsen.

You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.     After doing all of the above you are welcome to join me on Voat,chicago,dgvuz1u,-1,t5_2qh2t
