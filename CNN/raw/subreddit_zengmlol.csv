5129069,0,t1_cv47tpn,Ratings up and downI could make position flexible and based on playing time. I would have to think long and hard about it though. It adds a lot of complexity. Structurethanks for this. Ill review it some more and see what I think.Sister teamsI think you are right. Might be a stretch at first. Not sure how vital this is. But maybe at some point.TraitsThe only issue is complexity. Ideally I would keep the traits within a reasonable amount. So to add one you have to remove another.Thanks for the feedback!Im going to put it together with everything else and make posts on these topics one by one to get things finalized.,zengmlol,cv48ty7,1,t5_39yde
5134416,0,t1_cv4vf2a,I think a good idea would be having champions subratings for positions since there are champions that can function on multiple roles and lanes.So maybe like this on a  scalegtX champgttop gtjungle gtmid gtadc gtsupport You could also add multiple sub roles for champs because there are champs that can go either tanky or damage build.I really like that you are going at this projext the right way and not halfassing it!,zengmlol,cv4vzzu,1,t5_39yde
5138282,0,t1_cv5bfgl,So for the initial version of NA and EU is this necessary?I can see once you get Asia involved. But does it add much to the game otherwise?,zengmlol,cv5csq7,1,t5_39yde
5189662,0,t1_cvbimxo,I can agree Objective Control  ShotCalling. SSA and SSE could become important when you start looking into champions. Some champions I.E. Ezreal Leblanc KogMaw utilize poking a lot to chip down their enemies. They can result in kills and objectives but they dont necessarily require you to go for the kill. For these champs at least they could easily be used for champion zoning to help secure an objective.I think Lane Switching is its own beast I.E. switching Top and Bot Mid and Top. Although it is similar to ganking I think roaming is slightly different but I did a poor job distinguishing the two. My examples were more related to ganking. Roaming is probably more like SupportJungler wandering the jungles to place wards jungler going for dragonOpponent jungle monsters while opponent jungler is ganking. I suppose Roaming isnt necessary for this game however and its task could be given to other areas Broken up into jungle control ganking vision. I broke down your ResilienceEndurance into different terms to better define the two. Adaptability is for ingame changes the definition of react to set back I took as careerseries set backs which I think is an important one to add that I left out. Another example of this is if you fell behind in the laning phase wether the player could adapt his aggression to not feed as well as the team strategy changes mid game. The other part it was broken into was Tilt. This would affect how well the player reacts to winning and losing series. Emotional players could have higher tilt than others. Readressing the italicized I would also add a career length one of this as well Resilience The players career path lower resilience more likely to retire early. Uses Adaptability Fortitude Consistency Stamina Injury Prone,zengmlol,cvbjn2f,1,t5_39yde
5192022,0,t1_cvbsqsg,Youre totally right there arent a heck of a lot. Three really jump out at me and thats about it Rule fredy and Empt. The problem is that we need a massive database to cover all the possible players the game has to generate. Now with the probability system most players wouldnt have a number at the end of their name making  million names. We could cutreduce the number of numbers chosen but completely cutting them reduces our variety to  million names. Still probably more than enough for most people but human names First Last Names can cover  million. Im open to suggestions on what we can do to help increase the number of names in the database without numbers .,zengmlol,cvbtxza,1,t5_39yde
5688870,0,t1_cx1cnes,Then keep in mind that it isnt always about money for players. A player will accept a contract if the organisation is treating him right. For instance Svenskeren received a wellpaid contract offer from HK Gaming but had another offer from TSM with a smaller wage. He wanted to accept HKs offer but was discussing with TSM as well so HK threatened to take legal action against TSM and told him that he is legally bound to their team. Therefore Svenskeren went to TSM for a smaller wage.Its either thisbeing threatened despite being offered a better contract or the fact that he is a veteran in that team and loves the club like Faker. Faker had the chance to leave SKT and earn a lot of money but decided to stay with his team as thats the team where he first won his worlds.Keep this in mind. ,zengmlol,cx29ctv,2,t5_39yde
5718058,0,t1_cx5uyek,As per ratings ofcourse I dont want it to be too intimidating and as I said about myself earlier I might just want a little too much but also I might be a little too interested in stats. I think if youll use the list at Traits thats much better though and ofcourse you could possibly expand later if theres a need for it.I think Ill be able to judge about the Find Similair Player once I use it. Maybe itd be cool to be able to sort players on multiple stats maybe that seems cool.I dont have data for Momentum but I assume that in general if you perform well or win a lot your morale raises and that often leads to being more confident which improves your play. But maybe its just a stupid suggestion if you already have something like morale in your game.There are some players in pro League that play at multiple positions WildTurtle used to be top Chauster used to play ever position liftlift used to be support yellowstar used to be adc alex ich used to be jg Hai has played on every position I think PePiiNeRo swaps to ADC when playing vs fnatic so I think it would be interesting to see how thisd work. Anyway great job on everything else so far! Im really interested and I cant wait D,zengmlol,cx5vqdc,1,t5_39yde

5904019,0,t3_3w3kbf,Fun game but still kind of unplayableFew bugs that I ran into while playingSometimes after buying players that are free agent after progressing a day it will remove a random sub player.If you play from beginning of season and click to play until playoffs then you will be stuck after it goes through the matches as there will be no upcoming matches yet when you try to progress a day week month or until playoffs it will do nothing then when you click play again it will be blank until you refresh page yet you click progress a day and the same thing repeats. These two bugs what ive encountered the most and its stopping me from enjoying this game I hope you can sort these out as I got pretty interested in this .Btw if you could add a few more in depth details to how you invest money into coaches like what they do to improve your players I think that would be awesome. Also I chose a team that was in the lowest league and I was able to sign players with like  overall even though their mood was very low It makes the league an easy win if i just sign  players with  and i doubt those players would join a team in that league considering they might have LCS or even CS offers. ,zengmlol,cxtju5p,3,t5_39yde

Only now my loading bar doesnt even fill it just sort of stops and it seems to be at random points. Sometimes at halfway sometimes only about  full.Im playing on . now but had this issue in previous versions and Im playing in LCS w LadderI had always just assumed it meant that there was nobody wanting to trade for that players as it does a similar thing in the Trade page when you hit What would make this deal work and theres nothing that will make it work it just sort of stays there until you change pages.,zengmlol,cyey81s,1,t5_39yde

6925316,0,t3_4ahg58,In order for that to be worthwhile I need to input the champion countersynergy data. That is a pretty big project. Until that is complete there isnt a countering strategy in the game.Once that is in the game then doing live game pickingbanning makes sense. However that would be a be a pretty major features. It would entail rewriting how the live game is done the actual games are done before you see the live game display so that wouldnt work anymore. ,zengmlol,d11b584,2,t5_39yde
