2061377,0,t1_cl1u1rj,You should never punish someone for doing a bad attack. When I joined everyone was really supportive of me as a new player pushing my limits and learning what I can and cannot do. That atmosphere made me want to not be a liability to the team. Its also the reason that I can reliably get  stars now in any given clan war and you guys are the ones I have to thank for that. Im pretty sure shadow explained the theory behind massdrags for  minutes to me when I first joined. A couple of the senior members watched and critiqued my attacks which gave me a lot of feedback on where to improve.That being said you all need to encourage each other. There is no reason that th bases with obvious antiair setups should be getting mass dragged there are much more efficient strategies than that. There is also no reason that people are still messing up mass dragons a month into using it. Everyone should be pushing each other to learn new strategies and practice them both in and out of war to learn how and when to use them.StrategiesTh Mass DragGiant wiz healTh Mass dragHogsGowipe although personally I think th gowipe sucks.ThLoonianGowipeGowiwiGovapeHolowiwiLava hounds?,RedditSnow,cl1ugl1,1,t5_318ue
