I started by doing bulletin board missions until I came across the smuggling missions. Thats when my Han Solo side woke up and started enjoying the game. After polishing my smuggling skills and getting enough money to have my Imperial Courier fully fit to my specs now Im transitioning to CZRES Hunter. Im having a blast with it.

4674547,0,t3_3ey59l,This is good but I want to expand on this a bit more.The best way to go about looking for a HiRES is to check System Maps for ringed gas giants. If youre still getting your feet wet with combat check the systems to make sure they have a high security level. This will boost the level of space cops who will be helping you out.When it comes to finding the good spawn BE PATIENT! It can take several resets sometimes but like OP says its well worth the wait.Another tip I want to reiterate is DONT GET COCKY. If youre in a smaller ship its very possible to still bank in these HiRES areas. Just wait for the system authority vessels to wear down the ship youre aiming for and when the armor gets low THEN attack. You just need to land a hit within  seconds of the ship going boom and youll get credit for the kill. Also TARGET THE SUBSYSTEMS! This will really help with chewing through that tough Python or Vulture armor. Target the Power Plant since as of right now if you take that thing out the ship blows up. Itll be patched soon so take advantage of this while you can. You can also target the Drive which will disable the ships thrusters.Never go in without a Kill Warrant Scanner. These puppies will easily double the payout on wanted ships. Keep in mind that the KWS gives you access to all warrants that a wanted ship may have which may require you to travel to Alliance Fed or Empire space. I found a great HiRES in Kremainn thats close to a station and it is only a couple jumps from the starting system. Its a Fed system and there are Empire and Alliance systems within relatively short range as well.Great writeup OP. And you guys dont be shy to ask for help.

4856654,0,t1_cu4gnre,Yup a lot of us are using Voice Attack. Alternatively there is a freeware version called Vocals but it is not quite as stellar but is does work. Obviously these are for PC but with Windows  being injected into the Xbone platform there may be some sort of voice command software in the future for Xbone. The only issue I can see is that the Xbone software natively needs to already support voice input. The reason why Voice Attack works on PC is because Windows comes with voice recognition software already. Voice Attack just translates that to keybinds but relies on voice recognition to already be installed on your OS. Hopefully something similar comes out for you guys though as I cant imagine flying without it running in the background now.,EliteOne,cu6puu4,1,t5_38pmu

Just dont attack  of the  factions in  system in the galaxy. There are some on here that have been more vociferous about attacking players than I like and I will not do it myself unless pushed but everyone knows where they stand and its an entirely reasonable request. I was in a wing last night and there was an EXO pirate that we ignored and it made absolutely no difference to our income as there were plenty of others to attack. This is a real nonissue unless a pilot chooses to make it so by attacking EXO ships.

5248711,0,t1_cvhurpr,I do just fine as a dangerous champ! Ive already ran into him and his hired schoolyard bullyconda. Without even an official system response of any kind those kids playing cowboy attempted to murder an innocent pilot.Not before I attempted to see what kind of pilots they were at their core. Sure Im the master of my own destiny but I have a sense of justice. Right and wrong. So hovering in front of my very own stalker... I dropped my shields. With silent running in case what I suspected was true. Of course it was. This pilot and his goons... The ones that trumpet the justice of exo... Were nothing more than your typical wanna be gangster. Mind you it was a very civil meet. Running into him was like running into your very first pilot out in deep space. Only difference was I knew who he was. So in a meeting that couldve happened to anyone... These thugs fired as soon as they saw.Now why did I do that? Because one day I ran into a brand new first time pilot. During our exchange he tried to FA off flip over me and accidentally smacked his silent running button. He was completely mine. A near k bounty is tempting. Even if the guys a self admitted starry eyed new pirate.Of course I didnt fire. But I did do the same with this pilot. I hoped it would end up with me complain about how the current flight stickcontroller mapping makes me accidentally do silent running all the time during FA off... But it ended with bad news.That this pilot has misled many poor pilots. And the entire exo nation.If E.X.O is going to be the kind faction that has these kinds of goons calling it theirs then I want no part in it. Its no more corrupt than an old earth Mexican government. The cartel ran their racket. They could be the worst kind of human.If E.X.O wants to expand and become a true power...

5369550,0,t1_cvxwx7v,First   Levelling up qith the imperial navy. There are a total of  ranks within the imperial navy from outsider to king. As you rank up you unlock perks auch as a permit to Achenar the Imperial home world and the ability to purchase the Imperial Eagle Imperial Courier and the Imperial ClipperSecond  Mining can be profitable. It depends on your cargo capacity refinery and mining lasers. I also reccomend prospector and collector limpet controllers. The first decent ship for mining IMO is the ASP Explorer. The prospector limpet controller tells you the make up of the roid in  values. I tend to mine rocks that have over  platinum palladium and osmium over  gold over  silver and over  painite. Each rock will have    metals or minerals in it. You want to mine in Pristine metallic rings which have a total of  metals and minerals. This means you want a B refinery so you can process them all without having to vent anything. The nearest Pristine system with metallic rings is GCRV Collector limpets collect the fragments meaning you dont need to scoop them manually. Ideally you want to be able to have    limpets out at once meaning you need at least two class  controllers. Third  Tote Lembava  Piscium Diaguandri are all good outfitting locations very close to Wolf . None of these systems sell all modules so you may need to visit a few before you find what you are looking for. All of these systems offer a  discount to normal outfitting and shipyards because they are controlled or exploited by Li Yong Rui in the powerplay and that is one of his perks ,EliteOne,cvy0qnu,5,t5_38pmu

There is no overarching story line for you to play through where you are the hero the saviour of the peopleThe universe evolves around you the empire does what it does the feds do what it wants to damn dirty feds. You as the player can effect a system maybe two or three. but without the pull of alot of the player group we cannot change the course of the empirefederation which is done through community goals. There is one going on at the moment where people need to either support the empire one CG or oppose the empire a second CG and its basically a race. That being said there are plenty of mission on the BB bulletin Board that are accessible when you start in your sidewinder. Once you amass a few thousand credits you can start to upgrade your sidewinder. As for my first  hours they were full of lessons. blowing up when trying to dock getting killed by anacondas etc. the game has a massive learning curve but once you get through the first  hours or so you are well on your way to becoming elite!,EliteOne,cw1ll9c,3,t5_38pmu

6841947,0,t1_d0rswx9,Well its up to you whether you want to remain allied to your faction until you can upgrade ships but I would say its best to deal with interdictions headon when possible. The Asp Explorer when you can afford it is a very versatile ship. You can give her an iron ass and load up on weapons shields boosters and cell banks without sacrificing too much cargo capacity or maneuverability. Plus even when fully loaded shell give you well over  Ly jump range with an ARate FSD. That wont lessen the interdictions too much but at least you can kill most threats when they come.And like others have said the community goal at LHS  will bring a new station to the secondary star allowing future pilots to take care of business without the  Ls slog.And if you think that is bad Hutton Orbital is .

7650188,0,t1_d3brem0,Thank you for the detailed explanation on the history and reasoning.  I was unaware of a lot of that within the games history and its good to hear the why behind it all. I didnt know that FSD was still so new in the current year. Based on the development of the bubble I assumed it was at least  years considering out hulls can withstand the pull of the center of the galaxy. That was my main reason behind wondering why a single pilot can survive the monthlong trek there and back given time for other outside of gaming commitments with no issues but a huge group couldnt occupy a system ly out. This makes a lot of sense as to why its not feasible just yet. Thank you for taking the time to explain it.  You are good people. Fly safe CMDR. ,EliteOne,d3bs8d6,3,t5_38pmu

7905988,0,t1_d44ooe7,I do both but in a wing at least there are some other people to talk to and you get that  shared dividend bonus when turning in your sales at the commodities market. So we each get shared dough. Its really helpful when a new player or friend who is new to the game comes along. We all know how hard it is to get started and having one noob in the wing out there with us is great. We can kick him our junk like gold for limpets so we can load up on painite and he can make shuttles back and forth to the station selling the junk we kick out plus gets some dividends. Huge for someone just starting out to be able to move up in ships rapidly enough to be able to strike out on his own.  Having a friend help me out this way had me in a MKIV in no time.  From there I was able to move up and have helped as many new comers in out group that I can. When they first get started I often kick them platinum and palladium instead of gold so they can come up quicker and will help them in outfitting their ship so they can solo mine when no one from our decent sized group is on Now when I am soloing in my  strip mining there are often party invites and wings forming soon after for some good old drilling.,EliteOne,d44pig0,1,t5_38pmu

Before hearing this I was thinking of picking up a cronusmax anyway and see if I could use the macro programming to get more buttons.  With the button hold switches in the ED control scheme I counted  buttons available and thats probably enough for the hotas but dedicated keyboardmouse support would mean a lot easier programming of the cronusmax.

8011197,0,t3_4onjqt,I play in a Wing more often than not and have some things that I find works for us.You seem to have to be in the same instance AND locally close to your mate you want to wing with.For this reason we always meet up at a station. You then know that you are locally close so this is something that can be eliminated so if you cant see your friend on the Contacts list you know that you are both in different instances. You can also check your Com menu  if your friend is Local it should say here. If he isnt you wont be able to send a Wing RequestIf the above is true then you need to log off and back on again to try and force you to log into the same instance as your friend.This works most of the time  ONE of you stays logged in the then the others who want into the wing log off  save and exit to main menu. Load back into the Private Group and cehck for your friends in the ways mentioned above again.Now sometimes this may not work and I have a theory. When you log back on sometimes it loads in really quickly and you still cant find your friends. I think that it is some kind of quick load  you still have a space on the original instance.If this is the case you need to force it. I do this back hard quitting the app. i.e. dashboard and select quit Relaunch and go through the original steps.I have had success by Save and Exit to Main Menu load into Solo then quite and load in to the Private Group. I think going into Solo somehow ditches the incorrect instance. Hope this helps  it seems fairly flaky but we seem to manage  of the time using the above method.

8242325,0,t3_4s830w,The two front runners are GalCop and EG Pilots EG Pilots seems to be in first. Attempting to help anyone else at this point wont likely matter. You should note before going further GalCop seems to be in the headlines far more often than EG Pilots and normally being targeted by some players dislike of them. This makes it easier for me to talk about them.I havent looked deep into these groups but from what Ive seen GalCop seems to be accepting help from just about any group and supporting all styles of play. Unfortunately this has bothered a portion of the community because some more nefarious groups have been included within the support for the faction and this has been turned into claims that GalCop supports terrorists and whatnot. Its fairly ridiculous but understandable if they openly accept support from groups that have less reputable actions even if other players are taking it too far.EG Pilots hasnt been pushing their image as much from what Ive accidentally come across but seem to be working extremely hard to maintain a friendly appearance to all even their rivals. Its likely this attitude that garners them greater support from the community over GalCop.There is a decent amount of material out there on both of these groups if you want to look into them yourself.

Although at the moment a couple of those are waaaaay out at the extremely distant Jaques station towards the galactic center and when I say extremely I mean  hours of constant jumping and fuel scooping distant so that might be a bit far unless you feel like a major exploration trip.

Sure.  Should you disallow it within your own factions ranks?  Up to you if thats the role your faction plays in the galaxy.  If someone else wants to start a faction thats all piracy and murder thats fine too.  If all the other factions want to get stabby on that pirate faction for doing so also fine.  Your role in the game is up to you... and as a faction you set the standards and people of the same mindset can join... or not.So if EXO is meant to be honorable thats part of the role playing.  Play the good guy role and prohibit piracy amongst your own ranks.  If some of your members are intent on piracy then theyre free to form their own faction to do that.  Its all about freedom.

There were a few likely planets but I was lucky enough to pick the right one. Not so luckily I chose the opposite side of th planet to investigate when I got there. Oops. Still I didnt have far to go to get there. Its possible I was the first Xbox player to arrive but there was another guy posting on the thread on the Frontier forums who thought he might have been too but neither of us was expecially interested on arguing the case. Not like we got a prize for it or anything. But I was there no more than  minutes or so after it was found. It was... Pretty great. Id been following the hunt pretty closely over the weekend and even though it doesnt do anything it still felt like a real payoff to such an elaborate event. Its just so... Eerie. And then I got my SRV wedged behind it and had to self destruct. So... Really hoping nobody took that as a declaration of war or anything.

8931431,0,t1_d7ldpbf,Id really love if they invested some time into improving piracy in ED on the whole.I came from EvE where I was a pirate for many years and I think the  barrier to PvP piracy on Xbone is that communication between players ingame is severely limited. A true pirates greatest weapon is his silver tongue. The ability to talk a player into dropping the cargoloot you want  either by being funnyfun or threatening  is worth way more than combat ability. However in ED on Xbone player pirates are so limited in how and the speed at which they communicate that it almost always descends into gunplay.If FD isnt going to invest into improving that aspect of the game then itd be nice if they made NPC piracy a little better. For one thing limpets taking up cargo space or being seen as cargo is ridiculous. They should be considered dronelike and have drone bays or something similar. Also the fact that you cant reuse a limpet after its been deployed once is kind of silly. Itd also be nice to see them streamline the process of stealing cargo a bit. As of right now its like interdict gt cargo scan gt shoot shields gt shoot power plant without destroying target gt deploy hatch breaker gt deploy collector gt sit and wait to collect loot gt start over. IMO having all limpet types folded into one would be great. Also introducing some kind of EWAR to kill a PP without having to damage the target ship would be useful and probably make interactions in PvP piracy a bit less hostile.Sorry for the rant just a few offthecuff thoughts.,EliteOne,d7lfcqg,1,t5_38pmu

8992148,0,t3_53eow1, Yes I would recommend Horizons. It adds planetary landings SRV vehicle which is a ton of fun to drive around especially on low gravity worlds base assault missions and Engineers crank your ship up to  with awesome upgrades to all modules. One of the ways to get into Elite more is using one of the new background music apps available. They dont have to be snapped and you get to roll through the galaxy to your own custom soundtrack. Also I would recommend joining a player group if you are the social type as the communities that support Elite are second to none and make the game really great. Powerplay can be like that but it is really more of an end game thing to do as it will require a fairly decent combat ship for undermining or a decent cargo fit vessel not to mention disposable credit balance for fortifying and prep. In Powerplay you will also get shot at and interdicted absolutely everywhere so you will need to be on your toes even for the simplest tasks as long as you are pledged. It can be fun though its not for everyone. There have been a slew of updates added to the game in the last few months but too many to list so I will summarize. User Interface in stations has never been better especially when it comes to missions and outfitting so much info added. The game has also had a few upgrades to graphic detail and comms chatter around stations making things much more immersive. Those are the most notable IMO.Edited for spelling,EliteOne,d7spu6r,3,t5_38pmu

Saying they cant and wont do it until MS changes their policies and allows third party software.Here is the rub though...they are affiliated with FD already. They own the sound libraries. Why the hell are they relying on third party platforms?License the damn libraries to FD add an audio option to select AI voice and then map those sounds to audio queues in place of the default voice. It is the exact and I mean exact same concept and implementation as multilanguage support which there is already a framework for.Make it an official feature and stead of official work around.Sometimes I think these guys just dont like money.,EliteOne,d843d0r,6,t5_38pmu

I had worked my way up to a T Super heavy and was close to cashing out my chips and buying a condo on Mars with a view of Olympus Mons before my world came crashing down. Out of the black a team of vultures ripped me out of slipspace blasted my drives boarded and proceeded to execute my entire crew along with my love of three years Rebecca Mooney.

11773413,0,t1_dguhx1z, op Yes this may sound like the delete systems  thing but this is the current fix for that problem and all it does is reset your setting. Everything else is saved on Frontier servers. You have to press the start button on Elite Dangerous then go to manage game. Then find saved data and delete everywhere. Hope this helps.,EliteOne,dgujth0,3,t5_38pmu
