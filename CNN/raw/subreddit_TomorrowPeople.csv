299152,0,t1_cf892uo,Thanks Dorkside for pointing this out. A high school student in a sophisticated bar able to buy drinks with no problem.  Its a detail like this that really bugs me about the show.  The scene just didnt ring true.  I love the show but sometimes it seems amateurish.  ,TomorrowPeople,cfbru5f,2,t5_2wffs

677540,0,t1_cgha93v,True. I think what the IMDb ratings are telling us is that at least those viewers still think the episodes are worth seeing so it adds a dimension to the measurements of how the show is doing in my view.,TomorrowPeople,cghabuw,2,t5_2wffs
679034,0,t3_21xo2a,I think I actually enjoy her more now.  Then again I never understood the Cara hate to begin with so who knows.Most of her actions seem justified at least the way the story has been presented.  I mean she leaves home fairly young with the thought that her father is perfectly okay with it leaving behind a sister then gets in with some bad people where she is indirectly responsible for getting someone she more or less looked up to killed and then she meets John and all of a sudden shes running and hiding from an organization that wants to strip her and the other Tomorrow People of their powers or kill them.Seems like plenty of reason to be angry to me especially when it comes to humans.,TomorrowPeople,cghgg8v,3,t5_2wffs
