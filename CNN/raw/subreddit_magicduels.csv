4491575,0,t1_cswhcjo,Thanks for the info Chris but I cant help but think that things could have been handled slightly better in the runup to release. And dont get me wrong Im super excited for the Steam release... whenever that is. Im sure youll have seen it but if not take a look at TouchArcades initial impressions. I think that reviewer sums up what the majority of the userbase will feel. Why not put out a statement before release saying things along the following lines posted to twitter FB on the official Duels site and most importantly here on reddit Magic Duels has been submitted to the iOS app store. We are targeting a July th edit wrote th first oops release date pending smooth submission through Apple. For reasons xyz although I have no idea what these could possibly be we are implementing a one week exclusive on the iOS store with release on Steam and Xbox one week later. As stated previously PS will hit in August. Due to technical constraints Magic Duels will only be compatible with iOS versionsiPads versions xyz insert your tech info Whilst we are very sorry that at this stage earlier devices are not supported we are a small development team and at this stage this is simply the only way we could ensure getting the product out on time. Rest assured that we are looking into options to make this backwards compatible surely that is a possibility in time Regarding crossplatform play we also understand the frustration that the lack of this feature means. This is something we are deeply aware of and again are actively looking into for the future. We understand and you really should that crossplatform play and synchronised accounts are incredibly important to the community and will strive to rectify this in the future but for now there are the aforementioned limitations in place.The last point is really the most important. This has the potential to make or break Duels as a viable sustainable product.I know this post is getting long but on a positive note the good bit of marketing that was done was the delivery of a Steam key to pcgamesns Nick. This generated a lot of hype and it was a real joy to watch him play from the start. Look at HS before that release. People were clamouring for beta keys going into frenzies on reddit when new keys were handed out. HS rocketed up twitch views because of the hype this all generated. That ensured that were several massive steps ahead before things were even properly releasedfully into closed beta let alone open beta and release.,magicduels,cswtnph,4,t5_38f9b

4525775,0,t3_3d25ll,They doesnt seem to care. Most of the playerbase will be on a constant grind from expansion to expansion unless they will spend some . It doesnt seem that bad to me after giving it some thought only thing i dont like about it is that they clearly LIED to us stating before that there will be no cap. My only concern is that we might have to pay for the expansions itself which i hope wont be the case. If that WOULD be the case game would be horribly unappealing for new players after just  expansions. If someone starts playing from the very beginning or around st expansion it should still be ok to have a decent collection without that much effort. ,magicduels,ct141ii,1,t5_38f9b

4562239,0,t1_ct5ogk5,Is that supposed to somehow counter my argument? Seriously? Blizzard promoted hearthstone on other Blizzard websites but thats not what really sold us on the game now is it? No it was getting involved with the community having multiple stages of beta sending out invites to popular streamers and youtubers advertising on TV and other gaming websites etc. Wizards on the other hand has done barely anything not even giving a legit release date for what is probably going to be the main platform the PC. Having an ad Wizards website barely does anything.

4570463,0,t3_3djp0h,I cant speak to the iOS version because I havent seen exactly how the UI is set up but I know in Magic  it only prompted mana selection if I activated an ability on a zoomedin card.

4584933,0,t1_ct8iqrh,This is not universally correct.You are talking about pseudo random number generators and of course they are generated by an not necessarily deterministic algorithm.But there is also the possibiltiy to rely on true random numbers which are most commonly gained by physical experiments for example the fluctuation in the power of a beam of light or atmospheric noise. Since we dont know how Wizards approached the random number generation it is pure speculation to say there has to be a formula.If you want to read more about this try random.org or as an example of an application which uses true random numbers look up the QuantumRoll mechanic of roll.net based on this trng.Edit fixed link,magicduels,ct8j4rt,1,t5_38f9b
4591814,0,t1_ct9a4gz,That does seem like it would make a lot of sense. As mentioned by others vs A.I. seems like a pretty good thing to do as far as learning in a low pressure environment although what I actually think you would be doing is getting used to the strategies to grossly over simplify the game is knowing what you can do predicting what your opponent can do and then acting on that knowledge. The deck build helper gives a pretty decent slide show of ways you can try to win. Knowing your strategy and predicting your opponents helps you make better decision as you have some idea of what you can afford to give up at any point in the game and what would hinder you opponent the most some fairly straight forward examples are things like how aggressive decks would prefer to trade damage early while controlling decks would rather trade their early creatures. If you want to start making decks from scratch I would recommend starting with a strategy in mind and evaluating your cards in that frame of mind so your decks are focused you could also start by picking a card to build around but even then you really trying to figure out the best strategy that includes that card. Things that can give you some deck building help are knowing the colour identities which helps you pick the best colours for the desired deck style the magic the gathering vanilla test for comparative creature assessment the magic the gathering quadrant theory for cards and you know pay attention to your mana curve generally  ish lands with a roughly bell curve shaped mana cost centered around  with exceptions. All of these little techniques can be replaced by experience I just find they give you a nice starting point. I hope this helps. ,magicduels,ct9e5cm,2,t5_38f9b

I think their game plan is to ease new players in with an easy to understand card pool and then start increasing the complexity and power of the meta as expansions are added. I imagine Battle for Zendikar will swing the pendulum back toward powerful spells. How else are we going to stop the invading Eldrazi?    As for what decks are powerful?

Maybe theres a burn deck Im unaware of but I certainly would be looking for Essence Scatter over either of them.Orb I can see and maybe Obliteration although that effect is always overrated and again punishes a control deck far more heavily than an aggro deck because it can strip the wincon.

OP was talking about popularity of Duels amp whether thus it warranted another expansion a decision up to Wizards.uFedu shifted the question to whether expansion serves more to keep players around or more to draw new ones in.  Its easy to say both but really how Wizards implements it can easily focus on one part over another e.g. look at the crappy new D stuff Wizards decided to give us as part of the BFZ expansion.  Ultimately the topic is still what will Wizards do with its expansions wrt to its customers.So if you are willing to compare Hearthstone to Duels you may as well talk about how Wizards isnt drawing in and retaining players through expansions like how Blizzards is doing with expansions for Hearthstone.,magicduels,d01np7o,1,t5_38f9b

7747479,0,t1_d3mfav1,All digital products have to compromise Magics rules system because that system is optimised for paper tournament play. Theres no way to have the shortcuts and professional judge calls and acceptance of minor nonfunctional game errors that paper Magic allows.Besides which the redirection rule is a compromise in order to make old cards work without errata a proper digital game would simply errata the existing cards but Magic tries to avoid that where possible as noone wants to check oracle  times a game.I personally feel they should minismise the rules discrepancies by not printing cards that highlight them but when youre quoting the planeswalker redirection rule they can safely assume that youre capable of handling a few minor discrepancies. And if not MTGO is right there.If enough interactions like Fall of the Titans and Sigarda start to screw up because of this the way Id solve it would be to have you target the planeswalker but have the targeting line go via the player but this is exposing additional complexity for no significant benefit and as you start down that path you quickly end up with a system as clunky as MTGO.,magicduels,d3mty8h,2,t5_38f9b

8376193,0,t3_4u9f47,They just need to give us modern masters  set and that would allow us to play modern after rotation. So we would be able to use all regular sets  modern masters as modern format in duels and standard would be like in paper. Maybe introduction of block format is more needed that would allow new players to play with equal chances against older players with just set or two unlocked. With time Barrier for new players would be harder to breach because they would be behind in some moment  or  sets. If we have no rotation out or smaller limited formats new players would need year of grinding or lot of money to have all cards. Im aware that you dont need to have all cards to play competitive matches.  Having  sets allow us to create decent decks for competitive Vs matches but it is discouraging when you just start game and confront player who have all cards from all sets. With new quests that prioritize Vs matches new players are in even bigger problem. Sure many of new quests do not request wins in Vs but quest reward is not enough motivation for spending  hour of time  playing matches which you will probably lose. ,magicduels,d5oknyr,2,t5_38f9b

Duels is flipping free and you can have all the cards for FREE if you put in the effort something you wont find in any other format.

I cant cast the nonLand Cards in my hand only the Land has the red highlight. And the only Permanents with the red highlights are Sinister Concoction and Westvale Abbey.

Especially if you start out with your Starter Box playing against any Planeswalker on an even board state pretty much means you should scoop right that instant instead of wasting your time losing a slow and painful battle. Planeswalkers are already too hard to kill in the regular paper Standard but they are an absolutely overpowered nightmare on Magic Duels. They didnt even bother including Ruinous Path in the Zendikar set which lets the balance just go further down the drain. I can imagine it is not as dramatic in the later stages of the game when youve completed several sets but in the beginning it is just extremely aggrevating and frustrating if your opponent draws his planeswalker and you dont as long as you are not significantly ahead anyways your opponent will outvalue you in record time.

10626687,0,t1_ddc1cml,True but you usually do not need more than  sources of color on battlefield. With  color deck in Duels you achieve that faster than with  colors.  basics is insanity for  color devoted decks. You are more likely to get color screwed and draw only one color. You can of course take mulligan but with that ratio it is great chance that you will not draw enough lands or right colors. It is most risky to play  color with that much basics than  color with duals. It could maybe be fine for mono color  splash deck.But let for moment take that what you are saying is correct and really get you advantage. Lets look all mana bases on grand prix and pro tour decks. Why there is no one like you are suggesting?Rule is whenever good dual lands available use them. You tweak mana base  including or excluding some of them but most likely you will use most of dual lands available. EDITWhy you do not see problem with that mana base it is because certain cards in that colors allows archetypes that have lot of profit of non offensive usually draw card spells. That works only because your draw spells triggers effects adn support other cardslike having extra card to discard due madness or triggering tutelage or prowes creatures or  that untaps or charging aetherflux reservoir. However if you try to make deck with same mana base that relies on creatures that mana base would show weaknesses. For example we have possibility to build very good evasive deck with UR. It can be supplied with few draw cards few removals maybe few counter spells. You can make great flyer creature deck that is very resistant on opponent removals  and very reactive deck. However it only works if you have luck to cover your mana early in game. It really need that all land drops from  be untapped and you need to have UU on turn . With  duals that could be possible with  only sometimes.,magicduels,ddc289a,0,t5_38f9b

10653385,0,t1_ddcmwbh,gtGaeas Revenge is another card from Origins thats quite effective against Planeswalkers  their only outs are Oath of Liliana while you have no other creatures Planar Outburst or multiple Languish type effects.Unfortunately the introduction and prevalence of Blessed Alliance GREATLY reduced the effectiveness of Gaeas Revenge in my experienceunlike Celestial Flare Blessed Alliance is a playable card. Revenge used to be one of my favorite anticontrol cards but Blessed Alliance is an extremely powerful answer to it unless you can consistently attack with another creature alongside it which is not the case in the places you really need Gaeas Revenge in the first place. ,magicduels,ddetc7g,1,t5_38f9b

10920580,0,t3_5w08az,Id say yes and no.Creatures decks arent so beginner friendly unlike what many people are thinking. Im not an expert in magic too but i think creatures need more mindgame and strategy than it seems. I guess beginners tend to play creatures the most because they see them as a brutal force that needs to be accumulated on battlefield and thrown on enemys face when ready. The fact is when you play creatures you have to think about enchants combat tricks synergy and timing way more than when you play blast or removal spamming.In my werewolves deck for example that is far from being one of the hardest to play its often about casting an instant buff at the very last time to get trample and like  damage to win. Although it doesnt seem very complicated i usually need to prepare it by fainting a desperate attack or sacrificing creatures. Sometimes I also need to take damage whitout blocking nor attacking for several rounds so i can have everything ready. Im trying to think about how i will play my creatures in the next  rounds that is pretty hard especially with the random factor of magic. Even blue players that are often considered as the most subtle ones dont always need to think so much. That said youre right about the strongest ones and i must admit i rarely play stronger creatures than  whitout buffs because there are too many destroying spells in this game that dont consider the creature stamina so you can lose your  like a  and have all your mana wasted. Your observation is even more true in v because there are way too many blasts and controls in a round to allow you keeping your creatures on battlefield and you often lack synergy or support from your partner to make your strategy efficient.i dont speak english sorry for mistakes,magicduels,de6dqfv,4,t5_38f9b

11023222,0,t3_5xabw9,I dont really agree. I am very very happy that they finally have a continuous story line with characters that you can become familiar with. I played a lot of Odyssey back in the day but I had no idea who Kamahl Chainer Jeska or Aboshan really were. Let alone which of them were friends and which were enemies. And when I got my hands on the books it turned out they were absolutely terrible. I was also surprised to find that Kamahl and Chainer were friends... the whole story was mostly lost on me. I was still looking for Phyrexians and Gerrard. I also did not feel much impetus to go and find out because there was going to be another story in the next block. The same is the case with a lot of the following planes who knows really why the spirits on Kamigawa were fighting the mortals? And how did it end? What was going on on Ravnica other than there were ten guilds who had conflicts? What exactly was Rhys doing on Lorwyn? And what did have Ashling and Oona to do with it? I bet that even some storygurus here would have to go and look it up again.On the other hand we know Chandra. We know she has a mother and that they reunited on Kaladesh. We know that Gideon is from Theros and that he is invulnerable. We know that Jace messes with peoples minds and that he is from Vryn where he was taught by a Sphinx.I bet that if you went and asked people who played a lot of older magic like Odyssey basic questions like are Kamahl and Chainer friends or enemies? or what artifact made all the people in Onslaught block go weird? a lot of people would have no clue. On the other hand I also think that a lot of people now know the answers to much deeper questions like what did Gideon do that he feels so guilty about? if you asked Jace to name his parents what would he say? or why did Nahiri get Emrakul to Innistrad?. I think that is really awesome. I have always loved how Magic cards could tell stories. I loved Tempest and I spent hours trying to figure out the Odyssey story line from the cards only to be totally disappointed and confused. I love what they are doing with the Gatewatch. I love that I can say with confidence that I love Chandra think Nissa is okay Gideon is a bit of a dork Lilianna is cool although I would never want to be anywhere near her and I would love to have Jace as a friend. Thats a lot more than I like Kamahl because he has a cool big sword and a bald head. Having said all that yes the Gatewatch could use a little resistance. They really dont need to emerge victorious every block. I think one problem is that often the bad guys are trying to destroy the plane they are on. And Magic has a bit of a history of creating really awesome and interesting settings and then destroying them you cant imagine how disappointed I was when I was all enamored with the forest of Argoth in Urzas Saga block only to find out that the reason it was in the story was because it was destroyed. So Amonkhet might actually be one where the Gatewatch lose because its Bolas plane so hes probably going to be the one defending it. So maybe Bolas can win but noone gets killed. I would be really sad if we love one of the Gatewatch people.  ,magicduels,dehgafq,6,t5_38f9b

11553756,0,t3_64qulm,Interesting question. I am a returning player after a  years hiatus from paper magic. It was actually Hearthstone that brought me back to playing CCG. I quickly grew tired of the game though and missed the depth and art of MGT. So when Duel arrived on steam they did a fair amount a publicity I was quite happy to be able to return to Magic and play. After a while I wanted the full game experience and also to play limited which is the format I prefer. So I gave a try to MTGO and could not believe how poor of an experience this was. So I will not touch this software again. I then attended a few events at the LGS draft prerelease etc. It became quickly repetitive though as it the same people are always there I mean always there even if I try to mix it up and go on a wednesday evening always the same people winning etc. I guess its fair to say I did not enjoy the crowd there plus the play environment is not great either. I am aware that this is a local phenomenon though as I now play paper Magic when I am out of town and I am often able to find nice clean play environments with a more diverse attendance than at my LGS. So this is how I play MTG now mostly Duel and limited from time to time if there is a nice store to play at. I am very interested in the Magic Digital Next and hope that it live up to the expectations. ,magicduels,dg5medy,1,t5_38f9b

11643852,0,t1_dgftejx,Commit bounces their tutelage into their deck before Memory shuffles it. Cast Out is also good tech in a format where killing creatures doesnt always get rid of them embalm and it hits enchantments too. Its a shame we didnt get Forsake the Worldly.,magicduels,dgfueka,1,t5_38f9b
11723136,0,t1_dgotgdz,gtIm not so sure youre  because youre in the large minorityActually you are. Most people understand variance.gtIn fact if it was there wouldnt be any controversy over it.The only controversy is in your head because there isnt one.gtHow on earth could that possibly be confirmation bias? Its the exact opposite.I have yet to see more than a handful of people thinking there is something wrong with the randomizer. so it is confirmation bias.gtAnd the people who bring it up the most are some of the most experience players. Thats not a coincidence.Ive top ed a GP and Im not complaining. Id love to see all of the experienced duels players complaining because I know most of them and they are not complaining. gtAnd just because something APPEARS to be simple and easy doesnt mean it is. It might be simple to a genius and tough for the laymanI think in the US you start learning about probability in nd grade? You dont have to be a genius to understand variance and randomness. gtAnd no I wasnt implying that mtgos method of shuffling is better because it hands out perfect hands to people. I was stating that they are committed to making it as random as possible making it a better shuffler because of that. I cant even right now. Randomness is randomness there is no way to make it better than randomize these  cards. Anything other than that is not random.Now I ask you to back up your claim. Why dont you go collect some data on starting hands in MD. Something like  hands with a  land deck  with   with  and  with  sounds good. If youre not going to provide data than its really just going on your word and thats not good enough based on your claims. even a sample size of  hands is small but I think that data and analysis is going to trump any argument here. Hell I will even help you I am sure I could round up at least a few people to put this nail in the coffin once and for all. ,magicduels,dgouiyi,3,t5_38f9b
11723191,0,t3_677xds,I would suggest either dropping your superfriends or dropping your mill. Your deck is not as fast or consistent as a true mill deck and not as controllysafe as a true superfriends deck. Youre cutting the power of both decks in order to hybrid their win conditions.Your mill package means youve reduced your blockersremovalboard wipes that would keep your planeswalkers safe. Your planeswalkers slow down the game ending potential of your mill package.Lastly several of your win conditions conflict. Tutelage and dynavolt tower gain very little benefit from planeswalker plays while planeswalkers cant be kept alive by tutelage and dont trigger dynavolt tower energy gain.,magicduels,dgour1l,3,t5_38f9b

11765122,0,t3_67mp2c,Weird thing with Censor...you actually have to pause the timer in order to use it as a counter spell. Unpaused when you click this card in respose to something it asks you to cycle it. HAVE to pause. Not sure but I think cast out is the same. So watch out for all cycling cards if you dont want to cycle them,magicduels,dgtlufy,1,t5_38f9b
