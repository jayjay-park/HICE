4069238,0,t3_376ltb,Here is a link to the original submissionHere is a comment by the original submitter Photograph by Neil LeiferampgtWell I was lucky. I dont want to sound like Im just being modest .. The photographer you see between Alis legs is Herbie Scharfman the other Sports Illustrated photographer. It didnt make a difference how good he was that night. He was obviously in the wrong seat. What the good sports photographer does is when it happens and youre in the right place you dont miss. Whether thats instinctual or whether its just luck I dont know.About the phantom punchampgtformer FBI agent William F. Roemer Jr. said We learned that there very definitely had been a fix in that fight. He said Bernie Glickman a boxing manager from Chicago with mob ties claimed that while he was conversing with Liston and his wife before the fight Listons wife told the exchampion that as long as he had to lose the fight he should go down early to avoid any chance of getting hurt. ... Mark Kram of Sports Illustrated said Liston told him That guy Ali was crazy. I didnt want anything to do with him. And the Muslims were coming up. Who needed that? So I went down. I wasnt hit.I am a robit,ImagesOfHistory,crk4dgo,1,t5_2yegu
