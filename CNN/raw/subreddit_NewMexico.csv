11098157,0,t1_depw4qq,I know people who have more success with deer but Ive always found elk easier to hunt. And Im not sure about draw odds but Ive seen a more elk than deer. A few reasons I think they are easier to hunt Elk are easier to spot bigger brown as opposed to grey  You can call to them have them call back to you dependent on the time of year They are heavier and leave clearer tracks One thing Id say is dont worry to much about successfully harvesting. It takes time to get good at hunting and the better the unit the less your change of drawing in it. ,NewMexico,depyswz,2,t5_2raxc
