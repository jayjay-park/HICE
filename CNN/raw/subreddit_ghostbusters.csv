You are conflating box office with quality by that basis Michael Bay has made the finest films of all time you assume that there not being as many prominent female comedians is because women are not as good instead of guys....running most of the creative industrys.... and you said women are not as funny as men. That is very different from saying there are more male comedians.I can sense this is going to turn into some kind of weird anti feminism....thing....And I really cannot be bothered with that.

3042817,0,t1_cod36zl,I had a seriously hard time listening to these guys shout their opinions at the top of their lungs constantly interrupting each other with nothing to say. None of them seem to know anything about how films are made.  Everyone wants to be Maddox and these guys prove that when you cant hack it its seriously irritating.As a member of the VFX community I will concede that it IS a safe bet that many effects that could be achieved practically will be achieved instead with CGI.  Im not the first person to observe that a huge part of the comedy came from the practical ghosts and other effects.  I dont think Slimer could be as funny animated in D.  Theres something about the performance you get from a foam latex puppet operated simultaneously by a handful of performers that made it so perfect.  The optical printing process also gave the films effects a unique thumbprint characteristic to that period in film.While I agree that its not fair to pass judgement so early I will say that it is likely there will be a fair amount of CG in this movie and it is understandable to anticipate being turned off by that on a personal level.  For me I would be very sad to see CG ghosts replace puppets especially considering how far animatronics have come.  If you want to picture how good practical ghosts could look with modern puppeteering techniques watch The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or the Hellboy movies.  There were some seriously great puppets in those films.,ghostbusters,coddy4n,2,t5_2qhz3

4507280,0,t1_csyjou9,A Feig Apologist eh? Thats funny. Guess you havent seen anything else Ive posted around here. Im the one who called Bridesmaids a bigger pile of shit than the one taken by the bride in the street in the movie and that I wouldnt go to a Paul Feig movie if I were given a pair of free tickets. That this reboot is a FeigMcCarthy joint is an extreme disappointment to me after twentyfive years of waiting. Nevertheless this train has left the station. Sony has been hurting for some time and desperately needs a tentpole franchise. Its strategy is to try work with the comedic sensibility and cast that has made Paul Feig a consistent box office success for the last half a decade or so. Doing that meant that the studio had to take a hard look at demographics and decide who they wanted to appeal to. We lost. The studio bet on what must have appeared to be a sure thing in favour of doing something different that is more in line and continuity with the original films. And I am quite certain the trappings of the Ghostbusters concept isnt going to make this new film any closer in tone to the original than is The Heat or Bridesmaids. Once it started filming I accepted that this is the reality for the franchise going forward. There are those among the fanbase who feel that anything Ghostbusters is better than nothing and others who feel it is better to stay optimistic. If we are speaking honestly virtually no one among the longstanding fanbase is actually excited about the direction Sony has taken. But I do feel that I ought to give credit where credit is due even if I dont like the direction overall. And shitting on everything having to do with the project would just make me look bad and play into this bullshit PR campaign Sony has spun about sexist manchildren not wanting a female team. Where something looks decent I dont see the harm in calling it out as such. But that doesnt change the fact that I have no intention to see the film unless there is a surge of overwhelmingly positive feedback from longstanding ghostheads.Edit typoEdit  The banner for this sub should be remade as a Ghostbusters Civil War theme.

6488727,0,t1_czqgyur,I generally dont put too much stock in the rumours about the project either. That said were not all that far away from the film being released. This should be Sonys doordie attempt to establish a much needed tentpole franchise especially since it had to go back to Marvel with its tail between its legs to get Spiderman working. But wheres the hype or excitement? This is the return of one of the most iconic film franchises of them all. Even a bythenumbers sequel like Ghostbusters II would probably be pretty wellreceived after this long a time with the right cast and universe feel. Just ask JJ Abrams. So Im convinced that Sony is having serious buyers remorse when it comes to Feig. He went his own way and made the Ghostbusters movie that he wanted to make. I have no problem with that. My problem is with Sony which moved heaven and earth to get him to direct without caring that the dirt it was shovelling got dumped on many of the people it should have been listening carefully to  the ones who didnt want a hard reboot and werent particularly interested in a FeigMcCarthy take on Ghostbusters. ,ghostbusters,czqhdzn,9,t5_2qhz3

They provide a kiss ass puff piece because this is a high profile project that draws readers to the website. As to the lying it was a bit of an exaggeration to pull in a reference to Venkmans line about voters in Ghostbusters II that was based on how officious the introduction was. And this trailer isnt going to put any of the controversy surrounding this project in the rearview mirror. So the statement is objectively false. A polite mistruth works better I suppose. However the fact that the debate has intensified means that the statement is factually inaccurate. The same could be said about the evoking the sensibility of the world. I for one dont think gross out humour is in keeping with the original two films at least not to the extent of the vomiting scene. Be we can agree to disagree on that one. Look you seem very put off by a comment that was half made in jest about something that you obviously take very seriously. If this new take works for you great. But I for one am not interested in any film that just happens to feature proton packs and the logo. What is missing from the trailer is the wit and tone that made the first two films special. The fact of it having proton packs and the same high concept does not make it in keeping with the others.

6859300,0,t1_d0tpnk0,Personally? Well personally I would look at the evidence available to me and I would form a hypothesis that required the least amount of extra leaps and unevidenced assumptions. In this situation it seems much more likely to me that the reason for minor discrepancies in the OPs recall of the film is due to the fact that he watched it at work was partially distracted and sometimes people forget things. That is a simple explanation that makes sense. It is a far less simple explanation is to conclude that OP has taken it upon himself to undertake a complicated creative writing project requiring multiple sources of reseach with no particularly evident motive for him taking the time to do so. ,ghostbusters,d0tt746,1,t5_2qhz3
6862340,0,t3_49qn7d,Heres my pitch. Explaining the characters firstA. After the successes in New York Ghostbusters began to set up in other locations training new people. A was one of the best and was sent to what was expected to be one of the key locations for ghostbusting activity New Orleans. However so much of New Orleans runs on the tourism that the spectral nature of the city that it meets backlash across the board from the tourist industry and the city government. As stubbornness to be defeated keeps A in charge of the New Orleans bureau rather than trying to move to a more productive location but has gotten increasingly bitter as New Orleans has become the stationed location for those that cant find a place somewhere better. The oldest of the team by some amount and also the one in charge.  B. Far more often correct than right B had joined an international location in London. Very bookish and detail oriented B provides for a great source of knowledge elements seen from both Ray and Egon but can easily lose focus on the big picture when focused on those details. B was moved to New Orleans after being unceremoniously forced out of London the city not the Ghostbusters franchise after explicit orders that while trying to capture a ghost at Westminster under no conditions could Big Ben be harmed. When one clockface was blown out in an explosion the argument that Big Ben is just the bell and that was undamaged and B had only damaged the Tower of the Palace of Westminster not Big Ben was not considered a satisfactory explanation.  C. C ended up in New Orleans due to circumstances beyond their control. A NorCal native C approached things with a laid back slightly new age attitude while working with the local Ghostbusters franchise. Ghostbusters San Francisco had had a shaky start however faced constant pressure to shut down from an organization formed at UC Berkeley that considered the capture of ghosts to be a rights violation. When the city of San Francisco declared that the capture and imprisonment the location was shut down and the members moved to various locations that had space.  D. The only one that lacks a real aptitude for whats going on D is former military that had served in Iraq before being discharged. Then was a police officer before being asked to leave the force. Then was a security guard for a few weeks until the mall asked D to not return to their premises. Ghostbusters was the last thing that came with a uniform and something like a gun. D follows the orders given but comes at it as though its a war not science. Getting on the Ghostbusters team only ever happened because of the ramshackle nature of the New Orleans franchise and beggars not being choosers.  Casting ideas based on my own ideas of who can be funny for the roles  A. Jane Curtin  B. David Mitchell maybe Richard Ayoade  C. Aisha Tyler or Trevor Moore  D. No idea,ghostbusters,d0u5mp8,0,t5_2qhz3

The same kind of vitriolic hate and fury that many are expressing on Facebook and such?You wont find any such official positions from fan sites because of their unique positions. If they say the movie is the worst thing since the Star Wars prequels they risk alienating members or even possibly courting Sonys wrath. They risk the same follower exodus if they go the other way.For what its worth Im an active GBFans member and I follow a good majority of the various fan groups on Facebook.

Most fake plots dont make sense to me especially how he revealed how the Logo ghost would be used. I havent seen that leaked anywhere else on the internet besides by him and that would have taken a lot of reverse engineering for him to have thought up how they were going to do it because the writers came up with the idea organically.

For us we just needed to plant a flag and go Heres kind of how some of the stuff in the movie is! But....he did just flip the genders of every character...i would have dismissed all of that and agreed with him but he failed that  simple obvious motive of progression if he simply made Black Actress a Scientist instead of her simply being an embarrisingly  sterotyped Winston Zeddemore and what pisses me off is Ernie Hudson had a swagger about him in the original where his ethnicity wasnt who he was or needed to be amplified to remind you Hes The Black one he was the straight man with real comedic moments and actual great dialoge especially when him and ray were alone just talking about religon.

8329176,0,t3_4tklyf,How she was treated was despicable nothing justifiable in any manner I wont even attempt to salvage some sort of explanation.However what would be the basis of filtering out hate speech? Thats a very messy can of worms.First wed have to delineate the offending behavior  Would it require bigotry? Would it require continued persistent contact despite an express communication to cease? Does it require ganging up? If these are the sufficient elements then Ive seen a lot of people whove exhibited such behavior while ostensibly arguing in favor of BLM and other such legitimate causes. It would be both unfair and confusing to us all if bigotry against minorities were filtered but not the most edgy progressives who often provoke using bigotry.  Second what would filter actual be? How would that work? Blocking ISPs? That would never work Its easy to get a new ISP and if tried a lot of people wholly innocent would be affected For instance someone who shares a residence with the offender. Again its horrible that Leslie Jones was the target of unquestionable hate but I wont sign any petition until these issues are at least somewhat resolve or the filtering shown to be the only way to protect innocents and all the good that can come from filtering clearly outweighs the incidental bad.,ghostbusters,d5ipafu,9,t5_2qhz3

Or in the case of a film bombing no one gets anything anyway.Id assume in this case it was a mix of  and  I think Sony gave them a payout amount for some sort of ongoing deal going forward that lets Sony play with Ghostbusters as they see fit while giving the original crew some input and a level of ongoing financial compensation based off the projects they do. ,ghostbusters,d5k4o65,1,t5_2qhz3

8855871,0,t1_d7bu12h,Im going to play pop psychologist for a bit. Ive got a pretend diploma on my wall I drew it up myself.Feig I think said somewhere that he didnt care much for the first movie. So he presumably did see it.Heres where the psychology bit comes in I think he has contempt issues. He feels contempt for other men and he feels contempt for other movies but in particular he feels contempt for better men and better movies. He puffs his ego up by sneering at people who are more creative original and productive than he is.Im guessing he probably feels contempt for The Mask too but that didnt stop him from ripping off Cuban Pete. He is not an original thinker he copies. When he has a script he has the camerman point the camera in one direction and tells him to shoot. Thats why he fell apart trying to shoot a more complex scene his usual sitcom technique of stealing ideas couldnt transform him into Spielberg overnight. Its too obvoius even in normal action scenes that he cant see them ahead of time. Hes the envyriddled director of a high school play who somehow wormed his way into a major movie production and a  million payday.Critics have explained away this tendency of his by describing him as a parodist of some sort but what he does is not parody. When he has Melissa McCarthys head twisting around like Linda Blair he is not parodying The Exorcist hes repeating the same gag hes seen in other movies that were doing a parody of The Exorcist. Feig is not lampooning or paying tribute to Young Frankenstein when he presents a watereddown version of Marty Feldmans head gag. He is merely ripping off a joke that he remembers was funny but he does not have the skill to understand why it was funny the first time. The only reason it creates any kind of laugh now is the gift to Feig idiots who will laugh at anything just because its random.And of course that brings us to Rowan our lowrent Marshmallow Man. Why is he even that big? Because Staypuft was. Why then arent all ghosts that huge? Who knows? Feig is just busy copying stuff he doesnt understand then patting himself on the back for his lame variations by calling them billion dollar ideas.For that matter nobody nobody has been able to explain why he suddenly acquires the red bow tie. Feig probably just figured it needed something extra no logic or reasoning required.,ghostbusters,d7ccmja,32,t5_2qhz3
