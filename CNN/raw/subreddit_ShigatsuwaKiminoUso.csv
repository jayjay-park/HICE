4396135,0,t1_csl0qwv,so for me its actually not whether it was really that good or not. I see a ton of posts stating reasons why they dont like it or how nodame cantabile is the superior show. While those may all be valid points for me there is just something special about the fact that it was the VERY FIRST anime that i watched and that I got really emotionally into. For me I only have so much emotional currency that i can spend and invest with. I have already spent it on shigatsu so now there is just no way any other anime will ever have the really hard hitting effect. Even if a show is better in terms of plot art music etc. it wont and cant ever affect me the same way shigatsu did because i already spent the emotional currency on the feelz of shigatsu. And i only  have so much emotional currency. once i spend it i can never get it back and it never regenerates,ShigatsuwaKiminoUso,csl6hd2,1,t5_32lnc

6313884,0,t3_422gcy,I used commie and it worked great in VLC Media player. It glitched on my K smart TV though on the last episode. ,ShigatsuwaKiminoUso,cz7bha3,2,t5_32lnc
6322825,0,t1_cz88fue,Its from the Finale live event  There were performances of all the OPs and EDs live readings of scenes by the VAs performances of character songs Risa Taneda Saori Hayami Ayane Sakura and Ai Kayano all performed their character songs and performances of some the major musical pieces i.e. Koseis and Kaoris by the artists who actually performed them for the show.,ShigatsuwaKiminoUso,cz8c3s4,1,t5_32lnc
7076132,0,t1_d1h8qx7,Does the soundtrack only have  tracks? The complete ost has  tracks I believe so does that mean between the two volumes we wont be getting the full ost?Im really big into soundtracks especially for shigatsu which has the best ost of anime imo.,ShigatsuwaKiminoUso,d1ifz2v,1,t5_32lnc
7624158,0,t3_4jqe50,Every anime has emotions flow freely and has aspects of it exaggerated. YLIA is not unique in this. Each of the characters fall into standard anime archetypes. Kosei is the shy introverted hard worker Kaori is boisterous and loud cheerful type Tsubaki is the nagging friend and Watari is confident popular guy. Anime characters in general are quite different from real japanese people. You want an anime which shows its characters without falling for stereotypes then watch Aku no Hana.   ,ShigatsuwaKiminoUso,d38tr1c,1,t5_32lnc

11639963,0,t1_dgf6giy,which isnt my cup of tea.. it just feels too generic kind of romance story without any special of it.. ofc most of the live action adaptation is made to cover up people who arent into anime.. But i just wont recommend the live action to first watcher eventhough theyre not someone into anime.. As you said i also understand why they should cut it to fit the H duration.. thats why the live action version isnt really fit with this kind of story.. In my opinion even if they want to adapt it to live action it shouldnt be like other movie format.. Probably made it live action with serial series is better.. Which also means that they cant put it on cinemas which is also another problem..,ShigatsuwaKiminoUso,dgfeiwn,1,t5_32lnc
11728786,0,t3_67crpx,That was very nice thanks for sharing.  Well done!Only real feedback is that it would be nice to get many different angles of playing the guitar in the video ha ha.I wish I could nail Kirameki as well as you did Orange here.  I got it down pat all the way up to the chorus and then I just cant keep up with the complex fingerings in the chorus part hahah.  One day though.  ,ShigatsuwaKiminoUso,dgphlfn,2,t5_32lnc
