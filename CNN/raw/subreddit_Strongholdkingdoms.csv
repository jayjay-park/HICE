199731,0,t3_1wctkw,This game isnt pay to win per se but its basically if you spend money you get a big advantage.  At the end of the day the best players win.  Ive always payed for premium play and never paid for cards but I get the  free cards each day and I get tons of cards from doing quests this allows me to still play a decent amount of cards.  I am currently holding my own pretty well against a pretty heavy carder whos hell bent on taking my county on Domination.There is a guy on this server who spends a ridiculous amount of money but hes still losing the war.  The advantages he gains doesnt make him unkillable it just makes it really REALLY expensive to try to take a village from him.  Its still doable though weve done it several times.Against any good player youll have to time your attacks to land within a couple seconds of eachother if theyre online simply because even free to play players will still have some castle cards laying around most likely.All in all numbers and strategy wins not cards and people who are heavy carders often think themselves immortal and believe they dont need allies so they end up losing.  Id say this game is pay to have an advantage pay more to have a bigger advantage.,Strongholdkingdoms,cf16wlp,0,t5_2tnuj
