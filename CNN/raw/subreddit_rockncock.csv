967341,0,t1_che5jsz,Nope Ive had one for years. SN EDIT ProofI like the JCS stock better due to the adjustable length and the rubber shoulder pad and the folding is handy sometimes too.

A dual pump arm setup solves that simply.  Sheriden style guns also dont do autotrigger well.  Having a big contraption on the side of the gun to get you that feature.  .. can you tell Im a nelson fan?  That said I have a Piranha LB and PGP hanging around.  I love my PGP.  ,rockncock,clw1akq,1,t5_2xrhs

3782665,0,t3_33qm2w,The Azodin Kaos Pump is a great starting place. Not too expensive and a great performer. Beyond that you can look for a cocker pump or the empire snipersame platform just different looks.If youre looking for new cocker pumps I believe paintballagetway.com carries them. My recommendation would be the Kaos Pump though. ,rockncock,cqngak0,2,t5_2xrhs
