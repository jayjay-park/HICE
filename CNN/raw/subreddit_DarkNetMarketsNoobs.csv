BTCs around  and tumbling it can I expect to still have atleast  worth of usable bitcoins?Also Im not worried about my parents but I am worried about LEO I had a mild record as a juvenile and now that Im  and its been cleared Id be very shitty with myself to reinstitute that. Im going to insist my vendor use Mylar packaging but out of curiosity and for whatever its worth do you figure dogs can smell something on blotter say LSD or something of the nMOBE variety without mylar?

2738708,0,t3_2rbecp,The Clearnet is nothing else than the Clear internet that you can see and index like the one you use everyday for facebook etc. And that has nothing to do with Bitcoins directly. The point is that in the clearnet you are exposing what you do with the internet by leaving traces and your activity may be logged by your internet provider NSA etc. In the DarkNet a lot of more anonymity is guaranteed. You can use Bitcoins in both the clear and the dark net...If you rightly buy something in the DarkNet you dont know the Vendor no one can prove that you was the buyer.

I would recommend MBB packaging Tin foil like pouch it is heat seal able and it can be Vac packed.My method.Put on new Latexvinyl gloves.Get Fresh sealy bag.Put contents into sealy with it touching any exterior.Wipe down with disc cleaning fluid or rubbing alcohol.Get a small MBB bag place sealy bag inside Try and make the sealy go in as small as it can ie rolling up or folding..Acquire hair straighteners or iron.Allow the device to get very warmhot.Heat seal the MBB until you can not go any further without touching the sealy bag inside.Cut excess MBB Optional .Rub down the MBB with rubbing alcohol or CD cleaner  I use this method since I cant afford a vacuum packer They can cost up to a grand. If you can get a vaccuum packer then that will work even better. Placing the packet in an envelope Make sure envelope hasnt been contaminated with any substancePrint of a fake invoiceorder note I recommend you create one Place a sticker on the MBB saying for example Mechanical parts will oxidise on opening  Only open when NeededHope this gave you some ideas as to how you can do it ,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,cppzcjt,4,t5_30ajt

Coinbase in particular tracks and cracks down on people getting deposits from and withdrawing to things they dont like.  That said your Ag deposit address is likely unique so you probably wont have a problem but its still only a maybe at best.  You should at the very least use an intermediate wallet between Coinbase and your market and it is recommended to tumble or use more than one intermediary wallet so you at least have some semblence of removing your IRL identity attached to Coinbase with your use of darknet markets.  You should also try to use services like local bitcoins in order to buy some of your coins in cash in person so that your identity isnt ever associated with your coins.,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,cqumk2o,1,t5_30ajt

6366501,0,t1_czd6lll,Good advice although Id say it would be even better to use a Tails Electrum wallet whenever possible and skip the intermediate clearnet wallet if you can avoid it. Just make sure that youre using a different wallet not just a different bitcoin address from the same wallet! on each side of the tumbler   And dont forget to write down your word Electrum  seeds! NOTE HOWEVER that it can be easy to contaminate your clean wallet unless you do this carefully! As I just wrote in another threadgtits important to use a separate Electrum wallet before and after tumbling  not just a separate bitcoin address. This means youll have one word seed thats your backup for your dirty wallet and one additional word seed thats your backup for your clean wallet. DO NOT enable persistence for Electrum. After sending from your dirty wallet to the tumbler youll want to close Electrum then reboot the computer. Then when it boots back up restore your other clean wallet from its word seed and the coin should be there from the tumbler.  gt  gtThe rebooting is important because Electrum will automatically check the default wallets addresses when it starts up  so if you change from the dirty wallet to the clean one in the same session the electrum servers youre connected to will know that those two wallets are controlled by the same person.  ,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,czdaump,3,t5_30ajt

7154324,0,t1_d1rc5ar,Maybe Im too paranoid to ever sell but the way Im seeing it  it only takes one mistake to unravel the whole thing.  In this case tracking. Lets day I get tracking at the post office.  My package breaks open during processing and spills X all over. At that point  postal inspectors can check to see where and when the package originated  and pull surveillance tape. Bam theyve got my face.Our maybe I buy postage online. I use a prepaid card  set up a blank account takes about  minutes maybe more and ship a batch of packages. One gets wet the cardboard breaks  and the contents are in plain view.  A postal inspector checks the tracking  determined what account it came from flags all packages from the same account  and checks for origination where it was picked up. That doesnt get you busted immediately  but it allows them to start narrowing down your location. Am I misunderstanding something here? As a buyer  tracking is great.

There is different opinions about tumblers and when its needed. Search around in here and find your own solution to your personal OPSEC. There is stuff in OPSEC which dosent have a clear answer because of different opinions. MY opinion on a tumbler is as long as you are a buyer who only buys for personal use you can run your coins through a few only use once wallets which are set up through tor. If you are a vendor or big bulk buyer then a tumbler seems more reasonable to be a part of your OPSEC.

Tails does not work on the ARM architecture so far.But hey if you lot find anythign suggesting it works sounds interesting to me as well.,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,d6r5pdc,3,t5_30ajt

Host gt VPN gt Socks gt Socks or however you want to do it since you are on tails all I would do is a VPN and then a Sock but you should be fine if its a small order.Then you would need to get some bitcoins wash them preferrably.  send them through a tumbler make sure to find a reputable one  read the wiki on here  Then load them onto your account on the market and find whatever it is youre looking for.Whenever youre going to by whatever it is make sure to read the reviews. Make sure they have good package security and make sure you are buying from your country and not from outside your country.Hope this helps!,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,d6trx1y,8,t5_30ajt

8767246,0,t3_506lsd,Buy site gt clearnet wallet gt darknet wallet gt tumbler gt marketIf you wanna go two wallets.  You can just go one and  if your clearnet wallet is electrum thats a bit safer because  it is less ID linked than what some people have by the sounds you dont pay for other things with btc regularly so you could get away with one wallet if you wanted but two is better... the more times you transfer the longer thus more difficult the trail back to you buying the bitcoins.  Send via two wallets if you are worried the site might look to where their btc go after you buy them and think thed take action like banning your account if they found out it always went to a tumbler.  I cant advise you on if its likely or not or the repurcussions.  that is your decision.  Two wallets is always better than one  that part is a fact.  You dont want to send coins from the clearnet site to a dnm market directly  so you need an intermediary. which is either your darknet wallet or a tumbler.  Check with the site of course but most markets accept deposits sraight from a tumbling service.  So youre good to go but Id chuck wallet  after wallet one and go straight from the cleaning service tothe DNM.  Once they are cleaned of your interaction with them there is no need to go to another wallet for disguising the trail.  However if you intend to store your cleaned coins so on your next visit you only have to perform one transaction  the process you outlined is best.  Dont store coins on the markets because the site could go downbe hacked.... anything.  You dont controlthe site.  You control your wallet so thats where you store them.  ,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,d71khs7,0,t5_30ajt
8844577,0,t1_d7ajvx2,Ok so Im trying to figure out the best way I could explain this. Of course anything that I do write will have a room for error since we both have different computers. The thumbdrive isnt really the best mode of operations for running tails on mac but you can use it for a persistence volume which is nice. To start burning a verified copy of tails to DVD will help you a bunch. I downloaded the GnuPG imported the tails signature to it and checked that no man in the middle was invovled during the process of the download. I used bittorrent to download tails you can do this too or just use firefox w the verification plugin.After I verified my download of tails inserted an empty DVDr once prompted by OSX select to open in disk utility and then dragndrop the ISO into disk utility. From there I burned my DVD and yay I have a bootable DVD!Next youll want to restart your mac and as soon as you hear the mac start up sound hold the OPTION key. This will take you to a screen to select your startup diskdrive. Select the DVD usually itll take the DVD a few moments to load but not horribly long. and hopefully Tails should boot from the DVD. If it does and tails loads up you ought to be good to use tails. If you want to create a persistent volume youll have to install tails onto your thumbdrive VIA tails OS. Shut down and power on the computer hold option key boot from USB once tails opens go to applications gt tails gt configure persisent volume. Once the volume is created do a hard shut down bc the issue w macs is that w the bootable USB drive tails does not shut down properly and power on again option key select the DVD drive boot tails. Once tails has booted go to applications gt utilities gt disks. Select your thumbdrive select the partition block w the tails OS fat and NOT the tails data click on the  sign thats wedge between the lock and config icon and that ought to delete the OS from your boot drive. This will give you a persistent volume on your bootable tails OS DVD. I hope this helps on some level. this is basically what I did for tails. I hope its not too convuluted and makes some sort of sense. I think the only issues I may see you having would have to do with the WIFI card let me know if thats a thing or if its something you can circumvent by directly connecting to a switchrouter.again hope this helps! If you have anymore questions hopefully I can answer. If I missed something hopefully someone could correct this and tell me im a dummy. anyway good luck!,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,d7azr12,1,t5_30ajt

If you are not very bright and connect your PC to the modem directly by ethernet than you would want to change the MAC address of the network ethernet card.

9021557,0,t3_53r1ey,Just pull the trigger.  Honestly your opsec is tighter than mine and g of anything can be stealthed up pretty easily.  Just dont post about waiting for mailorder drugs on social media and youll be fine P.  My first order from the DNM was by some miracle NOT intercepted and I think itll make you feel better about yours..I placed my first order on a Thursday morning  actually  different orders from separate vendors ranging from overnight to  day delivery.  Now my mailbox is one of those small ones thats about as deep and wide as a standard letter and comes out about  inches so they can stuff a couple letters in there.  The first package to arrive was a priority mail small box and it was just kinda wedged in there.  The next day I went out to find a  x  padded priority envelope folded over and again just shoved right in.  Cool my bud and my edibles are here but I have to wait till Monday for the last one.I go outside Monday morning and my heart sank a little when I saw a little slip in my mailbox instead of another package.  As fate would have it it was a sorry we missed you pickupredelivery slip NOT a love letter.  I jump in my car and scurry up to the local delivery annex.  With my mailbox being so small this is a somewhat regular occurrence even for standard mail so nothing crosses my mind.  I walk in not a care in the world.  Hmm... sure is taking someone a long time to come out and help me.  After about  minutes a nice older postal worker comes out.  I give her the slip and my ID and she goes off to find the package... and then it hit me.The slip.  No one else coming for mail.  Waiting to be helped forever.  Delayed delivery should have been overnight but vendor goofd.  I sit there in raw panic expecting SWAT to bust down every door and window with guns and tasers drawn.  My heart was pounding and I was literally getting sweaty.  I just admitted guilty to having several grams of Schedule II narcotics  hard amphetamines  shipped to my very home.  There was no getting out of it  Every second feels like an hour why is this taking so long?  Just do it already!...then the sweet postal worker comes out with another x padded envelope and hands it to me.  Sorry that took so long someone put it in the wrong bin.  Your driver thought there might be something fragile inside so they didnt want to fold it sorry for hassle.  Anything else I can help you with?With that I say no and wish her a good day.  She does the same.  I walked out of that building looking like I had just seen a ghost I drive home safer than Ive ever driven in my life before finally sitting down in the relative safety of my living room for a good twenty minutes to collect myself.  The next logical step of course was to make good use of all the mail Id gotten over the last few days TLDR Dont panic.  If youre not ordering dealer amounts frequently then you have virtually nothing to worry about as long as the the OPSEC of both you and your vendor are on point.  You really have a better chance of giving yourself heard attack from anxiety than you do of getting a nice knock on the door.  As long as your careful everything will go fine D,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,d7w907e,3,t5_30ajt

9080960,0,t3_54nl4v, It doesnt matter if you send to sigaint.org or the .onion variant. Same thing. You should type your message then include your Public PGP Key at the end and encrypt using the Vendors Public PGP Key. The common protocol is talking to them on the same place you initially talked to them. If you start with sigaint stick with sigaint.  Your first email is asking if they are still doing the deal you want to get. Once you get a response you then ask anything you need to know ie total cost including shipping shipping times do they give tracking and what address do they want the BTC sent to. Then they will respond answering. Then you pay them and send an email saying money was sent. Their response will be a tracking number if they plan on giving tracking number or saying got it expect it around this time.  Then your next response should be Got it thanks.  Also if youre a noob dont do Direct Deals and on markets use escrow and dont finalize early. Dont hit up known vendors about doing DD unless youve heard they do DDs and... Just in general avoid DDs to avoid scams. Check subreddits or forums for the drug you want and see if they have good reviews. And thats about it.,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,d83dtwi,1,t5_30ajt

And itll be he future for all markets eventually I believe as it takes away any exit scam risk of loss.So long as you get one or two transactions out of the way you wont feel so overwhelmed.

9374972,0,t1_d93uf8l,Okay so apparently reddit flagged the link to this website so Ive just copied and pasted the instructionsYes bitcoin ATMs are a great resource for anonymity. Up until recently BTC ATMs are the only way I would purchase bitcoins. Im lucky in that I have a few located around me DC Area gas stations laundry mats even a diner.The only downfall is the exchange rates which Ive found to be around .. Versus Circle where there are not exchange rates except a few cents when transferring to your wallet sometimes.Now using Circle there are numerous steps you have to take before you can use your newly acquired BTCs. But I still find this outweights the high exchanges rates using ATMs or Localbitcoins.Here is a stepbystep guide that will help you accurately tumble your coins. The StepsStep  Create a wallet on the clearnet. We will refer to this as wallet Step  Buy Bitcoins and send the amount you want to mix to wallet .Step  Create a second wallet this time over the Tor network. wallet Step  Send your bitcoins from wallet  directly to wallet .The reason for this is to add plausible dependability between your clearnet wallet and inperson purchases. If you are ever investigated by law enforcement or the company from which you are buying coins this happens with Coinbase.com especially you can reasonably claim that you sent them to someone else who controls wallet  for whatever madeup reason you have in mind as your excuse for your BTC purchase. After that you have no ideadont care what that person did with them nor should anyone expect you to.Step  Create a third wallet also over the Tor network. wallet .Step  Select which mixer you will be using and set up your transaction there using the addresss from wallet . It is best to use multiple addresses and to set random time delays.ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THE CORRECT .ONION LINKS!Scams are rampant everywhere online and the darknet is no different. You can choose your mixers and get the correct URLs from our list of darknet Bitcoin mixers.We recommend Helix by Grams first and then Bitcoin Blender as the two seemingly best in a group of imperfect options. They have both been extremely reliable so far while processing millions of dollars. DO NOT use blockchain.infos shared send or any other coinjoin product as your mixer as those do not completely hide your trail like the others.Helix Grams .onion URL Bitcoin Blender URL NOTE Turn off JavaScript before doing this step if you are using Helix Bitcoin Blender or other mixers that function without it. Click on the S! icon before the address bar in the Tor browser then gtForbid Scripts Globally.Unfortunately Bitmixer still requires users have JavaScript enabled.Save the Letter of Guarantee if you are using Bitmixer. If you are using Helix save the URL it sends you to after you enter your addresss. Make a backup of these or your login details for the other mixers.Step  Send the coins from wallet  over Tor to the address generated for you by the mixer.Step  Assuming these coins are going to be sent to a darknet market if you dont already have your deposit address log in and get it while having JavaScript disabled. Never use any market that requires you to enable JS!Step  You can use Blockchain.infos Tor hidden service to watch for your coins to arrive from the mixer. Once they have restart Tor and then send the coins to your market address or their eventually destination!The reason you should create an extra wallet in between your mixer and market account is in case you ever run in to any type of problem with your account lost password hackedphished lost PGP key etc you can use the fact that you control all of the recent deposit address as proof that you are the rightful owner of this account.You should also create a wallet you control in between any coins you may ever withdrawal from a market and a mixer. This is far more important than the reverse in case the market takes a long time to put your deposit through which happens trust me. Mixers only keep track of the addresses it generates for you for a set amount of time usually between  and  hours. If you initiate a withdrawal from a market directly to a mixers bitcoin address and the market runs into problems and doesnt send your withdrawal for  hours you face a very real risk of the mixer not forwarding your coins. This would not be the mixers fault as they are open about how they work. They purge records every X hours for privacy.TIP You can use Blockchain.infos taint analysis to make sure that no trace remains between wallet  and wallet . Access it like this replacing YOURBITCOINADDRESS in blue with yoursSearch this page for your addresss from wallet . If they arent there youve successfully performed a zerotaint mix of your Bitcoins! If an address from wallet  does show up there is a problem with the mixer you are using you should contact them andor use a different one in the future.The only weakness remaining is the fact that the mixing company has records of your transactions and although they all claim to delete them shortly after the transaction is complete it is possible they could have a trail of where your coins went. You can negate this risk by repeating the process with a second mixing service.I probably made this sound more complicated than it actually is. In total it should only take about  minutes and it is something worth doing if you value your privacy and want to make sure you never lose any coins!As with anything you should do your research before using Bitcoin tumbling services and use the ones with the best reviews and highest levels of trust. The tumblers we list as trusted have been around for some time and have had no verifiable complaints against them. The other services listed are either newer have been hacked or have had numerous complaints against them. We do not link to mixers that are scams or that do not function as advertised.,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,d94cecj,1,t5_30ajt

Its a way to channel all of your internet connections through a server.  Theres some debate whether they help with opsec because on the one hand all traffic has one ip address and could be logged bad. On the other hand its not your ip address and might not be logged good.  Really up to you if you use one or not.  However if your VPN says they log connections or must comply with governments or anything like that then forget it.Anonymous internet  i made this up.  I just mean dont use a school or work network.

9497171,0,t1_d9jmwvq,Circle wallet sounds very secure to you? The guide says if your not tumbling then the bitcoins you received should be from an anonymous source. Technically speaking in that case none of this is necessary. To make it as streamlined as possible just stay on Windows download Tor browser and deposit funds directly from Circle to darknet market and just login through Tor and do your thing. To understand what is necessary you have to understand the purpose of each step and what it adds to your security only you can determine at the end of the day what you find necessary. You do realize the people who have troubles later on are the same exact people who faulted on certain steps and whether through laziness or accidentally omitted steps which led to them landing where LE wants them. By all means go ahead but there is no need to lessen the importance of any of those steps for people to follow in example and land in an undesired situation.

Im upset I chose this guide to follow. Not even mentioning downloading gpgwin. Pretty sad from an otherwise excellent guide.gt gt Also when I say its not a big deal an OPSEC flaw like that is a huge deal its wreckless and makes the DNM riskier than the streets.I absolutely agree. thank you for bringing this guide to my attention I removed it now since it encourages bad opsec practices and there are better guides available.gtThat being said... it was such a small amount that I cannot imagine money being thrown to investigate it.oh boy you would be surprised how bored law enforcement sometimes is and how easily they can get triggered. it just takes a vendor that does not package your order properly to get you a house search. if you have not used tails they will find all the evidence they need to prosecute you for your orders. just hoping that they will not do it because you ordered a small amount is not a good defense tactic.please use tails since that gives law enforcement no info what you did on it and only talk to a lawyer if you ever get in legal trouble.gtstill a one off mistake and it will never happen again.I hope so happy ordering and stay safe.,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,dca6e9z,1,t5_30ajt

10395035,0,t1_dcmaggq,Oh I should say for the record Im more in your same boat. Never actually ordered but spent the past  days or so reading everything I could get my hands on.With tumbling its really just an extra precaution. What it does thats helpful is break the connection. If you purchase the Bitcoin in a way thats tied to you coinbase ATM where cameras are nearby using any identifiable information and then you transfer it to clearnet wallet then darknet wallet then vendorDNM  its possible the police could seize info from the vendormarket and trace it back to you since all of those transactions are recorded on the blockchain and they can subpoena the ATMcoinbaseetc. to provide info leading to your identity.With the tumbler service unless the police manage to seize their equipment as well they wont know who originated the particular transaction because you send BTC to one wallet and they send you BTC from a different wallet. Now it stands to reason that if they went after the tumbling service instead it might actually expose you more depending on how much data they retain after the transaction.Is it necessary? Well if you send it from clearnet to a darknet wallet you should technically have some plausible deniability if you were prosecuted for it. But if they for instance raided a vendor and found your name address and order written down and were able to corroborate that with a money trail starting at you and ending at the vendor I feel like that would be hard to fight in court. But Im certainly no lawyer and not even an experienced DNM user.I think if and when I finally make a purchase Ill be extra careful and do something likePurchasegtclearnet walletgt darknet walletA gttumblegt darknet walletBgtmarketvendorIs that overkill for buying personal amounts? Probably. But its only gonna cost like  more and unless theyre going to take down everyone along that chain itd be pretty hard to put me in jail.But some people say TAILS is overkill and all you need is a clearnet wallet and a darknet wallet.

Since the funds have been broadcast ie he sent them to the market his wallet will reflect that in its balance it might show that it is unconfirmed.The Dream account page is assuming a high or at least standard miners fee. BTC dont just disappear so as long as you just put a low miners fee in they will eventually go through or return to the wallet.No you cannot reverse a transaction from the Wallet end. MAYBE the BTC will return after awhile but maybe not.Weve been seeing posts about dream and slow tx times a lot in the past  hours on this sub but many people also have Dream txs going through so I dont think Dream is to blame.

11560762,0,t1_dg6dkjg,Ive actually thought about the time linkage thing before.  For a personal buyer at least I dont think this is an issue. It would be perfectly reasonable for you to argue that someone else was accessing your Home Network without your knowledge in order to use TOR at those particular times. Everyones Wifi is vulnerable to unauthorized access. By this logic the simple correlation between anonymous TOR acces on your Network nd the purchase of drugs on DNM seems pretty negligible to me. I dont think most courts would convict on that aloneIf you are worried about it thoughm one obvious way to easily circumvent this issue would be to just occasionally log into TOR for  minutes or so every now and then. You dont even have to use it just leave it on for a while and turn it off. Doing that twice for each purchase made is probably enough to destroy any legally pursuable correlation that might be drawn between the times your account made purchases and your ISP logged the use of TOR by somebody. WHo really technically could still be anybody.The Prosector argues that you ISP logged TOR access when these three purchases were made by this particular account. Itd be easy to show other thousands if not millions of ISP logs connected to other people exist showing that exact correlation in addition to to a much larger access logs in which no nefarious correlations can be drawn.Im not saying it could never happen that this might fuck you. But it just seems really unlikely would have to be pretty fucking unlucky or dumb to pull that straaw somehow,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,dg6f0mu,2,t5_30ajt

11697218,0,t1_dglvaak,Once you go to buy theres generally a textbox that says buyers notes or notes for vendor or something along those lines. Paste the encrypted text into that box.Also since many people do this Id like to reinforce that you should never under any circumstances use the markets automatic encryption system with plaintext. Some markets for example AB have a checkbox next to the textbox asking if you want your notes encrypted  do not use that with plaintext as anyone that has access to the market can read it. Always encrypt on your side dont trust a third party. On a similar note dont use iGolder.Sorry my response took so long apparently I dont have enough karma on this account to be able to reply faster,DarkNetMarketsNoobs,dglwcdx,2,t5_30ajt
