5201884,0,t3_3m8stg,Franish is someone who was on GOMI before she started her blog and could be considered a critical commenter.  When she started her own blog the community seemed to give her a pass on things that would not stand if done by other bloggers.  For instance she made money off her links and said so but only hidden on some part of her blog and she also use blind links like writing here link and here link instead of something more transparent like Gap VNeck link and HampM Crew link.People started to point out that Fran should not be given a pass just because she is part of the gomi community and then people turned on her.Just before she flounced there were a ton of comments about playing around with cadavers in med school making jokes or some such thing that showed her as insensitive.

Search function gone supposedly returning soon Site or forum announcement about the upgrade nonexistent New user registration still disabled Lost password reenabledGiven the amount of negative attention a site like GOMI attracts Im dismayed that Partypants is so lax about basic security measures like keeping WordPress up to date.

No its not like GOMI at all. I think thats a good thing. Sure reddit is not for everyone and its only one format. GOMI is another that hasnt gone away for any of us unless youve been banned I guess.

The speed may be too slow for people used to YHL and similar but they both have full time nonblogging jobs. Plus their homes they have two now which is not super relatable but it is what it is are gorgeous. They have some serious DIY chops.And...I like Chris Loves Julia a lot.

6319672,0,t1_cz7rzj7,Suffocated is a good word for it. I had a similar experience to you when I was a SAHM.But I didnt see it coming. At all. I wanted to be a SAHM and I thought Id love it. When I got pregnant I was working but I had a lowpaying job with no room for advancement not a career. I didnt think Id be losing anything by giving up my work and the cost of daycare would have been my entire salary anyway. My husband makes good money. And of course I love my children intensely. It made all the sense in the world for me to stay home with them. Only when I did it did I learn it was a terrible idea.So yeah. To that extent I get TW. I know what it is like to be aimless with regard to career think that SAHM life will be a better choice and find youre terrible at that too. I dont have a religious upbringing or anything else to blame this all on. Some of us...just dont have it together. And you know Im even older than TW and though Im back in the workforce now I still dont fucking know what I want to do for a living really. If I shared my angst about all this with people Id totally sound like a Jenna.So the criticisms of TW that come out as shes bad at career so she should just be a SAHM and not even bother or shes functionally a child because she cant decide what to do with her life... those are the moments I feel like I get TW too.But but but. All of this were talking about? Were doing it completely anonymously. TW is doing it all in public under her real full name. And she spares no detail. While theres a point to which I think its okay and even good to say that you struggle at parenting she goes so far past that point you cant see her with binoculars.,blogsnark,cz7z6oj,16,t5_39xf0

I think the piling on of Rusty Moustache cant recall her exact name both on here and on GOMI and its probably the same people is gross. But GOMI is not the type of place where posters will urge a person with MI to go off their meds  instead theyll urge them to go back to their doctor to get the dose or the meds changed if they are having problems.  I think GOMIers have too much faith in therapy though. Therapy may not help everyone no matter how much they put into it. Not only are there a lot of crappy therapists out there its not that uncommon for bad things to happen to people that they cant control and that leave them scarred for life. ,blogsnark,czvmogh,0,t5_39xf0

How many times has someone on the news said that person looks guilty?  Or that isnt how someone would act if they were truly sorry?  Etc. Etc.

Im saying that its not realistic to say she can easily find a high paying job. And her sex has nothing to do with it. Thousands of people with advanced degrees are struggling now and shes going to have the same difficulties as them.

It took a long time to even get my foot in the door and later find something lucrative enough to feel comfortable financially. Im sure its even shittier today to get your foot in the door. Natalie may have better chances if she looked in less competitive areas after hypothetically graduating but even then its likely that it will take a long time to land something high paying. Lets be real Natalie wouldnt go to school to be a petroleum engineer or whatever is making bank these days.

At first I was surprised that the other moms were not hovering over their babies  in the NICU then I realized I was only there  because of uncertainty of what was happening. They knew what was happening and they knew it was ok to not be there. A lot of them were working saving their maternity leave for when baby came home etc. You can honestly only spend so much time in the NICU as it really wears you down and is incredibly hard. The nurses are always encouraging you to go home or go do something for yourself etc. ,blogsnark,d5p6ago,19,t5_39xf0

8657392,0,t3_4yedk8,Ill miss the memos though they havent been that frequent since things began to get hot. It was kind of weird to read leaked memos that Nick knew would be leaked and which were written both to address his staff as well as the rest of the world.Ill miss that six months from now they would have inevitably and inexplicably rehired Natasha VargasCooper undoubtedly the worst journalist gainfully employed in this decade. Ill miss what Gawker was in the very beginning. Sites like RBD and by extension GOMI were born essentially from the commenting community of Old Gawker. While Old Gawker would have changed anyway and possibly even been shuttered by now I dont understand why Denton felt the need to go tabloid with the brand. It seems like all great things are first discovered by a small and passionate and smart community which they had. Old Gawker had influencers before anyone said things like influencers. It was a substantial community of people who all got the joke. There is nothing like it in media today and thats a shame.Instead there was this rush for the mass audience the refusal to carve out wider roles for talented staff which meant Gawker bled and still bleeds talent the moment they distinguish themselves and pioneering the current media landscape with a bunch of sites that are all basically the same and publish largely the same stories with maybe  difference from one to another. I remember the moment I knew it was different. No not when Natasha VargasCooper snickered while exposing the use of feminine products by a powerful woman though thats up there. It was an article about a musician who only had one hand doing some kind of charity stunt and people actively mocking the guy and making puns over a man with only one hand. It was made worse that they werent funny  they were like frat jokes. That was the only time I ever flounced from a site.Anyway by two years ago I didnt just not read Nicks Clickbait Emporium but actively avoided ever winding up on their servers for any reason. It wasnt hard because anything they wrote about someone else invariably wrote a better article about it. Sometimes they were even exGawker too.,blogsnark,d6nsf7t,7,t5_39xf0

Something about how your body handles the alcohol.  Like I said I have no idea if there is any truth behind it.

I think its rude and weird and kind of creepy. Im not a maam. Im me my name. Use it or just stop after yes no or thank you. The men who call me maam are doing because they resent my authority or at least that is how it sounds. Once a woman called me maam and it was super weird and awkward.

9645214,0,t1_da1t8y6,Agreed. I think what we are seeing is the late stage of capitalism and its very protracted and torturous collapse.  As we move towards greater automation modernization and globalization the job market will only decrease and our current system will increasingly be unable to be self sustaining or to meet the basic needs of the people. We are told that the onus falls on the individual for failing working hard enough to earn success but the failure is in the system not the individual. There is not a broad enough social safety net and there is no movement towards protecting and increasing workers rights. The word union has become synonymous with being an unpatriotic traitor.  Any attempts to unionize are immediately squashed by corporations and the government turns a blind eye towards supporting any labor or union movement.  Anyone who demands greater rights equal pay and greater benefits is labeled as lazy and wanting something for nothing. Any progress or progressive measures will not come from the government and the private sector doesnt have any financial interest in funding social programs. The revolution will not be televised because the media is owned by the elite ruling class. We dont need Trump in office to know that shit is fucked up. Even if Hillary had been elected there would still be a chance for people to press for change. At least she had experience and knows a thing or two about diplomacy. I suspect that should his tariff plan be placed into action that the cost of food and manufactured good will skyrocket. It will do nothing to bring jobs to America because as you pointed out. We do not have those capabilities. He used empty promises to play the fragile ego of white men who dont understand where all their privilege has gone and he won because all that they have been taught is that they should be the winners.  Not the losers. Not seeing that they are losers because we all losers. The working class is here to be exploited only. Under the current system there isnt a snow balls chance in hell of bringing back the American Dream because it wasnt really there to begin with. ,blogsnark,da1z03q,7,t5_39xf0

The kids dont need to be calling her new husband Daddy ugh and hiding their grief. The blog posts by the new husband are at best unbelievably tone deaf. And the extended family is now supporting the kids through two major life transitions happening simultaneously. The marriage is a comfort to FF but painful to everyone else and neither she nor her new white bearded lord of the manor show any sensitivity to that. Its just a mess and so sad to watch. And WTF with his story about living with a family whose husbandfather died from cancer?

Both her son and daughter are always dirty like really actually dirty and everything with her yearold daughter is about being goals like giving the poor kid pigtails when her hair is barely long enough shoving her into a bikini so they can be matching etc. Her son has a speech delay which she publicly addressed on the blog but since then they have been traveling all over the world and moved to Hawaii so its speculated that he isnt receiving speech therapy.When they moved to Hawaii they didnt do any research about bringing their dog and so he got left somewhere apparently with a family with lots of land? until they can ship him to Hawaii put him in quarantine and get the right vaccines. I dont get the point of having a pet who the kids constantly pull on and climb on if you dont actually spend time with him.She and her husband started a line of hair extensions but they dont respond to customer emails or questions on social media and for the first several months of the company existing did not use any women of color as models. Now they added one black girl but only after they got called out on it.I only started reading the thread because she seemed pretty innocuous and I was curious if something big had happened to make her thread blossom into  page at the time like Neelys lawsuit but its mostly just petty gossip and bitching about how she photoshops herself to look slimmer there is no evidence she has done that in recent years but doesnt photoshop out her nipples because nipples are apparently so shameful. For the most part I think shes fine and shes actually friends with a friend of mine but the shilling of her kids for click the thing with the dog and the poor Shaunalevel customer service for her new business are what make me keep coming back for more.Im sure theres more that she does but I cant think of it off the top of my head.,blogsnark,dc7lxb7,7,t5_39xf0

10390817,0,t3_5opz49,TLDR my marriage is garbage. Im trying to figure out how to leave. Im not going to give a bunch of back story because it would be the size of a book but I just need to share this on my throwaway. Ive been in a shitty marriage for a while and I havent left for many different reasons one being that I make stupid decisions based on the belief that people can change. Part of the shit has been abuse in every form with physical abuse stopping  years ago. And with an abusive marriage any type of functional communication is impossible. Ive left twice. The first time I left and returned was very early on when I thought that changing was desirable for my spouse. The second I went back to marriage because we were making an overseas move and I had zero resources. Ive kept in my mind a resolve to finally leave and divorce in a few years when Ive graduated college and have a job to provide for my children. Because I have literally nothing. No family for support no friends in this state or near here no job history no car no degree no money. And since moving things have been a better level of shitty. I would have said a week ago that the marriage shifted from abusive to very dead. He has changed a bit in that the anger episodes dont come up unless we talk about something. So we simply never talk about anything but the kids.Within the past two weeks he threw something at me that hit and bruised me hand. Then wrote a list of the reasons why our youngest couldnt be his child because he is convinced I had affair. Ive heard this cheating line dozens of times but this particular delusion wont go away. And last night he left for a few hours then came back home to shower which was weird because he showered in the morning. I thought he went to the gym to workout because he made a protein shake. Then I saw his phone get a text saying I didnt hear back from you I will be at Such Hotel in Such City tonight. I checked our cars GPS log and there is a previous address plugged in for Such City. In the past he had looked at ads for escorts has emailed and I have no idea if he ever carried through. Now you have read all this and think God woman you have been an idiot! And I agree. My reasons for staying are varied and when you are in an abusive relationship it takes a long time to see what is up and downnight and day. I cant confront him due to his past history of anger and abuse. We cant talk about it and we cant even work out a plan for a civil divorce  he doesnt have the maturity or reason. My whine is this I need to divorce him but I still have nothing. My forming plan involves leaving then living off of grants scholarships and loans until I graduate. Im just scared and I dont think I can financially make it starting at zero with  kids. If you made it through thanks for reading. ,blogsnark,dclv4ys,9,t5_39xf0

So arent men responsible for that choice? Men have the right to decide well I am not comfortable with a woman possibly aborting my baby so I will not have sex. Instead of demanding that a man gets to decide what happens after a woman gets pregnant why not make him responsible for choosing to have sex. Even if its unfair and unbalanced men still have the choice. They can make a variety of choices. They can choose to have uncomfortable conversations with women prior to sex to see if they are on the same page and only have sex with women who have the same beliefs. Or they can make birth control decisions for themselves. Or they can not have sex. I am way over hearing about the poor men who dont get to make the choice in what happens to the baby when they did in fact make a choice by having sex no? You have sex knowing full well you wont have an options if it ends in pregnancy. ,blogsnark,dctxian,8,t5_39xf0

11064748,0,t1_delj5m7,I think Im in this camp too. When she was bragging about being able to ride her bike to coffee shops and yoga studios last month that sounded authentic and something shed genuinely be interested in. The other thing that stuck out to me is that when she was explaining why she added so many bedrooms to the cubicle farm she mentioned something about always having live in help in the future. Speculation alert I think she somehow convinced TH that she would get a full time job when she had live in childcare. TH imported Nanny Aunt to either enable this to happen or call her bluff whichever perspective you prefer  Jenna obviously has no intention of working full time but probably thought shed be able to extend Nanny Aunts visa no problem and just keep stringing it out until TH gave up. Something happened with USCIS that annoyed her though and I would imagine it was finally dealing with someone who actually told her NO for once in her life and didnt endlessly enable her. Now Nanny Aunt has to leave and with no real job or salary on the horizon TH is not willing to shell out more money for live in childcare. So she has to move if she wants free full time childcare.What baffles me about this choice though is the kids ages. It would make more sense to me if she had a baby and a toddler. T is in school full time. T is  and presumably starting prek in the fall so shell also be in public school for most of the day. SAHMs of school aged children have a pretty cush life. Jenna would have lots of free time to do whatever it is that she does during school hours. Maybe TH did finally put his foot down about extra childcare. She really cant handle spending a few hours with her children after school and before he comes home from work in order to continue living in an area she was professing to love as a recently as a few weeks ago?And this is not taking into consideration the fact that theyre risking a lot of money on this move if they cant sell the house for a price that recoups the cost of the renovation. From how shes described him it surprises me that hed be willing to do that I mean have you seen the backyard?
