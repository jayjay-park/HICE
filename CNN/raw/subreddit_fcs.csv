6322249,0,t1_cz83pho,Youre not wrong.....but there is something to losing your starting QB. NDSU was obviously able to adjust and did just fine with Stick. Ohio State had some ridiculous depth at QB last year. However if a team relies on roughly at  passrun offensive attack and there is a significant dropoff from QB to QB then defenses will really be able to key into whatever strengths you have left.Now losing a starting lineman RB safety etc...good playoff teams should have the depth at those positions to still play however they like. In that case you are  correct. The QB position really is special though. Florida had a rough time with that this year. First year HC looked great for the first half of the season....then they lost their starting QB and couldnt score points to save their life.edited grammar ,fcs,cz89qr9,2,t5_2sy54
