7952,0,t3_1sjzd8,Its a great platform to start learning to do your own repairs and upgrades.  Really good alder body and comfortable neck but not too precious to modify.  Dont spend more than another guitar upgrading it though. Its nice to have a banger guitar around the house to let your friends play or to take somewhere while you leave your best guitars safe at home. Its also good for people first learning to play. No distractions with too many pickups and tremolo. ,telecaster,cefcb47,1,t5_2rl37

959246,0,t3_252uie,I went to my local shop and tested one out. Dont care for the humbucker. I would like to take one home and really see what tones i could squeez out. What i would like is a solid mahogany body with lindy  ps and a  in warwick baritone neck.  Add a g or b  bender. Bigsby. If i had  id totally go for that. I ,telecaster,chdbptn,1,t5_2rl37

4013404,0,t3_36gdyw,Most solid body Teles thru an American sounding amp like a Fender will get that sound. A solid body Tele with the vintage ash tray brass saddle bridge and a bright Fender amp should do the trick. Dont forget to use the bridge pickup. Someone else can probably give better advice but thats just my  cents. ,telecaster,crdrc32,4,t5_2rl37

5847932,0,t3_3vby31,Shop around and you should be able to find a used standard for around your price range. Play before you pay. They are all different. Go to your guitar store and play everything you can get hands on. Learn the differences first hand. What works for someone else might not be for you. For the love of God dont buy online. Good luck and dont forget to post a NGD pic!,telecaster,cxm6xgf,1,t5_2rl37

6565010,0,t3_45ghot,I put a Lil ST and a prail in one of my teles and have to agree with uarakele . The prail is awesome split series parallel  but the split lil   not so much i like it in humbucker mode just fine but single coil mode is pretty much just a volume drop. Next time i have it apart Ill probably rewire it for series parallel instead.,telecaster,czydkfe,2,t5_2rl37

9786689,0,t1_daflioy,Id go ahead and gut all the electronics. Replacing the cheap pots switches and wires is a pretty standard upgrade for the MIM guitars. You will definitely notice improved tone and better response from your volume and tone knobs. Plus its easy and relatively cheap.,telecaster,dajf7ws,1,t5_2rl37
