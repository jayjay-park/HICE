6756776,0,t1_d0i5h15,Its not on the play store sorry. Youll have to open this website  on your phone then press the center image to download the towelroot apk. Once it download install the apk and open the towelroot app. Press the make it ran button and you should have root. To check download and run the app Root Checker which should tell you whether youre rooted or not. If it says that youre not rooted then towelroot wont work on your firmware version. I find towelroot to be a very easy and fairly foolproof method for rooting but the only problem is that its exploit has been patched in newer versions of android. If root checker says youre not rooted there are other ways to root but I personally think that they are harder for normal people to use.Now that youve run towelroot if everything went right you have what is known as a temporary root meaning that when you reboot the root will be gone. To make that root permanent you will need to install a root manager. I use SuperSU Once you install it open it and let it install its binaries.,rooting,d0i7h0i,1,t5_2xxuf
