1623886,0,t3_2cw1t1,Favorite FREE mod Convertible Top speed sensor bypass URL  Lets you put the top up or down while rolling by cutting the sensor wire to the convertible top control. After that all it takes is one click up on the handbrake to allow you to operate the top. This is great for when youre stuck in traffic and decide you want to put the top up or down while rolling slowly. I wouldnt recommend trying to put the top up or down at speed.

2989660,0,t3_2ua2p6,One thing Ive noticed is that any S in my area with any accident history is a salvage title. I dont know if the body parts are just very expensive but it seems like even small amounts of damage can total one of these. That being said a salvage title wouldnt phase me as long as the current owner has some history on the repairs done. Many reputable body shops will even guarantee their paint work so if anything goes wrong with the paint in that area they will repair it for you. The main thing you want to check is the frame. If there is any frame damage walk away. Not worth the headache of not being able to get a good alignment and the structural integrity could be compromised. Your safety is not something I would risk to get a cheaper deal. ,S2000,co7vj8i,1,t5_2sb7t

An equivalence would be driving a drag car on the street without a drivers license or any driving experience.Whenever you are transmitting with that Baofeng on FRS you are putting out  times the power allowed FRS only allows . watts and you are using KHz of deviation instead of the legal KHz. It also uses khz bandwidth instead of .khz in FRS So you are making the adjacent  channels totally useless to other FRS users whenever you transmit. You also cannot use a removable antenna on FRS frequencies. If you had good line of sight like a mountain top and good atmospheric conditions you could make FRS impossible to use for anyone within  miles or so on all  channels.  ,S2000,cvdvr8v,1,t5_2sb7t

11425176,0,t3_6314i4,Same sort of as ustahlgrau  I just use bluetooth earbuds for music podcasts when I need to spend time on the freeway or something. If Im out in the backroads Im normally just enjoying the car. I bothered to get the radio code found and get it working but havent bothered to replace the stockrotted speakers theres just no need.This is probably the best use of the space Ive seen. Can you close the door still to stealth these up when you park?,S2000,dfr164u,2,t5_2sb7t
11443010,0,t1_dfszie3,Id say more of a th vs th difference. The primary motivation for me to get the as was because my summer tires are not rated to work below  degrees Celsius. There is not much difference between the as and the pss tbh the as is fine for regularspirited driving. The only times Ive really used the pss is for autocross.You gotta understand that the ass are probably the most performance oriented all seasons you can buy,S2000,dft1zbm,1,t5_2sb7t

11473115,0,t1_dfq7t93,Hey guys the tough thing about doing this was that in an ideal world both cars would have to be on the same dyno one after the other. I had to use graphs which I felt best represented each car so it might not be that accurate but I made this for myself to better understand the engine characteristics of each. ,S2000,dfwh0ud,1,t5_2sb7t
11542142,0,t3_64q8mx,Ive had two Ss so far. For reference I drive the piss out of them and I dont mean just ripping through gears in a straight line. My first one was out every weekend on backroads getting romped through huge compressions jumps just driving it damn near flat pretty much always. Ive never had any issue with either car and both were over k. Routine oil changes changed the timing tensioner on my first one and replacing consumables.I just dont think this car can be beat in terms of how hard you can drive it without having any issues.

11662523,0,t1_dghpri3,The thing about having a hardtop for me is the duality. I recently purchased a double sided carbon fiber Mugen hardtop for my . Ive always wanted one. Driving the car with a hardtop is a different experience. Especially if you have supporting mods. Nonetheless I absolutely love cruising with the top down as well. For people who want both either buy OEM or get an aftermarket HT with OEM latches. This makes the task of removing your hardtop for those days really easy.  There are a number of pluses to having the option of a hardtop on an s.  I wouldnt make it a permanent hardtopcoupe though.,S2000,dghyn07,2,t5_2sb7t
