5342446,0,t3_3nje3s,The Blacula movies are awesome because even though theyre cheesy and funny William Marshall actually gives a very nuanced dignified performance that actually really makes you respect and feel for his character.  This scene in particular is a great example of how his talent raises this movie up. A vampire being faced down by zany s pimps who are going to beat his black ass for some bread is about as absurd of a setup as it comes but the sheer earnestness of his response not only lets you know that Blacula okay his real name is Mamuwalde but Blaculas more fun to say is in many ways noble figure but also actually sort of makes you start to take the scene seriously.,exploitation,cvuk1gv,2,t5_2sf0q
