37002,0,t3_1uihci,Hey  Im a big fan of yours on rketo. Can you link me post example?Edit never mind found that post. Question is there a reason why you want to change the width of the images? It looks like your theme is scaling them based on the parent container for the responsive layout. It doesnt seem to make a difference. You can always do a find and replace in the database that would be the fastest way.,Wordpress,cein751,1,t5_2qhjq
46366,0,t1_cejpew6,Well actually I first learned about the Genesis framework when I went to WordCamp London a couple of months ago.  A developer was raving about it and how they designed all their client sites around it.  It didnt really twig at the time but when I had a realization of my slow site speed it came back to the forefront of my mind.I then read up on it and read some reviews about it all.  It seemed to click and I did some speed tests on the demos and the number of requests to the server was extremely low.  Plus I loved the simplicity of the themes.,Wordpress,cejpjtz,1,t5_2qhjq

69532,0,t3_1uvw4u,The issue is two fold .  As others have mentioned you cant use wpredirect in javascript as it is a php function..  The window.location  starthere isnt working either because you arent listening for an event.  Javascript needs to know when to redirect.  You can use addEventListener if you dont want to use jQuery or a variety of events  to trigger a function if you do.  Read the documentation at either of those links to see how to trigger the event.  You can do it when the checkbox is clicked the form is submitted page loads etc.  Right now your code is saying If its checked redirect but on page load its never going to be prechecked most likely.  What you need to say is When someone insert your event of choice here check to see if this is checked and if it is redirect them.Also for questions like this dont forget StackOverflow as a great resource when troubleshooting your programming issues.Good luck.Edit added a bit more to .,Wordpress,cemcfsy,1,t5_2qhjq

Wordpress wouldnt automatically include them.. Even if the header.html and header.html files were included the links to the resources images styles would not function.For you this means that youll have to. Make a backup of the entire folder containing the Wordpress installation using your FTP client. Always do this at the beginning of a project!. Duplicate the thesis theme folder on the server. If you break the theme later you can go back quickly by renaming the original and backup folders.. Find out which theme files you need to tweak. You will probably have to make changes to both the header.php and header.php files.

In the example the end user can extend the functionality of the loop that I use in the main plugin by making a direct copy of the plugin file and editing it to their liking while maintaining plugin core files through updates since the file itself would sit outside of the plugin folder.,Wordpress,cgjo8gf,2,t5_2qhjq

1945777,0,t3_2gyc4l,The simplest method is to just add a text link or image link to the pdf file when clicked the browsers will handle it the way the users preference is set open it in adobe reader download it open it with the browser etc.Theres nothing wrong with letting people do what they want.  Just like you have it.Also its very bad form to place a pdf on a web page.  PDFs are fixed size and further that size is in inches.  This is the opposite in every way of how computers cell phones tablets etc display content.  So if you are trying to gain employment that has anything to do with the internet or computers you may want to consider alternate methods other than a pdf.  Since every pdf was created from an existing document often you can just copy the text from the original document.  WP even has a special feature in the editor that allows you to copy the text right from MS Word.On the other hand HR people and execs are sometimes completely clueless about computers and thus think things are supposed to be in pdf form and since these same people often have a control disorder they demand that resumes be submitted as pdfs.THE BEST SOLUTIONPresent the resume in HTML from within the WP editor.  Also attach and add a link to a pdf file of the same resume for the control freaks.Youll get bonus points from experienced professionals that have to deal with the control freaks in HR.The only usefulness in a pdf is the ability to lock the document so it cant be edited.  You already gain that ability by presenting it as text on a web page.,Wordpress,ckno24p,1,t5_2qhjq

2453347,0,t1_cmewrk1,No problem at all! Ill try to explain the second method a little clearer.For the sake of the explanation lets assume your main domain where you showcase work is chadshobbies.com and the domain where you sell stuff is chadhobbiessold.com. The second method would remove store.chadshobbies.com all together.chadshobbies.com would be set up to go to your regular site.In your wordpress installation which is now not a network install but a normal installation you would create a page called shop that would display the things you are selling andor links to other shoplike sections.that pages url would be chadshobbies.comshopNow you would edit the DNS settings for chadshobbiessold.com and set up a redirect to chadshobbies.comshopthe domain isnt really set up for your server at this point its simply redirecting users to your shop page at chadshobbies.com. If you set it up with masking the url would always look like chadshobbiessold.com it wouldnt generate any unique URLs. If you set it up without masking the first time a user clicks on a product the URL would change back to chadshobbies.comproductnameSo you can see the advantages and disadvantages of using this method. Its simple.. and if you just want to be able to hand out a cool URL to people that gets them to the shop section on your site  this works. the caveat is they cant really link directly to products if you use domain masking and if they share product links they wont be under the chadshobbiessold.com url.Im really bad at explaining shit Im sorry. But TLDR I think the multisite set up is best for you p ,Wordpress,cmexqen,2,t5_2qhjq

The answer may be no which would be greatYou know business decisions. Then if you have to fix the site try to do a selfassessment. Its hard as a nontech to figure out how much fixing it will cost.

3031243,0,t1_cobpp6a,Ill add in more detail to this section to cover this BUT I do disagree that Wordfence caching or failban do nothing.My reasoning is that for a DDOS attack against your site to be worthwhile for the attacker the benefits they gain have to outweigh the costs of running the DDOS.The costs of running the DDOS are really opportunity costs  what I mean by that is that they could be earning money using their botnet and their time for something else.So  if you can increase the cost of the DDOS then you reduce the chances of it happening being effective or lasting a long time if it does happen.Ill also add the vast majority of wordpress sites are not at risk of DDOS since theres little money or reputation to be gained by successfully bringing down a blog which gets less than  users per month.To increase the cost of the DDOS you need to be able to survive traffic spikes for any traffic that makes it past Cloudflare. That includes having pages which are served up immediately WITHOUT touching wordpress  e.g. directly from Varnish or NginxAPCMemcached etc.Anyway  you are right  if someone decides to rent out  bots to attack your site for half an hour if you dont have scaled out architecture then really its your upstream network protection thats going to help.Theres an interesting article here from Cloudflare about a recent Gbps attack a customer of theirs received  they claim their customer never even saw ANY of that traffic since they blocked it all. This looks like one of the easier to detect bot attacks however  its using something called DNS reflection. My understanding of this is that many name servers around the world have a security hole allowing any computer to request DNS records using the UDP protocol which allows them to easily fake their IP address.The attacker then sends DNSSEC request because DNSSEC records return large amounts of data but they change the IP address to that of their target. This means these badly configured DNS servers send all that traffic to the target flooding their bandwidth.Cloudflare protected against this entirely.Other types of botnet DDOS attacks are pricey  so make it even more expensive for them to attack you by having a site that scales well you can easily support  page requests per minute on a small VPS and have a good CDN like Cloudflare to protect you upstream as well as reduce bandwidth consumption by serving up static files.,Wordpress,coc6pq5,1,t5_2qhjq

3103540,0,t1_cojoen4,First of all if you want documentation WordPress codex is a good place to start.. Im not sure what your goal is. If its just putting up a quick website then skip this step and step . On the other hand if you want to learn web development it really helps to have a basic understanding of how the web works. For example whats a server whats a browser how is information exchanged between them awareness of markup server and client side languages rudimentary knowledge of databases. If you have never been exposed to this its good to start small with simple htmlcss pages and playing around with Apache or Nginx on your own computer. You will run into roadblocks and you will have to read technical documentation.. Youll need hosting. There are plenty of budget ones around BlueHost JustHost GoDaddy Hostgater etc. Most of them are cheap for a reason your bandwidth storage and access to the server OS will be limited. That said its perfectly fine to use them if your new to web development. This will probably cost you anywhere from  to  per month.. Youll need to register a domain name. Most of the time your hosting provider will have an option to buy a domain name. The price will depend on TLD .org costs more than .com. Usually registration is around  but youll have to pay about  a year to renew.. Most of the time budget hosts have a one click install for WordPress just look through your control panel. If you want to do it manually youll have to follow these directions The exact steps will vary from hosting provider to hosting provider.. Move on from cheap shared hosting as soon as you have the skills to do so. Look into VPS hosting providers like DigitalOcean or Linode and Hover for domain name registration. Linux command line proficiency is often a requirement to take advantage of the more advanced stuff like VPS. So is proficiency in serverside languages php in case of WordPress.EDIT Just looked around DigitalOcean they have one click installs of WordPress too their control panel is way more user friendly than anything else Ive seen. They are more expensive than most budget hosts though.,Wordpress,cojoinu,2,t5_2qhjq

3506857,0,t1_cprz5yd,Thanks a lot!Im absolutely serious about it however the caveat is that the website I want to build has to be up and running fast and the product that I already sell and want to sell via the website will probably be available for only a couple more months. So this means I wont have the time available to learn as thoroughly for this project which is in addition to my full time job by the way. Eventually Id love to do that as it will help me with other opportunities Im sure. I dont even seem to know the basic components of a website much less of an online store so having specific pointers like the videos you linked helps me a lot! I wonder now though time being of the essence and it not being a long sold product whether I should opt for getting something set up on Squarespace or Shopify or other similar sites as opposed to build one via Wordpress myself. My only concern in building it myself is compromising the quality most importantly the functionality of the website for the cost of monthly fees on Squarespace etc. Though I am not sure that the Squarespace situation would be as simple as me ordering it.

This will give you practice of setting up a site.Many themes will come with an option to add custom CSS and you can tweak the design this way.Install some plugins and learn how to use some of the popular plugins like Contact Form  SEO Yoast Advanced Custom Fields WooCommerce etc.Once you are comfortable you can make a business out of setting up premium themes for clients and using the built in options and customization features to create a site for theme without ever having to dive into PHP.If a client requires some functionality or customization you cant handle you can always outsource it.,Wordpress,cpsvt35,2,t5_2qhjq

Most of the themes on WordPress.org will have support for most jetpack modules especially if they were released in the past year or so. Im gonna paste some links to themes that may work out well for you. In no particular order...     About Jetpack you can read more about that particular module at this link  There is a link at the bottom of that article to a list of themes developed by automattic creators of JetPack and lots of WP contributions that should all work with the infinite scroll youre looking for. If you need more customization besides what the theme offers I would suggest looking for a plugin or creating a child theme. My advice try to do as much as you possibly can without being hacky using just a theme Jetpack and WordPress core.

3941549,0,t1_cr5emql,EllisLabs plays it very close to the vest when it comes to security. They dont release information on security vulnerabilities discovered in their platform publicly whereas the WordPress community is very open about publishing security information and patches so it is impossible to compare apples to apples here. On both platforms most of the security issues come from third party plugins and not from core.EllisLabs suffered a hack on their servers on March   and waited until May   over a month later  to send an email to their users recommending that they change their passwords. EllisLabs method of security is security by obscurity preferring opacity to transparency. That does not equal a more secure platform.For me one of the most important factors separating WordPress from ExpressionEngine in terms of security is the fact that you can update WordPress core and plugins with one click and the upgrades are unlikely to break anything. With ExpressionEngine updates have to be sourced downloaded installed and checked manually and risk of breakage is very high. I would be surprised if OPs devs did a particularly good job of keeping EE and all plugins up to date due to the time effort hassle and risk of breakage involved.,Wordpress,cr5kjfz,1,t5_2qhjq

Paradoxically once it went to an annual subscription the updates slowed down.  Havent heard much from the developer lately.  The traffic on the forums dropped off a fair amount also.  Over the past few years the number of builder plugins and themes has mushroomed so it is not as unique as before  people have more options.If the developer would start pumping updates and new features I imagine the forums would pick up.

Once youve done that youll need to code a custom widget with some script that can use jQuery to ...Nah just kidding. I dont know the theme but if you cant change it using the admin control panel open the web page in Firefox rightclick on the title and inspect element. Use the CSS rules display to find the line in the theme CSS where the font is set and then use Appearance gt Editor to edit the style sheet to change the font. The only thing about editing the theme style file directly is if you ever upgrade the theme youll have to change the font again. Its actually pretty easy to create a child theme that just has this one CSS change in it and that will solve the upgrade problem. ,Wordpress,curjhdw,1,t5_2qhjq

5275525,0,t3_3n8iva,    function registermymenu          registernavmenuheadermenu Header Menu           addaction init registermymenu In the code above you created a function called registermymenu but you are referencing a function named registermymenu in the addaction. Thats not the source of the problem but something to be aware of in the future.You should be using the aftersetuptheme hook instead of init. You dont need to call addthemesupport menus  as the registration function will do this for you.You dont need to use both functions either. registernavmenu will register one menu. registernavmenus will take an array and allow you to register multiple menus in a single call.For best practices you should preface your functions with the theme name. The aftersetuptheme hook is useful for adding theme support for some other items so I like to create a generic function for that hook and place my calls for menus image sizes etc. in there.So try this    themenamesetup         registernavmenu headermenu  Header Menu           addaction aftersetuptheme themenamesetup      ,Wordpress,cvm0b2w,1,t5_2qhjq

Most of the premium themes put a loaded slider in the front page of their demo to woo the user as well.these sliders are not only rather jquery heavy they also contain big images. there are even themes which imitate designs like medium com that huge text over huge background image scrolling one pages.all of them are slow in loading. and if you rip the slider huge images etc not much is left behind.but worst part is that a lot of the premium themes use frameworks. so you may end up uploading  mb of theme files. not all mb gets used of course but theme has a huge framework behind it and to render the site first wordpress works then theme framework works then theme is rendered. generally its a good idea to stay away from anything that has framework in its description no matter how hardly they advertise it.,Wordpress,cx7o8dh,4,t5_2qhjq

7372533,0,t3_4g9syu,Let me break down my experience just a smidge If you understand the actual logic behind the code then it wont matter whether its PHP JavaScript Go Python C Ruby or whatever else the kids might be using these days. Picking up another languageplatform to fulfill a clientcompany wantneed will be trivial in the grand scheme of things if you actually understand programming.WordPress is fantastic and Ive used it greatly and potentially horribly... not gonna lie during the course of my career. Its really awesome for building websites but its really just a bunch of PHP code. Admittedly it has some quirks here and there but thats kind of the modus operandi for PHP. Bottom line is that if you know PHP well enough youll have no problem jumping into WordPress head first and functionally making do whatever the hell you want it to.The same can be said of JavaScript platforms like React. If you know JavaScript well enough then React Angular Node Symfony etc etc etc will all make a lot of sense and you can make them do pretty much whatever you want.So what do JavaScript and PHP both have in common? A hell of a lot to be perfectly honest about it. No theyre not used for the same things or at least they shouldnt be most not all of the time but theyre both fundamentally using the same general sorts of logic and data types. Theyre both programming. A proper understanding of programming will give you a leg up no matter how you choose to pursue it because youll be able to understand the full application stack a hell of a lot better.WordPress exclusive I became a much better back end dev because I learned a thing or two about how programming on the front end works. I was also able to jump in as a front end dev in a few situations because I knew how both sides worked. The common denominator there is just programming.My advice Learn to be a hell of a programmer. Language and platform are of minimal concern to someone who is a hell of a programmer.,Wordpress,d2g7fj1,2,t5_2qhjq

Where to change these two things you ask? Well that depends on what WordPress theme you have installed in some cases going to the general settings page will lead you to some form fields where you can change that information but in some premium? themes you have to find a custom settings page that they offer to make these modifications. No one can give you an exact answer to your question because it all depends on how the original author of that theme wrote its code.EDIT According to the metadata of the styles.css file used by the theme you have installed the author is Boxy Studio so why not ask them directory?

9118075,0,t3_555csn,Everyone is just telling you you are wasting your time.  But I understand that the needs of your client outweigh the waste of time factor here and if he wants to use THIS widget you should deliver just that.  So here is what you do.Basically just start with a barebones wordpress theme and a fresh installif you need help preparing this just pm me.  By barebones wordpress theme I mean literally a folder with just the required files to allow it to install onto wordpress.  Dont download underscores or some other starter theme used for theme development.  You want just the absolute basic files in there.  The index.php file is what will be loaded by default you can put whatever the heck you want to put there to do your own site.  If you need additional pages simply create templates in the template directory its simple.When you want to put that widget in you need to register an area for it.  In that template file or in the index.php you will include a line of code like this    lt?php dynamicsidebarmysidebar?gtand then in the barebones theme function.php file you should include this to register it    registersidebararray        name gt Displayed Name of Widget Area        id gt mysidebar        description gt Widget area description        beforewidget gt ltdivgt        afterwidget gt ltdivgt    the before and after just indicates I want to wrap that in a div but you might not want to do that.Now you can login to yoursite.comwpadmin and drag the widget into this Displayed Name of Widget Area area and it will show up on your index.php or template file.  You may have some css work since the widget might be some certain size and not fit into your area or whatever but you can figure that out.If you never call the wordpress loop then index.php will display whatever static HTML you want and you can do whatever you like with it as if it were a static site.,Wordpress,d87ufcp,4,t5_2qhjq

Go to and open the style.css file inside you wordpress folder    wpcontentthemesflatsomestyle.css  or  wpcontentthemesflatsomecssstyle.css    Find inside the line that contains   .accountuser  ... some styles ...    Now add you own style below that   .accountuser .userid  display none      Save and upload the style.css file back to the server. Go update your browser page with user account and vila. This is quick and dirty way to hide the user ID from displaying. Not the best way  which would be to edit the template files and remove code that generates that ID in the first place.

10364549,0,t3_5of1v8,If Network Solutions is your domains current registrar it might be easier and cheaper in the short run to keep it with them.  Are they also your DNS provider?  If so you can avoid any transferreregistration fees from moving the domain to a new registrar.  Your domain registration period will expire eventually and closer to that time but certainly not after! P you can consider moving your domain to a new registrar.  The process sounds intimidating but with most any modern registrar it can either be done through a webinterface or via emailticket requests to their support teams.As to where you should host the actual files and database used by Wordpress Id say that depends on what youre looking for out of your host provider and your experience maintaining a hosting environment.  Are you mainly concerned with producing content on your site and would rather not or otherwise have no real need to fiddle with things beyond the Wordpress admin?   is a great place to start to see if the platform is right for you before you dive headfirst into hosting your own Wordpress environment.  With any plan beyond the free option you can use your own domain with the Wordpress setup they provide.  Plus I hear the guys who run that site know at least a thing or two about this platform If youre looking to go allout and want complete control over your Wordpress setup then there are plenty of excellent guides that will work with most host providers.  This can be more costly however in both time investment and the actual cost of operating the serversenvironment.  So if youre trying to minimize costs and timeexperienceneeded to roll your own Wordpress.org environment Wordpress.com might be your way to go.This all being said there are a million different ways to do this.
