Thats slowed down a bit for the holidays.Were all either students or employed so scheduling is sometimes an issue but our plan is to do at least two serious ranked sessions a week  games per session. Ideally more but two is our bare minimum.As far as seriousness re competitiveness were all committed to getting better in a team environment. We play our fair share of solo queue and watch the LCS matches and some of us watch the Korean games too. We make an effort to understand what we did wrong and how we can do better.,TeamRedditTeams,cehii96,1,t5_2sx2c

I am always willing to communicate and improve often in my games Ill acknowledge my own mistakes and am open to any feedback. In game my strengths as an ADC are positioning focus and dueling while as support it is peeling and team fight initiation My biggest weakness as an ADC is freezing the lane. Its just something I havent exactly practiced and am not sure on how to properly do it. I am open to someone teaching me of course.  As a support it is a lane partner who cannot capitalize on the plays I attempt.Edit Its best to contact me through PM or Skype which I can give in a PM just because I only frequently play with my friends and usually not on in the client.,TeamRedditTeams,ceiyq9q,1,t5_2sx2c

And none of my friends ever have time to duo with me anymore. I just hate solo queue so much cause its a hassle to carry as a support with a terrible adc in low ELOs.

I mean a low level team dont need so much management so what is the point of having you ?  signing up for tournaments is easy planning trainings too so...  What is the mindset of this ? Reaching high level tournaments offline one ? Simply making a team to do a few tournaments online ones? The  ranking pool  you are looking for is quite wide  from silver to plat...  do you plan on making different rosters allowing internal team practises  or just mixing all together ? Do you aim to create it as casual team just the team nothing more or a more  pro one website all that stuff ?Sorry for the huge number of questions thanks in advance for the answers and good luck creating your team.,TeamRedditTeams,cgbgs49,2,t5_2sx2c

I have been wanting to play on a team for a while now and every team Ive been on either hasnt been committed or disbanded via issues. What do you feel you bring to the team?  I feel like I bring a fun personality as well as a strong solo laner that requires little help from our own jungler lane depending of course which allows for him to get mid or bottom rolling since they can snowball a game faster. List off known weaknesses  I like to farm a lot so I need to take a step back sometimes and look at the bigger scale of where I need to be then just what farm I need to get. I also have a tendency to get quiet a lot during stressful situations so any shotcalling that I may need to do can sometimes be really good but other times be nonexistant. If I dont have to shotcall it would be nice.

I got over losing a long time ago and Im able to keep a level head and make good decisions without any trouble. Criticism both giving and receiving is not an issue Im used to it and as long as its done respectfully I have no trouble with it.Weaknesses My biggest weakness would be my indecisiveness. I can generally make a good play in the heat of the moment and if I think I can make a play Ill commit straight to it but in terms of shotcalling and making a general call within the game I struggle with that.Team Experience The most recent team I played on was with a friend of mine along with  of his friends. We regularly played against high D and Challenger players back before Masters was introduced when  LP D was considered about as good as Challenger including Team Green Forest a thenChallenger team who played in the Promotion Tournament to the NACS.How familiar are you with the meta? ?

I doubt you do any of those things. And understanding how to transition a lead into a victory is like the benchmark of being able to play a champion. Id wager you arent as good on Anivia as you think if you cant even carry youre teammates. Basically what im saying is this game is MUCH MUCH more than vs and even laning phase.
