668406,0,t3_21s8yy,If a woman is pregnant she is supposed to limit eating too much fish to limit the amount of mercury in her system. My son asked me why do fish have mercury? I though about this for a bit and mercury is pretty heavy so why would normal mercury in the environment end up in high concentration in fish? We searched it a bit and one of the answers we found was that the mercury likely results from the burning of coal to produce power. I guess I had previously stumbled on some data that suggested more mercury is released into the atmosphere burning coal to power an incandescent light bulb than is contained in a CFL but the impact of it never came full circle for me until then.Some people say mercury is connected to the rising rates of autism.  The source of the mercury might not just be from environmental exposure but there is probably reason to be concerned with the toxins that coal power plants are spewing into the atmosphere. ,tech,cgg8wiz,1,t5_2qh48

883686,0,t3_2479gw,I am just Copypasting what i posted on rfirefox Its very sad a UI change introduced needs an immediate counter with an addon When FF . UI was pushed IIRC there was some solid datas and accompanying video which detailed why certain changes are made found the video    you can see he keeps insisting the changes are CUSTOMIZABLE  and how everything was more refined. And here is the reasoning for new Australis Curved Tab   OOMore here     must see...I loved it personally. But current Australis...? The padding is horrible. To satisfy Touch interface users ? The curved tab. For users who have multiple tabs open  its going to consume lots of space the extra curves. The Highlighting of single tab and fadding others with no clear demarcation is going to be real pain  with just pure text all over making it difficult to find where one tab ends .Eg   What is wrong with the bookmark ? Do we really need two icons ?  Where is customization when i cant even move my Menu button ?I wish they kept the UI and made changes on menu button customization which looks very promising but very limited or constrained in space . The ability to tuck all icons and use them using one button is a really good idea and way forwad. But the icon spacing within the menu button is pretty big and default icons suggest copy paste cut they are designed more towards touch UI  might be     rather than having desktop users in mind. Even though they can be removed  still one can find where the motive it towards. The New Fad is MobileTouch UI and everyone seems to ship something out to show they are there leaving behind the desktop users. MS has already backed out and promised changes. Its always better to two varied software which caters to each UI users rather than sandwich or try to find a middle ground for two different UI and come out with crap.,tech,ch4q8dp,16,t5_2qh48

The plasma acceleration structures are created either using ultrashort laser pulses or energetic particle beams that are matched to the plasma parameters. These techniques offer a way to build high performance particle accelerators of much smaller size than conventional devices The basic concepts of plasma acceleration and its possibilities were originally conceived by Toshiki Tajima and Prof. John M. Dawson of UCLA in .  Initial designs of experiment for wakefield were conceived at UCLA.  Current experimental devices show accelerating gradients several orders of magnitude better than current particle accelerators.gtgtImage iInteresting List of plasma physics articles | Plasma physics | Ponderomotive force | Particle accelerator Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwciaio oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteciaio.

Over the years displacement has been increased and turbocharging has been added.gtWankel engines can be classified by their geometric size in terms of radius rotor center to tip distance also the median stator radius and depth rotor thickness and offset crank throw eccentricity also  the difference between stators major and minor axes. These metrics function similarly to the bore and stroke measurements of a piston engine Displacement is radiusoffsetdepth multiplied with the number of rotors note that this only counts a single face of each rotor as the entire rotors displacement. Nearly all Mazda production Wankel engines share a single rotor radius mm .in with a mm .in crankshaft offset. The only engine to diverge from this formula was the rare A which used a mm .in rotor radius and .mm .in crankshaft offset.gtMazda rotary engines have a reputation for being relatively small and powerful with the expense of poor fuel efficiency.

1360954,0,t1_cimt2bf,Out of curiosity then why are we not d printing monolithic domes?My understanding of the process is that. A dome is inflated. Insulation is sprayed to the inside of the dome.

They already use people on cherry pickers I think why not just put a hose on the cherry picker and put it in a spiral? That only requires DOF for a dome with uniform radius. Thats even in an environment conducive to computer visual inspection of the final product. Step  could be automated if you had a way to bend the metal to form.

So I can tell you first hand this chemistry sucks to work with. Ill be extremely surprised if it ever becomes mainstream. Producing LiS batteries is extremely labor intensive and its extremely difficult to get anywhere close to the theoretical energy density. In my case it was because the cathode becomes extremely brittle after it dries rendering much of it unusable. To counter this graphite is put into the mix to hold it all together. The cathode usually winds up being at least  graphite by weight which drastically lowers the energy density of the cathode. We couldnt even get our LiS batteries energy density to match a standard lithium ion battery.Unless someone else has an easier way of producing the LiS cathodes I dont see these batteries ever working.tldr Worked in LiS batteries and while the chemistry is good in theory they totally suck.,tech,cklryxw,5,t5_2qh48

2169423,0,t3_2jw1d4,I just got fiber. And the higher uploads mean that uploading to cloud services works way better. And that means the service as a whole works way better. So my guess is that online servies will become more and more tied in our everyday lives.I am a bit of a securityprivicy freak and really NOT a fan of this migration to the cloud. But it is what it is. People like it. It is a logical development and it isnt going to stop.But there is also a bright side. Since I have a lot of bandwith  at home I can run my own OwnCloud server. And it will work just as fast as Dropbox Google Drive OneDrive or any other professional cloud service. The same goes for hosting my own email or anything else.Faster broadband will make people move more and more into the cloud. But it will also give people who dont like the cloud to do it themselves. To move away from it. It will also make sharing content among friends much easier and practical. Think about sharing stuff via Bittorrent Sync or sharing media with PlexThe harder the copyright agencies hit on sharing the more peole will move to the old fashion way of sharing. Handing down external hardrives full of content within private circles. But since broad will be abundant physical harddrives will be replaced with shared media on private servers and PCs.Lot of this is going on for years. More broadband will make it happen a lot more.,tech,clfl1qx,139,t5_2qh48

2171382,0,t1_clfpxzx,Lets put the numbers in that!Now a fiber connection at  gigabit per secondgbps is going at . GigaByte per second GBps or MBps assuming GB  MB. This though is raw speed a good chunk of that speed is lost on errors and drops which require resend package wrapping which allows for correction of errors and protocol packages sending those AWKs consume a bit of bandwidth but it can add up. Some more reasonable highend number would be  MBs it could further be increased to  MBps but this would require reconfiguring the whole internet that wont probably happen and also LANlike latencies which certainly wont happen. Add the greater loss of packages due to higher distances which only gets worse as you optimized for speed and you realize that MBs is really optimistic.This is faster than a slow RPM disk Notice that a nicer but still reasonably priced disk offers comparable speeds But if we still care about having huge amounts of memory at blazing speeds as youd need editing video that simply cannot all fit in RAM youd be able to use SSD were MBs is shitty This is ignoring grabbing multiple drives and putting them on RAID which can speed up to twice as much.A Gbps connection sounds a lot better but then again. It think that assuming that anyone can have Gbps is looking too much ahead at some point increasing bandwidth will not increase throughput speed as much due to latency and the speed of light is kind of as fast as we can go. There will be many challenges in achieving an internet with Gbps endtoend point speed Ive been assuming Gbps endtoend speed which is quite optimistic.I think that games will still be plausible but given how heavy textures can be and how heavy a game can be even with Gbps therell be a benefit to be able to install a local copy. I can see some content being moved to the cloud maps and such but not all of it textures and such.For light use programs we might see things moving to the cloud fully and people using a laptop with a small SSD which mostly works as a cache for the cloud.

Either way I will respond earnestly.I cant speak for other agencies but we do not have a quota or whatever clever euphemism one would like to call it performance goals enforcement metrics etc.As for inventing offenses it just doesnt have to be done. If one really wishes to write tickets they could spend the whole shift doing so because I have noticed over my  years that a great many drivers routinely drive  miles per hour over the speed limit roll through stop signs run red lights drive left of center or weave and tailgate. Each one of those offenses are potentially hazardous.I supervise an entire shift of officers who would rather prevent crime than write a ticket but we all try to encourage safe driving behavior and will target areas where crashes occur and utilize high visibility to oppress the motoring public into refraining from many of these hazardous moving violations. Depending on the severity of the offense drivers can expect to receive a verbal warning written warning or a citation. That just makes sense to me.TLDR  not all agencies have quotas. In my experience only cash strapped cities with their own Municipal Courts or Mayors Courts do because they actually see significant amounts of revenue from citations. Sheriffs Offices and certain other agencies do not.,tech,clm1g8l,2,t5_2qh48

Most of that asymmetrical data youre talking about flows over paid private peering links.It became clear in the late s that content providers which deliver highly asymmetrical data such as video would wreak havoc on public peering links both due to the rapid rate at which their bandwidth grows the inefficiency of delivering largely identical data over long distances and the inevitable outages caused by usage spikes. The solution was to build content distribution networks which plug their servers directly into the ISP networks at numerous locations all over the world. It cuts the transit networks and their peering links out of the picture reduces latency reduces competition with regular data and lowers costs for the content providers.,tech,cln8pn5,1,t5_2qh48

Im not sure if youre aware but receipt paper is a source of BPA exposure.  In fact its a big spike in BPA in the bloodstream every time you touch one.  You might lose people like me from wanting to buy one simply because Im not keen on exposing myself to BPA constantly.

3592912,0,t1_cq10jv9,Nope and nope.   Interconnectivity seems a nice idea but it poses significant risks. First of all you cant rely on it.   As long as a single nonsmart car is on the road you cant use interconnectivity to decide what is a car and where it is for short range purposes. As long as nonsmart cars are a significant fraction of the total not even long range purposes like traffic data to avoid high traffic areas are feasible.  Lets not even consider hacking and spoofing of said functionality.  It is feasible to imagine a dedicated traffic network to become a thing in the far future  years but all bets are good on such a long time.Remote updates are another giant security hole.   A problem in the software the car ships with would be really bad fatal desing flaw bad and would probably get the producer fined.   It would also be impossible to guarantee updates being applied just look at java on PC today so running stock or outdated would HAVE to be always viable.   Updates would probably be in the ballpark of  GB each so good luck doing them wifi.   Stuff like the GPS software would have to be completely separated from the car AI to prevent accidents bugs security problems and to avoid a crash in one taking down the other.Ah and a small fraction of the US is not the whole world. Not even all the US would have good coverage to always allow the car to be connected so those ideas are even dumber.,tech,cq1thuv,1,t5_2qh48

I have no idea how much it would cost to charge a Leaf for say k miles per year. But for the sentra assuming about mph and gas of .gal thats yr or  over  years. Youve still spent k less buying and operating the ICE car than it would be just to buy the Leaf and replace the batteries  years later. gtWe can push the tech all we want but the reality is that we need to start considering as a species that owning your own car and driving long distances by yourself might not be the best for the environment.I also argue that we should use the tech available to us to give us the lifestyle we want. For example there is enough thorium to create enough electricity for everyone in the world at x the current US individual which is the highest for like  years. But people would rather say conserve energy that will solve the problem.

A vote that can be checked by yourself means the vote is linked to a person. This means that someone else can force you to show you your vote. Whether thats an employer or an abusive husband or anyone else is irrelevant. The fact is that a vote should not be verifyably tied to a person.Votes being anonymous means they CANNOT be traced back to a person. You being able to recheck your own vote is completely against this principle.gt This is falseHash collision. You can google it yourself.Theres hundreds of examples. Heres one for MD   This is for MD but the principle of hash collisions holds for any hashing method. Again Its nontrivial but hashing by its very nature means that you cannot prove there isnt a possible hashcollision.There are examples of hashcollissions in executable files as well in case you wanted to bring that up. Heres an example again for MD because its relatively more trivial than other hashing methods Realtime voting means its easier to tie a vote to a person with metadata.

They have repeatedly lost control of records each of those times and have still not learned from their mistakes.Recently the exact same thing happened to the organization used to process security clearances.  Target lost financial details because their HVAC was connected to the same systems that had access to that data.  Payment processors responsible for processing Visa MasterCard and American Express debit amp credit cards have been repeatedly compromised losing everything needed to rack charges up on those cards without the card owners being notified.Let me put it like this  these companies dont learn from their mistakes.  Programmers still regularly write programs with buffer overflows which is something weve known about and how to fix for decades.  Not only do they not learn but theres no financial motivation to fix these things.In an ideal world companies would learn from this.

My parents and siblings and our respective families rented an airbnb house in the Bay Area over a long weekend for a wedding a couple months ago we chose this over the more expensive less convenient alternative of getting  hotel rooms. Now would it really be that much better for society if the owner of this house rented it out or sold it to some uppermiddle class family to live long term vs. renting it out to people like us?

A device with an x compatible CPU e.g. an Intel Atom running Windows should be able to run to run a lot of software commonly used by businessesthe full Microsoft Office suite for example.Since its not uncommon for some people to mostly just need Office and email in their jobs I can see continuum being a success in business and enterprise devices as it basically reduces the number of devices an employer needs to provide by half no PC needed if employees phone supports continuum and they dont need powerful hardware.,tech,cupa7x3,5,t5_2qh48

Its between the merchant and the credit card company.Now as to what youre actually asking about Its a Discover Card promotion. They are giving a bonus  cash back on any purchase made with Apple Pay through the end of the year and if you have a new account they double your cash back after  months. The scam absolutely isnt against your store at all. They just need ways to spend thousands of dollars over the next few months and the gift cards can then be fairly easily liquidated. Theyre essentially buying money with money and getting  cash back to do so. After the first day Discover updated the terms to explicitly exclude gift cards from the promotion but how and how well that will be enforced is the  question. Its important to realize however that while they may be trying to cheat Discover out of some incredibly stupidly? generous cash back nobody is doing anything nefarious to the store itself.

TFA is pointing out that if you can reverse engineer the pricing system youd have an advantage over other market participants and that obscurity is a potential flaw in the Uber model that is not present in AirBnB or Ebay or even in the regulated taxi market in many places.Uber may end up having to open its pricing or let drivers set their own rates if they dont want the states to keep ruling that the drivers are actually employees.

Its better that a community decides rather than some central authority with an unknown agenda. If you want a curated space it needs to be advertised as such.

As long as you keep your traffic low it will cost you nothing and its entirely not worth the time and effort of the security team to bother trying to detectblock VPNs with a very small user base in this case the userbase should be  you.Youre not fully anonymous anymore since you can no longer pay for machine time with Amazon gift cards although that was a great method back in the day but from the perspective of the sites youre visiting you might as well be.,tech,d0dry80,0,t5_2qh48

Any type of router configuration is going to be beyond most normal users. The best free alternative to Teamviewer is chrome remote desktop imo.My suggestion would be for anyone giving friends and family support would be to enable some sort of VPN functionality into their networking make sure RDP is turned on all the machines and then you can RDP after you connect via VPN. Many consumer grade routers offer pretty good client VPN functionality out of the box but that is not a given on all routers hence the good router comment. Combine this with a Dynamic DNS service asus routers have this built in and you do not need to worry about their public IP changing.

Finally my car has a satellite radio which is maybe  of my music listening.Your entire argument rests on the idea that most people listen to music on their phone all the time. Im not at all convinced thats true. My argument isnt that theres better options for listening to music on their phone its that a ton of people dont even need that feature.The examples I keep introducing are FM tuners IR transceivers and wireless charging. If your phone doesnt have those features then theres no good alternative except it turns out most people dont want those features and most phones get away without providing them.If someone doesnt give a shit about a feature you dont need a better alternative to convince them to buy your device.gt What? This makes no sense. The third option for widespread personal audio transmission is dont use headphones? I cant tell if youre being intentionally obtuse or not.Theres always an option to just not do it. My theory is that most people already dont use headphones with a phone if they listen to music theyre usually doing it in a situation where they have better options car home work.It may be that most people who use headphones with a phone use the .mm port but if very few people use headphones with a phone then its still reasonable to remove it.,tech,d4jekib,1,t5_2qh48

It is actually OK for Labor to die eventually. It wont be in our lifetime but more on that further below since its a bit OT. Youre right that its not practical to tell laborers to get smart and do incredibly complex things. Those individuals have to pursue the collection of knowledge and learning. This causes demand for vocational schools to pop up so people can be trained for the jobs. This is what college should prep you for but its broken for a variety of reasons currently. Part of whats wrong with extended education in the USA are these general purpose degrees  where people are left on their own to develop a specialization thats in demand.

I would probably turn those off if they were any security risk at all however. I also never use my real name online though thats partially due to the fact that my online personality defines me much more than my physical one.I dont really care about privacy with many other things however.

Someone else mentioned a world Wide cellular based Internet service that would be cheap and gave unlimited data. A fuel replacement that could be made in any high school chemistry lab that any car could use as is or with simple modification could make a fortune doing that mod cheap... How about investing in developing alternative battery technology to replace lithium ion batteries cheaply. Pull together as many people as possible to develop alternative power generation something that might replace coal for the bulk of our power generation ideally cheaper than existing tech so I can sale it cheaper and still make a profit. Not a technology idea but would do alot of good. Invest in roads and highways in Africa and South America with utility lines along side them. To allow better trade and travel across the landmass. Invest in water desalination technology and build as many plants as possible try to reduce the dangerous water shortages planet wide. Build self sufficient facilities that could hold hundreds if not thousands of people as well as copies of as much information technology and culture as possible spread thought the world a backup in case of a world wide collapse similar to the dark ages. Seeds of civilization if you will If I am building a wish list here. How about we start an organization to collect collate and cross reference all information we have developed as the human race so far. the number of stories about a someone spending years looking for a solution to an issue and the answer was known by people in another field they had never thought about I could probably think of a few more but we are well past all reasonable limits here... ,tech,d7qundi,3,t5_2qh48

Theres several examples of ancient currencies simply dropping the sub unit think if the US simply stopped using amounts less than one dollar but it was at a point where there were simply no remaining cases where it made sense to use an amount less than the main unit.

For years the Washington Post NYTimes Financial Times and others let you read all of their articles free mo questions asked. That time has passed.They simply cannot make enough from online ad revenue to keep the lights on even when they resort to low quality tabloidlike content and clickbait headlines to drive traffic. Investigative journalism takes weeks or months to publish a well researched story.But in the adfunded business model  page story   ad impression which is a very poor ROI for something that took weeksmonths of salaries and healthcare costs to create. It becomes easier and ultimately necessary to replace  word deep dives with   word  articles that provide a trickle of information and lack the analysis and nuance that is essential to having an informed readership.  Most people are using ad blockers today anyway and that has a lot to do with the fact that these newapapers do not vet ads like they do on their print versions. They instead hand that responsibility over to garbage ad networks like Taboola Outbrain and Adsense that bring you relevant targeted content you never asked to see.

After yrs you have a nice anchor salary history brand credibility from working in the hot area and your skills have improved at least at much as if youd worked elsewhere.

If youre mediocre the temporary move is a great shot in the arm professionally.,tech,dg13x9b,3,t5_2qh48
11625512,0,t1_dgdqsnu,My point is that it is extremely unlikely for this methodology to work out. That even if you are passing the classes and think that it is working out it may still not be and you will have to start over or give up after investing considerable time. I dont want you finding out  months down the line when you are doing the harder classes that it actually didnt work and have you give up because you already invested too much time and its a sunk cost which is likely to happen since you wont know if it is working until that point.You by definition of not knowing it yet cannot say if it is possible to truly learn the information of courses in a short time period. And you will not be able to assess if it is working until you have invested a large amount of time into it.The people giving you this advice myself included are far more qualified to say that you should NOT start with the cramming path and that you should take the path of multiple subjects over an extended period of time.If you take the cramming path I am willing to bet  Bitcoin that you will either not complete the courses or be able to do a fairly simple project that I give you after you finish the curriculum.You will have wasted your time and not have a good quality education.If you start with the multiple subjects at the same time over a longer period you will still take the same amount of time in total maybe a month or two longer but you will actually receive a good quality education from it.That is my point which you are avoiding and refusing to listen to. ,tech,dgdri53,1,t5_2qh48
