1290788,0,t3_28lb5o,This isnt a valid reason to install a tow hook take everyone elses advice and tow the car behind a truck.The only valid reason to install a tow hook is for towing track tires and stuff to the race track. Having seen a number of Zs with this setup you can buy a tow hook for the Z but it merely bolts onto the what I am guessing is aluminum bumper. Eventually it will cause a failure either of the tow hook or the bumper or the attachment of the bumper to the unibody. So the unit has to be modified at install time to also tie into the rear subframe.So for what you are doing just rent the truck and trailer and go.

2552995,0,t3_2ovxwn,One thing I dont see on that engine is valve covers  which is normal for buying a long block so I assume theyre going to reuse your existing ones.  There is a tendency for the gaskets on the valve covers to leak oil into the spark plug wells and you cant replace just the gaskets well.. you can but it involves drilling out the valve covers and doing some hacky shit.  Its not a big deal labor wise if it happens later but they do nail you on the price of them.  For that much money though... I dont know seems like theyd include that especially since theyre moving them over anyway itd be no more labor to put on new ones vs the old ones.  Arguably less labor since they wouldnt have to scrape the crazy tenacious Nissan RTV off the old one.As for being cost effective.... Its certainly in the gray area.  You could certainly swap heads for less money but if you did that youd be on the same block wouldnt have the opportunity to do the clutchflywheel etc.,350z,cmrtadi,1,t5_2t3vy

On my Acura my upper control arm seized and was rubbing on the wheel and made a nasty noise at  mph and above. Stick your hand in your wheel well and feel around your tire for anything almost touching your wheel.

Its obvious the OP is a fairly new driver since hes asking this question.
