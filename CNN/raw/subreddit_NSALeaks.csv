513803,0,t1_cfyn7lw,gtYes I do. Here is a good explanation of the Direct Access. This article cites nothing from Snowden directly. It says that the first articles written by two publications were inaccurate in that they claimed the NSA had direct access to the companies servers. He then goes on to say that they edited their articles at a later date to rephrase this saying that it was a program of cooperation. FTAgtgtGot that? Its no longer an established fact as originally presented that the NSA can directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies servers as The Guardian put it or pull out anything it likes as the Post claimed originally.Where is your source that these were claims from Edward Snowden? They were claims made by the news outlets that published the PRISM documents provided by Snowden and they subsequently edited them to report on the situation more factually.gtNext here is the claim about Authority Number ...FTA quote by SnowdengtgtAny analyst at any time can target anyone.... Where those communications will be picked up depends on the range of the sensor networks and the authorities that that analyst is empowered with. Not all analysts have the ability to target everything. But I sitting at my desk certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone From you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president if I had a personal email.It would appear to me that Snowden is incorrect here as Michael Hayden the former head of the NSA and CIA claims. It wouldnt seem that the system is set up so a lowlevel contractor has the authority to wiretap anyone he wished. He was some form of systems administrator not an analyst. Perhaps he was confusing authority with ability? Clearly it would seem he had the ability to wiretap anyone he wished. The guy found a way to take approximately . million top secret documents after all.The only explanation I can offer is that perhaps he misspoke as it was a verbal interview available here  Regarding  the NSA operator seems rather confident in the technical limits that would prevent someone like Snowden from obtaining the surveillance information. Why then was Snowden able to overcome the technical limits that secured all those mega top secret documents?gtgtTherefore my skepticism goes both ways. I dont think that . million number is true but if Ellsberg is right Snowden took around k NSA files  k GCHQ files  k Aussie Intel files. Hence there is NO WAY he could have vetted each one of those documents.gtI carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest he said. There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didnt turn over because harming people isnt my goal. Transparency is.gtThats just not possible and hence my skepticism.If its a few hundred thousand...I think its possible. It depends entirely on what he means by evaluated. What if there were  files in a folder that was neatly categorized to contain highlevel presentations would he consider grabbing the whole folder to be evaluating every single document? I think its fine to criticize him for not going into more detail on this but consider also that he disclosed it to journalists who he tasked with disclosing it in a responsible way. What has he leaked that has put people at risk? Its also possible that the numbers as you said are very inaccurate. It would be in the NSAs best interest to say that he stole millions of documents which he couldnt possibly have evaluated personally.So far I dont see evidence to suggest that he exaggerates anything. The first article wasnt about Snowdens claims but journalists. The second was a factual inaccuracy where he appeared to claim that he had the authority to wiretap anyone. I tend to believe this was a mistake as he wasnt an NSA analyst nor did anyone believe hed have the authority to do such a thing. Why would he claim that systems administrators who are contractors have the authority to wiretap anyone? Has he repeated this outlandish claim elsewhere? A second data point would make it far more likely that your interpretation is correct that it was not a mistake in a verbal interview.gtSave the strawman. I initially mocked the notion that Snowdens words are the irrefutable truth. You responded with a misdirection about his credibility. You can be credible and still not get all the facts right. So when Snowden says he told at least  people I first question the number of people and wonder how many of these people were managerial.Where did I say his words were the irrefutable truth? Ironic that you bring up strawmen a sentence before you make one yourself.Its fine to doubt that claim. Youre probably not going to see any evidence of it however because we know the nature of the NSA is to prevent the public from learning of the unconstitutional abuses they perpetrate on a daily basis. We can also look to former NSA whistleblowers who have come out and said that they were ignored and that Snowden did the right thing as using the system would only mean that these abuses would be swept under the rug. Past whistleblowers have also noted that their lives have been seriously damaged by malicious personal prosecution against them as punishment for whistleblowing. NSA officials also perjure themselves before their oversight committees. Do you think they give a fuck about internal reports of abuse when theyre note even beholden to federal officials?gtThe pictureperfect whistleblower would take enough to make their point and not just ransack swathes of records across various subjects.Harsh criticism for someone who put his life and possibly his families lives on the line to expose the worlds largest most unconstitutional spying apparatus in history. But still I guess we have to conclude hes not a pictureperfect whistleblower. Who is? Plus the entire deck is stacked against him.gtBUT....Snowdens actions and motives dont get a free pass for me nor do I believe without question what he says. My skepticism goes both ways and I dont think his intentions were merely noble. I think it was in part but that he wanted to humiliate the NSA and that irks me. I think its a good intention to not give him a free pass just because youre inclined to believe with what hes said so far. To blindly believe what someone says is dangerous. I hope this post made it clear that its not what Im doing either but it seems that I come down on the side of giving him more credibility such that Im willing to believe minor claims like I tried raising this issue internally  times without direct evidence simply on the basis that . its a minor claim and . his revelations todate have been generally supported by evidence e.g. see my above interpretation. I should make it clear that if he were to make an extreme claim such as the NSA has a backdoor in every computer I would absolutely require evidence before simply believing it.

Any state that has the capacity to monitor all its citizenry any state that has the ability to snuff out factual public debate through control of information any state that has the tools to instantly shut down all dissent is totalitarian. Our corporate state may not use this power today. But it will use it if it feels threatened by a population made restive by its corruption ineptitude and mounting repression. The moment a popular movement arisesand one will arisethat truly confronts our corporate masters our venal system of total surveillance will be thrust into overdrive....gt gt Lies are told not to achieve any discernable goal of public policy but to protect the image of the state and its rulers.

The states ability through comprehensive surveillance to prevent outside inquiry into the exercise of power engenders a terrifying intellectual and moral sclerosis within the ruling elite...gt gt We like those in all emergent totalitarian states have been mentally damaged by a carefully orchestrated historical amnesia a stateinduced stupidity. We increasingly do not remember what it means to be free. And because we do not remember we do not react with appropriate ferocity when it is revealed that our freedom has been taken from us. The structures of the corporate state must be torn down. Its security apparatus must be destroyed. And those who defend corporate totalitarianism including the leaders of the two major political parties fatuous academics pundits and a bankrupt press must be driven from the temples of power.

1294374,0,t1_cied6pb,On the topic of whether it is appropriate for the sub Id first like to say I appreciate that you are working with a more horizontal organization model. I think subreddits are best served by moderators when everyone gets an equal voice in what should and shouldnt be appropriate submissions and the moderators act as executors of the will of the majority rather than making that choice themselves. If only democracies worked this way they wouldnt be halfbad.In terms of the drones themselves your summary of how they fit into the increasing surveillance capabilities and militarization of local enforcement is excellent. They are of course scaryour exploiters plan to enforce consent with robots that violently assault those who challenge this exploitation but in a small way I see this as a positive these corporate entities and the executors of their will are scared.Thanks to the proliferation of a more free and open source of information viz. the internet I believe more people than ever are aware of the exploitation which serves as the backbone of late capitalism where we see everincreasing consolidation of wealth and power at the top. They are preparing for protests because they plan to continue to push deregulation government subsidies for big industry and for the promulgation of other business practices that exploit the working class. If anything though I feel the actual use of these drones would only incite greater outrage.Its maybe not the most positive point of view but I believe things will have to get a little bit worse before they can get better. Occupy coincided with the recession for a reason. The neglect of the poor in Brazil in exchange for spending billions on infrastructure to host the World Cup much of that money lost to fraudulent running up of expenses brought on the biggest protests in a while there. The people at the top wont stop pushing so I only see it as a matter of time until this unsustainable economic model goes through another collapse.Laissezfaire capitalism in practice ultimately serves to reinvent a fuedal system where perhaps you have your choice of exploiter but if you are not born an upperclass citizen you have exponentially less chance of becoming one. You will work hard and struggle while a select few the vast majority born into wealth earn extraordinarily more than sometimes even dozens of people would need to support themselves comfortably. Life becomes dictated by their terms both economically and politically.To keep itself alive the myth of a levelplaying field has to be perpetuated which if you look at the number of poor Republicans and libertarians is obviously not so hard a thing to do. With television and its system of manufactured consent the perpetuation of the myths of unbridled capitalism used to be even easier but with the diminishing middle class in almost every country worldwide and the increased accessibility of independent media I believe there is growing discontent see the US Congress  approval rating a historic low.The global surveillance state is not about terrorism. The surveillance state is a new way to monitor and control dissent. Whether its monitoring online discussions so you can flood them with progovernment sentiment see China paying people to do this being able to block access to certain information or communication services see increasing worldwide censorship Obamas attacks on the free press plans for new Internet kill switches or making complete political communication and webhistory based profiles on people especially activists those on top are looking to monitor control and squash dissent. If the Internet can be closed down like television much of this problem goes away or if it can be used as a spying device to thwart any plans of enemies of the state as well even better.Ill stop ranting now. Im probably just preaching to the choir anyway.,NSALeaks,cif8fdt,2,t5_2yh6a

Under current conditions it wouldnt be a fair trial however.After all he exposed and after what has happened to the ones before him..I cant believe people still think this would ever be a good idea and that he would ever receive a fair trial..,NSALeaks,cw06aa5,3,t5_2yh6a
5641952,0,t3_3sdtfg,What really kind of disgusts me and really screams of treason is our special relationship with the Brits. They are still dominated by the same god damned family that America gained its independence from and here we are fraternizing with the enemy. Please dont reply with nonsense about the queen and royal family being tourist props. If so take their illicitly acquired shit and pay them a reenacters wage and make them go to their home that they pay for from their salary each night just like a regular person. ,NSALeaks,cwwfslv,3,t5_2yh6a

Even though with the unprecedented surveillance power they already have they completely failed to stop this one.  Generally when someone drops the ball you dont hand them even more balls.,NSALeaks,cx2tv5b,4,t5_2yh6a

6861057,0,t1_d0ttwsw,What I dont get about the email scandal is why it would make a difference if the emails that passed through Hillarys illegal private email server were considered classified or not. The emails contained what would later be considered classified information anyway which means all those now classified documents contained in the emails were at risk of being picked up by pretty much anyone that wanted to hack into the server the whole time right?Two obvious things stick out to me.. The private email server was not something she could legally be operating from as Secretary of State. Hillary broke the law plain and simple yes?. The emails were  at risk of being seen by hackers regardless of whether or not any hackers actually saw them. That sounds like a direct threat to our national security no matter how you spin it if you ask me. ,NSALeaks,d0u0dm5,4,t5_2yh6a

8977004,0,t3_538ul6,gtAn emotional core a revelatory leadactor performance from Joseph GordonLevitt and a surprisingly snappy treatment of various highlevel technologies all feed into a true film surprise. The film wont add much information insight or color for anybody who has closely followed stories about the NSAs most famous whistleblower though there is a little bit but for those who have only peeked at the headlines Snowden wonderfully sells the premise of why his disclosures matteredand how the leaker himself is a meaningful part of the full story.Balanced but positive review.
