1945582,0,t3_2gyfna,Im sorry I came to like and trust Keller at the end of last season but I just cant help but feel that he is out of his depth. Parking the bus and running away with points vs. Bayern and Chelsea do not outweigh losing to Gladbach Hannover and most of all Dresden fucking rd division Dresden. Blame injuries but if you look our attacking lineups are still very solid we should be scoring much more. I feel like Im watching a small team play when I see Schalke it is time like we start playing like the second largest club in Germany. ,schalke04,cknn7d1,3,t5_2t2g0

2625972,0,t1_cn1c779,I think De Jong is a good alternative at this point. Has been hinted at already and his contract runs out in the summer. Hes a starter for Milan though. He is a fighter always something you want on Schalke but also has strengths in opening up a game and playing a deadly pass. Maybe a CB rumors about Nastasic but he seems to be injured too much which we already have trouble with great player that would really help us though.Heldt already said theyd think about moving a summer transfer to winter and if they did theyd try and have him on the team before the departure for Qatar th of January so we might see them soon,schalke04,cn1cn0v,3,t5_2t2g0

Meyer was alright but still not as great as weve seen him before. KJH still underperforming Why wasnt Uchida playing? The goal was mostly a RBCB mistake.Oh and that obvious handball of course.

4244403,0,t1_cs3yu7x,That. The unrest in the team and everything and everyone around it is so thick you can cut it with a knife. The loser of such state of affeirs is everyone involved. The fans are angry because the team underperforms. The team is angry because they cannot focus on play and they do not know who will be coaching them.Potential players who could join the team are put off by the atmosphere and refuse our offers Khedira much.I just want the team to play consistently the guys to find their pace and understand each other on and off the pitch. Simple as that.,schalke04,cs41vxr,4,t5_2t2g0

I dont know if Breitenreiters position in the club is that strong yet to make these kind of statements. He is a  fresh face in the coaching business. I just hope this wont lead to any differences between coach and management.In general its refreshing to have a coach who speaks about whats on his mind and not some meaningless PR statements.,schalke04,cuqduua,10,t5_2t2g0

5500119,0,t3_3qfl9y,I wish they had talked about this in the context of the next  matches rather than just the next one but most of it will still be applicable. TranslationFC Schalke has to do without Geis in the next  competitive matches. We explain who could take his spot.To the Bild Johannes Geis is just a Bonebreaker  the FC Schalke  sees it a bit different. They strive towards normalcy after Geis red card foul on Andr Hahn in the  loss. He unintentionally made a mistake and apologized quickly. We dont want to play down the foul he was justly punished. But in his whole career he got only  yellow cards was never suspendedbanned explains Coach Breitenreiter. Manager Horst Heldt adds Johannes is very fair boy hes very sad about the incident. dont know how to translate Betroffenheit  dismay maybe? Geis himself apologized via Facebook right after the match. Schalke was a bit surprised that the suspension was active in both the Bundesliga as well as the DFBPokal. Geis was suspend for  matches so he is also not an option for the DFBPokal match against Mnchengladbach. Andr and me have talked about it because theres the option to to object but its sensible to accept the ban punishment like this. Breitenreiter has to replace a key player. But who will do just that? There are multiple candidates.Kaan Ayhan  When Breitenreiter rested Geis in this season which didnt happen often Ayhan took his place as . Plus factor for Ayhan Hes similarly good when it comes to dead balls assisted the  against Prague. However he has little match practice. He shows a lot of dedication in training and earned all the minutes he got.  Probability Roman Neustdter   He was the undisputed  in the last years but played weak last season. Now hes center back  behind Hwedes and Matip. Plus factor for Neustdter Breitenreiter has a high opinion of him additionally he knows his exclub Mnchengladbach very well.  Probability Dennis Aogo  Aogo helped out as  under Jens Keller Roberto Di Matteo and also under Breitenreiter in the  against Wolfsburg. Plus factor for Aogo Sead Kolasinac would take over Aogos spot on the left side of the backfour  no loss in quality.  Probability Piere Emile Hjbjerg  The Bayernloanee didnt convince in any match so far even though Heldt called his performance in Mnchengladbach very good. Hjbjerg is not a classic  his strengths lie in the position. There he should be first choice since Leon Goretzka is injured.  Probability Leon Goretzka  The ExBochum player is injured. Its doubtful if he can play anyway.   Probability Joel Matip  The center back is also a good defensive midfielder Hwedes and Neustdter would take over as center backs in this variant. Breitenreiter however said No chance.   Probability ,schalke04,cweox9a,1,t5_2t2g0

6354412,0,t3_42oj9o,it looks like we are going to start another rebuilding phase this summer. Heidel will replace Heldt. There are first rumors about Breitenreiter and his methods especially training being questioned by players and the leadership which were denied publicly by Heldt  Fhrmann but I find it hard to believe that some reporters just make up those stories. So that position may be questionable.Several key players like Matip San Hwedes or Hunter are speculated to think about leaving the club. I dont like this situation at all.
