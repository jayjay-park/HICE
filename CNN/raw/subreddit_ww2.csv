The rifle rounds at the time were overkill for m and the pistol rounds were not enough.  The intermediate round of the StG  is the father of . . NATO and the .xmm AK round.  ,ww2,ck8z79g,3,t5_2s8su

8622262,0,t3_4xy2cf,He was born in Germany in  and immigrated with his parents to the United States when he was  years old. When he was old enough to enlist he was given the option of switching from his default assignment in Europe to the Pacific on account of his German origins.  He made it clear to the US Army that he was fine with fighting the Germans in Europe. This upset his parents especially considering that his dad my greatgrandfather fought in the German Army in World War I.He was trained as a sniper and he was assigned to some sort of ridiculous mission that involved sniping Germans from trees not sure about the details on this. He figured that his chances of survival were actually better if he volunteered for a risky volunteeronly reconnaissance mission instead. He was wounded on this mission when he ran into a tripwire and detonated an Smine ,ww2,d6jduav,6,t5_2s8su

To make a long story short Operations Barbarossa and Typhoon failed to achieve its objectives long before the winter set in and by the first snow fell taking Moscow was already an impossible dream for the Germans. After that the Red Army went on to win more and more resounding victories regardless of the season.,ww2,dfydrq7,8,t5_2s8su
