2270974,0,t3_2jl9e9,I just barely finished this book. Took me most of October and a couple days in November. However I didnt really get excited by it until the library then I didnt want to put it down. Maybe it took that long to finally accept Bradburys phrasing and descriptors. It did feel a little cheesy that love and laughter can fight the evil and darkness however Ive never seen cheesy put so eloquently and beautifully.

2612724,0,t3_2psgdm,I think your thought on that might change part .Trying not to give anything away there is a moment where Anna realises that shes not been paying much attention to her son and remembers how much he means to her.And Levins half brother spends a bunch of time with him in which their relationship is explored much further.However I do sense what youre getting at with these seemingly lacking familial relationships. But I wonder if that is just a trait of the aristocracy or with that particular era? Ive also felt that in stories about the working classes the family units are very tight not necessarily happy but interact a lot with each other. But in more upper class families there is a wedge of pretence perhaps that gets in the way.,bookclub,cmzmbyz,2,t5_2qktu

Scott Fitzgerald Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck The Catcher in the Rye by J.D.

4640403,0,t3_3ehc6r,Muriel Sparks Memento Mori and The Girls of Slender Means are both in my opinion as good as The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie which goes on all the century lists for English language novels. All her other novels Ive read have been as good as contemporary novels Ive picked up. Critics no less than Anthony Burgess and Frank Kermode have given the nod her other novels The Mendlebaum Gate The Only Problem and The Drivers Seat. Two others than these were shortlisted for Booker prizes.  Im currently working on some personal reading projects but I plan to return to her for these the stories and a few other novels. By the by I highly recommend her. I dont think shes widely read. Shes wickedly funny and emotionally striking in the way Nabokov is at his best. She also has a unique way of jumping casually around in time. Her novels can often be snapped up in an weekend. You can hear one her stories read on the NYer Fiction Podcast.,bookclub,ctfhnah,2,t5_2qktu

Read a pulpy book or some short stories if you dont feel like digging into a doorstop.  Reading shouldnt be a chore so dont make it one.  Take some time off and pick it back up when something sparks your interest.  Until then dont stress about it.,bookclub,ctg5zqg,3,t5_2qktu

4779647,0,t1_ctwu7he,I dont see Fieldings style as sour but I do think of his own opinions as being completely hidden. I remember reading a critic writing about satire in the th Century and the point he made was that theres a kind of contract between the author and reader. The critic was writing about Swift whose short essay A Modest Proposal outraged many readers who didnt understand that his proposal to use dead Irish babies for food wasnt real. But how would you know if you didnt get Swifts style? The same goes for Fielding writing exactly  years later. Every time  I mean every time  he expresses an opinion Im thinking  Does he really mean this? Is it a joke? Is it ironic? Does he mean the precise opposite? And I guess that nine times out of ten its one of those three.Am I enjoying the novel more than you are? I might be. I had my doubts during Books  and  but I think things are back on track now. Usually I dont like farces  I can remember even Frasier used to make me anxious if things got too embarrassing  but being in farce mode allows Fielding to do whatever he likes with the plot. And then of course he can write one of his clever chapters about how nothing he writes is implausible oh no.I know what you mean about wanting to read things again. Sometimes everything just seems to be passing me by.,bookclub,ctx0kbk,1,t5_2qktu

I have always preferred creeping uncanniness to vampires and monsters. I havent loved his other work as much though I often recommend HoL with Raw Shark Texts by Steven Hall but its not exactly horror depending on how you feel about sharks I guess as I think its...playful in a similar vein but again not exactly horror.

6338397,0,t3_42ctrj,Are you looking for straightup horror or would you like horrorslash???. Anne Bishop both her Dark Jewels and The Others series are horrorfantasy. Im uptodate on The Others and working on the Dark Jewels and so far shes avoided the horrorfantasyromance trope. Elements of romance sure but not the chapterslongdescriptions of physical romance some Urban Fantasy authors have not that theres anything wrong with that but I find most horror fans prefer to avoid that.Laurel K Hamiltons Anita Blake series is good as long as you stop with Obsidian Butterfly. Well. I didnt like it after Obsidian Butterfly.Sunnys Mona Lisa series is good. Again these are all in the same horrorfantasy vein with elements of romance.Rob Thurman is good. Kat Richardson is more urban fantasy than horror but is a real great worldbuilder.Adrienne Wilder is more horrorromance if the thought of eating someone while having sex with them appeals. Didnt for me. And while her premise is interesting I feel like more could be done to explain the politics of her world that it would truly push her novels to great rather than an edgy Mary Sue fantasy.Anyway here are some horrorfantasy authors I liked.,bookclub,cza3sy5,2,t5_2qktu

7806493,0,t3_4m8tcb, has been examined and dissected across so many schools of thought to the point where debates on the central message of the novel dont really have a right or wrong answer. Depending on how you look at the novel as a whole it can have a different underlying message for each individual reader completely separate from one another and thats okay. It seems your takeaway had more to do with the effects of indoctrination whereas the message of mass surveillance reflects on the fear that comes with awareness of the happenings of a place like AirstripOne. The uproar most likely comes from people looking at the novel as a whole with this one idea and then applying it to the world around them so when they see evidence of mass surveillance they refer back to . The problem with this in my eyes and the word Orwellian in general is that it ignores a majority of the book in order to push an agenda.So to answer your question there isnt really a right or wrong way to look at the book but its better to make your arguments on elements of the novel instead of the entire thing. I will say I find it silly that so many people look at and try to argue s historical and cultural significance without reading into Orwells nonfiction work but thats an argument for another time.,bookclub,d3tifxf,5,t5_2qktu

This is the first book Im reading for fun that Im actively annotating in as a read.

I didnt really grasp the idea that the US seceded a portion of the Northeast till the movie came along also cleared up the terms Experialism and Interdependence Day.Lyle weirds me out but his status with the kids is intriguing. Also Stices problem is humorouscreepy.The Clipperton tale originally led me to believe this was more of a farfetched legend until we have Mario as a first hand witness.  How could Mario possibly be so easy going with these major tragedies James and Clippertons suicide and major deformities? The only thing that seems to annoy him is the absence of Madam Psychosis.  I wonder what Mario would do if he knew she was just down the Hill at the Ennet House.The history of Interlace was a bit dull but did give me an interesting thought that DFW was somehow predicting the future.  This being his mention of fiber in peoples homes connected to modems streaming entertainment over the internet Netflix video telephone calls Skype and the mention that Sprint went bellyup heading there.

9616655,0,t3_5cc4f9,gt What is the significance of Ks meeting the other accused?One thing thats going on in the passage below is that upper class people are treated condescendingly and scornfully by the usher who by the way is the washwomans husband right?.  Anxiety about class and respectability is common in th c. urban writing and theres a lot of it in The Trial.The scene foreshadows what state K is likely to end up in despite his current cockiness.Where the usher talks in a reassuring voice explaining that K only asked a question  good example of show not tell narration its a psychologically salient illustration of how pathetic the accused has become.  The bit about him starting as if gripped by red hot tongs on the other hand seems more cliche less artful.I wonder  whats the significance of the sword being made of aluminum?gt They must all be very dispirited he said. Yes said the usher they are the accused everyone you see here has been accused. Really! said K. Theyre colleagues of mine then. And he turned to the nearest one a tall thin man with hair that was nearly grey. What is it you are waiting for here? asked K. politely but the man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly which was all the more pitiful to see because the man clearly had some experience of the world and elsewhere would certainly have been able to show his superiority and would not have easily given up the advantage he had acquired. Here though he did not know what answer to give to such a simple question and looked round at the others as if they were under some obligation to help him and as if noone could expect any answer from him without this help. Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and in order to calm him down and raise his spirits said The gentleman heres only asking what it is youre waiting for. You can give him an answer. The voice of the usher was probably familiar to him and had a better effect than K.s. Im  Im waiting  he began and then came to a halt. He had clearly chosen this beginning so that he could give a precise answer to the question but now he didnt know how to continue. Some of the others waiting had come closer and stood round the group the usher of the court said to them Get out the way keep the gangway free. They moved back slightly but not as far as where they had been sitting before. In the meantime the man whom K. had first approached had pulled himself together and even answered him with a smile. A month ago I made some applications for evidence to be heard in my case and Im waiting for it to be settled. You certainly seem to be going to a lot of effort said K. Yes said the man it is my affair after all. Not everyone thinks the same way as you do said K. Ive been indicted as well but I swear on my soul that Ive neither submitted evidence nor done anything else of the sort. Do you really think thats necessary? I dont really know exactly said the man once more totally unsure of himself he clearly thought K. was joking with him and therefore probably thought it best to repeat his earlier answer in order to avoid making any new mistakes. With K. looking at him impatiently he just said as far as Im concerned Ive applied to have this evidence heard. Perhaps you dont believe Ive been indicted? asked K. Oh please I certainly do said the man stepping slightly to one side but there was more anxiety in his answer than belief. You dont believe me then? asked K. and took hold of his arm unconsciously prompted by the mans humble demeanour and as if he wanted to force him to believe him. But he did not want to hurt the man and had only taken hold of him very lightly. Nonetheless the man cried out as if K. had grasped him not with two fingers but with red hot tongs. Shouting in this ridiculous way finally made K. tired of him if he didnt believe he was indicted then so much the better maybe he even thought K. was a judge. And before leaving he held him a lot harder shoved him back onto the bench and walked on. These defendants are so sensitive most of them said the usher of the court. Almost all of those who had been waiting had now assembled around the man who by now had stopped shouting and they seemed to be asking him lots of precise questions about the incident. K. was approached by a security guard identifiable mainly by his sword of which the scabbard seemed to be made of aluminium. This greatly surprised K. and he reached out for it with his hand. The guard had come because of the shouting and asked what had been happening. The usher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it himself saluted and hurried on walking with very short steps probably because of gout.,bookclub,d9yg874,1,t5_2qktu

Its really devilish the way Chichikov acted like a model citizen until he got what he wanted and then acted like a snake as soon as he was empowered.
