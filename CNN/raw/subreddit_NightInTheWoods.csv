10945696,0,t3_5w4o6i,I hung out with Bea as well. I loved all the characters but Bea stuck out to me as the one that I wanted to get to know the most. I think thats partly because there were a couple different areas where I really related to her and where she was coming from. Im going to start replaying it soon to see what Greggs story is like!,NightInTheWoods,de8yz2r,2,t5_2z77i
10962259,0,t1_deanxar,Personally I think a nuanced review is much more useful than a mere I liked it with few qualifications. And its a game that certainly provokes unusual reactions from people.,NightInTheWoods,deaoh6g,3,t5_2z77i

10991279,0,t1_deds1jr,Id absolutely agree with you that thats a probably a kickstarter character but that would be one of the  backers.The  tier reward gets you a cameo walkon character.The  backers get a character that is guaranteed to talk and might even be involved in a quest.,NightInTheWoods,dedtrqj,2,t5_2z77i

11117790,0,t1_der590o,A bunch of characters are based on KS backers. The  reward was for a background character based on you the  reward got you a character with dialog. According to the KS page they got  pledges for the nonspeaking roles and  pledges for speaking roles. Then there was one that got you a speaking role plus a song so at least  ingame characters are based on backers. They probably just used appearance and basic personality traits. I doubt they let backers write their own lines that couldve gone...poorly.Also all the initials you see carved into trees and walls and stuff are backers that was the  reward and they sold  of them.Honestly these rewards worked out really well. I didnt know about them until after I played and I never wouldve guessed.,NightInTheWoods,des6xq4,5,t5_2z77i

11156942,0,t1_dewg6gx,Scottgti mean mae specifically defines herself as well as shes going to at one point later in the game talking about how specific characteristics matter a lot to her but gender isnt a consideration. which i believe slots her firmly into the pan camp. camp pan. pantopia. officially pan. shed prob just say queer tho if asked because shed have a hard time making some formal specific classification and tbh i dunno how up on the terminology she is. like mae probably hasnt discovered the word pansexual yet. mae barely knows that whales arent fish or that you shouldnt microwave silverware. but she knows who she thinks is hot and she knows she wants to go watch wrestling with them and eat stadium nachos together.,NightInTheWoods,dewmlpp,16,t5_2z77i

11192780,0,t3_5zsob0,I found NITW through Late Night Work Club which is a group that puts out themed series of shorts by animators. Scott Benson is a member. His art style is all over the groups first video Ghost Stories The music through out the interstitials and especially in the intro sound very much like the music in NITW as well. Plus a cat with curious similarities to Mae can also be found through out. I know Ghost Stories is long  min but I recommend watching the whole thing because its fantastic. If you liked it Late Night Work Club also have a second group of shorts called StrangersIf you must Scott Bensons short on Ghost Stories begins at  BUT WATCH THE WHOLE THING ITS GREAT. Keep an eye out for Mae and pizza from Pastabilities!,NightInTheWoods,df0osmg,5,t5_2z77i
