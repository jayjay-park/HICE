3907672,0,t1_cr1nttp,So i tried a bot lane game with trinity gt bork gt LW and it worked very well. Just a few more questions what boots do you choose when and why? and what about the latest patch makes you say Ez belongs in mid lane in the current meta?,ezrealmains,cr1pjld,1,t5_384nj
6050344,0,t3_3xy5mo,Sheen  g manaprocA fine first item tbh. Tear  g manaregenAlso a good early item if you plan on building manamune.Dirk  g ad arpenIve officially been lost. Youre building  items at the same time? Pickaxe is almost g less for  more AD and it builds into manamune. That armor pen is worthless.Lucidity boots  g  cdr items at the same time my bad. I think these boots are pretty cost efficient but I really dont like them. You can get CDR from everywhere that isnt boots now and theres no reason to waste an item slot on an g item. Would you sit on Avarice the entire game?So you spend a grand total of g on mana  ad  arpen and  cdr. Between  minutes into the game youll have nothing but ad basically. Theres a reason people rush manamune if they buy it. Sheen into manamune is a much better powerspike. If you want to get ghostblade get it afterward. Manamune is best when rushed instead of sitting on tear. I havent played with ghostblade and triforce yet so I cant really talk about how strong thatd be. I can say though that the build seems subpar as it is. Item completion gt components. Powerspiking is super important and it looks like you only get  powerspike when you pick up dirk then nothing until triforce is finished. Thats pretty... slow. You basically do low damage in lane which is normal and then you offer very little until  minutes which is usually when games have been in the teamfight phase for  minutes or so. You want your huge powerspike to be around  minutes. ,ezrealmains,cycpbb9,1,t5_384nj

6876735,0,t1_d0uigek,Consider running Exhaust or Ignite against him personally I think its a favorable matchup especially since you can farm so safely with Q if needed.,ezrealmains,d0vsi4g,1,t5_384nj
6974845,0,t3_4b8f6n,I mainly use this on mobile so I dont really remember what the sub looks like lol but if you feel it looks that bad then offer to do something about it instead of just saying its bad. ,ezrealmains,d16xpqv,2,t5_384nj
7022251,0,t1_d1c65uc,lol yea I tried to resize the original trinity force icon but it didnt look right at that small a size so I just made a triforce lol,ezrealmains,d1cbnm2,1,t5_384nj
7538112,0,t3_4igtjg,I kind of prefer lich bane first and maxing Q over W. You play like Blue build poking a huge ton before any kind of initiation. REQW still does a ton of damage if you line it up right and Q basically doesnt have a CD. And one thing I do is run straight into lanejungle to reset R with Q after using it so I always have it up unless the match is so lopsided I cant even get out of base.Usually I build Lich gt Void gt Rabadon. If I ever reach Rabadon my Qs are hitting for  each hit. The poke is unreal. Mana doesnt seem to be an issue if you spam only Q. I only W if Im going all in or if its a sure hit. Endgame I sometimes go for Rylai for the permanent peel. Otherwise Luden MorelleSwain or any other high AP item is fine.The early game isnt too bad you cant really duel anyone without landing your full combo but you dish out so much poke nobody really wants to fight you. Note that Ive only played normals so far so this is a extremely limited perspective.,ezrealmains,d2z1oui,1,t5_384nj
7724635,0,t1_d3k5s33,I  agree with what you say about not going the same build every game I rarely do. I was just meaning it seems pretty good and I dont think a lot of people realise that,ezrealmains,d3k8jvt,1,t5_384nj
8223282,0,t3_4ry4h3,I got my last S for mastery  as ap ezreal mid so...,ezrealmains,d55gssd,1,t5_384nj
8462114,0,t3_4vhyr4,I hate when people say AP Ezreal cant be played bot lane. They say it because theyre imagining AP Ezreal the burstassassin midlaner not AP Ezreal the sustaineddamage hypercarry. AP Ezreal mid deals no sustained damage because he builds only Lich Bane as a CDRmana item and builds full burst after Deathcap Void Staff Ludens Echo etc. Obviously if you build that way you wont deal sustained damage because it isnt designed to deal sustained damage. So how does AP Ezreal build for sustained damage?Tear gt Lich Bane gt Nashors Tooth gt Deathcap gt Seraphs gt SituationalNashors tooth adds    AP to each Q and onhit to his autoattacks. Combined with the  attack speed he can actually clear waves and push towers exactly like an ADC would and the Lich Bane procs on towers means you actually outpush many ADCs once you have some AP. There is one other item that can come close to solving his waveclear problem Ludens Echo except its much slower and will not apply on his Q meaning his main pokedamage spell doesnt even benefit. Dont build this.DeathcapSeraphs together grant  AP minus the AP multiplication passive which is insane. After  items our AP will reach about  or so which means  Mystic Shot will dealgt   AP   base AD   AP     APgt   AP   base ADgt   base ADThis is literally equivalent to our DPS once we get  CDR and can Q every second. Thats from one spell and our other spells and sorta autoattacks all scale with AP. The build includes  CDR alone and we can cap that with blue buff Ionian shoes or AbyssalZhonyas.Hextech Gunblade is amazing on Ezreal because of the sustain of course but also the godly active and also the fact that it has no wasted stats he scales well with AP and AD. Taking it will eliminated the possibility of getting a defensive item or a Void Staff so weigh the benefit carefully. We dont want to get it early because while the sustain and active are nice CDR is more important to our damage in the longterm and Nashors waveclear is paramount to farming pushing and controlling waves throughout the game.Take AD reds for farming and strong Qs preLich Bane armor yellos and scaling MR blues like any ADC and Hybrid Pen quints. The penetration is useful early when all your damage is physical and remains strong in the lategame because while your Mystic Shot scales with AP  of your AP is converted into physical damage. Never take CDR blues because there are so many ingame ways to get  CDR including situational items and blue buff. For this same reason I advise Sorcerors Shoes over Lucidity Boots but whatever your preference.How strong is it? Almost exactly as strong as AD Ezreal early with the TearSheen start. Lich Bane is cheaper and higherdamage than Trinity Force but has less CDR so so far its about a draw. Then AD Ezreal pulls ahead once Muramana transforms and Nashors is a lull in power built primarilt for utility and CDR. After that every item AP Ezreal builds increases his power many times the amount of AD Ezreal and his lategame is absolutely monstrous. His comparatively weak early game is even covered completely if you can stack up Mejais which is simple when you cant get caught and can get assists globally with your ultimate. I start Dark Seal pots every game for this reason the snowball potential is some of the highest Ive seen on a bot lane carry especially considering how safe he is.Ive written a guide on this subject but I wont link it here as per site rules and how rough it looks Ive already revised it once and Im still drafting. If youre interested or have questions PM me and Ill get back to you soonish. As for how strong I think the build is it may by now be obvious that I think its absolutely busted and I play it every time I see my team has no source of magic damage which is surprisingly often but still not as often as Id like. The reason no one else plays this build is because it has its weaknesses Merc Scimitar Mortal Reminder Iceborn Gauntlet BORTK. These are just a few of the situational items AD Ezreal can build which helps to make him one of the most flexible of any ADC. With these items and high base damages he can remain relevant against nearly every enemy team no matter how far behind he may fall well within reasonable limits. AP Ezreal needs items and has no max health damage options with only  situational item slot or  if we begrudgingly discard Deathcap he cant afford defense AND magic pen AND whatever else. This usually works out because of the potential to snowball and his kits inherent safety but its worth keeping in mind and probably makes him less viable at high elo. While his sustained damage is amazing in a vaccuum hes worthless if he misses his skillshots. Blue Ezreal has his slow and Trinity Ezreal has autoattacks AP Ezreal has nothing so he can be even more difficult to play. Also unlike Jinx or Kogmaw he has no AOE meaning his duelling far outclasses his teamfight not even to mention that should a tank position in front of their carry you literally cannot hit them with Mystic Shot. Midgame is everything. Having a killer lategame is great if you can get there but in this meta the stronger earlymid game wins  of the time. Mind you AD Ezreals midgame is not THAT much stronger in particular if he cant efficiently stack his Tear. But it is stronger and the difference is felt.Go try this out in normals. If you can farm well preNashors or snowball with Mejais I recommend you take it to Ranked for easy stomping. If you cant I recommend you Get Gud kidd and then try it in Ranked once youve sufficently gotten.,ezrealmains,d5zatpq,4,t5_384nj

9556591,0,t1_d9qx69s,really it just comes down to burst dmg vs squishies and extra sustain which is gunblade vs consistent dmg vs tanksand attack speed which is botrk  and since most of the time I dont have to deal with super tanks I just go botrk and aim their adcsapcs,ezrealmains,d9r1ocj,2,t5_384nj
9560952,0,t3_5buqde,gross functionality and skill cap i guess.now that ap users can take towers just as quickly damage neutral objectives just as quickly and overall have an easier time getting through resistances...oh wait tank meta. ap ezreal gets fucked even harder by hp stacking and healshield comps. if you can avoid those things ap should be a lot better lmao,ezrealmains,d9rl0qa,6,t5_384nj

11186592,0,t3_5zjoec,This sounds really interesting and fun. Not that I am a support player. But would consider this when I get autofilled to support in normal games. I have some questions though. In lane the target is to poke down the enemy and make them recall or poke until an all in? Are there any matchups you want to avoid as a support? Which stages of the game is the strongest for Ezreal support? The start item get upgraded into the sightstone thing or sold?,ezrealmains,dezzjo7,1,t5_384nj
