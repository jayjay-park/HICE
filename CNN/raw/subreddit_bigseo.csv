For instance you could have one for every major newspaper on the country...or one for the Tech beat only etc. etc.Searching twitter bios is also a great way to find journalist or use a service like Muckrack.

I hadnt thought about the fact that theyre competing.Just to clarify the .info site doesnt list products other than links such as a featured product element on some pages which links through to .com so no real duplication there. I think the confusion comes in because they share the same nameTLD and have some links from one to the other in the main navigation for example the ecommerce site links to articles and forums on the info site.

372954,0,t3_1yd3yl,SEO is only a small part of the equation. What you need to do is think of a complete holisticbuzzwords yay marketing strategy to generate traffic. You want to build a brand however big or small around your mom. . Create an account on Etsy. . Promote it through pinterest and facebook. . Once you have enough sales to justify creating a standalone website create one. . Continue promoting the facebook and pinterest as they are your current growth drivers. . Start promoting the website in tandem with etsy until you reach parity. . Start running promotions and sales from your website and devote most of your attention there. . Reach out to fashion bloggers and tech geek blogs to crosspromote your content and merchandise. Ask for feedback.Do all of this in this order. You can add steps in between but dont put the cart before the horse. No need to build a site that gets no traffic. Why not test your market viability through an established marketplace like Etsy?SEO isnt a means to an end. It is a mechanism that aids in the way search engines relate to your content. Again what you need is to think allaround marketing and where it arises leverage SEO to make things easily indexable in competitive spaces.

1474311,0,t3_2b1t1p,I sort of believe this is somewhat true since brand search is the sort of social signal Google would actually trust since they know a lot about who is searching. However I expect its something that could be abused. Other SEOs have referred to concepts such as the boomerang principle  whereby people returning to the SERPs after visiting your site could be factored into its rankings for the search terms in question. If someone returns to the SERPs then maybe the page on your site doesnt fit user intent. Theyve said that sites can lose ranking for this reason. Reverse this concept.Some SEOs have referred to a benefit of blogging and ranking for longtail keywords builds Googles trust in your site so youre helped to rank for more competitive terms. I dont know if this is true. But it stands to reason that if it is true brand visits demonstrate that your site is more trustworthy. The question is... just for that keyword or in general? ,bigseo,cj12vnh,1,t5_2wjav

1914976,0,t1_ckjxhb8,Heres a list of stuff.Theres still a lot of value when working with very large sites to working on crawl efficiency and optimization. Since Caffeine launched Google just roars through sites without caring exactly what theyre crawling. So its up to the site to ensure theyre not crawling a bunch of garbage or parameter versions of URLs etc.Matching query syntax with your title tag is also pretty important in my book. People like to see exactly the words they searched for when they assess a SERP. And if people do this you better believe Google optimizes for it too. Diversification of channels. Dont get too fat and happy on organic Google traffic. Its great to acquire users through this channel but if youre not finding ways to convert them and getting them back through other channels then youre cruising for a bruising. Text on the page still matters ... a lot. A few times this year Ive been acutely reminded of this truism. Just make sure its highly focused.Schema markup and Knowledge Graph Optimization. Im a believer and use it generously on all of the client sites I work with  to the extent I can convince them.Readability and social sharing optimization. Make it easy for people to digest and share your content. Far too many still dont focus on this part of the equation. Good things happen when more people see your content and brand.Memorable content. It doesnt necessarily have to be great or valuable or emotional but it does have to be memorable. So having a consistent content strategy aimed at hacking attention and memory is extremely effective. This also means spending as much time promoting the content as it does creating it. ,bigseo,ckjxx1y,2,t5_2wjav

2060654,0,t3_2iffmq,In answer to your question I think Google might prefer  seen as how that is how the website is indexed in Google itself but I dont think it really matters tbh.The real issue here is that youve essentially went under a site change in Googles eyes. What Ive noticed from experience is that rich snippets tend to show more for trusted sites and all of the trust signals may not have completely carried over from http to  in your case yet. I would say that if its all coded correctly and previewing fine in Googles rich snippet tool time is what you need here.It might be that time established in itself is a trust factor and Google will start dropping in your rich snippets again as the  version of your site becomes more established with links to that version directly.But as before if its all coded correctly I think giving it a bit of breathing space and seeing what happens is the best course of action.,bigseo,cl1r5j0,4,t5_2wjav

Are any of the nonindexed pages being linked by external sites and are they the page or external sites being filled with crap links?Can you be stupidly specific about footer link? e.g. a sitewide navigation bar with links to our contact us page site map privacy policy etc.  Are all footer links on category pages the same or do they vary depending on what page theyre on? If it varies is the dynamic nature of the footer link deployed by Javascript? ,bigseo,cofyehl,3,t5_2wjav

After how every many days he has to make payment in his country e.g.  days in the UK tell him youre going to sell the debt to local debt collectors and this is his last chance to pay today before that happens. Then sell to local debt collectors. Hell you could even be totally honest tell him how much money youre going to lose by doing so and go from there..

Also maybe a way to just show code entries since I dont really know what to do with all the code entries?Small thing but Please wait while we load the files history... doesnt disappear after the history is loaded.If Im being really finicky I wish there was a little more vertical space in between some of the elements on the page it all seems rather squished towards the top. But thats like a major nitpick moment here obviously.You know its a great service when thats the best I can come up with to criticize. For real I really like this.I also like how it notices when I dont type in a robots.txt URL but still runs the history anyway. I feel like there are deeper applications for this. I can use this for sitemap.xml comparisons too or even easier ways to look at any pages history  the size column gives me a good idea of how substantial the changes are. I bet theres a way to make a version of this into like a redesign detector or something too. I think youve got a LOT of potential applications with this.I also wish there was a funny picture of an old robot geezer but yknow no site can be perfect eh I might write a blog post about potential uses of this site after thinking about it a little more if I do Ill let you know.

8509961,0,t1_d6558r4,For me a huge element has been providing content that the subreddit as a whole is likely to enjoy with a title that is immediately appealing. Its important to note that I only do this in subreddits where I have genuinely been engaged and I think the article will be wellreceived and appreciated and even then Ive had about  results.A good example is rTrueDetective. I posted an article that was very appealing to a typical True Detective fan  just a list of things you might like while you wait for the next season. It was well received. Later I posted a more nuanced arguably negative article about True Detective that wasnt downvoted into oblivion but was mostly received with shrugs and no response at all. I think that one element you always had to take into account is that people will upvote something without having read it if they like the headline often planning to return to it in the future. So to provide a straightforward headline that many users will appreciate is vital. That and you have to actively participate in the subreddit. You have to genuinely be a fellow user of the subreddit in order to see the results you want. You cant game reddit and you should never even really try. ,bigseo,d65au7l,2,t5_2wjav

8919562,0,t1_d7jzozq,Awesome!  Step  is to make sure that all your vendors and business partners links to you.  Thats a big one and takes a lot of time to get right. If your coffee vendors dont list their distributors on their website make one really cool story about your story and try to get them to take it as a guest blog.  You can reuse the same basic story in a lot of different places. Step  would be to spend the money to send your coffee to prominent food bloggers in your area.  Ask them to rate the coffee.  Maybe even have it delivered to them hot via Postmates or UberEats.  That eats up your budget fast but will get you a lot of good will. If you cant find prominent food bloggers in your area I would even do this with the most popular YELPERS in your area in exchange for YELP reviews. Step   Check Meetup.Com for meetup groups in your area with a website.  See if you can get them all a first cup of coffee for free if they do their next meetup at your shop.  Ask them to link from their website in exchange.  This will probably exceed your budget unless you are able to get the coffee owner to agree that giving free coffee isnt really spending money. ,bigseo,d7k01ke,7,t5_2wjav

A better use of DA though is to look at your DA now compared to your DA in past relative to your competitors DA compared to their DA in past. Using it to determine trend differentials is valuable.

10597673,0,t3_5rntyp,A technique I like to use is what I call the Money on the Table when selling the value of SEO. Its basically just a competitor comparison but on non branded terms. Ill pick like  high search volume terms that I know that the stakeholder values for their business something with a specific user intent that may bring in money. Their competitors hold page  ranking and they are on . From there its simple math. This term X is a nonbranded term that received  searches a month. Since this is nonbranded it means that the user is potentially shopping around without a specific brand in mind. We dont rank for this term at all! Those visitors researching online will never hear about us. Competitor A though hes ranked . that means of those  searches a month hes could be capturing around  potential customers just for this term! Then you can do an average sale value versus site average conversion and give a roughly estimated missed opportunity dollars. I read on a blog that a move from position  to position  increased sales revenue by . Find evidence like that and just nail it to their foreheads during your presentation.Its a sales pitch for SEO. You get them fired up keep stoking the fire over the next few weeks be super proactive in your suggestions. I saw you posted this blog i recommend doing A B C and I can do D and E for you to optimize for SEO type things. ,bigseo,dd92h4o,3,t5_2wjav

You Rand and Matt Cutts were the only ones to respond to our tweets so thank you. My question is this when do you feel done?We trialled the paid version of wordstream for a year and always found it more frustrating than it was worth. Other agencies we collaborate with swear by it but we felt it was lacking some key features at the time... Enough to make it difficult to incorporate into any ongoing processes at least. With a product like that it must be really difficult to say thats it were done and step away... How do you do it? When do you know when to stop listening to feature requests from idiots like me and ship? In the year we subscribed WS went through several iterations! All of them better than the last.
