5540834,0,t3_3ojs5y,You CAN die from Chiari but you probably wont. It is very important that you get that MRI though so that if it is Chiari you can get treatment before you start progressing more.  The way it works is once you have a new symptom show up its more likely than not that it will be permanent. The surgery works to slow progression of central nervous system damage but they cant guarantee that your symptoms will go away. If youre lucky some might and some might lessen in severity. Also the outcome of surgery is inversely proportional to how long youve had symptoms so the longer youve had symptoms the less better you are after surgery. BUT even if you experience no change the surgery will keep you from getting worse. This is not to scare you but it is complete misinformation that Chiari cant kill you. This month alone  people in my support group have died from Chiari complications. Some after surgery some just out of nowhere. I want to reiterate that YOU arent going to die but I dont think that lying about what is possible is helpful to anyone. ,chiari,cwjw1ye,2,t5_2tiwy

The fact that the syrinx is building back up is concerning because it means the drain isnt functioning properly.Im in Raleigh NC. ,chiari,d34fhr1,1,t5_2tiwy
