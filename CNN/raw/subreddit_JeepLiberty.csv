I had    OEM tires and upgraded to    Cooper Discoverer RTX all terrain tires Here are some pictures  I daily drive mine on the highway and they have a very quiet nice ride. I also go offroad and they have only impressed me. I cant wait to get into some snow with them. Paid like  a tire. Aww yeah,JeepLiberty,cx1scsb,1,t5_2v8kd
