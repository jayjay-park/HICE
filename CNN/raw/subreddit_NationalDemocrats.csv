8478635,0,t1_d61daxr,Archers can easily clear barb camps and are the best at doing so. This is because once you bombard a camp the unit inside will just sit and fortify till you kill it. If you use melee units they take damage and after you take the camp you need to sit and heal up. With Archers you can clear the camp and then carry on to the next one.,NationalDemocrats,d61deif,2,t5_3fp2n
