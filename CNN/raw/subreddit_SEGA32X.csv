7548153,0,t3_4ioxp4,I think the X was good in concept poor in execution. If anything the NDS has proven that you can split the user base without it being a total disaster and the PS. looks to be the same. Maybe if Sega had supported the X a bit longer wed be hearing a different story. One thing I wish they had done with the X was to have it enhance Genesis games in some meaningful way. Maybe if they had taken their time and seeded X modes into Genesis carts it would have been a success. Other than Castlevania the one game Im really sad that never made it was the supposed arcade port of AvP. ,SEGA32X,d306ssk,2,t5_2w47f
