5396997,0,t1_cw1iscm,I just watched highlights from the WingsLightning game and to someone used to watching the Wild it did feel really slow. Its probably just that difference in playing style. The Wild dive to stop rushes and swipe the puck to get the puck into the opponents defensive zone and keep it there. Then when theyre there they frenzy pass and skate hard to basically keep everything frantic which is how they score a lot of the time. The Wings seemingly play veeery differently  ,thebuffalowildwings,cw1iycv,3,t5_3ab5a

5843559,0,t1_cxl9k0f,I might argue LeMaire as coach. He has more cups but they were mostly as a player. He did get a lowtalent team to the WCF in . The only concern I would have is that his coaching style is boring.,thebuffalowildwings,cxlm81e,1,t5_3ab5a
7583149,0,t3_4j6wco,I saw your other post and thought it was a great idea! I would be interested if we get the cost low enough. ,thebuffalowildwings,d3460x1,1,t5_3ab5a
7584740,0,t1_d341etk,I took a screenshot of the jersey and sent it to my buddy who deals with a lot of team orders. I asked him if its something they could do. I know he once did an order for a team called the Kings and he was able to use the LA logo with subtle changes. Its definitely not the official LA logo but at first glance it looks very very similar. Im still waiting to see what he has to say but I bet hed be able to do it.,thebuffalowildwings,d34cjau,1,t5_3ab5a
