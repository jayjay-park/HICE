2386896,0,t1_cm6q0l6,I agree with you on many points here. I really thought it was great how there was a Meta in Dark Souls. It had a community sense and encouraged creative builds that required tradeoffs. Anyone whos ever cheated or endlessly grinded at a game to completely overpower their character knows its just not fun if you can always do anything and everything and be the absolute hardest hitting fastest ubermensch. The excitement for Dark Souls PVP really came from the variety and trade offs. Now it seems everyone just grinds to the highest level they can to stay competitive.I dont know what the answer is either. I think anything that encourages different builds and making certain combinations viable with skill should be encouraged. It also allows for huge replayability because you DONT get to try everything the first playthrough. I trust Miyazaki in terms of coming up with a great story. I hope that during the development of this game what didnt work in Dark Souls  is noticed and not included.,bloodbornethegame,cm6q8cp,6,t5_33z5b

2682028,0,t3_2qqwfz,Does a bear shit in the woods?             Bluntness aside. There were weaponarmor drops in the leaked Alpha area but I believe this was from a boss either way though. I would be shocked if there wasnt weapon or armor drops. Or anything like that. This is sort of a staple of these style of games that Miyazaki makes and From in general.                 Kings Field Shadow Tower they had unique drops and things like that.                  But I do agree that the weapons being transformable kind of makes me nervous of variety and so one. But there are gadgets and other things added in so we will see.                 But i could imagine some sweet unique weapons from bosses and other enemies that are the named or unique items weve seen in the past.             Moonlight Greatsword has been in From games for over  years. I would really hope it somehow comes back not to mention the moonlight theme fits all too perfectly in the themes weve seen out of Bloodborne.                 But I feel that with the transforming weapons I worry that they will be fewer and farther between to pick them up. With things like gadgets and the like being the more common pick ups and switches. The game might be more forced into builds like other games in the series but you sort of build around the weapon you choose.             but we dont know stats or anything. Theyve mentioned other weapons and that there is a good variety that we havent seen and that they didnt want to talk about.                      But for simple weapons I dont know. I feel like we havent heard anything about them and I could have sworn they confirmed that all weapons transform? Or main weapons. Maybe there will be more offhand weapons that dont have to exclusively be guns. But we have seen an image of what looks like a straight up gatling gun which would probably have to be a mainhand weapon so I dunno.                I couldnt state enough how I want there to be a claymore some how. Simple or transformable.                  As for my does a bear shit in the woods?. I really dont actually think its that for sure and its one of my bigger concerns with the game. But Ive had it before with Dark Souls  and  about variety and both times my worries were completely misplaced. Especially Dark Souls . The variety of armors and weapons in that game is fantastic.  ,bloodbornethegame,cn8ntmp,6,t5_33z5b

I just feel like when Dark Souls  launched I didnt hear much about it when the game launched. And with this game I hear about it from a lot of places that I didnt hear about Dark Souls  from. What I mean is my friends werent too interested in Dark Souls  but theyre interested in Bloodborne and while I didnt see any TV ads of Dark Souls  I feel like any kind of Playstation advertisement features Bloodborne.

3169377,0,t3_2w9wkp,I am incredibly glad. Backstabs were the worst part of the Souls series in terms of PvP. This was mainly because latency caused them to be unpredictable and the enemy would always seemingly teleport behind you already in a backstab animation.

3175298,0,t1_cor3ivs,Her cloak has a lacey trim and a hood so theres really not much of a similarity and the skin looking like a cloak is no reason to assume they are the same. Just because she says thirst doesnt mean that shes going to turn into the Thirsty Beast. She begins to transform yes but it cuts to a montage of all the known large beasts which relates to her comment on the frailty of men. And those are not boobs those are ribs. Its emancipated.,bloodbornethegame,cor4a4p,2,t5_33z5b

3194263,0,t1_cosy0kt,This is my chilled out. This is very close to how I speak irl amongst family and friends and the like. Im nicer about it sure. I come here and other forums so I dont have to filter as much as I do already. I have fun arguing about things. I love being right. Like a lot. Okay fine its patronizing but that doesnt change how I feel. Hell I had a conversation with SwinnyUK about a week ago and he didnt know shit about the game. Look I appreciate that you were honest with me without flinging insults. And I admit Ive gotten worse lately. But Im not going to change myself. I dont think that I could even if I wanted to.That being said I think Im going to go into lurk mode for a while. I always knew I was going to say something one day that would incite the scorn of the community and it seems like this is the last straw for many people. So I guess Ill just disappear for a bit. Who knows maybe people will start to miss me.,bloodbornethegame,cot32zg,0,t5_33z5b

3243803,0,t3_2x9tbj,Back in December I made a thread asking for advice on how to convince my friend to get bloodborne and Im still not sure if he is going to get it still  havent been pushing it really so I think Im going to buy him a preorder for it for his birthday thats the th of March so I can play it with someone to clarify me and my friends never buy gifts for each others birthdays maybe a shot or two at the bar but thats about it. so for me to buy something for him is out of the norm for our friends. And yes Im going to force feed this game to him if thats what it takes. Like you said the first playthrough is important and I dont think  is anything compared to it. ,bloodbornethegame,coy87sk,2,t5_33z5b
