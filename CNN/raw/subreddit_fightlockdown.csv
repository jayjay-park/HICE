3088208,0,t1_coi28ig,All good points. I also wouldnt be surprised at all to see Hendricks get caught  especially as hes no longer champ. Assuming GSP actually isnt using Ive seen theories that hethe UFC found out Hendricks was and thats why there were all of those issues leading up to the fight GSP demandingpaying for WADA testing and then GSPs retirement and campaign for stronger testing.,fightlockdown,coi3a5d,2,t5_2z3j4
3088789,0,t3_2vd802,Ever since the UFC instated that policy that theyll cover medical and training costs in the event of an injury during a training camp dudes have been dropping fights. And yes Chuck Liddell was one badass mfer,fightlockdown,coi5gf0,1,t5_2z3j4

4546644,0,t3_3daydm,Im gonna go with Mir. He has a knack of pulling wins out of his ass. However  he cannot take a punch if his life depended on it  and the only time Ive seen Duffee punch is when he got that s KO  years ago,fightlockdown,ct3qais,1,t5_2z3j4
7864232,0,t1_d3zccym,that was not unexpected but quicker than expected. I dont know how many times i have seen fightersreportersphysical objects etc banned for life from the ufc for a short amount of time. Gotta love uncle Danas temper tantrums. ,fightlockdown,d400ffd,1,t5_2z3j4
