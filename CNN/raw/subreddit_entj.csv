2734073,0,t3_2r0wsd,I am nearly incapable of telling a lie. But there are ways of manipulating the truth in a way that appeals to others. Some people can handle it and others cant. However one of the things that has stuck with me as a matter of fact ever since th grade was that people always found me trustworthy.It is interesting to say the least. I am the one my friends come to for counseling if they ever have problems even despite my lacking regard for emotions. At the same time my friends were often hesitant to go off to some activities like playing boardvideogames with me because of how serious I always presented myself to be. I have even asked a few friends and none of them really see my sense of humor even when I joke I tend have a way of rooting it to reality.I cannot quite find the balance though. There are times where people are just not interested in the truth and I just dont understand it.

2949570,0,t3_2tx3vd,I was in a relationship with an ENTJ female fairly recently. I think I can lend some insight here. We didnt date long but I think the combo has a ton of potential. The potential really excited me the prospect of being with someone you can almost telepathically communicate with. I theorize it would make a lot more time for I dunno world domination.   We got very close very fast because we operated in largely the same way and were on the same wavelength in almost every way.Our age differene was considerable. I had just turned  and she had just turned . She broke up with me because she idealized a three year relationship she had with a guy in high school and being with me just didnt give her the same feeling. I broke up with girls at her age for similar reasons so I cant really blame her even if I think her reasoning is stupid.Anyway she wanted to continue being best friends because of the connection we had often interacting with me in intimate ways normally reserved for a significant other. In my opinion  and I admit I can be very wrong here  she was on the cusp of loving me but thought she wanted to be best friends. This was really the only conflict we had and it wasnt a conflict in the strictest sense. I just created distance because her feelings were mixed up and to protect myself.So just like any pairing timing values and life experience need to align. Id certainly entertain the idea of dating another but Im more interested in finding an intuitive  not necessarily another NTJ  at least if I have a choice in the matter. Communicating with sensors especially Si types tend to be excruciating to me.As for ENTJ men going for SF women absolutely a trend. At least for me.

4412875,0,t3_3bgxx0,I think having Se in the tertiary position with a more dominant Ni gives me a weird relationship with the physical world. I feel torn between highly valuing purely intellectual pursuits and wanting to experience the pleasures of life. I think the Se keeps me grounded in reality where otherwise I might go full INTJ and hyperfocus on ideas.When I was younger and my Se less developed I would occasionally go through bouts of extreme indulgence or selfdenial. I was pretty overweight as a kid from overeating for pleasure. As I got older I did some extreme regimens of dieting or working out and they mostly coincided with times that were emotionally difficult and I felt out of control of my life. I see this as a time when my Ni was overwhelmed so I fell into a TeSe loop of trying to hypercontrol my environment.I think Se is also an important social tool for ENTJs. This page says it better than I could so Ill quote gt...ENTJs may even consciously notice the effectiveness of Se as a social strategy... and understand through TeNi that it can be reverse engineered and applied in a more structured and purposeful environment as well... When positively applied tertiary Se connects the ENTJ to a real physical awareness of the impressions and immediate sensations her words and actions create on the people around her. Rather than seeing the world simply as a set of causal relationships that combine and interact to form plans and complete objectives Se prompts her to recognize the more direct relationships between her own stylistic approach and the expectations and desires of the people she seeks to influence and direct.What this means to me is that Se is what allows ENTJs to be somewhat manipulative or as I prefer to describe it charming. While I think most people slightly alter their behavior to match what will make others like them ENTJs do this a bit more consciously than others. Were just good at turning on our charm. Sometimes I find myself in the middle of a big group of people and theyre all laughing and smiling at some story Im telling and Im a little shocked that its happening. Is that really me? I see myself as blunt and demanding yet somehow I have a natural ability to make people like me. And I absolutely use this ability to my advantage which is why I said manipulative earlier. However theres a negative connotation to manipulation as if Im trying to make people do something bad so maybe influential is a better word? ,entj,csn2djg,3,t5_2r36o

Unrelated but I also think policies are failing the poor young and small businesses. In many places like Los Angeles for example you have to wait an average of  months for approval license in a city to start a restaurant while people remain unemployed. You can couple that with tax compliance such as the Medicare Medicaid and Social Security taxes that businesses and employees both have to pay which is more paperwork and expenses discouraging hiring in general. I dont have a link but I remember a poll from TheSelfEmployed.com where most people said those employment taxes are harder to file than the income tax so it makes me wonder why we cant just raise all revenues from one tax..like the income tax.,entj,cubw5g3,2,t5_2r36o
4999160,0,t1_cun45oy,So glad you posted that this question was raised and that you chose to answer. Its a good chance to point out something too often overlooked with MyersBriggs and most psych profile tools but which stands out in the leadership types the differences between male and female respondents is in how leadership skills are socialized between the sexes.For most people in the western world risktaking and other aggressive behavior associated with male leadership is rewarded and praised from an early age while female leadership qualities are often labelled bossypushybtchy and discouraged. While many women move beyond those inhibitors it takes great effort and often comes later in life after intentional cultivation of managerial skills which are compatible with the ENTJ takecharge instinct.Male leaders and female leaders are often held accountable for missteps in different frequently unequal ways. Consequences tend to be more severe for female leaders if they work in maledominated fields or when public opinion has an influence on their position. A lot of research points to this being one key factor in the lack of female candidates for public office. If examining where your BriggsMyers result and your sexbased socialization overlap is something that interests you academic research on leadership cultivation among women is REALLY abundant online. Id suggest a casual review to see if any of it rings true based on your experiences. ,entj,cuol3l0,2,t5_2r36o

8058033,0,t3_4p100l,Im an INFJ woman who have INTJ and ENTJ friends as well as some dating experiences with both just dating not relationships.From an INFJ womans point of view INTJ men are very easy to get along with because they are great conversationists and listeners. They are also pretty persistent in trying to pursue a woman and does so in a very classy manner bringing flowers and showing kind gestures. Theres a part of me however that thinks that the INTJs inner world is really rich and wild but its just for the INTJ to enjoy not for anybody else. They keep to themselves a lot which makes communication a bit slow and sometimes frustrating. However their sincerity always makes up for it. I admire ENTJs because theyre actually both creative and very forceful. They speak with a lot of strength in their voice for a lack of a better word which pretty much sums up how right or correct they feel about a situationsubject. Im not sure if they know they sound argumentative even on first dates. They are very curious people so they as very direct questions no shame. I dont mind this because I ask all the same questions back but it does exhaust me a bit. All ENTJs Ive met have also been a little secretive about something. Its not the same type of rich inner world as INTJs but its more of a grand master plan type of a hidden world that I dont really see well through. Theyve all been athletic as well. Theyre right in their thinking for the most part so I respect them for that.,entj,d4lss13,3,t5_2r36o

Theres no ideal type compatibility some types are theoretically expected to fly better than others others not so in theory considering similar and dissimilar cognitive functions their order and stacking still we should give the other person the chance to prove what really is in reality and in doing so not letting type classifications define who we choose to have a relationship with despite it explaining how our brains are wired it does not take into account every other nuance present that makes a person person. So I say to fucking hell with the INFPENTJ pairing and any other pairing actually we get it the first time.I therefore promote the use of MBTI as a tool to understand and love your SO better not as a means to stereotype a whole group and exclude the great possibilities that every other type can offer if given the chance.Edit Im sorry if I come off aggressive.,entj,d5go76v,1,t5_2r36o

Some of them make me cringe if I watch them now.I dont really consider type when assessing the validity of a given viewpoint idea or even philosopher. That seems silly to me. A good idea is a good idea and a bad idea is a bad idea regardless of the MBTI type of the person selling it. And someone who is boldly wrong is usually just annoying.Regarding white guilt I definitely dont think people should live their lives feeling guilty for being white and I do think it is problematic to talk about white privilege since I think this reframes the discussion to be about demonizing the fact that white people are not abused rather than about how minorities sometimes are abused. That being said its really easy to go full throttle onto the other side where you deny the existence or influence of racism as such.

9388419,0,t3_5934hu,The short answer I think the main weakness Ive experienced is expecting the world to line up Just So and having to constantly remind myself that it really really really doesnt.  I think Te has more benefits than flaws but it does really suck when the Fi hits although I generally find a way to Te my way through it as well.Longer answer Its when Im interacting with other people from the Fi side like my mother or my college roommate to name a few that I really see the limitations of my Te.  Im constantly reminded that a lot of the world acts based on what they feel like doing rather than what I would consider to be logical.  This can lead to headbutting and hurt feelings.  And contrary to the ENTJ stereotypes I actually do care about people and how they feel but I have trouble accommodating this because I have a crapton of trouble even beginning to comprehend why you would want work from a Fidominant point of view.  On the other hand I do know that I have trouble doing this so in the end I just have to accept it that it exists and start using my Te to work within this framework which infuriates my Te to no end but my Te also recognizes that sometimes you just have to accept things and move on.And then because I am constantly assessing a situation and judging by logic people dont realize how much I do actually feel things.  Still waters run deep as the saying goes so when the Fi rears its head buckle up.  So yes sometimes I do just feel stuff and theres no logical reason for feeling it which is confusing and frustrating to me.  My first instinct is to bottle it up but then fortunately my Te sense usually usually not always comes through and I force myself to actually work through what Im feeling.  However this process comes off as incredibly robotic to my Fe friends which in turn reinforces ENTJ stereotypes repeat cycle.In the end however Im happy with where my Te has gotten me in life and my INFJ friend often comes to me when shes worked herself into a knot of feelings and needs someone to sort things out.,entj,d961r79,3,t5_2r36o

Thats how my state of mind goes.You can achieve in  minutes of impersonal confrontation what would take an hour of pussyfooting around peoples comfort zones. The key thing is acknowledging that youre making things difficult and expressing that youre not angry or otherwise trying to actively create problems that instead youre doing it because its for the best and people tend to be more willing to go along with you as long as you have past results to back up your claims that its worth it.

Also an interesting choice of words  substitute just about any sort of racial physical gender sexuality or religious type and it looks like a whole different kind of post  ignorant. Some of your posts seem well thought out others seem young and ignorant.  Its an interesting mix almost like there are multiple people playing with the username.  ,entj,dfbpcv2,5,t5_2r36o

11353628,0,t1_dfidis5,gt Personally I think ENTJs are the least spiritual type of people. As Ive witnessed ENTJs just watch movies for entertainment and talk way too much.Quoting because I suspect that youll be editing or deleting this in short order.You are denigrating our type on our subreddit. You are bringing up spirituality in a discussion that is about philosophy and theoretical ideas. You are saying that we as a group just watch movies for entertainment  which I infer to mean that you are characterizing us as shallow. You say that we talk way too much.In other words you are being provocative derailing to a different topic and making value judgments about our entire type based on people you know.This is pathetic. Go spit your shit somewhere else.,entj,dfiwv7p,2,t5_2r36o

11483064,0,t3_63v5kv,You need to improve your popularity while undermining his. Fe can seem fake and it suppresses Ti so you can manipulate that. First ingratiate yourself to other people by asking for their input on various projects citing their strength in a particular area. Then do all of the work yourself to a higher standard than what they could but publicly give them heaps of credit and thank them for their input. Buy them coffee banter pretend youve been going through something difficult that has finally resolved hence the personality change. Itll also act as an emotional hook. Second ingratiate yourself to him. Hes going to be suspicious of your motivations so you need to address that doubt early on  say that since it looks like youre going to be his VP youre gonna help him however you can. Tell him you two can be a great team with his people skills and your knack for administration youre going to make real progress together. Befriend him find his weaknesses get him to rely on you. Help him support him tell him you can see hes not handling the stress very well. Become the crutch that you will later pull out from under him. Once youve built rapport with other people chip away at their confidence in him. Compliment sandwiches are the best way to do this subtly I was going to ask opponents name here because hes really good at this stuff but he seems really stressed at the moment. Hes a smart guy though Im sure hell get a handle on it. Rinse and repeat with every workmate until it is wellestablished that he doesnt handle stress well. Simultaneously look like youre overcompensating for his weaknesses and defend him from criticism further entrenching his critics in their views. Extra points if you can make them believe that he doesnt like them and is just pretending it will ruin all of their further interactions. Fuck shit up a little. Quietly make him out to be an obstacle to getting things done yknow because he can be a bit volatile sometimes. Make sure things dont get done that were his responsibility. Mislead him as to the urgency or importance of tasks act like its no big deal when it is. Stress the importance of trivial matters make sure he allocates way too much time to them. Keep defending him to others keep pretending to help him. Empathize with his frustration when things dont go well and give him empty reassurances that itll be fine.  If he gets the position dont sweat it. Be cool calm and confident and keep undermining until he quits or is fired. Instant promotion. Also fine if he holds the title but you are the power behind he throne as long as in action you are the superior.,entj,dfxlq7e,8,t5_2r36o

11642202,0,t1_dgflx56,I come from a family of very strong women. Many pale in comparison. Also part of being an ENTJ is respecting people who will stand up to you. Lack of depth lack of a fire inside of them to me looks a lot like a low intensity person.,entj,dgfno44,6,t5_2r36o
