This reduces some of the Maillard reactions that darken beer and caramelization.  Google late extract addition for a wealth of information about this technique.A lot of people just add it all at the beginning and thats OK too.  Some recipes specify when to add your extract and in those cases I follow the instructions since hop utilization can be affected.I dont know that either way is necessarily better.  A little bit of reading will give you a better understanding of the usually subtle differences and why you might want to do one over the other.You almost never add extract after the boil.

Avoid splashing the beer in the bucket at transfer and if you have c purge the bucket before transfer and purge the head space before you put the lid back on.

Which Im perfectly happy with just not what I was expecting.So if you do try bottling with honey maybe give it longer than you would for normal bottling sugar.,Homebrewing,cesvag8,2,t5_2qj8u

128232,0,t3_1vjb7d,I recently transferred my first lager into the secondary and it had a very strong sulfur smell and taste to it. I used  american lager yeast  minute boil and primary fermented at  degrees for two weeks. Im very cautious with sanitation so I dont think its infected. Its currently sitting in the secondary in my cellar at  degrees Michigan. Will the sulfur smelltaste go away? How long should I let it sit in the secondary? What can I do to prevent this in the future? Has anyone else experienced this with this particular yeast? I know sulfur smells are common in lagers but but this was pretty strong and undrinkable if it stays that strong. Any input would be great. Thanks. ,Homebrewing,cet18h0,1,t5_2qj8u

A lot of rHomebrewing consists of conventional processes thatll no doubt complicate your brew day but if your process works for you I recommend sticking with it!  How much grains are you using?  I imagine that you loose some liquid after mashing the grains.  Do you add additional water?  Also you mention temp control which I highly recommend.  Unless youre looking for more of a ester forward somewhat like a hefeweizen  beer always shoot for that  ambient temp.  At that temp I dont think a secondary is necessary as long as you give it enough time.   Let it sit  weeks total before bottling and I imagine youd be fine.  If youre concerned about bottle bombs buy a hydrometer and take some measurements to determine if the yeast is still working through the sugars.  ,Homebrewing,cexu43p,1,t5_2qj8u

They were ground in a coffee mill which certainly increased the extraction. You can always make a tea with more spices to add later if the initial flavor is too low.

304697,0,t1_cfca5te,Well I know what happens when you add sugar to a fermenting beverage and I know what marshmallows are made of. So I dont really have to try it to find out. The list of ingredients for your average marshmallows will read something like sugar sugar modified corn starch sugar water gelatin tetrasodium pyrophosphate a thickener or emulsifier and artificial flavor where sugar is replaced with the actual type of sugar... corn syrup dextrose etc. Needless to say if you put these in your carboy the yeast will have a field day with them and eat them all up. But to get the flavor youre really going to have to look elsewhere since theres so little in a marshmallow that it really makes adding them an exercise in futility. Perhaps if you could find a way to caramelize lactose? Since most beer yeasts wont gobble up lactose you could caramelize it and add that as an adjunct after your primary fermentation is done? That and a bit of vanilla and you should be golden.... assuming you can caramelize lactose that is. ,Homebrewing,cfcckuv,1,t5_2qj8u

312149,0,t1_cfcspih,Sure they could make malt but there is a huge difference between feed stock barley and malting barley.  They are selected for different things and have different characteristics.  Feedstock needs to be high in protein to maximise livestock growth.  Malting barley needs to have specific percentages of protein no more than about  iirc good enzyme activity ie high diastatic power high germination rates no damaged husks low beta glucan... Basically what youll find in the feedstore are grains that have been rejected by maltsters unless you luck out and get some stock rejected for nonquality reasons.Not trying to put a downer on this project quite the contrary the more of the process performed by the consumer the closer their bond to the product.

335305,0,t3_1xxmmp,The traditional method is to add it all in the beginning.The new train of thought seems to be add some at the end because a you will carmelize less wort and the beer will remail lighter and b hop utilization is higher the less malt extract there is.

The latter method allows the water to evaporate thus taking any residual heat along with it. The former just creates a large area of ambient water to regulate. I use the former method and control the temperature by adding one or two ice bottles every  hours. Monitor the temperature of the water by placing the probe of a cheap digital thermometer and figure that during active fermentation the actual wort temp will be  F  C warmer so adjustregulate accordingly.This is how I do it and at times have  going at the same time each at different stages of fermentation.Edit a word,Homebrewing,cfq2c4a,2,t5_2qj8u

484162,0,t1_cfvar87,This works for allgrain brewing where you dont always know how much sugar you will get out of the mash  so you collect your wort mix it well and then take a gravity reading.  If you are low on BG boil gravity you can boil extra and start your hop additions later.  The drawback is increased wort darkening and Maillard reactions  in some styles such as Scotch ales this is a plus not a drawback.This technique is not applicable to extract brewing.  Edit it shouldnt be applicable to brewing extract because you have a set amount of gravity points of fermentables and usually are doing a concenbtrated boil.  I could see it being applicable if you decided to do a fullboil extract brew and then started with too much water in the kettle.,Homebrewing,cfvawib,2,t5_2qj8u

In the absence of federal legislation any applicable state legislation would control.If there is federal legislation the state may be free to legislate equally or more strictly or more loosely or may be preempted by the federal laws from regulating that activity more strictly  or at all.As far as the striking down federal MJ legislation that is not going to happen through the courts. The case of gay marriage is different because it implicates constitutional rights and fundamental human rights the courts decided. In the case of MJ it is just a good in the stream of commerce. The Supreme Court has taken an excessively broad in my opinion view of what constitutes commerce that can be regulated by the federal government under the commerce clause. MJ is a nobrainer as being eligible for federal prohibition or regulation considering that the Supremes are even willing to let the feds require people to affirmatively act to buy a commercial product medical insurance. The only way federal MJ laws will change is by Congressional action.  Once we have a majority of Congresspeople who have tried it but didnt inhale it should be gone after another decade or two.,Homebrewing,cfw2h9q,2,t5_2qj8u

540535,0,t1_cg1pdnw,Oh got it. The nylon hop bag has a much finer mesh than muslin bags so I think it should keep a lot of the hop trub in. I was thinking of finding a way to hold the mouth of the bag open and suspended in the kettle I guess this is what a hop spider is for? and just dumping all my hop additions in there at the appropriate times. As far as the strainer goes I recommend getting a stainless steel fine mesh strainer. I got mine at the dollar store for  though I dont really recommend getting it from the dollar store I ripped the mesh out of the frame in one spot. The good thing about the stainless steel mesh is you can scrape all the trub and stuff off it with a metal spoon to keep your wort flowing without worrying about damaging it. I DO NOT recommend one of those screen inserts they sell for funnels.

692350,0,t3_22386l,One of my favorite styles is Munich Dunkel. If you like rich malty yet easydrinking beers it is a must brew. umjap has a goldmedal winning recipe Im sure hed share if you asked nicely .Brewing a lager is pretty straightforward as long as you keep these thoughts in mind. Lagers require twice as much yeast as an ale of the same gravity. That means roughly  billion cells for a standard gravity lager. This usually means a gigantic starter.. Pitching and primary fermentation temps need to be cold.  degF is a good primary fermentation temperature but youll want to pitch about  degrees below that. Do not pitch warm unless for some reason you cant grow enough yeast.. When fermentation activity significantly slows it is recommended to let the beer warm up to about  degrees for  days to finish fermenting.. The cold crashconditioning is very important for a lager. You want your beer to be super clean and crisp in the bottlekeg so cool your beer down as much as possible at least  degrees below your fermentation temperature but some brewers take it down to  degrees. Let it sit there for at least  days but the longer the better.ubrulosopher has a quicklagering technique he uses that works well search for some of his posts.,Homebrewing,cgiz0ag,10,t5_2qj8u

697531,0,t1_cfutbad,I was just thinking about this... sorry about the delayed replied. First off it got to my house like  days after I bought it so that was pretty good service which I guess it should be with payed shipping and all. The kettle is HUGE! It looks pretty comical sitting on my stove. But fits perfectly on my propane burner. It came with the spigot but I had to install it myself. The included all the needed parts including rubber washers and and a small roll of silicone tape. It was pretty easy to install but I did have to go and get more silicone tape to properly seal it.  I brewed a  gallon batch  weeks ago and I think its perfect for what I need. I actually got close to a boil over but I think that was more due to limited experience. I am currently doing BIAB so just keep in mind if thats what youre doing that youll need a pretty big piece of cloth for it. And since I do BIAB I also use it as my mash tun. It worked great as a mash tun held the temperatures really well. I think the only reason it dropped any heat was that I was trying to drop the temp intentionally.  I thought  of the best features of this pot were the liquid volume markings and the spigot. This is the first pot I used with a spigot and it is so much nicer than using a siphon. And the kettle markings take out any guess work in that area.  If you have any other questions about it let me know!,Homebrewing,cgjk894,2,t5_2qj8u

745563,0,t3_22p9az,I moved onto my dream property last summer and to my surprise I found an abundance of old neglected fruit trees including three pear trees. By the time late summer came around and temperatures started to cool down the pears were still small and quite hard. After asking some people about them and doing a little research I came under the impression that whatever old heritage variety of pears these are the property and trees date back to at least the early slate s theyre probably not EATING pears but perry pears! apparently perry is the correct name for alcohol brewed from pear juice... afficionados DO NOT like it to be called pear cider. I guess cider is only supposed to refer to fermented apple juice.Anyway I crushed as many of the pears as I could into juice and what I didnt drink directly I placed in  glass demijohns to do a little experiment. One demijohn I inoculated with a commercial beer yeast one I inoculated with a commercial wine yeast and the last I didnt inoculate at all... I just let the natural yeasts do their thing. From what I read about traditional perry making youre supposed to leave it until spring so I put some airlocks on and put them in a cool dark part of the house.I checked on them now and then and everything seemed fine. Primary fermentation occurred quickly and a nice yeast cake settled out on the bottom. I was really keen on checking them about twice a month or so from SeptDec. Then things got busy around Christmas and I completely forgot about them until recently. When I went to check on them again I was horrified to see that the water in the airlocks had pretty much completely evaporated so the liquor has been exposed to the air. Also the liquor has developed some kind of white growth forming a skin at the top that wasnt there before the airlocks dried out.Ive never experienced anything like this before and Im kind of paranoid now. Is it completely ruined? Is it salvageable andor still safe to drink? What is this white growth on top?Any insight and advice you guys have would be very helpful.tldr Forgot about perry in storage area for months without checking and airlocks dried out.

I then plug these numbers into the Brewers Friend Water Calculator to see how much saltacidacidulated malt to add. The code for my latest beer a bock is XKCVF if you want to take a look at my stuff I did guess on the pH but I know from talking to our local micro and other homebrewers that our water pH is a bit higher due to our city using slaked lime to reduce hardness.I had to add a bit of gypsum and chalk as well as acidulated malt and  lactic to get my water where I was shooting for. Am I doing this correctly?Also I do a double dunk sparge with my BIAB setup to get a little bit higher efficiency since I only have a  gallon kettle. I added about . mL of  lactic to my . gallons of sparge water to neutralize the alkalinity. This is the first time Ive done that and I havent noticed any tannic flavors before but I thought I would see what happens. If someone that knows more than me would be able to comment on that itd be great.Im really planning on doing most of that for my darker beers. For lighter brews Ive been getting RO water from a local aquarium store and basically treating it like distilled water in terms of salt additions etc.,Homebrewing,cgp1a9z,3,t5_2qj8u

770288,0,t3_22yxiv,Patience is crucial and good planning makes patience easy. Early on I gave in to the temptation to try beers before they were ready and I was never happy with them. At the time I typically only had one batch in the works at a time. I wouldnt start a new batch until I was down to a few bottles of the previous batch.Ive since started paying a lot more attention to time frames and making sure I have a good pipeline. At any given moment I typically have one batch fermenting one bottle conditioning at least one on tap and one carbonating in a keg. That does away with the temptation to go cracking bottles open before theyve finished conditioning or bottling when a few more days in the fermenter might really clean up the flavors.In the past year or so Ive started treating brewing as less of an activity that I do and more an ongoing aspect of my life.

Q Not sure why your final gravity is so low. Again are you adjusting the hydrometer for temperature? As to priming the priming sugar provides all the sugar you need for carbonation. In the advice I didnt ask for category you do not need to transfer your beer to a secondary. It will be fine in your primary vessel for  weeks. If you dont need your primary vessel for another brew leave it in for three weeks and go straight to the bottle. It decreases the risk of infection.,Homebrewing,cgttm6v,3,t5_2qj8u

790703,0,t1_cgu5hb1,Youre welcome bud. That is just the tip of the brewburg.Youll want to make sure that all your grains get properly stirredexposed to your water yes thats the dough in part. Not doing so will cause you to miss your target gravity which you did. Id bet you that was the cause. You were only extracting sugars from the specialty grains not converting them as though they needed mashing. But it looks like you didnt quite extract enough sugars from the steeping grains. The temperature doesnt matter nearly as much here since you used a kit and youre really not mashing them. If and when you switch to allgrain brewing though mash temp is of paramount importance. It will likely frustrate you the first couple of times. I know it took me a few tries to get everything dialed in correctly.Use light malt extract for your starters. As pale as you can get. That way you wont add any unintended flavor to your wort when you pitch the starter. I wouldnt bother to try to use LME.

An empty barrel saturated with beer will quickly become a home to Acetobacter airborne vinegar producer and mold.

If youd quickly rinsed it then and burned a sulfur wick or filled with a metabisulfitecitric acid holding solution itd be in much better shape now.You could try filling the barrel completely with boiling water but even that may not be enough. Id probably go with a sour beer something that is going to have microbes in it already that will ferment out most of the carbohydrates and lower the pH.For my five gallon barrels I tried to refill them the same day they were emptied. For the last  months they sat filled with water. Another local Redditor saw me mention that and offered to take them off my hands so I rinsed them out and gave them to him on Sunday.

It turned out that it was better that that about  so my OG was like  points higher but it wasnt a big deal with the recipe I used.Like others have said pouring some water through the grain I heat up a gallon or two to  deg F while the mash is finishing for my sparge helps a lot to get those higher efficiency numbers.

First part is straight up flavor  add about a third to a half of an oz of the trimmings at flameout. This will ensure that it is sanitized and good flavoraroma extraction.Step two is to make a tincture to extract the THCCBD from the remaining material this is often called green dragon in certain circles. Now you can just get some Everclear or other grain alcohol and add the remaining plant material to it  itll eventually naturally decarboxylate but it takes forever and a day and you get poor conversion overall. The better plan is to heat it to decarboxylation temperatures in an oven before soaking it. Basically bake it in a thin layer at about F for about a half hour then use an alcohol base to extract the active compounds. You can use water too but again youre talking about poor extraction as THC readily dissolves in sugar alcohols or fats not in water.

998010,0,t3_25iwmb,Some wheat beers are suposed to be cloudy and clarity is almost always a cosmetic consideration unless you get the beer farts from yeast. Without cold crashing an average ale yeast will carb up in the bottles between  days depending on the kind of yeast amount of sugar and temperature. After cold crashing for a few days a beer will take between  days to carbonate. You can rehydrate a little yeast and throw it in with your bottling sugar to carb up a crashed beer fast. Ive done that before and it helps. However the general rule for homebrewing is that patience will make better beer. Give your beer  weeks to condition in the bottles anyway.  weeks makes superior beer. The problem is that ironically maybe paradoxically almost all of us homebrewers are pathologically impatient. Most of my batches are all gone before the  week mark and I always regret drinking it too soon.I wouldnt cold crash a wheat beer. Id just give it  days in the primary and  weeks in the bottles and enjoy it. I almost never cood crash ales. An easy shortcut is to put the bottles in the fridge for a few days or weeks before you drink them... the yeast crashes in the bottles... does the same thing. Just remember to rinse all your bottles out in the sink with hot water the same day you drink them... then all they will need is a little starsan on bottling day and theyre good to go.,Homebrewing,chhqbyv,1,t5_2qj8u

So you have to send back your first wort in HLT mix it with sparge water and send it back to sparge the grain.

Generally speaking this isnt considered aging well.Bigger beers with higher alcohol content will become more well rounded as their ageoxidize and that hot boozy burn mellows. Sour beers that are not pasteurized can develop more in the bottle with age. Gueuzes from Boon have  year best by dates for example. Off flavors from pedio can mellow over time.

You already started fermenting. There wasnt a huge lag meaning there was sufficient oxygen for yeast to do their thing.Sounds like you did good! For my first I confused a bag of grain and a bag of hops how? so I didnt get sugar from the grain or flavor from the hops and I added waaaay too much water.Also I dumped sugar directly into the wort to prime. Dont do this. Boil sugar in a cup or two of water put it in your bottling bucket rack on top of it making sure it swirls bottle half quick swirl with a sanitized spoon bottle the rest.So my sugar didnt mix leaving me with some bottle bombs and some flat wattery bitter beer.

1142113,0,t3_277h8w,Alright. First of all use a hydrometer. You cant tell by the bubbling alone. If theres a small leak somewhere in the lid or airlock CO could be escaping somewhere else. Thats fine you just wont see bubbles.I would let it sit another week check it with your hydrometer let it sit a few more days check it again. Its probably fine.The bottom line your yeast are not dead. If they were working yesterday they didnt just die overnight. They are pretty resilient.A few big questions that will help us help you. What recipe did you use? At least your Original Gravity. What temp wasis it fermenting at?. What yeast strain did you use?,Homebrewing,chy3kjg,3,t5_2qj8u

1148823,0,t1_chyj8ub,Dont you need a pump to push through the plate chiller? Ive never used one but I think it needs more pressure than you get from gravity alone. Also it might help you to transfer your strikesparge water from your kettle to your tun.Edit After looking it up it appears gravity fed plate chillers do indeed work but perhaps at a much reduced flow rate. The reduced flow rate however could be a plus if your chilling water is relatively warm.,Homebrewing,chyut8m,1,t5_2qj8u
1149694,0,t3_27ack8,You can make great beer from very simple equipment.  The things like siphons are just to make that process easier.  One question though can you boil  liters of liquid?  Because you are going to have to boil that beer with the hops for a period of time.  It is usually an hour but it depends on style.Since you point out a Bohemian Lager do you also have a way to ferment it cold and step it down as it ends?  Making lagers is must harder than an ale for this reason.  As for an airlock really they are not needed.  What you are trying to do is keep things bacteria wild yeasts flies out of the wort until the yeast take hold.  You can simply lay the lid on top if you like.  But if you want to drill a hole put a tube in the hodl and run the other end into a container of water.  Just make sure it is sealed. Also  liters of wort weighs about  kg.  Are you sure you can move and handle that much at a time?  I would stick to  liter batches until you get a good idea of all the work and cleaning involved.As for how much yeast there are many calculators available.  But as long as you are not making a high gravity beer generally any packaged beer yeast will work just fine.  The dry yeasts have more cells than the liquid but should be hydrated first. But expect to make a few mistakes and learn from them.  It is how everyone I know including myself started. And never forget brewing is  sanitation and  fermentation. ,Homebrewing,chyycv1,1,t5_2qj8u

1222443,0,t1_ci1m33b,fyi brewing yeast is a special strain that can continue to breedsurvive at higher alcohol contents so you could get some fermentation with whatever yeast but it will likely die off at a low alcohol and the contamination youll get from the... uh... collection area will likely taint the flavor as other things compete with the yeast ala sour dough bread so I think youd be better off adding a pure strain of yeast or keeping a starter. Keeping a starter is a giant pain in the ass but the reason keeping a starter living colony of yeast growing is because finding a good yeast that can ferment well is probably more difficult.BUt realistically if someone told me to make beer with yeast I had to harvest Id rather make bread let it sit out and collect wild yeast and after a couple weeksmonths as the yeast grew more and more to out compete the bacteria Id just use that for brewing. I think that might be better in the sense that you know what youre working with.Also thrush yeast is a special kind of yeast and I dont fancy it would be delicious because as twisted as your question is I assume you someone through history HAS used thrush yeast even if they only made bread after mastubating or something and I dont think it... uh... took off. ,Homebrewing,ci7564w,1,t5_2qj8u

1369010,0,t3_29rqw4,Honestly actual brewday equipment  cooler vs HERMS  RIMS  has been all about consistency for me   hitting the numbers and never really about quality improvements. But you could argue either way I suppose. One gets you the other sort of thing is probably true. In the end I settled on an electric recirculated system for different reasons. If a cooler helps you hold mash temps and thats what you can afford  do it. If you only can only swing one gallon BIAB with your limited space or whatever the reason make it work.Sanitation ferm temps pitching water  in this order really made a difference for me. Control ferm temps first yeast health and pitching rates and if you dont know your source water buy some bottled spring water and worry about water last.Dont be afraid to use dry yeast to get pitching rates you need if you cant do starters. You are better off using properly rehydrated dry yeast than you are using old liquid yeast packs and no starter. Ive recently gone back to using dry yeast for many reasons one of which is convenience as I have limited brewing time.  For example I used to have a lot more time to brew I did all sorts of yeast culturing brewed small batches all the time on my small electric system with a cooler. But I really dont have time now to brew that often. So I have a larger system for doing  gallons and break that out into as many different beers as I can. I keep dry yeasts on hand so I can brew at the drop of a hat with proper pitch rates and healthy yeast and not have to worry about doing huge stepped starters etc. I nochill my wort into containers to save me a little time on brewday and ferment the next day. Ive spent a lot of time figuring out what works for me at this moment. Its not ideal but its what I can control.Water chemistry will drive you crazy. Gusher bottles will happen. All of these details can get you down. Control the things you can and do them one step at a time or you might get overwhelmed. You are going to read and hear a lot about do this do that but you just need to find what works for you and your situation. And the best advice I can give  just keep brewing. If you love it everything will fall into place eventually. ,Homebrewing,cinw6w5,0,t5_2qj8u

I lumped you in with others who have  as I think that by and large the issues people have tend to fall into one major category  i.e. not as scientific as they would like.gtThe suggesting you are making that the pitch rate has more to do with the results than the psychology of preference is ludicrous.Huh.  Funny that the gravities of the beers were different scientifically measurable difference that seemed to be perceived in the flawed responses.  One took noticeably longer to ferment.  Effects to flavor have been well documented in beers with long lag times but you discount that entirely in favor of worrying that people knew the beers were different to begin with.Heres the thing I see about it  unless ubrulosopher takes the beers to a lab and has them analyzed pretty close to  of the data he collects is going to be at least somewhat subjective since it is opinion based.  gtand how the data is collected is the entire experiment.This is what I cant wrap my head around.  Silly me thought that the experiment was about harvested yeast vs. factory vial.  Im personally more interested in the hard data points differences in gravity lag times clarity etc.  From there the aggregated opinions are interesting but even if  prefer one over the other its such a small sample size that you have to take that with a grain of salt.  An experiment with  subjects carried out completely to scientific protocols is only mildly interesting unless its been repeated multiple times.  ubrulosopher is probably never going to have ONE exBEERiment with  participants.

1546340,0,t3_2bxxrj,The European countries kept a tight hold on what could be manufactured in their colonies and they did not allow production of ales in the colonies until the mids I believe. So beer had to be shipped to the colonies and most of that probably originated from England. Likewise wines and brandies were made in Europe and shipped in. The colonial powers were very interested in having the colonies produce a lot of sugarmolassesbased spirits like rum and that was one of the primary exports back to Europe. Thus the colonies were awash in rum and I will bet that  of what was available to pirates was rum or lowergrade molassesbased spirits. In the North American colonies while we see that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson brewed beer we also know that they were experimental entrepreneurs and were also trying to be vintners and drank a ton of imported wine. The predominant liquor of the American colonies was apple jack a harsh distilled ciderbased beverage often called whiskey. Whatever ales that the pirates drank were therefore brewed in Europe most likely England and likely plundered or purchased at a very dear price.Two great sources for you to find proper vintage recipes are Randy Moshers book Radical Brewing and Ron Pattinsons blog Shut Up About Barclay Perkins.TLDR I speculate that to be historically accurate you should just brew vintage English recipes from whatever pirate era you are interested in.,Homebrewing,cja3vjt,3,t5_2qj8u

Id applied to be a brewer but no work was available so they gave me the bar job. Worked that parttime for a couple of months before being promoted to fulltime events work and bar supervision for a few more months before I finally found a way into the brewery. Even then I spent most of my time as a warehouse manager not as a proper brewer. But it was close enough I was on the floor and it got me the experience I needed to go further.Its just about getting known in the industry showing people youre intelligent and a hard worker.

1612824,0,t1_cjifx6n,I use pellets and not a whole lot of them I am not an IPA fan. I just put them into a paint strainer bag tie it off with a string and suspend it into the brewpot about half way down and tie the string off on the pot handle. When stirring the pot I will move the bag around a bit to encourage circulation through it. At flame out I untie the sack dunk it a couple of times and just let it drain into the wort. A couple of times I opened the bag for late additions to the boil but for the most part I just use all the hops for the full  minutes. Some of the solid hop residue remains in the bag and I just dumprinse it. Most of the rest drops to the bottom of the brewpot and is eliminated when I siphon.Quite simple but most likely not for everyone.,Homebrewing,cjigovv,1,t5_2qj8u

1668546,0,t1_cjpgt4l,I am not sure you had a problem in the first place. Foaming is a common symptom of carbonating beer that has not had time for CO to fully dissolve. It can also be a symptom of other problems like infections but two days is not long enough for some of those problems to occur. It sure seems like you didnt add enough sugar for bottle bombs. If the beer was at F then  oz. of corn sugar dextrose should give you . volumes of carbonation which is high for an oatmeal stout recommended at . vol. for a stout and I would say lower for an oatmeal stout  maybe . vol. but not close to being a bottle bomb if you used nondefective glass.  An ordinary oz. longneck can contain . vol. although I would be hesitant to go over . vol.Next time you can use a priming sugar caclulator for better control. This time you may have blindly stumbled into the . volumes range by uncapping the bottles once. For best results wait  weeks plus  hours in the fridge. ,Homebrewing,cjphcy5,1,t5_2qj8u

In this case it will take a day or three for the yeast to wake up so you might want to go  weeks plus  hours.

1710092,0,t3_2dux7e,Ive answered similar questions to this regarding carbing wine or cider in glass bottles. Ive copied my old response below the only thing to add is that if you dont plan on carbing it you can skip straight to pasteurization after bottling. Either way this will get you a stable beverage in a glass bottle that will keep for far longer than a week with  risk of bottle bombs.Bottle and cap once it tastes how you want it. If bottling at a higher gravity you can ignore the priming sugar if at lower gravity then youll need to add some. Take a oz plastic bottle and fill it up as well cap tightly. Regularly test the oz bottle by squeezing it until it gets hard rimshot. Once the oz bottle is hard then you can be pretty confident you have correct carbonation when I do this with cider I bottle at . and am carbonated in less than  hours. Test one of the wine bottles to confirm that it isnt overcarbed.Now it gets fun. You have to kill the yeast. You could put it in the fridge but that will only put it to sleep not kill it. Instead get a large pot of water up to around F. Turn off the heat put in  or  bottles of wine making sure the water covers up to the fill mark cover the pot and wait  minutes. Pull out the bottles and put them on the counter to cool down while you heat the pot back up to F for the next cycle. Rinse and repeat.Heating the bottles kills the yeast after they carbonate the bottle you should see them all fall out of suspension very quickly. This leads to a sweet if you like sparkling cider or wine that has no chance of having bottle bombs.Some caveats you dont want to do this with an overcarbed bottle. That would be dangerous for obvious reasons. You also cant tell how long it will take to carb so do this on a day when you can hang around and test the oz bottle.,Homebrewing,cjupwbs,2,t5_2qj8u

Id check out The Brewing Network shows on RIS to get some good tips Jamil Show on RIS from  Jamil Show on RIS from Also for high gravity brews I like to use Servomyces and then add yeast nutrient after it has been fermenting for a couple of days.

Will there be other Alcohol involved wine liquor. I suggest kegging and a jockey box or have a bottling party. Damn! I would not want to bottle that much beer by hand. Buy your bottles instead of re using old bottles. QC is going to be huge for this as there are more risks associated with bottling this many beers. Buy ingredients in bulk once you formulate your recipes. you can buy DME in  sacks. Since it sounds like you are doing extract batches look into the full boil and late extract methods. It really makes a better quality beer For the weddings  people I started  months in advance. I did  batches of each beer and I do  gallon batches for insurance I started with the higher gravity and dark beers first Triple and Irish Red Ale. I also rarely secondary and keep beers in the primary for roughly  weeks.   I only had a  tap kegerator at the time so I naturally carbed most of the kegs. If you are going to do any high gravity beers and are bottle conditioning give them plenty of time  a few months I had a Bourbon vanilla Porter and Wheat wine take . months to carb in the bottle. Hoppier beers are best fresh so do those lastYou can re use Starsan solutionGet a Ferrari bench Capper and mount it to a table. I have a white resin table brewing table that I mount mine to. an old piece of butcher block would work also. get a vinnator  Mine has a flat base use a short length of tubing to connect your bottling wand to your bucket.

1878446,0,t3_2g3xcs,If you are adding table sugar sucrose to a beer it should be sometime during the boil. Sucrose is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. Breaking them apart otherwise known as invertinginvert simple syrup requires heat and acid. Boiling wort is hot enough and acidic enough to do the job.If you want to add sugar to a beer after it has gone through primary fermentation I would suggest making the simple syrup on the stove top with a little lemon or cream of tartar as your acid. Belgian candi sugar is exactly this plus letting the temp go a little higher to darken it. If you dont want to make it yourself you can buy Belgian candi sugar or use honey.The darkness of the candi sugar provides little color to the finished beer compared to the use of roastedkilned malts. That said I dont plan to use much in the way of dark candi sugar. Clear candi sugar is easily accomplished by adding sucrose to your boil. After knowing how easy it is to make candi sugar for brewing I would never buy it from the store. Here is a good link on how to make it,Homebrewing,ckfjnwr,2,t5_2qj8u

You can get a carbonic bite from force carbing like you did  that should clear up over time and may contribute some of the off flavors.But really what I think you are describing is that the defining flavors in your beers  spices in the pumpkin ale hop aroma and flavor in the Ace and esters in the Saison  are gone. First these flavors are extremely volatile. In my experience spice beers and IPAshopheavy beers are best drank fresh though with spice beers I often give them a week to settle in the keg. Thats not to say the flavors are gone in a week just dont be surprised if they fade a bit or even a lot over time. The saison is a bit of a mystery but  and this is true for the other beers as well  you are probably serving them too cold.

If the pressure drops you have a very slow leak if it doesnt youre good to go.  Ive found quite a few leaks in cheaper shutoff valves on manifolds this way.  Something you wouldnt notice with a cursory soap test.  If you bought it used its a very good idea to go ahead and change the lines out anyway.

2030759,0,t3_2i19be,I think I just responded to you in the QampA thread but this isnt a bad price for a kit like that.  What you are looking at are kits using extract.  Brewing with extract is like making a cake with one of those premade cake mixes.  Most of the work is already done for you but its a little more expensive than making it from scratch.  In addition a double IPA is going to have a lot of hops in it and hops are much more expensive per ounce than extract or grains.I linked to a kit in my other response the Northern Brewer Essential Starter kit which includes all the equipment you would need to get started including a recipe kit for your first brew.  If you really want to make the double IPA go for it but youll still need equipment!Another person commented to go with a BIAB or allgrain.  Going back to that cake analogy  allgrain brewing is like baking a cake from scratch.  Its a little more involved and a little more complicated and is a little more expensive to get started.  If youre interested in doing that were happy to point you in the right direction.  Allgrain brewing is cheaper per batch because the ingredients are cheaper but its a little more expensive up front due to equipment costs.,Homebrewing,ckxycrq,2,t5_2qj8u

Dont ever use the bugs under the LME lid you dont want them.Also Bonus advice I give to all starting brewers Buy another kit so you can start another brew the day that you bottle that way youll start to have a rotation going by the time your bottled beers are ready so that you can let at least some of them sit for the for a good    weeks and let them fully develop.Oh and have fun!

And of course .oz of lemon skittles lemon heads and lemon sweet tarts in secondary for dry hopping.Tasting notes This beer had a significant amount of chill haze but became crystal clear when it warmed up. If I was to do it again I would do a  split between wheat and pilsner wheat being the majority of the malt. I would also scale the hops by half use a noble hop to bitter instead of chinook imo chinook gives off too much of a harsh flavor for bittering get rid of amarillo personal preference and let the belgian wit yeast dominate the beer more.

You reference the mL vials because they have graduations on them and you often talk about how many mL of slurry you have.Do you have a good idea of how many cells are in that slurry? Or do you just calculate it proportional to the total cells in the slurry? e.g. Brewers Friend says b cells so if you have mL of slurry then  mL is b cells?

2427141,0,t3_2n9kzr,You want to pitch around F where the yeast are most active and then cool to your fermentation temp specific to your yeast type. Personally I dont think you need to cold crash a starter. One of the points of a starter is to grow the number of cells.  Also though so the yeast can be pitched in their most active state as to quickly overwhelm the wort heading off any other nasties in there and begin doing their job in the fastest and least stressed manner. Lessing lag time is important in homebrewing to stay off infections. Cold crashing puts yeast back into a dormant state taking them from their ideal conditions after which theyve got to get back into the swing of things. Youre doing the brewing equivalent of footballs Icing the Quarterback.The extra  ml of beer that youre getting from your starter wont make any difference in your overall batch profile. Just make your starter a day or so out brew bring your wort down to F and pitch directly. ,Homebrewing,cmbp9ue,0,t5_2qj8u

2440070,0,t3_2nf8on,Congratulations on your new brews!  An Oktoberfest isnt a Pilsner they are both lagers.  A Pilsner is a pale yellow color like BudMillerCoors.  Typically Oktoberfest is darker and maltier than a Pilsner by a big margin.  Either way they are both lagers and they should use lager yeast ferment cold then age colder preferably.  How are you doing it?  Oktoberfests are carbed a bit higher than a pilsner.  The high end of the range puts you at psi but you can carbonate your kegged beer to whatever level you want.  If you need to get it carbed fast you can put psi on the keg and shake it until it doesnt keep taking gas.  Repeat that in twenty minutes.  Then put it on your desired psi and repeat and see it it takes gas.  If it takes gas put it back up to  and do it again.  If it doesnt take gas then you are done.  It will have carbonation right away but it usually isnt nicely carbed until it rests hopefully at least a couple days.,Homebrewing,cmdaqp4,2,t5_2qj8u

2530071,0,t1_cmoqtlx,Seriously man that would not work.  Judges need some guidelines to work from.  Which is better this British Mild or this DIPA?  Good is totally subjective.  To Style and Good is much less.Edit Judging is hard.  Generally you know nothing about the beer going in.  Usually you know the style but in specialtyfruit categories you sometimes done even know that.  Youve all seen taste test things on TV where they blindfold people and give them different foods and they cant tell em apart.  Well beer judging is kinda like that.  We all know how complex brewing is and ingredients and style can vary broadly so its real hard to know whats going on.  In the ciders this year I gave some guy low marks because I thought his cider was infected.  Turns out hed hit it with Brett.  So yes it was infected but it was on purpose and we had no way to know.  Another was a blueberry one that some judges thought was blueberry extract but no it was tons of real blueberries and some other phenolic character from an unknown source.  Offering no guidelines at all makes it even harder.  You have to judge a beer as good or not good based on what?  Nothing?  Personal preference?  You really want a comp where youre being judged based on what your judge likes?  What if the pair of judges BTW if we do the comp again it really NEEDS to be paired judges disagree about a beer god forbid!.  ,Homebrewing,cmoteoo,5,t5_2qj8u

They are based in London which is a costly endeavor however they are widely recognized as one of the major worldwide leaders in brewing education. SABMiller uses them for a lot of their continuing education for their brewers. They offer online classes that are still relatively expensive or you can buy the textbooks study on your own then take the final tests remotely this is what I did each test is  hours long all essay and there is  parts taken over three days. It is intense and extremely difficult.. Just taking the tests will cost you about .k and is the equivalent of a  year degree from the states. From there if you pass you can take the next level of tests to get what is the equivalent of a masters degree in the united states. I highly recommend it as it allowed me to continue to work as a project engineer for Cargill and get paid full time while I got a second degree.

2613303,0,t1_cmzmrvs,gt My general assumption has been dark beers age well. Is this correct Thats not necessarily correct. Beers that are high in original gravity high alcohol tend to age well. Beers that are designed to have fresh hop flavor like citrusy American IPAs wont tend to age so well.First lets separate ordinary conditioning of beer letting is sit for a few extra weeks  that tends to work well for all beers. But when talking about extended aging...You have to think about what aging does to a beer and whether you want that. Hops will fade. Malt will come out. Slight oxidation may set in creating sherry or leather notes. Small amounts of acetic acid may be formed creating a slight sourness. Basically the things that make aged beers complex.

2746551,0,t1_cng8aiz, For reference I have an  gallon stainless stock pot and used to start with  gallons of water. about a gallon evaporates during the boil time  Even with  extra gallons of headspace Ive had a couple small boil overs in the beginning.  Now I just start with . gallons and add in enough distilled water to cover the difference at the end.  This actually speeds up the process  fold  Adding the . gallons of chilled distilled water at the end cools the wort the last  degrees from  to  pretty much instantly and I dont have to worry about boil overs at all with the lower starting gallons can go full blast on the burner to bring it to boil temps in minutes.  I use the copper coil to bring it from  down to  in a few minutes and the last  degrees usually the slowest  degrees with chilled distilled water to instantly drop temp to happy yeast temps.                                         The point of all this rambling is that having a borderline size pot forced me to change my method which actually sped up the whole process faster than if I could safely do a full boil.  It also saves propane getting to boil temps faster and once reached requires less gas to keep it there.  Adding chilled water at the end saves a lot of time reducing your temperature to .  And for the purist in me I cant tell any difference in taste or quality between a batch that was completed full boil and a batch that was a lower gallon boil with . gallons of water added at the end to bring the concentrate wort to proper volume.

I picked up the . big mouth glass bubbler should I transfer it over still or just use a blow off tube? Edit I own the L spiedel as well but I let my friend borrow it. Also Thanks a ton to everyone on this subreddit for helping me along the way to brewing my first batch this is my second batch and I hope Its not ruined. ,Homebrewing,cnkzxw3,3,t5_2qj8u

2905446,0,t3_2tejqj,Heres why I recommend doing at least one or two batches as extract The starting cost is lower and less fiddly. Walk in with  walk out with a kit capable of making  gallons of beer. Ive watched people walk into the homebrew store when I was working and walk right back out when they saw that cost. My rote line was that this hobby is a lot cheaper than golf Extract with grains is an easier process to follow that still feels like making beer.  extract brewing feels like youre missing steps of the brewing process Extract is a lot faster to pull off for a first time brewer. Gotta ease your friends family and yourself into realizing that youre going to be spend the better part of a day tinkering with beermaking. Extract can happen on the standard kitchen stove  all grain at volume is a lot hardy  though I did it for  years. Most important Extract brewing allows a new brewer to focus on figuring out sanitation and fermentation  the two most critical skills  before adding in all the worry and bother of crap I missed my gravitytemperaturepHwater profilelove handlessparge volume yada yada yada.Some of this changes when you introduce small batch brewing to the process but I still think extract at full volume is the way to go for new folks so you can get the full excitement of sharing your beer.  bottles goes a lot further than !I learned a lot of stuff doing my first  batches as extract with grains so I still think its a good way to go. I think things like BIAB speed up the transition to AllGrain but I also admittedly still sneak in an extract batch from time to time when I need beer and am pressed for time. Extract produces great beer once you know what youre doing sanitation and fermentation wise.,Homebrewing,cnycsmz,21,t5_2qj8u

Having had mostly IPAS with high head retention we usually ended up with a pour like the picture. I will use longer lines to correct the problem.

That dude is smart when it comes to beer and hops.Im not sure if Ill ever do a side by side on the FWH vs standard...Id like to because Id like to know for myself but who knows. I think the idea of using an aroma hop for FWH is pretty silly though. Theres no way that the aroma is even close to the same as using that same hop at flameout.One other thing are you transferring with co and purging everything with CO? This seems to make a huge difference. Its one of the reasons I like dry hopping while there is still yeast activity. The extra co blowing off can get the o out that is introduced with the hops.

2935240,0,t3_2trrcw,Are you sure you need acid malt? I highly doubt you will considering you will be using roasted malts which will add plenty of acidity. Id start by doing your water adjustments and see if you really need it.Next Id drop the melanoidin. You arent going to get much flavor from it considering you have a Munich heavy base and roast malt in there. It will go largely unnoticed so Id drop it in favor of something else. Probably some sort of roasted malt considering you dont have much in there. Id throw in at least  ounces of roasted barley thus eliminating the need for blackprinz.If you want chocolate flavors you should use pale chocolate malt over chocolate malt. I love it mixed with munich it adds an excellent chocolate flavor. Regular chocolate malt tends to be more coffeelike than anything.If youre shooting for a  beer which is fine I would use more hops for bittering. Dont use Saaz either theyre very low in AA and much better as a late addition. Use Warriors or Magnums theyre high in AA which makes it easier to hit your IBU and have a very clean bitterness. Id bump the IBU up to  or so which will help balance the alcohol and roasted astringency.,Homebrewing,co1qzcn,3,t5_2qj8u

2954867,0,t1_co3rcyc,To add onto what nikosuave said you need to factor in grain absorption into your calculations and dead space in your tun and kettle. If I were you I would mash with as much water as will fit in your mash tun which is what I think niko is recommending. You need to get well above  quarts per lb before you start to notice drops in efficiency. People use lower ratios because of space issues. Next drain completely after the mash and figure out what you need to get your preboil volume. I would guess you need . gallons preboil at least and you will get about three from you first runnings. You should split your sparge water into two equal amounts to get better efficiency because  pounds is a decent amount of grain and it will hurt your lauter efficiency. You should also take a gravity sample from your preboil sweet wort and let it cool while your kettle heats up. Brewing software will tell you what your target is. You will then add time to your boil of it is too low or add water if too high. I know you said you are expecting low efficiency on your first brew but I hit  on my first brew. My goal is  right now but sometimes I hit  by accident and need to add some water to my kettle or skip the second sparge to bring it into line. So make sure you measure your volumes and gravity at every step of the process and adjust it accordingly. oh and seeing as this is your first time plan to overshoot your strike temp. You can add some cold water to bring it down if you are well over or you can stir it quickly if it is only a degree over. A few minutes over temp doesnt make a difference. Raising the temperature of lbs of grain and lbs of water a couple of degrees takes a lot of boiling water. So it is easier to start high and lower than it is to raise it up.  ,Homebrewing,co3zdvx,1,t5_2qj8u

Not enough interest? The project fizzles and nobody is charged. If you reach your funding goal whatever  of these glasses costs then Kickstarter collects from everyone who pledged and gives it to you minus whatever their percentage is which is probably pretty generous to them tbh.Plus that takes care of documentation in case of an audit gives money to you in a lump sum without you having to worry about collecting Paypal from everyone and all that overhead and Kickstarter also handles shipping addresses for people.I have handled a Tshirt order for a group that came together kind of the way youre talking about doing this and it was kind of a nightmare tracking and fulfilling everything.That said any way you decide to fulfill this Im in for  glasses.,Homebrewing,cobgrz2,2,t5_2qj8u

If it was more than you wanted greatmore beer!There are several apps out there which will help with this. Or if you want to do it by hand Designing Great Beers by Daniels has most of the maths.

3085428,0,t3_2vhxn9,I have a couple of troubleshooting ideas for you to try What are you sanitizing with? Taken from How to Brew by John PalmerMedicinal  These flavors are often described as mediciney BandAid like or can be spicy like cloves. The cause are various phenols which are initially produced by the yeast. Chlorophenols result from the reaction of chlorinebased sanitizers bleach with phenol compounds and have very low taste thresholds. Rinsing with boiled water after sanitizing is the best way to prevent these flavors. Temperature control is huge when it comes to yeast health and ester formation. The first beer I made had so much banana character that I could hardly believe it. I was just letting it get too warm.

Any money from your employment is easy you declare that on your tax return every year. So if they saw the money coming into your bank account for the RedditMade campaign they would ask why didnt you declare this income?Answer is simple  you didnt profit from this at all. You were simply having money in money out. In order to document and prove this you need to keep any and all receipts from the money you spend. So the invoice from the glass maker would be your biggest expense. Any money spent on shipping keep your receiptsinvoices.

3178068,0,t3_2wjf0b,From my experience I can offer the following yes rinsed yeast can last  to  weeks easily in the refrigerator.  Longer times and you may need to jump start it a bit before pitching. IMHO the cost of dry yeast is low enough that I dont bother to reuse it.  That being said I do use almost exclusively liquid yeasts.  The liquid yeasts offer more variety of strains available and at least in my anecdotal experience seem to be cleaner fermenting.  That said there are many beers probably better brewed than mine that have been made with dry yeasts.  You can use a jar and malt starter to bring your yeast up to pitchable levels.  Just plan on having a good amount of head space in your jar and shaking it at any time you pass by to help with resuspension of the yeast for better growth rates.  I typically use Homebrewdads yeast calculator or Mr. Malty to figure approximate yeast quantities.  Which brings up another point unless you are set up to do cell counts I could be but dont  remember this is supposed to be fun what you are pitching is a crude approximation of the cell numbers.  Yeast luckily are very forgiving and I believe that there is a pretty good sized window for error.    Most yeast strains are pretty flexible in the styles of beer they can be used in for decent results.  Check out the Wyeast web site click on the description for a given strain and you will see a good number of beer styles for which that strain is recommended.  Given that it is from a stout kit it is most likely an English strain and will be pretty versatile.  Heres how I rinse my yeast cake  I have jars of sterilized water that I have prepared in advance using a pressure cooker.  I dump one of the jars approximately a quart jar into the emptied carboy on top of the yeast cake.  I shake it up well to get the yeast and trub into suspension and then allow it to sit and settle for at least  min to an hour.  I then pour off the liquid portion back into the empty water jar.  I will allow this to settle a bit and then stick it in my refrigerator to crash the yeast out of solution.  about  hours after being put in the refrigerator I wil take it back out and examine it.  If the bottom is almost all yeast white to offwhite and creamy I will decant most of the clear waterbeer solution and put it back in the fridge for use.  If the bottom solids are a mix of mealy trub and yeast looks grainy not creamy I will decant the water and use another sterlized jar of water to repeat the rinsing.  When done I usually get the nice creamy yeast cake on the bottom of the jar.  I will then estimate the amount of yeast cake in ml and use a figure of  to  billion cells per ml based upon how clean it looks.  Then I go to the yeast calculators I mentioned above to figure if I need to generate more yeast for the upcoming batch.,Homebrewing,corell3,4,t5_2qj8u

3233393,0,t1_cox4s6u,Its not an OR or an XOR its an AND. You need to be sparging with water above  AND have a pH above . to have tannin extraction. This means that you did not extract tannins with your sparge and you should look elsewhere for the problem.gt Does this mean the lowered ph was the cause of my astringency?No it does notgt These malts have astringent and harsh tastes associated with them but they are usually in conjunction with traditional roasted malt flavors. These flavors arent caused by the low pH they just happen to be present in more acidic roasted malts.So these malts are acidic and when used can add flavors that can be perceived as astringent and bitter. Roasted malts add these flavors regardless of pH.gt But I was reading where the PH of the water doesnt really matter.It does matter but it to a small degree. The pH and alkalinity combined are indicative of the bicarbonate and carbonate concentration in the water which is what absorbs the acidity of the mash. If these values are higher your alkalinity and pH are higher you will have to counteract with more acidacidulated malt. However without these values you will have to correct realtime on brew day.gt And does adding some i.e. a specific amount to be calculated on brew day baking soda the answer?Adding baking soda should never be the answer. You should only be using baking soda as a verylastresort option. Adding any sodium can have detrimental effects on the overall flavor of the finished beer. You are better off adding alkalinity using a different salt such as pickling lime or potassium bicarbonate.gt I made two batches one light one dark and the darker one ended up with astringency.This tells me right away that the roasted malts in use were the source of your astringency. You are probably just tasting the roasted malt contribution. What was your malt bill?,Homebrewing,cox5avn,1,t5_2qj8u

He must have around  kegs conditioning and he only has  taps on his.

3309172,0,t1_cp5e16f,I live in Portland I treat my water before brewing. The main reason being that our water supply you can treat as basically RO water. Its the cleanest in the country by a fair margin because of the Bull Run reserve feeding most of the city.What that means for brewers is that you can build any profile you want when your additives in the municipal water are basically  ppm across the board. My standard additions are calcium chloride and gypsum. I brew .gal batches and generally am adding tsp of each in an average batch less or more depending on the water profile Im shooting for but tsp of each is a pretty balanced profile. Ive noticed the strongest uptick in quality with my IPAs. Adding about .tsps of Gypsum has really made a difference as far as the hop character accented by the water.

In either case this may be a good time to play around with some post fermentation additions. Something to add character but play on the lack of maltiness. I am thinking fruit additions namely cherries black or sour if it were me. They will add character a bit of body and some sweetness. Dont dump it until you try it and maybe get creative.

Mason jars are designed for vacuum sealing not outward pressure.  The c escapes and the beer doesnt carbonate.To save work on reusing bottles pour beer into glasses instead of drinking it from the bottle.  Then you can just rinse and stick upside down on a rackbottle tree.  When it comes to bottling time just a quick cycle in the dishwasher sans detergent or a dip in sanitizer will do the trick.

3392596,0,t3_2z1xrb,It could work. Definitely burp and recap the over carbed ones.Youd have to math out the amount of sugar. Its probably something like half a teaspoon per bottle. So assume you have  bottles undercarbed put  Tbsp plus  Tsp of sugar into  Tbsp plus  tsp of water and heatmix till dissolved.You need about  tsp or  mL of this solution. Take your eye dropper drop out  drops of water into a small glass  drops is mL pick all of it back up in the dropper and make a mark where the liquid level is. Dump this and you now have a decently precise measurement for your bottles.Add mL  .mL  of these and call it a day imo just in the off chance there is more sugar in the bottles the yeast will scavenge. The water means youre actually adding about  tsp so if you feel like there is absolutely no carbonation you can add up to mL x.I think my math and science is correct if its wrong anyone feel free to correct me.,Homebrewing,cpezdxo,1,t5_2qj8u

3397152,0,t1_cpesik9,Think of it this way. You have billions of yeast going at the sugars and maybe a few million wild yeastbacteria. The beer yeast will get the first crack at the sugars because their is just so many more. Once they are done the wild yeast and bacteria that can breakdown longer chains get their chance to consume the wort. Also as their is a lot less of them it will take your wild yeast longer to multiply and take hold. Hence the delay before the pellicle showed.  Id ride it out and see what kind of sour beer you end up with. But freezing kills nothing. Whoever is spreading that needs to stop.

So will much of the protein matter if you add finings in the kettle I do with WhirflocT.While there is plenty of evidence that racking all your hopstrub to the fermentor makes no difference and may help to get clear beer im saying that if excess protein is a concern then you should leave some or all of the break material behind when racking to the fermentor.I dont have any evidence for this but from reading old Brewing Techniques issues and some other materials I think IMO  the cutting edge thinking in the mids remains true you want to leave out hot break material but racking some or all of the cold break to the fermentor may help yeast health. The technique to do that requires some thinking and probably requires doing a whirpool and then a counterflowstyle chiller.,Homebrewing,cpj7kqy,1,t5_2qj8u

3480334,0,t1_cpoxacj,This beer didnt receive a ton of hops see recipe in article but I dont strain them in the boil so we can assume a fairly large portion made it to the hightrub carboy. That said Im not really advocating for anything just presenting a little data I collected. Ultimately its up to each brewer to decide what they want to do. Personally I dont intentionally transfer a ton of trub to my carboys even after these results though I do make a point to not worry about it and even take measures to ensure some trub is racked.Cheers!,Homebrewing,cpozek7,1,t5_2qj8u

3490131,0,t1_cppxf50,A sack of grain requires two   gallon buckets. Assuming you bought a bunch of row I would recommend leaving some of those bags intact and burn through them direct from the sack.  That way you will have enough room to keep your caramels lightdark and roasted grains in the gamma lid buckets. Also look into O absorbers if you plan to keep anything on hand for more that  months pretty cheap insurance policy. ,Homebrewing,cpq3lrs,6,t5_2qj8u
3490420,0,t1_cppourk,The rate at which heat transfers from the solid ice compared to the liquid water should change water should be able to absorb heat faster with no air gaps as would happen in an ice bottle but the overall energy required to heat up that bottle of salt water would be lower I think as melting ice takes a lot of energy.Since changing the bottles is no issue the increased rate of heat transfer is actually a big help.

3540358,0,t3_30tutj,I think I started with a  starter kit from midwest a  turkey fryer with an  gal aluminum stockpot from menards and a  extract kit. So if youre going all grain add about  for a cooler mash tun with fittings if you build it your self and theres .   left.  Wort chiller they range in cost depending on how much copper it has  bucks.  Fermentation control stc is about   as long as you can follow basic wiring instructions along with a chamber built or old fridgefreezer.  These costs vary obviously but craigslist is your freind with old freezers or fridges. As long as you can find a good working fridgefreezer at an affordable cost I spent  on my  cu ft one.

3675827,0,t1_cqb2m50,Let it sit for another two or three weeks and then taste it. Youre only  hours into fermentation! Theres really no reason to open your fermenter for at least two weeks on a . beer and Id wait at least  personally. Youre probably tasting all kinds of weird stuff because the yeast are still actively fermenting!If your ambient temperature was  degrees it could have been as hot as  degrees inside the fermenter. For example the thermostat in my apartment is reading F but the thermometer stuck on the carboy of the saison that I brewed yesterday is up to at least F as high as the thermometer reads. So if  was ambient and you experienced a very vigorous ferment it is possible that you will have some off flavors for fermenting at too high a temperature.If the actual temperature in your fermentation vessel was F off flavors may still have developed if you underpitched. Did you make a starter?If your yeast cell count and fermentation temperatures were ok your beer will probably be fine in a few weeks.,Homebrewing,cqb9o3b,1,t5_2qj8u

Well I think its muddy!The traditional and well subscribed school of thought around rapid chilling follows what you and unicksuave have summarised well  precipitation of proteins and minimising DMS.Then along come hop stands...Hop stands happen after the boil and typically last between  and  minutes.  Temperatures range between C and C F  F depending on the desired result.So now we have a technique being widely used that leaves our wort sitting at a temperature where DMS will be produced potentially for quite some time.  Which flies in the face of conventional wisdom.My thoughts are the DMS production is offset by the significant hop aroma and flavour that the hop stand contributes to the beer.

The real question is what you are going to use for your controller. Are you planning on doing a gaselectric hybrid system? Like electric for the HLT with a HERMS coil and propane for the BK?

Im telling you it is not conducive to fitness in any way shape or form and can not be under any circumstances. Alcohol is going to hinder protein synthesis for one thing which is going to hurt any muscular gains you attempt to make as well.  gtPeople certainly can eat right reduce their calorie intake and still drink beer. Im simply trying to reduce the carbs as well. Why does that have your panties in a bunch?I never said you cant lose weight and also enjoy an occasional beer. But it is counter productive to do so. To suggest otherwise is also quite asinine. If you properly calorie restrict and drink beer you miss out on important macro nutrients. Beer isnt known for being a low calorie drink for a reason the low calorie examples are sub par beers. One of the primary ingredients is carbohydrates so naturally reducing that is going to make it generally less appetizing. gtDid you read the part about backsweetening with other alcohol sugars? Apparently not.I did and I dismissed it as a silly idea because while youll get sweetness that is all you will get. Likely artificial tasting sweetness that at worst will be cloying and at best just be meh. It may make up for some of the dryness but it isnt going to do anything whatsoever for the lack of beer flavor in the beer.Youre barking up a commercial brewing dreamland right now. Think about it If they could make a super low carb good beer theyd be raking in cash. It isnt that they havent tried there are examples that you even gave its that those are actually the best they have been able to do.Go for it. Give it a shot.

3960921,0,t3_35u27q,Ever since I got into homebrewing earlier this year one of the best things Ive noticed about homebrewers is their willingness to share with other fellow homebrewers.It all started with my girlfriends coworker.  I never knew the guy and have never met him.  All he knew about me was that I liked drinking different kinds of beers and has been wanting to learn how to make beer as told to him by my girlfriend.  Just with that randomly one day he came into work and gave my girlfriend  bottles of his pumpkin ale to give to me.  Id had an interest in homebrewing but never actually went through what it but this was what pushed me to finally start homebrewing.  Next instance was when I went to a lhbs to get a kettle pot.  It was towards the end of the workday and the employee was the only guy in the shop.  After I paid for the kettle pot we chatted a bit and then he asked if I had wanted to share a stout with him that was two weeks into bottle conditioning from a homebrewing class they held a few weeks back.  We ended up talking for a bit more and he showed me around the shop and answered the questions I had about homebrewing.In the picture I linked it isnt beer but wine.  My parents went to buy a chair from a guy in our town.  Upon chatting with the guy my parents learned that he was moving to Israel as he got a job as a winemaker there so he was selling his stuff.  My mom jokingly asked if he was a homebrewer because her son me homebrews beer.  He then leads my parents to his cellar and grabs a bottle the one in the picture and gifts it to my parents.  My dad and I drank some of it last night.  It was a really delicious red wine.  To all of you homebrewers cheers on being such generous and magnificent people.  ,Homebrewing,cr7s1a5,25,t5_2qj8u

At some point the pressure is reduced enough that it doesnt foam up too much.  You need to be careful when putting more gas into it other wise youll get another glass of foam.  After each glass I press the gas button two quick times and that keeps it carbonated but doesnt give you foamy glasses.

4226148,0,t1_cs1mwdb,gtNot sure why youd want to be pumping the wort around your chiller during the mash just seems like youd cool the mash down.Probably going to end up with a jacket around the bigger kettle to funnel heat from the burner up around the sides at the suggestion of one of the guys who will help me build this so it would actually pick up heat from the coil until I run cold water through it.gtAlso Id probably not permanently plumb in your CFC. Youre better off having it attach at the bottom to your drain valve and then Id just have a silicone hose running into the top rather than welding a fitting in for the liquid returnIt will sit on tabs to hold it to the outside of the kettle but not be permanently attached.gtYoull also probably still want a bag inside the grain basket to hold the grain. One of the good things about BIAB is that you have a very large surface area and also a very high open space ratio on the grain bag compared to a manifold in a mash tun. So youre better off with a basket with very large holesslits and then a grain bag.How much is enough I wonder.  A RIMS setup basically pulls through whatever the surface area of your false bottom is.  What Im thinking of would have a lot more open area than this for example.  If water is added at the top it should be forced to diffuse past the entire column of grains.For the deal at the top it seems like a cleaner solution to have a welded nipplebulkhead at the top so I could leave the lid on.  Inside would be some sort of removable spray bar to spread the liquid somewhat evenly around the top of the grain.You can buy stainless meshcloth down to a .mm opening.  I had planned on most of the bottom of the basket being mesh and some openings up the first couple inches of it.  Whatever I end up feeling leaves enough strength to lift it out to drain without it losing shape.Im not trying to shoot down input just understand it better and give my reasoning behind the different parts to see if my logic is wrong.,Homebrewing,cs1yi14,1,t5_2qj8u

Brewing classic styles is a great place to start for just pure recipe examples of various styles and style overviews.

Designing Great Beers also has a ton of great style guidelines and breaks down the ingredients in classic vs brewing competition entries. Basically in short you need knowledge and experience and a lot of that only comes with time and dedication. I had no clue how to design recipes a year ago. Now Im modifying recipes I find to my own tastes and coming up with new ones on my own and making intelligent choices on how I want the final beer to come out like. And pro tip Find a recipe you like and change things about it. This is the best way to see how ingredients change flavors. Change the hop to a new one youve never used. Increase or lower mash temp. Remove the crystal malt. Add a sugar. Change the yeast.

4383710,0,t1_csjpe4p,I havent decided yet. Back in November now I believe I got  gallons of fresh but blended cider direct from a farm. I pitched S in  gallons and used the Belle Saison in the other. My initial M.O. was to backsweeten the Belle with fruit and drink the S straight and really all for the celiac gf in the long run. The S took forever to ferment  like  months. The Saison ripped through it and dropped clear. So clear yeah its cider so different from wort that you can see completely through the  gallon carboy. Regardless upon tasting postferm the S tasted super dry while the Belle tasted like it still had some body to it  and I say tasted because Im pretty sure they were both at .. So I flipped my decision and backsweetened the S with a  oz container of POM juice I just added the whole thing when I kegged and used the overflow cider to braise some porkchops. Got it cold immediately so it wouldnt ferment again and weve been drinking it and Ive and her have been pretty happy. All that said the Belle is still sitting there with no definitive plan in mind she drinks so little compared to me! Im going to taste it again this weekend and hopefully move forward. Ive gotten a wild hair up my ass with some sour beer though so one of my thoughts was to use the cider as a guinea pig for some other fruit additions possibly splitting it off into gallon aliquots so I can determine how to fruit a bunch of lambicstyle beer I just brewed about a month ago.

The problem you run into is that many little homebrew supplies get repackaged into retail sizes by the LHBS or distributor carb drops Whirlfoc etc. and the instructions seem to be off when they print the new labels.If its not the amount of sugar another likely problem is that the caps are not holding a good seal for some reason usually technique or problem with the capper.If thats not the issue then could you have done something wrong in terms of yeast health or bottle conditioning temperature?,Homebrewing,csny4l1,1,t5_2qj8u

The change I made that has improved the beer out of sight was not chilling immediately.At flameout I threw in my last EKG addition and then left it to steep for about ten minutes.  The flavour is so much better.  The grassy offkilter aftertaste is gone replaced by the nice light floral earthy notes you would look for in an English bitter.I think what was happening in my early attempts was the rapid chilling immediately after flameout caused the  minute additions to behave more like dry hop additions.

4487531,0,t3_3cjdkq,This idea wont work. Your grain water will taste grainy and husky and you will add a bunch of starch to your beer. Besides creating haze it creates an ideal feast for unwanted microbes.Some of what you tell us about the beer is hard for me to make sense of. You say you got low efficiency after a stuck sparge. But if the beer is watery obviously your sparging ended up ultimately working fine maybe the issue was not a stuck sparge but poor lautering efficiency. Also if the beer is strong enough then it seems like maybe you hit your OG and perhaps efficiency is not an issue.If you could give us the grain bill process and OGFG wed have more info to help you decided whether it is better to just carbonate the beer or adulterate it first.FYI you can add maltodextrin to your beer at any stage of the beermaking process.

In terms of bottle over fermenter conditioning Im going with the fermenter as the yeast is still healthy and in larger numbers to clean up phenols and other possible off flavors over time.

Andor you can mash thinner.Second if you are batch sparging that braid ought to be OK although you may wish to coil up some nonreactive metal like stiff copper wire and put that in the braid to prevent it from getting crushed.Third if you are fly sparging you should build a manifold because you will otherwise suffer from channeling. See the addendix to How to Brew I forget which appendix for manifold design and theory.Finally If the issue is dead space to lift the wort to the level of the ball valve you are going to need a siphon and to have the siphon you would need to eliminate the holes in the copper pipe and it doesnt work real well with a manifold. For inspiration you might want to look at the design of mash tuns with false bottom and a intakesiphon tube that runs from the deepest part of the center under the false bottom to the valve in order to have an effective siphon.,Homebrewing,ctdn6t4,1,t5_2qj8u

But you will loose prob  gallons to trub loss.  and the needed head space.If you all primary with clean strains then you can add the different bugs in the barrel.  The brett will ferment what the clean strains couldnt which will produce co and clean it out.If you just want to use the blends in the carboy thats fine as well.  You can just add a couple lbs of dme or dextrose to make it bug exclusive to the barrel when you transfer.Over time the headspace will probably be more of a problem oxidation wise.All barrels breathe.

Like did you know they tested up flavour by serving people from cans of different shades of green? The darker the green the more lime flavour people reported and the yellower it got the more lemon they tasted. Thats fucking fascinating. Taste was changed in a significant way through color. I can understand the frustration in that but as makers of a food product I think its important to understand. If people consider clear beer to taste better well thats good to know. People dont taste in a variable controlled way they taste with all their senses. I fully think glassware alone could change taste perception significantly.Of course we should make the best objective product we can but we should also be fully cognizant of the psychology behind the final mile between how the final product is presented and served. ,Homebrewing,ctyhe83,1,t5_2qj8u

Stealing is stealing.  This is as black and white as issues come.  If I pick a millionaires pocket he might miss it less than would a guy who makes minimum wage but Im a thief either way.As you surely know kegs can often be salvaged for more than the deposit.  Obviously they cost more than the going salvage rate.  To pretend that paying a deposit means that you now own the keg  in light of the knowledge above  means willful ignorance at best and utter dishonesty at the heart of it.  Id really rather agree to disagree and drop this conversation.  I dont hold one whisper of a hope for changing your mind.  As Ive stated before youre going to do what you are going to do.

4808942,0,t1_cu0g9at,Well Munich extract is usually made with a portion of caramel malt for flavor and color which means you could reduce the Caramunich significantly. Also I see a reason to use pilsner malt when formulating an all grain recipe but for extract Id just use all Munich extract instead. The Pilsner extract will dilute the flavor and color and really only add fermentable sugars so if you want a malt flavor closer to an authentic rich complex oktoberfest all Munich is the way to go. This style may be the most difficult to accurately make using extract but this will get you close enough.,Homebrewing,cu0pgfs,1,t5_2qj8u

To make this easy if the box says the oats are flaked or rolled then you are good to just include them in the grist for yoru mash with no further steps except for two caveats see below because those types of oats are pregelatinized.If the oats are steel cut whole or some types of Irish oats you probably need to do a cereal mash. You can google this technique.Caveat  you may wish to add rice hulls or other hullshusks to the grist because oats are huskless and will make your mash sticky and difficult to lauter compared to grains with husks like barley.Caveat  if you go over  oats then consider a glucan rest at between F and  F for  minutes  that temp range is ideal for glucanase which will break down the gums aka beta glucans.

You also could probably stand more hops. Do a bittering addition at min maybe...Horizon or something similar and do the EKG at like min.  You may not need to coffee secondary if you punch up the roasted malts. At the end of the day you need enough sweetness to fend off the high alcohol and bitterness to keep the sweetness in check.

4945955,0,t1_cuhyrt3,There are two wheat varieties RedWhite and two seasons SummerWinter which each provide changes to the malt.  Realistically the White Wheat is perfectly fine as the Munich and specialty grains are providing most the flavor so a clean base malt is nice.  I havent experimented yet with using Red wheat just yet and might try something with it but I have a lot in the pipeline this year.For the rest yes and no need to pull grains unless your worried about scorching your bag.  A cheap Stainless Steel vegi steam tray without the center handle can counter this.  Temp wise with BIAB hitting lower and heating up is better than having to add water and cooling down.  So dont worry about undershooting temps and be careful of getting too warm.The smack pack comes with b cells which I believe is the same for the vial from White Labs.

A  point calibration is better than a  point calibration more points makes it more accurate but  can get it done.  Depending on how high tech your pH meter is there might be a calibration mode where you put the probe into the different solutions and your meter autocalibrates.  More than likely you have a simple one where you just put in in  then adjust a screw on the side to make sure it reads  then do it again for  or  or both.  Read your manual.Typically Ill mash in wait about  minutes then take a sample from the mash.  Cool it down and read the pH.  Then go from there with adjusting if needed.Clean it with tap water deionized water would be great but youll live.Store it so the probe is wet in a probe storage solution which you can buy online like this for example,Homebrewing,cvcnpid,2,t5_2qj8u

5207529,0,t1_cvd9fdr,Tannins can be extracted via temp but it is more of a combination of pH and temp than anything.  nonetheless anything above  I consider dangerous waters. there are so many things that can go on here that yeah I see what youre saying but if its detectable in the final product at least hell know what that astrigency is.As far as the starches amylose is water soluble at temp and amylopectin is kinda water soluble as well.  I have blown a batch up and completely ruined any starch conversion from the get go when I used our brewers pilot system for the first time and I ended up with a . beer that did not ferment at all.  I added amylase and it quickly started fermenting.  I might be wrong in remembering that but I feel pretty confident that a hydrometer can read off like that.

Once fermentation is done CO thus lost is not returned where would it come from?.

5331380,0,t1_cvt4upl,There are a million recipes to choose from online.  The big problem is knowing which ones are good and which ones arent.  The vast majority are just a recipe with no brewing notes no followup and no rating.HomeBrewTalk.com has quite a few tried and trusted recipes.  Just look for the most commented on ones for each style in their recipe section.  Generally those ones are very good.  After you have brewed a number of recipes in a particular style you will begin to develop a feel for what ingredients work and what quantities are appropriate.On the downside...  Unfortunately with HomebrewTalk recipes with a lot of comments about them get brewed more and more because they are popular.  And as a result garner even more comments.  Call it a snowball effect.  As a consequence other recipes may be very good dont get brewed much because they dont have lots of comments.

Im saying to ditch the crystal malt listed in the BYO recipe and lower the bittering value of the hops used.  You could use whatever hops you want.  Id also probably ditch the dextrose in your recipe and use flaked corn instead since thats pretty much a staple in American cream ales.  I would also consider using flaked barley for headbody instead of carapils but thats a personal preference.

At first there were still a lot of happy bubbles and it was chugging pretty strong. By the end of the day it settled down to just a few bubbles per minute and now on day  continues that way. The upper of my carboy is pretty sludgy from the gusher so I cant see well but besides some surface proteins or whatever theres no real krausen. Ive only had one brew before this one and dont recall exactly how quick I had a krausen or how long it lasted. The biggest difference from my first brew and this one is I rehydrated the yeast so I can only assume the yeast got to work pretty quick and built up waaay more pressure than my airlock could handle.

5543002,0,t1_cwjumzc,Im sad to see no responses because this is actually a pretty good issue to talk about. Does a  min ipa age well? I would think so with the high alcohol content and intense hopness. All that would meld nicely and mellow out over time. But I think the real debate is over the belief that IPAs should be drank fresh and super hoppy or drank how they were originally made. Basically aged in barrels over months. I assume common knowledge but just to reiterate IPAs started when hops were used in large amounts to save the beer on the voyage from GB to India. So not saying one would age and one wouldnt just that the Brewers may lean more to one belief than the other.,Homebrewing,cwk5sh1,3,t5_2qj8u

I would recommend not entering a session strength tripel there instead I think a C Experimental beer entry would help you get it judged as an actual session strength tripel and that way youd actually get meaningful feedback for the thing youre trying to create. like you wouldnt want the judge to tell you the aroma isnt hoppy enough because hoppy aroma isnt a part of tripels. but it is a part of a single. youd prefer them to expect a complex phenolic based aroma without the malty strength behind it and judge accordingly right? ,Homebrewing,cws7t8t,2,t5_2qj8u

When coming up with the optimal number of clusters for hierarchical clustering I found that number to be ... Thats to say anything more than  clusters is probably overfitting. You would probably need more than  clusters to have any kind of interesting narrative for the hops. Other clustering methods agreed with  clusters such as mixture models.This should also agree with our intuition... When exploring the  dimensional image there are no real obvious groupings present its more of a single continuum of hops. Perhaps that would change if more characteristics were considered!It may also interest you that I experimented with having the other oils as pure dissimilarity... but in the end I felt that was as inaccurate as saying that the other category could speak to hop similarity... so just excluded it in the end.,Homebrewing,cy019du,1,t5_2qj8u

Reddit discussion about microwaving starters which contains relevant linksReports vary between  seconds and  minutes. Either way its going to a much better approach than boiling with an open surface. FWIW I currently bring the media to a boil then transfer to a sanitized flask then nuke it for a minute so I use it in addition to boiling.

6389853,0,t1_czfugfz,Not really true.  I will agree that you dont get any significant hop character from bittering hops but bittering with lower alpha acid hops can lend more complexity and provide a slight vegetalgrassy note that high AA hops dont provide.  That being said will you notice that under the other hops?  Probably not but there are many lower IBU recipes that can benefit from a larger charge of low AA bittering hops for more control over your IBUs and more complexity from having the extra hop material in the boilI dont think you are wrong in this scenario for an agressively hopped beer but using only high AAs to bitter every beer would not be my choice.  ,Homebrewing,czfyksz,1,t5_2qj8u

Your cider is now stabilized. It is important that you do this before kegging because you want any errant sulphur to be able to escape through the airlock.Now figure how you much you want to backsweeten. A pound of sugar will give you about . gravity points. I typically use two pounds for a semi sweet cider. I would imagine that apple concentrate is about the same but maybe round down to .. Maybe use both sugar and apple concentrate.So add your backsweetening sugar and concentrate dissolve well and keg it. Its that simple. You can even add the sugarconcentrate at or around the time you add the campden and sorbate. The yeast probably wont catch on until the stabilizer kicks in and its too late.BTW the lack in apple flavor will be counteracted a bit by the sugar addition alone. A big part of what ppl perceive to be apple flavor is composed of sugar. The rest of it consists of an esoteric mix of various plant smells esters and tannins. Without the sugar apple doesnt really taste exactly like apple. That being said the apple concentrate will add a little more of that. Youll be good.Cheers.,Homebrewing,czvfh18,6,t5_2qj8u

6873396,0,t1_d0v0j31,I should note that candi syrup is much different since a lot of the common information on maillards and pH revolves around candi syrup production. Youre trying to get a huge amount of diverse and flavorful maillard products when making candi syrup and you have the ability to raise the pH very high in order to do so higher pH not only affects reaction rates but also the types of compounds and the reaction pathways. For those goals a pH in the low to mid s wouldnt be very good and would produce relatively few flavorful maillards so it depends on your frame of reference.

I spend a lot more time on rmead than I do over here and definitely spend a lot more time brewing that stuff. Partially because its easier but also because I dont like a lot of beers Though new roommate does so gonna have to brew him up some piss beer to see if he likes it more than his PBR.

So if I wanna see how X thing can affect flavors Oh such as brewing with molasses... I can do it in a relatively short time with only spending  usually mostly honey there though I can just sub sugar instead and drop the cost to the  price point.And thats including the costs of equipment to brew with Given that its just a jug of water or such and a balloon. Yes definitely not the best way to brew. So I use it to experiment myself before trying it with better equipment and better ingredients but I also use it to just show someone how its done from time to time and between those two things I can keep a few gallons of this stuff brewing at any given time while still having all the room in the world to brew good stuff with good equipment.,Homebrewing,d11j40c,1,t5_2qj8u

You just dont want the bag touching the bottom if you turn on your burner or itll scorch it and ruin your day and bag!.  The false bottom prevents the bag from touching the bottom of the kettle which is under direct heat from the burner.He doesnt really need a false bottom.  Not sure if youve watched what he does now but with brew in a bag BIAB which is one form of all grain brewing hed fill the kettle with water of a certain temperature dump in the bag dump in the grains stir and cover up everything in blankets to hold a certain temperature for an hour or so.  Then lift the bag squeeze it out and carry on as hes used to.I started with extract then moved to brew in a bag Ive got limited space so its nice to make what equipment Ive got dual use.  Keep in mind a bigger kettle is a requirement because grains  water take up more space.

6993639,0,t3_4bfpob,re BIAB Trust in the math.  Figure out your target water temp for dough in taking grain temp into account.  Youll be very close if not right on your target mash temp providing you work quickly enough doughing in and stirring.  I like this calculator You cant overinsulate your kettle.  I use a fleece blanket towels whatever I can find.  Remember to cover the ball valve and thermometer if you have them you can lose a few degrees alone through them if theyre exposed.  With a smaller thermal mass of a  gallon batch youll need extra to ensure it retains heat.  If youre mashing in another vessel like a cooler pour hot water in there and let it sit to get the vessels temp up otherwise itll absorb heat from your mash. Squeeze the bejeezus out of the bag.  Dont worry about tannin extraction Ive never heard of anyone having issues and chalked that myth up to oftrepeated dogma. If for some reason your mash temp goes screwy dont direct fire or direct heat if using a stove with the bag in there.  You might scorch the bag leading to shitty burnt flavours or worse rupture your bag.,Homebrewing,d192l88,1,t5_2qj8u

7005657,0,t1_d1adej1,Different yeasts have naturally different lag times.  Some just take longer.  If the wort is on the cooler side which is typically better than on the hot side it may take the yeast longer to wake up.  I would wait  or  days and take a gravity reading before adding more yeast.  I keep a couple gallons of star san in a home depot bucket and some in a spray bottle so it is ready when I need it.  It is important to use ROdistilled water to increase the solutions shelf life.  Brew day or bottling day I sanitize a bucket and store my sanitary stuff in there until I need to grab it.  Yea Ill squeeze the back if I need that extra bit of volume.  Typically I will sparge until I have enough wort.  Post boil could be bitter from the hops.  Is it possible you scorched your grains while trying to heat the mash?To maintain temp keep the lid covered if you are going to add heat try to do it ahead of time in short small burst instead of playing catch up and wrap it up in towels.  ,Homebrewing,d1afp6z,1,t5_2qj8u

I started adding more crystal malts different crystal malts and base grain all while taking meticulous tasting notes on each one. Then I used different bittering hops finishing hops and adding them at different times. Doing this really gave me a good perspective of what each change was doing.

Youd collect the yeast with a yeast ring a yeast log a piece of wood a cloth a straw ring ... and hang it up to dry. Some people would mix it with flour and turn it into a kind of cake.Today people seem to either collect it in a glass jar in the fridge or dry it on baking paper. Once its dried you can break it up and store it in the freezer. Ive done this and took pictures but havent had time to write up a blog post yet.I looked into this thing with reusing yeast. Obviously all yeast on the planet was reused until the autumn of  so that yeast can be reused should be obvious. Ive seen studies of some breweries that have been reusing their yeast x and the conclusion was that its not a problem.Sometimes the yeast will go bad though either because it mutates or because you have an infection. If you have a backup copy thats not a problem. Note that people who have their own yeast will taste either the yeast itself or the starter before using it precisely to avoid this problem.,Homebrewing,d2f9u97,18,t5_2qj8u

OG ..My girlfriend is hellbent on me making her a fruit beer and insisted on apricots.  I couldnt find any frozen apricots so I bought lbs organic dried apricot at Costcono sulfur preservatives or sugar added.  I boiled water and added them after letting it cool again to rehydrate.  Then I sanitized my blender and purreed the mix.  Then I vacuum sealed it in a package and put it in F water for  minutes.  Then I pulled the top of my primary fermenting .g batch of wheat beer and added the fruit by a funnel but it all wound up splashing in.  Fortunately it seemed there was positive C pressure in the carboy against the funnel as the edge of the funnel in the bunghole was bubbling up and exerting force against the funnel.  Did I really mess up by letting it all splash in?Then I decided I liked the taste of mosaic and dry hopped an ounce thinking it would complement the apricot.I brew by the seat of my pantsHow long should I let it sit before I keg it?  I want the fruit flavor but am now concerned about how long the beer is gonna sit on that mosaic dry hops.

7428500,0,t1_d2mk972,I agree that percarbonatebased cleansers are not sanitizers although you can get away with it on nonporous surfaces for a while or not because cleaning removes microbes  but does not kill any left over.Bleach is an interesting sanitizer. The name brand bleach doesnt always meet the standard for a contact sanitizer because of the washing soda they put in there that takes the pH into a higher range where the bleach has less killing power. You want to get the small bottle of generic bleach from the discount store generic has no washing soda and small means high turnover because bleach loses potency over time even if stored in brown plastic bottles. Then you want to make acidified bleach  gallon water   Tbsp. bleach gt mix very very well gt add  Tbsp. distilled white vinegar aka acetic acid. If you mess up the order of those steps you will make poison gas but its perfectly safe if you are not an idiot and can follow written steps. At that concentration it is a very effective sanitizer with minute contact time and many people would consider it to be norinse.

The ability to maintain a specific temp as well as cold crash and properly fine your beer will make the end product so much better that you wont feel bottling it is a burden at all especially if you cut down your workload by bottling in ml bottles andor screwtops. The other advantage is that youd need to spend less than  quid on a fridge and controller for fermentation while with kegging you need a heck of a lot of equipment on top of it. I reckon start with FC then think about getting your keg gear in order and when that happens you can start to dance with swapping the fermenter out and the keg in.

7739708,0,t3_4lbgb5,If you are going to use the yeast quickly like a matter of days then you can just store it in a container in the fridge until you use it.  But for long term storage this isnt recommended.  Once you open the packet you expose the yeast to oxygen and moisture.  Both of those things are bad as well as any potential contaminates.  One option for storage is sterile water.  Get yourself a few  oz or even  oz canning jars with metal lids.  Boil some water the jars and the lids on your stovetop for  minutes.  This removes excess oxygen and sterilizes everything.  With the jar filled to the brim with the freshly boiled hot water put on the cap and then let everything cool.  Put it into the fridge to get everything cold.You now have a few jars of sterile water which you can open up put your extra yeast into the water and seal it back up.  The yeast will settle down to the bottom over time and you can store it for months instead of days.  Fresher of course is better so use as soon as possible.  When it comes time to do your next batch you can decant the extra water and pitch your yeast.  edit  Or simpler still just pitch the whole jar of water into your brew.  If you have  oz jars it wont affect your beer even if you have a  gallon batch.,Homebrewing,d3ly5w0,5,t5_2qj8u

Pasteur has already proved that microbes cant get through a swan neck flask. They are not going to get through your blowoff tube either. If you are paranoid then make a loopdeloop in the tube and loosely ziptie the loop so it cant unwind. Now you can suspend the end of the blowoff tube above a large enough collection vessel so that if you ever get any suckback then the blowoff tube will never be immersed in liquid and you will just be sucking back air.I can also imagine a really complicated rig that involves among other things a tee with two check valves oriented in opposite directions.,Homebrewing,d42m6sc,2,t5_2qj8u

8134499,0,t3_4qlack,New brewer here just bottled my first batch on Tuesday. I have a couple questions regarding different issues. Because it might help with the second question it was an Amber ale extract that came with the northern brewer starter kit og was . and the fg was .. . I noticed some scratches in my fermenting bucket and bottling bucket. In the fermenter theyre light scratches Im assuming for stacking buckets. In my bottling bucket theyre similar but at the top there are some gouges maybe  mm deep. Maybe from storing equipment in them which Im obviously not going to do anymore. It seems as long as I rack below that line the wort wont come into contact with these deeper scratches. My main question is should these be a major concern? Ive read a decent amount of anecdotes from both sides and I feel I have a good sanitation process down  soak the buckets in some star san and before racking and still spray the entirety of the buckets in a good coating prior to transfer  so would it probably be in my best interest to replace? . Kind of a two part question. When I tasted the final product prior to carbonation I noticed a fruity off flavor. Im thinking it was more of the green apple nature but possibly banana but Im leaning towards the former. Im letting the bottles sit for at least two weeks but will try one next Tuesday. Will the bottle conditioning do anything to clean up the off flavors? Additionally I was using a swamp cooler a towel wrapped around the bucket slightly submerged in the water and a fan blowing over top of  that and I was replacing the frozen  water bottles twice a day. I kept this process going for the full two weeks and Im wondering if after the first week or so should I remove the bucket from the cooler? Im thinking the off flavor was from slightly stalling the yeast and not letting it do clean up duty. Also the packet of yeast was only . grams I think which I rehydrated  yeast got down to  and the wort got down to . Seemed like a low amount of yeast but it wasnt a big recipe. My set up is in my cement floored back room in my basement where the ambient air temperature is roughly  degrees. . Upgrades. Initially I was going to get a new fermenter because Id like to see whats going on but its not really going to make better beer. I was thinking about getting a sp propane burner because my electric stove took a ridiculous amount of time to reach  for the steeping grains and a ridiculous amount of time to get to a boil. Then after adding the lme the wort could never get a rolling boil afterwards and only got up to around  went into a rolling boil after adding hops though. The other purchase I was considering as well is a chiller because that seems  like it could have a direct effect on the beer.. Blow off for a bucket. I would prefer to use a three piece airlock and add tubing to it whats the best way to go about thiswhat size tubing should I get? Or if someone has a nb bucket what size tubing have you found fits best in the grommet?Sorry for the long wall of text but this is something I could see myself doing for a while and have been wanting to do for the past five years.

8182042,0,t3_4rda3l,Spunding at the commercial level is done in the Conical when a specific attenuation is reached prior to the expected terminal gravity. Before capping and spunding trubyeast dumping from the cone is completed. Some yeast strains are more pressure tolerant than others so if you are going to finish fermentation under pressure by spunding you will want to be a little conservative initially or it may stall fermentation. It can also have a negative impact on the next batch if you are reusing your yeast.In the Brewery after TG is reached another yeast dump is done before the finished beer is transferred to the bright tank for further carbonation and conditioning. In your case you will not be able to dump yeast a second time since youre finishing the ferment in the keg. The drawback I see here is that after TG is reached and yeast flocculates you may get a noticeable yeast cake on the bottom of your keg and your beer will not pour as clear. ,Homebrewing,d50azy6,2,t5_2qj8u

If your wort is already sour then you might slow down the Sacch and Brett in there might be slowed down. So if you can ride it out you might as well let it go. If youre really eager to get it done then you might just move it back to a kettle to boil again and then repitch with a clean strain. Im not certain but Id guess it would volatilize a lot of the sulfides but if your yeast got to work youll boil off a lot of alcohol too.

Yet in that sense its like a pool table or pinball machine something not everyone has but is a fun thing to enjoy when over at someone elses house and thus a toy with social advantages. Add a Perlick SS tap or a CM Becker inline flow controller to finetune the flow rate and reduce the foam and its a dream come true.Edited added more thoughts,Homebrewing,d59spqa,2,t5_2qj8u

I usually empty out the bleach soaked carboy as the wort is chilling.

They should have fairly low IBUs and very little aroma in accordance w most wheat styles.You are correct to ignore those instructions.  Those are for the everpopular kit and kilo type brews.  Very populare amonst malt extract manufacturers for the ease with which they can be brewed but produce watery subpar beers.Another question is how much LME is in those cans?  Is it close to the amount suggested in the recipe?If not I would probably recommend just scaling down the recipe a bit to keep the same LMEwater ratio.  Otherwise your beer may come out a bit weak or watery.On record keeping in addition to all the points you have gravity might be interesting but its a bit fiddly  unnecessary w all extract brews.  It can be very hard to get the wort mixed w the topup water sufficiently  assuming you arent doing full boils and calculating it out from the weight of extract and volume of water used is pretty foolproof.

Adding it to the bottle would cause the bottle to carbonate differently possibly creating bottle bombs.   Id be tempted to either rack to another carboy and add it there as a secondary with fruit for a while or bottle some of the beer then add the fruit to the original carboy letting it ferment for a while there as well.

I would wager that in most cases youd be correct but this is largely dependent on the strain of yeast. If its a more finicky strain you may stress them and get some off flavors or even outright stall fermentation. Second week I find is mostly cleanup and conditioning so if it stalls you may end up with more acetaldehyde than you would like. ,Homebrewing,d6mrhxh,2,t5_2qj8u

I would use a carboy and cover the opening with very fine mesh tied around with an elastic band if youre dead set on open fermentation.Im of the opinion that open fermenters are known for producing more esters because most of them are square shaped and have corners which reduce circulation during fermentation. I think the shape of the fermenter has considerably more to do with it than the pressure on the fermenter. Especially the negligible amount from an airlock. Imagine how much pressure difference there is between the inside of a  gallon batch and a  barrel batch. If anything you should be adding pressure.,Homebrewing,d6o8o0d,1,t5_2qj8u

8714276,0,t1_d6u35vq,Apologies in advance for the wall of text Im not a writer and Im a shitty story teller...Back in  when I had already been in IT for  years my department was outsourced.  That was a good high paying job and I was on the management track in a Fortune  company.  As you know just a little bit before then the economy crashed.  I felt like I had the rug pulled out from under me and nobody in town was hiring.I had an AAS certs and experience but I found myself working short term contracts with about a  pay cut from what I was making I then found something a bit more stable an  month contract.  During that contract I became very disillusioned with my situation and with IT in general.  As that  month contract was coming up my wife and I made several changes to our lifestyle and household budget.  That contract ended in January of  and I wound up taking  months off of work.That was the best  months of my life! I spent everyday with my kids and I was able to get a ton of stuff done around the house while they were at school.  During that summer the kids and I were able to go to our local pool nearly everyday and we traveled to visit family quite often neither my wife nor I had any family closer than  hours away.  Sure our money was tight but things were nice. I was putting my resum out there the whole time but again no one was hiring.But come August I had a managed services company reach out to me.  I interviewed and got the job.  The company was based out of state and I was supporting a client here in town.  I was the only employee for my company here in the state and I was spending hours every day just going from one of my clients sites to the other they were a car dealer ownership group.  Desktops servers switches routers bridges it didnt matter if hands need to be layed on it I was the guy. I was on call .  If I wanted to go and do something on a weekend I had to get it cleared with my boss ahead of time.  I had to keep my company phone on me all the time and respond every time it went off.  I was working with car salesman every day.  Ill apologize ahead of time if I offend anyone but many car salesmen are pieces of shit.  I understand its a high pressure environment and theyre under a lot of stress but Jesus guys lighten up.So here I am  years old in a job that I hate working for people that I cant stand and I was just. fucking. done. with it.Id always wanted to work for myself and my k had actually started to rebound from the huge hit it took in .  So what do I love?  Beer and homebrewing. So I started putting together a business plan and looking for a location.The location was actually the hardest part for me.  Trying to find something that was big enough easy to find and that I could afford. One day my wife and I were driving down the road and we passed this log cabin with a for salelease sign.  My wife told me to call and I said no theyre going to want way more than I can afford to pay for that.  I kept looking for someplace I could lease and I just wasnt finding anything that I was happy with.  Again my wife and I were out driving and we passed that log cabin and again she told me I should call.  We stopped and I wrote down the phone number just to make her happy.  And then she kept asking me Have you called them yet about that cabin? Over and over she would ask me.  No I havent Ill never be able to afford that. well you should call them just to see.Fine Ill call them.I called and arranged to do a walk though. And you know what as soon as I walked in I knew this was the place.  It was just so fucking perfect.  I mean a log cabin and a homebrew store? In the Blue Ridge Mountains? How could you go wrong with that combination?And turns out it was actually affordable.This was somewhere around November of . Now I kicked it in to high gear.  I started getting really serious with the business plan reaching out to wholesalers the local homebrew club... doing as much research as I could.The first week of January  I cashed out my k.  It wasnt a whole lot but I thought it could get me through the first year.  I was negotiating with the cabin owner and we finally settled on a lease.  I was to sign and take occupancy on January st a Saturday.  On the th I called my manager and gave my two weeks notice.  They immediately cut me.  I didnt give a shit.  I was sooo happy.I woke up Saturday morning and I had an email from the owner of the MSP I was working for letting me know that they had planned on cutting me the following Monday anyway.  The client didnt like having to go through the MSP for local support and wanted to hire their own local technician.  I had a noncompete with the MSP and couldnt be hired directly by the client for two years after the end of my employement not that I would have anyway. So they cut me.I didnt give a shit.  I was happy.I went to meet the realtor and take possession of the cabin.I was blissful... I was making my dream come true.We opened our doors on March nd.  It was a sunny beautiful day for March.  I had tons of friends come out to support me and the day just flew by.  Some of my friends were brewing out in the parking lot and we had customers all day long.  I was ecstatic this is exactly how its supposed to happen.The next day was dead.  I mean dead dead.  I honestly cant remember if anybody walked in the door that day.  And it was slow for weeks after that.  But slowly word started to get out and we started building a base.By that July I actually turned a small profit.  Every dime that came in got reinvested in the store.  I increased our inventory I expanded our selection.  Not a dime went in my pocket.  And we kept growing.Now this isnt to say we didnt have slow days or weeks even.  But by Christmas things were actually going really well.  A few months ago I even started paying myself a little bit not much enough to cover a car payment but something.Since Ive opened the shop Ive gotten to know a ton of really great people Ive gotten to brew a couple of times on a brewerys pilot system and this weekend Ill be a judge at our Deschutes Street Pub!Was this the right decision for me?  Yes undoubtedly.  Were fortunate in that my wife has a good job and weve been leaning on her a whole bunch for the last year and half.  Ive also missed a ton of my kids sports and school events.  But things are getting better and last week I closed the store and we went to the beach down in Georgia for a week.Im not sure this is for everyone though. A few months ago I had a young guy come in to buy ingredients for his recipe.  We got to talking and he said that he wanted to open his own business one day.  I said thats great and we talked a bit more about it and then he asked What if it doesnt work out?.I was taken aback. What if it doesnt work out?  What kind of question is that?  I told him that I didnt have a plan for failure.  It has to work there is no alternative for me. I didnt go into this planning for failure.  If it looks like Im heading down that road then Ill plan for it when the time comes.  As it is Id like to be able to hire someone soon. Id like to be able to spend a little more time with my family.  Im planning for success thats what Im planning for.So you want to walk away from it all and do your own thing?  Thats awesome and I encourage you to do it but make sure youre prepared. There will be sacrifices along the way.  You will have to tighten your belt.  There will be times when you wont see your family.  Be prepared to work.  And you have to work you cant just show up and collect a paycheck. And dont you dare ever get comfortable... because theres always someone else with a dream too. TLDR Fuck it damn the man.  Do your own thing and make your own success because nobody else is going to do it for you.And congrats you just read the longest post Ive ever typed up...,Homebrewing,d6ux7gc,5,t5_2qj8u

8731102,0,t3_4zkwo6,I usually bend my dip tubes so they arent all the way at the bottom of the keg. That way they are above the sediment and are less likely to pull it from the bottom. If you havent bent your dip tube you could be getting sediment that hasnt fully settled at the bottom. Disturbing the keg can also send the sediment down to the dip tube if it is at the lowest point in the keg.Ive also had gelatin take a few extra days to clear a beer so a little more time may clear things up for you. But do remember that shaking the keg or moving it at all will probably stir up the sediment at the bottom and give you some cloudy beers. Some people transfer to another keg after clarifying with gelatin so they can have a clear beer without the worry of disturbing sediment.,Homebrewing,d6x17i5,1,t5_2qj8u

8756018,0,t3_4zzp62,Over the course of three attempts all you did was change the recipe. Try changing your processes. I suggest you stop whirlpooling for an hour at a temperature that is dangerously close to the environment in which bacteria thrive. If you feel the need to chill your wort before adding whirlpool hops try keeping it between F. If youre against any alpha acid isomerization in the whirlpool chill to F. Cut the whirlpool time back from  minutes to  minutes and assess the results. Between the time it takes you to cool the wort and the  minute whirlpool youve successfully produced a very noticeable amount of DMS. Also leave the lid off during whirlpool. Compounds are still evaporating even at F collecting on the inside of your lid and dripping back down into solution.Rapidly cooling your wort after boiling is also important. The SMM to DMS conversion continues at temperatures well below boiling so DMS is produced even while the wort is cooling after the boil. However unlike the mash DMS produced while cooling cannot be boiled off. This conversion continues even if the hot wort is vented. For every hour you have hot wort sitting around you will produce approximately a  increase in DMS.  BeersmithI believe you have a DMS problem my friend. Change your process and reassess the situation. Also I dont know what size batches you brew but if its  gallons you might be getting a slight vegetal character from such massive hop additions.

8798096,0,t3_50navs,Fresh hops are usually about  water so a weight conversion factor of to fresh to dried is a good rule of thumb. Wet hops are best for aromaflavor additions so on brewing day I would recommend using dry hopspellets for your bittering addition and save your fresh hops for lateflameout additions. Just keep in mind that there will be a lot of them! Make sure your kettle has room for the large volume of hops. That being said because the hops are wet they will not absorb the wort so if you adjust your boil volumes for a large amounts of hops thats not necessary when wet hopping aside from any for your bittering hops.For the dry hop portion you dont need to dry them  just throw them in fresh with the same weight conversion as in the boil. This can be hard logistically because you are generally going to need your dry hops at least a week after the boil and you dont want to pick the hops and try to keep them in the fridgefreezer for more than a couple days. So if all of your hops are ready at the same time you should dry the portion that you are going to dry hop with just so theyll keep. Sometimes though and this happened to me this year different plants become ready for harvest over a couple of weeks so you can do one partial harvest for the brewing and then another a week or two later for the dry hops.,Homebrewing,d75et0w,3,t5_2qj8u

9074748,0,t3_54k8kp,You can buy a replacement bung for a mini keg at homebrew supply stores including Midwest Supplies. If you pull out the little faucet and replace it with the replacement bung then you can tightly fit any half inch outer diameter tubing into the bung. A stainless steel racking cane would be perfect for this if you buy the right size. From there you can decide in which orientation to keep the mini keg whether and where to cut off any band in the racking cane whether and how to bend your liquid tube inside the mini keg and how to connect your line to both your liquid tube and your hand pump fitting.Edit The real issue with using mini kegs that are commercially purchased is that you want to avoid buying one that has a CO or nitrogen bubbler widget that is glued inside. There is no way to sanitize that. Furthermore because you cant see inside the mini keg and the lining inside is fragile they recommend that five should be the maximum number of uses. You are probably better off either buying a new mini keg Midwest supplies also carries those or buying one that is known not to have the gas widget such as Bittburger or Bells.

9121075,0,t3_556o97,Ive brewed with Pineapple a lot. One thing you have to keep in mind is Pineapple chunks will absorb a good bit of your wort. My advice would be to use Pineapple juice instead. Trader Joes and dole brand both have  juice not from concentrate. A half gallon of Pineapple juice is plenty for any  gallon batch. Even at that rate the Pineapple juice will mostly ferment out and youll wind up with a tart beer not truly sour but definitely tart. Another option would be to use zythos hops because they instill a wonderful Pineapple aroma without being overpowering. If you want a hoppier Pineapple beer try dry hopping with them and maybe a little Citra for good measure.Your final option imo is Pineapple extract. I bought some from olivenation.com awhile back. mL in a  gallon batch is more than enough but it definitely has an almost artificial flavor to it at that concentration.As for your base recipe Ive tried wheat Ales pale Ales smashes and even an amber. My suggestion is something basic like thisgal all grain row enough to adjust your abv to whatever level you want. white wheat malt honey malt. golden naked oatsoz zythos  minoz zythos  minoz Citra  min .gal Pineapple juice  minHope that helps!,Homebrewing,d887d7s,5,t5_2qj8u

Damaging the husks can lead to tannin extraction which causes astringency but also the intact husks are instrumental in lautering.If you are talking about a very small amount of grains such as in an extractsteeping grains I would consider just crushing the grains in a plastic bag or pillowcase with a rolling pin or other hard flat implement. Some people put it in a couple pillowcases or one pillow case under a tarp and drive over it with a car.If this is more grain that you want to crush manually and its a true partial mash kit then its up to you to decide the the grain portion is significant enough in the context of the extract portion to warrant worrying about tannins and whether you can lauter the mash.

9719644,0,t1_dab0b1e,This is all wrong. Sorry. The moment your beer goes into the bottling bucket its staling and we all hope to measure your time to completion of bottling in minutes not even hours much less days. I fell asleep once calculating priming sugar and left the beer in the bucket for a  hours and it had noticeable offflavors from that.gt  had actually itended to transfer my beer to the bottling bucket last night let it sit for a day and bottle today but we tried to be ambitious and bottle last night. This is a way to imbue wet cardboard flavor into your beer due to oxidation as well as turn the malt character all caramellike and make the hops disappear. Sorry to be harsh but this idea is just so wrong.gt Decided to hold off bottling until today in the hopes some of it settles. I dont need to beat the dead horse here.gt will I have any issues due to the priming sugar sitting in the botttling bucket for  hours?Yes because its not like you can ask your yeast if they will kindly take a break until you give them a signal to commence again. That sugar is being fermented as I type and now you dont know what your carbonation level will be when you bottle nor do you know how much sugar to add to compensate.gt Also how the hell do you guys get autosiphons to work without bringing over tons of sediment?Start by not bottling cloudyhazy beer. Wait for it to drop clear and you can accelerate the process by cold crashing and gelatin fining as others mentioned. Rack from the top of the beer and lower the tip of the autosiphon as the beer level drops  this requires great vigilance because sucking up air will oxidize your beer and dropping it too low will suck up sediment. HERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART if youre greedy and try to get every ounce of beer then you will get sediment. Losing beer at every stage is a fact of life in brewing which is why most custom recipes are designed for odd sizes like . gallons.gt I definitely transferred most of the trub from the boil vessel to the fermenter after boil.Thats perfectly fine. Its the next stage where you need to rack carefully.So in terms of usable advice for next time bottle when the beer is clear. You can speed the clearing process. Rack carefully and leave some beer and all the sediment behind. Bottle it all in one shot the whole process at once. Move with deliberate speed. Good luck!,Homebrewing,dab5oei,3,t5_2qj8u

The way that English breweries swapped yeasts it doesnt surprise me that many ended up with multistrains and that some of the individual strains in those cultures ended up in other breweries and perhaps at Carlsberg for Carnegie Porter and then at Sinebrychoff.  In fact Sinebrychoff is owned by Carlsberg. Ive never had Sinebrychoff TBH so I cant comment on whether that part about Wyeast  is true. But back to real Ringwood vs. Wyeast . Ringwood at least what Ive tasted from Alan Pughsley breweries has that distinct Ringwood flavor.  is the yeast that so many American brew pubs loved despite what Wyeast says about the yeast now because if you pitched active cultures from fermentor to fermentor it fermented quick gave distinct and unique English but not Ringwood flavor and dropped like a rock. You had to manage fermentation to avoid diacetyl but it was a great yeast for brew pubs back when there werent tons of great yeasts available because you could go from grain to glass in a week and skip a week in the conditioning tank. IME Im able to get these consistent and fast fermentations if I pitch a kraeusening starter and raise the temp on day . If you ferment it cool it will chug along very slowly but fairly cleanly and thats how I could see if being used in a Baltic Porter. In fact I should try that.Would love to your further thoughts.

10045280,0,t1_dbgsnch,gt I can see several ways of going about this including brewing to very high SG and cutting with water No this wont work unless you use only the first runnings and make multiple worts to fill the fermentor. Your extraction efficiency is related to how many units of wort you collect per unit of grain. If you collect  gal of wort for a  gal batch you need to double the grain bill and collect  gal of wort for the  gal batch or suffer a loss of efficiency. Making a  gal batch on  gal equipment could lead to  efficiency as one user earlier today posted about.gt ... perhaps augmenting with LMEYeah partial mash is a good solution. Mash the specialty malts and a little less than half the base malt. Pay attention to how this changes your water chemistry. Then replace the rest of the base malt with a matching DME or LME.gt running multiple identical batches into the fermenterAmericans call this double batch brewing and the Germans Drauflossen. Its a standard technique in commercial breweries. You can enhance this by pitching the first brew half the batch on day one and then adding the second brew on day two or three thereby making it easier for you to have enough yeast for such a large batch without making a L starter. You second brew could be the DME batch using the partial mash method.gt running a base malt batch that is designed to be quick then a second batch that has all the fancy malts adjuncts and hops which would shorten the brew day compared to two batches back to backThis is a bad idea unless the second brew is a DMELME batch. The full onehour boil is important for allgrain brewing most styles of beer for coagulation of protein isomeraization of hops color and flavor in many cases and other reasons.Personally I think double batch brewing is what I would choose for my setup if I needed to make  gals.Typo its Drauflossen.,Homebrewing,dbgxc4d,4,t5_2qj8u

Genral tips I have I switched a few months ago to a  gallon pot and I highly recommend it.  get a refractometer for measuring your gravity to avoid losing a bunch of beer every time you sample. Youll have to use a calculator to adjust your reading once fermentation has started but its manageable. People have said refractometers have issues with dark wort and hoppy beers  but my refractometer consistently matches what my hydrometer reads in these cases so YMMV you can easily do stove top mashes but you may have to get creative with managing the extra space of your brew pot since theyre usually standardized to larger pots for recipes i just scale recipes i find based on batch size. I use Brewing Classic Styles unless Im trying to make my own recipe but I believe Speed Brewing has some  gallon batch recipes.

However there are those who think anything without  IBU and a big dry hop charge is bland. If you dont like American Ambers then yeah you might want to dry hop it. Its your beer so do what you want. Typically youd add  oz of dry hops per  gallons and youll get maximum extraction after two days at room temp. If you dry hop longer at some point youll start extracting unpleasant flavors.

Rack to a secondary and let it settle for a couple months.  Basically the clearer the cider is when it goes in the bottle the less dregs youll have in the bottle.  As long as youre not running through a filter there will still be enough yeast to carbonate.  But youre still going to have some amount of sediment.

A hydrometer would also be useful so you know how strong the beer is and when it has finished fermenting.You can buy a punk IPA kit from brewdog but I believe you need a large  litre pot for the boil. I went straight into all grain so cant help you much more.If you buy the tiny rebel kit you will see that it comes with pellet hops so yes you could easily buy more hops and add them after fermentation dry hopping.

10195831,0,t1_dbz5e7b,Buckets prosCheap easy to use easy to clean doesnt weigh a ton. All around a lot more practical.Carboys cons See above. Carboys are simply very impractical compared to buckets if you need to move them around which inevitably happens. There are some ways to get around this keeping them in crates or harnesses to make them easier to move. Still heavy though and theyre still a bitch to clean.Buckets cons Theyre made of plastic which means that scratches are going to accumulate over the course of their life. Scratches are pockets where you cant sterilise and that means increasing risk of infection with time. For this reason you need to buy new buckets every now and then but then they are cheap. If you ever use bacteria like Brett or have an infection you may safely assume that you are never going to able to remove that from plastic which is why you need a separate set of plastic equipment for sour beers this means separate siphon and bottlefiller too!. Theyre made of plastic which means that they are somewhat permeable to oxygen which glass isnt. This is completely irrelevant for short fermentation times of a month or less i.e. the vast majority of situations but it becomes a factor in bulk aging. Sour beers like lambic are especially sensitive to this as too much oxygen will make them take on a taste of vinegar while aging is at the same time appropriate for many styles. A lambic sitting in a plastic bucket for a year or more may easily taste like vinegar which isnt a fun discovery. A barley wine or imperial stout sitting in plastic for several months might be more oxidised than youd like and so on. Buckets have much larger headspace in terms of surface than carboys which also ties in to nr.  above meaning more surface towards the potential air in the headspace. Theoretically CO is heavier than air and oxygen so it should push everything else out of the headspace during primary fermentation but reality is seldom so black and white. As long as you dont move your buckets too much this shouldnt be a problem but it may be another reason you dont want buckets for extended aging.Carboys pros Great for extended aging of lambics meads barley wines and so on.Conclusion Theres never any reason to do primary fermentation in a carboy thats just unnecessary hassle. If you ever make something that will require many months of aging you should get a carboy and transfer your brew to that for secondary fermentation. If you dont make beers or meads like that youll never need a carboy. Youll just need to get new buckets every once in a while when they become too scratchy and remember to keep separate buckets for sour culture.,Homebrewing,dbzr53z,2,t5_2qj8u

If I had the ability to go back to Germany and grab some water from the town I stayed in I  would. So Im OK with not conforming to the Reinheitsgebot in a few places. This is one of them Id rather have German water than the shit water Ive got here.Same with the CO. I get its an added ingredient but I dont think Im going to get a spunding valve in order to save the CO.

If not you should do that first.Ive made several beers with between  oat malt.Fawcett Oat Malt is diastatic. I ran a series of test mashes but later was told my methodology was flawed. Neverthless when I rerun the series I am sure that it will confirm my results that the diastatic power is sufficient to convert itself barely similar to a L Munich.In the  beer the oats are fruity berry and with a grainy characteristic that is almost sweet and reminiscent of steel cut oatmeal porridge and cheerios cereal if you get it. Thats to my palate. Mouthfeel is fullbodied silky and some said slick I shipped and shared a  oats beer with  friends including usufferingcubsfan but not all bottles carbed reliably so Im not confident on the feedback. I recommend a step mash for a  oatmeal beer glucan rest  Hochhurz.Milling requires a narrow mill gap and no rice hulls are needed due to the high husk content. Extract  was  on my test mashes I was not compliant with ASBC or EBC specs for congress mashing. I dont have valid results for modification.Im possibly going to get my hands on some locally picomalted oats in exchange for testing so well see if anyone can replicate Klose et al.s results I havent been able to.In terms of hops Ive only used Challenger for bittering and EKG or Northdown for other hopping so far IIRC. Im not as interested in the beer results as I am in the process so Ive spent way more time proceeding incrementally than just jumping into brewing beer.You should totally do some pilot batches and feel free to share info with me and Ill be happy to share my thoughts on those and any new results I have in the meantime.,Homebrewing,dcq0276,8,t5_2qj8u

10550908,0,t1_dd3waki,No lactic acid production is sugar gt acid unlike acetic acid production which is alcohol gt acid. It doesnt take much residual gravity to sour a beer a little. You can always add some dregs or vials of mixed culture and let it work itself down and see how you think the flavour profile is.You can add some maltodextrin at the same time to bump up the available food source or after a while if you dont think it got sour andor funky enough. Maltodextrin is long chain polysaccharides that microbes like Brettanomyces and Pediococcus can metabolise but Saccharomyces cannot. Pedio can handle longer chains thank most Brett species too so even if Brett eats some there will be plenty left for Pedio to create lactic acid.If you choose to add Pedio then youll likely want to add Brett as well Pedio likes to produce diacetyl and the Brett will clean it up for you.,Homebrewing,dd42b8n,2,t5_2qj8u

My gut feeling is no and it seems to be an easy infection vector.My first batch was a SMaSH kit. I tasted some leftover from bottling and I thought it was great.  weeks later I crack open a bottle and there is a much boozier flavor.

Here is a fairly comprehensive post and thread that covers how to make good IPAsgt am wondering if this practise is having a negative impact on my beers? I think that the commercial brewers certainly believe that having very low levels of dissolved oxygen is critical to hop flavoraroma with many shooting for the low sometimes singledigit ppg levels of dissolved oxygen.gt I really dont want to change from my stainless pots as keeping them clean and sanitised is a breeze.There are other ways to ferment in easytoclean vessels. For example you can get a SS conical fermentor or SS fementation bucket with a sealing lid. You can ferment in kegs make slightly smaller batches in corny kegs split into tw kegs buy  or gal cornys or use sanke kegs.

10846523,0,t1_ddynx4y,The saison strains can produce some tartness but it could be something wild.  Yeasts will not really produce acid on their own.  Lactic or acetic acid bacteria would which both look different than yeast under a microscope. You could send it to a lab and have it analyzed. You could buy a microscope and look at the dregs of one of your bottles assuming you threw away the cake on the bottom of the fermenter.

I was thinking along different lines  a greater dilution TBH like  or more dilute so your current sour is the inoculant for future batches. Kraeusening probably cant hurt other than prolonging the time to stable gravity and maybe giving the funkier microbes that are dominant now more of a chance now that viable Sacch levels are maybe lower than at initial pitching.However if youre going for a mixed culture fermentation you also have to consider whether adding any highIBU beer would be detrimental right?

No need for a secondary unless you are doing some sort of second yeast pitch or adding additional fruits or flavors or such.

Is there a difference in the composition of the two grains that matter rather than the total protein? I found some info the other day that raw wheat like oats and raw barley has significantly more Bglucan than their malted varieties and so will contribute to body as well and am curious if Bglucan really is the key. ,Homebrewing,deakhko,1,t5_2qj8u

10972547,0,t1_debq96h,That sounds delicious. usufferingcubsfan has been chasing toffee character for a bit.  My personal take on itUse something like C or Carastan probably dont need a ton and then use just a little bit of vanilla at packaging. A few home made recipes I see for toffee use some vanilla and vanilla really acts like salt in this case. A small amount will help bring out other flavors you dont want it to be too if at all noticeable. Something ubrouwerijchugach had suggested was possibly making a toffeelike sugar out of lactose. Not sure how adding butter to the boil will go though. The vanilla will help bring out chocolate character as well. ,Homebrewing,debqomv,3,t5_2qj8u

Now Ive used heavier percentages of crystal malts in my aged sours but typically do not in kettle soured beers. In an aged sour over time the added dextrines from the crystal malts will be consumed by the brett and or microbes however in a kettle soured beer much of those dextrines or sugars not readily fermented by saccharomyces brewers yeast are leftover nor are they biotransformed during aging into more pleasing flavors.To summarize my educated guess is that it is the  of the Crystal L that is causing the raisin flavors. The bitterness Im not so sure the hopping schedule doesnt seem extreme. It might be a combination of the hop flavors meshing with the latent sugars of the crystal malts.,Homebrewing,delt2p8,2,t5_2qj8u

You can make up for your low efficiency in future batches by adding less than  in base malt to your grain bill. Not to say its not worth looking into increasing it however.Second You didnt mess up too bad by adding c of sugar to a  gal batch?. It will dry your beer our just a little bit but not to the point where it will be dry white wine. This is because table sugar will fully ferment out. Your beer may have turned out cloying due to mashing too high  was that the case for you? Did you have trouble controlling the mash temperature?Its pretty hard to overpitch a  gallon batch without an enormous starter. That wouldnt produce a cloyingly sweet beer though.

11462739,0,t3_63l2ja,I like to have everything ready the night before Im going to brew.  I measure out the water and also the sparge water if im going to spagre.  To that note you can save some time by doing no sparge it looks like you BIAB so maybe you do this already?  The ingredients dont really need to be lined up and measured out I do that when the strike water is warming or during the mash.  You can also get away with doing shorter mashes to shave off some time even as quick as  minute mashes.  I also clean while I brew so after collecting the wort from the mashtun I clean out my mash tun and set it aside to dry while the beer is coming to a boil be careful pay attention so you dont have a boil over.  I also try and save time by not chilling all the way just down to  degrees or so and then putting the fermenter in my ferm chamber to come down to temp the rest of the way.  Ive started doing Vitality starters so this works out well usually.  I can use real wort collected from the mashtun to make my vitality starter then pitch it later when my wort has come down to temp in the fermenter chamber.For quality It depends on your normal process.  Do you make yeast starters?  If not are you pitching enough yeast? Get that under control.  Are you controlling fermentation temperature?  If not start.  Next step after those two start looking at your water profile.  get your PH in check.  Keep good notes on brew day!  If you were short a half gallon of water write it down so the next time you get the right amount of water in there!  These things all seem small until you add them all up consistency starts to make better beers if you have too many variables that arent controlled then its hard to pin point what is going wrong or what went wrong with that one batch.,Homebrewing,dfvalui,2,t5_2qj8u

I would recommend always checking Original Gravity and Final Gravity with a hydrometer if you dont have one get one theyre reasonably priced.If that doesnt solve your issue try doing a forced ferment test on your next batch.  When transferring to your fermenter put some of the wort in a seperate container an empty gatorade bottle for example.  Pitch one full packet of dried yeast into it and stick it somewhere warm.  It should ferment out fast.  Test the Final Gravity of the sample then compare it to the Final Gravity in your main fermenter after it finishes fermenting.

11670916,0,t1_dgiwi7v,Good to know! Is a wierd situation. If you extract the oils. It kills the head retention. And usually the heat from the boil will transfer the good stuff into the wort if you added it as  a a boil addition buts a fat soluble chemical and beer well isnt fatty. Itll remain but potencyefficiency will be lack luster. If it stuck to proteins that would be much easier and would be much more effective. Maybe butter beer?

You could have left a oz bottle on the floor of the truck you borrowed from your father in law.I came out the next day and the pure starsan had completely emptied onto the back floor carpet which in the span of  hours had been dissolved into a puddle of black foulsmelling goo.

I also added a bit of melanoidin malt to this batch.  Got a nice spicyfloral taste from the Lubliner hops especially towards the finish.

11761443,0,t3_67q637,Did one for a little over a year. Heres a picture from when I was trying to find the air leaks  Pros  Cone... so trub etc is compacted for racking purposes. less beer loss.Inside is pretty smoothWide opening  Not too hard to rinse out and sponge a little bit.Plastic is thick and acts as insulation.Can roughly see liquid and krausen levelsI put a CIP ball on it. It was nice after I got a good pump.Cons  Nearly impossible to get an air tight seal on the lid. Every time I crashed it would suck a ton of oxygen in. Crashing things out in my opinion is a major plus of a cone. Ive gotten a few comments from Intergalactic Brewery here in San Diego. Theyve thrown a good handful of them so YMMV on the lid.Probably cost me about  to get it set up with fittings valves and coil. Not terrible but much more than the cheap zone.Even replacing the lid with another lid is not a great option since the outside of the cone is not smooth plastic. I tried.Normally not bad but a real pain in the ass to clean if krausen reaches the lid level. There is a big lip due to the way the lid is mounted and you pretty much have to disassemble it to get at it.My if I did it again strategy Install a CIP ball silicone the lid shut and make believe it is a huge stainless cone with no manway. If the lid worked this thing would be pretty decent. I ended up dumping too many beers to recommend it.,Homebrewing,dgt6tgd,1,t5_2qj8u

11802344,0,t1_dgxticu,For a L  batch I would use .kg of both base malts.I would use all of the Caramel .Use g Apollo at  min.Use .g of both of the other hops at  minutes remaining in the boil.Then I would use Citra and CTZ in double dry hopping as soon as fermentation slows down.  Use a hop bag to pull the hops out of the beer.  I would then dry hop again before racking to keg where I would add another dry hop.The calculated IBUs will be aimed towards the low end of a pale ale style but I account for the dry hop adding a solid perception of bitterness.  And this beer light on caramel malt will be dry and you dont want it too bitter in that case.     ,Homebrewing,dgxu4pm,1,t5_2qj8u
