953288,0,t3_2503zi,Jumping into the planetary space of the Imperium home base and immediately pooling all power into the upgraded stealth systems and jammers of my caterpillar while the rest of my small outfit man the scanners and turrets. I give the command for silent running were not here to put on a show. We zoom over the nearest moons horizon and position ourselves between this worlds sun and the massive Bengal carrier poised in orbit above the blue and red planet hanging in space below. We make our approach to the underside of the carrier and latch on with the docking ring. We use the  minutes it takes to carve through the alloy to change into imperium uniforms that we picked up from a bounty hunter two jumps away. A light turns green on my HUD go time. We head straight for the chief mates quarters some info we purchased told us he will be at his daughters birthday party while the carrier is in for repairs. I stand guard as my commsperson opens the cabin and  slips inside. They come out with logs containing the Imperiums plans for the next two weeks which is our biggest pay day yet. Someone will pay top dolla for this on the information market. KeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenEden is my destination stealth is my directive.,EdenDirect,chcnat3,1,t5_2zvkx
969582,0,t3_257p84,It will likely have more delays and be bit buggy but I cant wait to step out of the hangar. I say this not to put down the devs but from experience on software projects. This is the most ambitious game techwise ever by a wide margin. When at EA and Microsoft Chris pushed the envelope but this time he shredded it set it on fire and scattered the remains around the universe. Its what we want but there are reasons why publishers avoid such challenge  RampD is hard to schedule and too easy to suffer delays. But Chris Roberts will not stop until he realizes his vision.It will be awesome but it will take a while.,EdenDirect,chei1ul,3,t5_2zvkx

3831345,0,t1_cqszi4k,Well the problem is anything that is underpriced disappears and becomes unavailable. Say we undervalue the ships then everyone is clamoring to borrow the ships. The point of valuing the ships properly is to respect their limited supply and their value. If we have one under valued ship at say only  for the owner of the ship then that ship might be constantly in use but theres little incentive for anyone to buy another and put it into action even if theres demand for more. If the split is in exactly the right spot though the incentive to get the right number of ships available at the right split between labor and capital then overall everyone ought to benefit. Right now though labor seems to have a big advantage unlike the real world. Theres certainly more ships than members right now. Labor will be valued well depending on the reliabilitycost of NPCs. I think the main barrier will be making sure people have the skill set to use the ships properly and not damage them. The other point of a share company is to allow people to own pieces of a ship even if they cant afford a whole one so they can benefit that way as well. ,EdenDirect,cqt088h,1,t5_2zvkx

5370470,0,t1_cvxvlel,It depends on how good the NPC is.  If the NPC can fill in adequately for a spot or two on a ship and not impact gameplay then that greatly alleviates the issues of Looking For Group type pleas.  If a fleet of NPCs can always outrun and outgun player ships then this is a problem.  NPCs should be barely functional as a fully automated crew.,EdenDirect,cvy4z4q,1,t5_2zvkx
