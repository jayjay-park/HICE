6140842,0,t1_cynnao2,Ah yes those movies.  Until now Id wondered if we worked for the same corporation just different stores.  Now I know we dont because mine would rather burn the store down than offer any type of deal or sale on anything lol.  ,TalesFromAdultStores,cynne42,3,t5_3bnnr

Maybe its just the way you explained it but it seems a little bit like an overreaction. I could be wrong. Then again we now live in a society where something as innocuous as holding the door open for someone is seen as an insult to certain people which boggles my mind. Im also viewing this from the male perspective. There is this assumption that gets thrown around a lot unfairly that every guy is some stalker rapist criminal. We all tend to get lumped into this category of predators who are just out to attack women and be sleazy. I dont typically compliment women. Its not that I feel they are undeserving or that Im trying to be a bastard. Its that I cannot say anything nice without the automatic assumption that I am hitting on them. I think a lot of guys feel this way. Im not single and have no interest in the random women I cross paths with in my daily life but that has not stopped me from being accused of flirting or hitting on people for simple day to day social normatives. Im a genuinely nice guy to most people I encounter. What can I say? I guess it makes me ask where the line is drawn? Do I just have to go through life assuming every woman I meet thinks Im after her? That seems a bit extreme doesnt it? It certainly isnt a  way street when it comes to the assumptions that are made about me because Im a male. I only bring it up because my wife runs an adult novelty store and from time to time I do help her out in the store. Over the years I have gotten very good at telling the difference between a genuine creeper and just a socially awkward dude whos game is very lacking. I am no expert and I figure if I can spot the difference then other people should definitely be able to as well. Instead I feel like the majority of people make a blanket assumption about others and just lump us all into a category. ,TalesFromAdultStores,d6nnj6o,-18,t5_3bnnr
