You can also try downtown anywhere on Main Street or Morimotos Napa is effing amazing if you can swing it.  Theres also the Bilcos pool hall in that area as well and their wall of beer taps is awesome.,napa,celowyy,3,t5_2s89m

3613668,0,t1_cq468rd,Sure. I say experience rather than Experience because wine tasting really isnt about getting things right its about relaxing and learning what you personally enjoy. Having said that if you have never tasted before it takes a couple wineries to feel the rhythm of it. Three days? Thats a long list for a short time. Dont plan on more than  tastings per day. Sounds like you should extend your trip!Also factor wine shipping or bag checking into the cost of the wine.,napa,cq46n2r,3,t5_2s89m

9248436,0,t1_d8oapmu,Ive always found botanical gardens to be lovely spots for a private dinner. I dont know if this is realistic for you but many of them are wedding spots and they have staff to accommodate. If you want to splurge then this would be a lovely choice with great photo ops. If you need something a little more low key then maybe a local park or beach. Some restaurants may be willing to let you use their party room to have a dinner together if theyre not booked of course. A friend of mine did exactly that.Either way you know her best and will know what she would love the most. All the best to you both!,napa,d8ob2hy,1,t5_2s89m
