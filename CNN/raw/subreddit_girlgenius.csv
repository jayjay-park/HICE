6722289,0,t1_d0eird4,Similar to the experiment that Tarvek created to keep Anevka alive  the body was alive in the isolation tube until it wasnt and controlling a Muse.I suspect thats actually Van Rijns body running the same experiment. Agatha can fix it because she learned how Tarvek kept Anevkas Muse running.Edit Or shell transfer to another clank like she did with Von Pinn and the funsized happy playtime dog or whatever it was called,girlgenius,d0en59j,4,t5_2srcm

8267217,0,t1_d59808e,What is it about the Gunnerkrigg Court and Girl Genius fandoms that there is so much crossover?  They seem so different in pacing storytelling style themes etc. but I feel like there are a lot of us for whom these are our two favorite webcomics.Im just wondering aloud because I was going to recommend Gunnerkrigg Court when I saw this thread and it didnt have any comments yet but I hesitated because I couldnt figure out what it was about liking Girl Genius that makes me think someone would be into Gunnerkrigg too.,girlgenius,d5aykf3,3,t5_2srcm
