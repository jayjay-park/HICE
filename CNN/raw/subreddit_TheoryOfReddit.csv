From their sitegtTypically most existing enterpriseclass search engines provide keyword search over documents. These engines rely on functions of the matching and counters of word occurrences for fetching and ranking results. This induces a discrepancy between keywords and knowledge two documents may be about Artificial Intelligence amp Robots using mostly different sets of words.They are pretty vague on what exact method they are using but they are clustering together groups of text based on using similar words.,TheoryOfReddit,cek8hdm,1,t5_2rtff

227196,0,t1_cf3y1zx,I think its important to make a distinction between sexualization and sexism. Sexualization is to make someone into someonesomething that is desirable for primarily their sexual characteristics whereas sexism is to discriminate based on gender. There can definitely be crossover between the two and in both instances it can happen to either gender but at their roots they are both discrete concepts.A manwoman who is objectified for sexual purposes is someone who is desired based on physical characteristics alone regardless of other traits they may have. Sexism is in many ways the opposite of this they are not desired or are in some way looked at as lesser based solely on gender.Of course it could be argued that in both cases the person is made out to be less than human. Which is a perfectly valid argument because again there can definitely be crossover between the two concepts. But they arent necessarily the same.,TheoryOfReddit,cf4aok0,4,t5_2rtff

313300,0,t3_1xlspl,We recently made changes to the downvote button in rpolitics. Were monitoring it further for potential other changes.So far my personal data shows a marked decrease in downvotes from just making the downvote button smaller and fainter. Graying out content that youve downvoted to visibly show the act of censorship downvoting is reduced downvotes even further. A future change could be a text warning like some other subs use. Judging by the efficacy of the other changes in terms of statistical data Id be extremely surprised if it didnt have an effect. The question is where the tipping point is where users turn off the custom css and downvote rates increase again. Once the css goes off it doesnt easily come back on.But yes so far my data suggests that similar things work. I think the moddingmeta community is very insular and ascribes too much RES browsing and investment on the part of the regular users that make out the massive majority of our community. CSS changes matter and work. It doesnt solve the problem of opinion voting but it markedly helps. Especially in the new queue where it matters most posts need a fair chance of breaking out of new into hot based on merit rather than the opinion of the first few people who happen to see it.,TheoryOfReddit,cfd8qs8,8,t5_2rtff

375720,0,t3_1ydv9w,I think Reddit is built off of the lack of serious interpersonal engagement. It makes it easy to release an opinion without worrying about confrontation downvotes aside. Is this necessarily a bad thing? Well yes and no. As I mentioned earlier it does give a platform for other opinions to been seen which can be a good thing. However due to the anonymous nature of commenting people seem to forget common decency and etiquette while commenting which can lead to foul comments. I would argue that the main cause is the lack of incentive for replying back to commenters. I think it is an equivalent of being in a crowed classroom. People yell information but no is no personal communication. Simply yell your opinion then let the rest of the class duke it out. ,TheoryOfReddit,cfjpiua,2,t5_2rtff
386819,0,t3_1yhfrj,Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reasons Submissions with a question should at least contain a motivation for asking the question in the text field. Posts with nothing but a title will be removed.  It isnt necessarily a bad subject but the way you present it makes fall just outside the quality standards we and other subscribers expect. In case you did not see it yet we do have a guide to making quality posts in our wiki. It discusses many of the pitfalls people can encounter when making a post in rTheoryOfReddit. Here are some basic points you can ask yourself  Is my title descriptive enough for someone that does not know what the content will be?  Do I explain properly what I want to discuss why I want to discuss it and what my own thoughts are? A rule of thumb is that in general a submission with only a few lines of text is considered low effort by a lot of people simply because that is usually not enough to do all three properly.  Is my post constructive? Simply the tone of a post can determine if a post is suitable for rTheoryOfReddit or more for other meta themed subreddits with a different focus.  So by all means feel free to resubmit after rewording your post. If you have any questions we are more than happy to help you out.If you would like to appeal this decision or continue the discussion please feel free to do so by mod mailing us,TheoryOfReddit,cfkuygp,1,t5_2rtff

452729,0,t1_cfrk807,Holy crap. Thats a lot of material. Itll probably take a couple of months to sift through it. A quick check shows that it is peerreviewed and credible. Obviously this isnt necessarily the scientific consensus because you probably selected peerreviewed citations that support your stance but I dont expect you to cite criticism against your own position so that is completely fine. I guess the next step is to find any valid criticism and if there isnt any and your material makes sense then I learned something.,TheoryOfReddit,cfrq2v7,0,t5_2rtff
477248,0,t1_cfugv2k,I think some of it has to do with the inability to submit repost content that has already been submitted. For one websites that are submitted have almost definitely been submitted before sometime in the past.  So even if it was over a year ago nobody is able to post that website up again even though many people probably have not seen it and the site may be drastically different or updated.Similar to this many times when content is posted it is a matter of luck timing and proper title or a combination of all  for the post to be successful.  Somebody could make an unsuccessful post because they had a poor title or posted at am then if another user wanted to submit it they would be unable to regardless of the quality of the content.  a few of my favorite comedy videos Ive tried to post fall into this category the original posts were over a year old.All of these factors and others I dont know about combine to put a big strain on reddit to now post almost all original content now.  In the past when there was still other sites mixed in much of this original content could be related to the outside content posted on reddit.  Now that it is getting harder and harder to put outside content onto reddit the original content follows that same path and focuses on reddit itself.Another factor is having too many specific subreddits.  This forces only certain content to be put in front of a large enough audience to ever have a chance of getting to the front page. example there are many subreddits of funny now with low numbers of subscribers. You are forced to post a lot of content into these smallers subs that will never see anything close to the front page.  This applies to many different categories on reddit.  If the new thing I found on the internet doesnt fit into the big default categories im pretty much SOL of it ever getting to the front page regardless of how much reddit might actually want to see it.I believe the biggest change that brought this about and the biggest reddit killer was the removal of the ability to post to all.  In the past if you had an article that didnt fit exactly into one of the major subs but you thought was interesting enough that the general reddit audience would upvote it to the front page you could submit it to all and it may have a shot. No more.   This has also hurt the diversification of reddit content.  Example No more can someone post a conservative leaning article that the reddit community as a whole might actually appreciate.  You are forced to post in conservative where it will never get more than  votes and never be on the front page.  Only the most liberal of articles posted to politics will ever have a chance.Pretty much we have ended up with a giant narcissistic self commentary website that grows more and more uninteresting as there are fewer outside articles posted.,TheoryOfReddit,cfuil0d,3,t5_2rtff
528122,0,t1_cg06ruc,My claim is more general than that. Any group is going to have erroneous myths and superstitions that it accepts as fact. Questioning those will be seen as a waste of time if not outright trolling. Its not really a problem until mods pick a side and delete the opposition.I dont know how it applies to history experts at least they are aware that history is written by the victors and that what we know about the past is always suspect. That doesnt mean the whole discipline is immune to blind spots toward favourite or selfserving myths.,TheoryOfReddit,cg0ayeq,1,t5_2rtff
544507,0,t3_20d0rf,While there is probably an average number that answers your question it will not be a very meaningful number on its own. I believe the most important influencing factor is the type of topic covered by the post. For instance Is the main content in the original post or the replies? For instance compare rAdviceAnimals to rAskScience where the latter will need to generate discussion to be meaningful.  Is the information static or unfolding over time? Consider for instance a post on rworldnews about a demonstration in a country. The issue later escalates with widespread protests and you get lots of media coverage that is grouped in a megathread. This too eventually becomes unmanageable and a subreddit is started on the topic. A recent example is the disappearing MH flight which now even has rTomNod.While the ideal reply count is a function of the topic itself it is also a function of Reddits design your point b. At some point no matter how novel or insightful a reply is it will effectively be buried and not contribute to the discussion. The threshold at which it will be necessary to split off a discussion into multiple discussions is directly affected by this design. Compare for instance Reddit Twitter and Wikipedia. Wiki articles are great for storing facts but not a very userfriendly solution for high numbers of people to exchange opinions and ideas. Twitter is great for quickly sharing small facts and opinions especially if they relate to a linked resource but its terrible as a fact database. Reddits hierarchical discussion threads with ranked posts combined with its large userbase makes it a pretty good platform for handling discussions of varying size.TLDR On Reddit Id say the ideal number of replies per post varies by subreddit from  to around  depending on type of content.Source Four years of research on a different social media platform. Apparently Reddit likes to peer review posts.,TheoryOfReddit,cg260xx,14,t5_2rtff

Regardless I used RES in the past in conjunction with the reddit gold feature of loading more comments to zip through a largely popular comment thread. Id look for controversial vote scores such as | or | and open up all replied below that comment. Id often find unruly people there.The change to the vote scores has made this impossible as a comment with | now shows as  which doesnt nearly catch my eye as much.

1264759,0,t1_cibv9gx,gt To me reddit is much more about discussion and discussion of content than content. To me its important to see what areas of discussion are the busiest. That is something thats been removed with no replacementThats what sorting by top and best do they show you where the activity is. If youre only browsing by vote totals theres also a hell of a lot of good new content that you may be missing because it hasnt been voted on yet by people who are doing just like yourself.Seriously this all boils back to a problem that started years ago and people let their vote and the numbers speak for them. You cant claim to like discussion then let the simple numbers tell you where to go.  If you like the discussion use the discussion.  Who gives a fuck how popular a sentiment is if nobody is engaging you in a conversation? And thats what usually happens when you only follow the vote totals. Gauge a post by its content by the discussion it elicits. Its position in the thread should be indicative of its value to the community not the pointless number beside it. Honestly if that shit is the only stuff keeping you here or keeping you using gold and not any of the other benefits of the site or perks of the service reddit would probably be better off without you anyways.

1477644,0,t1_cj0y9kn,The barrier to entry is high. One must first spool up a Ubuntu VM and then go through a lengthy install process. At the time that I installed a copy of reddit I actually had to debug the install script because it was broken. My fixes were then merged into the project. The install script also clones the public github repo which isnt really the right way to do things at all if you plan to contribute code back. Fork and pull requires a fork to be effective. One way to address this would be to package a selfcontained Ubuntu VM with a copy of the install script or a complete copy of reddit like the PyCon flash drive install for example and to update the install script to make it easier to set up for fork and pull development. I actually had to change the hardcoded repository name in the script when I did this myself.Beyond that the codebase is fairly large and not entirely straightforward and there lacks any sort of documentation that I could find on basic logic flow for pageloads or anything like that. So the process of learning enough about the codebase to make any change beyond fixing a typo is fairly involved.The last code I contributed took multiple weeks of backandforth with uslyf whose assistance was invaluable. I was working on code he had recently modified paginated banlist stuff I was contributing an API update and even he wasnt entirely clear on how it should be. We got it sorted but I ended up refactoring a fair number of API thing listing generator classes which took a while because none of the code conventions were documented. Wed always be finding Oh they do this like that in X Class so we should do it that way. In the end uDeimorz still ended up merging in a breaking change that nobody in the review process caught and it was halfway through server rollout when someone notified him that something was broken. It was for an arcane feature whose existence I didnt even know of and because of the lack of documentation on logic flow for the whole system didnt occur to me or even to slyf or Deimorz that our changes impacted that.Whats even the status on testing? Does reddit have tests and did I just entirely miss them or are they basically nonexistant?I understand that theres only so much that can be done to mitigate learning a whole new codebase but these things combine to make it so even I having been through the process and successfully contributed code would rather just write  lines of JavaScript into rtoolbox and be done with it for example adding the ham and spam buttons to comments so you can change the removal type without having to first approve then reremove it.,TheoryOfReddit,cj1hyq2,4,t5_2rtff

1856829,0,t1_ckcwnym,Depends on the issue I guess. If the issue is with the mods then they call for the admins to step in and save them. During the Occupy Wallstreet protests there was a push to bring back the repealed provisions of the GlassSteagall Act. A more recent example is the fear of job loss from automation and globalization where the idea of implementing Basic Income receives overwhelming support. Reddit certainly has a libertarian presence but its limited to certain areas in my experience. Libertarianisms socially liberal side allows it to get its foot in the door but not too much further. The Bitcoin and Economics subreddits are certainly libertarian although reconomics has been shifting subtly left as it grows. rpolitics is full blown socialist but now that it isnt a default its influence may have weakened. rnews has been leftist for most of its history but I suppose it sometimes lets in some libertarian stuff these days. Last I checked the post of Obamas win in his first election was the top post of all time. Were you thinking of any particular large subreddits that seem libertarian?

However we didnt want it to be how many serverminuteshours of all the servers because then over time as the number of servers increases one month of reddit gold would appear to pay for less and less and we felt that might feel really bad  and the point of that stat was to help people feel good about their gold contributions.  Not sure if that tradeoff in terminology was the right one though.There is an annoying news piece circulating around right now from Ars Digita I think saying that reddit earned enough gold from the celeb nudes thing to pay for a whole month of its servers which is not true  it paid for one month of a single server out of many hundreds.

2395693,0,t1_cm7br60,Although AskX is arguably a form of content creation it is indeed as you and uDaeres stated content created on reddit and for reddit. This means that they are within the line of sight of those that manage communities. In the case of content created on a external website it becomes harder to judge with what intention the content is shared on reddit. There are a lot of people like you that just like to blog and share that content with as much people as possible just for the content. What you however have to understand is the fact that a vast majority of blogs submitted to many subreddits are not of that nature. In no particular order you have blogs that  Are purely revenue driven    Self written content with a number of ads       Relatively good quality content.       More often poorly written content or just only images.   Content rewritten from legitimate sources with ads.    Content blatantly ripped from legitimate sources with tons of ads.    Basically no content just ads.  Are written with a political agenda.  Are a front with one good article but besides that filled with low quality stuff or once again politically drive content.  Are written to promote a product in itself.     Fake reviews.     Fake news articles about the release of a product or crowdfunding campaign. Which has resulted in many subreddits already automatically removing anything from the wordpress and blogspot domains and mods not having a favorable stance against blogs in general. In rhistory this does present us with a problem because many historians have their own blog yet we still have to deal with the ridiculous amount of blog spam. So we try to navigate this minefield as best we can which is one reason why we created rhistoryblogs as a place where we will be not as strict in our enforcement regarding blogs. Having said that I do understand that it is an equally difficult thing is to navigate for someone who just writes blogs for the content. Which is why many mods favor self posts over blogs because that means that a lot of the potential problems of blogs are simply not present. ,TheoryOfReddit,cm7td0i,3,t5_2rtff

In case you did not see it yet we do have a guide to making quality posts in our wiki. It discusses many of the pitfalls people can encounter when making a post in rTheoryOfReddit. Here are some basic points you can ask yourself  Is my title descriptive enough for someone that does not know what the content will be?  Do I explain properly what I want to discuss why I want to discuss it and what my own thoughts are? A rule of thumb is that in general a submission with only a few lines of text is considered low effort by a lot of people simply because that is usually not enough to do all three properly.  Is my post constructive? Simply the tone of a post can determine if a post is suitable for rTheoryOfReddit or more for other meta themed subreddits with a different focus.

There is a perfectly acceptable word for what you are describing a word that has been used for years now Moderation Now there is good moderation bad moderation and awful moderation. On all three of these you can technically put the censorship label. However censorship is mostly used in a negative context where people want to attach a level of severity that isnt there. It is often implied to be related to censorship from governments or to be on the same level. Which frankly is offensive to people facing censorship in their daily lives and cant simply avoid it by creating a alt accountmoving to another subredditetc. To quote the wikipedia definition Censorship is the suppression of speech which simply is fundamentally impossible because of how reddit works. So think about this for a moment. Do you really want to discuss how subreddits are moderated? Or do you want to make it a political issue by equaling moderating removal of posts and comments with what some governments do to their citizens persecuting citizens ?

4545439,1,t1_ct3k5mu,gtCorrelation is not causation. The reason the metasphere is getting bigger is because reddit is getting bigger and more is happening on it. Its the same reason why the drek is getting louder as well. Also you keep saying its not a big deal and you never see it then go on to say its all being caused by the metasphere and its terrible that the meta is causing these issues.So how do you explain the dozens of extremely distasteful NSFW subs not being an issue for reddit growing or flourishing? Theyre not bothering anybody and they mostly get ignored. Dogmatic bullies on reddit only seem to focus on certain categories of content because it aligns with their ideology. If there was a colorblind implementation of some of the  suggested prohibitions youd see a lot more content and contributors disappear than just people saying mean or sexist things. gtAnd its not an issue specific to any sub but is a reflection of the laissez faire attitude that reddit has taken so far that there are no real incentives for mods to put in the time and energy in keeping the site clean and the hate subs dont need to link to anything in order to workshop their propaganda and organize their proselytizers. I wouldnt count them as a metasub. Honestly to me SRS and SRD are more toxic than anything coon or hate. For people who agree with racism or exclusion its not changing any minds for those who disagree it isnt swaying them either. What I do see are more and more people stirring up shit that no one saw or cared about. I see circlejerks and memes about how theyre so stupid and wrong and other dogmaflairand bullying. That annoys me more than racist comments that are downvoted into negatives the vast majority of the time anyway. I think a large number of people would agree.

4741610,0,t3_3fttf9,Ill paste the comment I generally make whenever this sort of thing is suggested in rideasfortheadminsIf you look at the voting data of both submissions and comments through the history of all of reddit youll see that only a small percentage of total votes are downvotes.Massdownvoting isnt the issue. The issue is that few people bother voting on things they read and find interesting and contributing to the conversation. So the issue isnt that people downvote too much its that people upvote too little.And to make things worse the few people who do vote do so for the wrong reasons because they likedislike something because they agreedisagree with something because they want something to gainlose exposure.Therefore your suggestion isnt a good idea it changes things for the worse evenbecause it punishes the people who vote rather than incentivizing more voting which is what we actually need a demographic shift in voting so people vote for more reasons and its not just the people that feel very strongly about something that do vote.Additionally reddits sorting system is extremely vulnerable to early votes so incentivizing early voting especially helps reduce the impact of vote cheating and brigading in almost all circumstances where it isnt super obvious that youre cheating with dozenshundreds of bots. Making downvoting harder also neuters redditors ability to collectively moderate through their downvotes previously known as downmods for that reason the default option across all reddit accounts is to hide all submissions at  or less entirely from view you have to opt in to see them as it is.,TheoryOfReddit,cts836a,19,t5_2rtff

4933143,0,t3_3ig28y,I dont think phenomenologists would deny that an upvote produces a qualitative feeling similar to the support felt in a real skin to skin hug. Dreyfuss hangup is his recognition that hugs are something that only an embodied subject could experience outright indeed only emobodied subjects that is. Just because an upvote produces a similarity in feeling of support of belonging etc it still cannot transcend the virtual medium through which it produces its effect. This is an issue for phenomenologists who want to say that embodiment is prime. The hug is fully realized in corporeality with arms clinging together heat being transferred and much like in the upvote when support is felt. But actual hugs produce something acutely specific to the experiencer that is not found in the upvote actual contact between bodies. This is not something reproducible through the internet because bodies cannot touch and so the support felt between the two mediums is fundamentally different rather than the same. ,TheoryOfReddit,cugd1et,7,t5_2rtff

I hope you dont mind that its buried down here in the comment chain.Youre undoubtedly familiar with the sight of people regardless of age with their faces looking in the direction of a connected device. Im in my s and I admit to being one of them.The fascination with having a connection to the entire world is simply intoxicating.Literal intoxication also comes into play. So does social status and the lack thereof. Smug people are smug and shutins need to pretend that theyre someone else.Its fairly easy to recollect the posts from the timeframe you describe and come to a reasonable conclusion that the majority of the responses you describe were generated on average by males between the ages of  and  . Heres a Pew Research Report detailing mobile social media usage by demographic.Notice that different social media sites attract different demographics. Thats an important factor to consider while finding an answer to your question.As stated by ubarrelroller in this post an individual can choose to be a member of many social media sites assume different personas or none at all and interact with the community that suits their current mood.Ill bet you a shot of Johnny Walker Blue that more than one account on a businessoriented job seeking site is associated with someone who posts to a chan.I dont play the game EveOnline but this quote from a Goon may shed some lightgt ...there is the much more unsettling opposite idea of the domination of my screen persona over my real self. Our social identity the person we assume to be in our social intercourse is already a mask that involves the repression of our inadmissible impulses. But it is precisely in the conditions of just playing  when the rules regulating our real life exchanges are temporarily suspended  that we can permit ourselves to display these repressed attitudes. Take the proverbial impotent shy person who while participating in a cyberspace interactive game adopts the identity of an irresistible seducer or sadistic murderer. It is all too simple to say that this identity is just an imaginary escape from reallife impotence. The point is rather that since he knows that the cyberspace interactive game is just a game he can show his true self and do things he would never have done in reallife interactions. In the guise of a fiction the truth about himself is articulated. The fact that I perceive my virtual selfimage as mere play thus allows me to suspend the usual hindrances which prevent me from realising sic my dark half in real life. My electronic id is given wing.I hope that helps.Reddit is simply a soft target for bored people with an abusive nature to anonymously pick on strangers with their fellow bored anonymous friends.This is why we rall currently in love with rSweden.,TheoryOfReddit,d24nd7p,4,t5_2rtff

8049526,0,t1_d4ks13s,I came to a crappy realization a few years ago politicians suck.If you think about politics in general its a bunch of people who have no practical skills.  Sure they may have been lawyers or something at some point but they then chose a career that values only these things Being electable Making deals Outmaneuvering competition WinningThey are not experts in anything.  Other people write the laws they sponsor and they rely on lobbyists to tell them what is happening in the real world outside Washington.Their profession doesnt invent new technologies generate new ideas or do all that much to advance human kind.  At best they implement good technologies and ideas that will benefit society through legislation and at worst they do the same thing with bad technology and bad ideas.  But ultimately those things are created by other people academics inventors think tanks etc.But because politicians create laws they always write themselves into the process of controlling society so were stuck with them.  And creating laws is a powerful position that lots of people want influence over so politicians are the gatekeepers to succeeding in society.  The fastest way to succeed or fail as a business is to have a politician support or kill your product.So we rely on our gatekeepers to control our society but by their very definition they are not knowledgable about what they are legislating and their skillset only includes the things they need to stab each other in the back.So knowing that you realize that youll never get a perfect ethical decent human being as a politician.  They put on a good show but in reality theyre all basically death eaters in makeup I know a few politicians personally and they make me uncomfortable when Im around them  so sleazy.In order to get your technology and ideas promoted and possibly enacted into law you need to find the death eater that represents your views and put vote them into office.

For instance forums run by game companies can be stalinesque in their ruthless eradication of negative opinions. rflightsim has regular postings from people banned from various forums connected to game companies. rhoggit just had a post about a modder who made a substantial and comprehensive mod being banned from the official game forums because he asked for donations.

10489709,0,t3_5q78qg,I think youre right on the trend. I also think this penalizes a lot of the most serious publications from subreddits like many newsrelated subreddits that demand the submission title be identical to the article title rather than a userwritten neutral executive summaryThe online socialmedia geared sites have their opinionated executive summary titles ready to go which leads to worse reporting being more prominent than it would otherwise be.The difficulty is of course that the summaries people write themselves arent often accurate and are even more agendapushing than the alternative which is often visible in rall.,TheoryOfReddit,dcx4a2m,5,t5_2rtff
10494524,0,t3_5q78qg,The same way media writers want clicks Redditors want upvotes.  Ive seen a lot of political news stories given more inflammatory titles on Reddit so people will agree with them without clicking.

10558092,0,t3_5r3m11,Alexis doesnt seem to much of a handle on why Reddit or any other social network operates as they do.Facebook works because its a network. It made verifiable identity a huge deal from the very first moments because anonymity renders the platform useless. It uses these verifiable credentialed people to build real verifiable connections between real people and after a decade of this they can build real tools news distribution ads videos live streaming on and on right on top of a very solid identity base.Reddit is a publishing platform first and foremost and one that feels that it hasnt adapted from the times at all. It barely feels a step beyond the BBSes I was posting on nearly  years ago. Too many systems are ancient obsolete or obscure. It has a learning curve that makes new entry a bit of a pain compared to friendliness of Facebook or to a lesser extent Twitter.As an aggregator and publishing platform its greatest strength isnt either its the community thats cropped over the years that Ohanian has been lucky to not obliterate with a lot of his headstrong decisions over the years see Pao. I dont have any relationships with anyone on here. Reading through article after article each comment I read is essentially from a new person. I dont even see the value that having a friends network here would be because it doesnt affect how Im digesting the content.If Reddit wants to be big they need to compete with WordPress not Facebook. This site feels old and creaky and still feels lackluster on mobile. Alexis however will continue his wild experiments I suppose.,TheoryOfReddit,dd4vnr3,3,t5_2rtff

10719316,0,t1_ddllep5,gtThats policy. The practice is what we actually see which is heavy downvoting for political opinions stated in enemy territory personal insults witch hunting and polarization.You are pretending that everyone is like this. If even  percent of the people who viewed the thread developed more moderate political viewpoints that would be a major success. That would be about  people who became a bit more reasonable. gtThere isnt some outside force creating polarization among redditors its human tribalism acting out in a completely natural and expected fashion.Just because something is natural doesnt mean it cant be tweaked. This is the exact same explanation for all of the inadvertent advertisements we see on Reddit. Some of them have a corporate product in the image with perfect lighting and the logo is perfectly placed. Others will say regular people do this all of the time so you cant prove it was a shill post. Well duh. If this wasnt a normal behavior shills wouldnt do it. It would be too obvious. They can only exaggerate what is already there. We know for a fact that shills post advertisements online. Its just difficult to prove specific examples. US military studied how to influence Twitter and Reddit users in Darpafunded researchThere are a ton more links like that here I hope you read some of them. In the era of sockpuppetry of course there will be whistleblowers. Heres one example  Once we isolate key people we look for people we know are in their upstream  people that they read posts from but who themselves are less influential. We then either start flame wars with bots to derail the conversations that are influencing influential people or else send off specific tasks for sockpuppets changing this wording of an idea here cause an ideological split there etc.You can read more of those here,TheoryOfReddit,ddlm9e4,1,t5_2rtff

I thought that was the philosophy around here. gt Reddit is worthwhile because it isnt a collection of every single piece of shit that dribbles out of a particular person.According to your preferences.

11379545,0,t1_dflu8gd,gtWho wants to subscribe to subreddit full of empty subs?Well literally every single subreddit ever started out empty. So someone must want to subscribe to those empty subs and hence those users might want to see a list of those empty subs. Also the subscribers of rnewreddits and other subreddit discovery subreddits.gtUsually and I think you know this being such an old user popular offshoot subs are created in the subs they branch from or other very popular subreddits.And sometimes the original mods are hostile to this sort of thing and so an alternative sub is necessary. If my sub becomes very popular it could serve this function as one more other very popular subreddit except one that is specifically for those brave souls willing to challenge an already existing subreddit.I also made my sub to illustrate how rarely the new sub gets more subscribers than the old sub. ,TheoryOfReddit,dflup0q,3,t5_2rtff

11561551,0,t3_650fpv,I think anecdotally anyone thats been on Reddit long enough has experienced something similar.Your visibility in those massive threads is just too low and often doesnt receive any votes or maybe isnt even seen by anyone at all. When a thread is still small users can read over most if not all of the comments and vote accordingly.In those massive threads Your comment probably repeats a point or sentiment thats already been posted by someone before you. There are too many comments to notice yours. It simply doesnt stand out.In the end its a problem most pronounced in the large subs and even then the actual impact seems minimal. But lets assume its a problem that needs to be addressed  are there any good solutions? Defaulting to random or new for comments doesnt seem useful nor is there any way to rank a comments usefulness without votes.,TheoryOfReddit,dg6i8no,24,t5_2rtff

11589992,0,t3_65f4o4,Probably some combination of the hating reddit being more of a meme than an actual opinion the diversity of users there some of whom presumably like reddit and the fact that if you want to actually see the highquality or amusing content from chan you need some aggregator like reddit to do it.,TheoryOfReddit,dg9qev0,70,t5_2rtff
11620022,0,t1_dgd2fsg,You said the algorithm is burying stories though. Thats different to giving preferential treatment to subs. A given story could be posted to any sub.Its also good for all not to depend on an absolute hotness metric as the result would be too homogenous showing only a few subs with the most aligned communities and quickly digestible content and being vulnerable to domination from subs that repeatedly gamed the system like td and its stickies.Reddit sucking for news  isnt that primarily because of the political polarisation of the user base? The uncensorednewstd side which focuses on content along the lines of Muslims doing bad things and the newspolitics side with their Trump criticism articles.Oddly enough one type of news Reddit does push to the frontpage is news of musicianfilmstaretc deaths.,TheoryOfReddit,dgd528r,2,t5_2rtff
