10392026,0,t1_dclyxdu,All very interesting yes. Do you know if psychological testing takes place regularly as a matter of course? How frequently? Its often hard to detect personality problems in a single evaluation because a lot of people know how to present well. Corrie sounds like one of those people. I could see how he could have passed the initial standards.Its harder to imagine his instability not being detected over time however. ,ChasingCorrieMckeague,dcm02yd,1,t5_3imqy

Probably would as there are no landfills in Suffolk I understand. But I do agree with whoever mentioned that we might be wrong to focus on rubbish from the HS.The phone with or without C pinged in the opposite direction to Milton but rubbish from that area could have been sent to Milton. Ergo the police could now have intelligence that points to foul play around B Mills.,ChasingCorrieMckeague,ddkn1gh,3,t5_3imqy
10714982,0,t1_ddl156i,Thank you. This is the sort of info Im looking for. Have considered Corrie had more than one phone.

10723764,0,t1_ddm1qkj,He didnt appear to be too out of it in the cctv after his sleep in the doorway.  He appeared to be walking fairly normally i.e. Not swaying etc. I cannot believe that after  hours sleep a relatively normal walk afterwards that he would think that sleeping in a bin would be a good idea. You would have to be absolutely hammered to consider sleeping in a bin.  Given that there is no forensic evidence to suggest foul play in horseshoe its possible that Corrie exited in vehicle willingly or went into a building or walked out without being captured on cctv. Also given that police requested landfill not to accept any more rubbish early on suggests they had suspicion he could be there from beginning.  Searching landfill is going to take long time and cost a lot to do  they clearly have further evidence now to justify cost of doing it or else they would have done it earlier.,ChasingCorrieMckeague,ddm2rqd,3,t5_3imqy
