5329800,0,t1_cvsx5xa,In general southern states such as Alabama Georgia West Virginia etc. are more rural more Republican and less Progressive than the north. I do not say that in an insulting way its just the history they have and the fact that theres not a whole ton to do there. The bible belt is down south and therefore a lot of parts are VERY religious. All Americans like their guns but the south REALLY likes their guns. Lots of hunting down there. Much of the south gets stereotyped as hicks and a good part of it is. Not the entire south though and just bc someone may be a hick doesnt mean they arent educated. DAMN good food down south though a lot heavier and more rich. They do BBQ right down there. Things tend to move slower down south than up north as well. Theres a type of Southern Hospitality that you dont see as much up north. I only referred to it as dirty south as a bit of a joke it comes from the rap scene that is from down there. Theres definitely something to be said for the south and if you are interested check it out. In general though Id assume you would stick to mostly northern states unless you wanna go to Florida or New Orleans or Atlanta bc otherwise theres not much going on down there. Also for reference I am talking mostly about the east coast of the country. The Midwest and the West coast are a whole different world in themselves.EDIT Other Americans please chime in if you feel I misrepresented or left something out! Im not from the South so I am sure there are others who could describe it better than I did. ,ThingsIWishIKnew,cvsxxtx,2,t5_2u3p4

8198049,0,t3_4rjmgh,Give yourself a lot of time at first to get lost big cities are much less forgiving than towns when it comes to wrong turns and missed exits so give yourself a buffer so you have a less stressful trip.  Driving in the city is stressful enough so keeping the time stress at a minimum is essential.Take into account rush hour times I have found that google maps is at least decent at estimating delays and such so let that help you estimate time still take into about point .  I live in the driving hell of Boston but it can easily take  times longer to get somewhere during rush hour than other times.  When going to a new place also give yourself time to park.  Montreal is probably better than Boston but I usually have to plan about  extra minutes to find a place to park and then walk to where I want to be.  Plan longer if you want to pay less and shorter if you are ok with paying more.I have been driving in cities with notoriously bad driversroads for about  years now After living in a small midwestern town before so feel free to throw some other questions at me.,ThingsIWishIKnew,d52b56u,2,t5_2u3p4
