8345844,0,t3_4tqs10,I posted this in another thread in rAdvancedProduction some time ago Gabber and shranz techniques probably stuff like bussing open hat and kick samples together compressing the living shit out of them distorting like a maniac and then filtering and eqing to get a ride sound out of them. There are more stuff like that but this is the one I really liked and can remember from the top of my head.Gabber is as far as I know dead today but producers of it had a lot of really interesting and unique techniques that are useful for todays techno and more experimental music I should really find some of the old forums about it since some techniques i learned from some of the producers really stuck with me and I use them all the time.Also check out Randomers RA interview Machine Love Randomer,TheOverload,d5ks892,2,t5_353v6
