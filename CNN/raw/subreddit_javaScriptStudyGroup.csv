6404596,0,t1_czhmq4g,While grocery shopping yesterday I all of a sudden kinda get nested loops now. In order for me to log the pattern I need the outer loop to provide the variable which dictates how many character the inner loop will log. I eagerly came home to try it out and I think Im kinda getting it?? I just need another  hours to play with it over and over. I took a look week threes assignment but I dont think j Im at that level yet. But I will give it my best shot.Thanks so much for getting back to me so quickly and thoroughly! Youre the best.,javaScriptStudyGroup,czhmydr,2,t5_3bu7c
6721910,0,t1_d0egefl,Thanks!!Yes thats the redundancy I was talking about. Yeah I like your approach! Is that what is meant by functionalmodular programming? Or just modular or something?I did notice theres some clippingchunklag whatever you want to call it on the modification you supplied. When refactoring mine I had it at first too but then I moved the clearRect from the spin function and put it in to the drawArc function... that seemed to smooth it out at least on mine.Heres where Im at  Its only drawing the last arc... I think Im running in to a synchronicity problem..? Could a promise help here?I see you used setInterval to do something but I dont quite follow it... Care to give some pointers? Thanks!!Are you going to submit something? Id love to take a look at your fractal tree again... or something new... that fractal tree was bad ass though!,javaScriptStudyGroup,d0elqig,2,t5_3bu7c
6732916,0,t1_d0foiwy,I like what you did there. Hopefully later I will find more time to look at properly how you drew that spiral seems to me that this canvas thing makes us all freshen up on our algebra Concerning your question keep in mind though that I have never worked with canvas or animations before It seems to me that your rotation steps are simply too high. I got that fixed first by introducing the . factor and increasing the  to . But then it was super slow. So then I was like well then obviously increase the animationspeed. And I think then I discovered how you tripped yourself up From my understanding you have to link the speed to the interval that you are setting but you were using it as a factor that influences the rotation steps.Look at my tiny changes to your fiddle havent linked the speed but that is easily done. But I am sure there are better ways to do this. Just the quick solution that I came up with.Edit For some reason the spiral brakes from time to time now... dont know why that is,javaScriptStudyGroup,d0fqqea,3,t5_3bu7c

7239630,0,t1_d20vsmg,Fantastic!Looking through it line by line... thinking of some questions...Why do you store all of your elemsnodes in a saved vars array? Is that just to give the collection array methods like forEach or something?    let armoryMult  armoryLvl   ?     per lvl. lvl when lvl     armoryLvl   ? armoryLvlarmoryLvlWhats a when statement do?    numberWithCommasincWithout.toFixedWhat in the world are the special chars doing there?Working with localStorage there... very nice! Maybe we should do a weekly focus on cookieslocalStorage! I havent done much with either...    localStorage.getItemeach || Is that valid syntax? Looks like its missing an ...   outString  lttrgtltthgtUpgradeltthgtThere it is again! What do the s do?    skillCalc.initReally basiccommon and I feel I should already know this but... Why wrap the whole thing in an init function? And... init is a method of skillCalc?.. which is itself a function?...Obviously feel free to answer my questions or not!  Theyre just kind of what popped in to my head as I was reading through it.Really cool man! And you said that the community of players appreciated it too? Thats great! Solid work!!,javaScriptStudyGroup,d213d5r,2,t5_3bu7c

7842804,0,t1_d3vpfgl,Are you seeing the difference between when you add an object property the normal way vs using set with the Map?,javaScriptStudyGroup,d3xllf2,3,t5_3bu7c
