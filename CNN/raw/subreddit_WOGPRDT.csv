6881370,0,t3_4a02ii,Im not sure if it isnt too slow but for sure itll be an interesting card and everyone will try it out.  My prediction Pure CThun decks wont work BUT it will see play with lets say twothree support cards in currently existing archetypes.,WOGPRDT,d0wbhd8,0,t5_3d1h6

6910290,0,t1_d0zli2w,Belcher isnt senjin and goldshire stapled together. Only would be if it were a battlecry. Also goldshire is an awful card so not actually worth its  mana anyway. And Belcher is also an amazing card. ,WOGPRDT,d0zloby,1,t5_3d1h6
6980304,0,t1_d17jwv5,Youre right but in this fast metagame people tend to play a lot of battlecry minions. If the metagame slows way down and continual effects become a thing then maybe you could see a copy priest deck that runs Faceless Manipulators Herald Converts and Resurrects. That sounds like a super fun deck but it would never be viable enough.,WOGPRDT,d17k16h,2,t5_3d1h6
6983585,0,t3_4au5yv,We need someone to do an analysis on how many battlecry minions are at each mana cost to find the best time to use it. Obviously it can be played for tempo but im sure each mana cost could be ranked. ,WOGPRDT,d17xg4n,1,t5_3d1h6
6985777,0,t1_d16z00h,Im kinda surprised it isnt summon  copies of your opponents minions because That would fit more with the theme of the original Herald Volazj fight and its more in the theme of Priest.,WOGPRDT,d186f9j,1,t5_3d1h6
6992151,0,t1_d182a48,Yeah but at turn  your opponent probably dont have that many cards in hand to rebuild his board. But you magically HAVE these cards. Because you Doom.,WOGPRDT,d18wigq,2,t5_3d1h6

7035712,0,t1_d1dk4cs,You literally get the same mana cost per weapon damage with rogue and justicar.  mana for two s. Only thing is that rogue gets a body and cheaper uses after . Justicar is unplayable in rogue,WOGPRDT,d1durd0,6,t5_3d1h6

7062662,0,t1_d1gvxnk,The Shaman legendary accomplishes this by virtue of two cards  the legendary and removal. It doesnt do anything by itself. This guy is capable of the same with two cards  play him and heal say  health and then use removal.The legendary is obviously better and leaves a much scarier minion but its a class legendary.,WOGPRDT,d1gwwmp,4,t5_3d1h6
7103796,0,t3_4ctumy,I have a hard time believing this. Its so obviously too good. Although I guess murlocs definitely need something broken to be playable. And it doesnt seem broken enough to be an April fools joke.,WOGPRDT,d1ll6jc,1,t5_3d1h6

7185903,0,t1_d1uyigy,I cant tell what your criteria is here for the spells you listed?  You listed  of the  known Warlock spells didnt consider Wild vs. Standard and didnt seem to consider playability at all since you listed spells like Demonheart and Dark Bargain which see almost no play and didnt list spells like PO and Twisting Nether which see a ton of play.Did you just randomly pick  warlock spells to rattle off?  ,WOGPRDT,d1uz3uk,1,t5_3d1h6
7187507,0,t1_d1uhdjq,I think the versatility it what makes it so good. It can be played with warlocks board clears shadow flame hellfire even twisting nether if youre desperate. Then theres cards that almost make this a tempo card. Shadow bolt dark bomb bane of doom siphon soul. All that you get with a big body you can play by turn  or have  extra mana by turn . I just think theres too many scenarios where chogal fits for any downside to overcome that. We know the most versatile cards are the most competitively viable and this is warlocks most versatile card to date.,WOGPRDT,d1v5ox7,1,t5_3d1h6
7188045,1,t3_4dxmcs,Its a worse Argent Squire because of buffs. But we could see in constructed. Constructed play all about synergy and this card has potential.,WOGPRDT,d1v7wbk,3,t5_3d1h6

7266155,0,t1_d2435o9,Because it says After in the text although not positive if that will hold since it is just a translation i would agree that it is the latter of your scenarios. Much like flamewaker whose effect says After and so if you cast stealth on him with like conceal he will lose stealth since his effect procs after the conceal. Unlike Antonidas whose effect says When you cast a spell which procs before the spell is cast so he can be concealed. Same goes for Violet teacher text is when a spell is cast so she summons her apprentice and then the spell is cast so cards like power of the wild buffs the apprentice summoned as well. ,WOGPRDT,d2440c7,1,t5_3d1h6
7300331,0,t1_d27z0ho,In fatigue warrior you dont have a lot of minions out so whatever you play is likely to get cleared.  Makes more sense for them to run a useful card than wait for this to both turn into something useful and to be at a state to play it.Interesting card from golden monkey though.,WOGPRDT,d27zxpg,2,t5_3d1h6
7323741,0,t3_4fokj8,I dont think theres a reason to play this anymore. Rarely do people choose to restore  health and with azure Drake you get  for  less mana  spell damage. Plus with BGH increasing to  mana  attack minions will probably become more prevalent and this doesnt trade at all with them. On top of that with FoNSR being nerfed using this to dig through your deck to find one or both pieces of the combo is not a priority anymore.,WOGPRDT,d2anqis,6,t5_3d1h6

7337377,0,t1_d2c78sr,gtmany of the shaman cards are overstatted for their mana costs due to the overload effect so just playing a bunch of minions and evolving them wont be as good as it would be in other classes.Did you write that backwards? The Shaman minions are overstatted so Shaman is the best class to play this spell avoid paying overload costs. ,WOGPRDT,d2c7jpm,-2,t5_3d1h6
