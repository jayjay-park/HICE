11310995,0,t3_61fj9s,gt BINGO!!! You get it!! In order for this game to improve and move forward they really need to evolve. Cut all these complex dance moves and rotations bullshit and stick to core combos and abilities. The challenge is not memory game but general knowledge of battle mechanics and boss abilities understanding the universal battle sign language and knowing what it means as well as knowing which one of your abilities can be used to minimize damage or perform a well timed counter as tank to further minimize or negate the damage.,shitffxivsays,dfe313b,2,t5_3jp0o
