I am LOVING the guest appearances  its like a stroll through memory lane...  ...and Taraji my God Taraji is a GODDESS NSFWish you know the scene! Not surprised that this is getting overlooked by the television subreddit but who cares Im loving this show.,EmpireTV,coiw4jm,16,t5_325qt
3277400,0,t3_2x66dh,To be honest I dont know why Lucious is surprised by Jamal coming out in the most badass way possible.

3303068,0,t1_cp4rr93,Omg I know right? The brotherly bonds are one of my favorite things about this show.In a way I feel like Lucious is the bad guy in this show.

3474600,0,t3_301tfr,I know its difficult for a TV show to get the music part done right but when the characters start bumping to songs that wouldnt come close to being a hit in the real world I find it hard to believe the show. But I really want the show to go big so they can hire better music producers. Maybe future seasons after the show has a bigger budget will have a higher quality of music. Were already seeing some guest appearances from well known rappers and it would be awesome to see more. ,EmpireTV,cpobvut,7,t5_325qt

11002775,0,t1_dajwhfd,I guess its not for me I finished the first season the other day and I did kind of like it to begin with but its story is god awful. The music is also repetitive and fairly shit in terms of hiphop.,EmpireTV,def4sbs,1,t5_325qt
