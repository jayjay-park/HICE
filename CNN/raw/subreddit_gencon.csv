Well be returning next year were vacationing in Greece this year otherwise we would have gone.There are lots of activities for kids. If your son likes DampD Id recommend checking out the Pathfinder for Beginners I think thats what it was called series of games. Theyre intended for kids parents play with them and introduce them to Pathfinder and some basic adventures. Last year there were  different games you could sign up for. The kids got a token for a prize at the Pathfinder pavilion they could redeem later.Also fun were the giant sized board games like Catan. The kids loved rolling the giant dice and moving the giant pieces.Finally just walking the tradeshow floor is a real blast for the kids. So much to see!Time spent doing Gencon stuff was about  RPG  trade show floor and  board games giant and regular sized.Several friends also attended so there were times I left the girls and my wife at the hotel and went for more mature or later events with my gaming buddies.,gencon,cjbutrh,2,t5_2s0fr

3707789,0,t3_32ftzs,I really wish I had a bunch of folks with Generics show up for my Dragon Age RPG sessions. Half of them were overfull can you fit in my friendso? and the rest had only  or  show. I even had one game that was all noshows. Maybe because my games were only  hour intro style games. Maybe because I was in the farthest away room with zero foot traffic. Another thing to keep in mind that if a lot of things seem to sell out right away sometimes people DO back out and more tickets open up and also more games DO get added.

5837841,0,t3_3tmf4v,Others have had great advice.  I actually attended GenCon last year for my first time.  I worked a booth in the entreprenuer section.Bring a backpack full of water and snacks.  Thats what I survived on during the day and it was super helpful.  Staying hydrated is very important to avoiding ConCrud.  Plus you dont have to waste time finding waterfood during the day and focus on games.Regarding money and purchases  Do a little research on what you want before you go.  There are some things worth waiting in line for and others that arent.  Take Mysterium for example board game from Days of Wonder.  They only had a few hundred copies so you had to rush in early as possible to get in line.  People were buying them for  and then selling them for  at the show!  You can now buy it for  online.

7584634,0,t3_4j6ncm,My understanding is that the housing block is down to one hotel left so you may have to go outside the block to get a hotel. That will put you further away from the convention and possibly paying more for the room. Im not from Indianapolis so I cant comment on where would be a good place to stay sorry.If you havent bought your pass do it now then go look at the event listing. Event tickets go on sale Sunday and many will sell out quickly.Theres a spouses track of events for stuff thats sort of gamingadjacent. Those and the Entertainment track events can be good things to plan if youre worried about burning out on gaming events.If youre worried about con burnout in general you can totally leave the the convention hall area for a day and wander around Indy. Last year I went about a halfmile northeast of the hall for lunch and ran into a bicycle race that was going on. Indys a neat little city. If your sons not into gaming maybe see if theres something going on in the city that hes interested in? Metromix can help there though you might have wait until closer to the con for them to get all their events up.,gencon,d34c3of,1,t5_2s0fr

I assume someone is still there to tun organized play stuff but its a far cry from when they used to anchor the show.The first time I went to GenCon the WotC presence was kind of sad. They had a twostory booth with some sort of VIP lounge upstairs... But it was utterly unthemed for either DampD or Magic. They improved the next couple times I went. Last time I saw their booth they at least had a neat walkthrough area with a drider statue.Still the last few times I saw them at GenCon it was all about MtG or spinoffs like board games not DampD.,gencon,dcoa99g,4,t5_2s0fr
