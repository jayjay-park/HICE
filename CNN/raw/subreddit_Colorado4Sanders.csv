4693203,0,t1_ctm3706,Yeah I heard similar from someone who appeared to be pretty versed in the caucus process. I changed mine some time ago was registered Independent but this was more for our outreach efforts in talking to independents or republicans who may consider switching registrations to vote in the caucus.,Colorado4Sanders,ctm4bjk,2,t5_381b0

6615354,0,t3_469uso,yes i agree the timing is sort of strange however note the caucuses are managed completely by the parties so the county clerks do not notify for them id be interested to see what that postcard looks likeColorado has June primaries for all partisan races except presidential this includes various state and US Congressional seats that are open however top state offices such as governor are in evennumbered offyears from presidential elections most local elections are nonpartisan dont go through primaries and are in commonly in offyears from presidential elections however there is one exception  local District Attorney races are partisan and will go through a primary this year in Denver at least because the DA technically is a state position,Colorado4Sanders,d03l19w,2,t5_381b0
6683746,0,t1_d0amvdv,Yes I think you can. As long as you dont participate and are neutral I think you can volunteer to observe the caucus. ,Colorado4Sanders,d0anp06,3,t5_381b0

6988447,0,t1_d167f55,From El Paso county which had conventionassembly on March .  Go very early if you do not want to be in the line to register in the hour before they start. Consider bringing reading material phone music player. Assume it will have some parts which are boring frustrating annoying etc.  There are probably going to be some exciting and memorable parts too but be prepared for it to take several hours more than anyone in the room thinks it should. Dont go there to be negative towards the other candidate or their supporters.  Be respectful of everyone there. My advice  Decide ahead of time what you are prepared to do or put up with like for example be there  more hours than you expected and try to participate to get through the conventionassembly process successfully.  If the chairperson isnt fully onboard with your candidate but the rules and process are mostly democratic consider complimenting her on her volunteer work and her tasteful attire before jumping to the conclusion that shes a tyrant and should be yelled at.  Good luck have fun.  ,Colorado4Sanders,d18hcq2,2,t5_381b0
6992269,0,t1_d18m8ph,Im curious what you or others would suggest that regular delegates and citizens review in the two reports.  Personally getting the information ahead of time would have been helpful to the individuals who did have legitimate concerns which they brought up during the convention or myself out of curiosity however in my opinion it would have been good to bring up any concerns with the county Dem volunteers before the convention i.e. start the conversation so the concern is not a surprise during the convention.  The people running the Springs convention had to discuss items with our parliamentarian a few times but they made a point of keeping things moving even when people got angry.  During the Springs conventionassembly the most controversial thing about the countys materials was the resolutions where some people wished to add items and others like me were worried we were somehow supposed to accept whatever resolutions were in the printed list.  Some of the resolutions collated from the precinct caucuses were great but others were vague and one bothered me  Change Colorado Dem caucuses to be open. I didnt see the decision made however I know we didnt vote on resolutions.  Our election of delegates and alternates was simply herding the candidates supporters into different areas and identifying who was interested in going to the CDstate events as delegate or alternate.  I think we elected everyone who wanted to go but the delegate election itself was perfunctory.  ,Colorado4Sanders,d18wzt7,1,t5_381b0

7113399,0,t1_d1l0gzs,Is it worth it for her to vote against Bernie if Bernie isnt going to win anyway? I personally am not complaining about Superdelegates until we are ahead in pledged. Otherwise it does not really matter. ,Colorado4Sanders,d1mp5en,1,t5_381b0
