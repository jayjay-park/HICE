5443749,0,t1_cw77yp0,It didnt seem melancholic and weepy no but it was similar in tune to Christmas Lights I think. Which is an awesome song Im going to listen to that again right now. Im also going to search more today and Ill update if I find it. Thanks for the guess!,ChristmasMusic,cw7hp5h,2,t5_2s7o7
