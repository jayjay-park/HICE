6793881,0,t3_48t1nb,Interesting! You definitely bring up some interesting points. I didnt have the Hidden Land and Buried Relic in mind at all when PSMD brought up the ancient past but since PSMD is meant to be the game that ties everything and everyone together it makes sense.But now it begs the question as to what happened to the humans in said ancient past...The Decrepit Lab was said to be built by humans...and since the player in Explorers was implied to be specifically from the PMD world from the start I guess that could mean that the PMD world used to be inhabited by both humans and Pokmon much like the main series games?... But then some cataclysmic event environmental conditions or boundaries of time and space either wiped them all out or sent them to a different world.Whether it was Dark Matter the laws of the universe that Hydreigon abided by so strictly or some strange effects of being in the PMD world for too long that wiped out all the humans is yet to be seen.In Gates Hydreigon says that humans who stay in the PMD world for too long end up causing a distortion that may very well wipe out everything...while in Explorers Palkia ends up believing the exact same thing until he looks into it and realizes the distortion the player makes is too small and insignificant to matter. Hydreigon himself is also disproven when the players friends still remember him despite the laws of the universe dictating they would forget him. But thanks to Palkias insight in Explorers maybe it wasnt the power of friendship that caused the cast of Gates to remember you but rather it was a complete misunderstanding because Hydreigon failed to properly read up on his Voice of Life How to Deal with Humans in Your World handbook.... Looking at this now I feel as if I stawmand this entire comment by almost changing the subject entirely. My bad! I do agree that hints of the ancient past are in fact morethanpresent in the other games. I really like your insight on Entercards and Ley Lines too!Maybe that image of Mew drawn in the Hidden Highlands could now be seen as foreshadowing for Super. xDOH! NOT TO MENTIONthe footrunes! In Explorers Grovyle and your partner call them that but in Super all the characters simply refer to it as ancient footshaped writing instead which is just a mouthful to say. The texts on the Hidden Highland are written in footrunes and Grovyle had done some studying on it to the point he could read it fluently! Apparently more studying than Mawile was able to do. This alone shows the PSMD writers might have taken more than just a few obvious cues from the past games when mentioning the ancient past.,MysteryDungeon,d0mdjzt,13,t5_2srkz

7259912,0,t1_d1zbbzv,Welp  Ive got people in all directions raining walls on me seems Im in the minority againBut what if you selected the answer and instead of the protagonist thinking everything before saying yeah ill say that he just said it? Like I chose what I wanted to say just say it gosh dang it!But he also helped support your partner and helped them grow strong. This is really really hard to believe when the protagonist says basically nothing to the partner. Like wheres all this support he gives? Where is that coming from?What was he supposed to do when he was being watched? Perhaps... tell someone? Look around a little bit? Ask a few people? I dont know at least something more than just thinking nothing of it and walking away.he did what any normal person would do if they felt like they were being watched but had no confirmation if they actually were. I forgive him the first time. And I guess I forgive him the second time too. But the third time  man! Learn from your mistakes!rather nitpicky I guess all my criticism is nitpicking then. After all I made an entire thread just for nitpicking looked at all the responses and saw that most are not nitpicks to my standards.He just lost his scarf! So did his partner! Not true. Your scarf is not lost until the postgame.The protagonist from Gates also began to feel hopeless when fighting the Bittercold Thats because it was literally the Winds of Despair smashing into his chest! And even then you dont ever say something like Ive lost everything  you only go to the extent of Im not sure if we can do this.You complain that almost everyone in Super is nearperfect False. I complain about a set of  characters not almost everyone. The protagonist is not in that set of  characters.Your Voidlands thing is pretty fair but MAN would the boss scene have been so much better if the camera could have went into the Voidlands and shown everyone cheering you and your partner on! Even if this refutes the whole Void Shadows thing it still seems like a better option to me because frankly I think if everyone could pull through in the Voidlands just to stand up for you that would be more powerful than maintaining the places status as a notgood place to be. I never really liked the Void Shadows concept anyway  they were only really there to make the sacrifice scene in Reversal Mountain make sense and even then that was a flawed scene due to how drawn out it was.Welp  too many walls,MysteryDungeon,d23efum,0,t5_2srkz

7442754,0,t3_4h7rvq,Nostalgia is simply a reminiscence of the past. People often exaggerate that past and claim you can only be nostalgic for experiences that occurred many years ago but thats not completely accurate to the definition of the word.It doesnt matter what age you are or how long its been since youve remembered or done something. You can feel nostalgic for anything really. I already feel nostalgic for Super Mystery Dungeon... The months I spent being hyped for it the night I bought it after a long day of class when it came out on November th the free time I earned getting to play through the story for the first time... It was great.Im nostalgic for all the other PMD games too of course and the other memories I remember associated with those as well. You should try those out sometime though the lowerquality soundfonts and gameplay features might be a bit jarring for you considering you started with the D games first.Id say you shouldnt hope to feel nostalgic for something though. Some of the greatest moments most people remember in life are the ones they dont expect too much out of.

There are no traps and the floors arent very long.Floors The enemy pokemon level raise by one per floor starting out at level . While the Pokemon are low level every room has become a monster house. However hppp restoring items are prevalent. It is all a mater of quick thinking and moving.Floor This set of floors adds  mechanics. Poison traps pepper the landscape like land mines. This level also is filled with poison types. Did I mention there are no pecha berries? The music also changes from a happy beat to a somber one. The monster houses have a respite durin this time.Floors This floor removes the monster house block. This floor is filled with avian types. Just as a reminder the floor level increase is still going. These birds all have powerful moves. The background music is a midi version of aces high by iron maiden.Floors These floors have no rune or reason to them. Tons of warp traps and random enemies. The music is psychedelic in nature. These are the item spawning floors which would be taken advantage of by the player.Floors Fire types roam on these floors. By this point there are no more item drops so I hope you brought some raust berries. If the player reaches this point there is a high likelihood of being struck down. Level  fire types are hard to kill. The music is some rage against the machine song in midi.Floors There are no Pokemon here and the floor is barren of traps. The weather is snowing. There is no music in the background accept an a key being played in a piano.Floor On the top of the mountain stands arceus. He challenges the player. Defeat me and you shall receive a great treasure. Get defeated and you shall perish!The battle begins! The music is the mother  porky? Boss battle music. This battle is close to impossible to win.

It would have made one of my favorite games even better but alas gotta have a happy ending and more Gotta catchem all attitudes prevents that kind of story arch from taking place. Oh well thats not gonna stop me from practically holding my friends at gunpoint to play it! Also youre probably right about In the hands of fate. Its been quite a few ingame hours between that and me finishing the game including a shameful week stuck on Dialga,MysteryDungeon,d45kwb3,3,t5_2srkz
8074161,0,t3_4pomx6,I really hope SMD isnt the last game in the series which would be rather sad since I can still see quite a bit of untapped potential in these games. But if there ever is another Mystery Dungeon game heres some of the biggest things Id like to see also prepare for a huge wall of text . More things to doDungeon crawling is fun and all but in my opinion it can start to feel rather boring and repetitive after a while even though the layouts change every time. Id like to have the option to do more things in between minigames perhaps? just to make things a bit more interesting and mix things up a little.. FIX THE PACING ISSUESThis is what killed SMD for me. The first half of the game was great and had me hooked for about a week but when I got to the second half I began to gradually lose interest in the game.spoilerss Granted the big twist with Nuzleaf was a real shocker but after the back to back to back boss battle at the top of Fire Island the game decides to throw in several more little plot twists as well as deciding to randomly spike the difficulty at points. At this point I couldnt help but feel that the game didnt know what it wanted to do with itself and was trying too hard to keep my attention. From what Ive heard this is an issue with a lot of the games so there might not be a lot of luck with this one but it would still be nice.. Less grindingForgive me if I sound like a filthy casual but if theres one thing I cant stand about RPGs its level grinding. I understand that some people find a great deal of satisfaction out of fighting enemy after enemy after enemy and slowly becoming stronger as time passes but in my opinion this is a huge pace killer and overall just a big waste of time. I dont play PMD because I want to spend hours fighting the same enemies over and over again just so I can become a little bit stronger. I play PMD because I want to immerse myself in a strange yet fantastic world make new friends and go on amazing adventures with them. But if I have to level grind just so that I feel like Im progressing through the game I may as well just throw my DS in the trash. Or maybe.... Make some subtle changes to the combat so that the game focuses less on numbers and statsWhat do I mean by this? First of all lets take a look at Undertales combat system I know everyone is sick and tired of hearing about this game but Im trying to prove a point. In Undertale you have a choice between sparing an enemy or killing them. Killing enemies is basically the same thing as in every other RPG bring their HP down to  get some experience level up wash rinse repeat. But if you want to spare an enemy you have to talk to them for a bit and dodge their attacks in a bullet hell minigame. Now heres what I like the most about this design choice the harder bosses dont simply rely on numbers or statistics in order for the player to beat them. Rather they focus more so on the players actual skills and abilities. This means that the game can still be entertaining for players who may not like level grinding like me while being challenging enough so that the player isnt bored out of their mind fighting the same enemies again and again. Now Im not saying that PMD should be EXACTLY like this although I admit that would be rather interesting. What I AM saying is that there should at least be some subtle changes to the combat so that its not just the usual taking turns smacking enemies in the face that has the potential to become stale after a while. What those changes are I honestly have no clue but if theres a way to pull it off and do it well then Im all for it.And finally.... More maturityAlright I get that these are supposed to be kids games and all but when you really think about it the majority of players that started off with these games when they were about    years old are just about ready to enter adulthood by this point myself included. I doubt it would happen but Id at least like to see some more mature dialogue or dialogue that isnt so cringeworthy and cheesy. Also this may sound utterly ridiculous but if Spike Chunsoft really wants to impress me Id like to see this series take a much darker turn than what weve already come to expect. And I dont just mean darker than EoS and GtI. Im talking Mother  dark. Now I know what youre probably thinking. But PMD is already notoriously dark for a Pokmon game! and youre right hell these games have even managed to make people cry at some points. But the problem is that some of the older players or the ones like me that just got into PMD may not feel the same way as someone who played these games back in th grade. Can you imagine how much more impactful and emotionally moving PMD would be if it treaded into the same waters as Mother ? I dont know about you but Id love to see something like that. Sorry for the huge wall of text. This has been stewing inside my head for a long time and I havent really found a place to let it all out. Also if this sounds like a little too much to ask for it probably is. I seriously doubt any of the stuff I listed above would actually make it into an official PMD game but hey. A guy can dream cant he? Who knows? Maybe well see something like this in a fangame sometime down the line if there ever is one.,MysteryDungeon,d4nm15j,8,t5_2srkz

8377295,0,t3_4ubit9,Eh undertale and PMD are two very different games and I prefer PMDs because undertale has no variety in attacks I have replayed the game since I finished it did both the big runs because I knew exactly what I would do and the enemys would do and I couldnt change anything like in other rpgs for my character so it felt like a chore to play meanwhile PMD is different every time and I can change my movesets and party and even the dungeons are random so its never the same and its how Ive played Eos more times that I can count and am on like my th time playing super Next I agree the story of undertake is written fantasticly but I fail to see how that goes with PMD being childish besides Its kinda charming especially since they do tackle a lot of mature themes with it and do it very well for being written childish the games are dark and meaningfulI think it would be better to compare it to kingdom hearts that series does the same thing it does with mostly childish writting but tells a very dark tale that presents a lot of complex adult themes and when I think kh does a better job at making the themes unique and stand out but I mean square writters vs chunsoft kinda hard for them to beat square there they do a fantastic job,MysteryDungeon,d5oplw8,4,t5_2srkz

Granted in most PMD games the fact that the Hero has amnesia is a major plot point in one way or another as the cause of their amnesia relates to whatever problem is going on whether directly or indirectly. But it is still nice to have a Hero who doesnt have amnesia for a change of pace especially since the plot does not need it at all. ,MysteryDungeon,d63t59b,6,t5_2srkz

8897886,0,t1_d7du54x,I just thought of this but I think a huge reason why Riolu is such a common main character is Skys fault. The people who played Time  Darkness would naturally want to pick something new when starting up Sky so Riolu is an obvious pick  It was added just for Sky so you feel like youre getting your moneys worth. Also it has interesting typing because Time  Darkness didnt have a fighting   type starter and your previous starters statistically would have been fire water or grass. So all things considered Riolu offers some muchneeded variety and unless youre a Pikachu fan so does Shinx for the exact same reasons.And then it follows that if youre hyped enough to write a fanfic youre probably going to write it about the characters you played the game with. Source my Sky team was Riolu  Shinx for these exact reasons.,MysteryDungeon,d7hecvo,3,t5_2srkz

9492176,0,t3_5at9i3,That is one of the more heartwarming yet missable moments. If you play through the game and talk to every NPC like I do you constantly see Team Tasty and hear about Wurmples fears of being eaten. This goes on through most of the game with Wurmple to afraid to actually ask hisher dont really know leader about it. What breaks it?spoilerss Seeing how strong the Hero and Partner are acting despite the fact that they had to say goodbye to a child they raised for that childs own good.The next event day if you go to the beach an area that youre probably not typically going to go because NPCs arent normally there though with the possibility of bottles you might go there more in Sky. But by going there you can see those two have a heart to heart and its really heartwarming. Its especially nice as a breather between spoilers s the Manaphy event and Darkrai coming into the plot.

10052418,0,t1_dbhngiu,Making construction of the base a big part of the story could be really cool. It could certainly be a different direction to take the series. Instead of joining a guild or some organization or whatever you take charge and find your own way in this new world you find yourself in eventually creating this whole organization that fights for what they believe in rather than the stupid whims of guilds and shadow groups pulling the strings. And you have to deal with the consequences of this as those other organizations probably arent going to support you not pledging your allegiance to them and may even try to shut you down. But Im thinking if building this base is going to be story centric it needs to be really big and give off the vibe of an actual headquarters rather than a few shacks and mini farms here and there like Paradise. Something to say This is my base. It isnt yours it isnt some guilds it isnt natures. Its mine. I want an artificial island like that one in Superman Returns or something like an oil platform or whatever. Gates did have some good ideas however. Its an excellent starting point for how things should be done. Maybe some of the upgrades could be facilities like in Gates to give upgrades supplies minigames etc. And of course you could populate the base with teammembers as well like in Gates. Just could attach balloons or something to enemies to send them back to base and join your team. And you know what? Lets aim for the stars since we might end up on Switch. Lets add multiplayer. Let players raid each others bases to steal members or supplies or whatever. That could be fun once you completed the game and have nothing better to do. ,MysteryDungeon,dbhut02,3,t5_2srkz
