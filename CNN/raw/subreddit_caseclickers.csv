6662693,0,t3_3lstic,Automatically adjusting prices for the skins would be pretty cool.

6662908,0,t3_46vqjn,Really if you start imo you shouldnt already unlock those betting and jackpot things because its basically a big money waste. Moste people dont get it because if they once have a high tier inventory with like  worth of items they dont care about  or even . But you dont have the money to play those without loosing massive yet. So unlock upgrades that help you with clicking the more knivesmore stat trak upgrades bwtter rank and start trading first. I recommend starting to play jackpots or bet not before you have at least  in skins I started when I had like  i think. Because if you start now you will have to put in a massive amount of your skins and will become absolutely mad as soon as you loose which will be very quick. Just my opinion. Think about it yourself but thats how I did it and Im pretty ok with my inventory D,caseclickers,d08i2wc,1,t5_39vx5

8724281,0,t1_d6tq9mu,Crypton i have found a kind of glitch... So for example if you have an older version of the game and you join an online jackpot and nobody can join because you are not connected to the servers i think the timer just restarts over and over again and you can not exit because you will lose you items... I lost a souvenir fn dlore and an st fn karambit tiger tooth like this and some cheaper skins. Pls try to fix this,caseclickers,d6w6dcj,1,t5_39vx5
