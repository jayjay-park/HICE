2265937,0,t1_clrrcm3,Do you know if theres anything like a free therapist meetandgreet? Im sure it will take me some time to find one that I connect with and if theres a way I could even start that process in a small way now I think it would help me out.,Invisible,clrsfr4,1,t5_2rls5

7593935,0,t3_4j90st,Hey there Your story sounds quite similar to mine! Shit started to hit the fan when I was in high school and has kind of progressed till now currently . Most of my family are very understanding but there are a few people who sound similiar to your brother. Just like its hard for our family members to understand where were coming from I think it can sometimes be hard for us to understand where theyre coming from. For example my dad has never said I was faking symptoms but says a lot of the things your brother does and frequently tries to negate how much illness really affects my life. It wasnt until recently that I figured out he doesnt want to have to come to terms with how shitty and difficult his little girls life really is. Instead of coming to terms with the fact that hes got a disabled daughter the way he copes is by making my symptoms out to be way less than they are. Siblings are a whole nother ball game. My brother and I have gone through some rough patches because he was basically jealous of all the attention I was getting. All conversations began with how has PunkMcKickass been? Family sent get well or thinking of you cards but never anything to him. It can definitely be a tough adjustment for a lot of siblings. My guess is your brother has a combination of these two things going on. Im not sure what to do with that information but a lot of times just understanding the problem can make it more easily tolerated. Best of luck!,Invisible,d35e4ol,3,t5_2rls5

10722520,0,t1_ddlsi05,This is the first way I like to go about things. The second is me having a very loud audible conversation with said assholes OPs post spoke of. During which you openly challenge their ability to judge your health condition. Say It Out Loud. Some wide open honesty will shock them then you publicly dismiss them or let themselves run enough rope to hang themselves all while in GLORIOUS PUBLIC.Think of ever time you felt negative about your health condition let it sharpen you. Now flash that sharpened edge as I said. That is how I got over and past this type of thing. And kept living normal the longest.Just dont sharpen all things that make you YOU. Cause the years will pass and they will give you growth. And finally this shit wont be happening so often to where you wont have a clear memory of the last time such happened. For me I realized it hasnt happened in a good long time upon reading your post.,Invisible,ddly5rl,5,t5_2rls5
