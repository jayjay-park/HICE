9705999,0,t3_4p4o3j,I dont think it was wrong she was silently pushed out the show... Remember Sammy and Sarah and there was another female I cant remember. Like there is some fishiness with Kane apparently. Dani cant talk openly about anything probz cause of a NDA but I think this was her way of saying Kane isnt good... This is coming from someone that was listening like  mins ago to the show lol,TheKaneShow,da9h0pa,1,t5_30wb8
