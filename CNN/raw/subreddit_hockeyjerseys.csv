3077871,0,t1_cogscjz,I cant agree more! I actually love that add. I feel like buying a counterfeit jersey isnt stealing the jersey per se but more like buying a Tony brand TV instead of a Sony. You are buying a cheap knock off. Companies have every right to protect their ideas and I absolutely respect that. To me it just seems unfair to take advantage of consumers. Its like if you go to an art gallery. This painting is worth  and its completely white with a small duck or something. Its his duck painting and he can charge whatever he wants and not everyone can afford nor wants it. But if Walmart starts selling duck paintings for ....you do the mathLets use another great example baseball cards. If you are over  and liked sports you collected baseball cards as a kid. I remember dropping my whole allowance on them. You used to be able to get a pack of like  cards for a dollar. I remember when I was about  or so it was  for  cards and every card was a winner! I just couldnt afford to drop that kind of cash for a measly  cards and ever pack was exactly the same. The hobby of baseball card collecting kind of died. They took advantage of consumers and it ruined their business. Not saying that hockey jerseys will go obsolete because that would be absurd. I warn the manufacturers to make a product that the masses can afford. I agree jerseys should be all the same price. No reason why Sidney Crosbys or Patrick Kanes jersey should cost more than a Shane Doan jersey no offense to any Shane Doan fans. They would probably sell a few more jerseys that way but still. Dont even get me started with ticket prices. ,hockeyjerseys,coh0ons,2,t5_2tvot

It would be a quick sig and maybe not look the best but the jersey was cheap enough that I didnt care.Instead he ended up doing a signing at the free Fan Day at Joe Louis Arena last night so I brought it there and it was a sitdown signing at a table so it came out really nice.I also asked him to add  points since Florida was his last team and he reached his final total of  points wearing a Panthers CCM jersey.Also at the event Ted Lindsay made an appearance so I brought my photo of him playing for the St Micheals Majors in  the year before his rookie season with the Wings.

The black stripes should be visible from both the outside and inside of the newer edge jerseys. Maybe that was one of the changes from edge . to edge . but I find it suspicious. Edit also the fabric of the white with black stripes bottom part seem to be off. Again Im basing of an edge . and this is probably being sold as an edge ..

7790645,0,t3_4m1237,I dont want to say a Maska will never be faked but itd have to be really really rare. Thats one of the pluses to collecting preReebok jerseys aside from generally higher quality of replicas the market isnt flooded with fakes. Unless its really obviously a knockoff Id feel confident buying almost any pre jersey. You should be more worried about condition than anything. Lot of people throw these things in the washerdryer and the crests get all bubbly and gross.I remember inadvertently melting the stupid heat press vinyl numbers on my Hasek jersey because I dried it on high heat. It came out as a big glob of jersey and vinyl. You couldnt even pull it apart and reshape it into a jersey.

Not a lot of money in that.At first blush it looks like a standard premier jersey. Not the best customization job probably from NHL.com or thereabouts. But I dont see anything that screams fake.

10303163,0,t3_5njh20,I prefer my jerseys to fit well like a jersey  loose. With that said theres quite a bit of difference in jerseys I have from the same year set on some game worns. For example I have a couple of  Sharks jerseys that are size  and one is definitely bigger than the other. Its a small difference I guess but I can tell it fits differently. I also have a couple of Edge authentics in a size  which is comfortably loose for me and would be the size Id probably buy if I were buying something off the shelf and again one of those is bigger than the other. I have an older Koho thats a  that swallows me whole the same as a Nike  that fits like a tent. I have some older CCM authentics in a size  that fit just about perfectly so I dont get where anyone thinks they fit smaller than the Edge jerseys because Ive never found that to be the case even though Ive seen several people say that on here. Also on the older CCM sweaters the air knit jerseys seem to fit a little differently than the ultrafil jerseys.I say all that to say that I think theres just sizing variations from sweater to sweater and thats just part of making clothing.,hockeyjerseys,dcbx38b,2,t5_2tvot

11446680,0,t3_63ebna,Haha funny story  when the World Cup of hockey was in Toronto in  last one before they revitalized it i was staying in Toronto to see the CanadaRussia game. We were at the same hotel as the Russian players. A bunch of autograph seekers were in the lobby and scrummed a guy coming down off the elevator. Turns out it was Darius haha. A bunch of the guys had loose jersey number for the players to sign to them sew onto jerseys to make them autographed jerseys of course and one guy said Darius can you sign your number?. And Darius autographed the number with just his number not name and walked away laughing. Then got into a Lamborghini or Porsche or something with a super model and drove off. Amazing.,hockeyjerseys,dftgz1f,7,t5_2tvot
