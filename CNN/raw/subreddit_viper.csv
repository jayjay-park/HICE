The road you are going down to fix up a salvage viper is ridiculously expensive. The viper is a low numbers car with a unique engine unlike say a vette that there are tens or hundred of thousands of and has an lsx engine with even more options. I just swapped in a ported top end and a big brake kit and spent k and all the engine bits were used and thats without a custom tune. Just chill good things come to those who wait I bought mine at  but I did so in cash after I was married and owned a house. At  I was counting change for dinner off the dollar menu... Things can change rather quickly just be patient and work hard and dont try to live too fast. Waiting also makes what you achieve so much sweeter.,viper,clh5y5j,1,t5_31vaa
