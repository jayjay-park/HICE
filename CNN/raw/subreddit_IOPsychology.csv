At first we were not sending any and then leadership changed their mind and offered a .k stipend to attend. By this point I had turned down  panels and I honestly dont want to spend  hours traveling each way to go to a conference for  days so I am not going. I know several people at DDI and they are sending fewer people as well and only sending those that have presentations. I think its similar at most of the consulting firms. One of my coworkers is in charge of the Masters Consurtium this year and I know she is saying the  of nominations and RSVPs this year is way down from last year to the point where they are combining the PhD and the masters consurtium this year.

They dont understand psychological data and because they are purely data miners they end up with all kinds of conclusions that dont really represent the data accurately.  I caught one presentation where they dissected a likert question into categories using chisquare and then used that  response on the likert scale as groups and talked about how they responded to other items.

3858234,0,t1_cqvpq6j,gt Is it not common practice to hang on to data sets?I think Walumbwa is being completely shady and Im not making any apologies for him. You can reverseengineer the results reported in his articles and determine that the fit indices hes reporting are totally made up. However I do think its worth pointing out that very few people worried about keeping data and materials in the long run prior to the Stapel retractions and the ongoing replication crisis in applied psych. The old APA recommendation was to be able to provide your materials for five years postpublication but it was so unlikely that anyone would ask for them that few people really bothered to archive carefully. Journals certainly never asked people to submit their data for public access. Basically unless someone was doing a meta published data was dead and not worth the clutter to many people. It was also much harder to safeguard against accidental loss even just a decade ago today you can get a dirtcheap  TB local drive and back up with cloud storage for free but no one had anything like that until recently. I remember an old  MB USB drive that was my backup for my entire life in grad school... When people moved schools closed email accounts or experienced a laptop disaster a lot of work got lost. I no longer have the data from a key study in one of my best publications because my laptop bag containing both my laptop and my USB drive was stolen and never recovered. Again not making excuses but I think its worth bringing this up to a new generation of researchers who are coming out of school in a postStapel mindset. I think its a GREAT change to the field but just realize that a failure to produce data doesnt always imply scientific fraud especially for older publications. It was a dumber and simpler time. ,IOPsychology,cqw2o5g,3,t5_2sl29

6779661,0,t3_48l95k,gtThe response invariably has something to do with whether we can even measure things like commitment satisfaction wellbeing etc. One persons  is another persons  and everyone has different standards and expectations for satisfactionYou might want to point out that this subjectivity is kind of the point. Everyone does have different standards and expectations for satisfaction. The same conditions that might make one person extremely satisfied  can make another person only slightly satisfied . Attitudes will vary between and even within people so noise in the measurement isnt necessarily measurement error the way that your students are thinking about it. Genuine problems with measuring attitudes arise as a consequence of the instrument. For example if the scale points are anchored with vague labels or ambiguous descriptions then you do have a problem because people are likely to interpret the question and response options differently. Piloting and good survey design can go a long way toward addressing these problems. ,IOPsychology,d0krbkm,6,t5_2sl29
7017278,0,t3_4bnrp0,Im not sure how much you know about college but as a first generation college graduate I really wish someone had told me some basic things that everyone typically assumes you know. If you want to pursue a doctorate it will be extremely advantageous for you to start volunteering for research right away in college. Also if you can start a part time job somewhere that will give you a start on experience in the consulting field. Even a basic job in Human Resources. Volunteer if you have to. Just get experience. Continue building your vocabulary with apps games books whatever you can find to maximize your vocabulary score on the GRE. Also begin checking into what colleges even offer a degree in IO. I found out no where in my area even offers this degree and if youre not willing to relocate or take an online degree you may need to consider another path. Also check into the financial aid of the college the university here offers fellowships to students of good academic standing and they also offer teaching assistant positions that pay your tuition about  month stipend and health insurance.

8110706,0,t1_d4rl3xx,Great questions.  I think differentiating between a research assistantship where you support a grant or a contract and consulting as an graduate student is an important distinction to make.  ampnbsp  I do think USF is unique in our role as Volunteer Program Assessment VPA affiliate university.  So we do have the opportunity for graduate students to serve in that forward facing role where you actually interact with the client as a consultant.  Ive also been blessed in that my research assistantship was also a client facing position too.  That said I have some friends across a few programs with similar opportunities.  ampnbsp  OMG there are SO MANY challenges to working with clients as a grad student.  I think the biggest one is a twoparter first demonstrating to the client you are an expert.  I know for me I have a serious case of babyface so a lot of the rapport building is focused on demonstrating expertise to the client to get over that immediately.  Honestly its not that big a deal but it can derail you if youre not prepared to address it or dont nip it in the bud.  So take for example this most recent project with the police department.  Myself  and another student ish? are speaking with officers twice are age and about as much tenure as weve been alive.  We definitely considered what it must look like to have a couple kids really come in and provide recommendations.  I have some smallunit leadership experience from time in the military so I can usually talk about that in the rapport building phase.  Also simply being professional looking the part aaaaand a little faking it til you make it with respect to confidence.  Which leads me to the second part convincing yourself you are an expert.  Whether you are an IO Ph.D. OBHR whatever you know A LOT even in your first year.  That may just be me speaking from a lot of impostor syndrome during my first year when I started VPA but I didnt realize how much I already knew until it came time to use it.  ampnbsp  Honorable mention for challenges communicating results to people who dont speak correlations.  Practice it learn different visualizations learn to communicate results in bar graphs and anecdotes to supplement that great stat background we all have as IO psychologists.  I absolutely love the great stat training IOs receive but IMHO I think that can sometimes be a crutch because at least in graduate school were always talking to people who speak that same language.  To give an example I worked on the same project two years in a row.  The first year the client was also a psychologist I gave this person results in correlations matrices we didnt need to say much else.  The next year someone else took over.  Very smart and capable person doesnt speak the same language which is fine I just had to go the extra mile by providing more graphs and visuals to deliver the same message.  ampnbsp  I went a little tangential there but if you have any other questions Id be happy to followup in this thread or via DM!  ampnbsp  Edit Amazing username BTW,IOPsychology,d4rpswv,3,t5_2sl29
