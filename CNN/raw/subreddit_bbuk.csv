1284724,0,t3_28rcrd,I think Toya might be in danger if she goes up her perception seems to be really negative with a certain amount of people. Shed have to show some positives this week.    I dont think Winston or Chris is in any danger at all.    I dont know what to think about Ash. He seems popular enough but people hate Helen soooooo much and I think will go after the people shes aligned with ie Ash and Steven.    Edit Now that Ive watched it two words  HURRICANE TOYA. I understand why she snapped quickly and told them all to calm the fuck down she was stressed and prepped for a fight and spoke harsher than maybe she meant but it could NOT have been a worse time to have poor tone and phrasing. The guys had just been put on the defensive by finding out they were up and discarded her need to address everything instantly and make large announcements really bit her in the ass.   Bet Matthew wanted to crawl into a hole and die throughout that entire thing he would have had MUCH better management over the whole thing if hed been solo.,bbuk,cie5c60,2,t5_2u8h1

She acted like she was on a different planet basically and Jack said something about the situation being mental. I heard him call Nikki mental between the lines and I doubt hes taking her very seriously. He could just be kissing ass to avoid nomination.But Nikki did make me chuckle in the DR talking about her lies spiraling out of control.

I think it will benefit Nick massively as well hell get to be free from Harry and more funloving. Ive really liked him over the past few days. Not too sure why but I really liked how spent k for a pass to the final putting Chloe up. Possibly because he showed everyone that after all its a game and HE wants to make it to the final and he didnt care if people thought it was backstabbing or whatever. Might be wishful thinking but I think Nick will do really well. Either winning it or in the top . ,bbuk,csvsfya,2,t5_2u8h1

Smelled blood isolated her and went in for the kill rather than sorting it out.The Darren thing was not lame. He was saying Darren had an addiction problem and had relapsed not recovered and if Darren hadnt jumped in to clarify it implied hed turned back to drink or would do. It was a lowblow to someone whod gone in the house to show people theyd changed and straight after John had a oneonone talk with him saying to relax not worry and be himself!He was also one of the only  people to know Angies reason for staying which was that shes didnt want to face the press but nominated her and said she should go anyway.I honestly have no idea why you like the man at this point he gets off on playing with people because he thinks hes better than everyone.,bbuk,cz07dyn,8,t5_2u8h1
