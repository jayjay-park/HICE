6347699,0,t3_42kusb,Sounds wonderful! I wish a small independent cinema near me would play the movie on a big screen again. I did get to see Labyrinth at the cinema all those years ago and it was magical. I loved Jim Henson fantasy and Bowie and Labyrinth to me was brilliant. It was exciting for me to introduce my children to it and they all love it too.My eldest bought me a Babe with the Power tshirt proud mum lol Its a movie that will be around for a long time. ,labyrinth,czb5v25,1,t5_2sg98
