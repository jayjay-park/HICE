68571,0,t1_cem7swc,I dont think so.  At least not what we saw  learned of Rush.  Baltar had some pretty unique characteristics.  Personalitywise he was a selfcentered egomaniac.  Baltar was in it to get people to acknowledge him as better.  Everything he did was not about proving to himself that he was good but being able to say Hey!  Everyone! Look how great I am!  Im way better than you!  Baltar was constantly afraid that someone somewhere was going to call him out on being a tiny little man.  He was constantly afraid.Rush was far more confident.  He knew he was better than most people.  He knew he was smarter.  It wasnt a matter of proving it or doing things to demonstrate how much better he was.  He didnt need to.  Rushs asshole nature stemmed from constantly having to deal with all these inferior people interrupting him as hes finally found a challenge that he feels is worthy of his abilities.  Rush also begrudgingly grants Eli some bit of respect not as an equal  hed never admit that anyone is his equal  but ranked second.  Baltar was also easily manipulated.  I mean shit look at the first episode of BSG.  Baltar was constantly trying to stay one step ahead of being found out.  Rush was usually the one doing the manipulating or trying to.  And when he was found out Rush just did the Yeah?  Whachyagonnadobout it?thing.The only real thing they have in common is being The Really Smart Science Guy.  ,Stargate,cem8if9,2,t5_2qhar

154869,0,t3_1vuqqk,One that bothers me goes as far back as the original movie.  There are  chevrons for location and the th for origin.  Why do we need to dial a chevron for origin since the gate you are dialing from is not supposed to be moved.  Basically why didnt the ancients program the DHD to automatically add the th chevron to a  chevron dialing sequence so that the th chevron doesnt even need to be dialed.    In the same respect if the chevrons correlate to constellations to essentially triangulate the location of the planet with the stargate what possible constellation could we use for an th chevron to dial pegasus? Considering the fact that the ancients only ever really traveled from pegasus to milky way and back I guess maybe one of the many chevrons is specifically for pegasus... ok... but what about the  chevron address for destiny? If the th chevron indicates galaxy and the th chevron is specific for destiny which isnt in a set galaxy then we dont need the th chevron. We still need a buttload of power but the respective th galaxy chevron is not necessary the th destiny chevron would take its place.    Basically I think its a bit cheesy to say oh lets add another chevron to the dialing sequence to open up a whole new saga.  ,Stargate,cew2kk3,9,t5_2qhar

1235306,0,t3_2876vk,i dont know if this will help you or not but Ive spent a fair bit of time in the SGC picking various brains.So the question is how does the Stargate know when to close?First thing we need to understand is how does the Stargate work.Two rings made of naquada supercapactior in the traditional form though Orlins wasnt. These rings are the end points of a wormhole artificially generated between them. Now a traditional Stargate is powered by the DHD. So press the symbols power is sent to the gate and a wormhole is established. At that point that wormhole is powered by the gate that dialled. So thats the normal setup. When the wormhole is no longer in use it closes radio travellers. However there are other ways to dial gates. Puddle Jumpers do it Wraith darts do it Guauld wristbands do it etc. These dialing devices do not power the gate. They rely on the superconducting material to retain a charge from its last use more on that later and the gate that dials transfers responsibility for powering the wormhole to the recipient gate. This is the important bit if you dont have enough power at the dialling end you can make the receiving gate power the wormhole. Initially a small connection is made between the two gates and then the power transfer begins forcing open the full wormhole. This is how SG escape from a prison planet with a plant or dialled with a truck in the s. This also charges up the dialling gate for a future use that was the more bit. This is also how Orlin was able to build a gate from toasters and make a connection even though he didnt have a nuclear power plant at hand. He made a smaller connection then drew power from the receiving gate.And now we come to Earths gate and Atlantis and a few other gates managed by various advanced species Asgard Asurians. These races have created their own DHD devices and are heavily integrated into gate functions. Basically when receiving an inbound wormhole they automagically instruct the sending gate to stop powering the wormhole and take over that role. That allows the gate to be shutdown at near will. This is how ONeil in the first season could cut the top off someones head by turning of the gate with their head midway past the event horizon. Normal gates wouldnt allow that but Earth has their own DHD and have bypassed safety protocols.With skill and cunning attackers can force power through and maintain the wormhole but that requires dedicated tech and power that most races dont have handy. Anyways the TLDR is depending on who controls the power for the wormhole not always the sending gate they decide when to shut it down. edit a word,Stargate,ci8l78d,3,t5_2qhar

IMO the molten iriskawoosh pocket debacle was explained enough to satisfy my suspension of disbelief. Additionally I would think that the density of the matter within the plane of the event horizon is a factor here considering you can establish a wormhole while a gate is partially or wholly submerged. Not sure if the presence of water is enough to nullify the kawoosh or not. Ill have to go back and watch the one with Marina Sirtis again.EDIT Watergate was no help.

2396058,0,t3_2muzsm,Well I have a feeling you would die. Now we know you can keep an open wormhole active from the other side the receiving end by sticking a part of your body through it like an arm for example which will prevent the wormhole from closing. We also know from what the show told us that the Stargate transmits information in discreet packets  so it needs to have a complete discreet block of matter like your entire body enter through the event horizon entirely before it can be transported.So if you enter the gate from the receiving end what happens? Well there was one episode I recall where they sent a MALP through I think it was the one were ONeill was trapped on the planet for several months after the meteorite hit the gate and buried it facing upwards and the MALP the SGC sent to check things out passed through the gate then because the gate was not standing up but was laying down the MALP fell back through the event horizon and Carter in the SGC monitoring the transmission declared that the MALP was destroyed because of that. In fact in that episode I mentioned above you might recall that Tealc went through the horizontal underground gate entering into the void created by the Kawoosh to try to dig his way to the surface to rescue ONeill and Tealc had to use a rope gun to fix himself to the ceiling of the chamber to ensure he did not fall back down through the receiving ends event horizon.From that evidence I am gonna assume that bad things happen if you go backwards through the event horizon on a gates receiving end.   ,Stargate,cm7uzbq,25,t5_2qhar

They left atlantis without jumpers or ships waiting on the other end on foot and emerged in egypt bc if they emerged in antarctica they wouldnt have to make there way there and if they had a ship waiting it wouldnt be a big enough deal to mention making their way down there. And since they didnt pop out in antarctica ra had to have been there. But then there werent just a few of them evacuating back to egypt there were dozens. So either ra wasnt looking or they fought him off just started walking.

2843354,0,t3_2snk25,Daniel had some discussions about the parallels between Origin and Christianity also making note of some clear differences between the two. It does look like the concept of Christianity was very Ancient in origin only it was made clear that certain things were evil such as fire in contrast with Origin which revered itSeeing as the Ancients had a pretty strict noninterference policy I dont think any Ancient would have been allowed to knowingly create a religion like that. So I have two possible theories about this An Ancient calling himself the God of Humans created the religion in an attempt to fight the Oris potential influence but he was stopped by the others. This would mean all subsequent actions were purely done by the Humans without Ancient influence Some Ancients spread some propaganda to reduce the threat of the Ori in our galaxy which evolved into modern Christianity.Regarding the first theory the Ancients have always been portrayed as strongly scientificoriented. Personally I think even the Ancients we met who disagreed with the noninterference policy would not pose as God to that degree. This was the key differentiation between them and the Ori to begin with. While this doesnt rule out the possibility I realize Oma DEFINITELY skirted that line with her mother nature bit I think it does seem unlikely.The second theory seems more likely to me. If Merlin was allowed to run around doing what he did then certainly someone could have spread some propaganda that got out of control.If either of these theories are correct I think the end result would be the same The Ancient who was behind it would fade out from history and we wouldnt hear about himher again Especially after creating a halfAncient baby they way the Ori created Adria and trying to correct Humanitys interpretations of the religion. But that would be why we havent heard anything about it in the show.,Stargate,cnrad1n,3,t5_2qhar

2866015,0,t3_2sxivl,The Destiny amp Seed Ship Stargates are of older construction. All of them have a pedestal attached to it so I think that the pedestal could be a folded fairing a hard shell for the Stargate which would deploy after the gates hit the ground.For Milky Way  Pegasus Stargates these gates are more advanced and their range is far superior  possibly due to DHD mainly. I think they planted the nd and rd generation of gates with manual labor possibly with a small ship carrying them and gently dropping them andor lowering them.Beaming them down... well neither Destiny nor Seed ships have beaming technology. st generation beaming technology requires rings nd generation beaming technology of Ancients can beam stuff between designated roomsareas. rd generation Merlins teleporter must have been invented after by Merlin after he descended down. Even if ring transporters were available to them a small ship must have been dispatched to the planet.As far as I can tell Ancients never invented before Merlin that is any beaming technology that could work like Asgard beaming technology which works remotely. Thats why I think they mustve planted them manually. ,Stargate,cntv7kz,2,t5_2qhar

3198089,0,t1_cotf36v,To addOne of my personal rules for a television romance If a main character cares about a guest character romantically then the guest character better be special enough to exist outside of the romance. This is the Pete dilemma. To Sams personal story its important that the relationship start and exist somewhat outside of Stargate Command. After all thats kind of the point and step Sam wants to take. However this makes it very difficult for Pete to have reason to exist on the show outside of Sam. Perhaps Pete could have been woven into Cassandras story. Introducing a character in her life would make sense considering Dr. Fraisers death shorty after Petes introduction.In the end we get the richness of Sams joy romantic struggles and growth but without a strong partner for her to experience it with. I dont hate Pete. I dont really like Pete either. Its strange. He does the job of serving Sams character but could have done better serving the show.Sometimes romantic side stories can be irksome in science fiction or a lot of genres for that matter. Jack Daniel and Tealc have less than perfect romantic direction throughout the series as well. But overall Stargate did a great job growing their characters while including romance without creating a space soap opera. ,Stargate,cothcii,14,t5_2qhar

3375643,0,t1_cpd1hak,They have established that there is a gate network and gates talk to each other. Thats why gates with a DHD are easier to go through than Earth when Earth uses the dialing computer and it doesnt automatically update for shift.So I realize that gates can tell each other if theyre occupied or something. But that doesnt mean the GDO uses subspace its just a radio transmitter. As seen in the Black Hole episode when they has to remodulate the radio frequency to get the code out.The handhelds on Destiny were Ancient design to begin with. So Im fine with them communicating with the gates. But the GDOs were made on Earth by the SGC.Even if the gates were talking to each other theres no reason why the receiving gate takes just as long to connect as the outgoing gate took to dial. You can pretty much tell when the incoming is from Earth or somewhere else bc the chevrons light up as slowly as it takes Earth to hand dial with the computer.

I liked it for what it was. I liked it more than SGA and SG in fact. Because hey I like character dramas.But no it didnt focus on technology so what?I kind of like it it took the best element of StarGate BSG DS and Voyager and threw them together into something cool. I was especially warm to the constant recurring theme that Young is basically running a somewhat benevolent military dictatorship and that the civilians arent happy. What always irked me about Voyager is that Janeway is running a military dictatorship she has no superiors any more. But no one raises it everyone is fine with it. If I were Janeway I would promptly transition the ship to a democracy. The idea of having a normal chain of command like that only works when the captain itself is answerable to her superiors who in turn are answerable to the commander in chief who in turn is answerable to the people and elected by the people.

Daniel definitely got around and almost always with chicks that burned him or would have burned him.I think Jack only slept with the girl from Argos in S after that whole experience he probably learned to keep is dick in his pants. Well with the implied exception of Carter at the end of Moebius which was  seasons coming....Tealc didnt screw around much except that when he did it was kind of infidelity. Hes married to Dreyauc but clearly has a real passion for Shanauc when she shows up Im pretty sure he sleeps with her in that episode too. And then he also has a thing for the chick from the Haktyl Resistance though thats after Dreyauc has died. Its interesting though from what weve seen through Tealc it seems Jaffa culture looks down on infidelity from the womans side but has nothing to say if the man goes outside the marriage or maybe it was just Tealc not really caring.Carter was the smartest of them sticking to partners from her birth planet but that didnt work out much better anyway.,Stargate,cr8z597,1,t5_2qhar

The Ancients probably planned to board it much earlier but probably didnt care after they figured out ascension. Its also possible that records of Destiny were lost to the sands of time but I digress.A lot of Destinys design is already superb. Its a long term recon ship and most of its systems are sustainable. It refills its power off of stars which are readily abundant. It has oxygen scrubbers and hydroponics facilities taking care of both air and food. Its water system is completely selfcontained its autopilot is flawless and in case something goes wrong theres a set of stasis pods for the crew to retreat to.The spare parts issue is crippling though. We know the seed ships had the ability to gather resources and manufacture incredibly complex technology i.e. Stargates. The seed ships were launched before Destiny too. Why not put a similar fabrication facility on Destiny itself or at least work out a way to get the seed ships to do a supply drop?The repair drones should also have been automated.

4392018,0,t1_csklzew,I agree with a lot of what you said but Im going to mostly discuss the last point.gt Atlantis even at the end was a relatively small mission  civilians and military topsI suspect on this point youre both underestimating the number of people that this hypothetical general would have under his command and overestimating the number required for a general.How many people were involved in the Stargate program at the beginning? During the first season of SG General Hammond couldnt have had much more than that under his command at the SGC. After reestablishing contact with Earth its always seemed to me that there would have been a significant increase in the number of people living in Atlantis. By season  Atlantis alone would almost have to be well over  people. Combine that with all the smaller offworld bases plus  battleships each with  crew according to the wiki attached to the Pegasus galaxy at a given time there had to have been a lot more than  people under this hypothetical generals command.But more important than the number of people involved is the scope of the mission and no matter the circumstance I cant imagine waging a multiplefront war across a galaxy as being the job assigned to anything less than a general.,Stargate,cskpsjd,2,t5_2qhar

Actually I guess it suffers from the same issue as the beta gate because if you look closely the Icarus base IS the SGC redressed so that is the original working gate prop with the Giza POO  except it was a written plot point that they needed to use the Earth Giza POO even though they werent on Earth... which was a mess in and of itself.,Stargate,csp8pmg,3,t5_2qhar

The basic plot was sound but some seriously lackluster acting even from a couple of the Trek alumni poor writing and the cut itself seeming like the editing team were following a very confused outline all amounted to a poor production as far as I was concerned.  Im not sure if this was Tim Russs first crack at directing but being a fanfilm aside I think he failed in that role though it was cool to see him reprise the Tuvok character.Side note Ive seen some people elsewhere complain about the VFX and set design.  As far as I was concerned I think they did pretty well for the most part given the tiny budget around k USD.

5421227,0,t1_cw4ht17,The episode wouldnt work with Daniel. Hed cross his arms and stand his ground. Hed dare Jack to blow him up. He has done it before. Its one of the reasons I like this season. The small break from Daniel allowed for an organic shift in how the team behaves. In diplomatic situations Jack can step back and let Sam take the lead we see this a bit in Shadow Play Cure and here in this episode.However Id go further than to say Sam was the replacement humanist for a few episodes. She has a subtle but noticeable arc of becoming more willing to allow her compassion and the human element to influence her while becoming more lax on the professional side. We really see this moving forward.In episodes like Revisions its Sam who makes the connection with Pallan. In Covenant she recommends a softer approach. Gemini is where she chooses to trust Replicarter. The final two seasons see her often offer emotional support to Mitchell.sgSam organically assumed a role that was largely reserved for Daniel in the earlier seasons. Im not entirely certain Daniel ever got back this role postascension. In fact most of his big prototypical Daniel moments occurred away from the team.Editgt making sense shed try and be nice to Fifth seeing him as remarkable from the scientific perspective rather than the human one.Actually I disagree with this. Sam seen Fifth from both a scientific AND human perspective. Its apparent as the Replicator story progresses and in how Sam spoke to Fifth during the episode and how she acted once they boarded the Prometheus at the end.,Stargate,cw4maii,6,t5_2qhar

With how slowly they where shown to develop technology with there being virtually no difference in technology from  years ago compared to  million years ago its pretty clear the million or so years at most between when they arrived here and launched Destiny had no significant change in technology.And honestly that story doesnt really change much.

Its static the Asuran humanform replicators in Pegasus. Its naive Fifth and the AI girl dumped into a virtual universe from Atlantis. It cant ascend Dr. Weir once she became a replicator.And in the case of the Asgard its degenerative. This is the fundamental flaw of Asgardian immortality. Every time their body is excessively damaged or worn out an Asgard just uploads into a computer then downloads back into a body. Like any replication process errors will eventually appear. In the case of the Asgard this is what I believe cost them their ability to think creatively. By the time they realized their mistake they couldnt reverse it. Their minds were already semidigital and theyd grown too big to get stuffed back into a regular brain. Maybe the Asgard actually could have survived but like their inability to think up projectile weapons they couldnt think up a way to survive. Instead they just looked down the road and saw a future maybe a few thousand years away where they were nothing more than a senile species Completely static endlessly copied never changing.,Stargate,cy5rrji,4,t5_2qhar

One of those shorter jumps was actually a fair bit longer as well being that they looped out and around to the next galaxy.  The shorter jumps took weeks at most not months.  As for why it had stasis pods extended jumps in general would have been why but not specifically for long jumps between galaxies.  A crew may want to simply sleep through a thousand years of the trip at a time leapfrogging through time as the ship progressed.

I mean even though they had their asses handed to them in Camelot Part  there was still a coalition of the most advanced entities in the Milky Way that banded together to end the threat Tauri Asgard Jaffa and Lucian Alliance.Pegasus has the Wraith maybe the travelers and then the Atlantis expedition. Maybe the Vanir if they were backed into a corner. But even still the Ori ships are built with ascended knowledge so theyre likely going to topple just about anything thrown their way. Atlantis and a few Lantean battleships would put up the best fight but the Ori may eventually outnumber them and our s could give them a pounding but if they just kept sending more ships through a supergate the tide might turn in their favor.As for everyone else they havent really dealt with the false god spiel before so if the priors show up to any of those more primitive planets they might be able to convince them rather easily.

6915069,0,t1_d103i8c,I agree with the idea that some of the canon originally laid out in the film should have precedence over the show since it came first but I cant overlook the things that dont make sense.Ra as a parasite being the alien resembling an Asgard doesnt work for me because an Asgard or typical scifi greys are about half the size of adult humans so how could a being that large realistically fit inside of a human body as a parasite? In this case it makes more sense that Ra was some other form of entity perhaps and energy being as your link explains. In contrast with the show the Goauld are much more believable as parasitical beings thanks to their tiny size and appearance as eellike creatures.Another commonly believed piece of canon about the movie which I refuse to accept is that Ras guards were normal humans and not Jaffa. I talked about this recently in another thread but essentially the scene in which the Anubis Guard breaks the staff weapon in two with his bare hand during his fight with Jack is meant to show that he and his comrades are overly strong likely even of superhuman strength. That sounds more like a Jaffa or maybe even other Goaulds with human hosts.But of course to each their own in terms of what you want to consider canon or not.,Stargate,d10598p,1,t5_2qhar

After Ra was defeated if Earth hadnt gone on to deal with the rest of the System Lords within a few hundred years thered have been another Goauld taking the name Ra.It sort of works with the way mythology works with different gods waxing and waning in power and importance over time. Some of it can be explained by Goauld defeating each other and so on but some probably comes down to one Goauld being killed and thus becoming less important in the mythology as perceived by humans and then becoming more important a few hundred years later when a new Goauld takes the name and rises.,Stargate,d11ycmx,2,t5_2qhar

If youre not going to listen to anyone else theres no reason to waste any more time trying to explain things to you.  A rape survivor is alive. They feel things. They react to things. They are relevant to a continuing storyline.      A dead person is dead. They feel nothing. They react to nothing. Their only relevance to a continuing storyline is conveyed through other people.  One person is dead and does not continue to act. The other person is not dead and does continue to act. Have I spelled it out enough for you? It doesnt matter if death is worse than rape. Thats not the point. Refusing to deal with rape in fiction is lazy and frankly a waste of a perfectly good story hook.

7613658,0,t3_4jkr2p,I just completed my first watch of it. I stopped watching during its initial airing at the season one mid season break and never bothered watching it again until now.My initial impression is that Season one is just bad. I dont care about any of the characters outside of Eli and Tamara as well as the minor characters like James Barnes Volker etc.Scott just wants to bang someone while brown nosing Young. Rush just wants to mislead everyone. Young is too indecisive. Wray just wants to be in charge. Greer is just a loose cannon. Chloe is apparently there for love interest purposes and not much else.Season two improved. All the characters I disliked in season one got better by the middle of season two except Chloe. Her Im changing and useless arc was worse than Teylas pregnancy arc.I think the series really picked up after the Stargate took a back seat for the most part. Season one it felt shoehorned in. Season two it just seemed like it wasnt the focus of the show. The actual crew was the focus. I do hate the stones though. If there are stones there should be clear rules to their usage. No intimacy for example because that just seems completely wrong to take over someones body then have sex etc in it.To be honest I think Universe would have been better as another franchise altogether.

Ive dated people who are way older than I am and I could see their notsoslick moves coming from a mile away. So I can see how even though we might assume that an oldass Goauld might be extremely practiced at seduction it could be quite the opposite. Plus that whole Im a god Ill not be denied thing could have something to do with her lack of sublety. Ill admit Im generally less than enthusiastic about clip episodes. I feel a bit validated to hear your point of view on them so thanks for sharing. But I like to see what new scenarios the writers find to make it work so theyre still worth watching. Anything to do with Kinsey gives me a headache though. I understand his role in the story but it doesnt keep me from wishing hed been killed off after his first appearance.

But if this could be set up without their knowledgeand without using any planetary gatesit might work out OK. While theyre at it...

Game of Thrones has indeed shown a way of dealing with other languages. Quick interstellar travel by ship kind of negates the point of having stargates in the first place. And the Ancients were much more intriguing as a mythical species. To me ONeill with the Ancient repository of knowledge downloaded into his brain surpassed all other Ancients depicted.

Also it takes many hours SG x for the Asgards to carry Prometheus all the way to Ida but a week for them to give a lift to ONeill back from Atlantis to Earth SGA x which suggests Ida is much closer from the Milky Way than Pegasus is.The Alteran home galaxy is way further than the aforementioned galaxies which is why the Ori used the supergate to reach the Milky Way rather than conventional hyperspace.

They could have a Stargate on board the ship for easy travel to earth and other planets but the show would largely focus on missions where gate travel wouldnt be viable. For example if they are still fighting the Lucian alliance like they were during SGU gates on occupied planets would most likely be shieldedguarded. Maybe investigating the numerous planets without Stargates and putting Stargates on some of them. Mainly I just want to find out more about what happened after SGSGA in the Milky Way.

They would send   troops armed to the teeth and most of all...... every single unit would wear fucking helmets. The most realistic version of this Ive seen in the Stargate universe is when the military sends REAL aid to help defend Atlantis in Stargate  Atlantis. Also the military would never have the type of morale they show throughout the show. Humanity would be ruthless in aquiring whatever they needed to defend earth.

Since SG teams are outnumbered in every skirmish they need the additional stopping power more than the weapons longevity.  If you need a sidearm with infinite ammo a zat seems better in that its small and about as accurate at close range plus it has a nonlethal function unmatched by any TauRe weapon.  What I never understood was why they didnt try to reverse engineer those little power crystals in the staffs.  Theyre clearly better than batteries or bullets in terms of energy density I feel like they could easily have greatly improved upon the staff weapons to make automatic energy weapons that could be like the ones the Kull warriors use.  ,Stargate,ddriw39,4,t5_2qhar

Ive never once seen the wraith as a culture that enjoys sitting on ass on some planet. Hell even most of the workstations and consoles on their ships  are designed for standing.
