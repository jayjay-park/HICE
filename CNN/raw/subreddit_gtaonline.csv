If you do this race with a Paradise van I have this set to the default vehicle it takes almost a little over  min.Create a  race playlist and tape down R. Start the race and browse reddit. The race will run itself. Every four minutes restart the race no need to release R.Completing this playlist will net you  RP in  min.

We have received a large number of complaints over the past few weeks about cheaters gifting large amounts of GTA to others setting bounty rewards outside game limits or otherwise attempting to tamper with the GTA Online economy.gt gt We have deployed several hotfixes to prevent this type of activity and will be adding further cheat protection in future Title Updates as well. Players who willingly cheated to create this illegitimate influx of ingame currency have been separated out from the rest of the population and we are continuing to monitor for suspicious activity. If you were the unwilling recipient of an impossibly large amount of GTA you do not need to worry about us taking action against your account. However please be aware that we will be making communitywide automatic adjustments to players account balances to remove the modded money.gt gt At this time you do not need to do anything further and this ticket will resolve on its own. Thank you for contacting us to report this activity. We look forward to seeing you Online!gt gt If you believe you are receiving this message in error or your ticket is not about GTA Online cheaters please feel free to respond to this message and we will address your issue individually. Please note that we are not currently accepting appeals for players banned or in the Cheater Pool for transferring modded cash to others and we are not able to remove these cash gifts on a casebycase basis. Account balance adjustments will occur systemwide to undo these gifts.gt gt Rockstar Games,gtaonline,ceq16r8,1,t5_2xrd1

A lot of them already keep no money in their account so they cant pay for insurance.Im an advocate of increasing the cooldown on calling a tank. Once per ingame day  minutes real time sounds perfectly appropriate.Another thing I advocate is that you cant operate the gun without a second player. One player drives the other player operates the gun. It is GTA Online after all.Personally I dont believe in bad sport or anybody paying insurance. I think you should pay to insure your car the first time and then it is free to pick it back up at any time. So then its not a big deal if someone else blows up your car and cant afford to pay the insurance.

Does it matter what youre looking at? Do you get a fuckin boner from running around staring at your female characters ass? Do you not play games like gears of war because you dont like man ass? Thats almost as weird as dudes playing female characters because they want to pretend to be a chick.In gta there doesnt seem to be much of a point but Ive played WoW and have come across guys pretending to be girls to get special treatment and thats just weird.I dont think girls online should really have to worry about the trolls... but unfortunately they do.  Its not like girls are incapable of gaming at the same level. Its just that most girls dont grow up playing video games because most games are marketed towards teenage boys and males are more competitive by nature so online competitive gaming is mostly guys.  And when a female does show up the trolls and neckbeard virgins come out of the woodwork.

518561,0,t3_201uji,Played last night with a buddy had a random join for a mission.  As soon as the mission ended and we were all standing around random turned and machine gunned me down.  Soon as I respawned he did it again.  I respawned again took him out and then accidentally killed another random player who showed up.  He came back and I just stood there with  no weapon out in the middle of a gang attack.  He and I then finished off the gang attack then rode around together for a bit and as soon as I could I shared some cash with him and sent him a note saying sorry for the accidental kill.  Then I commended him online.  Id say at this point its about  you find someone willing to jump in your vehicle and ride around with you.  Although there are some dickheads driving around doing the two honks and then killing you when you come over to them.

You can have slow reaction times poor aim bad map awareness and you can still win with direct splash damage while being protected from everythingThe tanks in this game are stupid. Infinite ammo in a tank is one of the many design flaws in this game. I know I couldnt singlehandedly design a game as well done as GTA but its not a good sign if as a player I can recognize major flaws and can think of possible fixes. For example the fact that there is no option to change what your assisted aim will lock on to is bewildering. Its asinine. The tank is also asinine.

778075,0,t3_231fbq,I killed two fugitives each with a bounty of k fleeing in the same car. I was following them with a Buzzard in the road on the edge of Alamo Sea.When I got there I had to take down a Frogger from another player who was already behind them. That was the easy part. The vision I had at the time. The square at the top indicates the position of Frogger. The square to the left indicates the position of the fugitives.Im too bad to hit someone on the ground with missiles they were managing to escape easily just following the road quickly. The path they were following. Arrows indicate bridges.But with so many missiles fired I got a wanted level. It was my salvation. I noticed a police car stopped in front of the last bridge and calculated that a missile would take roughly the same time that the fugitives to reach there. I aimed at the police car and fired a missile. It took about  long seconds for the missile to get there but it worked. The police car exploded shortly before the fugitives dive in the explosion. The square indicates where the fugitives were when I shot. The explosion indicates the police car.I got the k Bounty and I had to pay  dollars for car insurance.After that day I always try to use this technique when hunting with Buzzard.Excuse me for my english Im using an online translator.,gtaonline,cgspz9a,8,t5_2xrd1

847557,0,t3_23t410,Ive beaten pretty much all the missions solo several times over on Hard difficulty except for the ones that require two or more players. Yes even Satellite Communications and Out of Harmony. On that particular mission I dont try and climb onto the pier from the water. I pull the boat really really close to the platform and then jump directly from the boat to the platform without getting my feet wet at all. Theres some cover on the pier that helps when youre taking care of the stragglers too.Some basic combat tipsUse an assault rifle for generalpurpose mayhem. Any assault rifle will work except the AK which is substantially weaker than the others. Try to stay in cover and only advance when its clear. If enemies are clustered switch to the autoshotty and sweep them with manual aim. If theyre in vehicles use the RPG Grenade Launcher or Minigun. If theyve got a helicopter the Minigun or Heavy Sniper work wonders. The sniper rifles are basically hitscan and have insanely long range at least a kilometer and no ballistic drop I once shot a player off their motorcycle from the top of the Maze Bank tower all the way to the driveway of Los Santos Customs in East Lost Santos. In all the missions where Im on foot and attacked by an NPCcontrolled helicopter my first line of defense is my Heavy Sniper. Like A Boat in the Bay or Dry Docking for example. As soon as the chopper is within lineofsight its vulnerable to the Heavy Sniper. One or two hits to the pilot is a guaranteed takedown but a dozen anywhere on the fuselage are also a kill.Remember that you can rolldodge by hitting X  or Square PS while aiming down the sights and moving in a direction. Its not as effective against NPCs but it might lower your profile and prevent you from taking the brunt of an attack. Wait until the enemy exposes themselves and then pop out of cover while locking onto their head momentarily fire a short burst and then release the Ltrigger to go back into cover. If things get really hairy open your inventory and chow on some Ego Chasers but try and do it while in cover so you avoid the timeconsuming eating animation.Always remember that you can shoot enemies at longer range with manual aim than you can with lockon aim. The lockon distance is limited to fairly short range while the projectiles travel much further. If your reticule turns red you can hit whatever it is.,gtaonline,ch0mdrn,5,t5_2xrd1

940000,0,t3_24vaia,Poor review.  months to say that you like the sound and environment design but dont like the community?  I understand there are legitimate issues brought up with this review mainly the connectionfreezing problems but I really feel this reviewer forgot the point they made in the beginning To enjoy this game you have to let go of any semblance of control.  Its a fucking sandbox game. There really is no point except to have fun doing damn near anything you want. To bitch about getting killed over and over in free mode is pathetic. What the hell did you expect from open lobbies on a console? And to that point those deaths they kept showing were absurd and either planned or the reviewer really doesnt play this game often at all. Find a crew go on forums or reddit and find other likeminded players to play with or stop complaining about getting bullied in free mode. There are plenty of crews out there who play in private lobbies that do some really fun events.  I know R could have done much better in terms of ease of access to crews and other friendly players but those on here calling for friendly lobbies how do you expect R to police these lobbies?  Im not saying GTA Online is perfect far from it but it definitely is better than how this crap review that took  fucking months to put together portrays it.,gtaonline,chb4tox,6,t5_2xrd1

Unlocks that makes the good even better while the bad has no way to improve is not great game design. I dont mind to unlock things if it was only cosmetic like the paint jobs and the weapons colors.

1750780,0,t1_cjzu5n2,You raise a very good point that highlights so many failings in the code of GTA. The glitches are rampant because theres little sanity checking in much of the code which they are constantly chasing their tail to patch.The issue with the glitches is that they operate to circumvent ordinary operation. Since theres no servers the console is both client and server its a mesh then theres no specific oversight to the game aside from what Rockstar add in.Now you would find this amazing but it was not until now in patch . that Rockstar introduced hash checking of game files which was eerie considering my post after Chrome got legally nailed which has pretty much nailed ISO modders the only thing left is memory mods which are harder than your average tard with a modded console he bought of Ebay can handle.Now as for your comment about a simple check ...They do this already the problem is the glitch breaks the check.Take this for example a fake god mode scenario involving an animationSo lets say for instance the act of leaving your garage which renders you invulnerable for a short time has a potential glitch whereby during the animation you go to the PSNXBL store then quit. The act of going into or out of the store breaks the function which renders you permanently invulnerable.So the code and I use the term very loosely would look something like this ....    function vulnerable       .... code            function invulnerable      .... code            function exit.garage         invulnerable        play.animation        vulnerable    During the exit.garage function where the engine calls the various vulnerableinvulnerable functions if you glitch the engine right in between the play.animation and the vulnerable it plays the animation and returns control but never loops out back to the vulnerable stage. How do they fix it without adding a timed job of some description sapping console resources affecting gameplay to eliminate the glitch?Its a very tight rope to walk. One thing I have suggested to Rockstar previously is that when a function is called that results in a state vulnerableinvulnerable change then all input should be ceased until completed. Yeah it might upset people if theyre doing some animation and a job comes up ... but seriously deal with it. In the art of combating some of these glitches some functionality eggs need to be broken. GTA Online is in need of some serious sanity checking that dont require additional background code to operate in some cases simply ignoring input until the function completes     function exit.garage         halt.input        invulnerable        play.animation        vulnerable        start.input    This would serve two purposes one the player might still glitch it but they would be in god mode with an effectively useless console. No amount of connectingdisconnecting the controller would or at least shouldnt return input forcing the glitcher to quit the game in order to return control of their character and they would get very bored of that very quickly.So there are things Rockstar could be doing to combat glitchers their biggest problem is deciding which is the best way without impacting on overall console performance and experience and this is where the balancing act occurs.,gtaonline,cjzuedz,11,t5_2xrd1

The most common guess I have heard is they will change a pointer in you Rockstar Social Club account.gt Is it possible to sell cars or just erase them from your garage without being asked to restore them? Doubt it. But it is easy enough to sell the cars at LSC.gt  What is the best guns now best car best apartment? The answer to that is a matter of personal taste.  As a general rule each update introduces cars and weapons near the top of their respective category.  Look for things tagged with part of the XXXX updategt Will PS players who transfer their character still get the K online bonus?The bonus is for preordering the new versions so yes you will get the bonus if you preorder.gt Also what keeps you all playing?I play because i find it relaxing after work.

2177728,0,t3_2k034x,I think thats the idea. Ive always thought that the clue is in the title its called GTA Online not GTAV Online. I believe the idea is that any future online games will take place in the same online universe and they say that they want people to be anle to travel between cities. However it doesnt seem right that characters cars garages etc wouldshould persist across games partly because a lot of people have gained moneyitems illegitimately but mainly because if you go to a new game with millions already in the bank theres no early game challenge. I dont think Rockstar would be willing to lose that its part of GTA to be restricted in what you can buy youre supposed to steal stuff from other people. Personally I dont think that their first attempt at an MMO style online game should be the one that persists. I love this game but there are so many creases that need ironing out economy game balancing character individuality etc that I think a hit of the big old reset button would be a better idea. I would redo the mechanics of the game keep the Los Santos map add another map and release it as a new game. ,gtaonline,clgn4u9,12,t5_2xrd1

2793816,0,t1_cnlmri7,Ive never gotten less than  for robbing a store and pulled as much as k. You only get  stars if you kill the clerk. And honestly if you cant slip a  star wanted level thats on you. Even if you have to wait  minutes thats still k assuming you know which cars to sell for practically no effort.Steal one of the cars he texts to you not the high priority vehicle no one has any clue youre doing it.Theres gang attacks all over the map get a helicopter and go do them away from everyone else. Otherwise hold your ground and kill them this is GTA after all.Get bullet proof tires? I dont see how people shooting will stop you from finishing a race if anything now theyre distracted trying to shoot you and should make winning easier.Ill give you this a v does pay shit. Im not saying waste your time sitting outside a bountys apartment thats stupid. There are plenty of times to kill a bounty in free mode you just have to pursue as soon as you see them.

3033008,0,t3_2uv3iu,i love this idea and would love to see similarly styled missions in free roam.  i think the trick would be to not advertise the mission objectives to the whole map a la the simeon green car.  people rarely go for the simeon green car because everyone sees it and you just know someone is going to fuck with you if you grab it.  raising the payout would only make people fight for it more which would end up in its destruction which would make us ignore it again.  but if maybe you had to call simeon to get the green icon and if it disappeared when someone grabbed the car it could be much more interesting.  or maybe it just appears to players in the vicinity.  you could show changes to the mission status in the text log i.e. someone killed someone.  simeon wants a rare car delivered.  so and so picked up the rare car etc. people would have to guess as to who had the car which would raise the chances of success and create more of an interesting manhunt especially if there was more than one drop point or more routes to the drop point.  if this was applied to other mission styles it could be a lot of fun. tldr id like to see more ways to make money in free roam with reasonable interference from other players.,gtaonline,cocdbaq,1,t5_2xrd1

3045420,0,t1_codnngq,ampampamp The Fox and the Grapes sfw gtThe Fox and the Grapes is one of the traditional Aesops fables and can be held to illustrate the concept of cognitive dissonance In this view the premise of the fox that covets inaccessible grapes is taken to stand for a person who attempts to hold incompatible ideas simultaneously. In that case the disdain the fox expresses for the grapes at the conclusion to the fable serves at least to diminish the dissonance even if the behaviour in fact remains irrational.  The moral to the story is It is easy to despise what you cannot get. gtgtImage i  The illustration of the fable by Franois Chauveau in the first volume of La Fontaines fables Interesting Color Rhapsodies | List of Kanon episodes | Cognitive dissonance Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcodnnuy oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecodnnuy.

But nothing about the difficult stuff like ELASTIC load balancing which is what absolutely matters for high profile systems like GTAO. Nothing about data streaming technologies.

With diminishing returns as far as RPhr and GTAhr after the  minute mark.See the charts here for how it looks for the GTA.The time based payout is complicated by the fact that there is a time between missions or loading time.

3366060,0,t1_cp8vkbe,I could understand that ideology. But I think Rockstar just thought more about everyones time constraints in general. Its better to allow the players to do jobs when they want and are able to do so rather than set weekly rollouts on specific dates where some people will not be able to do them and miss out on the content. Which in turn would produce an unbalanced Online economy based on ROCKSTARS actions and not the the players own judgement and allocations.,gtaonline,cpbyff4,1,t5_2xrd1

If they tell you not to jump out of the helicopter until it reaches the right altitude then dont jump out until it reaches the right altitude.

In that mission though that garage only has  parking spaces in it far less than .Im sure theyll make some mansions available eventually since the Independence Day addon put a few standalone houses up for sale.

4247116,0,t3_39kmbl,I did it a few weeks ago and the first thing I realized while doing it is that it wasnt even remotely as hard as I expected. The challenge came from schedules and the occasional random thing that happens.Heavy utility vest  multiple sets of armor  snacks  Kuruma  failing C.M. is going to come down to a fluke thingOn the other hand you should make sure that your crew is decent. I attempted a run after I already completed the challenge  purely for fun with some people I found on reddit. Absolute fucking disaster. On Fleeca I talked to the host about how if we all close the application if somebody dies it wont reset our progress.Then we get to Prison Break  Plane. We are all in the same Kuruma. For some ungodly fucking reason they do not want to trip skip jesus fucking christ you guys its  just pay the goddamn fee. I am not bitter.But the one positive of this long unnecessary drive is that we had time to discuss the mission. But its fuckin plane theres not a whole lot to discuss. Everyone who has done this before  what is the ONE thing you have to worry about if you do this mission in a Kuruma?I was in the party. I was not on mute. I am not bitter. I said So yeah pretty much the only thing we have to worry about is the fuel tanks exploding near us. We should try to shoot them when were a decent distance away so we dont have to worry about them exploding or us bumping into themGuess what happens literally  seconds later.He.Drives.INTO THE CLIFFORD THE BIG RED DOGSIZED FUEL TANK KILLING US ALL  SECONDS AFTER I SAID THATS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD POSSIBLY FUCK USIm not bitter.Then I close the application and say uhh...what happened? did you guys quit the game in time?The host in a confused tone says wait whyd you leave? now we have to start from the beginning....tldr rheistteams is not  reliable although when I did c.m. for real I met two very competent people who got us through it!I did not plan on telling this whole story.

4318695,0,t3_3af630,Some tips if anyone is planning on trying out this challenge Take the time to get a good team together.  Save an outfit with the utility vest and bulletproof helmet and actually use it. You can survive one of your gernades while wearing these during heiststhey dont do anything in freemode lobbies besides slowing you down Buy snacks and armor. Use them.  Know who is doing what when and how before each setup or heist. If you dont feel confident playing a certain role ask someone else that is competent to do it. Many setups dont need to be done in a certain way. There are often much safereffective ways to do things.  Kuruma. Need I say more?  Trip skip when you can. Everyone needs to be in the same vehicle to do so. Saves alot of time.  Before starting the fleeca job do one setup together. This is just a precaution used to prevent a glitch where all your progress is lost later on.  Get everyone into the same invite only session. Load times are MUCH faster this way.  Things dont always go as planned dont get too worked up if you fail. Make sure to figure out how to keep it from happening again.  Although I wouldnt reccomend it.. If someone dies you can all attempt to close application to prevent the game from saving. Must be done within  seconds of the death.  Ive heard that its more effective if the host pulls the power cord from the outlet and having everyone else close application. However doing so runs a chance of losing or corrupting files permanently.  Mics. Use them. Take a  minute break in between heists. Im not saying screw around in free mode and pimp out your rides at LSC. I mean actually leave your screen. Doing so tends to keep you sharp and sane. Ill add more if I think of something else. ,gtaonline,cscg1gj,11,t5_2xrd1

I ran through ALL of the setup missions only got three platinums   with the same group of randoms the host had specifically messaged the lobby asking for help to do it because he had never been able to. So on the finale a guy goes in to get his Kuruma from the apt. next door to the Lectros comes out...I was providing cover fire for the other two guys while they hopped in.  The guy just leaves and Im stuck all by myself with cops on all sides urging them to come back so I can hop in with them.  Nope.  Keeps on going.  I got out of the pickle I was in but ran out of time before I could get to the boat.  They all started cussing at me for dicking around and Im thinking Are you fuckin kidding me?!  They probably cussed a lot more once I left them so that they had to restart the whole thing.  Dicks. ,gtaonline,csu0m8p,2,t5_2xrd1

4482976,0,t3_3cghzp,PC is in a big mess at the moment from what I have experienced. Most sessions will have at least one player modding and while some will be passive others will abuse their power. Modders have the ability to crash your game remove reports and ruin your fun at any point so its best to stay clear of pubic lobbies unless you intend on trying to get free money which is also another popular thing modders do the economy for now on PC is fucked.As long as you play in invite only sessions your safe as they cant join you so I would recommend this. Outside public free roam sessions there arent too many modders though you may encounter some in modes like Death matches where they turn on god mode but this has only happened once or twice.Everyone has a different experience like back on PS I hardly came across any modders while others found loads.

4567098,0,t1_ct5kgkg,Characters having long hair like Angelina Jolie or bountiful Kate Upton locks will not work well with our GTAO characters because the moment they turn their head to the left or right the rigid hair would pass through their bodies making our characters look like ghosts and only drawing more attention to the hair further making it look like stiff cardboard. In fact some of the hairstyles that already exist for girls in GTAO do pass through the character models a little bit the tips of the hair but a little bit is okay. But when long  large handfuls of hair pass through the collarbone chest and trapezius region it looks wrong especially up close in cutscenes like Lester and Agent s briefing scenes.Heres a thread showing many NPC females its NSFW because some ppl included topless pics of NPCs. There are many examples of girls with longer hair but you know the moment they turn their heads that long stiff hair would pass through their shoulders like a ghost through a wall. We dont mind it so much for NPCs since they are seen from a distance mostly but for our GTAO characters it wont look good when they have to do far more actions like getting inout of a car jumping out of plane hiding in cover etcI would love ladies with longer hair too but I believe R when they say the technological and logistical hindrances just wont allow it now.

Whether it be how op said about the military hovercraft or putting in vehicles that came out of something like death race that are mounted with machine guns and rockets. ,gtaonline,ctoynh4,5,t5_2xrd1

4730156,0,t3_3fpiuh,WARNING I wrote this myself. Text wall incoming. Vans Try to use a mic at all times. It is so much easier to verbally say the directions instead of using the damn DPad. Also dont shoot the cops. Three stars are annoying as hell. That mission with that weirdo on the island Its best for as many players as possible to have a custom outfit that is heavy combat suit with a bulletproof helmet. If this is the case make the heist clothing Player Saved Outfits or tell the host to make that change. Stick together stay in cover and dont fight towards the end. I have failed that mission so many times because one person will get Avi in the cutscene whom Avi will follow around at all times and that player and Avi get in the boat first. Other players then throw said player out of the boat and in turn Avi jumps out and everyone dies. Play it safe keep armorsnacks handy dont fight. Hack This one isnt incredibly difficult IMO. Like the previous setup just stay in cover and stick to your role. The guys towards the end of your shootout are really the only challenges for me because they have decent cover and have good distance between you and them. When taking the black van to wherever the waypoint is try having the highest level in the back of the van or in the passenger seat. A combat MG always helps in either killing the occupants of the enemy cars or blow the cars up altogether. If these are not available to you play it safe duck and gun it. Convoy A kuruma is helpful but not really needed. The Kuruma helps when barricading the road to block the trucks and its security and the bulletproof car helps while using it for cover. What is very helpful and almost completely necessary is a heavy sniperhoming or rocket launcher for the first Savage in the mission. That thing has explosive EVERYTHING so you need to take it out quickly because the armed Insurgent hasnt appeared yet most likely. IMPORTANT DO NOT USE EXPLOSIVES AT ALL. THE TRUCK CAN AND WILL EXPLODE. Just keep the truck covered and take out Merryweather before they make too much contact. Bikes This doesnt even require a strategy. If possible grab a bunch of body armor and an Armored Kuruma drive inyou know the drill from there. If nobody has a kuruma take cover outside the lot and hope to live. Use the bikes KERS when you near the roadblocks and speed past them just dont crash. ,gtaonline,ctqs0ck,5,t5_2xrd1

It just spammed the screen so immediately I appeared to have caused it.You see its not because you caused damage There is an actual player list that you can use to pick who you wants to be Framed.That is the most obvious way of hacking and usually people dont fall for it after you explain it Its just too stupid a modder would never have his name displayed on your screen unless he wants it to hence so many options I remember counting  ways  but most are replicas on how to kill one or every player with the choice of having your own name any players name or anonymously shows up as suicide. Adding onetwofivetenone hundredinfinite explosions to a player with your namewith anyone in the servers nameanonymously shows up as suicide. VERY COMMONQuick clarification Your name means the modders name. Shooting a player with any weapon from any distance with normal damage using your own nameanyone in the servers name. UNCOMMON Sending a Jihad to the player spawns a flailing priest attached to the front of the player exploding and killing the player. Priest wont despawn until you change session and die. VERY UNCOMMON Sending invincible NPC attackers using the base MP MaleMP Female skin to attack a player in a insurgent or a rhino. They stop attacking after you die resume attacking if you provoke them. VERY RARE Sending a piggybackriding nude hooker to the player theyre invincible and kill you until you change sessions and die. RARE Spawning several merrywheather cargo planes on top of the player. Usually crashes your game if your PC isnt that good but mostly lags everyone nearby and drops FPS like a brick. VERY UNCOMMON Setting the player on fire persists for as long as its turned on. UNCOMMON Electrifying the player doesnt kill you just basically stunlocks you. UNCOMMON Attatching a tear gas grenade to the player kills you and anyone around you if they are dumb enough.

5918033,0,t3_3w99jd,A lot of accurate info especially on how to not waste money but some of it is unnecessary. Its good to know all of this but when it actually comes to making money a lot of this is just in the way. Wait out a bounty? Its possible but in that time you could do so many missions its totally not worth it. The sort of stuff you want to know when looking at money making guide is how to make a lot of it fast or at least how to be efficient about it.To me most free roam events races deathmaches work only if you are lucky enough to win and bet on yourself. Thats too unpredictable dont bother if your aim is money generation. Do them if you want to have fun. Unfortunately making money and fun doesnt go hand in hand.Plus you need to wait for people to sing up for those. That can often last as long as doing a mission itself. I used to sell rare gang cars on xbox  when they were worth k even bought a garage next to their spawn place to be quick about it and had a timer on to know when can I sell the next one. Now on ps its k not worth the effort. Personally I would do the following Hop in to the game. Drive down to nearest modshop and steal and sell the best car you can find on the way. Dont bother waiting out for the rare ones it takes too much time. You could have done a mission or two in the meantime while you hunt for it go to the right spot at the right time with the right vehicle. If youre lucky you should find a car worth k easy money while it takes  sec to a minute to get to the nearest mod shot from your spawn. From there do contact missions. Most of the time in GTA is wasted in the menus changing lobbies etc. so crew that and do a playlist instead with missions which allow you to blow shit up with pegasus vehicles. Waiting too long for people to join? Screw that and go solo its less money but at the end of the day its about being quick about it. Theres also a chance that the person that joined is a troll or inexperienced so youll be wasting time.About heists dont bother doing it with randoms and dont bother setting them up yourself. People troll or suck you might get a negative balance at the end of the day. I have once wasted  evenings attempting to do pacific standard with someone inexperienced and never finished it. The other day Ive successfully finished two of those in one evening without much trouble on hard. So Ill leave it up to you although personally I think its more practical and efficient doing missions even solo.,gtaonline,cxvdvto,2,t5_2xrd1

5974830,0,t3_3x9d80,Alright so Ill try to keep this short.Honestly You probably cant go wrong with heists the problem here is you have to find  other nonmorons which can be difficult. Bust out is the mission you want to go really get a kuruma or any  seater go pick up the guy and deliver him back to the  warehouse it is very simple. Once you finish the mission go back to free roam and start it again from where you spawned dont move too much or it will mess up the spawn location on the actual mission.Once you get the normal spawnyoull know  for this mission get in your car and head to the highway and start heading towards the bus once you are at the bus kill the driver and wait for Gus to get in your car. Start heading back towards the warehouse.Heres where this becomes my favorite mission as you head back down the highway toward the warehuse get over into the left lane oncoming traffic and from there jump on the railroad and stay on the railroad and head back to the warehouse using the railroad instead of the actual road where there will be cops trying to attack you. Using the railroad is much better than the actual road as there will be no cops to attack you and you will eventually lose your wanted level before you get to the warehouse. After getting close to the warehpuse you will need to ride atop some cliffs and down a mountain to get to the street below should not be too hard once you get the hang of it. From there complete the mission and get ready to start it over. Once you get the hang of it you should be able to finish this mission in about  which will net you  and  RP so if done quickly you can finish the mission and start it again in  minutes.  x  roughly K which I know isnt as good as RR or LSC but in terms of actual difficulty this quest cant be beat. So its extremely easy to do pays really well and doesnt require much thought on your end. So my suggestion is to get a few audio books or some podcasts and go into autopilot mode and do this mission over and over its what Ive done for about  hours now and its been pretty great money although now Im broke from the yacht lol.Ive aquired a TON of money from doing this  Ts Osiris Hydra Aquarius m Low rider so trust me it defiantly works I suggest thsis mission since its very easy to get into an autopilot mode since like I said it doesnt require much from you to complete its basically just driving. While playing I listen to a podcast Painkiller already or listen to the game of thrones audio books. So its very easy to do while paying little attention at all. Good luck have fun. ,gtaonline,cy2ty43,13,t5_2xrd1

6006196,0,t1_cy6q1zv,The Dubsta  only spawns between am and pm.  If you do the mission from Lester called Denial of Service it locks the time at noon.  After you kill the st set of trucks the timer in the bottom right goes away.  As long as you dont complete the mission you can stay there as long as you need to spawn it.  Ive found the most luck at the LS Customs by the airport.  Once you get one to spawn have the person drive it into their garage then you can finish the mission.  LS Customs is disabled in the mission so you cant put the insurance on it until youre back in freemode.  Using this method Ive not had to wait more than  minutes usually to get one to spawn.  Also players in other vehicles can mess up the spawning.  So if youre trying to spawn it for someone else have them go and kill the trucks while youre trying to get it to spawn.  Once you get it to spawn just drive it to them.  Hope this helps. ,gtaonline,cy6xyl4,2,t5_2xrd1

6165476,0,t3_3ztqb8,The Savage is devastating if you can get the cannon into range. It will destroy anything. However  it handles like a flying pile of bricks and even worse unlike the real life Hind it is based on it is a cream puff. Never mind a homing launcher  you can shoot it down with a pistol. Yes literally a pistol. During the Convoy mission in the Pacific Standard heist chain people generally amuse themselves by shooting the first savage with a sniper at long range. The Buzzard is a far better general use helicopter. Its faster it maneuvers excellently and while the machine gun on that is useless the missiles still do a lot of damage and you can dodgeturnbe a leaf on the wind. So if you have the  million and never need to carry passengers the Hydra is by far the more effective fighting aircraft.Of course if you often play with friends the Valkyrie deserves a mention. You can really fuck things up with that three gunners on board and a competent pilot and very little will survive near it. For ground attack it is a scary beast. ,gtaonline,cyqg90x,1,t5_2xrd1

You can get a modded Sandking to spawn nearly  guaranteed and they sell for an average of k vs the K of a dubsta then the next time you can sell one is  minutes later.  If you sell  cars over the course of a  hour gaming session this would come down to  K for Sandkings sold   for Dubsta soldk difference in  hours in other words about  minutes worth of VIP sightseer work is hardly going to have people running to the shops for shark cards i think......,gtaonline,cz6b277,2,t5_2xrd1

Once you are there there are two lines of code where you replace your current crew color hex code with the new one followed by an AA or a few other letters AA has worked on all of them i did but some require a different set its all listed in the forum post if I can find it.  What it does is allow you to enter ANY hex code instead of just the ones the Social Club thinks you should be allowed to use.

Im arguing against all the cars listed in the first paragraph which takes me to your first point why did they bring out the Schafter V when its the same car as the regular Schafter just with a different bumper and new engine? The designers didnt have to do much to create a whole new car. They didnt challenge themselves to be creative. And from what Ive read the upgraded Banshee is slow on straightaways so now its even less competitive with super cars.Its all subjective and clearly the two new cars were received well by the community. That is good and Im happy about that. Im commenting on the prices and the reuse of designs from several years ago.

6707541,0,t3_47i9vt,I think the Savage should have had a rapidfire payload that shot  rockets at a target in rapid succession see CoD Black Ops campaign where you pilot the Hind. Speaking of the Savage which is based off of the AHA and the Hind D should take more than one rocket. In the Soviet occupation of Afghan the Mujahideen were given FIMA Stingers which the Homing Launcher is based off of to combat Hinds. And even then it took   even  rockets to down one. Theyre heavily armored helos which is why it makes no sense that a mm SMG can make the engine smoke in less than a mag. ,gtaonline,d0d48bg,16,t5_2xrd1
6708324,0,t1_d0d6s8e,one rocket destroys it no matter what angle the valkyrie is just as easy to take down with a heavy sniper rifle even easier than the hydra because its slower and bigger so you can aim at it more easily... you can even bring it down with other light weapons if the valkyrie is close... miniguns SMGs machine guns pistols... you name it the valkyrie is just as fragile as any other helicopter... same goes for the savage i thinkthats why im saying they should increase its protection it doesnt make any sense to have these helicopters be so  easy to destroy... but aparently people downvote this post maybe they cant afford a helicopter and dont like the idea of people using helicopters in free roam to kill them... but all im saying is if theres military helicopters in the game and they are so expensive better make them worth it... i didnt spend real money on them but if i bought a shark card to buy a savage or a valkyrie i would feel ripped off expecialy the Savage... ,gtaonline,d0d7550,6,t5_2xrd1

6719589,0,t3_47nb2k,That would be you. All the weapons are good for their specific use. Personally Im a huge fan of the Assault Shotgun with the extended mag. At close to medium range it destroys. And if you put the silencer on it it just makes this whiffing noise when you do which is way cool. In close combat situations take cover by a corner and then push just fire to make it fire around the corner and hose down the area with lead.Of course at long range youll be more successful throwing a blinding smile their way than trying to hit them with the AS so there you need another gun. Any of the assault rifles are good really it comes down to personal preference. Some have longer range but slower fire rate or less accuracy on full auto but high fire rate which makes them better at the up close stuff... theyre all deadly its all about how you use them.Combat MG can be very deadly also if you know how to shoot with it it knocks people down which gives you time to polish them off. Completely useless to shoot around corners with as bullets go everywhere which is logical its not a gun you can fire onehanded. AP Pistol is great in a car or indeed as a general weapon if you can headshot with some reliability it will rival an assault rifle. But the SMG is plenty good for this role also higher fire rate.Its the same story with all of it there are tradeoffs and you get to pick which you want to make. Heavy Sniper will kill a guy with one shot. If theres another guy behind the first guy it will kill that guy too. But the mag size is just  rounds and fire rate is low. The Marksman Rifle has high fire rate and a larger mag but is pretty weak and anemic you need headshots to really get much out of it. So to TLDR it there is no such thing as a best weapon. There is only the best weapon for you and you have to decide that for yourself. ,gtaonline,d0ed3v0,2,t5_2xrd1

Every single public session has a kid a literal kid who will spam explosions props vehicles npcs without cause. These have a wild range of effects from extreme lag for everyone in the session to extreme frame rate lag practically  to literally crashing your game. This also does not indicate who is actually causing this to happen. The cheater can be sitting happily in their car at the top of Chiliad or in their apartment while they do this. So any revenge you want will be a guessing game. At the peak of cheater activity it would happen within  minutes of entering a public session.

7112171,0,t3_4cxjj7,I like the possibility of being invisible on the map BUT to make it fair the tradeoff should be that you could not see others on the radar either when you are invisible. In order to track and sneak up on someone while stealthing youd need to go online on the radar to find their location for a short while and moving closer. This makes for an interesting challenge trying to anticipate where your prey is moving and when to stealth. When you choose to go offline there should be a small delay or a requirement of standing still? so it could not be abused too easily. The perfect balance would be if an experienced player could be able to sense when someone is tracking him by seeing that someone is going onoff radar nearby to know that its necessary to keep an extra eye open. In order to not make everyone be stealthed by default and thus the game world feeling too empty I feel that the stealth mode should require to be activated for each session the player enters by carrying out a specific action. It could also be tied to behavior e.g. stealth mode could be cancelled when a noisy action was performed such as shooting crashing or maybe even speeding or running red lights. If this is done right it could be a lot of fun that adds an extra layer to the game. If its done wrong Im afraid it will just lead to free mode feeling too lonely and boring.,gtaonline,d1mjzkm,3,t5_2xrd1

The doublebarrel shotgun is technically a singlebarrel automatic weapon there is only one emanation point on it for gunfire but youre going to look like a moron if you try to call it that in casual conversation.This game has a double barrel shotgun and a double action revolver.

7397975,0,t1_d2j3gus,First this new point about hackers you keep bringing up is a distraction from your original argument and totally unrelated to the point you are trying to make. In fact it works against it logically. If rockstar are greedy cunts they are then why would they let hackers run free completely destroying their in game economy and hopes to capitalize by monetizing digital currency by choice? Uhh because its not by choice. I know you like to vilify the company like a spoiled petulant child turns on their parents for the smallest gripe after being given the world. You dont know what the fuck you are talking about. Fixing and breaking script is a complex dynamic process that is not as easy as the entitled layman whiner makes it sound. Until you can actually solve the issue of cheating which plagues every online game on the planet with your own antihack code you really dont have grounds to bitch. And you clearly are ignorant as fuck as to the history of this games development if you think they havent done anything. Multiple updates have fixed glitches banned hackers removed currency and taken various other measures to combat the plague of cheaters. The reality is its like trying to catch a waterfall in a dixie cup.  There are exponentially more hackers playing GTA than there are code monkeys working for rockstar. Even if they could employ an army it wouldnt change the nature of breaking code and the reality that whatever can be built can be warped or destroyed.,gtaonline,d2j3nan,0,t5_2xrd1

7456597,0,t3_4hgqnc,It sounds clich but matte black on a car that has a good secondary trim pattern made chrome honestly does look amazing. I try to avoid it outside of one or two cars though because its a bit too common. If you wanna avoid black using a darker primary color works well in its place. My T is a dark navy blue with chrome stripes as from the secondary. Looks like a million bucks!On cars that have a nice mix of primary and secondary color patterns e.g. Brawler metallic black with secondary color that is really vivid like hot Pink or the brightest Blue works really well. It makes your car look flashy and exotic but having the primary be black helps offset the tackiness and make it look classy.Finally on larger cars like the Insurgent matte black with a Diamond Blue pearlescent looks very sharp. Appears dark as the night when the sun goes down but in the day the matte black takes on a brilliant blue luster in the sun. Very cool. And honestly matte black with bright colors as the pearlescents always looks amazing. Very silly how Rockstar doesnt let players do that by default and you have to use the glitchtrick to put pearlescents on mattes. Its some of the best paint blending Ive ever seen in a game!But finally I must give a shout out to my Banshee honestly think it came out as my best looking car. Took forever to get the livery colors to match with the colors I could paint. Ended up using several shades of greys and black to complement that single hue of blue. ,gtaonline,d2prnus,1,t5_2xrd1

7568661,0,t3_4iv85y,A fully upgraded Vindicator is king of the top speed challenge despite everyone elses bad advice. Nothing else even comes close. Find a nice straight patch of road and wheelie until youve maxed out the top speed then apply the kers boost. Make sure the kers meter is full and ride out the kers boost as straight as you possibly can to make the most of it. ProtipsWheeling allows you to exceed the topspeed of motorbikes. The Vindicator is poor at wheeling at high speed but holding down the ctrl key or controller equivalent regardless of whether the front wheel raises does give you a slight speed increase. The physics engine in GTA is weird and gives you a speed boost when the suspension of any vehicle is compressed. You may have seen skilled racers intentionally driving over curbs and bumps in the road this is known as curb boosting. Going downhill gives you a marginally higher speed. But may be useful to know. Any straight road will do but the  lane road that goes past Tinsel Towers goes downhill and the road itself is bumpy. Under the right circumstances you can reach phenomenal speeds on the vindicator. I cant believe people are even bringing up the T when the Banshee RR has a higher topspeed. Way too much misinformation in this thread. ,gtaonline,d32iq0i,3,t5_2xrd1

You enter this hardcore session and anything that you acquire while there will be lost whenever you die. There could be exclusive weapons ex. explosive rounds for minigun vehicles clothing etc. that can only be collected from within this type of session. There could be a timer and each player must remain within the session for the entire duration and whatever items you have when your timer expires is what you keep. Your money will remain safe so long as it remains in your bank. Any cash in your wallet is at risk and you cannot access your bank once youve entered this session.

7847312,0,t1_d3x75wy,I dislike it when game companies nerf parts of games based on the opinion of the lowest common denominator.Bad players are so quick to complain about things that pose the slightest challenge to them. It is almost as if players have forgotten that they are meant to be challenged. Learning to deal with and overcome those challenges is what makes games fun. In order to stop getting killed by a tank you need to drive away from it. Is that so hard to figure that out that the tank armor had to be swapped out for cardboard?Asymmetrical balancing develops dynamic gameplay. A single person should not be equally powerful as a tank or jet. Otherwise what would be the point of using those weapons?As someone who likes to fly jets I can tell you that it took a fair amount of time to afford the jet and then learn to fly well. Ive been on the receiving end of them many times and I know that its possible to fight them. Ill be damned if Rockstar decides to nerf jets based on the opinions of players who cant even get into cover effectively.  At the upper levels of skill these nerfs also just makes the game boring and unrewarding. For example most skilled racers have left this game because of the catchup system which purposefully slows down the lead car. What is the point of racing if youre going to be slowed down?Another example is the homing launcher which basically made all helicopters useless. All these compromises and nerfs just so bad players can feel a bit competitive is just hurting the games longevity and replayability among better players. We feel punished for being good at the game and that is the opposite of how games should be. ,gtaonline,d3y3v2r,0,t5_2xrd1

7890558,0,t3_4ndhhz,Pistol AP Pistol super high fire rate and damage. Definitely best drive by weapon if used correctly can be the best weapon in the game overall.SMGMG Either Gusenberg Sweeper if you have it or the Combat MG. Combat MG is best used in short bursts to counter the atrocious recoil. Range is a huge plus as well but the best part is definitely the crazy mag size though drum mags were added recently to ARs.Rifle Bullpup Rifle IMO. Though it really wont matter too much if you use the Special Carbine or tee Advanced Rifle. It really comes down to where you can place your shots the head hopefully.Sniper Heavy Sniper. One shot torso kill on anyone below rank . Perfect for long range and coordinated attacks. Marksman rifles should really only be used if you are a smallmedium distance from your target.Melee Ive always found the knives to work best for me but other than that it doesnt really matter. My personal favorite is the Machete because you look like a badass and the animations are... Interesting. Find a weapon that works for you and stick with it. Melee weapons are hardly used however.Shotgun Assault Shotgun. Crazy fire rate lets you destroy anyone that gets close to you. Perhaps not the most accurate but its a shotgun what do you expect? Special RPG for just about everything will take care of most targets. Minigun is great for semilong range and for dealing heavy damage to jets if used correctly. Can also counter Insurgents in free aim lobbies.Throwable Sticky bombs! Mines work well when retreating from a battle however as they detonate automatically. For targets on roofs I always use grenades.EDIT Added a bit more detail to most categories.,gtaonline,d42yzyf,17,t5_2xrd1

7941171,0,t1_d489fwp,I think people would actually do DMs if they paid better and were actually fun compared to fighting on your own terms.Its not fun at all to leave the infinitely flexible lobby that is a public session all the various toys and tactics to queue up to then do battle in what usually amounts to a tiny area alleyway or wide open are  of DMs Ive done. I dont do the gimmicky crap I mostly do R DMs because custom DMs are usually BS scamsrigged.The DM mechanics suck. Were forced offradar yet you can just spam Lester over and over. The combat in this game doesnt really feel good like this  Autoaim because it feels like camp to win and I dont want to do free aim because thats like  of the player base tops. You pretty much have to spam Lesters Reveal Players because the top guy on the other team is and hell win if you dont because hell backshoot all your team as they play hide and seek.You have death streaks that reward losing and they actually punish you for kill streaks. Blurry vision permanently revealed rewards to kill the power player and sometimes they make you take X damage. All while the noob who kept making himself cannon fodder gets quad damage and instakills you. Thats not fun at all. I dont want to be punished for leading the match. Races do the same if you dont change the defaults catchupslipstream combo  Ive lapped the whole track just to go to th in the last  seconds which shouldnt be possible.I really dont want to deal with forced weapons pickups even less. Every Rank  these days has a Bullpup Rifle Homing Launcher and Marksman Rifle but lets have a Pistol only fight in a boxed in alleyway where despite the obscene costs Ive spent over the  years Ive played on ammo I get  reload. This means get to the best pickup st for easy kills and if you give me a Combat MG vs Uzis and Pistols I may as well be modding because I used to wreck entire lobbies during launch by going to Survival and getting the Combat MG UziPistol  no chance in hell.If you get through all of this and manage to win youre probably not even making K in  minutes not counting the queue timefinding players and now youre at the vote screen and half the screen is parachuting matches and you watch  of the lobby bail immediately. You then realize you could have done a VIP Work or two and made K by the time you give up and waited for one match won it waited for another in vain and then you could have had a battle on your own terms without any queue time and if you didnt like it just leave passive if needed and find another player to fight who can leavepassive if they dont want to.I used to play the same  maps TDM  kills for months and months on BF so it doesnt take much to make a DM map fun. I had fun doing that but I just dont get any enjoyment whatsoever out of DMs in GTAO and the reward for any competitive job in this game is an insult even double money theyre still terrible compared to VIPMissionsHeists much moreso if you arent winning  of the time and nobody wins  of the time. DMs just fail to take advantage what makes GTAO unique leaving them a really terrible version of what I could be doing in any FPS in a much more fun form. With Freeroam your fights can be unlike any of these FPS games.,gtaonline,d48ntxl,8,t5_2xrd1

When grinding missions and boy oh boy did I used to only play this game to grind missions the loading times for finding new sessions starting the missions going back to free roam to host a mission ect. all slowed down the money making progress. With VIPCEO work its all in one lobby and you can do stuff over and over again without having to load into a whole new session just to select a certain mission.

8080547,0,t1_d4obaif,gt It isnt fun because a business no matter now illegal it is is suppose to make money.I dunno I find the crate buy missions fun for the most part  particularly when it ends well despite all the odds. That hydra griefer I was talking about earlier chased me into a warehouse on my Bati   I got lucky and it was a personalcarry crate instead of a vehicle I had to commandeer. That part was fun but the fact that this bellend would kill you in his Hydra then fuck off before you could retaliate as soon as I started shooting back with a minigun he was gone was the only thing that made it not fun.As long as Ive got enough money and arent tending towards zero I really dont care about the money because if you want to save up to buy something its all work.gt Where the hell is the balance when some dickwad in a single lone Hydra can torch up  mln dollars worth of cargo that takes an average of  hours to collect in mere moments?Eject the disc AltF kill the game or unplug your internet straight away if this happens and that m loss becomes at worst a k loss at best a loss of maybe  minutes seriously all the times Ive lost crates on a sell mission the primary penalty is that fucking loading screen.gt Real business is risky but this is a fantasy crime kingpin simulator. The risk isnt suppose to be so bad that it makes someone stop playing altogether.TBH if getting your crates blown up and again unless they patch it forcequitting the game before it has a chance to save means you dont actually lose much or anything is enough to make you quit playing you probably shouldnt be doing it. People have shown that unless the stars align running heists with a good group is hands down a better safer way to make money.gt Thats why  friendly CEOs initiating a peace pact is one of the more beautiful sights you can witness first hand. Its like very tiny any colonies sharing the same ant mound with no conflict.gt If theres no conflict everyone benefits. Warehouses fill faster VIP Work gets done quickly Associates get paid more frequently and Sell Missions go down with no hassle the CEO gains huge and everyone is sociable.I agree entirely and thats how I like to play for the most part. I blew up one truck and one plane because the game told me to prior to becoming a CEO and then I noticed the reward wasnt really worth the effort. When I became a CEO I realised that the costs of causing a friendly lobby to turn hostile is absolutely not worth it whatsoever so now I only go hostile when someones being an asshole first.I can see the allure in playing the other way too but its not good sense financially. If finances are what make you play this game you have to play it a certain way or give up. This isnt a good update financially but as I said earlier I dont really think it was supposed to be  I think this update is primarily for rich adrenaline junkies and it probably doesnt hurt that those who arent rich ingame but have disposable incomes will payplay via Shark Cards I dont think it was ever marketed as a safe way to make guaranteed cash.,gtaonline,d4obufn,2,t5_2xrd1

8110143,0,t1_d4rmnqd,The Xfactor in content is how the players will use it. You never know for sure what the effect of adding or changing one thing will have when used in conjunction with everything else. They probably never intended the Hydra to be used to harass other players to the degree it is anyway. Look at single player where you dont deal with other players and the game is fantastic. Introduce the human PvP element and it changes everything because people are looking for exploits and glitches. Pac Standard Kuruma for example.gt The last  times in a row R released something there was a major glitch or issue upsetting the balance of the game or making new content broken or unplayable.I think you might be referring most recently anyway to CEO content. I disagree that its broken. People hate the publiconly aspect of it but Id say it works as intended for the most part. You see occasional glitches lost crates etc. There are many reasons outside of the content that could lead to that stuff connection issues Xbox live issues mods. Or maybe the fact that people are trying to hackforce their way into empty sessions. But the stuff still works as intended most of the time. Also free DLC is a rarity these days. Soak it up.Theyre just not going to cater to what the loudest and whiniest players want. Theyre going to make the game according to their vision with some feedback playing a role of course. But I cant stand all the complaining about this and that. This car is too fast this car is not fast enough. The safe doesnt do anything. How come I cant buy Franklins house.

The T feels like it has a bit more weight to it but you may prefer how light it feels. I think its the rd best super in the game? X is the best if youre wondering but not by much. Most supers are good.Turismo R  To me this one is similar to the Osiris. Really light but like I said you may prefer that. Its a good one but not as fast as the T or Osiris. Still quick for the price though.Reaper  Havent driven this much but I enjoyed it. It handles a bit weird though. Its decent. Youre best off trying this in a race. FMJ  This one has a lot of traction. I enjoy it. Feels easy to drive too. Very good for the price.  This is the one that doesnt have great tractionhandling. The other ones you listed all have good traction but not this one. It has the fastest top speed in the game. It wont help you in a race. Id say buy this only if you really like it.

Making a small amount of progress towards the drop every time.The th or th time I killed him went offradar to buy some time and create distance.  I was around grove street at the time.  My brickade got stuck on the small almost invisible rails in between the dies of the road where the train tracks are.I did not see the train coming.  It was just a luck of the draw moment.

We could if we wanted simulate the entire world different countries whatever.He could literally be talking about any aspect of the game as it launched in the prelaunch quote. Hell based on that quote he could have been saying We could make a topdown GTA that has every city weve ever shown in it including some new ones.

8591883,0,t1_d6fa1i6,I dont know where the fuck a Texas city got into the mix but I think its going to be Vice City. And why? Well in GTA  there is an amusement park and one of the rides has the back ground that looks eerily similar to the skyline of Los Santos from one of the trailers. Also there are billboards tshirts and beach towels I think that had messages such as  I heart LS and stuff like that.Looking at GTA  now and seeing if there are any clues and the beach towels say I heart VC. Havent found any other clues yet but its similar to the clues found in GTA  that hinted at Los Santos being the next GTA. That and R has also indicated that each city would get a a version in each generation. The d universe was VCLSLC. And the HD universe which started with GTA  was Liberty City. GTA  was Los SantosSan Andres. So it seems likely GTA  will be Vice Cities version in the HD universe.Who ever said it was Texas was talking out of their ass.Also I would like to mention that yes the connections come from a Mr. Clickbait FTW videos that was actually a decent video before the click bait shitfest started.,gtaonline,d6fkqk2,0,t5_2xrd1

It ruins Car vs. Car PvP encounters. Instead of having high stakes chases shooting out the tires of your opponent or killing the driver leaving the passengers to quickly take control The local Yokels bought it! we get a cheap Instakill for everyone in the car. Possible with only one bomb unless you buy an insurgent or one of the CEO vehicles. Videos of Gta online day  will give you a glimpse of a stickybombless utopia and you can see how much better the PvP encounters were. It would have been better off left as a singleplayer mechanic.

The Brickade mission where I had to use trackify.. The Tugboat mission where the only enemies were cholos on the docks.. The Titan drop mission. No enemies encountered.The large warehouse missions were. Brickade mission where I had to deal with  jeep driving Merryweather Mercs. Total of  mercs.. Brickade mission where I had to dropoff to five drops. Had to deal with a police sting wherein I used the CEO Bribe.. Brickade Mission where I had to use Trackify. Weird thing is my dropoff point was the same place is in the first Brickade mission.. Tugboat where once again I only had to face cholos on the docks.. Titan Mission with  drops once again with no enemies.. Titan Mission with  drops  of which must be done before the fifth is revealed. The fifth drop became a three star wanted level when I entered the airspace. Have to lose the wanted level before the mission would properly end and save. No enemies to evade.I just feel these arent random. It feels like a cycle. Its actually driving me crazy that I havent had to deal with the Buzzards yet. I read a tactic which is to enter the Titan exit the Titan and jump into a buzzard fly over all the point until you find the enemy and kill them. Fly back to Titan and finish.

8645438,0,t1_d6ma6ld,It depends on the size warehouse you have. If you have a small warehouse you could do small shipments rather easily since it only holds  crates. This is good for getting a feel for picking up crates and such. If you have a medium warehouse you kinda need to do medium shipments at the bare minimum. This means that sometimes youll have to pick up two crates at a time but if you have a relatively fast car youll be fine. I highly recommend that you get used to medium shipments before you even think about getting large ones and when you do move up to large ones do it with your medium warehouse. If you have a large warehouse youll have to get large shipments lest you burn yourself out.Ive found that to guarantee successful pick ups of large shipments when you have to pick up the individual crates youll need a helicopter. If you dont own one you can steal a Maverick from the nearest helipad though if youre a level  theres a chance a Buzzard will span there.Speaking of The Buzzard youll want to buy one ASAP youll need it if you want to be successful.EDIT Keep in mind that from the moment the crates show up on the radar youll have  minutes to get your crates to the warehouse or else theyll be counted as lost. Try getting your helicopter of you dont own a Buzzard before getting your crates so it doesnt eat up what time you have.,gtaonline,d6mahk1,2,t5_2xrd1

The most frustrating thing is that the color seems to lock to certain checkpoints in the color spectrum i.e. you cant necessarily get any or an exact rgbhex because even if you set it to that it will snap to the nearest checkpoint.One idea I had for why this would be that way is to prevent the creation of crew colors that look too close to existing purchaseable colors.

8983950,0,t1_d7rf0ji,Dont know why you would be downvoted for saying what happened to you. The same thing happened to me. When I wrote for support with documentation of the offer and purchase Rockstars response letter which I posted to Reddit a while back if anyone wants to search my comment history for it explicitly stated my existing bank balance was too large it was then M to be given the rebate and that I should spend more dollars to get my bank balance lower. I have subsequently reduced my bank balance from its high point M to a little over M. Still never received the rebate even though like you I was told it would be automatically deposited as soon as my bank balance dropped to some unspecified qualifying low point.The ironic thing here is that like some posters above I had decided I wanted to support Rockstar by occasionally buying Shark Cards but knowing they offered frequent rebates I decided to only buy them during rebate periods. This unwritten policy of withholding rebates if bank balances are larger than they want you to have only referred to vaguely in support messages is causing me to refrain from purchasing another card even though I was willing to buy one every month or so.I just did a slow burn last night when I received the ingame email of the new rebate offer and saw the loading screens enticing me to buy a Shark Card and receive up to a  rebate. Fool me once... is now all I can think of when I see these offers.Rockstar has screwed themselves out of revenue I was freely willing to give them due to a ridiculous undocumented policy of not giving promised rebates to people who like to carry reasonably large balances in their GTA bank accounts.Make no mistake I love this game and greatly enjoy playing it which in my very politely and respectfullyworded support request I made clear to Rockstar by the way but I wont be buying another Shark Card unless Rockstar either publically documents the limitations to the rebate program or stops withholding rebates from people who qualified for them but didnt get them because of this foolish and completely undocumented policy.,gtaonline,d7rqe70,1,t5_2xrd1

9037361,0,t1_d7y2thg,WAY too many to count. My first approach was just knocking out the  guys closest to the start point and working my way to the back so I studied all of the enemies in that order. Once I worked my way to the enemies in the back and noticed that those enemies were too stationary to manipulate into making themselves more vulnerable I realized that I had to take a different approach. One way that required the use of both team lives was to take out the guy with the micro SMG first run back to the start point run through the enemies in the usual order and die on purpose right after I knocked out the guy by the burntout car. Then attacking the  in the grass while they werent aggressive due to my death and respawning. Finally once I ran for cover from the last  remaining by the SUV I ran around behind the buildings and used the SUV for cover to take out those last . Then I had to figure out how to best work out how to manipulate the hoard of enemies that come when the Dominator is collected. My first instinct was to use the method that I settled on because I noticed how enemies are so easily manipulated by the various sections in that area. However I did attempt a few other areas to lead them to for manipulation. The first was the Fire Stations training building but that had mixed results. The first time I tried it I was able to get them to climb in through the nd story window  by  but the times I tried it after that they wouldnt climb through same with higher stories. The next thing I tried was to lead them to a stairwell of the nearby parking garage in hopes to just knock them out  by  as they came up to the nd set of stairs but they too often rushed me in pairs so that proved to be inconsistent and unpredictable. I even tried climbing to the top of the large tower close to the Dominator but it took too long to get to the top and I died more often than not. All of these methods were tested independently from my  bat usage runs I either snuck the Dominator away with minimal damage to test or shot my way to it. This approach saved some time in my testing but the entire process was test after test for about a WEEK because I was constantly learning something new about the behavior of the enemies. For example in my video youll notice near the beginning at the only time I put a helmet on that the melee attackers stop advancing when Im on my motorcycle and continue when I get off... up until a point where they get closer when they only advance on me  at a time. I didnt actually figure that out completely until that recording or just a few attempts before it. I find it interesting to see all the ways that these enemies can be manipulated and just playing with that took up the greatest amount of attempts and time devoted to this personal challenge.,gtaonline,d7y5bh2,4,t5_2xrd1

Hitting something at low speed on my bike then being tossed off faster than I was riding. Not being able to make  of the outfits I want due to multiple oversightsomissions in garment compatibility. Calling in vehicles from my mechanic or SecuroServe only to have them placed in inconvenient locations. Getting run over by an NPC driver who speeds off and derezzes before Im on my feet again. The fact theres no separate volume for ingame voices so I have to mute my TV whenever my secretary speaks or I call MORS or when LJT calls every five fucking seconds and just endure being constantly cursed at by NPCs. That theres no way to win against cops. The random ways the game nerfs vehicle performance to ensure you hit someone or something. The many ways the game sends traffic bouncing into you at every opportunity. The fact that driving any car is  about forward momentum and  trying to prevent the car from spinning around backwards and stopping. Cant buy armor remotely. No customizable penthouses outside of Eclipse Towers. No stilt houses in Chumash or Paleto Bay. Some hedges you can drive through others you cant. Some bushes you can drive through others hide tree stumps. Motherfucking aimbot. Rockstar patching perfectly fine clothing glitches like wearing the new biker mask with something other than those giant helmets. Its a very adult game featuring brutal violence drug usetrafficking prostitutes oral sex anal sex torture strippers constant cursing boobs in multiple locations shirtcocking and bareass guys up in the mountains and perverted imagery everywhere ... yet theres a profanity filter even the LDS would say goes too far I cant drink or get high while driving and I cant run around naked because children play the game. Oh yeah CHILDREN PLAY THE GAME. Cant clean up my office. Fucking Lamar mission icon wont go away. Ive been Online for almost two years now and have  characters with  and  ranks yet Im still getting alerts telling me how to leave a garage to kill myself to deposit my cash and a dozen other things I mastered on day ONE. Still cant have separate bank accounts for characters. Still cant experiment with color combinations at LSC before paying for them.  Still no new matte or metal colors. Can only put Bennys custom wheels on a handful of cars. No new music in ages and no Self radio for console players. Manana Peyote Emperor overlooked for lowriders. But theres a minivan. So far only two Bennys racing cars. FUTO OWNER MAD. That THIS welldone but phony trailer hasnt been purchased and integrated into the game yet even though it hasnt been a month since it was posted. No liftkits for pickups no removal of liftkit on Sandking. Kill a guy he poops out a banded stack of cash ...  maximum. No PVE mode for public sessions. No compromise on publicsessiononly CEO and MC work.  No countermeasures or effective antiHydra weapon for the  of players who cant shoot them down with sniper rifles. No character customization deeper than hair makeup clothing. Things that stick out of the ground or poke out of walls or any other small protrusion that causes you to stop or spin out. That cars seem to lose  of their mass while airborne. That you cant autoaim NPCs in vehicles as in story mode. That a ton of automatic gates are locked closed online that only a could of lift gates work and that a number of breakable story mode fences are rock solid online. That I cant own garage and customize a Jobuilt Phantom. That combat land vehicles still have to be stored and delivered by Pegasus despite being able to spawn them right next to you if youre a VIP or CEO. Still no Pegasus vehicle customization not even color. Rednecks shoot at me for no reason no cops show up. I shoot back in selfdefense cops show up and shoot ME.Okay I have to go.

The more you network the more likely youll end up in a lobby with people on your side and the more people you play with in a familiar fashion the more you get to know their style and trust in their capabilities. This is cool because it makes mission cohesion THAT much easier and makes success much more probable. ,gtaonline,d9hfhxz,1,t5_2xrd1

9602577,0,t1_d9wo2ve,No Im being downvoted because retards cant read dont know what the word context means and they take the merest hint that their million  purchase might not be completely flawless in every way as a mortal insult. If you pay attention youll notice I said nothing about its lap times.Since you insist I will talk about them. Firstly considering lap times to be the one and only yardstick by which bikes are measured is only acceptable if all you want to do with the bike in question is race. If you want to use it outside of races such narrow view is idiotic. Secondly the lap time you refer to is measured by one guy around one track. Sample size of one is generally almost meaningless around other tracks and with other drivers the results may well be very different.What I actually said is that the Drag corners badly and that it cant go over obstacles both of which are absolutely true. Yes the lap times are close around that one track but thats because the Drag makes it up on the straights and there are no obstacles to go over in races. If all you want is a racing bike and youre willing to base your purchasing decision on one test performed by one guy by all means go for the cheaper slightly less ludicrously expensive option. Under any other circumstance youd be a moron to choose it over the Shotaro unless you really really dig the looks of it.,gtaonline,d9wppsg,-18,t5_2xrd1

For this to be a simulator it would have to have driving physics closer to games like Forza and Gran Turismo and not handle like its in a fampf movie or a cartoon or something and have more realistic calculations for things like bullet drop instead of having your bullet  hit exactly where you aim no matter what and just disapear off the face of the earth if the distance is too far not that it even actually ever existed in the game to begin with its basically just an invisible laser that does damage if it happens to land on you.,gtaonline,d9zxhoq,1,t5_2xrd1

Back when FampF came out claims of false positives started trickling in more and more I was banned myself. Yet people cursed them and accused them of the same old bullshit but guess what? There was a problem with the anticheat and most of those bans were overturned. Mine was removed within  hours. Im sure many of these people are probably guilty of something. But so far everytime Ive seen claims spike like this there was a problem with the anticheat.And regardless of whether or not these claims are true Rockstar has its head up its ass. There are hard core modders who are still doing their thing who have huge bank accounts. A kid I know has six billion dollars. I just knew hed be one of those banned.. Nope Hes running free still. A lot of people assume Rockstar has some sophisticated system to figure out whos cheating who has legitimate money when in reality? It seems more like the anticheat is a half blind man playing whack a mole with mixed results.Rockstar has LEGITIMIZED peoples modded money. Taking their millions that theyd not banked for fear of being banned and banking it for them.. WTF? And frankly complete progress wipes for all offenses is bullshit. I know people whove been banned for swearing in chat in the past. Theyre attempting to rely on absolute fear to make people behave whether its cheaters asshats or other offenders.

Ive been known to steal a big rig and go searching log decks for trailers and deliver them to the saw mill in Paleto just on a lark...itd be fun fresh and I think pay ballanced to have a time limit and a continuously decreasing payout until delivery.Ive been noticing lately that the inability to run concurrent VIPMC limits cooperation and encourages PVP even among those that would rather be playing more cooperatively and that free mode could really use a revamp  have player dots off by default unless theyre playing a PvP game or have it set to show in the interaction menu friendsassociatesetc allow concurrent missions some form of free mode contact missions that arent associated w VIPMC...set payouts however but I for one would really like there to be more to do w purposeearningbraggingrights while waiting for some min PvP game to finish.,gtaonline,daemv04,1,t5_2xrd1
9751179,0,t3_5esxks,You cant separate them.  . mil is a good start but I wouldnt recommend blowing it on an office.  You still need a warehouse and really to earn money fast doing CEO stuff you need a buzzard which is another . mil and you have to be rank  i think.  Instead I would spend it on one of the cheapest apartments you can run heists out of and get a decent lower cost car.  Find  more friends and do the heists.  You can all earn an extra  million each by doing all the heists in order with the same crew.  Plus the heist earnings are pretty good too. It will take a while but the heists are fun and you dont have to deal with griefers during them.  Also when you start gta online I recommend turning on passive mode a lot of the time as you explore so people cant mess with you.  Then disable passive just when you want to participate in something you cant do in passive mode.  There is a lot to learn about gta online and you are in the right place.  Read some of the guides here.  It really is not that intuitive.  Id say it takes a few s of hours to really learn the ins and outs but when you do its a lot of fun especially if you have friends who play regularly.,gtaonline,daf1rje,5,t5_2xrd1

I wouldnt expect a refund just be a more savvy shopper next time and pay attention to trends.

When a majority of option is overpowered you dont buff the minority you still nerf majority.When a minority of option is underpowered you buff minority.When a majority of option is underpowered you dont nerf the minority you still buff majority.And you gonna have to be able to tell what is overpowered and what is underpowered.Always look for the root problem and cause if you try to fix something. When house has pest problem go clean up your kitchen instead of asking for pest control. With how the metas of CEO crates going there is really no point in using a turreted limo over a buzzard you could insert basically everything in place of turreted limo and it will work. They just gotta remove the buzzard from CEO spawn menu and increase the pay out of each crate sale price. People are not going to like it when their stuff get taken away but for the sake of balance its just better. You get paid more per crate but at a slower pace that essentially change nothing. However you are free to use any vehicles you want instead of the buzzard if you want to maximize your efficiency.

Its only really useful if you wanna play solo and prefer holding W to get home instead of actually weaving through traffic.Whats sad is that it would be super useful with CEO cargo pickups cause those fucking vehicles are SLOOOOW whereas the IE sports cars you pick up are really fast.,gtaonline,db6cq0u,5,t5_2xrd1
9964170,0,t1_db5wd3c,ive only ever played two MMOs before GTA Online if its still even categorized as such Runescape and Dungeon Fighter Online. in both cases endgame pretty much becomes a lonely solo grindfest to outcapitalize the next guy. only difference between GTA Online and those other games is that you pretty much only need a Hydra to hold your own in free roam and maybe a Buzzard for CEO work if you decide to delve into that. everything else is just fluff. cant tell you how many people were surprised at how sparse my first and only car garage is with the only vehicle of note being an Entity XF. materialism for the most part does not get you geared in this game.yeah the obvious pushing of Shark Cards is scummy as fuck but even if CEO and MC work were designed better or hell the game as a whole i still dont really see anyone other than efficiency fiends profiting much.,gtaonline,db6cvlc,2,t5_2xrd1

9970031,0,t1_db73h04,Exactly. Im sure theres some way humanly possible to make more per hour doing crates than these cars but the amount of time money and planning it will take is exponentially greater. For max profits with crates you need  Roughly  Mill to spend on large warehouses  Another  to spend on the Buzzard  Another  to spend on  crates  those crates take  hours to collect  then you have to find a full lobby  pray that that lobby is friendly and wont attack you  then hope all goes well with the delivery missions. One false move and youre completely screwed. So basically you need to go  in the hole just to buy and fill the warehouses and if all goes perfectly after  hours youll get the full  in cash and bonuses. Which means you have to do it ALL AGAIN just to get your money back. Thats  hours spent on crates just to break even. THEN you can do it a rd time to actually make money .M. So at the  hour mark you have finally made . Mill. Compare ALL of that to just doing ImportExport for  hours at  per and youre at . Plus as you mentioned its a hell of a lot more fun and youre getting a regular income as you go and can stop any time you want without having to make a  hour commitment before you see a single dime. ,gtaonline,db74egn,3,t5_2xrd1

I have completed about  sale runs between my two businesses.  There is a lot of money to be made and it can all be done solo possibly.  Supply missions with one friend make things a ton easier.  Sale missions also for that fact.  And if you sell a load for k your MC members who helped with get at k!    The supply missions are very helpful with a Buzzard but a lot require a driver and sometimes a  mile drive in a awful vehicle.  Prepare for that no matter if your business is in the city or in the desert.   Some tips for supply missions  Use buzzard rocket to knock bikers off bikes.  Use Armored Kuruma for getting wanted levels and waiting on NPC to arrive.  Use sticky bomb on a bike or bull shark testosterone for the Tequilala mission.    Tips for sell missions solo  Quit if you see the UPS box truck.  Even a local delivery may not be possible.  Garbage truck takes a long time possible to complete out of county delivery but it is very tight and need Buzzard for return to other vehicles.  Anything over  bars of product is  delivery vehicles.  ,gtaonline,db8jwbt,1,t5_2xrd1

Then online took off.  million players a week!  years after release!!I promise you R didnt see that coming. Then some wiseass said lets do SharkCards! And money was made. Hand over fist money was made. THAT changed the arc of GTAO more than anything. OP isnt wrong the game HAS become one big grind. Everything a poster listed as different activities are just different types of grinds. I think the first  months of online were fantastic. Thru Heists.  But everything after that was designed to sell SharkCards. Not for the players enjoyment.Its not entitlement that ruined GTA it was R.

10156037,1,t3_5lf6qp,I have owned TREBTyrus Nero custom Tempesta.. I have raced a lot lately and gotten pretty good. Very very rarely place below top . My experience is this. The REB is the fastest around a track no doubt. But the others are close enough that it doesnt matter. However the REB is really boring to drive. The sound of it the feel of it and I dont like the looks either. And it is not a great freemode cruiser in my opinion. It grew old fast and I sold it some time ago. Never regretted it. That car has no soul.The tempests is getting some praise now but I didnt like it either. The handling felt weird and the front lights look odd. Sold that one as well no regrets.Progen Tyrus might be my favorite racer. It is fast enough to compete with all the others and it feels much more involved and real to drive than the othersin my opinion. The sound is wicked too it sounds like an angry beast of a race car. Definitely had the most fun driving this car and it is fun in freemode too. It wont stop being fun and interesting to drive.Nero custom is also good. Its pretty fast seems faster than my Tyrus around a track and it is alright to drive. I like how it drives better than the TREB or tempesta easily. I also really love the looks of it. The looks is why Im now using this more in races than my Tyrus. Also love to drive it in freemode since it has a good balance of being speedy nice to drive and also is a bit calmer and more civilized than the Tyrus.Dont just buy the car that is the fastest around a track. It is much better to get the one you will enjoy driving the most. They are all close enough in performance anyway. My winloss record hasnt seen a change after I switched from REB to Tyrus and Nero custom. Skillgtgtgt car choice.If I have to recommend specific cars go for the Tyrus. Or Nero Custom. Or the Etr. Never owned an ETR but it looks good sounds good and is alright to drive imo. Forget about the REB. Boring soulless car.Edit you had  specific cars in mind. My recommendation then is easily the Tyrus. nd place would be X but it is definitely not a car on my top list. Again forget about  the REB x,gtaonline,dbv8rlw,3,t5_2xrd1

After that all you will get is the top tier cars. Since youll be playing solo when you export select specialist dealer there is an upfront cost of k to mod the car however you are paid k upon a perfect delivery with the car in mint condition. So profit is at most k with damages from importing cars still to be considered.selling solo will give you a cool down of  minutes. So you can get  cars per hour. So average about kk per hour of money. However you can just buy the supplies to your cocaine business and do IE stuff while it produces product.

10202880,0,t3_5lzihr,I think this bike has the potential to be really cool looking in the hands of someone who understands what its options are supposed to be and how to mix and match them properly. On the other hand it could easily be an ugly chimeric beast for those people who always pick whatever customization options are at the bottom or most expensive see everyone who puts xenon lights on every single car every youtuber ever goes straight for the limo tint glass same and selects the bottom largest spoiler in the list for every car.It can be a cafe racer. It can be a retro crotch rocket. It can be a roughnrowdy scout bike. I like them all and I honestly might end up buying another one.That said performance? Its just okay. I did a casual race against a Zentornodriving friend through the city and up the coast and found that I easily widened the gap in town but as soon as we hit the open straights the FCR  was just plain slow.Akuma and Bati  are both better as are many other bikes. I havent tested but I feel confident the Ruffian is better and you can get that bike for free. But if you want a motorcycle that has one of those vibes I mentioned before and youre able to enjoy something that isnt truly  competitive I recommend it. If you have performance and usefulness as your main priorities skip it and save up for a Drag and a Shotaro.My main complaint is trivial. I just wish the default headlight wasnt so unnaturally bluewhite. I feel the scout bike look needs a nice classic yellowish lamp.,gtaonline,dc0jxqr,3,t5_2xrd1

Many other games are unplayable for me because Im just simply not fast enough to keep up with players that have CounterStrike flowing through their veins and pumped into their brains via Twitch on their second monitor. CoD Battlefield CS I cant play any of these games anymore because while I think theyre all really fun and Id love to play them the amount of uptime I have as a casual or commuting player to those games just doesnt pay off for me in the long run fun factor of playing.Sounds like youre playing on Controller? If you have mouse and keyboard available via the PC version of the game give that a shot. Im sure youve tried it already or considered it.GTAO for me is on PC but I tend towards controller as the analog sticks feel better for vehicle navigation. Im usually battling NPCs anyway and not other players. NPC behavior is a little more predictable lowering the skill requirements for aiming.Anyway bummer to hear that the game is getting stale for you in these aspects. Hop in a race! D.

People who go after CEOMC endeavors particularly via Hydras are sometimes referred to as SharkCardSalesmen for a reason. At least you have some goddamn dignity. More than can be said of most griefers we tend to come across.Crates MC businesses and ImportExport are fundamentally broken imho. I get that its all about running on risk but the risks are far too high considering how little CEOs and MCs generally have in the way of defense compared to the up to  other people in the session. Riskreward is good but not when theres that kind of money money that could have been paid for with real money mind you isnt that technically gambling? on the line and especially not when other players are fully and shamelessly utilizing such unfair advantages. Youre almost always gonna get SOMEone hating on you because of that especially with the potential return for cargo destruction being so laughably abysmal but again at least you have some dignity.,gtaonline,dcznld0,3,t5_2xrd1

As such the differences between the AE and AE was that the AE had a  wheel disk brakes an LSD and a DOHC engine while the AE had rear drums an open diff and a SOHC engine.The Karin Futo clearly has a DOHC engine it says Limited Slip Differential on the side and you can see the  disk brakes under the rims indicating it is a AE.Not to mention most importantly the infamous silver and black top AGE motors had  valves while the AEs AU had v. On the Karin Futo Inline v RWD is clearly written on the side and there is a motor with a silver top in the engine bay.In addition to the above the AEs AU carbureted motor redlined at rpm the silvertop AGE at rpm. The Karin Futos redline is unknown as it goes off the dial but it goes past the  mark before it does so on the tachometer.  By all respects the Karin Futo is an AE in Levin trim and coupe body style.,gtaonline,dd4till,4,t5_2xrd1

For sports go for the free Elegy as someone else said its pretty much the best and u should only consider other sport cars when you have money left to spend.

11065347,0,t1_dem6g8n,Lol one at a time!gtWhat exactly is the trick there? Going as high as possible and even looping when theres an opportunity?In the st tube go pretty high on the nd corner not as high as possible though and swing down that will swing you up to the left. Tap the left stick as you hit the boost which should swing you all the way around nicely to exit the tube downwards. In the second tube you can do the same as the first tube but I find it too risky because the boost is the last piece of the tube. Like in this lap just swing up to the left again slowly until you are in the middle of the left side and then tap the stick right at the last moment to exit the tube downwards.gtDo the tires matter for doing itI havent noticed any real difference and I have extensively used off roads High ends etcgt are you short shifting?I dont know what that is so Ill say No??EDIT just googled short shifting. Interesting concept but no I certainly havent been doing that haha.gtIs the REB quickest for you? Have you tried the Nero Custom or the X?The Nero custom steers a bit too stiff so its possible to do these tricks but way harder. The regular corners are a lot easier in the REB also.

11133039,0,t3_5yyseb,gt Multiple people coming and going from the same doors in apartment building garages and lobbies make sense because thats how they work and with a yacht yours is right there on the water alongside everyone elses.gt This is mechanically impossible with mansions. It would be completely impossible for the game to convince you that the driveway grounds and house itself are yours. Theyll never offer the same exclusivity and privacy as a yacht or penthouse.It works for stilt houses doesnt it? Theyre unique the front door lead directly to the personal space and no one has an issue with that.ampnbspgt Id much rather see the development time and resources spent on adding features to the yachts.They hardly ever change what already exists though. They add more stuff on top of the previous stuff but I cant see them reworking interior and exterior layouts.ampnbspFor me the biggest issue with mansions is that not two of them have the same exterior layout so each would need a dedicated interior set whereas stilt houses all share the same basic exterior layout with a few minor variations which allows the devs to basically use the same interior set for all of them again with minor variations.,gtaonline,detx47i,42,t5_2xrd1

Some sessions seem normal.  Others theres a guy who is invincible... sometimes you randomly get ALL weapons with full ammo granted by some random player.  Just a bit ago I suddenly had SNOWBALLS in my inventory along with everything else... The other day it was every pedestrian who died on the street suddenly gave  cash.  What the fuck?  Seriously the game is STILL unplayable for anyone serious about gaming.   gtgtImagine World of Warcraft where some random jackass could give every player online tons of gold and whatever armor they wanted.  What is the point of playing the game if you dont have to earn what you have????gtgtIts really upsetting I just started loving this game and felt myself wanting to spend the time building up an MC becoming CEO etc... and now it feels like there is no point.  gtgtgtgtTLDR GAME INTEGRITY IS IMPORTANT!!! FIX THIS SHIT GOD FUCKING DAMNIT gtgtEDIT Talking about PC versionUnfortunately they cant.  Any cheat protection is reactive instead of proactive due to the nature of peertopeer connections. In your example you use world of warcraft that uses servers which allows blizzard to inplement proper cheat protection due to the ability to strictly control incoming and outgoing data along with the ability to monitor said data,gtaonline,df5somc,8,t5_2xrd1

11398059,0,t1_dfnvnjc,Filling a warehouse takes literal hours. Usually across multiple days. Its pretty fucking infuriating and obnoxious to see that time wasted because someone felt like having fun with complete disregard for how much time they just wasted for the CEO with a few rounds. Also consider how extremely unfair it is. Deliveries have to be done in particular vehicles with almost zero defensive capabilities. Its piss easy to make a CEOs efforts worthless and they have to start all over again using up even more of their time. This is the kind of stuff that makes people stop playing.There is a reason I use task manager to get into a lobby by myself and my friends and I kick people when they come in.

11407541,0,t1_dfozufs,Except Rockstar made CEO and Biker work PvE by implementing NPC enemies while making PvP a potential aspect of it. Each CEOBiker cargovehiclesupply pickup and deliveries have a PvE challenge excepting vehicle deliveries with other players present so admittedly PvP bothers me less there. I personally feel that Rockstar fucked the PvP aspect. Now see I can say that because I like the game I just have reservations about some aspects so I avoid them. Otherwise the game completely supports me playing PvE if I so happen to be myself or playing with just my father. PvP as it is is potentially  on  or  on  one team has slow vehicles plus potential escort the other team has whatever they have. This is not engaging PvP to me simple as that.Youre assuming that just because youre having fun on your end that must mean everyone is. Considering people on this sub actively seek empty lobbies this is far from the case. Youre getting fun out of wasting other players time for next to no reward. This makes you a dick to other players.I can enjoy the game but think they fumbled PvP hard. Thats why I go into my own lobbies. If I couldnt I likely would have stopped playing months ago.

You learn to spot potential trouble spots and deal with them like never putting yourself between a car and a road it may turn onto at the last moment and staying away from turn lanes when approaching intersections. For the cross traffic programed to ram you at intersections I dont know how to describe it but they have an obvious tell once you notice itwhereas most traffic is smooth and fluid the ones programed to hit you at intersections are more jerky in their movement.

11591717,0,t1_dg9nqr7,lol there was a time I would wake up boot and play till I got drowsy. Now that I own everything make little effort to make cash MC buis only I still end up with another million in my account balance every  ingame hrs and I still spend most of my freetime messing around in freemode.Look sourcing the cars takes me anywhere from  to  minutes so say an average of  minutes using cargobob is a lot faster for further sourcing missions. Headhunter and Sightseer can end in under  each. And theres still enough time in the hour to complete a couple of crate runs having a second wh negates the cooldown penalty. And is combined with MC which takes me  to buy the supplies and basically doubles the cash I put in.Say K profit per car up to kh Kh profit on my  mc buis and the crates which is up to kh but I realistically get kh and I only got time for a couple of crate runs every hour before I attend the IE which means I can only manage two large sales every week. Rounded numbers with K subtracted for minor time wastes and ammunition costs. Yeah its actually closer to kh but it assumes a team of at least  working at high operational efficiency against time. Ive only seen this happening once.Now say you got a team of ppl you and managing a  Top Range car collection sale every  with Headhunter and Sightseer as well as crate missions in between. Now the crew also makes decent cash per hour I think up to Kh for the cars Kh from SeqServ wage Kh from Headhunter and Sightseer so Kh for the crew with the added bonus of up to xK for MC sales when they are ready. If you ask me barely enough cash to make it worth the time of helping but the RP aint bad.Now when I solo all this the operational efficiency plummets and I can only manage kh. Having a heist ready so you can use the message to teleport to the apt and having that apt right across the street from an office makes for a really efficient cycle as it only takes a minute to have another mission ready. And yeah while a couple of days might seem a little short to make all that cash I assure you not only its possible but with the right people it can also be fun. So much fun in fact that those  hours will go by without notice.  Its a lot of shit to take in. So open wide.,gtaonline,dg9xgv2,1,t5_2xrd1

I also hate people that do nothing during the mission and expect to get the payout. I usually play with friends and crew members these days but back on PS I would wait till we were almost finished and kick their asses. I had a guy the other day during the Convoy mission on PacStan stay on the hill and had us fight everybody then a second guy goes meet him no one was on the gun of the insurgent and I was driving the objective truck. I warned him three times to start moving and he wouldnt budge so I put the truck in the water and quit on the restart screen. Fuck that shit. ,gtaonline,dggw2c5,2,t5_2xrd1

Got it and that monster truck and when they arrived I get the Duke out. Holy crap Im in love.I was thrashing around in that thing for a while doing the crate runs and at one point when on my way to a crate pick up I run over a motorbike one of many actually lol. The bike goes under the Duke and the sheer force of how fast I was going blew the fucking bike up under me. I was a bit worried the car would blow but nah.
