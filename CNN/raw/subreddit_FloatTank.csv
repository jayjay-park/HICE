2025216,0,t3_2hur8k,So far everything said is so true. Try not to go in with expectations. And let your mind wander. Thoughts are meant to come and go.The best advice I was given was toWear EarplugsUse VaselineGet comfortable in the tankThen count your breaths to .,FloatTank,ckx8xvj,1,t5_2w32t
3517161,0,t3_30jsew,Also... The comparison of floating versus just meditating I try my best to meditate while I float... in my opinion can be looked at like this... The destination is the same for both of them meditating is like driving a car there floating and meditating is like flying a plane there. ,FloatTank,cpt6kwu,3,t5_2w32t
4126310,0,t1_cpvkgpd,I just had my first float last week and my experience was very similar. The effects in the tank werent very noticeable but afterward I was grabbed my phone waiting for the laundry list of things I needed to do RIGHT NOW and then I put it away almost laughing with amusement thinking who cares? The normal chatter and anxious chest tension had disappeared and didnt return until the next day. Im trying my second tomorrow and really looking forward to it. First time unfortunately I felt too hot and I was sweating on my face and it was quite distracting bringing back some claustrophobic chest tension but I requested to be in one of their cooler tanks so hopefully I can relax even further. I look forward to to the same who cares? Mentality this time. I may go sit in a park or something since last time the idea of going home to TV or my computer felt very forced and unappealing. ,FloatTank,crqmhk3,2,t5_2w32t
4670811,0,t3_3eth4r,My dad and I thought of touring float tanks a few years back to festis etc but decided against it.   We thought that he logistics would be too much along with people trying to clean themselves in themthe showers taking drugs in them and becoming difficult or being too drunk making sure the water is easily and properly filtered plus transporting all the water plus the weight of the Epsom salts could prove tricky due to weight and water movement.   There were a whole bunch of other reasons we decided not too in the end too bit good luck with your endeavour Id be interested to see how it turns out! ,FloatTank,ctjb342,2,t5_2w32t

7126429,0,t1_d1o5gxb,I found your thoughts on this intriguing. First off  my research into DMT has me convinced that humans do posses the ability to communicate telepathically  but just as you said we lack the ability to understand or the software to make sense of it all. The logic you used to reach this conclusion is fascinating. I also found the fact that you used the term software interesting as well considering Dr. John C Lilly constantly refers to the human biocomputer. Im from Boston but Im actually very interested in opening up a float center in this area. Thats super cool you own  operate one. What has been the biggest challenge for you so far?,FloatTank,d1o6yxa,1,t5_2w32t

7288367,0,t1_d26fuz4,That population seems a little bit low. How much is rent there? Is it going to be owner operated? Do you have the capital to cover the startup costs. Tanks  refitting the place and making sure it meets regulations can be a lot of money.PM me if you want more info but I have been to quite a few float centers and talk to the owners on a regular basis.,FloatTank,d26mzpm,1,t5_2w32t

8421674,0,t3_4uqr0b,Put it in my garage.  I dont recommend unless your garage is insulated.Gonna put one inside soon.  And I dont think humidity is a problem as long as your tank is sealed except for the vent for the fan.  One vent hole will not create any noticeable humidity at all.  Leave the room door open for  mins after your float and you wont have an issue.,FloatTank,d5u92fh,1,t5_2w32t
8912037,0,t3_529kxp,Buy a float tank. Put it in your house. Have your friends use it. Sell time to your friends friends. Figure out how to run the business this way and how to differentiate from other float businesses in your area.  Go to another business ask to talk to the owner. Ask himher questions. Go another one. Ask questions. Make friends since youre into the same stuff anyway. After this youll be ready.,FloatTank,d7j3hjd,3,t5_2w32t
