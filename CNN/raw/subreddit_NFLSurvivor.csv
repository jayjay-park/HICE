11461634,0,t1_dfv1lbz,Youre kidding yourself if you think you had a  chance without the alliance.  This is not a random coin fliptype game.  Yes your are correct teams like the Seahawks Packers Patriots etc would be the first to go.  And after they were gone who do you think would be next?  Steelers Ravens Eagles Cowboys and the Football Giants.  Just look ate the baseball survivor game as an example.  Without alliances the teams that win are relatively unsuccessful teams that dont have any rivalries.  Not the teams from the biggest city in the country with two recent championships and rivalries with powerful teams.,NFLSurvivor,dfv63d0,2,t5_3jq1f
