6394970,0,t3_436f7s,I have it on my  as well as the STI short shift.It adds a claimed HP. I have reservations believing that.It does sound good I will admit especially on the decel. I heard both at the dealership and vastly preferred the STI exhaust over stock. It was fuller and deeper.Could you do with the factory STI exhaust? Sure. Could you do with the factory stock exhaust? Sure. I got mine for much less than the  that was quoted so I went with it.As others have said you can do an aftermarket for about the same budget but you genuinely do not need a tune for an aftermarket catback. It wont add or detract much power and the downpipe is still the most restrictive portion of that system maintaining backpressure so the tune will be worthless.Shop around at Invidia Nameless Cobb Perrin etc. Try to hear them in person youtube vids rarely do the exhaust notes justice.,WRX,czgjj1p,1,t5_2vbwe

8622008,0,t3_4xtv1s,Your father doesnt own a CLA with a CVT there is no such thing as a CLA with a CVT. The CLA  has a dual clutch transmission Or DCT and a pretty poor one at that.Kinda seems like you feel like you need to defend your choice to a bunch of strangers. Who cares what others think you do you man. Be careful with tuning though the CVT transmission has shown that it cant handle extra power all too well. I personally wouldnt ever consider an auto WRX. In my mind the WRX is a car designed around the idea of being connected to the road and pretty raw a CVT just takes too much away from that experience. If I want an automatic around the same price as the wrx Id lease an AIC instead. I drove the CVT one before purchasing mine and wasnt all too impressed. But again you do you man.Edit Honestly if I was in your position and wanted what you want Id probably be looking at a GTI or Golf R. AudiVWs DSG is really good. ,WRX,d6jcp17,2,t5_2vbwe

8876820,0,t3_51t5sl,I have the Blizzak WSs they were great both in the mountains and on dry roads in Colorado.As far as TPMS goes you do need to go somewhere to get them paired. I just switch and wait until my next scheduled maintenance to get it paired its usually within a month or so. Its probably more important to have it paired with your winter tires where temp fluctuations will change your pressure. During the summer you should be fairly consistent just keep an eye on the tires and check the pressure manually sometimes.As far as Rims go I found a set of  base wheels that someone upgraded from and they were dumping for cheap. Theyre  vs  for my summers but its better to go smaller with winter tires so you have more rubber.,WRX,d7eva47,2,t5_2vbwe

8904433,0,t1_d7hp4e9,For me the first gear constantly felt like it was being braked which is what my coworker felt as well. It could be that our roads are really uneven and hill assist constantly kicked in at appropriate times. Before I couldnt drive in first gear because it would start slowing down and feeling like I shouldnt be in first gear at all. I attributed this to rev hang but it went away I think some people may be attributing this to rev hang as well but its just the bad hill assist system.

All thats done is make the foglights useless for their intended purpose and notable reduce your night visibility in clear weather running those.  Foglights are supposed to be lower light emission and they arent supposed to be on in clear weather at all.You should also remove that HID kit unless youre installing a TRS or Prolightz retrofit kit.

9656324,0,t1_da37g6q,Like I said I was just going off from what I have read when I first started looking at modifications to the FA. It seemed like I was reading a lot on how this engine is already putting out roughly max power and there wasnt much room to spare. But then I would read about people with custom tunes doing over HP at the wheels. Of course this isnt likely with stock components like intake exhaust and such. If they can do it and as you pointed out have done it then why did they stick with the EJ in the STI? There has to be a reason. It might be that they cant pass emissions in the US or other areas when putting that much power out of a FA engine. Though one article I saw in a quick search made it seem like it was pretty clean in terms of emissions and they added the auto startstop feature to reduce emissions at traffic lights. Is the Legacy GT DIT available in the US? I think it is Japan only but maybe wrong on that. It will be interesting to see what happens.,WRX,da3cd7w,1,t5_2vbwe

Its a little loud on cold start but once its in idle and normal driving its perfect. Its aggressive when you are but quiet and little to no drone during regular driving. I chose it over the nameless axleback because of the videos I watched on youtube and I have to say while the videos do give it a nice sound they do it no justice compared to in person. Its a little pricey but with the limited drone great look and great sound I definitely recommend it over the nameless axleback!Edit also want to point out how fast shipping was with the ets they make everything to order so they dont have them in stock.

10934379,0,t1_de7lrm0,I didnt hear it anywhere.Rev to k dump the clutch with minimum slip in an AWD car and a WD car. In any WD car with as much power as the WRX the wheels will spin for a moment and then you start going. In the AWD car everything goes clunkbash as the center diff slams into your floorpan and then you either lurch forward with a lugging engine or stall the engine completely. To launch AWD in that same situation requires that you slip the clutch momentarily to break static resistance before you can lock up the drivetrain. The only exceptions to this are vehicles with so much AW torque that they can burn out all tiresnot the WRX.A similar effect occurs as you shift from st to nd due to the torque ratio for both of those gears. So in a WD car geared like the WRX with a bad shift or bad rev matching youd just get a tiny amount of wheelspin to soak up the energy. In the AWD again you smash your center diff into the floorpan and lurch. You really have to catch the Subaru at the right place in the torque band.In my experience  of people who learned to drive stick on a WD car have trouble transitioning to the AWD vehicle. It takes them a while to get used to slipping the clutch just enough when they start the car moving and to catch the shift from  to .,WRX,de7sywd,0,t5_2vbwe
10946761,0,t1_de92vth,yeah i just do not know anyone near my location WV. i would more than likely need to get an ETUNE,WRX,de92xcr,1,t5_2vbwe
10961696,0,t1_deaka4w,Yeah im not worried about the payment. Im nervous about having my first manual but it should be a fun three years getting used to it!,WRX,deamdpf,2,t5_2vbwe
10977674,0,t1_decacfp,Thanks for the advice mate Ill be sure to do my research. Its not a big ass dent but it looks bad right in a pristine piece of WRB sheet metal  And since its on the drivers side Ill see it every day. ,WRX,decaom2,1,t5_2vbwe

11148011,0,t3_5z651h,Ha I agree with you that its annoying. Although I doubt there is a way to disable it easily. Its funny that the smallest amount of throttle makes you go from  MPG to  MPG instantly.,WRX,devm5lm,3,t5_2vbwe
11169433,0,t1_dey110z,I know nothing about fixing this kind of stuff... Will they give me the paint and I can fix it or have my car fix it? Do I need to buy a separate top coat? Thanks so much for your help! ,WRX,dey1kpl,1,t5_2vbwe

11261169,0,t3_60q8f5,For me it was the WRX GTI or the ST. Now Im a Ford fan and I think the ST is an immensely fun car to drive and the Best bang for the buck. The GTI was the nicest most refined and comfortable of the group.The WRX though out performs the other two in every category and its all wheel drive. In the end I picked up a base WRX.,WRX,df8fqix,13,t5_2vbwe

11576338,0,t3_658427,It was an  wrx. Owned it for about a year. Totaled it about last month  I loved this car and it really sucks that it had to happen to a car like this. Hope no one gets as unlucky as I did More pics ,WRX,dg86mvy,11,t5_2vbwe
11641547,0,t3_6647qz,Go rent a manual transmission car for like  bucks for a day or however much it is where your at make sure to get insurance. Drive THAT car around for a day . By the end of the day you have no worries messing up your STI clutch! Congrats as well! ,WRX,dgfkzt4,2,t5_2vbwe

11678402,0,t3_66e2xk,Best tool Ive bought in a while is a cordless impact gun.  Mine is Dewalt but Makita is good too.  Dont use it to tighten down just break stuff loose.  Maybe not a necessity but really nice to have especially as I get older.  A good breaker bar wrench is good too. Dont use your torque wrench as a breaker bar.  Also buy a torque wrench.   Tektron is ok.  Amazon carries them.  I bought one to replace my old Craftsman torque wrench that crapped out on me.  ,WRX,dgjrhtq,2,t5_2vbwe

11760643,0,t3_67t833,Theres a clip inside thats supposed to hold it in the rest of the housing but if it becomes undone it will be a little loose going forward. I knocked mine out by accidentally screwing the shift knob on too far. If it manages to sit in there flushsnaps in with force I would put a little dab of glue on both sides underneath and let it dry. No sense losing your car for a day or two if the dealer is going to do the same exact thing.,WRX,dgt3k3j,2,t5_2vbwe
