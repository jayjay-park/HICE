6639129,0,t3_46lbrh,It gets better. Ive finished the season and I think the early episodes were the weakest. Overall I thought it was ok. I kept watching cause I think Gillian Jacobs is great. ,LoveTV,d061kh6,9,t5_35afl
6641937,0,t1_d061kv6,Yep thats Mike Mitchell who is a member of the sketch comedy group The Birthday Boys. ,LoveTV,d06c106,29,t5_35afl

6647774,0,t3_46jmyt,I really like the direction they went with the child actress. They really gave her depth and made her far more real than a lesser show wouldve and I thought she did well performing her breakdown. ,LoveTV,d06xrhs,33,t5_35afl
6648799,0,t1_d06whdp,Shes grown up so much!,LoveTV,d071km5,6,t5_35afl
6655374,0,t1_d07kby6,Dude Im also a dude. Oh yeah Gus isnt hostile. Thats why Gus thinks he is a nice guy. But everything he does is on purpose. Like look in the last episode. Gus knew how much the child actress liked him and its why he went to her bitching about being fired. He knew she would pitch a bitch just to get him rehired. Seriously what kind of adult goes crying to a  year old that they got fired. Its why the tall guy called Gus a cunt because he manipulated her to get what he wanted. And thats what Gus does hes a huge manipulator. Maybe Im reading to far into it and seeing a conspiracy thats not there. But to me Gus is nothing but a facade. Just look at the character. Everyone here is acting like Gus is some shy quiet nerd who just means well but that is not represented in the show at all. He has a fantastic job. And an amazing apartment. He has a ton of friends that like and respect him. And the dude is damn near swimming in pussy. And you have to stop and ask yourself how? Like how does he have all of that. Hes fucking awful at his job. Like fucking terrible. Like how does he still have a job. Because all those scenes where we say the child actress walking all over Gus to us we thought we were seeing some poor schmuck getting taken advantage of but in reality he was grooming her. He was teaching her to associate him with a good time and the only fun she ever really has is with him. We see even more manipulation when he cheats the test to try and get the show producer to read his script but she called him on his shit. The whole crew hates him because they know who he really is. Its why he has the break down in the writers room because all of his tricks dont work on them because they deal with that shit all the time. That huge fight he had with Mickey in front of everyone? He did that on purpose. He did that to make the blonde actress like him more and he did it to make himself appear cooler and interesting than he actually was in front of everyone. But what did the producer say to him afterwards. This is not your own version of the bachelor. Shes right there calling him out on the show he just put on.  He comes off as the shy nerd but hes incredibly outgoing when he wants to be the center of attention. Like for a guy who acts like he never knows the right thing to say he sure can be the life of the party when he wants to be. He goes to a party where he knows no one and before you know it hes the lead singer in a new band and has an incredibly hot woman all over his dick. Come on son. Listen to everything his ex girlfriend says at the beginning of the show. About how he is fake nice. How even though she said she wanted out of the relationship he would turn it around so she wouldnt leave. You really think he accidentally gave mickey the wrong address? No he did that shit on purpose. Remember when he told his friends he was waiting for his ex to call him wanting him back? She was going to. Because he laid down the ground work for her to want him back even though she didnt really love him. Heres my final point in this tyrade because ive been up for over  hours and I think Im going nuts but this is why I love this show. Weve been conditioned our whole lives to see guys like Gus as the hero in movies and tv shows. The shy lovable Nice Guy who means well but oh gosh darn Im just so nice! But Apatow took that trope and wonderfully deconstructed it. He took the old Nice Guy and Rebel Girl tropes and showed who they really were. Lets take a look at the very last scene. Gus has lost everything. All the hard work he put in was dashed against the rocks. And Mickey runs up to him and lets it all out and exposes her vulnerabilities to him. And what does he do? He exploits them. Without hesitation he takes her biggest weakness and turns it against her. Thats what Nice Guys do. They manipulate women into liking them. ,LoveTV,d07q1wq,57,t5_35afl

Not doubting you or anything just kind of surprised that I guess people can set themselves up in multiple dates on the same weekend with different people.

6693106,0,t1_d09jhlu,I totally agree. I think that Gus and Mickey are falling more into codependency than love. Mickey uses sex as a coping tool and as leverage. Its like she doesnt even believe she is valuable to others if shes not fucking them. And shes losing hope that shes even lovable at all.I cant figure out Gus as well yet but he has some difficulty with reality I think. Its not so much that hes fake nice to others. Its more like he sees the world through romantic eyes as a way of avoiding harsh truths.Mickey straightup confesses that she shouldnt be with anyone and Gus just ignores that and kisses her. The fantasy that theyre falling hard in love is so much better than reality. He just believes in magic because its easier. Mickey struggles to believe in anything at all so shes hooked on Gus as someone who can give her some hope again.But theyre both basically using the other as a crutch. I dont think theyll end up together. They probably shouldnt.,LoveTV,d0bmjai,19,t5_35afl
6714784,0,t1_d0aced8,From what his ex said in episode  he might have been a dick all along. We just took a while to fully realize it and just how right she was. ,LoveTV,d0dv77h,8,t5_35afl
6717454,0,t1_d0e2o01,Imo part of the redeeming quality with Mickey as opposed to Gus is that Mickey knows shes fucked up and shes trying to better herself. Gus still thinks hes the nice guy and everyone else is the problem and it turns out he actually is fake nice while not actually being nicedoing things for unselfish reasons. Both Mickey and Gus are flawed people but at least Mickey was or tried to be open about how she felt while Gus generally didnt speak his thoughts or how he felt and eventually ignored her probably hoping she would give up and he wouldnt have to actually break up with her or at least tell her he wasnt interested in pursuing a relationship with her especially before hooking up with someone else.,LoveTV,d0e55jw,15,t5_35afl
6746217,0,t1_d0f8nzn,shes gotten away with saying shitty things to him so she probably expected it to be okay again. she saiddid some things at the magic castle to embarrass him yet in the end he decides to stay over. she does the same here then panics when she realizes that she fucked up through the lack of texts.,LoveTV,d0h463y,5,t5_35afl

11121738,0,t1_desmk6d,Mickey betraying Gus and seeing her ex is maybe partly due to her sex amp love addiction in my opinion. But if you are not convinced with it and just say fuck Mickey then maybe the show should try more of how Mickey tries hard to deal with sex and love addiction.,LoveTV,desn1r5,10,t5_35afl

11135093,0,t1_descgqk,I dont think her being more serious with Gus will help in any way. She is jumping from one addiction to the next and until she figures out how to face life without drugs alcohol sex or love what Gus represents then she will never heal and will always be depending on something. She needs to stop dating altogether because even if Gus were the perfect guy she would fuck things up. She is a self sabotaging trainwreck. And fyi im in no way implying Gus is flawless he is fucked up in his own way too. ,LoveTV,deu5hcg,10,t5_35afl
11151658,0,t1_deqzefk,As somebody that was in Amsterdam on shrooms this weekend it happens. Of the six friends I tripped with one had a real bad time and just started going on about how much of a fuckup he was and how everyone was just pretending to put up with him. In Randys case it seems like he just got fixated on his own anxiety about not having a job a home or a direction in his life and had a bad trip as a result. The barbarian thing feels tangential to that feeling that Randy isnt doing what hes supposed to do.,LoveTV,dew115k,4,t5_35afl

11155666,0,t3_5yl2m0,This was a great concept for a bottle episode and it was executed superbly.  ,LoveTV,dewhec5,3,t5_35afl
11167918,0,t1_desa57c,gt ...but she picked up an arguably even worse habit which is smoking.Addiction to nicotine is no where near as damaging psychologically and emotionally speaking than drug alcohol or sex addiction is. Nobody ruins their life from smoking cigarettes. You cant hit rock bottom from smoking cigarettes. You might get cancer but thats a longterm health issue and is completely different than the kinds of issues that arise from being addicted to alcohol drugs sex gambling etc.Also she didnt pick it up this season shes been smoking regularly since season .While I dont think that Mickey was right to cheat I do consider it cheating on Gus I dont think that its necessarily the best approach to tell him. All that will do is destroy his confidence break his heart and ruin what could potentially become a good relationship. ,LoveTV,dexve7f,1,t5_35afl

11182902,0,t1_dewoy4x,Yup that shit kinda hurt to watch. When my ex and I had our first break she went right to the guy that had been pursuing her for the entirety of the beginning of our relationship. Every time I told her I was uncomfortable with him I would get the hes just a friend. I forgave her when she told me as were getting back together because people deserve a second chance but boy do I wish I wouldve just moved on then and there.My main point is that its hard for me to not be biased with Gus even though he has fucked up plenty albeit in smaller ways.,LoveTV,dezki08,6,t5_35afl
