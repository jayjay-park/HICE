5300920,0,t3_3nko8o,Hey! Im curious about this too! I use the Chopra Center however they have more spiritual style guided meditations that go back to things in Yoga. It might be best if you do a trial and error run and go through Youtube videos of guided meditations. Ive come across several that were more secular than spiritual although i cant remember the names or videos as this was a while ago. Sorry i cant help more hopefully someone can. ,audiomeditation,cvp95gg,2,t5_2zz1k
