10765285,0,t1_ddpqa28,Thank you having a response with a clear answer helps me process this.Have any advice on how to approach him about his behavior while drunk? I can try to accept his sexuality but cannot accept his sexual advances on men while in a committed relationship with me. I have told him I am uncomfortable with his comments but he insists they mean nothing and that I am overreacting. ,sexuality,ddqcxzi,1,t5_2rgls
