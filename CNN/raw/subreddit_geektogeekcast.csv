9078867,0,t1_d8323lh,After our episode I basically havent touched No Mans Sky at all.  Once I saw the edges of what were possible I got really disheartened with the game.But EVE still holds a certain allure.  I know eventually Ill go back and give it another shot.,geektogeekcast,d834s1a,2,t5_3exqi
9136125,0,t1_d84mc4n,OMG BSG. It is a show to watch from the beginning. If you havent seen it its probably my highest recommended show to someone who hasnt seen it over anything else.,geektogeekcast,d8a2jex,4,t5_3exqi

9943358,0,t3_5hecig,Woo! Great episode! Im biased of course Final Fantasy anything is my jam.I was pretty stoked to hear about Beej getting a Roomba though ironically I just listened to a podcast last week that featured a guest who worked on the design features of Roomba. She ran a focus group and found that giving the robot more emotive functions such as making different sounds for various tasks helped people become more attached to their robots and view them fondly so when Beej said he named it I wasnt too surprised. Btw Pig is a great name choice.As for the Final Fantasy segment I agree with a lot of points Void brought up and Ambitious mess might be the best way Ive heard the game described so far. For all of its flaws it definitely punched the emotional buttons just right. Loved it though and will definitely keep up with the DLCpatchesextra content that Square Enix drops. Have a good week! ,geektogeekcast,db3n6nm,2,t5_3exqi
9946909,0,t1_db3n6nm,Im really interested to see if they can clean up some of the mess part with free DLCs and content patches.  It sounds like theyre going to try.,geektogeekcast,db43vrg,1,t5_3exqi
10060701,0,t3_5jshrp,Ok I picked up Stellaris Analogue A Hate Story Abzu OrwellBasically I sorted my wishlist by ascending price and then picked a few.  Also... Stellaris... since Ive almost bought that game like  times even though it wasnt super cheap.,geektogeekcast,dbixmeg,2,t5_3exqi
10274761,0,t1_dc6p54x,I know this happened since we were talking on Twitter  but you never actually told me what you thought of the series as a whole! So... thoughts?,geektogeekcast,dc8p7d3,2,t5_3exqi
11068452,0,t1_deluoyd,Im kinda between you guys  it was pitchperfect for what it was setting out to be which is the best way to really nail these comic book movies that are so reliant on their characters. Minireview time?For a relatively small story I agree that it had too many characters  moving parts I found Rice being responsible for mutants dying out to be a bit too much lookit how evil this guy is and as fun as it is to have a mirror match I agree that we didnt need X when we had two other perfectly good villains already. In fact I think the other two fit better thematically  the Reavers nonmutant status and cybernetics fit with the idea of Logansmutants time being over and your notion of using trigger scent instead would give narrative teeth to the otherwiseglossedover killing missions and have obvious emotional strings to pull on.Kind of agree with Liam on the Caliban thing he was necessary as Xaviers primary caregiver but that part could have been filled by any other mutant and killing him off at the end of the first act could have made the Reavers into more of a threat as they are theyre kind of portrayed as dumb muscle. He wasnt really necessary throughout the second act. Neither was the liquefied healing factor that the new mutants conveniently had again in a few ways this movie could have gone even smaller and been the better for it.That said its the only superhero movie to make my cry so its riding really high on that alone. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are always a treat this is the best fit for what theyve been trying to portray with their Wolverine for over  years now and the emotional and physical conflicts in this movie felt far betterintegrated than we tend to get out of comic book adaptations a good ones being the first Iron Man all the Marvel Netflix series and Bats v Supes for all its other problems. Even the finality of Logans death this would make a great end to the XMen movie series as a whole really and the lack of explicit flashbacks instead referring offhand to the Statue of Liberty and doing Lauras backstory via a video diary fit with the overall flavor  all the great bits stem from the fact that the core direction was so strong and present throughout.Its pretty easy to place this as the single best XMen movie theyve ever put out and I think it stands qualitywise next to the best of the MCU material. Supergreat film I plan on seeing it again either on bluray or at a cheap theater which I havent felt the pull to do for any of the other XMen series.,geektogeekcast,demlk4g,2,t5_3exqi
11245452,0,t1_df6f3ef,The incentive structure in Zelda is totally different than Skyrim and I think its all the better for it.  I would love to hear what you think of this game.,geektogeekcast,df6nliy,3,t5_3exqi
