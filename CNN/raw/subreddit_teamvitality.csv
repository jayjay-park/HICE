10229681,0,t3_5mfkb5,Really surprised that GBM was willing to join in a substitute role. I understand hell still be competing for the main spot but with his level of experience albeit not in the jungle I expected hed only be interested in a guaranteed spot.This is a massive improvement from last season where the jungle position for Vitality was a glaring weakness with no simple solutions being available to fix it mid split due to the lack of free agents and no strong substitute.,teamvitality,dc3laz0,2,t5_3bd9q
