2207466,0,t3_2kb8x5, I think the first idea is bad because sometimes we get much stronger opponents and we would waste attacks on stronger opponents. If we had had this rule I would have had to attack TH or TH bases with my TH army the last few wars. In these cases our only hope is that the enemy is either really dumb and cant star our top bases or that they are inactive. Your reasoning with luck is not that good either. War shouldnt depend on luck and why would we let our  and  get  star each on their counterparts if our  could get a star on the enemy . Second one is a good idea and I dont know why we dont have this rule. Third idea is also reasonable but I dont think its necessary. Fourth idea is bad because I usually spend k elixir on an attack. Why would I waste elixir on a second attack if we have no mathematical chances at winning? eg. last war we had our top  all starred while we couldnt even touch their top .,CoCRedditSigma,clkf8df,1,t5_31t87

3410605,0,t1_cph0ebx,I know that we are low on members and as soon as I can get the leadership fixed up I will be working on that. At the same time I would personally prefer a small amount of activeloyal members over a larger amount of members if they will be gone in a week or so.,CoCRedditSigma,cph18n0,1,t5_31t87
3462581,0,t1_cpmsws8,The only reason I dont claim a base sometimes is because I need longer time to decide which base to attack and how to attack it.  And I also got lazy but I do check the thread to make sure I dont take someone elses base. ,CoCRedditSigma,cpmyjic,1,t5_31t87
