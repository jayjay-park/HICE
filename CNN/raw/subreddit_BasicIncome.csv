552885,0,t3_20gvcg,.  Technological development particularly automation has reached a point at which the needs perhaps not all the wants but definitely the needs of a population can be provided for by a tiny percentage of the population.For example From the wikipedia article on Agriculture in the US based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data In   percent of the US population was employed in agriculture. As of  less than  percent of the population is directly employed in agriculture.  So if even only  of the population naturally has an interest from curiosity or a sense of responsibility or an interest in agrarian living and cultivating food or even masochism who knows in operating agricultural equipment for some reason our food needs will be met.  And if not enough people would naturally want to do these jobs without additional compensation above the basic income If people can better choose whether to be employed in any particular position without the threat of financial ruin looming over them should they quit the least desirable boring dangerous tiring etc. jobs will be compensated better or be improved with better working conditions until they do become desirable enough to potential employees to be worth taking.  If undesirable jobs are compensated better it will make their labor costs higher from an employers perspective than they are today.  This in turn will cause there to be greater incentive to more completely automate these positions leading to a more complete elimination of their employment requirements fewer and fewer people will be required to do them.  Also. Basic Income does not eliminate or forbid paid positions i.e. employment the exchange of labor for capital or commerce itself.  While some people always have been and always will be driven to be productive from their curiosity desire to feel useful egotism desire for social recognition or other reasons some people will continue to be driven by greed.  If a person wants to have disposable income above their basic income they will still be fiscally motivated to work for that.  Suppose the basic income was k.  If you make more than that and are accustomed to the life style your paycheck affords you above that bare minimum k level of subsistence youd have reason to continue working.  ,BasicIncome,cg34bku,2,t5_2v1jk

679121,0,t1_cghacxs,I doesnt seem to have been too popular but heres what I took from the article that I do think makes it important.. There exists a study that shows reducing taxes does not stimulate the economy but stuff like food stamps unemployment insurance and TANF do.. Its the redistribution part that provides the greatest stimulus.. The link to the actual study. From the studys conclusiongtWe found that lowering taxes on sales property and corporate and personal income or reducing the progressivity of the personal income tax did not have a significant impact on the volatility of the business cycle. Moreover lowering these taxes raised average output and improved several measures of welfare. At the same time higher transfers to the unemployed and poor were quite effective at lowering volatility with negligible effects on averages. This suggests that expanding the safety net might lead to a more stable economy. In terms of the channels of stabilization we found that the traditional disposable income channel used to support automatic stabilizers is quantitatively weak. Considerably more important was the role of precautionary savings and social insurance. Policies that redistribute from the richer who have lower MPCs and respond more strongly to cuts in wages lower the amplitude of the business cycle and especially the crosssectional dispersion of household consumption.If you look at those points and dont see how it provides evidence for basic income I would suggest looking again.,BasicIncome,cghgt31,1,t5_2v1jk

SocialismMarxismis to be very simple Tax  doGovernment Distribute remainder equallyUBI is essentially this but with a tax below .  My proposal follows FDRs Social Security strategy and creates a separate dedicated UBI tax so that we know its a part of income not the leftovers of Government.  You cant fund Government from UBI tax.  And youre right  Fixed tax percent flat.  I outlined why this is good in my proposal which needs refinement.  Ill start campaigning soon.Hes also right that a very high UBI will make people not want to work.  Hell I get a lot of flexibility because Im a financial genius.  I make kyear and I only need ish to get by with UBI I could easily get out of working.  I own a house mortgage  year old will pay it off soon.None of this is windfall from investments much of it is willingness to live in the shithole ghetto which if you gentrify the shit out of it by moving the middle class there will no longer be a cheap way to escape and live on UBI.Most notably though our proposed UBI isnt very high.  Its nearly but just below living expenses.  It encourages the creation of inexpensive housing but there is no way in hell your landlord is going to give you luxury housing.  Youre going to live in a shithole.  Youre going to want out of it.  And youre going to want to buy things but you cant afford nice things at all because you have no damn money because it all goes to getting by.If we jack up the UBI from  to some  tax hell yes.  Im getting kyear for sitting on my ass?  Hell.  Yes.  Im retiring.  So dont do that.  Keep that shit low low enough that I want to work low enough so I dont want to be unemployed.  Itll help if Im unemployeditll protect my savings itll help me keep my standard of living for longer itll help me get by if I fail out really hardbut Id rather avoid that because I love having nice things that poor people cant have because theyre poor.Poor people want those nice things too.  They can either try to steal them from me or they can get jobs.  Trying to steal them from me has hazards and is a bunch of work getting jobs is a bunch of work too.  But with UBI getting jobs doesnt risk losing your welfare so its less risk which means more poor people will probably aim for jobs and not commit crimes and those who are not going to get a job yet or who cant find employment have less of a reason to try to steal my shit.See?  UBI both encourages employment and reduces crime all while reducing the impacts of poverty.

I am not interested in imposing my world view on others so until we get the point where we actually have the space to create solutions to the problems we face I have very little personal interest in sharing what my own views on the matter are.Moreover I reject the demand of immediacy you have by suggesting any revolutionary movement should from the start have everything figured out but this is nonsense. Not even the state institutions you take for granted have any real longterm endgame goal. There is no future we have all agreed upon simply an ever increasing likelihood of outcomes which were shaped by decisions of only a few people.I believe that there are many many complex issues to face as we go forward and the only way those issues can be dealt with without simply glossing them over is to have long inclusive discussions about them as we move forward in other areas we feel confident in.Ultimately the problem here though is your equivocation of revolution with revolutionary violence. A revolution is simply a shift in what is taken for granted as common sense in the sphere of politics it does not require bombs or bullets or destruction. In fact most people who explicitly call for revolution that I know are calling for the creation of workercommunes peer cooperatives and General Assemblies... things which create and contribute not destroy and maim.EDIT From the article I linkedgtNormally when you challenge the conventional wisdomthat the current economic and political system is the only possible onethe first reaction you are likely to get is a demand for a detailed architectural blueprint of how an alternative system would work down to the nature of its financial instruments energy supplies and policies of sewer maintenance. Next you are likely to be asked for a detailed program of how this system will be brought into existence. Historically this is ridiculous. When has social change ever happened according to someones blueprint? Its not as if a small circle of visionaries in Renaissance Florence conceived of something they called capitalism figured out the details of how the stock exchange and factories would someday work and then put in place a program to bring their visions into reality. In fact the idea is so absurd we might well ask ourselves how it ever occurred to us to imagine this is how change happens to begin.gtgtThis is not to say theres anything wrong with utopian visions. Or even blueprints. They just need to be kept in their place. The theorist Michael Albert has worked out a detailed plan for how a modern economy could run without money on a democratic participatory basis. I think this is an important achievementnot because I think that exact model could ever be instituted in exactly the form in which he describes it but because it makes it impossible to say that such a thing is inconceivable. Still such models can be only thought experiments. We cannot really conceive of the problems that will arise when we start trying to build a free society.

New cars and larger apartments wouldnt be dreams anymore theyd be realities within their grasp. People would work because they could get a higher style of living for themselves and their family. You might be surprised but people like luxuries and most people arent content with just their basic means being met. Relative costs would go down across the board because suddenly theres an entirely new market of people wanting to buy those things.,BasicIncome,chrwfrj,1,t5_2v1jk
1095158,0,t1_chsr2ak,My issue is there are better taxes IMO. I dont agree with the concept that people should have to pay for what they legally own in perpetuity. I dont agree people who dont have much money but have land should be taxed. I think georgism is a philosophy that makes sense in a th century agrarian society but is very divorced of st century economic realities of widespread home ownership and welath being created irrespective of direct land use. Ill only settle for LVT if it turns out collecting taxes other ways turns out to be more economically devastating or unviable. Until then I see LVT as poorly targetted and unjust. Its a last resort tax to me when all others fail.Honestly I see the arguments for LVT outside of the fact that its impossible to avoid to be highly ideological and its an ideology I simply dont agree with. I dont buy into this no one has a right to the land it belongs to everyone stuff. If I pay a freaking mortgage for decades on something it better darn well be mine. Im very uncomfortable with the idea of people siezing something i legally paid for after the fact because I dont pay a hostage tax every year. Thats literally extortion. You need to understand this. This is very important. WHen you step outside of the philosophical construct that is georgism LVT goes from being perfectly fair to literally being a form of extortion. The value argument made by the LVT can be countered with my own value argument. Morality is largely subjective after all and what is a concern in one moral philosophy is an irrelevant tangental issue in another. And land ownership is a lot like that in my philosophy. Its simply not something I give a crap about. I believe people are entitled to what they paid for and trying to impose your philosophy on the matter creates a problem in mine. And considering how these counter values also play a part in my goals in establishing UBI in particular I see LVT as being counterproductive. Ill agree hoarding is a problem but most land owners are not hoarders.So yes to me it is a nonstarter. I think my concerns stand when I see better options on the table. To be clear once again I would not be opposed to a corporate land tax if implementation could not be avoided where actual goods are being produced and people have the ability to pay. I also do not have a problem with a form of an estate tax where people who own significant tracts of land far above one persons fair share would have to pay a tax so that they cannot hoard or monopolize it. But these are vastly different than trying to fund a multi trillion dollar UBI on this form of taxation. ,BasicIncome,chsruzz,1,t5_2v1jk

In order to be able to say the free market is capable of fairly distributing money to the benefit of society you either have to believe that all workers have an unlimited capacity to be educated or you have to believe that businesses hiring the most desperate workers for the least amount of money are acting in the best interests of society as a whole.

1678834,0,t3_2dkq8k,Ive been trying to come up with a revenue stream to finance something like this. My mind has been circling around technologies I know such as  google ads affiliate marketing and websites. We produce a lot of content here and people interested in the idea are published all over the place. That content is generating page views presumably ad clicks perhaps purchases and that means revenue for the publishers and platforms where the content resides.How much revenue? Very difficult to say but wouldnt it nice if the generated revenue was going into financing Basic incomes? Im still mulling the idea over but perhaps something along the lines of a social network publishing shopping and application platform that pools generated revenue with minimal operating expense which distributes the balance as basic income to as many people as possible. Ideally a limited number of domains so people could clear ad blocks easily in support. Though click fraud worries me a bit with general ads. Less so with affiliate ads that require a purchase but sign up adverts I think would be out. Not sure if such a setup would qualify as a rewards site or not. People receiving the basic income would have an incentive to continue buying through the network referrals which cycles some of the revenue back into the project. Perhaps even ETSY like stores for network members with zero fees. May even be able to integrate a BI crytocurrency into the network where recipients can purchase productsnew or used and services from network members.

1691089,0,t3_2drg7w,It depends on your age and if a majority of people would be in need of a basic income and a majority vote would be needed to make it happen.  I do believe that with automation a basic income could be a possibility but also that new jobs would arise that may replace those lost is another possibility.  If you want to want to look at it from a literal perspective poverty has always been present  some acknowledge it but its my belief that most choose to look the other way.  I do not believe that poverty in our nation is a resource issue but a psychological one.  People choose to not feed or cloth others as people have a lack of empathy.  I do not think america will change on this unless a majority of Americans are personally impoverished as people simply cant put themselves in other peoples shoes.  As you pointed out people believe that poor people have earned their place in society.  To get  million people to understand anothers financial situation would be on par with getting them to understand and accept each others religion.  I do believe that smaller countries with more difficult financial situations would be more likely to implement UBI as their citizens would have more need. Unfortunately those same countries would have a smaller tax basis or GDP so their government couldnt afford it. ,BasicIncome,cjsbqm3,8,t5_2v1jk

If they bailed out the banks and set EXTREME regulation and taxes to keep it from happening again it would have had the same effect  telling the suits to stop fucking with our economy for their own personal gain and settling the wealth gap. Instead they did the worst thing imaginable by bailing out the banks and the people responsible and sending them on their way scotfree.

I still favor emphasizing wealthincome over land.My mining company is owned by an umbrella corporation based in Luxenbourg it owns a daughter company in the DRC. The umbrella company renders various goods and services to the daughter company in addition to capital loans. Weirdly enough the interest of the loans and the price for the goods and services cost so much that the daughter company either has  profits or a loss every year.When the mine is dry the daughter company stops paying the workers taxes and bills. Then it declares bankruptcy. You can imagine the effect on the local economy when a sizeable portion of the workers and local companies isnt paid. IBM in Norway uses this strategy Amazon uses it in the EU and so on they dont do the bankruptcy thing because they they dont run out of profits.gtOk well you see what youre talking about is actually foreign in the US.

This holds true across the spectrum be it economic or environmental concerns workers compensation or work environment and safety.One fallacy we seem to fall into is the all or nothing system when I am really just seeking to promote balance by tipping favor a bit towards the worker in a system that is too far skewed towards the owner.In Germany they have what is called codetermination which by law gives workers represented in the board of companies.  This creates a balance between decisions made by the executives who are essentially mediating a situation that pits shareholders profit incentive against workers through fair compensation or even reinvestment in the company for stability over risky profit seeking.Why would a handful of plutocrat jetsetters care what happens to a factory in Ruraltown Idaho?  No matter how short sighted they will pick short gains every time partly due to the trend of tying executive compensation to stock that started in the s and s.gtThe reason low skill workers have no leverage is because there is more supply than demand. What does this mean?  The workers are continuing to acquire more education more skills more efficiency.  The problem is that there is not enough market for human capital  as in their time is not being valued.  Any person that gives up life to be subservient to another deserves to be compensated fairly even if relative to the labor market at large they ar enot special.So what we have here is not low skill workers the problem is that every one is skilled so relative to each other it becomes harder and harder to stand out.  Of course I am not speaking to niche specializations but as others mention the obvious not everyone can be doctors not everyone can be developers.gtWont this just enable people to work for even less? This doesnt eliminate the fact that there are millions of people competing for the jobs. It softens the blow of being taken out of the labor market.  Actually no it destroys the labor market as we know it.  There is really no saying what would happen but people are clever and I would expect microjobs to become more of a thing where people are willing to pay a bit for someone to do a task that takes time and is inconvenient.  Hell much of our first world economy today the part not built on needless and mindless consumption is built on convenience.It seems presumptuous to say people wouldnt work or couldnt find work.  It is also a fallacy to claim work doesnt need to be done.  Today there is very mcuh work that needs to be done.  Streets that need to be cleaned schools to pait extra the problem is not lack of work it is that the work exists without a profit motive so in the system of capitalism no resources will be allocated to the tasks regardless if the community as a whole would stand to benefit in ways that cannot be measured in dollars.It makes much more sense to think that a community given resources money will invest in ways to satisify its needs that will generate economic activity jobs.  These communities are currently underserved in a system that concentrates wealth too far towards the elite.Only in this kind of backwards capitalist mentality do they both desire full employment consumption but real work is left undone while factories and machines idle becaues the corporations have not found a way to profit from the transaction.,BasicIncome,ckyptg2,1,t5_2v1jk

Will everyone feel they can quit their job? No. But will more people feel this way than they do right now? Yes. Will all wages go up? No. Will some go up and some go down? Yes. Will more go up than they go down? Unknown but I think its safe to say its likely based on the previous point. Will everyone be able to move from their current city to another city? No. Will more people be able to move than are able to right now? Yes. Will everyone without or even with a job create their own jobs? No. Will more people create their own jobs than do right now? This seems likely given the data from BIG experiments. Will more people look for work once a BIG replaces the income ceilings imposed by programs like disability and welfare? This seems likely. That is what we want isnt it? If the concern is that this will lower wages this still needs to be combined with the possible decrease in hours worked students deciding to focus on school parents focused on parenting and the ability for everyone to negotiate higher wages through a heightened negotiating level than currently exists outside of union membership.What we need to keep in mind is that a system already exists and that a basic income adjusts this system to produce better results than we have now.

But unless I could start a new planet all of these options are going to be around for a while.

2596652,0,t3_2pj0k5,On welfare the fatal flaw in the welfare system is that once you begin making money from other sources you lose the welfare. This turns any attempt at productivity into a significant risk and makes the welfare system a trap that people fall into and cant get out of. The strength of the UBI is that it isnt removed once you make money from other sources. This makes people far more likely to take risks and attempt to be productive. There is no need to give them more money to achieve this just dont take their primary survival tool away. On raising the basic income amount if we are to be realistic the basic income likely wont suddenly shoot up to k in a day.

I heard this was made to put pressure on the wages. Gerhard Schroeder for example pointed out recently that that was explicit goal of the harsher welfare rules in Germany. he must know since he was head of state when introducedgt The extra incentive of basic income would attract many more people to claim it which would decrease the workforceTheres plenty of studies that disprove that. Also what makes you think the workforce has the means to finance the state to begin with? We live in an increasingly unequal world the workers are running out of money to finance the state at this rate... So we need to think over who and how to taxa good bit anyway.gt The social welfare system offers free courses training and education Not in Germany. The offer makework and dead end plans for life.gt The taxpayers themselves are effectively do not receive  euros as they are the ones paying for that amount so it nets as zeroNot in Germany. In Germany you face a marginal Tax rate of  if youre employed in the up and coming minimum wage jobs. Getting euro or  depending on what your country deems essential upfront from the state and paying  in taxes on labor income would be quite an improvement.gt The minimum wage will be at least  euros per month for everyone.The minimum wage is something that employers pay. This would not be  euro. Inflation would only increase if the state budget is not balanced.gt Immigration and welfare tourism would be a large problem.What makes you think so? Illegal Immigrants already see better terms of welfare here than locals and I dont see waves of immigrants. Also as far as tourism is concerned if they dont have their center of life a term already used in Germany for basic eligibility here then they wouldnt get it of course.gt Workers having to support such a system would either become resentful or start claiming basic income themselvesI talked about this before! If we systematically overtax the workers and under tax the capital gains as we have been of course the workers will stop being relevant for financing anything!gt Recent figures show the mean income after taxes in Ireland to be approx  euros per month. Wages would have to increase dramatically to still be attractive.Not at all! You could simply work in part time for  euros an hour at an employer that tells you how much he needs you and that youre a decent human being.

2634043,0,t3_2q352b,This is not what experiments with basic income show. One of the main effects of basic income has been revealed to be emancipationgt It had four effects most accentuated by the presence of the collective body.gt First it had strong welfare or capability effects. There were improvements in child nutrition child and adult health schooling attendance and performance sanitation economic activity and earned incomes and the socioeconomic status of women the elderly and the disabled.gt gt Second it had strong equity effects. It resulted in bigger improvements for scheduled caste and tribal households and for all vulnerable groups notably those with disabilities and frailties. This was partly because the basic income was paid to each individual strengthening their bargaining position in the household and community.gt gt Third it had growth effects. Contrary to what sceptics predicted including Sonia Gandhi the basic incomes resulted in more economic activity and work.gt gt Conventional labour statistics would have picked that up inadequately. There was a big increase in secondary economic activities as well as a shift from casual wage labour to ownaccount farming and smallscale business. Growth in village economies is often ignored. It should not be.gt gt Fourth it had emancipatory effects. These are unappreciated by orthodox development thinkers. The poors liberty has no value. But the basic income resulted in some families buying themselves out of debt bondage others paying down exorbitant debts incurring horrendous interest rates. For many it provided liquidity with which to respond to shocks and hazards. In effect the basic income responded to the fact that in such villages money is a scarce commodity and as such that has driven up its price locking most in a perpetual cycle of debt and deprivation.People pay off their debts and take on less debt. They invest in their homes. They invest in capital and start their own businesses. They start to grow their own wealth.Basic income creates a floor.

But I said if you live in a classy area people who are uncultured cannot afford to live there and people who can afford to live there treat their surroundings with class and style? And if you live in an unclassy area where people do this your home value is so low that it does not affect it? Apparently class tends to mean merely money and temporary money at that in America while over here it is more connected with culture style and oldish money.For this reason as I am not very classy I am actually an immigrant I dont even consider the rental prices of districts where th generation lawyers and dentist live.

3463902,0,t1_cpn3jhu,gt Straight up nope. Our current welfare model has a much more sinister disincentive built into it. Removing the benefits of people who make any amount of money is a much larger disincentive than providing them help unconditionally.gt gt gt gt Furthermore all of the evidence shows that this critique is simply false. Humans become more productive with a BI not less. This is because they have more freedom to pursue what they want and are more likely to work harder at something they love to do. Hes basing his views here off of the NIT studies I didnt cite the third world studies which do indicate increased work but I also dont necessarily see them as applicable to the situation.gtI dont really see the critique. Is the problem that a BI will increase demand for certain goods? So? Is the problem that employment will go up in places like China? Unless youre under the impression that the money is literally going to go from Americans to Chinese people with no benefit accrued Im failing to see the issue. It is an issue but as I mentioned both to him and as someone else mentioned in this thread this is more of an issue with global capitalism than anything.gtAh so youve just designed the model to fail. You seem to think that BI proponents are talking about taxing someone other then the slobbering wealthy trillionaires. I can see why you would draw such silly conclusions if youre using such a silly model. Hes referring to my flat tax model here. It is worth mentioning other models may tax people differently though.gtNOPE NOPE NOPE! You do not know what a progressive tax system should look like. Obviously if you tax away the benefit from the people who need it the system will fail. We arent talking regressive flat taxes. Were talking about a return to the progressive taxes of even before the Bush tax cuts. Again hes talking about my plan and while the tax is flat its actually quite progressive in practice taking UBI itself into consideration. Personally I dont understand how a progressive tax would work since it would involve the rich paying so much money theyd just leave and renounce their citizenship....a flat tax is necessary IMO in order to balance the benefits with the costs. ,BasicIncome,cpn3yey,1,t5_2v1jk

Now the problem I see here is that the majority of regional airlines only consider a pilot on the clock from the time he leaves the gate to his arrival at his destination.  So all in all they are putting in a greater amount of hours than they are being paid for.But the majority of pilots see flying for regional airlines as a type of apprenticeship and a stepping stone to working for large commercial airlines.The average salary for a copilot with  years experience at a commercial airline is k a year.

3638728,0,t1_cq6y79g,Wow thats a great response and very detailed.  Thank you for putting the time into that response.I guess the premise that Im uncomfortable with is where is this money supply going to come from?  The government cant keep printing an infinite amounts of money as eventually hyper inflation will probably occur.  I do disagree that we can disregard inflation and use an any amount is better than no amount approach.  Not sure if you have heard about the rule of  but it tells you how long it takes for money to double at any given interest rate.  You take  and divide by the interest rate which is .  Furthermore if you consider that inflation really started its climb after the Federal Reserve was created and go out roughly the  years of its existence you will see that it takes  today to buy what . bought back then becomes  in   in   in   in   in  and about  between  and  to arrive at   Or simply calculate ..  So any program tied to specific dollar amounts occasionally adjusted will be awesome for the generation that implements it as they will start with full purchasing power that dilutes over time.  But future generations will still be left struggling when they start out only being able to purchase  of what you did at a similar age.  Inflation has caused the issue we are currently in where wages have not kept up with inflation which necessitate  income homes then slowly creeping to  or  jobs required etc.  If we can make certain essentials inflation proof it will help our generation and all future generations.  With an occasional update you end up with a situation where Congress gets the inflation adjusted wagebecause they vote for their raises constantly where commoners get the dilluted amount represented the occasional and non guaranteed wage increase.As far as needing money to continue the economy Im a little torn on that premise.  The economy would definitely be different and go through a change but Im not entirely sure its all bad.  This premise basically means that you are always dependent on an entity to supply you with money for goods and services.  But people will be free to explore and monetize their own passionsi.e. self employment would become the norm rather than the exception.  The extras people could probably get just by bartering with others. Corporations would no longer have the power they have today since people would work for causes that they personally believed in and thus wouldnt be the empires that they are today.  A lot of current expenses would become unnecessary or would be greatly reduced.      There wouldnt be as much gas being used as people wouldnt be working as many hours or potentially at all in some cases.  That translates into less money on all those costs such as a portion of clothing and eating out expenses.  That means that there would be less people on the road.  Which in turn means less gas stations less police as traffic enforcesetc.  I think the economies would be more locally based with people working with each other.  This would naturally lead towards people spending more time with friends and family which would probably drive down health care costs since people will generally be happier.,BasicIncome,cq71j7t,1,t5_2v1jk

3657258,0,t1_cq90vfi,EDIT only after posting this did I realize how long this post was. I am very sorry.gt How do you distinguish free market socialism which you support from regulated capitalism with UBI and a social safety net which I support? Obviously capitalism tends toward monopoly and dynastic multigenerational wealth can be corrupting hence the need for regulation rather than the laissez faire approach but socalism is a solution in search of a problem.This is actually an excellent point. I suppose its more that I simply lean heavy toward the socialism part than the free market part. Where the line is drawn is blurry. I used to describe myself as a LeftLibertarian actually which is basically socialist libertarianism. Just capitalism with a UBI regulations universal Healthcare free education etc. And Id certainly be more happy with a system like that then how we have it now. thus my support as a reformist for UBIHowever I also see an inherent problem with private ownership where it can hyper concentrate wealth. So perhaps the line is the level of permitting that to occur. Whether it should be allowed at all and if so what sort of limitations would potentially make it more socialist than capitalist. I see outlawing or putting heavy restrictions on capital ownership in the same boat as not permitting monopolies to form not permitting trustspricefixing etc. I see owning capital in a sense is sort of high potential for being anticompetitive in of itself.gt Yes you pretty much can. Its ASTOUNDINGLY easy to start a business in the U.S. and requires very little capital to get going.Again I suppose the issue here is something wed agree with though if everyone started trying to make money this way even if they were all legitimately educated in the field and good at it theyd only have so many customers or interested parties. Sales would not be equally split between them there would be a very small percentage of them that would actually succeed. The rest would make themselves destitute. Which is precisely why you and I would support a UBI as it simply allows people to pick themselves back up from the ground and try again.But again to really become successful you do indeed need more that just a computer. IDK about you but I know that professional software for the purposes of development and services like advertising can be extremely expensive. And if you say want to literally own your own server space for a website for your product youd literally need to purchase and run a server. Im sure Im forgetting some things too. Sure you can make the claim that these arent necessary to start a business I would say that they are necessary to be successful. Then of course there are  lb gorillas that already have dominance in the sector you are trying to enter. If you started from scratch got some positive results those gorillas will take notice. Generally speaking unless they decide to buy you out which cans till be construed as bad for society anyway they can easily crush you in the marketplace before you become a real threat.A UBI alone certainly would make all of this far more doable of course  again why I support one as the time it took to get set up wouldnt squeeze you like a lemon as you tried just paying your bills. But I still think the issue of wealth concentration makes it harder to actually start a new business. Or at least one that maintains a modicum of success without being eaten or ripped off by a much stronger firm with the resources to blot you and your good idea out of the market. which indeed happensIm not against the free market Im against the fact that Capitalism allows such concentrated power and inequality within a free market.gt No its not. If you believe in socialism as a working model then you can find like minded people and start a socialist coop. If a capitalist business offers greater rewards and is more efficient and makes it harder to staff that is not a problem with capitalism but with socialism.Well socialism specifically the worker ownership aspect of socialism as a large scale working model is communism. And communism requires  saturation to really work. Sort of like how unions fall apart unless every employee is a part of it. Communism needs capitalism to simply not be. The existence of concentrated power that capitalism generates tends to corrupt the idea of a mutual existence of the  systems. Marx even believed that communism would need to be established on a global scale to work at all. Something Ill admit is probably impossible to do. I actually see a nonviolent means of transitioning from capitalism to communism. UBI is a part of that transition making it it less burdensome for competition to sprout and giving workers a leg to stand on when it comes to negotiating wages. But a more important step would be mandating that you simply cant hire someone unless you also give them a cut of the profits directly proportional to their contribution in producing that profit.gt How do you balance unfairnessinequality with the fact that people are in fact not equal? Shouldnt the folks that are more driven smarter more talented and harder working be able to derive the benefits from being such rather than limited to the benefits of the lowest common denominator worker? I can see limiting the ratio of pay between corporate officers and workers somewhat so that the CEO doesnt take home x the pay of the average worker but making the ratio  doesnt seem very useful either.I definitely believe that people should be rewarded proportionally to some degree but not on the basis of ethics of what they deserve but on the basis of common good. I agree that its important to incentivize the smart and talented people that exist with some form of additional reward because the things they produce is good for society.As for harder working this is completely separate from the above issue of talent or intellect. If you are a hard worker a smart if sociopathic worker could theoretically trick the hard worker into doing his or her job for them. Which is essentially what already happens often with people who own capital only instead of worker tricking worker its owner tricking worker by convincing them their pay is fair while they skim off the workers efforts. You could very well argue that private capital ownership is a talented individual using his social engineering skills to con people.But yes as a means to incentivize the talented and smart I totally agree that they should get better pay. But not because they intrinsically deserve it merely that society benefits from it when they have that incentive. Considering the fact that there is a point at which a financial reward stops mattering in terms of human happiness and merely becomes a tool of influence and authority I dont think the talented individuals of the word should necessarily get so much financial reward that they get to dictate how we run things. Ive read various things on the effects of earning over about k have a negligible effect on a individuals needs and ability to enjoy life. though there are a few different studies and the number varies a bit between k to kThe specific means and system for this of course matters quite a lot. Itd be quite the social engineering feat to compose a system that effectively rewarded talented workers while making sure that this doesnt simply pool power and influence into one place. But I think it can be done.Getting a bit into the philosophical I want to point out an important reason why I think that a talented individual do not deserve intrinsically a better life than his or her fellows. The universe is some combination of deterministic and chaotic but it is not inherently just. When a person becomes talented or smart or skilled or educated there is always an aspect of simple luckchance involved. Whether it be in actual physical or monetary inheritance social inheritance Community or culture that encourages them even when you fail and even the mental make up of successful people whether than be being born with a supernaturally fast durable or well oiled machine of a brain. If you are successful luck smiled on you somewhere. Hell even in a theoretically successful communist system you are lucky in the temporal sense to be born into the system to begin with rather than any other time.This is actually an aspect of religious and spiritual perspectives where people think that things happen to people for a reason and this mental trick is used to justify inequality. Inequality is only justified when it has measurable benefits on the whole of humanity meaning using it as an incentive is justified but not as an intrinsic good.And I say this as a person with the polar opposite perspective when it comes to the virtual or simulated or cases of play. IE sports games contests etc. are valuable in that they can safely display inequalities without hurting anyone and allows us to improve as individuals. And I think attempting to handicap or use asymmetry to bring people up to other experts level artificially is an awful idea. But life and the universe isnt a game.,BasicIncome,cq95iqh,1,t5_2v1jk

I am assuming that SNAP recipients are average people with a similar cross section of knowledge about food preparation. A walk through the typical supermarket shows that the vast majority of foods on offer are processedinstant foods and not foods that require cooking knowledge or skill to prepare. On average open microwave serve is the order of the day in America. But in deference I could probably have worded it better. It was never my intention to come off as though I was somehow better or God forbid I do it so those lazy schmucks should just do it too. I thought I made it clear that this was a choice for me that not everyone would choose.You make this sound like I look down on SNAP recipients which is simply not the case. Im not after SNAP folks here. My original post was more directed at some of the stuff Ive seen on several right wing blogs about how it would be so easy for SNAP folks to live on the luxurious amount of US a week. I pointed out that I did this out of choice and was enabled by resources in my community ample inexpensive grocery stores sufficient yard space to grow food etc and circumstances in my life a lot of free time to forage and prepare food that made this easy for me not necessarily for others to do. I understand that for many folks who receive SNAP benefits they are working two or three jobs have kids live in a small space and lack transportation so their only choice is a bodega selling overpriced and inferior quality foods. Providing quality food is a systemic problem in a country with an out of control obesity problem that is largely the result of people all people being sold a bill of goods by multinational food producers. ,BasicIncome,cqhgc9h,1,t5_2v1jk

3819074,0,t3_3457il,Well its very expensive and would likely not adequately cover certain target populations in and of themselves. While the work effort reductions are not very large in context they still exist and could pose problems if UBI is too generous or the clawback system poorly implemented. Some might see work as too punitive or resent the high tax rates DESPITE getting a basic income to offset that.Another problem is certain populations may require more help. While the average citizen knows how to spend money fine some addictsalcoholicsex convicts or whatever may not spend it properly. While we have no reason to believe this is a large proportion of the population people like this nevertheless exist.Alternatively other UBI plans may be too meager cutting much of the safety net only to replace it with something thats inferior in many ways.In a strong economy that already has lots of spending stimulus it could theoretically cause inflation although the federal reserve could likely counter that by influencing interest rates. As you can tell most arguments against UBI dont necessarily work against the concept of UBI but against specific UBI plans.You can have generous UBIs but this could come at the cost of excessively high tax rates andor work reductions andor inflation. You could have meager UBis but this comes at the cost of the program not living up to its projected goals. Its kind of hard to pin down the concepts of giving people money causing problems it really ultimately depends on how. The biggest problem is likely getting a plan that maintains a workable coalition that wants it implemented. Some people would reject high benefit plans citing excessive taxation or work reductions while others would reject low benefit plans as not being enough. Its incredibly hard to come up with a UBI plan that satisfies everyone while still doing a decent job at obtaining goals.,BasicIncome,cqrlsy2,2,t5_2v1jk

The Great Depression is a great example of government meddling ending in disaster.gt I said the market isnt an intelligent being and therefore cant make our decisions for us. They work well with proper regulation. Like a minimum wage to start with.The market is the best way of making most economic decisions. This is well established by economists. People simply arent capable of taking into account the many factors that must go into a decision. Markets help us by using prices that result from the equilibrium of supply and demand to decide what and how much of what should be produced. Its an emergent property of the system that it efficiently allocates resources for the most part. There can certainly be market failures which can be corrected by simple taxes and regulations. But sweatshops in third world countries are not an example of this.By the way there is no evidence that the minimum wages helps the poor.

Full text of his response follows.Thank you for contacting me to share your views regarding carbon tax proposals.  I appreciate hearing your thoughts on this matter and welcome the opportunity to respond.Energy is critical to our way of life. Its what heats our homes fuels our cars and its cost certainly has an impact on our wallets. The energy policies of our nation affect the environment our relations with other nations and our national security. Over the years some economists and Members of Congress have proposed a carbon tax as a way to raise federal revenue and reduce carbon dioxide CO and greenhouse gas GHG emissions. For example one such proposal has been to place a tax on emissions generated by power plants. Proponents argue that this would increase needed revenue improve the environment and encourage renewable energy use. Opponents however point out that the tax will inevitably increase many consumer costs from home bills to gasolineas well as damage economic growth and hinder job creation. In response Representative Steve Scalise RLA introduced a resolution that would express the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy. H.Con.Res. . This resolution has been referred to the Ways and Means Committee for further review. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee I will be sure to keep your thoughts in mind should this legislation come before me.I believe national energy policy should embrace an allofthe above energy strategy. We should conserve and make more efficient use of existing energy sources. We should further encourage the diversification of our energy supply through incentives for the development of alternative and renewable energy. The choices we make now to attain energy independence and conserve resources may be among the most significant decisions of our times.  We must drive innovation research and marketbased strategies to achieve a secure and prosperous future and leave our children and grandchildren a nation better than the one we inherited.Is he just telling me to pay no attention to the carbon behind the curtain or what?,BasicIncome,cqzbj98,1,t5_2v1jk

I wonder what that limit is and how it exhibits. fascinating subject.So... the rules of the real estate marketplace define... presently at this time in most US jurisdictions... that some mils of the assessed value of the property be paid to the jurisdiction annually.  In the land value tax  I know a patch of land near here that sold on the market for K.  If thats its value and I need to pay say K typical local house   mils   a year that would require an  LVT.

That being said these are the angles I typically use when trying to persuade people. . Cost  UBI would potentially allow us to gut a lot of the meansbased welfare programs or at least reduce their scope. Rather than having to pay a bunch of bureaucrats to wrangle all these different programs. You have one organization which dispenses payments and cut out a bunch of middlemen. If they believe in cutting all safety nets then point out theyre idiots and that leads to a massive spike in crime and increased costs due to having to pay to imprison people. . Reclaiming free money from the banks  As economies continue to grow more money has to be made to prevent deflationary pressures. To dumb this down a lot banking firms currently gain a lot of the benefit of seniorage or the profit off the creation of new money due to how The Federal Reserve Treasury and private banks interact and the fractional reserve system. Instead of letting the already capital heavy industry benefit the most from this printing. It could instead be handed out to the citizens and the fractional reserve system done away with. Banks still have a roll as intermediaries between would be investors and those seeking loans but they no longer gain the massive amounts of money possible to be made from utilizing their privileged role as a source of new money for the economy.

It provides services and pays for it from those taxes whether or not you want them.How can you compete with that?gtIts like the freedom VS security debate. You can never be completely free nor completely safe. But you can find a middle ground that optimizes both freedom and security without sacrificing one completely. Otherwise you end up pretty secure in solitary confinement or completely free and terrified of being murdered.I agree with the dichotomy of freedom vs. security. However do think that removing the State honoring individual rights private property amp voluntaryism interactions and conducting things through a free market would do just that. It wouldnt guarantee any single ideology but it would allow it assuming individuals valued that and were willing to exchange their moneypropertylaboretc for it.

Derivative values for example can total many times more than the sums of the individual mortgages that make them up. The risk is hedged and insured so there is really no risk. AIG was backstopped by the Fed for example so that Goldman Sachs got the full value of its hedges on mortgagebacked securities. GS actually got more than just a hedge because they write contracts in such a way as to trigger immediate large payouts in the case of a credit downgrade which happened to AIG. And the Fed was there to make sure the contracts were honored. UBS wrote the same style contracts with Detroit but the Fed didnt bail out Detroit. Why not? It should have.

I cooked cleaned managed her medicines and maintained her oxygen machines grocery shopped arranged doctors appointments etc. I really couldnt hold a job during the two years I lived with her.

4879726,0,t1_cu9lsb9,Again this mindset calls back to the cold war. You hear the words welfare or Democratic Socialist and just immediately associate those with bad. Democratic Socialism isnt the same as outright socialism and welfare serves a purpose too.First off economically welfare has the chance to save the nation money overall. If you take the time to look youll find plenty of reports discussing how its cheaper to provide homes to the homeless than to provide medical care for all the problems being homeless brings. This is actually a trend usually its far cheaper to just provide something like housing or food than to deal with the costs of not providing that. That means as a taxpayer we actually pay more to keep people in a state of suffering.Second the social reasons behind welfare are plentiful. A basic increase in the overall quality of life of those who struggle most and greater opportunity to those who otherwise might not have it. If a child can grow up to become a scientist instead of wasting his youth trying to help feed his family or worse turning to crime out of desperation then welfare would have done more good than harm.And what harm would there be? I hear people say that there are welfare queens who abuse the system. While Im sure there are a few the number is far lower than what people expect its similar to voter fraud on that account. There is a system being abused however but it isnt the poor doing it. Its the people who can hire a few dozen lawyers to comb over the tax code that applies to them for loopholes that abuse the system but I have yet to meet a homeless person with a team of lawyers who can help him abuse the welfare code.The other argument is usually that people would become dependent on the state but the sad thing is people already are dependent on the aid of others and its sporadic at best.

If that were the case even if the MoP were still owned by private entities those entities would effectively just be managing the MoP for the rest of society. While still technically capitalism I think the spirit and outcomes of such a system would be much more in line with socialism than capitalism.Since with BI everyone would be entitled to year of the fruits of the MoP the owners of the MoP would slide a bit closer to merely being the people tasked with managing the MoP for the rest of society which IMO would mean that while the system is still capitalism by definition in both spirit and individual outcomes we would have moved unambiguously further away from laissez faire capitalismtowards socialism.,BasicIncome,cvkshb0,2,t5_2v1jk

That means assets not movingstackedup cashdont impact inflation this makes sense  stockpiled assets arent being paid for production so dont reflect the price of goods and that what all goods are sold for represents what all money can buy.I explain buying power as equivalent to productive output meaning if you make  pounds of rice and have a total business and personal income of  your  is worth the same as  when you make  pounds of rice and have a total income across population of .  Likewise if you make  pounds of rice and have no use for  pounds you dont stockpile it or you stockpile it until it spoils youve got  pounds of rice produced and a bunch of people being paid to do nothing because making shit were just going to throw in the trash is doing nothing.Given these rough guides we recognize a few things Inflation occurs as more currency represents the same amount of goods  if we have  more goods produced and  more income we have inflation. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of old debt it effectively pays down the buying power of old debt. ... as such it also reduces the payments on that debt   billion in  is more than  billion in . As theres a gap between the value of an amount of currency at one time and the value of that same amount of currency in a future time you can raise the number of units of currency and still have less.That means everclimbing debt can be the same or less debt over time.  If the United States gets trillions and trillions of dollars more debt year over year but it represents a smaller and smaller portion of total buying power then the United States actually has less debt year over year.That means you can run an evergrowing deficit on your balance sheets taking on more and more debt making more payments forever but the actual load of debt is shrinking.

Things were good enough and people were making lots of money.Unfortunately it became assumed that an employer would provide this coverage. No one expected more than  unemployment after WWII. No one expected the private companies to be consolidated into the behemoths they are today. No one expected a need to change the system. So were stuck with the systems and institutions that were created so long ago. And it assumes an employer will pay for the health care of their employees because thats how its always been.,BasicIncome,cxfzoco,3,t5_2v1jk

For example it would allow dependent spouses who are currently trapped in physically emotionally or sexually abusive marriages to get a divorce and leave their abusive partner without being forced to live on the streets or in homeless shelters.On the other hand basic income would decrease the stress and pressure that is currently on relationships. If people didnt need to work multiple jobs to pay the bills they would be able to talk to their partners again and resolve issues and basic income would make it easier to afford to see a marriage counselor which help save a marriage that would have otherwise ended in divorce if not for basic income.In either case I think it would definitely be a net benefit to peoples mental health and level of happiness.,BasicIncome,cyujqei,1,t5_2v1jk

I dont necessarily mean that the US can shut down and export X I mean the US can shut down its borders entirely redesign itself internally and never have to worry about the global market if it wants to no imports no exports thats ultimate protectionism its also essentially North Korea. The country has the capability. it would become the social outcast of the world but its within the realm of doable. To protect their internal companies nations need tariffs at least as it stands now. It shouldnt have to be this way but it is currently.    For example hypothetical Country A has a company that makes X. Country B wants to get into the X market Country B can subsidize the manufacturing of X and export it to Country A Country A wants the cheap X. But if Country Bs X is cheaper than Country As X the company in Country A will collapse and Country A can no longer make X as there is no point to making a product that Country B makes for cheaper. After the collapse of Country As company Country B can just raise the prices on exports. To counter this Country A uses a tariff to equalize the market value of X to Country As prices. This excess value is revenue for the country and keeps Country As company from failing without using a bailout or subsidizing the production of X.   ,BasicIncome,cyur55u,1,t5_2v1jk

6289978,0,t3_41quf3, You cant eat education. Education does not mitigate immediate poverty. Its not very good at mitigating poverty in general too. check numbers on employment of college educated people especially with regard to the education needed for their jobs. Earning a gold star for effort college education to score a job at McDonalds is not just cynical its also wasteful of the resources that went into providing education. Most practical schemes today that tie immediate poverty relief to being enrolled inflate the cost of education. as they provide an incentive to picking up any education whatsoever immediate poverty relief. But education is only as good as the plan you have for putting it to good use. College education is not a requirement to becoming an entrepreneur. Nor does it seem obvious to me that itd help much with that it however can help with becoming good at being an entrepreneur if theres an established discipline for what you want to do.. A schooling system with more emphasis on creative problem finding and solving and a practical perspective to apply such in your future life would help there. A basic income could provide the perspective.Only dignified access to the essentials of life can help us build an inclusive society where people can leverage their unique skills. Opportunities to acquire knowledge to support that pursuit are useful too so Im all for considering free higher education a desirable policy as well. But it doesnt improve poverty much. Poverty is a huge hurdle in getting people interested and engaged in education or anything intrinsically motivated or risky like entrepreneurship by the wayA little more practical perspective No education in the world will let you start  businesses in  years of which  fail and  has a decent shot at maybe becoming something. So if you really want to bet on entrepreneurs give people the tools to become entrepreneurs. People want to live modest but decent lives too. Lifes about enjoying after all. We cant just ask any and all people to live their lives in shame that their entrepreneurial efforts arent going so well  of the time or more.Success is built on previous failures after all. Be it the person failing learning something or others learning from the failure appropriating useful parts and cutting the useless ones. Therefore even if people fail for most of their lives there can be dignity in that. As long as society recognizes it and lends the individual a hand to continue on.Not to speak of success one can experience outside of the market but thats a different story. I myself am all for leveraging the free market for improving our society through entrepreneurs after all. Just saying that people arent failures in any sense of the word even if they never succeed on the market for a reason or another.

The quantity theory of money invents fudge factors such as Velocity to make it seem plausible in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.Second reexamine Weimar. Weimar was a case of too few dollars chasing too many goods. There was no physical shortage of food in Weimar. There was a shortage of US dollars imposed artificially by the French and the British demanding reparations from the brand new republic.The shortage of dollars was somewhat addressed by the Dawes Plan which loaned Weimar US dollars and rescheduled the reparation payments.Inflation is psychological not a physical consequence of increasing the money supply. The perverse psychology of inflation is best dealt with through full indexation of all incomes to price rises. Thus purchasing power does not decrease.,BasicIncome,d19e3x2,1,t5_2v1jk

7901436,0,t3_4nfyzd,gtA lot of people are going to decide that it isnt I dont blame them. I have worked in bars and factories and I remember counting the hours. I certainly wouldnt go if I didnt have to. So a lot of people would become voluntarily unemployed.Actually it depends on the amount given. I dont think this would be bad in moderation as I think a refusal by some to work would increase wages and working conditions. While it would come at the extent of higher costs an important piece youre missing is purchasing power. It doesnt matter if prices go up a bit if the increased purchasing power for many at the bottom and even middle outpaces the increases in price.gtPoints  and  mean there will be a lot less jobs. I guess we need to bear in mind that a great many people have decided to be unemployed anyway.Yeah what really matters is the unemployment rate. If businesses find ways to make the stuff anyway without labor then so what if people quit. Sounds like people get to do what they want and everyone wins.gtRegarding point  we have a word for increased prices. We call it inflation. All those increased prices will feed back to the goods and services we buy. Everything will be more expensive. Probably significantly more expensive.Im going to refer you to the purchasing power argument I just made.gtSo suddenly the BI isnt enough to live on anymore and has to be increased to keep up with inflation which in turn creates more wage inflation. Maybe it would balance out eventually? Im not sure how. The basic problem is that even if it could be funded BI would keep the market value of labour at an artificially high level.It really depends on implementation whether this is a good or bad thing. If UBI causes stagflation or something yeah we overdid it. If it simply increases prices of goods and services by a small but manageable amount that to me is a sign of a healthy economy. Either way UBI would likely be implemented slowly and be below the threshold in which people quit en masse all at once so we can monitor the effects and hit the brakes in the event that your nightmare scenario happens.gtIve read the Medium article by Scott Jenson in which he states that BI would mean groceries might end up costing you an extra . percent per month. That is based on an article about Walmart and only Walmart paying a living wage. That is a decidedly different thing to a massive wage inflation across all sectors and pay grades. How do people write this stuff?Oh noes! The horror!Oh wait people would be making more money so they could pay it!gtAdvocates seem to think that by giving everyone a BI youd be doing them some big favour. Actually for many people what it would mean is that they would be unable to sell their labour because noone is willing to pay the artificially high price for it.I thought you were just complaining about the fact that people wouldnt work?gtPeople would not be able to justify to themselves working full time in an unskilled job for only a small increase above their BI. But they wouldnt be able to sell their labour for a price that was worth it either. Its a Catch situation.First of all I think youre still going on about nightmare scenarios whereas the effects of BI would be smaller if properly managed.Second if two parties cant come to an agreeable business arrangement maybe they shouldnt. If a business doesnt wanna pay people and a worker doesnt want to work maybe they shouldnt. Thats known as voluntarily engaging or choosing not to engage in the free market.gtHilariously Ive seen people writing that BI would reduce stigma against the unemployed. What world do these people live in? Society would be segregated into workers and nonworkers. How do you think these two groups will perceive each other?It really depends on how many are in each group and how solidly defined the groups are. If work were to become more voluntary with people occasionally engaging in it and then taking time off the lines between the two groups blur a lot. Also you gotta keep in mind people who work would still get the UBI. Yes they would pay taxes on their earnings but this would function similarly to say milton friedmans negative income tax. The way I see it by having a system in which everyone clearly plays by the same rules and those rules are transparent I think there would be less animosity between the two groups because the perception that theyre stealing from one group and giving to another would disappear. It would be a third rail of politics like social security. The only group that would really be paying out the  for UBI is the top  and theyre a minority as far as politics go. Although they might run propaganda to piss people off and make them vote against their interests like they always do.Thats really the source of opposition for many major government expansions. its the rich not liking their interests infringed upon so they work up masses of angry people and get them to oppose stuff that actually benefits a lotof them. gtThe workers will see the nonworkers as slackers and scroungers and they will resent paying for them.I already covered this. I dont think it would be as simple.gtDo you imagine that the nonworkers still sit around all day writing novels playing the piano growing organic vegetables and generally feeling fulfilled? Not likely.How do you know what they will and wont do?gtThe nonworkers often not able to work even if they want to for the reasons described above will be marginalised bitter resentful of their economic redundancy. Idleness for thats what it would mean for many would lead to large increases in crime drink drugs mental health problems etc.First of all your big argument for wages being so high is people refusing to work at lower wages. Seems like voluntary unemployment to me. Second without being coerced economically to participate and their needs taken care of maybe they wouldnt be so bitter. Theyre only bitter because we beat work ethic into people and make them feel like crap if they dont comply UBI could lead to a cultural shift here.I also sense a lot of protestant work ethic here that idle hands do the devils work and people need to be saved from idleness by work blah blah blah. I dont believe that at all. Its a load of garbage. The reason poor people commit crimes is desperation. There may be some truth to economic disenfranchisement but lets keep in mind youre arguing they wouldnt work at a lower price theyre choosing not to work. Huge than not being able to woek and wanting to.gtUBI owes its popularity as an idea because it has the happy sideeffect of making political idealists feel virtuous by advocating it Im pretty sure that when advocates imagine a UBI world they are one of the workers. Maybe ministering in some capacity to the grateful masses? Well remunerated for their efforts of course.im a  year old. I got a masters degree. I graduated into a hostile economy a few years ago realized our economic system is bull and that we need a paradigm shift. I am for UBI because I believe it would help me and millions of other people. gtIts a utopian idea designed to work in a world that doesnt exist.

Dont get me wrong I think taking care of people is actually one of the most productive in a noneconomics sense things one could do.  But in an economics sense it is not as much as other things potentially could be. In fact in some ways it is seen as a potential problem for growth.

Would you disagree?gt I dont think UBI will work until military spending is drastically cut.The United States is the wealthiest nation by any reasonable metric to ever exist. While gradual reallocating the federal budget from military to social spending would certainly simplify the implementation of UBI doing so is hardly necessary.The money is already there. Its simply untaxed poorly distributed and arguably misallocated. The  wealthiest Americans alone constituting less than . of the American population claim assets in excess of  trillion USD constituting  of the U.S. federal budget of . trillion.Its a matter of societal political and cultural priorities.

In my experience this view is generally advocated by Libertarians who sorry to paint with such a broad stroke here Libs... but this is what Ive seen... tend to have a polyanna view about how wealth is amassed and take a more philosophical standpoint based on an idealized market which starts from a blank slate. This stance ignores the many historical instances both gross and subtle of violence coercion and corruption. Not ALL wealth comes from this  much of it is from good old hard work  but quite a bit of it does.I generally try to expose folks who argue taxation is theft to the equally plausible viewpoint that property is theft. Probably the most obvious example of this would be how people of European descent own land in North America. This continent was not acquired cleanly.So all that having been said Ive found that you dont get anywhere by arguing with people. Especially in public. Human egos are way too fragile and we all love nothing more than to dig in our heels and amass data to support our current views.

8570277,0,t1_d6cqnoh,gtThe reasonably in your sentence is policy not physical necessity. The Fed proved it can backstop marketcreated obligations with unlimited liquidity in .Yes by swapping illiquid claims with liquid ones.  It didnt create unlimited money nor does it have the power to.  It swapped some kinds of financial assets for other kinds and then eventually ended up selling them all back at a profit anyway.There is no way to completely eliminate financial risk.  The best way we have to deal with it so far is to put it off and hope that the real economy eventually catches back up when less constrained by past unmet obligations.  Obligations can be unmet and when that happens the claims to those obligations are undermined.  This is because these are obligations to real value not money or even financial assets generally but something to be brought to a market and sold.You can subdivide the claims all you like it doesnt diminish the obligations that created them or make it easier for those obligations to be met.  Doing that requires an ongoing redistribution of claims and obligations not merely the arbitrarily increasing of them without reference to anything real.  And this is a necessity because marketbased capitalism tends towards monopolistic coercion.  The playing field has to be tilted not simply changing the scale.,BasicIncome,d6cv6vw,2,t5_2v1jk

Hence while one might be more likely but not guaranteed to be quite unhappy about being unemployed in the very specific societal construct we have it does not mean that unemployed people are generally unhappy. to be fair his wording is pretty unfortunate given these statistics never make a statement about individual happiness but merely about statistical likelyhood for the person in the situation to experience the situation in a negative fashion compared to other situations. So by him admiting such a statistic to be true he merely admits to some likelyhood for people to be more unhappy with the situation with no regard to cause and effect on people who do happen to experience such unhappyness.

I would finally be free to relentlessly chase my passions instead of mostly my tail. When Im not working toward lifeterm goals such as helping to resolve manmade climate change and advocating UBI elsewhere advocating decentralized networks free open and fast internet and advocating alternative energies I would be writing an epic sciencefiction novel  to begin with and with the help of UBI I would launch several startups that have been in the wings due to high barrier to entry costs. Several will be related to green energy and electric transport. One will be related to home automation to improve QoL using wifi and induction motors I have a rough sketch for a new type of induction motor but its not required I wouldnt have to worry about people stealing the idea because there will be more ways to reach audiences with UBI  besides existing and new methods to outinnovate competitors. Speaking of that...I would help develop a Global Annual Innovators Award conference likely in Paris  Enjoy wine cheese and ...espresso where we pledge to award the worlds best Innovators and Problem Solvers each year. I would help create a similar event for Authors of the world. I would maybe not allow any corporate sponsors for this event it would be entirely crowdfunded. I would Travel... Another startup would be local and fitness focused a franchise perhaps featuring entertaining obstacle courses at multiple difficulty levels kids beginner intermediate parkour and expert levels... Another would be a new type of  skateboard. Using my experience with CAD I would save for a bit and invest in specialized Dprinting tech and bring some of my on paper inventions to reality one of which is a new type of cart that can move nearly effortlessly adjust its height and can easily go upstairs with a simple push... another is a new type of Mars rover that uses a new technique for movement... I would enter the NASA annual rover competition. Another is a new type of projector that can function in daylight...I have many other detailed plans.... With UBI I would finally get my teeth fixed... buy some lessragged clothes both of which would help overcome my depression. I would spend more time swimming for exercise and get much more sleep. I would be able to afford more vegetables and eat much more healthy food. I would socialize more. Im confident that my improvement in health will push me to develop much much more I would like to help others solve the problem of PaUH Proving a Unique Human to enable global verifiable online voting. I would write many more ebooks and perhaps novels. I would probably be able to have much more time to take more indepth engineering and physics courses during the evenings and work toward helping enhance battery tech maybe eink tech similar to Qualcomms Mirasol. Speaking of displays.. I would contribute to developing new types of user interfaces that work with microsized projection technology and existing smartphones. When on vacation or travelling far I would probably give a go at writing some orchestral music. In general I would advocate more support for apps like Plag. I would develop fun critical thinking programscoursesapps and definitely games probably boardgames for youths.

Im one of those who advocate mo because we can fund that with no new taxes.If I received the mo probably not much would change. If I received the mo thats popular in this sub and if I knew for that it were for life...Id have some tough choices to make. isnt very much if you have have a real job. But if you dont...its kind of a lot of money. I think most people dont realize how expensive it is to have a job and live a conventional lifestyle. There are a lot of things you can do that are un conventional that lean towards dream fantasy lifestyle that you can potentially do if you dont have to life in a certain place in a certain way and have a car that takes you to a job in that certain place.For example I used to live on a sailboat. Columbia  docked in a slip at Dana Point in Orange County. Its one of the most expensive places in the entire world to live. I lived there in basically a miniyacht. How much did it cost me? month. Free electricity free water  for laundry showers a  minute walk from my slip. mo for wireless internet access from the harbor company. That plus your cellphone and youre looking at mo. Restaurants grocery stores bars a gym and the beach all within walking distance no need to own a car. And if you want one temporarily for some reason you just rent one for a couple days. I had basic kitchen facilities on my boat a microwave and BBQ grill but if you dont like to cook you just eat out every meal. Figure mo for food and toiletries and that leaves you mo to spend on whatever. All while living a reasonably idyllic lifestyle hanging out on your boat frolicking with beach babes during the day and partying every night. And you live on a boat so if you want to take some of your friends on vacation and go sailing for a weekend or a week...the oceans right there.Contrast that to paying mo for your mortgage plus  HOA dues plus property tax plus mo for your car another  for insurance another  on gas....all for the privilege of living close enough to your job that you hate that you only have to spend  minutes driving to it each way on a daily basis.mo in genuinely passive income like UBI would be in some places is easily worth thousands more than similar income living a conventional house near your job kind of lifestyle.What do you enjoy? What do you want to do with your life? Want to go on a perpetual roadtrip? Buy an RV or a partybus or retrofit one yourself and you can easily roadtrip forever on mo. You like skiing? Ive seen rentals in Tahoe for month. Buy your own equipment and a typical season pass is only about . Thats less than mo over a year. That leaves you mo for food and busfare. How many people dream even spending even a week or two at a ski resort? With mo and no need to own a car or pay a mortgage or go back to your job ever you could do it full time monthin monthout pretty easily. Whats your hobby? Skiing? Skydiving? Mountain climbing? SCUBA? You want to fly airplanes? Whatever it is odds are good you can find a way to do it on mo.How about this You want to live in the Bahamas? Do have a girlfriend? Do you have a friend with a girlfriend?Here you go Beachfront condo in the Bahamas right on the beach  With a pool within sight of the beach just to be decadent. Only . Thats half the appraised value of the house Im living in now and my house is not within sight of the beach in the Bahamas. Plugging  into a generic mortgage calculator nothing down at current interest rates thats only month. So you and your girlfriend and your friend and his girlfriend each put in  and that leaves you each mo for food and fun in your tropical island fantasy paradise lifestyle. And hey...one day your friends girlfriend freaks out and leaves and your friend backs out and your girlfriend wants to go home? So what? Drop everything and go. Theres no risk. If you have to walk away from your equity who cares? Just drop it and move onto whatever other fun fantasy idyllic lifetime you want from the list. Theres no risk or attachment to anything because you can pretty much just do whatever you want whenever you want.Theres so much you could do with mo if it were genuinely free and clear and completely passive income.If I were handed mo free and clear forever...Id pick something. Id drop everything in my life right now and just pick up and go. And if I didnt like it so what? Just drop it and go do something else.You cant do that with a mortgage.

10293612,0,t1_dcasras,My opinion is this. The spectrum of debate and peoples opinions are WAY more malleable than they come off as. The reason we force home all this stuff about work and the american dream and crap is to basically brainwash the populace. Were cultivating a population willing to work long hours for less money. We make up this concept of individualism and bash welfare because we convince people that this is in their best interests. But it is propaganda it is cultural brainwashing and indoctrination. lets call it like it is. Were framing peoples perceptions were playing on their feelings were manufacturing outrage for political gain. by we I dont mean us on this sub I mean the country. We might as well have a big sign saying work makes you free on the gates of america. We are horrified when the nazis did such a thing but are our attitudes toward work as a country really much better? I dont think so.So where does this come in with us?We need to change the narrative. We need to fight this message. We need to establish our own competing message. We have to convince people that UBI is in their best interests and it is. We need to break down the mcarthyist indoctrination weve instilled in people against left wing ideas and i think in the current climate UBI is best served by the left like wealth redistribution and convince people that yes there really is a class war going on yes you are on the losing side and if you want to win and make your life better support this program. I think we need to expose what the elites are doing expose the propaganda for what it is and put forward an alternate message for how things should be. This will be difficult because the program the elites have put in most americans heads cant easily be broken and even those who understand something is wrong like the trump guys often dont have a clear understanding of what it actually is. We need to educate we need to inform we need advocate for the kind of world we want to see. A successful UBI will make the average persons life better or at the very least not make it worse toward the middle of the spectrum. It has to be in the majority of the peoples interests. The big problem the middle class has with left wing policies as they see it as them subsidizing the poor to lie around and not work while they have to do all of it. As such we need to ensure the middle is not affected negatively by UBI and helped if anything. Yes those arguments will still apply to the rich but if we can convince  of the population UBI is in their interests we can counteract that. I really do see the problem with the narratives you make and the like as actual brainwashingindoctrinationpropaganda by the rich to secure their position and turn the middle class against the poor. obama talked briefly about that last night. But even he doesnt seem to understand or is ironically being hypocritical on the matter the extent to which our propaganda as a nation is intended to benefit a certain order of things and that this benefits the financial elite. I think if these issues were framed differently we could win people over. After all the demographics who now support people like trump back in the day were staunch FDR supporters. Again we need to break through all the propaganda and brainwashing and consent manufacturing and tell the people the truth. The rich are making up these narratives because it makes them easier for them to control you and screw you over and our ideas actually would make your life better and give you freedom. This is what the people need to hear. This is what they need to accept. ,BasicIncome,dcau4sg,2,t5_2v1jk

Tax needs to be collected the issue is how to do that.You think we should indirectly tax productivity in the form of income tax and capital gains. Why do you think that would have a different effect than directly taxing productivity? Why would one system reduce incentive to automate but not the other system? Why would you prefer the more complicated system which forces businesses as well as all those people who have income or capital gains to pay taxes instead of the more simplified system which only requires businesses to be taxed?A direct tax on productivity is more efficient that having multiple indirect taxes on productivity and would make it more difficult for businesses to avoid paying their fair share of tax.,BasicIncome,dd7f2j3,1,t5_2v1jk

10757869,0,t3_5ttn3v,Its going to be hard to couple proof of work with demurrage from an early point I think. The incentive to create coins through work is tenuous when the work essentially devalues. It requires productsservices on offer to stimulate production of coins so they may be spent. Proof of work coins by their nature encourage pump and dump by early adopters in currency exchanges. IMO bitcoin type tech is largely designed as a get rich quick scheme rather than a vehicle for social liberation.Ive been looking at ways to create markets of goodsservices for a UBI coin created at timed intervals. My current thought is coins are only created in response to a transaction which builds market value for the coin. It would be a bit like the Fed issuing currency to everyone each day but only if they buy something with it. Of course this requires a core group of individuals to put up goodservices establishing the market. Participation by people interested in couch surfing for instance could begin to establish value in the currency while increasing temporary housing availability. For myself I might list a number of the items around my house I want to get rid of rather than donating them to a thrift store for resell.Basically I think the key to unlocking crypto coins for the masses is in focusing on creating real goodsservices exchanges that people lacking resources can tap into. ,BasicIncome,ddple6v,1,t5_2v1jk
