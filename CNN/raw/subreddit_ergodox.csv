6583648,0,t3_45hmql,I bought an Ergodox about a month ago... I type with the wrong finger mainly just C and M and its a bit of an adjustment.  I still goof it up a bit but I havent went full on ErgoDox all the time.. I find that I can find the keyboard quicker when playing games with a standard keyboard.  I like it but it makes me slow.  Im sure if I stayed on the ErgoDox for a month I would be able to adjust but its that month of pain Im having a hard time getting through.  keybr.com is a lot of help,ergodox,d00axh2,1,t5_2zb95
