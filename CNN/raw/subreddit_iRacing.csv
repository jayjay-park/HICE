135991,0,t3_1vn5uh,Race position has no impact on SR. Only the number laps technically the number of corners per incident or CPI matter. So gaining  positions doesnt mean anything. You could have finished last and it would have been the same.Im surprised you lost SR with only  incidents in a Rookie race though. What license class are you? At the higher levels the incident points hit your SR more. I have an A license and if I get more than  incidents in a race Im almost always guaranteed to lose SR. A x in a race usually means . or more. But if youre Rookie or class D a x in a  lap race shouldnt have cost you SR.Did you have incidents in warmup too? Those count albeit at a lower rate. But if you spun a few times in warmup those xs or a bunch of x offtracks could have added to the SR loss.,iRacing,cetx3v6,5,t5_2s3h8

1540535,0,t1_cj9ceu3,I actually dont believe this to be true  of the time.Qualification shows you can put down a fast lap. Thats great but thats qualification that shows very little about somebodys ability to drive safely. They might find themselves ahead of the chaos which will make it easier to prevent large pileups but even then they can still spin or not consider the other drivers near them.Sure faster drivers have a tendency to be slightly cleaner but what if you dont feel confident in your abilities? What if theyre fast but cant race around other drivers to save their life? I find this more often in oval due to singlecar qualification sessions but this is just my observationUltimately it isnt how fast they can drive Im A class road but iRating of only  I consider that slow since I finish middle of the pack but rather how consistent and how mindful they are of other cars around them.Sometimes you dont qualify the fastest and get placed in the middle of the grid as well. Then what? Youre boxed in and most likely to be collected all for that chance of being ahead of the chaos.Start in the back or the pits youre taking less chances that way. If theyre somewhat new to iRacing then advertising them to drive very quickly to be ahead of the chaos isnt the best idea. Let them get some practice under their belt and then they can start to find some speed.Starting from the pits alone brought me through D and C license then I started to learn more racecraft for the duration of my B license and some of my time in A class so that I could handle myself around other drivers so that I would feel confident in my ability to hold my A class license.,iRacing,cj9dpdr,2,t5_2s3h8

2773439,0,t1_cnisqgn,Not necessarily no.I wont post too long about this but in short Both too much and too little rebound damping will make that corner of the car unstable. So which direction to go depends on the range of adjustment the car has and what you start with. In my humble experience the SRF has little rear rebound damping to start with i.e. it is underdamped so you need to increase quite a few clicks to get critical damping.

3612596,0,t3_31oeh9,I guess you could say Ive made it to the top on the road side iRating  as Im currently competing in the World Championship series so heres how my career went.I subbed to iRacing back in  but I didnt take it seriously until about  where I worked my way up to the Indy Road series. Back then I didnt really care about iRating so I just raced for the fun but at the end of  I pushed to the A F series and became one of the charter members of Friction Racing. S was a learning season and  S I pushed for the pro series which I managed to sneak by and get. I was feeling pretty confident in myself when the  Pro series started but I was in for a reality check as I failed to qualify for the first  rounds which automatically put me out of the running for the WCPro license and series since when I did make the grid I was pretty much finishing dead last.  I took it as a learning experience even though it did hurt my pride to look so slow. S I took a break from F as my first child was born so I drove the Mclaren in the GT series with setups supplied from the forum. I took it as a challenge to drive the Mclaren as the RUF had just come out and the MP was nowhere near as quick.S I got my Pro license back and in the  Pro series I had a much better performance finishing th in the series and even managed a top  at VIR. Now Im FINALLY in the World Championship series and I think its going about as I would expect. Its another reality check qualifying rd th and not making the grid th for rounds  and  but its great to know that when I do make the grid that Im beating actually beating out other top sim racers in the world gunning to make those  grid slots. For the future I plan on spending a lot of my free time looking at issues in my driving so I can get further up the grid but with a nd child on the way I may just let go of competitive racing and drive something a bit more fun even though wanting to drive with the best is a bit like a herion addiction to me.

Sometimes you learn things from other cars that you can apply to other cars.For example the Skippy teaches weight transfer and keeping some throttle on while turning. And the Lotus  takes this concept to a higher skill level.Once you find a series you like try to run it every week and see how high up you can make it in the series standings.Make friends with people who are fast with you and are consistent. Higher splits and leagues with people you respect and challenge your skill make for some of the best racing you can get today.,iRacing,cssg7eq,3,t5_2s3h8

Changing one persons data will affect the entire community negatively and could possibly corrupt the system.gt gt We know it is frustrating to lose points and ratings this way but know that your best  of  weeks of races count towards your individual and club championships. Inevitably all simracers may have to deal with similar circumstances regardless of the cause and this is why we drop your worse four weeks throughout the season. My only issue is that I dont really care about series points. I just didnt like the loss or SR and iRating due to circumstances entirely out of my control.

The wheel does make a slight noise when changing direction rapidly but its not very loud. You cant hear it over the speakers at any decent volume.I am an electrician which helped me a lot with doing the wheel.

7704761,0,t3_4ku9fd,Just a few tips I have to give not that you did anything wrong. On the startrestarts start in second gear. Youll get up to speed quicker although if you did that in this example you might have been wiped out in that first wreck haha. Looks like you were trying to launch yourself to the green flag giving yourself a big gap so you can jump the start. Idk if you meant to but this is generally frowned upon because its not competitive and can cause wrecks not to mention black flags if you pass someone on the inside before the startfinish line.. You need to focus on drafting at every moment at these types of tracks. Youll be soaring quick! Bump drafting does wonders if done with the right group. Then again you may have wrecked doing any of these given the nature of the racing going on. Your wreck avoidance skill is great tho!,iRacing,d3hzahm,2,t5_2s3h8

9195280,0,t1_d8gakz8,gt Im sure they do but you can see other simulators with just as good quality content if not better when it comes to handling and detail of the tracks that dont seem to need to sell them for such a fee.Yeah no. The level of detail on cars and tracks in iRacing is unparalleled to any other sim. If you watch the videos they sometimes publish on how they create a car or track its a world of difference to other sims. Theres no denying.gt  iRacing is the only service that offers close jump in racing This is true and prity much the main reason most people are prepared to pay what they do for i racingAgree. All other sims are deserted online. I saw a few hundred people online in AC once right after a big release. rFactor  is dead unless youre willing to put in the time to drive in leagues. Automobilista is even smaller.gtI think the biggest issue with iRacing is that no other developer so far has really been willing to step up to the plate with a ranked hosted multiplayer this lack of competition has allowed iRacing to keep changing the prices it does.This is literally the first time iRacing has UPPED their subscription fees. Tracks and cars were even more expensive in . Thry do not keep changing their prices and from all your comments I get the sense you have no real grasp on what is needed to maintain such a big infrastructure.iRacing is only profitable since  or  years or so all the other years were paid for ny John Henry. We as simracers have to accept the market isnt bigger than this. We should be glad iRacing stepped up and made public matchmaking league racing and online championships as easy as they are right now.Without iRacing I would probably not be simracing at all because I cant be arsed to put in all the time and effort to joinadminister a league.

9681429,0,t3_5dq0l5,I think the best starting point no matter what form of road racing you like open wheel or otherwise the Skippy and mazda cup are the best cars to begin the path.  Skippy is probably a better candidate than the Mazda cup car if youd like to start with open wheel strictly.  Both are great learning platforms.  Then you can move on to probably the Formula Mazda or Renault.  The renault and star mazda perform similarly but have different aero and handling but act as the mid level for open wheel road racing.I dont think Id say that either of the classic lotus cars are really on the open wheel pathway but are insanely fun and present their own unique challenges that dont really compare to say the mp.  This point primarily applies to the lotus  since the  is really reliant on its aero and downforce in certain situations whereas the  has no downforce reliance. Simply put I think the path is SkippygtFR. or Star MazdagtPerhaps the DWgtMP.  It differs dependent on some oval tracks in the Star Mazda and indy car schedules.

And you can treat it as a challenge.For example I started practicing for the Blancpain Endurance WC qualifier in Zolder this week. I have been away from iRacing for the past  years or so and never raced in the track before. What I did? Full tank with the BSS set for Silverstone and I emptied that tank in  or so laps. Without crashing. Getting a little bit faster every lap. Of course I wanted to try to go as fast as I could but the challenge I commited to was to learn the track and finish that fuel tank driving safe but faster every lap. After that  laps I was still .s off the pace from the top guys but I already had a clue.

10313334,0,t3_5nocba,I am on the same boat right now bud. In my last something races I have yet to finish in the top  more than once. It all comes with consistency and how often you are out there actually racing. If you are like me and dont get much time on the track until you find yourself with an hour of spare time then the only practice you get is the practice session before the race and maybe a YouTube video real quick to see the track layout and braking points and hope that you can memorize them by the time your qual run starts. What Ive realized is that if youre not out there constantly putting laps in you are not going to be as consistent. Another thing is dont worry about trying to keep up with the guys ahead of you or try to keep those other guys behind you just race your line and worry about you. I was so worried about being fast that I tried to pace myself off the guys in front of me and I just always ended up spinning out or running into a wall or crashing into someone because I had a lapse of concentration and missed a braking point and ran into a guy. Shit happens in the past two months Ive lost my oval A and Road C licenses and have gotten them both back within a week. So I just ask myself how come I can manage to race clean and stay on track when Im attempting to get my license back? I dont know  but thats the one thing I always end up saying to myself when I wreck out in Every. Single. Race... trust me bud youre not the only one on hard times.

Its worth researching since you might find you can do half a series of SRF as well as a full series of skips.My main advice though is to stick to the smaller cars that reward precise control and gentle inputs.

11002397,0,t1_deeq31f,I have a  and can play very comfortably. The default render scale is .x IIRC which was a bit much on the first track I tried the Rift on so I would had to turn of a lot of details to keep it completely stable. I instead reduced the render scale to .x or so could be a bit more and its all good. The .x default comes from a time when iRacing had no AA in VR for me .x looks perfectly fine even though I am normally very fixated on having perfect AA. ,iRacing,def38i5,1,t5_2s3h8

Setting it up against the wall down the straights turn down into the corner.. you want a smooth line so that youre able to drive very close to the inside wall midway between  and  and hold it there until you have a smooth transition onto the straights.Watch the track conditions when trying to run the bottom it helps to stay out of the black slick on entry as it can slide you out of your line.

If youre talking about total accumulated points for your career Im not sure. Im guessing they would stack however. Divisions are made based on your iRating at the start of every season. They go from division  to Rookie. Each division has its own championship and winner. There is also an overall championship where the person with the most points irrespective of division wins. ,iRacing,dgbjxp1,2,t5_2s3h8
