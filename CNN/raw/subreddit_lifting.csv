542634,0,t3_20by1g,SS  GOMADHaha nah just kidding. Unless your goal is to be strongfat. Make sure you focus on the nonlifting aspects sleep eating enough and taking rest days. What are your goals? Become a shredded sick cunt? Get toned for Kyles pool party? Total over  pounds in the Big  lifts? ,lifting,cg1ycjt,1,t5_2rppf
1029441,0,t1_chkikar,I ran for months and months x a week and when I switched to just lifting I saw way more progress in the shape of my body in a good way in  weeks than I had in the months of running. Now I run infrequently and primarily for heart health. But yeah Ive burned lots more fat with lifting! PS. Im a girl,lifting,chlax5o,2,t5_2rppf

1534920,0,t1_cj8aiua,Yes it is a drug. Just like your multivitamin or Tylenol. With any of these drugs youre introducing higher levels of a chemical your body sometimes already produces but that your body doesnt normally maintain. ,lifting,cj8of9k,5,t5_2rppf

3670314,0,t3_32dof5,Just run and eat more food. I know you want to bulk up and youre right running burns calories. However dont miss out on something you enjoy just because of that! ,lifting,cqan1u1,3,t5_2rppf
4122455,0,t3_37ua3y,Well firstly you dont necessarily need to be sore after a good workout. But I would recommend trying to change up your rep scheme every once and a while. Try some high volume workouts and I assure you that you will be sore the next day.,lifting,crq6nrq,1,t5_2rppf

4732761,0,t1_ctqcqxr,I can easily make it work that way.   It used to work like that but the people I lift with  liked it better this way.   Ill update it when I get some time and Ill take that ad off too. ,lifting,ctr3ujw,1,t5_2rppf

11467569,0,t3_63mofl,I recognize that there are so much conflicting information out about deadlift so I may or may not be right. This is my interpretation.You are arching your lower back to a point where you can damage your back. You dont want that. Youre young so your body forgives you mine would not.This is a sumo deadlift as I see it. Im doing regular deadlifts but Id say the same applies.I alwaysPush in your chin thatll give you a good posture in almost any excersize as your body aligns into natural position  e.g. ready for lifting. Tighten your core and lean forward. Only have a natural arch.Again thats how I see it. You can find  people who says Im right and  people who says Im wrong.EditAlso you do a uck move almost at the top of the lift thrusting your hips forward use your butt muscle.. non native english dude. Im not sure if you didnt get to that because you dropped it.Also as said below you grip alternating.Also maybe put on lower weight and let your grip get stronger.,lifting,dfvucg9,3,t5_2rppf
11476522,0,t3_63mofl,Double overhand as much as possible. Chalk straps in that order. Personally not a fan or user of alternate grips. ,lifting,dfwuyal,1,t5_2rppf
