1438901,0,t3_2adk26,Better late than never This weeks theme obviously was about expectations vs. reality. It shines through most clearly in Daniels talk with Peggy about wonder and disappointment. Peggys comment that we cant live in a constant state of wonder is very season  but it also strikes me as a bit of metacommentary on how the character of Daniel has changed since the coma. He certainly was in a constant state of wonder in that cold open though. Other variations on the theme Amantha deciding to settle in Paulie for awhile longer and temporarily giving up her dream of moving back to ATL with Stern. Daniel imagining then actually living the idea of going up to Kerwins house and meeting his mom. Daniels meeting with Mr. and Mrs. Instagram in the diner I loved Daniels dont delete the photo! when he hurt their feefees. And Teddy confessing the Coffee Incident to Sheriff Carl during which we definitively learn exactly how far he thinks Daniel went while he was blacked out. About as far as it looked it turns out like sand on the beach indeed. I really did love that montage at the beginning of the episode. Donalds staredown with the man in the gorilla suit was hilarious and reminded me of a similar scene in the  John Huston film Wise Blood adapted from the Flannery OConnor novel. In the film a major character thinks the costumed man hes seeing is a real gorilla until he gets up close and realizes that the reality doesnt quite match up with his expectations. Eh? Eh? Do you want me to start talking like you Teddy? Great line great delivery from Clemens. And it cuts right to the heart of how Teddy wants the world around him to bend to his will instead of the other way around. More than anything I think thats why Daniels enigmatic nature scares him so much. Daniels a variable Teddy just cant control. And maybe hes starting to realize he cant control Tawney so easily either. This week on Asshole Watch Teddy gets drunk and steamrolls his wife and his friend paying no attention to anything theyre saying. Yeah his tire rental venture is doomed isnt it? Ted Sr. knows it the loan officer knows it and even his colleague knows it. Finally a tip of the hat to whomever did the score in the scene where Daniel rips up the kitchen I talked about the significance of Daniel trying to fix up everyones houses last week so I wont go there again. That ambient noisy controlled chaos sounded like Jonny Greenwoods work on PT Andersons latest films or Brian Reitzells on NBCs Hannibal. While were at it a round of applause for the music in this episode all around. That opening song was Chris Montez  single The More I See You. Tobias Wolffs short story Bullet in the Brain is a great quick read. Heres a pdf if youre interested. And yes its pretty morbid.,rectify,ciwn5ff,6,t5_2x074
1569059,0,t3_2c88yc,I see the show as more of a character piece. gtClearly were meant to not believe Daniel is guiltyI wouldnt quite say that. I think its been intentionally vague. They portray Daniel in a way that makes you think that he probably didnt do it but then occasional things will happen that make you question that theory. I think theyve been doing a great job of not leading you to a conclusion either way. gtBut the whodunnit element has been such a slow burn that its easy to forget that theres a murder to be solved.And thats okay with me. No its not a murder mystery. This is not The Killing. Character progression trumps plot progression. gtTV is a pretty brutal business and good shows dont get renewed all the time.True but Sundance is in the very early stages of growing their original shows. Nobody really watched Mad Men when it began on AMC but the critics adored it. Similarly critics are hailing Rectify as one of the years best shows. Sundance knows that its a great show and that while the ratings arent incredibly strong right now they very well may grow as more people become aware of the network. Having some Emmy noms certainly would have helped  quite a bummer that they didnt pick any up. ,rectify,cjcye04,9,t5_2x074
4790462,0,t1_cttj53d,Ted has been my favorite character from the start. Maybe because I feel closest to him. I just understand him. Hes the one guy trying to lok out for everyone and they just cast him aside but he still has their best interest in mind. And you know deep down he is a good man. He struggles but he does whats right in the end. He does some bad things but you cant blame him for lashing out. Teddy is just so easy to relate to for a lot of people Im sure.The actor who plays him is doing an outstanding job. ,rectify,ctydkoc,2,t5_2x074
