9937360,0,t1_db2ui65,Yeah I definitely agree there should probably be an option for longer matches.  Say in the custom server entry where you can invite people who dont obviously throw games.  People you know play the game correctly.  I can understand some people just not knowing what to do with their role if theyre new.  But earlier I was a wolf  matches in a row on Reapers stream and both times this Tduffy dude was a villager may have been a gossip the first time I cant remember but had no reason to lie.  He threw the game for all the villagers and wouldnt leave since it was his lobby since he created it and we couldnt vote kick him due to that.   Always starts out every match with Hey Im a new guy even if its the same group of people every round and literally will lie as a villager.  People like that would flourish in longer games and Im not going to continue playing if more people like that start trickling in.  Thats not even playing the game thats just making a lobby and trolling everyone who wants to actually play.  ,WerewolvesWithin,db2v397,2,t5_3d7si
10025704,0,t1_dbdrcaq,Got to say Id also leave the group if it was populated by people pulling the read what it says in your book play. Regardless of the ethical discussion it just sucks the fun out for me. It takes me away from the immersive role play element and zooms me right back into the real world. ,WerewolvesWithin,dbedkx7,3,t5_3d7si
10032503,0,t1_dbedkx7,Agreed.I was asked to read from my book when I really was what I claimed but I refused to read it. Got me killed though irrc. haha D,WerewolvesWithin,dbf9foq,1,t5_3d7si
10070247,0,t1_dbjl2k8,Honestly a lot of this games appeal is the great interactions between the players. It would suck to be the mute and be cut off from everyone.,WerewolvesWithin,dbk6c6a,3,t5_3d7si

10444682,0,t3_5pkz21,Not that it makes it any more right but thats online gaming in general. Youre bound to run into stuff like that all the time if youre talking to strangers online.,WerewolvesWithin,dcrzlil,1,t5_3d7si

11373859,0,t1_dfk2jk9,I can confirm they probably see it as a strategy. A long time ago I played roblox with my friends over skype and we played some game where your given roles. One is the murderer one is the police and the rest are villagers. Id always say over voice chat comeon villager again! To my friends so that if I was the murderer by doing the same response for everything they wouldnt realize there was any difference.Looking back it was pretty stupid and now I would find it very annoying. Honestly the best thing to do if that happens with someone again is to just ask them politely to stop and if they dont you can always try to kick them.Anyways thanks for the response!,WerewolvesWithin,dfl7g5h,1,t5_3d7si
