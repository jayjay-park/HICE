6994750,0,t3_4bhsl9,I am reading this very interesting book Healing the Shame that Binds You by John Bradshaw and I believe a lot of the struggle that led me to sissyhypnos among other things... by far not the worst thing that happened to me  and that led my first girlfriend a transexual who was misunderstood and cast out by her family to a life of addiction and prostitution that took years to heal is that we experience and internalize toxic shame.The book is worth reading the video worth seeing if you are ready to work on yourself to understand who you are and accept it.,sissyology,d1974og,1,t5_3d635

Feminization alone is a pretty innocent fetish and you are probably getting too worked up over this. Just think about what you would think if your girlfriend did the opposite. Let say she wants to wear a leather jacket while you have sex. Would you really care that much?,sissyology,d7osmzb,2,t5_3d635
