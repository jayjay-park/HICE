Its a bit pricey but totally worth it easily superior to Chipotle any day of the week. Ive heard a lot of people have had hit or miss experience with five guys. Ive never had a bad experience. Make sure to order their Bacon Cheese burger. Fries are hit or miss you might like them or not. Speaking of burgers InnOut is always good just make sure to ask for Animal Style on your burger and fries. If you like extra cheese and meat on your burgers ask for a  by  animal style.  beef patties  slices of cheese grilled chopped onions basically everything that makes the franchise good.  Steak n Shake is nice but nothing that stands out for me imo. Apparently Jack in the Box is also west coast. Only thing I would really recommend getting is the late night munchiesFor  bucks you get half curly frieshalf regular fries  tacos a choice of one of their late night box entrees and a drink.
