Not taking into account the cost of the crew and provisions for the trip to Pentos not to mention funds for a least a portion of his stay there. So this portion will need to be reworked.

He was the first mod Bran hired after he gained the reins of this sub and has done a load for the sub in the past.  He has helped us in times when we needed it most even if he hardly had the time to and continues to do so including right now.I hope this answers some questions on that. ,ITRPCommunity,d4mtluw,6,t5_345o6

10262388,0,t1_dc76skn,Just to note Ive read the whole thing and I really do appreciate the feedback. We really do and thanks to this comment and the others its come to light that the mod team hasnt been up to par we thought we were but were obviously not.But I do want to make a specific commentgtThat conversation ended with a mod saying lets play another round of the criticize everything we do gameThe conversation was waaaay over before I made that comment. I made that comment maybe...  minutes after it ended? The whole thing was a little conversation that one side was being a bit harsher than they needed to saying something along the lines of well if that name is what. I wont go into specifics about the conversation or its participants at all but here youre twisting it as if I halted the conversation with saying Dont criticize us when in fact I did not end the conversation. The conversation was over for  or so minutes. It was an offhanded comment about the conversation. And I was also warned by other mods after the fact as well about it.Miscommunication has plagued this sub since day . The above example is one of many examples of miscommunication. Youre making it seem like I a mod told a member to stop criticizing our decisions and stopped a conversation when in fact that is not true. And the instance of a member of a mod team harassing a player was handled. They have been warned told to watch how they communicate with the members. Our issue with people not coming to us is not directed to you. You come to us with everything and thats not a bad thing. You give us specifics on what we have done to make you feel whichever way. And even though your messages are so long and take ages to read and longer to reply to its still good to receive feedback negative or not.But there are other people that seemingly overnight turned their opinion completely around about us out of the blue. Some people that have modmailed us once or twice in the past and weve had nothing but good interactions with. Suddenly just over the past two days or so it comes to light that  or  or however many players dont trust the mod team? We had absolutely no idea this feeling of distrust was lingering about. This hit us out of leftfield.We recognize the fact that players are unhappy with how some decisions are made with how some rolls are done with how some mods communicate and all of that will change. Hence the survey. Contrary to popular belief mods dont want to drive players out or rule with an iron fist or puff our chests out and look down upon the players from our dais. No. Moderators are here to guide the players and assist those who need help.  It is obvious that at the moment some members are unhappy with our services and believe that we havent done a good job of guiding and assisting. Were going to improve on that and it wont happen overnight but it will happen. This survey is the beginning of that improvement.On the other end the members need to allow the mods time to improve after receiving the feedback comments and criticism weve received and are going to receive over and throughout the next couple of days. Yes there is a general feeling of distrust from those who have voiced such but now that this feeling has been aired and weve been made aware of it we have to improve ourselves. Improving ourselves is one step the members allowing us to improve ourselves is the next step. Over the next few weeks were going to take these survey answers and implement changes based off of them. Hopefully these changes will allow us to win over what trust weve lost. But in order for us to regain that trust the members have to be willing to look past our mistakes and give the mods a chance to do so. I hope thats at least semicohesive lol. And I think this can serve as a response to everyone that has replied so far. ,ITRPCommunity,dc7aq10,4,t5_345o6
