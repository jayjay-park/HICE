6767074,0,t3_48eqhw,In short not at the moment.We have a lot of content about the game and from those who make it but the bulk of the actual gameplay we have is from the gameplay trailer and from short gameplay clips they made for people of their best play of the match on twitter. You can check these out if you keep scrolling down hereAs time goes on we can expect some more. With any luck they may be at PAX East and well get more footage from that at the end of April.,lawbreakers,d0jbt1i,2,t5_32zqf

8441362,0,t3_4v8xdv,It doesnt run any better for me. I gave up on playing it. Just remember its still in Alpha.,lawbreakers,d5wpjcn,1,t5_32zqf
8464659,0,t1_d5y22no,That would be how the game is supposed to be. I am fed up with arbitrary limitations that are imposed to cater to the lowest denominator and be manageable for people who should not play these games anyway just to make a few more bucks. Assassins would be too mobile? No just means everybody else is too slow poorly designed. ,lawbreakers,d5zmazh,1,t5_32zqf

10498854,0,t3_5q7lbn,I played the alpha and did not have a good time with it. Wasnt a fan of the battery capture game mode and the assassin chick was OP and that is all anyone ever played. Ive never been a fan of melee kits in a shooter and never gave her a shot so it was very hard to learn the game when you just died  second into combat starting.Ill still get the game because I believe in Cliffy B and have met a few of the guys from BossKey at E but lasting appeal for me doesnt seem very long until the beta comes around soon.,lawbreakers,dcy5m7r,1,t5_32zqf

11516953,0,t3_64aoog,I played champions and its pretty fucking good. That being said Lawbreakers is no Quake Champions and Vise Versa.So yea. It will be back. The beta is an OpenClose thing where they patch every time they close it for a week.,lawbreakers,dg1g55p,1,t5_32zqf
