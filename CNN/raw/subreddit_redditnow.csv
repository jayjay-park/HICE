662328,0,t1_cgfjxtd,Sure I must admit I never thought of that use case. Does all not return saved posts from unsubscribed subreddits? Ill test later but if it doesnt Ill likely add a type subreddit to filter by option.Thanks,redditnow,cgfk1gx,2,t5_2vklg
724177,0,t1_cgmi6u4,Due to the app using a GridView its not very easy to simply add in a list view option. It can be done but Ill probably wait until Ive released a couple more updates and most of the bugsfeature requests are out of the way.I will eventually get around to adding more view options though as Ive had several similar requests.,redditnow,cgmlbyy,3,t5_2vklg

1245161,0,t1_ci9oy8o,Yes Ill probably redo the read indicator when I get a spare moment. Fading the card seems like the nicest method of indicating a post has been read.,redditnow,ci9p2nz,2,t5_2vklg

2514249,0,t3_28mlzl,Is there any way to add a list view like reddit sync? Its much more compact which is really convenient,redditnow,cmmr1c1,1,t5_2vklg
2949073,0,t1_co34wya,Lets just say certain subreddits have very loyal fans of another particular app. Its not an issue though as Reddit Now has a larger user base they just dont frequent techy subreddits and vote on their favorite reddit app ,redditnow,co3bnu1,2,t5_2vklg
3767607,0,t1_cqjotrx,Thanks for the update! The new long press feature is magical! I love it!,redditnow,cqlqh1h,1,t5_2vklg
3792978,0,t1_cqoirgo,I made a small change to the looping behaviour in the recent update which may have broken looping for you device. I dont have an S to test with but Ill revert it in the next update which is due out very soon.,redditnow,cqomolv,2,t5_2vklg
4233924,0,t1_cs2rtm6,I can add scrolling to the top of the collapsed comment if that helps? Usually scrolling up a little until you see the collapsed comment isnt too much of an issue though?My only concern is users may not like their comments moving automatically to the parent comment each time theyre collapsed.I guess its down to personal opinion so would probably be better as an option to enable or disable in the settings.,redditnow,cs2usrw,2,t5_2vklg

9675972,0,t1_da5itp9,Yes this screen uses the same layout so it will have the problem too. Im now fixing the problem and should have an update soon.Out of interest what did your status bar look like in the last version when it didnt have this problem? Was it Black Grey same color as action bar Grey same color as action bar with the slight gradient you see in the latest version Im guessing it is this one but I wanted to be sure. Thanks.,redditnow,da5rlxk,2,t5_2vklg

11275240,0,t3_60tt67,I think that youre doing an awesome job! Keep it up uMiloco!Also like others have suggested being able to switch between bottom and slide out navigation would be awesome. But I definitely understand that its best to only maintain a single form. In that regard Ill also vouch for keeping the current form. But its difficult to say without trying the other form for a bit. ,redditnow,dfa15z9,2,t5_2vklg
