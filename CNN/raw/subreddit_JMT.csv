11178266,0,t1_dey8w46,I second the trail runners suggestion for the reasons the person above me outlined. I went with boots heavyish ones mind you on my section hike and the day after I did Whitney and in total  miles that day my feet were cut up bad and for a week thereafter. Best wishes on your hike!! ,JMT,dez1ldp,2,t5_2vt9y

11724068,0,t3_67afir,You will be experiencing a lot of snow.  Take proper equipment and it will be a lot safer.  You can probably get by with microspikes and trekking poles but I would personally feel much more comfortable over the passes if I had an ice axe and crampons.  It depends on how much the trail will be packed out by then.Getting a NOBO permit out of Cottonwood Pass or Cottonwood Lakes may still be possible.  Go check on the Inyo NF site.,JMT,dgoybyp,2,t5_2vt9y
11740723,0,t1_dgqtomd,I read somewhere that as of  that food caches are removed  by the forest service if left for more than  days or something like that. Not too sure though because I cant find where I read that.,JMT,dgqua3b,2,t5_2vt9y
