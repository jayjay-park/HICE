1162715,0,t3_26q29v,Well some of them are just variations on the same word strok stroka strokan kyld kyling kylingur etc. some are endocentric compound words slgul slvindur etc. and some are both of the above kvldargul kvldgul slargul slgul.If you remove the contrived words the list gets somewhat shorter.I mean if you count every possible version of a word and all compound versions then the list would probably number in the tens of thousands. It is like the saying that there are many words for snow in Greenlandic  polysynthetic languages tend to have many words for a lot of things. I am not comparing Greenlandic to Faroese but it is the same kind of problem.,FaroeIslands,ci0farw,2,t5_2sx9p

3012848,0,t3_2qtlmw,Im looking to go! I was hoping to bring my camper but it seems hard and pricey. So flights maybe but once again its hard to tell which way to go. Im in London and the current plan is to fly via Copenhagen but Im not sure if that will be the cheapest way.I want to do some climbing while Im there maybe be there for a week or two. That reminds me I have to get into contact with uHitno! ,FaroeIslands,coaa31m,1,t5_2sx9p
3249136,0,t1_coyribh,I just quickly checked the tickets for the dates you mentioned.    march Copenhagen  Faroe Islands  Copenhagen has a price of around  euros for one person.    march Copenhagen  Faroe Islands  Copenhagen has a price around  euros per person.So it is absolutely not cheap.However if you have a lot of time on your hands you could look into taking the cruise that leaves from Amsterdam. I dont know the exact prices at the moment or if there is anything available at the moment. But if you did this you would have transport food and accommodation for the stay.,FaroeIslands,coys52s,1,t5_2sx9p

6312823,0,t3_4222f3,Camping in the wild is illegal without landowners approval.Nightlife is decent enough I guess havent utilized it for several years however. This is a nordic country expect the prices to be higher than wherever you are from.Best places to check out in terms of nature? hmm all over the place Id say you can drive to a lot of really nice spots but hiking brings you to the good places.Also late march can be hellish weather wise so bear that in mind.,FaroeIslands,cz774no,1,t5_2sx9p

8381833,0,t3_4tk3ic,I would say that most between the ages of  and  speak English conversational. Most of my generation I am in my earlymid s speak English well enough to go and have a decent conversation with a native English speaker. Id say that if you meet someone whom you estimate to be  assume they speak little to no English. Of course there are exceptions as it all depends on who taught them English in School and how much theyve used that knowledge.Most below   may not be as fluent in terms of vocabulary and at producing sentences but they will be able to point you into the right direction.,FaroeIslands,d5p9zxb,2,t5_2sx9p
