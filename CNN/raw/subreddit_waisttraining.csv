7881141,0,t3_4mcwal,Hi there!For lasting results I definitely recommend that you invest in a steel boned corset that is made specifically for waist training.While elastic waist cinchers  are designed to make people sweat and lost water weight steel boned corsets are created to be breathable while forcing your body into the shape of the garment. I have never personally tried the elastic cinchers but I have heard that they can restrict breathing. on the contrary a well made corset should leave room for your ribs to expand and contract while only applying pressure to the waist.You may want to ask your doctor about beginning waist training during your HRT if you are feeling unsure at all about its safety. I have seen videos posted by women who incorporated waist training during their transitions but do not have any helpful firsthand experience about combining the two.I have always been a very straightupanddown person without any curves and waist training has really changed my shape to be more classically feminine.If you choose to use corsets make sure to take your time! change will happen dont try to rush your body. Also I definitely recommend sticking with underbusts as they will allow you much more freedom of movement.If you have any specific questions I would love to do my best to help. I wish that this thread would liven up a little too. Good luck!! ,waisttraining,d41wwln,2,t5_2xlrb
