We will do our best to make the price as low as possible How to make any controller work?gtHello we are adding official support for more controllers but you should be able to get that one working with this guideI hope that helps Ian The status of client releases currentlygtWell the next update for android i think will be full release. Pc client will be released to more people but will remain a beta thats what i know maybe some more things but i dont know for sure. Will there be lines to get into computers after release like in the beta?gtIt isnt likely that we will be able to perfectly match the number of servers with demand at all times. Once we start charging we will aggressively expand the number of servers to keep pace with demand but its still possiblelikely that there will be times when too many people are trying to get on relative to resources.

7623761,0,t3_4jqsyu,Idk how customizable could be the service I think is not that simple to allocate an specific amount of computing resources its more likely that they have presets of servers and you migrate your instance from one to another.I would love to see something that customizable like a calculator of creditshour for your specific config and the pool of credits being a float precission number xD. But I dont think that many people are as freak as me not only to prefer that option but also understand it. From the marketing point of view is also a mess not to speak of the technical complications for the developer team.But I have to say that a low specs config  cpu shitty or integrated gpu would be a nice option for decongestion of datacenters. So you can use it while you are browsing or downloadinginstalling a game. Cost less credits and you are not hoarding resources that you are not using.,LiquidSky,d38s4m2,1,t5_329hf

8285930,0,t1_d5d862w,There have sadly been many cases of Android letting down people when it comes to privacy. Quite recently a certain Pokemon game game the developers of that game FULL access to every users Google account. And by full access I literally mean full access. Now that was apparently an error on the developers side and Google stepped in to stop it. As for the RIAA they monitor torrent sites and watch for IP addresses connecting up on their fake torrents. They then quickly contact the ISP concerned and state the following Ips are downloading torrents etc. The ISP then sends out a cease and desist letter. Three strikes and you loose your net connection with that company for up to a year. Google mail Gmail Hotmail scan your email and direct advertising  towards you in relation to what they find in your email. Ever used Facebook and wondered why the advertising is showing you something similar to a restaurant you were at only a day or two ago? That is because Facebook is using location tracking and sending you commercials based on your lactations. Of course the majority of times you can switch a lot of this off that is until the companies concerned change the rules without informing the end user and switch it all back on again.Windows  I am sure I dont have to talk about the privacy violations in that piece of software lol.What I am trying to say is we are all being monitored  and privacy something I cherish is sadly becoming a thing of the past.So I believe Liquid Sky is doing what it has to do in order to keep the service going. Its a case of if you want to do something shall we say a little shady then you need to do it outside of Liquid Sky.,LiquidSky,d5dat5k,1,t5_329hf

8850785,1,t3_51f4mc,Just my . .... We dont know the cost for providing LSs service or the cost for CPA to get new users. But each paying customer is not just your competition  youre depending on them to pay for a LOT of other warm bodies crowding the server. LS has to get a critical mass of subscribers or the whole platform will crash and burn.. We can expect a WIDE swath of folks gaming the system with multiple trials or running really lean accounts without reupping on minutes. The business model LS is chasing depends on significantly regular residual income from a base that supports their operations.. There is a finite number of servers and sessions that the company can afford to bring online while theyre in the purgatory that is their BETA. I get that I have the luxury of connecting roughly  of the time southwest US on High or Ultra machines but the value I get from the machine is demonstrated in the hours Im paying for already.Disclaimer Im on the Gamer    monthly plan and would be more mad if I was paying x as much without getting access. I would definitely change my location server at that point and would try to deal with the increased latency.  But expect them to be overprovisioned for the indeterminate future and understand you are buying the service theyre offering today in hopes youre funding future expansion. You are not buying a promised pieintheskytomorrow.Its like Steam Early Access. Dont expect any more than what youre youre paying for today. ,LiquidSky,d7bqlxu,1,t5_329hf

9000616,0,t1_d7tngye,x would be x the high plan. This all depends on what kind of deals we work out with AMD and NVIDIA. We are still talking with them under NDA about custom licensing so I unfortunately dont have much to report. Ian,LiquidSky,d7tqgbn,1,t5_329hf

9247774,0,t3_56ll0c,Well I asked them that same question a while back. As I was toldThere is no possibility of skipping our trial. We want to make sure your LiquidSky experience is a great one before you spend any of your hard earned money. There are still some devices out there on which LiquidSky doesnt provide the best experience possible. You may also be too far from one of our data centers. That is why we want you to test our application before you decide to purchase a plan.So thats the main reason they wont allow new people to skip trial.,LiquidSky,d8o81vf,1,t5_329hf

However when I look at my credit card transaction I see that I was charged the correct amount of ..Im assuming its just a bug on the website but I hope it gets fixed for future payments.Btw our early adopter pricing of . is supposed to be grandfathered ,LiquidSky,d9uhl4y,1,t5_329hf

10486306,0,t1_dcwfq2r,Yes and I think youre misunderstanding that youre not supposed to play without sky credits. You did because there was a glitch in the system its not supposed to happen and it likely wont happen again. As its already been mentioned there was an issue the passed week or so.If you want to continue usage youd have to buy more credits.,LiquidSky,dcwqd2k,2,t5_329hf

10988259,0,t1_ded1ezo,Not that I speak on behalf of liquidsky or affiliated with them but lets be honest. Even with a few surveys or whatever these adsupported services nowadays are dishing out. Theyre getting access to a gaming pc! Its not like a very dumbed down gaming mobile app. This is a virtualized pc!I still stand by my opinion that the adsupported version of LS is aimed at people whod like to test the service and then opt into a monthly plan. Like an extended trial... but thats just my opinion ,LiquidSky,dedhg5n,1,t5_329hf
11141735,0,t1_detk49w,Oh thats too bad.  credits onetime  this is absolute nothing. New plans for Liquidsky are twice as expensive than previous. And  day credits lifetime.,LiquidSky,deuwkjx,0,t5_329hf
