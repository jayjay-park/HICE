3052449,0,t1_coedjws,I am letting them have their own contest its just that Saber fans should vote for Saber. To clarify i meant people who readplayed the the FateStay Night visual novel should vote for her on this sub and i wanted to inform people who didnt know about this contest and give them heads up.,Saber,coedujf,3,t5_32ud3
3266640,0,t1_cp0kuwq,Wow thanks for the awesome reply! And sorry but writing my own post brought back feels for me too. But thats good because it can facilitate good discussion!In response to your Fate route analysis I agree. As I said in my own post Sabers done very well and of course she gets the most development here too. I mainly wanted to change Shirou not only so that we could see some epicness from him aside from him projecting stuff at the last possible second in the Berserker fight and Gilgamesh fight at the bridge but so that he would be a little more... worthy I suppose. Not to say he didnt try his best or to downplay what he did accomplish I just wish we couldve seen him pull something off like he did against Kuzuki in UBW Just imagine if he had a moment like this and got Saber an opening against Gilgamesh so that she wouldnt have been slapped by Ea! He just seemed to talk a lot about how he wanted to protect her and then get the snot beat out of him promptly afterwards. I wanted him to prove his worth better than he did in this route.In response to your UBW route analysis Great point about the Good Ending. Ill be honest I didnt like it too much. While I was glad that she doesnt just disappear it also seemed kind of... halfassed? Or disingenuous? Not sure what the proper word is but its as if he cant choose between the two girls. I like Saber more than Rin but to be fair its the latters route. But your perspective is a valid one too about how she wants to stay guide him and protect him. Thats definitely our Saber!In response to your HF route analysis I see your point about how killing her is like doing her a favor since she wasnt herself like the comparison you made to Lancelot. Maybe its just me but I felt like part of her was still there. She was proud of Shirou for besting her based on the things she said in the bad end Sparks Liner High and still cared for him  when you choose not to kill her she says something along the lines of I have never cursed anyone more than you. I interpreted that as her being aware of what shes become it would have been nice if that choice allowed you to somehow get to her and help her break free of the shadow. Id be fine with him killing her as well  what Im saying is make it so that EITHER choices are still valid. Maybe by freeing herself she uses a crapton of mana and can only stick around for a little while longer and manages to help a bit and part with Shirou before disappearing. As it is both her life and her ending are tragic she gets absolutely no resolution wouldnt you agree? I know the theme of this route is that you truly cannot save everyone but Id personally like that to apply more to the townspeople that died and Shirou and co. living to atone for it since in the end every one of the main cast Shirou Sakura Rin even Rider gets a happy end. Id consider Illyas happy because she is able to do what she wishes  save her younger brother.,Saber,cp0mgjp,2,t5_32ud3

6971391,0,t1_d157ci1,Im with Psy on this one. Definitely not possible in the sense that you wrote it in buuuuuuuuut if you were to add the possibilities of encountering alternate universeesque characters in some sort of alteredmalfunctioned Holy Grail War then Id be totally cool with this idea.Mostly because lots of people bitch and complain that Saber is popular solely because shes a female and that if she were a he instead then people wouldnt be as interested in said character. I disagree If Nasu were to write the character in a similar manner to fit the story for Prototype Saber then I feel he would be a bad ass character with a justasoutstanding reputation. Although it would theoretically take away from the whole waifu thing... Maybe.,Saber,d16jm1p,1,t5_32ud3
