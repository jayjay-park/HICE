7096956,0,t3_4crkmw,Technique I found this little solitary bee feeding on a Dandelion and cast my shadow over it to see if I could get its metabolism to tank. In cool weather it was C small solitary bees need the heat of the sun to keep them going. The bee flew to a leaf and I continued to shadow it and after a minute of being motionless I moved in for a few photos. I couldnt get the angle I wanted for this portrait so I picked the leaf and braced my hand on a fence post to help keep the scene steady and so Id have some color in the background. Its a Mining Bee Andrena but not sure about the specific species.Tech Specs Canon D F  ISO   a Canon MPE mm macro lens around x  a diffused MTEX.
