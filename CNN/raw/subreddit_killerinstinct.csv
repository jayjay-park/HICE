4172841,0,t3_38kt2v, Youll have situations in which you both are low on health and you want to play safe. Maybe a shadow pyrobomb will be the best option. Also theres a juggle combo you can do with them. Use a fired up fireflash and when you land pop instinct. Start throwing pyrobombs above you and ignite them BEFORE they hit the ground use shadow ones to bring them back up higher NOTE THIS IS UNBREAKABLE AND DOES HELLA DAMAGE. I personally have not learnt it yet but one of the best Cinders in ranked has and I will be learning it soon. Im a pressure player. As soon as I get in close I will do everything possible to keep them locked in. One of the tricks I do is use third degree into a fakeout or a normal fission. Low ranked ppl usually drop their block right when the normal fission comes out and itll hit. NOTE When you use fission out of third degree there is a frame or two when the enemy can react with a DPdragon punch or a grab or anything that will stuff the move so be careful. Keep mixing it up and dont become stale and obvious. Manuals are a  must learn to make sure people have the hardest time breaking you. One thing you can do is third degree manuals. I personally do not use it too much bc I havent had the time to practice it trying to keep up in ranked for these  weeks for once. You can definitely use it for mix ups but I normally use one manual into another special. One thing you could do is manual third degree into the third heavy knock up to get a fancy juggle combo going. There are some instances where you can use third degree to keep a juggle combo going.  You can instinct cancel any movesas long as it connected with the opponent even if they blocked. Say I used a fired up fireflash and they blocked. As soon as I land and the nd hit comes out Ill instinct to repeat the fireflash hoping itll hit them or cancel it into third degree. One thing Ive been doing recently is when Im juggling someone using trailblazer and aerials Ill instinct if my Knockdown Value is red or full so I can give more damage.If you need more tips just lemme know ,killerinstinct,crvwt71,3,t5_2sqy5

5988594,0,t1_cy4lg7o,Only comment Ill make on this video is during the second match just before Flash takes your first lifebar I would have walked back and forth to pressure with windkick if he jumped. That way when he did jump you could take his first lifebar instead. If he had blocked just toss another fireball if he used the slide just heavy windkick into light laser sword. You could have taken the first lifebar relatively easily with a little bit of spacing in that match. All that being said damn good Jago.,killerinstinct,cy4mwjd,1,t5_2sqy5

6118927,0,t3_3zclgu,Some of the tips bellow I took from Gootecks from Cross Counter TV and Excelent Adventures fame.  Go to the Dojo mode. Its an assisted training mode where the game will teach you not only the basics about KI combo system and such but even basics about fighting games in general. Complete it and youll at least be familiarized with the tools in the game.  Since youre from D fighters background maybe doing special moves that require circle motions and button presses arent your specialty. If thats the case also reserve a few minutes a day to go to training mode and do some of the moves  times in a row without mistakes so that you can build the muscle memory to do them without missing during a match. Ignore that step if you can do special moves just fine.  If the combo system is too much for you at first turn on the Combo Assist mode. Read about it here   Its cool if you play a feel matches against the computer or friends with Hisako to have fun but she is not exactly easy to learn. Her moves arent that hard but she needs you to read your opponent like a book if you want to be successful with her.While youre learning the basics I strongly suggest you pick a character that represents the basic mechanics of the game and for KI this character is Jago. Hes the Ryu of this game and because of that he can fulfill almost any role you want with the exception of grappler of course.Dont worry though you dont need to play him for long. The objective is to learn the basics how to do special moves and combos and how to use them in a stressfull situation like an online ranked match. Once you can do moves control space be unpredictable specially during combos to avoid being combo broken and read your opponent so you can break his combos you can start to learn the character you like the most.  Play with friends. If you can its always good to learn together with a friend. On the early days without internet we played at home with friends for fun and went to arcades when we wanted to put our knowledge to the test. Nowadays playing with friends still exists but arcades have turned into online ranked mode and so youll probably get destroyed quite often. With the game being free on GwG its possible the matchmaking system will match you against other new players but even then its good to learn on a less hostile environment if you can.  Keep trying. KI is an awesome game and IMO one of the most balanced out there. Also its really friendly to new players due to dojo mode the new combo assist and an overal compromise in making very clear to a player whats happening so he doesnt think everything is random.Welcome to KI.,killerinstinct,cyl5py9,1,t5_2sqy5

But he did look and sound cool so that was enough to be desirable.I dont think Double Helix had any plans for him except to be a coollooking Jago. Once Iron Galaxy took over they finally decided to revamp him. They started by making him a secret boss in season  with new moves and an Ultimate finisher. The community was quite vocal about wanting him to be his own character and thats where the fundraiser came in.

7213581,0,t3_4e8vgl,. There are aerial characters in the game already Sadira and Cinder. Check them out.. Very loaded question. Shadow attacks cost one bar of meter but can have one or many benefits over regular versions speed partial or total invulnerability damage longer distance traveled and so on. Shadow Linkers extend combos by not filling up the KV meter so you can tack on extra damage and often corner carry. Enders shadow or otherwise cash out the potential damage that builds up while youre performing a combo and provide additional effects depending on type of ender used hard knockdown damage wall splat etc.. If you dont use an ender and let the KV meter fill up and the opponent fall out of your combo youre leaving a lot of damage on the table white life that your opponent can regenerate. Theres more but its hard to answer in a couple of sentences. Do some reading. Awesome. Last years KI World Cup Top  had literally every single character used in at least one match. At this moment were in a bit of a limbo after S changes and some characters being banned from tournaments due to exploits so its hard to say where we stand exactly but the game is very well balanced. As to what sets this apart from other fighters... well have you been playing the game at all?

His divekick move is extremely safe on block so when you block it  and see him jump back to land   thats your chance to strikeAs for his air game most people spam that spinning HP for cross ups. Id suggest go to practice mode and set the AI to mimic that and learn how to block it.

7257991,0,t3_4esqgi,As a relative newbie to the whole fighting game scene started with Street Fighter IV but never felt like I was getting anywhere I really do appreciate what Killer Instinct brings to the table for people like me. The way tutorials are structured and written are intuitive in the way they present their mechanics although character specific ones would be much appreciated. Especially since the character you are taught with is Jago the free character that just got rotated out with Maya.Best of all the game doesnt feel as degrading to a relative newcomer. Whereas SFIV arcade mode does a good job of punishing you at every turn on anything but the lowest difficulty I do love how KIs first couple of difficulties gives new players the ability to play a little sloppy while give just enough challenge to make me want to improve myself. Its nice to play a fighting game that doesnt immediately call you out for being garbage to the point where you have no joy until youve scaled the initial fighting game wall.,killerinstinct,d236k7m,2,t5_2sqy5

Trust me you dont want to be relying on wall crashes. Okay since you said smash.... let me give you a suggestion.If you want like.... No combos your best character is Tusk. I just mess around with him and I dont NEED to do any combos or combo enders to make quick progress. His damage output and range is absurd. Plus you win the neutral game against most characters. If you fight a high level tusk you aint going in. Nobody gets past his threatzones. Aganos has glaring weaknesses. Tusk may not be slower paced but he is reactionary and better at capitalizing the opponents mistakes. Hes not a grappler but its easy to open up opponents if your sword is mightier than a grab. Thunder is also a good grappler with insane damage output. I would not stick with Mira because she is not really a grappler even tho she has a command grab. She relies heavily on combos and you maximizing her punish game. Once again she has super damage output.,killerinstinct,d6vntd6,1,t5_2sqy5

Fantasy RPGs such as The Witcher can have subgenres such as racing card games gambling etc.Smash also has subgenrescrossover genres within the main game such as coop action platformer etc. And before you say it this doesnt make smash a PURE fighting game but it still counts based on the basic mechanics I talked about earlier.Saints Row is an Actionadventuresandbox game but you can also dance in the game. Dance is a game genre too so that would count as a subgenre within Saints Row as it is not a part of the coremain game but still exists within the game itself. Even with subgenres its still an action game you cant just say that it isnt because it has other untraditional elements to it as well.And yes if Dark Souls PvP was a standalone game it would undoubtedly be listed as a fightingbrawler game.So next argument or are you done this nonsense?,killerinstinct,d8to78x,1,t5_2sqy5

You can change which height of blocking youre doing at any time while youre being attacked but if you screw up a block you get punished easily. Learning to block well is one of the harder things a new player has to learn if they want to succeed,killerinstinct,ddisb5f,1,t5_2sqy5
10692619,0,t3_5syq25,i dont think theres a single best way just different methods.fulgore can teleport and his heavy eye laser goes through it i think. spinal can hold back LP to eat it for a skull and a bit of meter. shago can use his slide i think. he can enhance it with a double tap to teleport right behind the enemy i know that. thats all i can think of off the top of my head honestly. as a spinal player i giggle at people attempting fireball zoning. unless its glacius. the motherfucker loves when i try to power devour.,killerinstinct,ddiv522,3,t5_2sqy5

11075932,0,t3_5y5g58,Your own character has specific ow I just got hit and am reeling from it animations depending on the strength of the offensive players attacks and there are also sound ques to differentiate between lightmediumheavy hits but in general its better to learn the other characters animations although theres at least one blind guy who plays this game just using said sound ques so its certainly possible. In general its entirely possible to eyeball it even without knowledge of that character but some characters do their autodoubles fasterslower than others Aganos is probably the most standout and it can make it hard to differentiate between them. If youre having trouble correctly spotting the animations for a particular character hit up combo breaker training and set the opponent to that character.There are definitely situations where you wont want to attempt a combo breaker like if you think the other guy is going to counterbreak or if theyre theyre onpoint with their manuals manuals are much harder to break without guessing than autodoubles and it may just be better to take the risk that theyll keep their combo short if you havent locked out. Many characters also have linkers that do not follow the one hit  light two hits  medium and three hits  heavy convention so breaking their linkers without guessing is harder and not always worth the risk.,killerinstinct,deng3ji,3,t5_2sqy5

But the game is certainly far from dead. If I read correctly on some other threads it might be an issue with idk how to spell it toredo. It has something to do with connecting you to matches.
