11696745,0,t3_663d10,The content is interesting!I would recommend your home page not be a long page with the full length of all your posts. I would include a snippet of each post and put a Read More button.Second I would make your social media and the home page to contact part bigger. I feel like its a little small. Same thing with your blog name.You have really good interaction on your blog so keep up the good work!,BloggersHelp,dgluesx,2,t5_3i844
