4998382,0,t3_3jbqos,uPaintwithstars from rparrots vsuPerion from rgurrenlagannThe two stared at each other from across the field. It had finally come to this after years of spars and close calls the two were finally meeting face to face to settle the war between the Earth and Sky people.uPaintWithStars stared at her opponent with disgust. These dirty mole people had been a nuisence to her people for years. Gross. She thought to herself. I always forget about their horrid smell. The Sky people have always had a nearmiraculous sense of smell. Honed over thousands of generations it helped her people avoid the predators that fed on her birds. Her flight of parrots obviously perturbed by the same scent squawked overhead. uPaintWithStars had always been a gifted bird wrangler much like her Grandmother a legend among her tribe. Though only  she had already accumulated over  birds in her flock although almost half of them didnt make it out of her last encounter with uPerion alive.....That was a good day thought uPerion who was also thinking of their last encounter. uPaintWithStars had foolishly followed him into a large underground cave thinking that her affinity with all birds would extend to the cave bats that lived there. However when the bats failed to respond to her calls uPerion a gifted driller crashed through the roof of the ceiling hoping to collapse the cave on top of her and her menacing birds. Unfortunately uPaintWithStars sensed the trap a moment too soon and was able to call her flock together to fly her out of the cave as quickly as they could. A bittersweet victory however as uPerion had also trapped the cave entrance which came crashing down taking out a few dozen parrots with it.Now the two had nowhere to run to. No backup to call and they both knew this would be their final showdown. This would be the battle that would decide once and for all who would continue to live at the Earths surface and who would be driven either back underground or back to the skies....a fate neither Kingdom could live through again.Taking advantage of her air superiority uPaintWithStars called her flock down each parrot grasping a strap of her combat dress in its steelreinforced beak. Together they lifted her into the sky in an arc whos trajectory would bring her right down on uPerion s head. Stay there you rat she thought bearing down on him. Cant dig your way out of this one. uPaintWithStars had chosen this field on purpose the natural hot springs in the area meant that any digger that tried to go underground would be cooked alive almost immediately. Closing in she readied her staff bringing it down on his stupid little head. Somethings wrong she sensed. Her shoulderparrot Benjamin was tugging her away from the encounter. Too late. As she brought down the staff instead of the satisfying crack of wood hitting skull she felt a soft poof as the staff struck the dummys head.uPerion bust up almost immediately in a fantastic spray of boiling hot steam water and rock. It was a horrid cacophony of squawking feathers rock and blood. His hazard suit had not held up nearly as well as he had hoped and he had been nearly cooked alive waiting for uPaintWithStars to strike. As the dust and steam settled uPerion looked over the waste through puffy burned eyes. Dead parrots lay everywhere baking on the scorched stone. Heh he wheezed....smells like chicken. A phrase he had heard many times yet still had no idea what the hell a chicken was. As he slowly clawed his way to his knees uPerion looked for his opponent. With any luck she didnt survive his suicidal maneuver. When he finally found her half buried about  yards away she was barely breathing. Benjamin her only friend since she was  pecking at her face trying to rouse her. As uPerion approached the bird squawked at him threateningly. Can it.. uPerion barked as he warily eyed the bird while fingering the large scar on his face that Benjamin had given him years before. As he ripped the necklace containing the Sky Jewel from uPaintWithStars s neck away. uPerion stared at his foe intently. I should kill her. he thought. Well only end up fighting again. Even though he knew their next battle would be suicidal for her as neither she nor her Kingdom could control birds anymore without the Sky Jewel. Sighing and dropping his shoulders uPerion started back towards his clanmates who were hiding back in the woods. He figured the best thing to do was to get the Sky Jewel underground as quickly as possible before it could do any more damage. Besides... he thought theres no way I could kill my own sister in cold blood.,IDareYou,cuohpxh,5,t5_2r62p
