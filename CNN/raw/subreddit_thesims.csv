26522,0,t1_cehg1me,...I posted a god damn album explaining that this isnt true. In my album it takes my sim exactly  minutes to wander all the way downstairs across the house and into the bathroom. It takes him an hour to wake up go downstairs pee and shower. If it takes an hour for your sim to get to the bathroom build your house like a house and not like a courtyard I guess. Or stick a bathroom next to the bedroom. A sim doesnt even take an hour to cross a x lot. How damn big are your houses that it seriously takes an hour? Sims  is the easiest game in the series. Objectively. You have to eat once a day and it doesnt even have to be a meal. I dont get how people have trouble with this.,thesims,cehga2h,-15,t5_2rbdu

840877,0,t3_23rd3z,Dont bother reinstalling corrupt installations are very rare. Rename DocumentsElectronic ArtsThe Sims  and start the game to let it generate fresh user folders. Best practices include patching manually launching the game from the app and not the launcher using Error Trap and Overwatch using packages instead of SimsPacks scanning packages with Dashboard and compressing with spe using Twallans Saver or AwesomeMods auto save feature keeping multiple saves with Save As for your important saves and keeping your save games small by regularly deleting SNAP resources with Kurees save cleaner and spe. Obviously back up your user folders regularly. Some people like to start with new user folders every once and again just copying over their saves saved sims library presets etc.I play on a Mac like actually on a Mac with the game shoved in Cider not with Bootcamp or anything and have zero crashes because Im very careful about stuff like the above. Im assuming you play on a PC like most people in which case much of the above is easier because you dont have to wrestle with Mono. You also have a number of other programs available to you to help straighten out your game CC Magjc and such as well as other programs to improve performance when it comes to things like lag. Edit I see you mention that most problems started after installing a couple EPs. Definitely definitely patch manually. Then make sure its not simply an issue of your computer not being able to handle that many EPs. Keep in mind that charts like the one found on the MTS wiki indicating the minimum specs needed for various EPs are showing what you need for only that specific EP it doesnt take into account multiple installed EPs. ,thesims,cgzuzbp,7,t5_2rbdu

842702,0,t1_cgzwgq0,I dont think you need a totally new installation. Im not familiar with TSPD but I believe you can use the super patch at this point. Yeah a lot of people have issues with patching through the launcher. Ive heard of instances where the game version noted in the launcher wasnt actually the version the game was really on so they were getting stupid bugs and glitches that had in reality long been fixed.And yes start the game from TS.exe instead of the launcher. On a Mac this entails editing a line in the info.plist file. Im not sure if its the same on a PC but just Google sims  bypassing the launcher and youll find directions. I had terrible startup issues right after I installed the Island Paradise EP. The game would get stuck on the first loading screen eat up all my memory and crash before getting to the Main Menu. I tried lots of things but the same exact thing happened every time. What worked for me was the Ultimate Fix from gamestheworld. Apparently other people have found it helpful for crashing at other times and shittiness in general obviously by the name its billed as a sort of cureall but your mileage may vary. If you want to give it a shot I would recommend backing up a copy of the files it asks you to replace as they are not in your user folders and will not be restored by generating a new The Sims  folder. Edit if youre going the Ultimate Fix route I believe it asks you to use a manual patch during the course of it so look at those instructions first.,thesims,ch02gk3,1,t5_2rbdu

896067,0,t1_ch61qnn,Oh well thanks for the praise first of all  Im not even sure Im quite aware of the process I use to build houses myself. But since youre coming from a programming background why dont you take some basic approaches from IT and try to apply them to Sims as well? When I start out a house much like creating a programm I typically try to think of the general layout and function. Its best to modularize the whole thing from the get go and try to get a feeling on how each component affects the other What kind of shape do I want for the building? Where does the garden go? What about a pool inside? Is there supposed to be a garage? If so is it in the house or even on a hill? Does that leave enoughtoo much space to live inside?Once the fundaments of everything is reserved you modularize it further. What kind of rooms do I need and where do I place them? What goes in the firstsecond floor? Are there multiple bathbedrooms? What cool room ideas can be realized with what the game has to offer in terms of assets? Try drawing the rough outlines of the rooms with walls and change them as you see fit. Are they sorted properly? Do I have to trample through the kids room to get to the bath? Stuff like that. Then comes the furniture. Look at any room at a time and select roughly appropriate wallpapers and tiles. Again why not follow the IT principle Make it work. Then make it work better. Think of what is mandatory for this room i.e. a fridge oven and lots of counters for a kitchen? Then think of what is optional for this room perhaps a bar small table or one of those fancy teriyaki grills? I tend to select the stuff I like best from any given item category and throw it in there before I even have an idea of where to put it exactly. If you find something cool that would just be perfect for another room while browsing  same principle  just switch over to that room throw it in there without bothering much and return to where you were. You can always sort it out later. By now your house should be filled with multiple heaps of cool stuff in otherwise empty rooms  So just arrange the items in however configuration looksworks best keep doors and windows in mind though add decorations like carpets lights plants paintings random stuff possibly adjust the wallpapertiles try to compile without an ArrayOutOfBoundsException and call it a day.Im sure its not as clearly cut as I make it out to be  theres always some chaos involved and I guess thats where part of the fun lies   but thats the jist of it. One task at a time with care every time. I hope that helped and made some sense!,thesims,ch64y74,41,t5_2rbdu

1318802,1,t1_cihyllm,gt What make me the most made about this features removal is the reason. It caused too much lag.  Well heres an idea make a game that isnt optimised shit instead of removing features.CAST is unoptimized as a concept. The game has to keep track of your color choices for every single object and clothing and hair and makeup and accessory and wallpaper and floor in the game world. It cant load those all at once or load times would be  minutes.It cant keep them all in memory either or the game would move at a snails pace. So the option is to load them as you move the camera around which still takes a lot of memory and power which is why even the developers get white objects on their PCs that they surely can run the game on.Theres no way to do CAST and have it optimized at the same time. With current average hard drives and CPUs it just isnt a thing they can do. Remembering  slots of options for  things at once just isnt feasible.Its like if they made a game with  characters on screen and it ran slowly and when they dropped it to  characters for optimizaton you said Well dont drop characters just optimise the game dummies!. It doesnt make any sense they ARE optimizing the game by dropping characters. Thats the only real option.,thesims,cihzdax,6,t5_2rbdu

1359252,0,t1_cimlizi,Because you have to go into Edit town save switch to a new active household.....and then!Then the household you were playing pretty much goes on vacation.  They age but they do not progress at all and their lives may or may not fall apart.  EA story progression may kill off random Sims when the town gets overpopulated.  Your sim may get a new job to fill a spot that the game needs.Basically rotational gameplay is not worth the hassle because you do not have control at all unless the family is the active household.  ,thesims,cimo7pw,3,t5_2rbdu
1359538,0,t3_29ndwl,Hmm my first reaction to this is that I loved seeing how the random Sims around mine would hook up and reproduce but maybe theres a silver lining in this.I haaaaate the sim limit in households. I love having control of loads and loads of Sims.Maybe in TS rather than needing to mod the game to break the sim limit I can populate my entire active neighborhood area with families I want to play. I cant have more than  sims active at any given point in time sure but if the Sims in the inactive households arent going to screw themselves up too much and if switching the active family isnt too timeconsuming this might actually work well for my style of play.Except Ill probably have to break that sim limit with a mod anyway because I have a pair of Sims I want to recreate and they have around  children.But still maybe I could have all my favorite Sim families recreated in the same neighborhood area rather than having them all in different game instances because I cant trust story progression not to screw them over somehow if Im not actively playing them.,thesims,cimpi3o,9,t5_2rbdu

The only reason I am buying this game is when steam have it on sale for like . or something. Seriously Im not paying for a crap product because of something that is difficult to do. Future expansions of a franchise is supposed about innovation and being bold to challenge the limits and not be hampered because it is difficult to animate or whatever bullht reason that may be. And dont tell me to expect anything less because youre sugar coating the game with the aesthetic but the core dynamics of player freedom CAS gameplaylife stagetoddler gone no pools seriously sims  had pools and an open world gone is such a HUGE STEP back that even the aesthetic cant appease. And its not something that you cant add later..of course not. You simply cant. CAS is a core mechanic life stagetoddler is a core mechanic that if you add it in later expansion it will simply destroy the gameplay core. Either you add those basic things now or just give up. I am really sad about the direction of sims. I feel betrayed by the set backs the devs are bringing to the table. Its like being back in dayZ when I got kidnapped and repeatedly being forced to eat rotten stuff and drink chlorine until I die. Just my  cents.,thesims,cinykfz,20,t5_2rbdu

I only played maybe a total of an hour in actual play in the last few years. I get jealous of seeing people play Legacies because I never could. Im excited about the Sims  because they have showed that loading doesnt take as long. There are things that make it easier to play. So what if pool and toddlers and cars and open worlds ...etc... are missing. I dont miss them because I could play them anyway!Why cant I like a game?

Not a bunch of the over the top already planned out BS the other gameplay videos have included where sims are keeling over dead and all this other drama.I am still hesitant about the sims . This gameplay didnt really look all too different from the sims . I really like how seamlessly the sims moved and performed actions though. The graphics looked really nice too. The house interior looked great reminds me of the sims .The emotions look like a good feature but not that different from previous games. I dont think they should have marketed that aspect as heavily as they did.My one complaint would be that the neighborhoods look kinda dead especially when he goes downtown to meet Bella.

1739329,0,t1_cjy83w1,That might be because that person is either just now getting into sims or doesnt play it as much as everyone here but wanted to get more involved. I am just now getting my boyfriend into playing it. Do you think Im yelling at him and being condescending when he doesnt understand something? No because that would discourage him from playing and its unnecessary.And you didnt clarify anything in those repeated attempts you just said the same thing over and over. Clearly there was an element they were missing. They were missing the point of the post that instead of having less options they were just organized in a more efficient way. You didnt explain that until the third reply. So really  its a miscommunication on your part. If anyone should be angry it should be the other person because youre too dim to understand that saying the same thing over and over doesnt clarify anything.But most people dont get upset about such tiny things.

Apparently there are people who feel that the game needs to be easier. Fine. But give us a hard mode or something so that the game stays a game and not a dollhouse.

2864332,0,t1_cntkw32,I really dont recommend that at all. If you have access to a Windows partition to play TS you should do it. EA no longer works with Aspyr and the Mac version is just a Cider port which means its not actually a port at all but rather emulation almost exactly like running the Windows version through Wine. And to be honest I find Cider to be consistently less reliable than Wine. Long story short the Mac version will be like x slower and x as buggy.

2995969,0,t3_2uhgwi,The game really needs some form of story progression. As is the only interesting Sims for me are my active family. Everyone else is pretty much just background fluff. Other than grow older nothing happens to them if theyre not currently visible to the active family.Regarding the poll Active Careers Im OK with the idea though I wonder how it will fit into The Sims . What happens if you have two Sims with active jobs? The game currently doesnt support multiple view points and does a pretty meh job with controlling Sims who arent at your active destination. Business Owner The current game is sorely lacking in things to buy and places to buy them from. I would love to have more reasons to leave the active house as is everything just automagically pops into being when needed. Having things like tattoos and clothes be purchasable would be a lot more interesting than merely leaving them to be cheated in when you want to change things up. City Living All for more destinations in town. Apartments Id have to see. Given how conservative they were on lot size in the base game generally smaller and capped at  floors no basements itd be rough to put multiple families in the current game. Fame and Fortune As far as Im concerned the celebrity system added nothing of value to the game. Id often have families full of celebrities who rarely ever needed to leave the house and yet still famous enough to warrant paparazzi why would anyone even know who they are? If actingsinging careers were more dynamic that might be interesting. I love having Sims who can create actual things in the game rather than working in rabbit holes that dont do anything. Health and Wellness sounds like a game pack to me. Doesnt seem like itd do much more than add a few new objects and expand the existing Gym lot. Supernatural I know the weird stuff bothers some people but Im ok with it. Wouldnt mind seeing them again though theres the risk that towns would quickly become filled with vampireswerewolves given how current progression works. Town Life sounds a lot like City Living. Id definitely like to get to modify the existing world more than the game currently allows though.And as for previous expansions Pets I want to see how theyd look but I kinda feel busy enough as is even with a small family. Pets would be another thing to micromanage but inherently have little to do. If theyre largely autonomous Id definitely prefer them to toddlers though! World Adventures I really dont see open world coming back and I cant imagine how these would be more than themed neighborhoods. Maybe a game pack but an entire expansion would be too much I think. Into the Future I love the idea but again the expansion is so tied to neighborhoods I cant see it working in The Sims . University I liked having it in previous games but I have to wonder how it would work. IIRC in  its almost like a bubble life stage it exists if your Sim does it but if they dont go that time never happens. I think a themed university neighborhood would work better than most of the other separate worlds of  at the least.,thesims,co8j36d,6,t5_2rbdu
2998361,0,t3_2uf618,Recoloring clothes in TS isnt hard and is very similar to TS. I never created for TS really.

3219804,0,t3_2wzcbh,The Sims Resource and Mod the Sims are good places to start looking for mods and cc. I have never had any problems with them. Both sites have tutorials but long story shortIn your documents folder on your computer there is a file called Electronic Arts and in that folder is another one called The Sims . Drop the cc in the folder that says Mods. If the file isnt a .package type than you have to unzip it and extract the file from it if you have Windows  then this is built in if not than Zip is what you need to google and download.Once you have Zip click on the file and go to Zipgt Extract here. This will leave you with a .package file in your Mods folder. If you are downloading a lot than do the same thing except do it in the Tray folder instead of the Mods folder.

EA removed from The Sims  far too much of what I like about The Sims   the clothing and decor customization were huge winners for me and I rather liked being able to travel throughout the neighbourhood without the cutscreen which does not save time by any stretch.

I close everything but OriginSims  while playing I make sure the laptop is well ventilated plugged in etc. I also customized my settings but find I only really have issues if I have view distance on high and postprocessing on. So I only really turn them on when Im sharing lots to the gallery better gallery images. Other than that its fine for the most part. I turned laptop mode off bc it makes things look terrible and I keep most things on medium except the D scene resolution and sim detail are on high. I usually turn reflections and visual effects on low. I also have a shit ton of mods but Im not really experiencing much lag  although I am tempted to just build a new gaming rig myself even though itd be impractical just to play the sims oddly I can manage MMOs like GW and SWTOR just fine. ,thesims,cqo5wt0,1,t5_2rbdu

3876800,0,t1_cqy20ut,Its pretty similar actually. But in the same way I wasnt particularly into its Sims  form although a lot of that had to do with strange roofing concerns and the snow would bug into the house for no good reason at all. It also just feels a bit different overall because of the open world. Weathers pretty mundane when its confined to a specific lot but since youre seamlessly exploring an entire town world in Sims  the seasons add a level of dynamism to the town that would otherwise be fixed in a constant static state.It basically just corrects some of humdrum boring sameness whenever you revisit the same areas by making them different across seasons. The public parks have seasonal events and the central park in Sunset Valleywhich was always my favorite community lotaccordingly has those event objects thrown into it for different new things to do as the seasons change. Theres the standard holiday fare and also trickortreating on Halloween where you indeed go to your neighbors houses and other random amenities that come with expansion packs. Frankly its a lot of content that ideally should have been featured in the base game. Also in tandem with Supernatural your supernatural Sims can manipulate the towns randomlyplaced Weather Stone.Heres a more thorough reviewoverview for Seasons and if you arent familiar yet with LGR Reviews theyre pretty much the goto videos if you want to learn more about Sims expansions.

4314661,0,t1_csaz8d3,I think I can relate to you also having been lurking and watching reviews for every expansion that came out for TS and after a lot of thinking I finally pulled the trigger yesterday for  USD. Not gonna lie after putting  hours into it Im also disappointed at all the removed content which I used a lot such as create a style and open world maps but you know... at least for it it felt worth it. Sure I had  to create a mental block to imagine TS didnt even exist to not ruin my own experience but hey TS was a pretty awesome game on its own right and it didnt have any of the cool features TS introduced. Imo TS feels more like an alternative version of what TS could have been and even if everything is more small scaled Im liking it so far. I have an SSD which makes loading times much better and Im really happy with the emotion system and multitasking abilities of sims and I think that for  usdit was a really good purchase. Im not by any means saying its better than TS because it just isnt but thats not to say its as terrible as people think it is.

4859167,0,t1_cu6p2nv,Interesting idea adding tweens. And I can only get behind that. Essentially puberty age where girl sims find out about boys boy sims find out about girls they may battle with their sexuality.Also FFS add the preference thing where I can set my gay sims to be gay or bi or straight. This I can flirt with anyone is dumb. I want my sim to be like fuck no when a gender he is not attracted to is flirting with him.Also generations could let is change traits. People change. Like my current sim. He went from an asshole to a quite rich painter adopted a son and feels sorry for his wrongdoings to his exwife and his daughter both left him.

4965220,0,t3_3it2zt,Ok there are two ways to work around this.I saw the first one in a pic tutorial on Tumblr. I cant find it so Im going to try to explain it.Alright say you have a plant you want to freeplace on a counter.  Place the plant on the counter. Then pick the plant back up and move it off to the side. Fill every slot on that counter with clones of the plant. Now that every slot is filled you can pick up the original plant hold alt and place it anywhere on the counter.  When you have the plant where you want it just delete the other plants.Most of the time this can be a pain because you cant always see what youre doing with all the objects cluttering the surface. I usually use another method. Place the plant on the counter then pick up the counter and move it off to the side. Hold alt and move the plant to the empty space where the counter was. Now you just have to estimate where the plant would be sitting if the counter was there. Now move the counter back to its original spot. If you dont like where the flowers are positioned just undo and move the flower around again then move the counter back.I hope I explained this well enough. If you dont understand something I can try to explain it more.,thesims,cukekrz,4,t5_2rbdu

6099514,0,t1_cyipsrx,I respect your opinion. Thats why negative traits are sorely needed in this game not an expansion pack full of doom and gloom. And it would please everyone which is what EA seems to like doing because you can download a trait pack download it for the content but never make a sim with that trait. I know that if EA offer new opportunities and more consequences based on the traits I would snap it up in a second. Give us things like Anxious Gossip Obsessive Dramatic etc and make the other traits do more than what they currently do. Why arent neat sims tidying themselves up more often? Why cant they get angry and tell a slob thats messing up their kitchen to BEAT IT? You dont have to actually get them to be mean to the other sim.

I do admit that I have a tendency of making my sims moreorless perfect and have to purposely sway away from this monotony but having these kind of situations built into the game would help propel these kind of emotional stories instead of these cookiecutter ones that I always seem to concoct.  Just today I made a lovely male sim for one of my favorite legacy girls and moved them in together. After  sim days I realized how ordinary their story was and tried to imagine some type of conflict other than adultery divorce or other typical sim drama.  The worst part?

With that mod you wont burn out on all of the content and feel overly grinder and overwhelmed with repetitive gameplay as playing a legacy you can try things out at a much slower speed and each life feels more individual when youre not just rushing through contentpromotions trying to micromanage multiple families. Then the Sims start to lose their personalities and unlike previous games the stock sims even the familiar ones are pretty boring The mod is essential if you want to play legacy style as without it the entire world will die off and only ugly babies will be born and not enough to repopulate the town. Luckily with the mod everything works like you would expect.I had recently started playing the Sims  again ultimate edition and was entranced with the more adult style humor and the crazy stories that immediately developed Nina got pregnant with Dons baby but died unexpectedly not my doing right after birth leaving her bum sister with the baby and no motivation to take care of it so she coerced Don to come into the house accumulating assets planning on seducing the Goths for more moneys but luckily Cassandra already got together with Dirk so theyre well off meanwhile the Pleasant sisters who were with DIrks son and Dustin Broke who fell into an early life of crime to support his broke ass family. They all were going to go to college together but at the last second Dustin couldnt go because his mom spent their last  similions on pizza meaning they couldnt afford the Nanny so he had to skip school and take care of the baby aging up and thus missing his chance to go to college.So all of this is deep entrenched content with lots of depth and attention to detail and more adult humor than sims  and  combined.That being said I had to stop playing because I missed how lovely my Sims  Sims are they are just freaking beautiful and feel more real than any of the other Sims even if there humor is a bit less they look and act much more believable. And really the  graphics of the genetics alone are so amazing in the Sims  that you really want to see your next offspring. Also playing legacy style I get insanely attached my to my Sims where as playing ts rotational style I started to hate them all. The kicker was  in ts to get into my University on my shit HD I had to go through  long ass loading screens which I thought is kind of worth it because theres so much more content but then when you see all of the work that the devs put into optimization and fixing all of the old bugs that hindered gameplay  in ts blocked routes and such there is great potential in this game.   It is so easy to use. When I start a town in the Sims  I create a beautiful legacy founder and then I immediately just drop in starter homes and my favorite looking user created Sims from the gallery. I tend to pick stunning gorgeous creative types and they the top rated ones always have much more personality than the stock vanilla ones. So its really as easy as just clicking and dropping and your town gets filled up with awesome beautiful Sims who with the master controller mod will all hook up naturally and have beautiful amazing recognizable offspring for your legacy into interact with. Its worth it I think just dont get Get to Work I think its really bad but Get Together is pretty essential imo while not really great and doesnt add that much it is very essential to letting you use what is already available to make stories and control your Sims in different ways.So in summary a lot of the humor is still toned down and silly but its more juvenilehipster college themed than childish and barby style which is a little step up from ts imo though still a far notch down from the more adult focused humor of ts. So if you loved the ts sims than I think you will just explode with love for ts ones. THey are amazing. The other huge advantage with ts than any of the others is the efficiency and optimization of everything from building to populating your town to CAS to loading screens everything is extremely easy and fast now. For example there are search options in the buildbuy mode so you can just type in toilet and everything will pop up. Building is a dream. Its been improved every way. The game is missing a ton of content but that will surely come. The only looming scary question is will the devs add enough systems stuff like reputation influence hobbies ext to give the gameplay the depth that it needs to go from being a good game to a great one and further personalize each sim. IMO.,thesims,cz5ewfd,1,t5_2rbdu

6695521,0,t1_d0buhb8,gt Thank you very much for taking the time to reply.No problem! By the way Reddit is such an awkward medium with which to respond to long comments so Im sure this will be very disjointed.gt Id be very happy to take this to modmail No need.gt I will grant that we can downvote or ignore. That is the easy way.Its not the easy wayits the way Reddit works. You should upvote things that are relevant thoughtful and contributing to discussion you should feel free to downvote things that are not. A post saying something like I have  which pack should I get really isnt any of those things. But a post that says I want to buy one of the game packs which have you gotten more use out ofspas or camping? is a different case in my view. In the first OP is just being a lazy decisionmaker offering nothing to start a conversation in the second OP has obviously attempted to narrow down their options and is asking for more specific feedback.gt I dont mean to be contrary but which EP should I buy is not the actual main issue. Perhaps I was not clear or we have gone off track. I have answered many threads about this and so have others in depth. Most people dont mind answering specific questions. which game is better for builders or  should I get x vs y pack are not that irritating and actually add to the discussion.Im confused your title is literally What do we want to do about the should I buy posts!gt What I feel is harming the feel of the sub is the constant  sims x vs sims y postsDo you mean TS vs. TS? Or TS pack vs. TS pack? For the former I would not be in favor of shutting down such discussion so long as it stays within the bounds of our rules and guidelines. Most people though manage to talk about these things without behaving like a dick. For the latter I dont believe Ive seen any conflict regarding the merits of one pack vs. another...but again I wouldnt be bothered as long as it stayed civil. I am super not interested in walking around with my mod stick making sure people are holding hands and singing Kumbaya. gt and also like you said the its that they cant decide for themselves issue. What do we do about that?About the fact that people are indecisive?! Nothing Im sure. Hopefully the info in the wiki will weed out the people that are not just indecisive but lazy.gt I do not believe you.Now this is just ridiculous. Do you think Im lying about having to click back a couple pages to see the last post like that? I dont really know how to respond to that so Ill just point out that you can sort the sub by new to see all the posts in the order they were submitted. RES says the last what should I buy post I see was submitted on Sunday.gt Please keep me the sub updated on what you are working on and how we can help.Im going to finish up the entry in the wiki right after I submit this comment. edit Finished. The TS page is separated now as well so I think thats a bit clearer to see from the main wiki page. Ways to help Downvote posts that do not contribute to discussion If you see an OP of a what should I buy post who has obviously not done the basic research or looked at the wiki politely link them to the page If you see an OP of a what should I buy post who seems to have put some thought into it and is posting information that actually helps others understand what theyre looking for consider helping them out and giving them your opiniongt oh and stop banning my angry friends they make this sub more interesting even if they are idiots!Tell your angry friends to stop breaking the rules ,thesims,d0bvi7x,0,t5_2rbdu

6712783,0,t1_d0djvy4,I just currently dont see a way to make it sustainable. I switched active households quite frequently and that sustained me for a bit but it wasnt long before it became so this household enjoys focusing on this activity. Ok lets see what its like and after three in game days I knew what it was like and there was nothing left to see. Switching eventually lost its replay value.Likewise I dont think just disobeying whims and playing however I want is a solution either. My fear is that if I do that Im going to pump the well dry in a matter of hours and thatll be that.This thread was more about trying to see if for example the majority of Sims  players were Legacy players or the like just to get an understanding of what keeps people going but yeah unfortunately Im being downvoted on the premise of not worshipping the game in its entirety. I mean I dont think I said anything out of line or offensive here I was legitimately asking for advice because I DO honestly feel bad that Im struggling to enjoy a gift this much but I also cant really change my reactions thusfar without lying to myself.,thesims,d0dnqx2,1,t5_2rbdu

6758654,0,t3_48bv60,With a bit of research it looks like those numbers are not reliable. The source the data is attributed to is the Video Game Sales Wiki for The Sims and you can see in the references that the data in the Wiki entry is based on a variety of sources i.e. the Wiki page is not comparing apples to apples.To compare apples to apples you can look at a proxy like Google search volume instead here Definitely less hype for Sims  compared to  and  but after the initial spike Sims  is holding up not too bad.EDIT Its important to point out as well that Google Trends shows normalized search volume search volume for a topic like The Sims  in relation to total volume of searches for all topics so there may well have been more interest for The Sims  than for any other game in the franchise. The fact that searches for PC games as a whole are trending down here supports this hypothesis.EDIT  Formatting.,thesims,d0iegiy,9,t5_2rbdu

7473101,0,t1_d2rmcbu,gtYeah and a lot of players seem to take pride in having a complete collection when it comes to Sims.I always felt that was so weird. Like when people buy the Katy Perry pack just to have a complete collection it just makes me cringe. Then again that might just be because I was raised in a low middle class family and asking my parents for video games made me feel guilty  gtBut apparently some players were angry about needing to have both EPs to get all the features from ALIf this is true then Im in disbelief. AL was one of the TS xpacs that I had and when I got the Ultimate Collection I was so happy when I saw the witch with a cat familiar. I didnt feel cheated at all or that it was a ploy to get people to spend their money which is a pretty big deal I mean Im still convinced toddlers are gonna come in an xpac so that EA can steal our money so Im a hardcore cynic when it comes to this kind of stuff.But I mean some Simmers tend to be babies about a lot of stuff so I can easily see a vocal handful ruining it for everyone else.,thesims,d2rnb5t,2,t5_2rbdu

7626984,1,t1_d394eyp,A fun look at the game pack huh? You mean like this? Remember that? Almost exactly one month ago...? And remember tweets before that saying they know were hungry for new content?Its been months. Im sorry but if I could speak with EA right now my question would be if I cannot entrust your company to recognize when your lack of info is reaching a point where it becomes infuriating how am I supposed to trust you can produce quality content and a solid product...? It is not my duty as a customer to hold my own interest in an upcoming product its their duty to sell it to me. Despite this EA seems to think that if I find out so much as how many food products there are in this game pack before release then by God a thousand year long Mummys curse will befall their entire development team. If there is no restriction on info then yes I do believe now would be a fantastic time to start taking questions. Yes I do expect some degree of understanding for where customers may stand in terms of the news flow. Yes I do expect the company to have some degree of inkling to where they stand in the timespace continuum. When this is month  of teasers and trailers I got news for you theres a thousand other companies out there eager to tell me every detail about their product so they can have my money. Why shouldnt I pay them instead? Lets be as critical as possible for a moment. Get Together already has Barista cafes. In them you can purchase food and drink and sit and chat with people. Bars function similarly and you can eat and drink with others while hanging out. Get To Work has retail stores. They function like shit but theyre there. Now what about restaurants is offering something that I dont already have? Whats new? What seperates this from the already existing content?You and I as sentient human beings can deduce surely something must be different in a meaningful way! Trying to resell us the exact same content would be borderline retarded! Yes of course thats a fair assumption and I wouldnt blame anyone for jumping to that conclusion. But in the scope of tangible evidence we have been given zero reason to believe this experience is different in a meaningful way. Combine that with the fact EA seems to think the thousandth teaser would be acceptable right now and yknow what? Yeah Im starting to question how fleshed out this game pack is. Granted I have no overwhelming reason to suspect its shit of course I just mean that when Im sitting here thinking it could be interesting or it could be dull and akin to stuff thats already in game then Im not exactly eager to make a purchase yknow?The whole thing just leaves me thinking nah time to stop bothering. I am clearly at odds with fan reactions to this. Everyone is free to react to this trailer however they please and Im not judging but when theres a serious gap between the SQUEEE IM SCREAMING AND SHAKING that some people are having and my but wheres the actual info...? then I do seriously start to question if Im this games target demographic and if Id have any semblance of fun purchasing this product. So as I said have fun everyone but personally this whole experience has only damaged my already lackluster opinion on EA.,thesims,d395b2i,-6,t5_2rbdu

7770112,0,t1_d3p6igk,Yeah I like the idea of a curfew as well.

Awesome Mod has an option to tweak that behavior in that the kids are only caught if police are calledare already on the lot which I like.,thesims,d3pee1a,8,t5_2rbdu
7801069,0,t1_d3slll8,Yeah I was just talking to someone about how theres such a crazy disconnect between the game industry and its users.

7805056,0,t1_d3t7ejg,This is the strangest season Ive filmed so far. There are a lot of big personalities...and a few odd ones.Christie for example tends to follow a houseguest attempting to open conversation  then she stops and runs away. Or shell start talking and abruptly end the conversation. Its very bizarre. So the paranoia comes from that behavior.Howard the dirty grandpa SOMEHOW manages to be better liked than BethyAnne.

I am really glad they fixed this.To me other than the gender stuff and the lighting it seems like the rest is bug fixes not necessarily huge expansive content fixes.

8026868,0,t1_d4i3ahp,There was no hesitation to believe you dont watch porn.  Even if you did you might not have come across a scene like this.  Its an older concept and theyve shifted to different types of stories to escape the old cliches inventing new ones along the way but they havent had time to enter the public conscious.  It was more that its hard to know if someones serious on the Internet or joking.  Even without watching porn and I tend to avoid it because theres some recurrent themes in the modern crop that Im very uncomfortable with its very possible to know this cliche because it got so popular in porn that it became a running joke outside of it.I do assume pretty much everyone has seen at least some porn and most people watch it from time to time because multiple studies have been done and come to that conclusion.  People just dont publicly admit it because they might be judged for it but then again people also might judge others for playing Sims and murdering their darlings.  So either way Im not about to judge anyone on it.If youre not familiar with the term its a phrase used in writing to refer to killing off characters usually for storytelling purposes and not sadistic ideas like you know feeding someone to a cowplant milking it for life essence and then repeatedly cloning that to have an effectively immortal Sim.

8156707,0,t3_4qysal,Once upon a time I got really mad at Severus Snape for some reason and decided I needed revenge. I made a Sim of him and a Sim of Lily Evans making them roommates in a world with no James Potter. They soon fell in love and were married. Once the love and friendship bars were completely full I locked her in their bedroom and starved her at the last minute I let in Snape just so he would watch her die.I let him get over his grief it was a long process and he wrote many books telling of his love for dear Lily and he cried especially hard upon seeing her ghost. Eventually when out and about at the library he met another girl I had created Genesis Royale. Like with Lily they fell in love moved in together and got married. Occasionally he would mourn for Lily but he was mostly content.Over time they had three beautiful children together Albus Robert and the youngest Lily. I finally let Snape release the spirit of his dead wife then began the second round of torment. I trapped Genesis and the kids in a pool and trapped Snape in a small fenced area nearby. Once more he watched as his loved ones were taken from him one by one as they succumbed to exhaustion and drowned.I intended to force him to live out the rest of his days in emotional agony but right after the Reaper took Genesis the last to die he keeled over in a puddle of his own urine. I found it quite fitting.,thesims,d4x4x6d,12,t5_2rbdu

8348586,0,t3_4tvq1x,I like the pack I like the slide idea the chimes are super cute and sound nice the birds are also cute and a good addition to my sims backyard. However my sims do not slide down the water slide. They start disappear then pop out at the end. It was disappointing because I was really looking forward to watching them do tricks down the slide. Basically the main reason I bought the pack was to watch them go down the slide and I cannot do that. I love the Sims I never complain about anything with this game not even toddlers and Im a huge family player. However this this is making me complain. I buy every pack that comes out because I love the game. I think they are doing great things with it. But I cant help but feel like I wasted  on this. I try not to think like that though because Im pretty sure that a patch will come out soon to fix it as I am not the only one experiencing this. It was posted on the forum as well and someone mentioned that the devs do know about it. However it still makes me feel cheated in a way because the biggest asset to this pack were the slides and I cannot even enjoy that.

The Prom Mod has an issue when you place the lots from the Gallery or the Library if you played with Zerbus Go to School or Turbo Career Mods its the same exact issue...its something within the games engine which we cant really control. Anyway to fix the problem when you place a Generic lot for your prom just set the lot type to something random if you use my Prom venue just change it to Bar exit build mode enter build mode again then set the lot type back to Generic. It will then show up when you go to plan your prom event.  You can also travel to the lot first then start the event from there.  Hope that helps!  Have fun lt,thesims,d6to3cm,4,t5_2rbdu

8963688,0,t3_52z56l,Id just like to say that I love the Sims and have been playing since I was  basically right around when Sims  came out! and have played every rendition probably way too much. I really enjoyed all of the content of Sims  but it ran terribly on my computer. I love how smooth the Sims  is and I love the graphics. I think its a great looking game and build mode is just wonderful overall though I am not a hardcore builder like some I am not heartbroken about not having CASt like some. I think for me as many have mentioned in this thread is the lacking family gameplay. And I fully accept that you all may have plenty of stuff being worked on behind the scenes that we dont know about that alleviate these concerns. I always loved toddlers and seeing a child grow. This was always one of my favorite things along with genetics and some of the Generationsstyle gameplay. To me Sims  would easily be the superior game of the series if some of the emptiness with life stages that arent young adultadult and if family gameplay was fleshed out.That being said I have really enjoyed the content thats been released. I think its great quality and of better quality than Sims  overall. City Living looks great. I am excited for it and I will probably buy it. It seems like a really great expansion. I like the emotion system and feel that Sims in the Sims  are much more expressive than Sims . I do think some of the emotions and traits could stand a little more variety or should matter more I guess but overall I really enjoy it.Thank you all for what you do. Were always looking forward to see what you come up with and we love it when you stop in to chat with us.  ,thesims,d7patm4,2,t5_2rbdu

9049977,0,t1_d7znpa5,I agree with you to an extent but it seems like they took that idea and just ran far away with it.No create a style not even a color wheel no open world and worlds are half the size of previous entries with literally no customisation.  Its all a bit much. And now apartments limited to one world and they cant be made from scratch. I think there is a point where it stops being about optimization and starts being about the gurus understanding the limits of the engine and wanting to create a certain look.Also as a side I hate when people say that they had to scale back from the open world and such because it was so laggyslow. They had  years to figure out how to make it work better. They had a whole games worth of experience to figure out what works and doesnt but instead cut almost everything out.  I find it hard to believe this wasnt the outcome of the failed sims  online project.  I feel for the gurus I really honestly do.

9072560,0,t3_54full,Ok so try this.. Move all the content out of your MODS folder except that resource file. And put it on your desktop for now. Move all the CC back into your MODS folder but this time make sure that if you are using sub folders like clothing shoes hair you create fresh versions of the sub folders. Then also make sure that your CC  isnt sitting in any sub folders. So sometimes you download the CC file and it will come in a folder already take it out of that folder. So basically when you move everything backing into the MODS folder make sure none of the CC is sitting in a sub folder unless it is the sub folders you have just newly created. So you should have your MODS folder then as an example your newly made Clothing sub folder and in the sub folder you should have all your CC files sitting there making sure none of them are sitting in any additional sub folders. As I said this exact thing happened to me when I copied my MODS folder into a thumb drive  and then tried to put it on another computer.

Basically to stop the engine from needing to render everything with the same amount of detail regardless of distance from the camera it measures that distance and adjusts the rendering of the meshes to put less strain on the engine and your computer. Zoomed out  more things on screen  more things to render  lower performance. As to a fix... I dont know. Are you graphics settings set to max?

10207054,0,t3_5m45lh,I know Im just a grumpy old fart at age  but thats ancient on the Internet but the more I see stuff like this the more disappointed I am when they answer Why isnt X in Sims ? with We have to have priorities on whats more important to put in the game.  City Living has weird NPCs running around in funky outfits that dont really add anything except humor I guess to the game.  And unless they worked on the animations I doubt the raccoon suits look right messing with stuff.  Plus all the random people walking around in the background cars and even planes which given that you pretty much never look up in Sims will only be noticed by an extremely tiny minority of people.  All of those things take time and development resources.  But we still cant get babies that arent bloody objects or teens that arent young adults or bloody elevators to put in our own buildings.I know I should just enjoy whats there but its just so annoying that time went into this stuff and then you see all the bugs the expansion had at launch as well as stuff thats not there.  Towel Man Trash Pandas drunkinsanewhatever Sims and French Maid Role Player were priorities I guess.I should get some coffee to perk me up and maybe look around the Internet for a while to help relower my expectations.

Im hoping that focusing the entire released pack on one thing will make that life state much more fleshed out rather than releasing a completely unrelated expansion and then also throw in this life state real quick.

Now it just pushes sims to go visit the community lot your sim is on. Totally fixed.I dont consider new meshes to be new content when it comes to the sims. I know they require work but they add no new gameplay. Instead of saying new I should have just stuck with saying premium for new items with new animations as thats how they referred to them in .I will agree with you on the hand holding one of my biggest gripes with  is how easy it is to keep everyone happy.

They listened to the community after about what  years later added in the game.. to me it is just weird they didnt had it sooner or that it was not in the base game at all.It would be ridiculous if the update wasnt for free. It should belong in a base game as it is right now. I got everything from the sims  expansions stuff and packs but if I had to pay just for this smallbig update it would just be stupid.anyway Im still hoping for pets seasons generations. especially generations because I think the world could be more life full as the creators expected it to be it the beginning.

Im drooling at the thought of different shapes we can make for them. Consequences too  like depletion of money due to cost of food that we have to buy. Or nail clippers. Or hairdryer. Shampoo. Teach people that maybe having animals arent that cheap just like toddlers...you can tell I really like kids. Walks everyday or the pet will be grumpy.  Get a trait for really lazy pets and then the really hyper pets. Or snobbish pets that ignores their owners because their owners are beneath their class. Or super clingy pets the ones that destroys the garden or house if their owners leave them for a bit. Option for pets that can live forever. A trait for humans whose lives revolves around their pets.Pets that can dislike someone without reason or maybe with reason. Maybe the pet happens to dislike hot headed person. Maybe the pet disagrees that the familys daughter is dating someone lazy. ....have a pet that could attack someone the family  or closest family member to them  dislike?? As someone whose dog just died from cancer thinking of Sims  with an animals can get sick thing is a lil too heartcrushing.

10881943,0,t1_de28sba,Since sex is intended for procreation and the number one genetically encoded goal for any living organism is to procreate it would make sense that in more complex organisms it is rewarded with hormones and impulses that make you feel satisfied and happy and that all organisms are designed to REALLY want to procreate whenever possible. This is just like eating especially highcalorie foods is fun and really satisfying for most people and just like looking as good as possible is satisfying for most people because since we have the biological urge to procreate we also want to look as sexually attractive to as many potential mates as possible. So yeah sex is supposed to feel fun because its the main thing ensuring the survival of a species. It naturally feels satisfying to engage in producing offspring. Humans do put a lot of cultural and other layers on top of biological desires though which may inhibit the wish to procreate or associate it with negative feelings. Maybe you just see fun as meaning something different because you say people enjoy the good feeling it gives but dont make a big deal of it  to my understanding enjoying a good feeling IS fun in itself and I would define them as one and the same  But in the context of sims I think its cute how they celebrate and cheer every time before Woohooing and by far not the least realistic thing about their actions... ,thesims,de2e8ec,3,t5_2rbdu

11260693,0,t3_60pmrs,It depends what you want out of the game. TS is a finished game so has a lot more content than TS. One of the main features is the open world  you can go anywhere at any time and there are no load screens apart from travelling to another world. They also introduced story progression meaning the families you are not controlling continue to age up get married move house have kids etc without your input though this can be disabled if you want. Almost everything can be recoloured and retextured ingame using preloaded patterns and a colour wheelRGBhex so you can customise walls floors furniture clothes hair eyes etc. however you like! With a decent PC you can run it with all the expansions and stuff packs loaded but the more you have the more gameplay can suffer lag stuttering are common and the greater chance it has of shitting itself. My  year old gaming laptop runs it just fine as long as I dont install too much custom content and as long as I remember to save often. TS took a step forward in some areas and a step back in others and its more like TSTS gameplay wise. There is no open world there are short load screens when travelling between lots story progression is limited to aging up sims and replacing dead sims the colour wheel for customisation is gone but you can chose from multiple preset styles. These all sound like a major step back however it means the game runs really well and is less intensive for older machines. TS also looks amazing the visuals are more stylised and cartoonish which I think matches the playfulness of the series well. It also means that TS sims look better and ironically more real than TS sims. Naturally its a younger game so there is a lot less EA content but they are still releasing packs and expansions plus they often release things in free updates like toddlers which arguably should have been there from launch but Im not going to get into that here. If you ask people which they prefer youre going to get a lot of different answers. I have played both but I couldnt get into TS  I loved the open world and customisation of TS too much and the various Nraas mods by Twallan meant I could tweak almost anything to my liking. I will admit I dont know much about TS mods or how they can change the game youd have to find someone else for that. If after this neither of these games take your fancy just find a copy of TS. It still holds up  ,thesims,df8dsl0,5,t5_2rbdu
11262500,0,t3_60qc48,It probably has to do with routing fences are a complete no routing at all blocker and lots have their own routing doohickeys at the edges so if you put a complete block along the edge where the routing switches from one...standard...to...umSee how the lines change on the lots? If there were fences on the edge youd interrupt all the lines that point to the lot which means when sims routed around a lot theyd walk  feet away from it and it could be harder for the nodes to connect to points inside the lot even at openings in the fence. If both of those bottom two lots had a fence on the edge thered be no routing nodes between the two and sims couldnt walk in between the lots at all because the routing points between the lots are only at the edges. So if the fence was there thered be no nodes between the two lots and so thered be no lines and sims couldnt walk between them. If the fence is on the inside it makes new nodes and keeps the old ones so sims can still walk between and close the the lot... Does that make sense?Sims can only walk from dot to dot and they can only walk on the line. If a fence was ther those dots would go away and thered be no way for them to find their way between the lots. Imagine the bottom lot had a fence all the way along the top right and bottom sides and the lot above it had a fence on its bottom side. Sims wouldnt be able to cross or walk down the road between them at all! Theyd have to run all the way around that whole area to get down the street.,thesims,df8l66d,13,t5_2rbdu

11266565,0,t3_60mann,About a month or so after the games launch I had a issue that made it hard for me to play a certain family anymore. I had binged played that day and had ended up with two poor sims that were in love and trying to make things better for their newborn. Both parents worked and sadly their jobs overlapped so a babysitter was needed for a few hours. The first two days were fine but than the third day happened. Mom went to work and a few hours later the babysitter showed up so dad could leave. The baby was in the crib when it started crying for food. The babysitter got up picked up the child and started to feed her and than all of a sudden the baby disappeared. I had no fcking clue on what just happened but one moment baby was there and next thing she wasnt. I clicked on her icon on the left side of the screen and the map dragged me away from the house and took me to the ocean. Somehow the baby was stuck in the ocean. No matter what I did or tried the baby was stuck. I remember posting screen shots of this on GameFaqs and people laughing their heads off at my grief. I was too annoyed and upset to try and restart the family. ,thesims,df91rj5,9,t5_2rbdu

Theres always a difference between how you see something in your head and how actual reality works. Something about the minds eye warps things. The gap is widened farther by the limitations of whatever software youre using.The sims is particularly weird about translating realworld dimensions so creating a sims house from a real floor plan or photo will often give you strange scale and proportion issues.
