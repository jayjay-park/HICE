7389879,0,t3_4gjr6i,Have you been practicing the breathing AND regular cold water exposure? If not please reconsider your attempt. If you have I would recommend having a friend watch you walk in and sit in shallow water up to your shoulders. Do you know the power breath? If not I recommend you try  seconds to one minute and dont put your face in the water. Again have a friend help you in case you freak out or pass out. Safely increase your time. If you have not taken the full course consider doing that. Best of luck and post your experience!,BecomingTheIceman,d2i6g6a,2,t5_2x9u1
8142894,0,t1_d4nc37k,Thats interesting that eating less fat had a positive effect on you. What types of fats  sources of fat did you cut down on?Ive found carbs especially grains seem to make me lethargic so Ive tended towards a vegetarian  ketogenic type diet. I havent noticed much effect from fats I try to stick with healthy fats high in omegas and low in omegas one way or the other.On a bit of a whim I tried a juice smoothie fast last year and went  days. Most of the smoothies had avocado and hemp protein powder so it wasnt strictly juice. I had a ton of energy and felt great though I hadnt yet learned of Wim Hof so I cant say how it would have affected my practice.,BecomingTheIceman,d4veoar,1,t5_2x9u1
8356552,0,t1_d5m3097,That scenario does match mine. Except that I have lower rest but my breathing still goes up to about  bpm. I have experience heart rate rush during the recovery breath not every time more when I hold it longer then  sec.Swedish ice man,BecomingTheIceman,d5m4dre,1,t5_2x9u1
10331053,0,t3_5nxl3z,Ive done the ice water bucket with my hands and feet.  It definitely helped after a few sessions over a couple days.  my hands still get cool sometimes but much less frequently and less cold.,BecomingTheIceman,dcf2zag,3,t5_2x9u1
