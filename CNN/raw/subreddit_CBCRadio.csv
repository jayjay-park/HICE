3691561,0,t1_cqcmkdn,I agree on the music discovery. I grew up in the s and enough.  Early in the morning I catch Nightstream  and there is a lot of good new and often Canadian music out there. Check the playlist if the hours are off for you. Currently loving Mo Kenneys I Faked It  to be truthful  the pleasure didnt last  before I took a drink  the ice had melted in the glass My radio goes on CBC in the morning and stays there till noon.
