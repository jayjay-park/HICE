741549,0,t1_cgokb6n,Too right mate. I honestly think its because memberships are too expensive for peoples age to attend Im in my low twenties and there arent many benefits to having a seat other than watching  home games. In addition a lot of older people have held their seats for over  years. Not much chance of getting a group of seats for you and your mates.Mind you with the night games a lot of people have not renewed their memberships.,GeelongCats,cgoki1g,1,t5_2tyvi
1082708,0,t1_chrcm27,I agree I think it is older people. Im quite loud and get told to be quiet by the people around me. I think that if you want to watch the footy in silence do so at home!,GeelongCats,chrcud0,3,t5_2tyvi

1584337,0,t3_2c1b8r,Center clearances are pretty bad were always getting smashed in the clearances. Hopefully they can get Lingy in as an assistant.,GeelongCats,cjevmem,1,t5_2tyvi
1671842,0,t1_cjmy3p4,Its a bit of a shame really. I like the general feel of rafl but the anti cats nonsense is a bit over the top on game day. ,GeelongCats,cjpwbjs,2,t5_2tyvi
2073610,0,t1_cl3ebix,Im not sure but I wouldnt want a draft pick. We have enough prospective  year olds. We need another reasonably established player. ,GeelongCats,cl3eggc,2,t5_2tyvi

2861547,0,t3_2svpjn,I like it good humour good to put stevie J in both sections. However I liked tracks varcoe he was one of our best in the  gf and has been troubled with injury since!I think the team has struggled with inconsistent performances. So many close games when really there shouldnt be.We rely too much on Tom Hawkins but when theres two talls up front he struggles to stand out. He needs the  to himself.A lot of young talent but our olds are starting to look slow. Hopefully the mix will be good.Also good call on Hamish but I think youre being a bit harsh. Can we get rid of the fuck off you flog?I like lighthearted stuff but being harsh and overconfident doesnt win us any favours.,GeelongCats,cntcy6r,2,t5_2tyvi
2863644,0,t3_2svpjn,What are our thoughts on Kersten.. I could have him in my Blast section. Struggles to get anywhere near the football. Or am I being to harsh on the kid?,GeelongCats,cntlirz,2,t5_2tyvi
3871671,0,t3_34s7rd,How bad was that umpire number  Foot? He seemed to pick everything up against Geelong but missed everything for us.,GeelongCats,cqxlr8w,1,t5_2tyvi
4727150,0,t3_3fl3vz,Didnt look like k at the game empty seats and the standing area was well below the limits. Are they counting the members who dont rock up too??,GeelongCats,ctqebn5,2,t5_2tyvi

7756187,0,t3_4ljhyj,Bartel was pretty good not many others.Disfunctional set up in the backline way too tall. Those fringe players are way behind those they are replacing menzel cocky and McCarthy are missed still no excuse. That was our best midfield and they got absolutely smashed by a midfield that lost probably their best very early on. Such a disappointing day!,GeelongCats,d3ntj4u,3,t5_2tyvi
8534475,0,t3_4wk5s1,After Adelaides massive win I was hoping we could do the same to the Bombers so we could get into the  club but clearly we were too wasteful...,GeelongCats,d68dic8,1,t5_2tyvi
8889538,0,t1_d7g9ao3,Evryone on the internet seems to be mad at Motlop. Were the commentators onto him for that? I thought it was the right choice at the right time.,GeelongCats,d7geacm,2,t5_2tyvi
8904032,0,t3_5284bo,Id like to think Adelaide as how well we played them both times this year but still cant right them off. Their forward line is unbelievable when firing. Sydney made us look stupid down at the cattery earlier in the year but Im confident if we play out best we can beat anyone. ,GeelongCats,d7i4woz,3,t5_2tyvi
9227749,0,t3_56phks,Well that ends the yearThanks to all the competitors.I know there was times where it couldve been done better and if Im the one that does it next year I know a few things Ill fix up.also second most score ,GeelongCats,d8lonyx,1,t5_2tyvi
