11209067,0,t1_df2ge1h,I dont think theres a single universalish rate for recombination which is the process through which HGT occurs. We do know that it happens a whole lot. Ill give you two three examples that illustrate how frequently it can happen. ampnbspFirst with viruses from my own work and the work of a labmate. We were trying to knock out a virus gene and then document the rate and spectrum of mutations that accumulate in the now nonfunctional region. To do this you have to grow the viruses in bacteria that are expressing the knockedout gene from a plasmid. Pretty straightforward. Except we couldnt get it to work because during an overnight growth of the knockout phage strains on the complimentary bacteria the plasmid and viral DNA would recombine and all of our viruses would be wildtype by the morning. Thats how fast the recombination HGT from the plasmid to the phage would happen.ampnbspI also have some experience working with fruit flies and they are a royal pain. To generate different specific strains with specific combinations of alleles you have to go through this process of mating specific mutant lines in the right order and finding the individuals with the traits you want after each mating. But once you have them they could be undone via recombination. So you have to use what are called balancer chromosomes chromosomes where a region is inverted to prevent recombination between the strains. Without these the yield of the combination of alleles you need together would be way too low to be useful. ampnbspAnd one more example because theyre my favorite There are a group of giant viruses the NCLDVs and some of the larger members have genomes that contain genes homologous to those in all three domains of life bacteria archaea eukarya. Its unlikely that these genes would look so similar to those in extant members of each domain if the viruses share a common ancestor with the common ancestor of all three so a better explanation is that they have been acquired from hosts via HGT over millions of years. ampnbspIn vertebrate genomes we see the effects of HGT everywhere. Endogeneous retroviruses ERVs are the remnants of viruses that integrated into our DNA then mutated and lost the ability to excise themselves and keep circulating. About  of our DNA is ERVs and they have all be acquired via HGT.We even have an example of a gene exapted from an ERV now used by apes including us during development. Its called syncytin and its critical for the early stages of development when the embryo attaches to the uterine wall. Theres also syncytin in humans and a number of similar proteins in other mammals acquired from retroviruses. Its thought that the acquisition of these proteins was a major step towards internal development rather than laying eggs. ampnbspOne more example of HGT one thats causing enormous problems Antibiotic resistance. Resistance genes are often found in two places plasmids which spread through populations via HGT and can recombine with bacterial chromosomes and viral genomes since you want to be able to keep your host alive even if there are antibiotics around that also frequently integrate andor recombine with the host chromosome. So via HGT from both bacteria frequently end up with resistance genes in their genomes. Written by Da,CreationExposed,df2j9s8,1,t5_3izdk
