199387,0,t1_cf158vd,For the auditing its required to keep track of user licensing if you so happen to have something like photoshop for the marketing person you wouldnt want to have that installed on multiple computers at once. I forgot about the XP computers that is a huge problem that will probably require a good write up if the pointy hairs are not technical. ,ITManagers,cf15hvl,1,t5_2tl26

3896528,0,t1_cr06haj,Sure  I would be happy to give you some background.  When I started the program I was ten years into my career married with a year old.  I had been contemplating going back for my MBA for at least  years at that point but I could never pull the trigger because I wasnt totally committed to the general MBA curriculum.  My undergrad was in Computer Science and I loved the technology side of IT.  I have two completely different career goals  Either be a CIOCTO or own my own business.My position at the time was as a Program Manager implementing largescale ERP systems.  I had a ton of exposure to the various businesses which added to my anxiety of a traditional MBA  I didnt want to venture further away from technology.  I had looked at a few other programs like the EMTM program at Penn but the travel and expense made it costprohibitive.  I found the ALM program at Harvard by accident  It popped up in a random Google search one day.  Once I read the curriculum course reviews and benefits of being a degree candidate I never looked back.I needed a parttime program as I have a family and was continuing to work fulltime.  I work in the Back Bay area of Boston and live in the suburbs so getting to Cambridge wasnt a challenge.  Being able to network with similar folks in my industry has been phenomenal and the coursesinstructors have been topnotch.My primary motivation for the ALM program was that I would get a good blend of technology material with business knowledge.  Im finishing up my th class this semester  Ive taken courses from cloudcomputing IT project management financial accounting networking design to web development.  I took an entrepreneurship class that had a semester long project to design your own startup idea complete with a simulated pitch presentation to a number of area VCs.  I also took Scott Bradners information governance class.  If his name doesnt sound familiar you should Google him  He basically founded the IEFT.The program has been exactly what I was looking for with the key distinction being what I was looking for.  I wanted to spend my time pursuing an advanced degree in the subject area that I was interested in and which would help with my career aspirations.  The question that I kept asking myself when deciding was How will I differentiate myself  years from now when everyone has a MBA.  I felt this program would help with that goal.  The resources have been great and I could easily justify the cost.Maybe its just how my career has progressed to this point but I dont feel my lack of business knowledge is or has been a hinderance in my career growth.  If you feel that is your major deficiency a MBA will help but ultimately its going to be up to your experience.  However if youre already in IT and your ultimate goal is to be a CTO I would be hesitant to suggest a program that will divert your attention from IT as much as a general MBA would.  I would look for programs that would give you both.Good luck and let me know if you have any other questions!NOTE  I see above that youre looking at the general management program at HES.  You could also look at the ALM in IT which will give you a good blend of Technology and Management especially if you load up your electives on the business topics.  ,ITManagers,cr0fsis,3,t5_2tl26

5900327,0,t3_3vywoy,Headcount ratios are not applicable without understanding expectations. It isnt users divided by IT staff. It is users multiplied by requirements divided by IT staff. With any resourcespending requirements you must link their expectations to your needs.There are  work hours a year. Map all your areas of responsibility over that time. Any processes and procedures required for ITAR. A fixed amount of project time and training time. Then divide the remain amount of time over the number of devices not users.I have won over a number of business owners by showing them we only have hr of tech time per year for each device we manage. Dont tell them why you need it ask them what they are willing to give up.,ITManagers,cxt2egt,1,t5_2tl26
6206954,0,t1_cyuqbb3,I dont think the devs should be the only client contact. That would be silly as they arent prepared for questions about financing or contracts for example.  But it makes perfect sense for the developer and the client to liaise directly on things which the developer will implement for the client.  This frequently requires additional work on the part of the development team  company in order to ensure that the client understands the value of having developers with them. Ive found it particularly effective when clients use the same Kanban boards as the developers and so prioritise work on the Kanban board while working with developers on individual cardsstories. The goal in doing this is to create a collaborative relationship where the goals of the developers delivering valuable software exactly match the goals of the client prioritise the most important and urgent features. By working from the same set of requirements and the same visible wall of work the client comes to understand what the conflicting priorities look like and the developers come to understand what it is that the client thinks is most important.  This doesnt work in an environment where everything is strictly worked to contract or in antagonistic environments or in waterfall projects. Its something thats particularly effective in collaborative agile development environments where the goal is deliver what the client needs not necessarily whats been specified in the contract. And that often requires a different sort of sales process.  In short its not a solution that works in isolation its part of a thought process and pattern of behavior that permeates both the client and vendor relationship.,ITManagers,cyv5x7j,1,t5_2tl26

6641996,0,t3_46kvxn,Time and date of ticket creation should be autocaptured of course. Username capture can be tied into AD or similar to autoextract things such as the users team cost center position and so on.Might be interesting to have a checkbox or field for when IT shouldnt have been called about the issue in the first place andor who the caller was referred to their chain of command HR maintenance switchboard advised to use noncompany resources etc. Useful for getting metrics on which areas of the company or which specific users are incorrectly wasting both their own time and Help Desk time and time is money due to not being trained on what I.T. does and does not cover. If they call and are on hold for any length of time theyre wasting their own teams employeehours. If any people are in the queue behind them while theyre talking theyre wasting the time of all those people in parallel.If your ticketing system can autocapture call data from your phone system too thats very useful. Get metrics on which callers or teams take the longest times on average per call or burn the most cumulative employeeminutes per call including delays for anyone behind them in the queue or tend to call at the busiest times of day and would generally experience much shorter wait times if they delayed any nonurgent calls to less busy times.,ITManagers,d06c8wo,1,t5_2tl26

IMO InfoTech stuff is very very good for  Project plans Templates Strategic planning docs Mgmt  Governance docsThey are medium good at Marketplace overviewsThey are not good at i.e. dont do to my knowledge Product benchmarkingDepending on the price offered I give them a strong recommend.

8729031,0,t3_4zh6j6,The old dont come to me with problems come to me with solutions is a good one for your team. Really if they are adequately skilled you should only be giving approvals and signoffs not involved in the day to day unless its critical. Give the guys full ownership and responsibility for tasks sink or swim. You might be surprised what they come up with. And delegate both down and up if the business demands are conflicting or unreasonable push back and make it their problem to decide what the priorities are and present an acceptable solution for you that protects your team and reputation. Set expectations about delivery but add  time and budget fudge factor to everything you do! If you deliver early you look good.But communicate this minute it and socialise the hell out of it!,ITManagers,d6wrtmb,1,t5_2tl26
