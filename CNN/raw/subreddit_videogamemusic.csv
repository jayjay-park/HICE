9864438,0,t3_5gmipg,Does anyone remember this weird game? I cant get it to run on my current computer so all I can do is listen to the surprisingly good soundtrack and thought Id share it with you!I imported the .mus files into Audacity via raw data import and upped the sound quality a bit from . Hz to . Hz  some high pass filter to give it some of its high frequencies back. I also had to split them into multiple files cause there were several songs in each .mus file some of them ending rather abruptly.Hope you like it!,videogamemusic,datcxhy,1,t5_2r9an
