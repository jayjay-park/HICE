Never had any problems with the characters or cutscenes the the voice acting could be laughably bad in some partsIt aged horribly because it was made in the late s. Find me one D game from that time that hasnt aged like shit. Judging games by todays technological standard is hardly fair. Super Mario World Sonic ampK Link to the Past. All those good games would be considered bad if they were released today but nobody judges them on that because its ridiculous to do so.,sonic,crfsy1a,-1,t5_2sm2s

6360000,0,t1_czc7k4v,gt When was there ever a question whether or not Michael Jackson did the music for Sonic ?Um forever?OPs article pushes the MJ did work on Sonic  and his work made it to the final game claim states it as fact but fails to provide any conclusive evidence. It doesnt even provide links to sources.Im still skeptical. I remember how people tried to construe links between Ice Cap and Smooth Criminal I never heard any above average similarity there for example until The Jetzons  Hard Times put an end to that. Proof that this was made by Buxer before he got to work for MJ even.Then theres the credits theme. Yes that really has above average similarities with Stranger in Moscow. But that doesnt mean MJ composed it. OPs article ends with the sentence The credits roll and Michael Jacksons music plays. No I say. Buxers music plays.From this interviewgt Black amp White In the studio Michael gave you a lot of freedom?gtgt Brad Buxer Absolutely. ...Sometimes he knew exactly what he wanted .... Other times he let me play until he heard something he likes. This is particularly what happened to songs like Who Is It or Stranger In Moscow.Its referred to a few more times in that interview. Reading a bit between the lines it sounds to me as if Buxer was either too humble or too loyal to outright claim full credit for whats essentially his musical composition not Jacksons.And sure Carnival Night Zone has a break that is note for note identical to one from MJs Jam. But apart from that the tracks are nothing alike and thats no proof of MJs involvement. Maybe one of his producers who really have worked on the game came up with that. Also CNZ isnt exactly a masterpiece of originality it cribs Entrance of the Gladiators the famous circus music. Do you know what other Sonic track uses a suspiciously similar cue? Mystic Cave! Coincidence or conspiracy? Music is full of common cliches motifs cues tropes whatever you want to call them. Its easy to find similarities even between unrelated pieces.Furthermore the claim that MJ wanted his name taken off the credits if they couldnt get the music to sound better on the console seems very fishy. MJ supposedly was a gamer and a fan of Sonic  and . He even had his own Moonwalker game. He must have known what sound quality the console was capable of. Or was he a moron who expected Sonic  to sound closer to CD quality than Sonic  quality? I doubt that.So people who believe that Michael Jackson made music for Sonic  and that its still in the game what tracks are you talking about? It cant be Ice Cap. Nor the credits theme. Marble Garden was by a Japanese composer IIRC. Maybe Carnival Night and Launch Base?,sonic,czck7ih,1,t5_2sm2s

6879834,0,t1_d0vqucr,I..... would like to know your thought process that led you to believe i said it was.Its not but undertale not a sonic game but releveant to topic due to following reason in a nutshell handled everything shadow wanted to do with its good vs evil motif  times better than shadow actually did. And did so with one developer. Shadow the hedgehog this is the game i am talking about thinks you can go darker and edgier just by swearing a few times and having the effects of your mission choices shown in poorly handled cutscenes.Undertale kicks it up to  by making you FEEL the consequences of your actions. Undertale only swears on the pure evil route because no one can tell if youre a being or a demon anymore and you can see the impact of your choices on the world and its npcs.  ,sonic,d0w56ym,1,t5_2sm2s

8370852,0,t3_4u6sty,I think if they dont call it generations  they should at least do something like Sonic Generations Resistance. They have classic sonic with modern sonic and the two eggmans eggmen? people are already linking it with generations and if they were smart theyd realize how many copies theyd sell by tying it in name to the most successful sonic game in a while I had tons of non sonic fan friends of mine picking up and loving the game.,sonic,d5nwn91,1,t5_2sm2s
8383446,0,t3_4ug4wl,So theres two ways to look at this.  The first is a more simple explanation they just reused assets to make a trailer for the game which would make sense.  But if you wanted to look at it through the story the trailer could be telling it could be pretty interesting!It looks like the robots are definitely automated versions of the death egg robot.  The classic single red eye AI look makes that very obvious.  It wouldnt make much sense for robotnik to just switch the head out all the robots he controls either show him or visually look like him.  Theres also three of them that we can see! and with the inclusion of classic sonic we can assume two robotniks and a third villian or just a robot.  Visually it seems pretty weird to have identical robots for each villain even though the point could be to hide the identities for now the red eye style makes AI much more likely.It seems like if classic sonic is in the game the story could be robotnik is taking all his old tech from the past and upgrading it to do more damage this time around.  It would make the game a big remix of past sonic game elements not just reimaginings of levels.But this might not be the case because this game apparently isnt a sequel to generations but really that could just be not accurate segas been a little off in the past with describing their games before release.,sonic,d5ph990,4,t5_2sm2s

8450939,0,t1_d5uotfx,yeah ive always called it powershielding due to being really into melee when i first got sonic mega collection. or for a short time super guarding a la paper mario. it was a really fun and useful advanced tech that allowed skilled players to keep the flow of the game going by not having to wait for attack cycles of some enemies like ones that eject and retract spikes or shoot projectiles. above all else i just hope they map super sonic to its own button. best feature of sonic  ep  and generations. ,sonic,d5xwjt0,1,t5_2sm2s
