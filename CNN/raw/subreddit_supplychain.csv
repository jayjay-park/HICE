2382817,0,t3_2mo3w6,Is it feasible for D printing to be commercialized?Of course its feasible.  Is it sustainable?  Will it contribute value?  The answers to these questions are one way to test its utility.Impact on businesses over the next  years or so?It really depends on what the application is.  Are you implying that D printing will be able to contribute to all manufacturing industries?  Could I print anything from an automobile component that is no longer being manufactured to a gel cap in the next  years?  If thats the case Im sure that D printing will follow most other technology and eventually find a place in peoples homes.  This would create a service industry around which supply chain professionals may find themselves as the intermediary between end users and materials providers.Govt regulations  ethical issues?This question makes me think about homebased craft beer brewing.  Im under the impression that in the US states have different laws which allow you to brew up to a certain volume for your own consumption.  I imagine there would be certain materials which you would not be allowed to use in a residential setting however if I recall one of the first things that was D printed was a plastic gun.  To paraphrase everyones favorite chaos theorist People uh find a way.Do you really want to be able to print everything you need?  Who do you go to for service issues or design improvements?  I wonder if CAD will gain in popularity..One of the main takeaways here is that D printing will allow business to do one of two things.  .  Adopt the technology into their production systems because it allows them to focus upon their core competencies.  .  The opposite.. companies will act as rd party manufacturing enterprises with quick turnaround times.  It will be very interesting to watch this grow... ,supplychain,cm68381,3,t5_2tcl6

7252339,0,t3_4em20i,There werent too many supply chain degrees a few years ago. So I imagine anyone above a certain age probably had to transition at some point. I know a lot of people who moved from operations to supply chain. Many others started as analysts and became supply chain people.Once you have the knowledge about how the business you are in works the transition is relatively easy. Without the business knowledge it is very tough.,supplychain,d22jeyt,1,t5_2tcl6

I am sure it is a combination of times when cashing out parking charge tip make model customer name and then probably some grouped revenue information.,supplychain,d6w7j5m,1,t5_2tcl6
