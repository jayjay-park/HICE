3036777,0,t1_coc09tj,In the original greedo didnt even shoot. The whole who shot first argument is silly because it should be why would greedo have a chance to shoot miss and then die? How does that a character make?,RPGhumor,cocrewf,1,t5_2tiww

10259659,0,t3_5mwlpy,I hope you dont mind me doing a copy and paste of a story Ive told previously... Also I hope you dont mind that the character in question had become an NPC just prior to his death... Still it is a story that must be told.This is a tale from the final session of the inaugural fivesession campaign of my very own RPG Straight to VHS which is centered on the following theme Bad Movies.I wont bore you with much about the events that lead up to our tale though this means well be skipping over Hombre De Espacio the raid at the sperm bank psychic operation of a motorcycle in order to distract a van full of ninjas and. . . well much else. . . But were here for the humiliating death of Theodore Albright. I must warn you the nature of this story may cause distress in those of delicate sensibilities or weak constitution. It is. . . not proper.First we must know who Theodore is. He was a PC played in sessions   and four. He was a beautiful drugdealing surfer dude who was dumb as a rock and who had earned the ire of fellow PC Ivy Proudmore by his being a hippie a nitwit and for selling a ton of weed to Ivys upuntilrecently estranged spacevampire father.So as these thing tend to go session four ends with everyone stowing away on the spermzombie sarcophagi which are being loaded into the Valopian mothership. With Theodores player having moved between session four and five its explained that his sarcophagi was loaded into a different room along with that of Ivys father and another NPC who Ill leave out for brevity. The PCs end up on the navigation deck where they have a showdown with the Valopian leaders. The PCs are victorious and they unlock the navigational controls so that they may send the ship crashing into the moon ending it all. But before they can celebrate. . .A slow clap is heard. Its Ivys recently unestranged space vampire father. . . turns out the PCs have been used as tends to happen. Now he can claim the ship as his own. . . and there. . . at his side. . . its Theodore though he looks to have been recently turned into a space vampire thrall.And so the actual final showdown commences. Its great. And Im surprised when the father is the first to fall leaving Theo as the very final baddie. Ivy attacks. . . and gets a critical hit! She has a choice of effect. She chooses. Oh my. . . Theos penis is shot clean off of his body fair readers. I warned you didnt I? Yes quite cruel of Ivy but you must remember that she never liked Theo and now he was trying to kill her and all. It should be said that Theodore was clinging to life by a fingernail.Theos turn came next. He goes for Ivy and. . . gets a critical failure! Theres only one thing for it ladies and gentlemen I steeled myself for the narration that the dice had laid before me. Ivy had shot off his dick and in painsoaked fury he goes to lunge at Ivy only to slip upon his own dismembered pud and fall forward his mouth wrapping around Ivys gun.In a roar hands held aloft the other players defer their turns to Ivy who tells the vampire to suck on this before granting her lead mercy upon him.Klaxons herald the imminent crash into the surface of the moon and a mad dash is made for the escape pods. From their capsules they watch it all shatter in unspeakable explosive spectacle as the campaign comes to a close. We had all bore witness to much at that table but among it all rest assured that Theo will be remembered. . . though perhaps not as he would like to be.,RPGhumor,dc6zlhk,5,t5_2tiww
