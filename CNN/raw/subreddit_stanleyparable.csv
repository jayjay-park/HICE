8470337,0,t1_d6032sw,In my particular interpretation all of the endings make sense if the narrator has this particular characterization  He has the power to change the story in any way he wishes but not to control your decisions  He really wants to have narrative control of the story and is threatened when you dont give it to him by making decisions that contradict his narration  Hes not particularly smart or in control emotionally. When he gets annoyed or mad at the player he starts acting based off of how hes feeling at the momentSo altogether the narrator doesnt set out to be an antagonist and hes certainly no evil mastermind. But when you get on his bad side  which is more often than not considering that you usually want to wrest control of the story away from him by making your own decisions  his short temper lack of foresight and complete omnipotence combine to make him a force to be reckoned with. Sometimes if youre lucky he throws a temper tantrum and makes you play a stupid game about a baby. Sometimes youre not so lucky and he blows you up with nukes.So again hes not deliberately your antagonist but the sheer amount of pain he can cause you just because you hurt his feelings a little makes him existentially terrifying in particular.,stanleyparable,d60byoj,5,t5_2yr3o
