11793666,0,t3_689svr,I would like to second that. As someone whos not familiar with any coding languages or what it really takes to pull something like this off what Im most impressed about is the way Etheroll has been received by the community. Several times Ive seen Etheroll mentioned as the best current showcase of an Ethereum dapp which is really quite something. ,etheroll,dgwuodi,3,t5_3f2sa
