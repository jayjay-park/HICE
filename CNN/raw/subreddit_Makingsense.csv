7787391,0,t1_d3q4bm6,gt The practical use of rationality is what you have made up showing scientifically your belief means showing what caused your belief or evidence which means sources.Rationality is the quality or state of being reasonable based on facts or reason. Rationality implies the conformity of ones beliefs with ones reasons to believe or of ones actions with ones reasons for action.? The act of having your reason for doing something is to effectively think about how and why you are doing something it literally is to have control over your actions.Another one. I also bold the specific parts that coincide most with my point. Abulof argues that rationality has become an essentially contested concept as its proper use inevitably involves endless disputes. He identifies four fronts for the disputes about the meaning of rationalityThe purpose or function of ascribing rationality Is it descriptiveexplanatory prescriptive or subjunctive rationality as if real?The subject of rationality What or who is rational the choice the act or the choosing actor?Cognition What is the quality of the cognitive decisionmaking process minimal calculative intentionality or optimal expectedutility?Rationale Is rationality merely instrumental that is agnostic about the logic of human action and its motivations instrumental rationality or does it substantially inform them substantive rationality focusing on material maximization?It is believed by some philosophers notably A. C. Grayling that a good rationale must be independent of emotions personal feelings or any kind of instincts. Any process of evaluation or analysis that may be called rational is expected to be highly objective logical and mechanical. If these minimum requirements are not satisfied i.e. if a person has been even slightly influenced by personal emotions feelings instincts or culturally specific moral codes and norms then the analysis may be termed irrational due to the injection of subjective bias.Modern cognitive science and neuroscience show that studying the role of emotion in mental function including topics ranging from flashes of scientific insight to making future plans that no human has ever satisfied this criterion except perhaps a person with no affective feelings for example an individual with a massively damaged amygdala or severe psychopathy. Thus such an idealized form of rationality is best exemplified by computers and not people. However scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of referenceRationality has different specialized meanings in economics sociology psychology evolutionary biology and political science.gt Of course words matter as well as the definition.Words do not matter only the information the words themselves represent. The word tree is entirely different in chinese its also entirely different in japanese arabic german english and so on. Does this change anything about the nature of the information they are describing no. So even if this was not the accepted definition it would still mean nothing in regards to my argument. The only thing that matters is the information not the labels you use to convey the information.Hence the reason why i asked you for your definition even if you had a completely different definition for rationality that doesnt coincide with the generally agreed upon definition. The only thing i would do is point out that your definition doesnt match the generally agreed upon definition for rationality. I would then suggest changing the word you use to describe the information you wish present to something else. But in the mean time i would simply agree to use your definition for the word when referencing to your arguments because i understand full and well that what we call something has no effect on the reality of that something.This is a common problem that comes along in debates essentially debating over nomenclature because people feel some validation in the specific word they use to describe their ideas. I think Richard Feynman puts it very well in this video If you do not know who Richard Feynman is he is one of the greatest known physicists in the world.With all of this said i think i will add another addition to my blog post regarding this to clear up any possible confusiondisputes someone may have regarding rationality.I think another interesting thing is how the Wikipedia article even mentions how essentially rationality may be something that only a computer would be able to perfectly achieve. Funny enough much of my blog is filled with ideas of essentially figuring out a way to interface the human brain directly with a computer. I never realized that such a want would coincide in such a deep way with a drive for rationality but the more i think about it the more it makes sense.If you dont mind i would also love if you took the time to read my blog post regarding the philosophy i created i call Rational Objectivism. Now thatthat is done lets go on to other things.You said this gt I cant find any theorem in probability theory that we should give up our emotions instincts or similar.This has come up in debates regarding my posts before some people even mentioned that we may not even be able to effectively function without our instincts.I think the point that you and others have had has some merit and may very well be true. Which is also why i mentioned in the blog post not only potentially getting rid our instincts but also potentially creating our own through manipulation our of neural processes. It may even be that overriding of instincts is a natural phenomenon and as we increase in intelligence as a species specifically through IA intelligence amplification we naturally gain more control of ourselves.gt How are they detrimental? They are not. There is no theory in probability giving validation to your claim. I specifically outlined how and why emotions can and have been detrimental to our well being by limiting cognitive abilities.as i said.The problem is instincts were made to deal with for the most part static environments environments that would not change for hundreds of thousands of years. Humans on the other hand change the environment constantly from an evolutionary perspective very rapidly. Far faster than any species can genetically evolve to keep up with. Hence the reason why most are going extinct when in the presence of humans.From this perspective we can start to see how our irrational emotions would not work well in our human made environments. Another detrimental effect of emotions is simply shown in debate debateargument only enhances our ability to look at the world from an objective stand point it hones cognitive processes. But it only does so best when bias is completely eliminated or at least attempted to be so. Many times people will simply become close minded entirely due to their emotions that are activating purely from the simple exchange of ideas. The emotions such as fear and anger developed to deal with situations where your life is being threatened are now being activated in situations where you are completely safe such as a debate. And they do nothing but hinder your ability to think clearly which is an extremely integral function to allowing you to be able to do something such as debate.gt Yes I see it now what is the point then? I assume you know you cant even get rid of your emotions or instincts by now. Yet you say we should strive for it.That is a possibility but just as we may not be able to understand everything yet we strive towards it relentlessly i think the same applies to gaining control over your own mental processes. It may not be possible to gain complete control but i think we should still strive towards it.,Makingsense,d3rcxyr,1,t5_3eoka
7797343,0,t3_4m2nt7,You is a subjective label which means its a kind of point of view. Person is a word which comes from Latin persona which means mask or actor. To understand this you must understand that I me is not YOU in the sense that it represents what you entirely are but rather I is the image we have of ourselves and our identity. Its not a full representation of the real thing by any means ,Makingsense,d3shbs3,2,t5_3eoka
7829178,0,t3_4miqin,Something that helped me was to think a few years back so i am not so emotionally attached to what i did. And then i try to analyze rational why i did what i did. If you go deep enough in the explanation you should find your core value.Hoped that helped you.,Makingsense,d3w2elq,1,t5_3eoka
7844468,0,t1_d3x4z7o,Ok now I completely lost it. First of all I still dont see any causal connection between Without evolution we would not even be here and Evolution is the purpose of all of our lifes. Can someone try to explain that to me again? Secondly it sounds a little dull to me to say that we evolved and now even have consciousnes just to realize that we should just do what we have been doing anyways meaning evolving. Which leads me to my third question. Evolution does not have any goal. It is just a very effective algorithm for life in a pre modern savage world as I understand it. So there is no need for evolution in the scientific meaning for humans anymore. So how can it even be a purpose?,Makingsense,d3xscum,1,t5_3eoka

8889441,0,t3_51zoc2,I have noticed this as well. For me its been less than a week but i see the difference its actually improved my relationships. I also feel much more connected to the Person im interacting with emotionally. i dont also get triggered by things i normally would. Its still bit of a process but ill get there ,Makingsense,d7gdv9v,1,t5_3eoka
8903270,0,t1_d7hgrup,I wasnt necessarily thinking about actionreaction on the surroundings but default deep feeling of connection to oneself and others.The third person perspective then would be just a logical step or reaction to the outside inputs then?Basically making the whole observer phenomena a reaction to the unfolding events in the universe   some sort of bug in the matrix. ,Makingsense,d7i1ma4,1,t5_3eoka

9830040,0,t3_5fvrkc,I can relate to you I had about the same doubts about my click and in logic which almost led me to unclicking. Just dropping the doubts and moving forward to make sense is really the best advice I can give although everybody needs to figure it out for themselves when struggling with doubts in logic. What helped me a lot is talking to people on discord that helped me get rid of my doubts. Keep up the momentum!,Makingsense,daovjcu,2,t5_3eoka

Im asking myself.It has probably been my way of persuasion. I dont know.Maybe perspective motivated typing.I think I have some permanent schizophrenia in me.,Makingsense,debfmyi,2,t5_3eoka
