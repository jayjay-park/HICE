8741338,0,t3_4zpw7x,Heard about them from people talking about them on Reddit specifically rSlipknot in some What else do you listen totype threads. Checked out Flying Whales and while its an amazing song it didnt really click the first few times. Tried listening to Terra Incognita straight through because at the time I liked to listen through a bands whole discography in order when getting into them. Really enjoyed Clone Space Time On the B.O.T.A. and a few other songs on the first few listens and continued listening to the albums in chronological order slowly fell in love with them.,gojira,d6ybhr8,1,t5_2tis5

9724048,0,t1_dabiu72, here you go! One thing of note is and Im assuming this because I havent played them yet on the Way of All Flesh vinyls the artwork corresponding with the slide they go in is what tells you which side it is. I thought that was really cool. Usually they just say Side ABCD.,gojira,dabp9rb,2,t5_2tis5
