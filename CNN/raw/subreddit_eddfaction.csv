609213,0,t3_20zve2,This will be discussed Sunday. I think we are ready to go. The committees will choose their representatives soon. As our main voting body hasnt changed very much I suspect little will change. There hasnt been enough time for power shifts within the mos so there are likely few new candidates. ,eddfaction,cg9iqh7,4,t5_2vle8

958330,0,t3_252oja,Great. Really hoping reddfaction amp the MOs rethink the other organization rules. Having affiliate organizations is a great way to group friends amp coworkers but they would obviously be considered a non reddfaction organization and would conflict with the current rules.,eddfaction,chd7yqt,1,t5_2vle8

1207504,1,t1_ci5fazq,I mean I wouldnt call you unbiased either. Youve been on a warpath to bring up negativity this entire time. Instead of voicing problems and offering solutions to those said problems all you have been doing is Look at how corrupt everyone is!And while Joe was factual he seemed to dance around the points that he cant argue.,eddfaction,ci5gny0,3,t5_2vle8

1224970,0,t1_ci5yefm,You can disagree but in a few months time youll come to understand why everyone is leaving.  PACT amp STAR have their shit together REDD is a fucking joke.  I know all the leaders of this thing you guys call a faction they have no experience as exemplified in spectacular fashion through recent events and are going to lead all your poor bastards into the deep void of irrelevancy.  TEST ASFL ULMC SCA and IEC all have the right idea.  Youd be fool to ignore the warning signs.  You think they are leaving over something small?  This mustve been building up for some time for them all to make an exit like this.  Use that thing between your ears noob.,eddfaction,ci7fea3,-4,t5_2vle8
