I know there were FP with the plugin with some of the bigger AV companies recently. Looks like you also have a lot of PuP open candy things. I would delete those definitely. Possibly look into another AV vendor to use on a flashdrive just as a double check. Might also sound like you use the same password for multiple accounts? I would change all the passwords to facebook email steam origin etc to be different. Enable two factor auth for as many accounts as possible and use a desktop password manager such as keepass or password. Try not to save passwords in your browser if at all possible because most PWS malware will look in default directories for chromemozillaIE origin steam etc. But from my research the foodloindotxyz doesnt have any malware associated with it on Virustotal. ,Malware,cw8i781,1,t5_2qrkp

As far as learning about exploits malware and other useful skills you have to tinker constantly. Learn some basic dynamic analysis and static analysis. Read about incident response and learn some forensics skills. Having a basic knowledge of InfoSec concepts staying current with trying to learn about vulns amp exploits a can do attitude and a desire to learn are the most important things.

Such things may not even exist.What probably happened is that the malware came out Windows Defender went new file on the hard drive time to scan and didnt like what it found.Recommend you learn the theory of how malware actually works before you start playing with live specimens. ,Malware,d9f0y0y,1,t5_2qrkp

Attackers love to monitor these public analysis sites to detect if the target s have detected their behavior. Malwr mentioned below is nothing more than a public Cuckoo Sandbox. I would highly recommend doing offline analysis when at all possible.  Then using artifacts from offline analysis to do passive research online. Build yourself a cuckoo Sandbox and pull down REMnux for starters.   Take this opportunity to learn some new tools.  Both of these tools are well supported and have a ton of documentation and videos to help you along the way. ,Malware,daajqmn,6,t5_2qrkp
9906322,0,t1_dayt2na,Well it was funny because it was a rhetorical question so your answer was funny to me...What hypervisr is saying is that the AVs look for a certain combination of of weird things. So if it changes startup thats one flag then it branches to see what else it does. Perhaps if it changes startup AND has code for file encryption AND moving THEN it signals that its malware...So basically everything is technically relevant to the AV it just has to be a certain sequencegroup of fishy traits to actually get flagged as a virus...Then again I dont think its THAT hard to trigger. Many legitimate program cracks for example dont hack you or do true harm to your system but an AV will throw a false positive about the gamecrack because its doing things that it thinks are harmful to your computer.any program that modifies other programs or is packed with various codehiding techniques is suspicious. That is extremely common for keygens cracks and other similar programs and that is detected by antiviruses.Hope this helps.
