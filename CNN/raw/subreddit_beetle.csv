277154,0,t3_1x9fw4,Try the other suggestions first as theyre going to be the cheaper end but I had a similar issue and after switching to electronic ignition and got rid of the points it went away completely. Also if its been sitting you might have a clogged fuel line underneath. Remove the gas lines on either side of the hard line and blow through it HARD with an air compressor to shoot out anything that might be clogging it up. And since youre down there replace all the soft lines and filter as well. The German braided lines are the best albeit more expensive. It takes some work to get these things in good order sometimes but once you get it going properly all it becomes is routine maintenance. Good luck!,beetle,cf9hn38,1,t5_2scbf

517548,0,t1_cfyy6qc,Thats an SVDA singlevacuumdualadvance distributor which I personally am a big fan of. Its important to note that with an SVDA one of your carb vacuum ports remains capped and that cap can be a source of vacuum problems. Ditto Id the vacuum line ends up connected to the wrong port. Id also make sure the vacuum line isnt kinked at all. All that said with the electrical thing it does seem like that could be the factor. Did you change your coil when you replaced your distributor? It certainly could be a warn out alternator or more likely voltage regulator. But before investing in a replacement youd want to do some good diagnostics and try to determine if youre leaking voltage somewhere in the system. ,beetle,cfz3ktm,1,t5_2scbf

The surcharge for a nonrunning car is typically an additional  tacked onto the shipping quote which can range from  and up depending on delivery distance from destination.

2190036,0,t3_2k4w6l,In most cases the seals fail not the cooler. Or the wrong seals are used for the cooler installed. There are several differences depending on the case youre using and the cooler youre using so if you get it wrong leak city. Early cases had an mm passage for the cooler and later cases had a mm. Seals are cheap buy a set of mm a set of mm and the to adapter seals theyre green. Then youre covered no matter what for about  bucks.Unless you can see some obvious damage Id bet on seals. A new cooler is about  bucks so you can replace the whole ball of wax and know its done. I guess it depends on what your time is worth to you if you get it wrong the first time and have to tear down again.FWIW in  years the only time Ive seen a cooler blow was due to foreign object damage fan exploding in the shroud something gets sucked in and punches through the cooler etc...

Verify this before starting out.   Dont back up with a towbard bug.  Or be real careful backing up.   You probably want safety chains.  Theyre a good idea as well as the law in some states and it sounds like youre passing through a few but most towbars dont come with them.

For the rest theres CIP Wolfsburg West Airhead parts and probably a dozen others.Heat is a controversial topic. I daily drove a  Super Beetle for  years and once it warmed up it was hot but that could take some time. The main reason was that a previous owner had removed the thermostat and cooling flaps. In fact on the  VWs Ive owned I havent had one where someone hadnt removed these. The solution to the heat problem is to not remove these parts or install them if theyve been removed by someone else.Cold starting Not a problem as long as everything is in tune. Later VWs have an automatic choke. One pump of the gas pedal primes the carb and closes the choke. As the engine warms up the choke turns off automatically. I never had an issue starting in the cold. It was quite fun to drive in the snow too. Its RWD but since the engine is in the back you still have lots of traction.One thing about beetles though is that you have to have some mechanical aptitude. Maintenance intervals are shorter than your Jeep. Oil is still every  miles but you have to check and adjust valves every . Its not hard but is has to be done with the engine cold.Standard beetles have a very simple suspension and steering system. As long as everything is lubed regularly it should last. Super Beetles while generally acknowledged as having superior comfort and handling as also more prone to failure. The super shimmies are a symptom of worn rubber bushings tierod ends and struts. All the parts are still available but its a lot more work to replace. I did the entire front end on my  but way too late to save the steering box.,beetle,cxsjbxn,1,t5_2scbf

You cant do a fancy stereo if thats your thing due to lack of juice. The conversion to alternator is also an option easy to do at home.  The only real parts you need for that are the different alternator stand and the  bug alternator ALN.  I did a write up Ive shared a few places on how to do the swap.  I reused the backing plate from my generator and everything else that they sell in the kits.  The stock version is amps they make up to amp rebuilds.  People will say buy Bosch new not rebuilds or Chinese.  Pretty much everything is made in China so there isnt a giant difference.

8046143,0,t1_d4kfzfi,I managed to get it idling on all s without any misfiring or backfiring. all plug gaps are at .mmquad checked and are all definatly firing pulled each plug out when it was running and heard the engine die down. I have tried syncing it with a motorcycle carb synch through the vaccum advance port. Do you think it would give me a bad reading? it does seem a little rough idle but it could also be the replacement cam. It seems to rev fine on idle and come back down without hesitation. When i took it for a test driveafter cam brake in etc. it was reving but not moving me very fast. i got into rd gear and it sat about kph around the k rpm range  where my  would be at about kph at least. After reading these responses im starting to really think towards it running way too lean but ill check when i get home from work and back at the car. ,beetle,d4kgnz8,1,t5_2scbf
8160807,0,t1_d4xjpae,I live in south Louisiana. Mine is a similar model in good cosmetic shape and we it got appraised for  a few years back. I remember a beetle being sold by me for  which was in much nicer shape than the one above and it wasnt a Super Beetle. Its not a terrible price if the engine is working but I have my doubts on that. ,beetle,d4xndbv,1,t5_2scbf
8258274,0,t1_d59r3yx,The reason I recommended a small screw diameter not length was so you could be sure the dab of JB weld didnt bleed over onto the carb housing when you press it in.  As long as you can see that youre not welding anything to the carb youre gold.,beetle,d59uap6,1,t5_2scbf

8498771,0,t1_d62gir7,I talked to Tim.  He can fix it but I have to ship it to him first.  He doesnt have any stock right now.  Its my daily driver so thats out which sucks.  I saw the Brosol on JBugs for  but Im hesitant to buy one because Ive never heard of them.  ,beetle,d63wc0w,1,t5_2scbf

9681569,0,t1_da6gcxy,I just want to change the fluid especially since it hasnt been done in  years.  But thats the thing though.  I cant find the filler nut.  I looked all over the tranny and I cant find the nut that Im supposed to put the nut driver into.  I think it was replaced by one of those two bolts sticking out the side but I want to make sure before I tear into something as complicated as the transmission. ,beetle,da6ghdl,1,t5_2scbf
10180729,0,t3_5lrgv9,The tail lights are a pretty good tell. They get bigger the newer they are same with the blinkers. The headlights change drastically in  from sloped ovals to flat and round.
