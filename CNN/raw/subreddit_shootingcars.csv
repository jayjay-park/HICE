492346,0,t3_1zokq2,An upvote to you sir.Id like to see an article about how you go about finding locations to shoot. Do you ever shoot on a location where you need to get permission from someone first and how you go about doing that etc...,shootingcars,cfw8elz,2,t5_2vyk5
492964,0,t1_cfw312h,This is what Im talking about. The guy uses a simple light source but any time I try to do similar it runs out really really weak.

975363,0,t3_258lhu,Im not one that thinks the rule of thirds is something you have to follow to make a good picture but it feels like not using it is working against you here. A center focused shot can be really interesting but I feel like the subject here lacks a place for my eyes to rest.Shooting through the wire is cool just dont know where to look basically,shootingcars,chf5oy8,2,t5_2vyk5

2370798,0,t1_cm4py8c,currently using a  . and a tokina . but since moving up to a FF camera the tokina has pretty much become useless. the picture posted in the link was taken with the mm but its not as versatile as i need it to be on these shoots. ,shootingcars,cm4qm87,1,t5_2vyk5

2972560,0,t1_co5y7a2,Shoot on cloudy or even better an overcast day. The overcast softens diffuses the light so that you dont get so much of that specular highlight.As far as angles... you just need to get down kinda low or climb a ladder... turn the wheel on the car. Anything to make it more interesting.You can use a couple of shop lights to light it up. Diffusion will help a lot. A white sheet in front of the light is a pretty good diffusion method.Dont set anything on fire with the lights. Its easy to do.,shootingcars,co5zuf8,1,t5_2vyk5

5920691,0,t3_3wce82,Very nice. That lighting is awesome. I might prefer a little bit of color just so there was some contrast between the grey car and grey floor. ,shootingcars,cxvqflo,2,t5_2vyk5
6151686,0,t1_cyopdnd,me too. I just dont bust out my DSLR for a CampC type event. ,shootingcars,cyovsf5,1,t5_2vyk5
6274656,0,t3_413k8l,Technically looks pretty damn good man!I think there a few attention to details you might want to watch out for when shooting cars for exampleYour driver side window is open. And you left the a gps or radar in the window with the suction cups. Also not sure if you can pop up the lights without them being on or not but if you look right under your driver light there is weird discoloration because of the light being on. Other then that looks awesome man!,shootingcars,cz2uvsw,2,t5_2vyk5
6603867,0,t1_d0296r0,Nope I shoot canon. And by identification I mean something to identify the photos subject like the badge. Not necessary but it can add a focal point rather than just lines. ,shootingcars,d02e7st,1,t5_2vyk5
6852562,0,t1_d0t0mx4,As in create a post for the album instead of just one pic? Dont use reddit much so im curious lol,shootingcars,d0t1o70,1,t5_2vyk5
7474882,0,t3_4hp5w5,Theres not really a set way to do it. Id say watch some videos on Youtube and get some ideas from them and then just really mess around with those bars in Lightroom until you get something you like.Heres a good video Heres another good one Heres one thats not really teaching much but is still interesting to watch I found all these by just searching Automotive Editing so Im sure you can find tons of videos and stuff that will help you.,shootingcars,d2rum6j,3,t5_2vyk5

8650482,0,t3_4ya3zx,This is a cool shot.  I really like the positioning of the car and the general composition.  The one thing I would have changed is the ambient light color in the background.  Its not terrible by any means I just dont personally like that color of light in night shots especially when your using flash.What was your lighting technique?,shootingcars,d6mx8u0,1,t5_2vyk5

11489459,0,t1_dfxm62w,Upvoted the OP post but yeah came here to also mention this as i feel like its important to critique. way too much Vignette. All of them would look way better without it. Try maybe just doing a mild vignette at the bottom of the photo leading towards the car on the first two shots. ,shootingcars,dfybuia,3,t5_2vyk5
