9404935,0,t3_59bpew,All updates should be cryptographically signed which is different than a mere file size check. As long as you dont override any badmissing signature warnings youll be fine.If you were downloading the updates over Tor which is likely then its possible you had a malicious exit node. No problem just wait  minutes for a new circuit to be built or do it manually by pressing n in torarm then try again.,Qubes,d98548s,1,t5_2shpk

9914629,0,t1_daztzao,Just wanted to let you know you are shadow banned on reddit.  Unless the mods approve your posts as I did here the only people who will be able to see them are admins and mods.You might want to contact the admins via rreddit.com to find out why you are shadow banned and if they will lift it.,Qubes,dazweny,1,t5_2shpk
10453172,0,t3_5pn2d8,Definitely not something with a recent NVidia card. AFAIK theres NO support for the x series in Qubes.,Qubes,dcsywg0,2,t5_2shpk
10610064,0,t1_dda07nr,mmh yeah I had problems while formatting the SD Card on debian before installing qubes so it might be correlated.. Anyway I was just trying to copy the password database plus other sensible files I know perfectly that it should be completely isolated!,Qubes,ddaci6a,1,t5_2shpk
10721906,0,t1_ddlb6ew,All the shortcuts for templates appvms and so on are showing just fine. Its the dom ones that are missing.There is no VM to shut down.,Qubes,ddlvvqv,1,t5_2shpk
10853675,0,t1_ddz76pp,Hmmm sorry youre having difficulties.. you shouldnt really need to ever reinstall the OS unless youve found thats the easiest way to start over lol.. otherwise there are backup tools to backuprestore your VMs.. Odd with additional NetVMs booting up causing problems are you sure none of the NetVMs are sharing PCI devices?  Each PCI device can only be shared to one running VM at a time.  Ive got a NetVM for my wifi and a separate one for my ethernet controller and they boot up normally at startup could you check to make sure you dont have any devices which appear in both NetVMs? ,Qubes,ddzha40,2,t5_2shpk
11220339,0,t3_602sye,I hope this doesnt come across as too blunt or patronising as it is not meant in that spirit!How familiar are you with linux? Qubes does require a reasonable understanding of the Qubes OS itself and linux in general fedora and debian are particularly useful when dealing with VMs and being comfortable with the console is pretty much essential for at least the setup. Some of your questions seem to indicate that you are not very familiar with Linux and qubes might be a difficult place to jump in. I commend your choice of OS but as a fairly Linux savvy user I still hit rough patches from time to time. If you havent already I would recommend getting very familiar with a simpler Linux OS before trying qubes and then reading all the qubes literature you can twice for preference. I am not joking and I dont mean this in a harsh way qubes is getting more user friendly with each release but it is not perfect yet and a lot of problems can be solved by examining the documentation and understanding what you are trying to do. Dont get me wrong we all need help from time to time but people will likely feel more inclined if you can express the issue clearly and accurately and show you have tried to address the problem yourself plus youll understand how to implement the solutions you are asking for help with finding.The community is helpful but they dont owe you an answer to every question particularly not ones that are answered in the documentation or are not qubes specific issues but things you can learn elsewhere. Long lists like this one are not much fun to try and answer even if every question was qubes specific and undocumented.I dont mean this harshly but the answer to a lot of your questions is read the documentation or check out the mailing list. It is the way to go for find the solution to a lot of problems. Any that are unique to you are ones that you will have to try and solve yourself people will often offer helpful suggestions or point you in the right direction but the documentation likely doesnt exist for your exact issue and your exact setup so you have to be able to adapt and improvise a bit. It is quite possible that some good samaritan with more free time than myself will try to help you work through these issues and questions but I wouldnt hold your breath tbh.,Qubes,df3t7yy,2,t5_2shpk
11393296,0,t3_62kq5m,As Im not using Qubes myself yet I can only say what I think however take my words with a grain of salt.In Qubes basically everything runs in a VM. The standard apps  VMs are Fedora ones. Afaik for networking there are special VMs which can be used by others for routing the network traffic. So it should be sufficient to create one such networking VM with a configured VPN to PIA and then use this for networking for all other VMs.For Fedora theres not really a PIA client but they utilize OpenVPN. Just search on the PIA site for something like OpenVPN Fedora then you should find a guide for setting up PIA for Fedora. However for me this is not working well right now. I have quite some connection issues. However I dont know if this is a problem just with my setup or with the openvpn solution in general. I already submitted a support ticket but havent received a reply yet.Again Im not  sure on how VPNs work in Qubes so you might also want to hear others.,Qubes,dfnewts,1,t5_2shpk
11479264,0,t1_dfwssfq,Qubes is mainly designed to mitigate remote exploitation. Unless you choose to use a laughably weak passphrase why are you concerned about offline attacks? A keyfile on a security device is much easier to steal from your desk or car than a passphrase from your head. And a good passphrase isnt much easier to brute force. At least not for actors who dont have unlimited means or are willing to use a rubber hose.So yes I would say Qubes is reasonably secure.,Qubes,dfx666n,2,t5_2shpk

11634005,0,t3_660p52,Yes. It worked on mine without having to install anything. ,Qubes,dgeq6my,1,t5_2shpk
11744296,0,t3_67ezgz,I update frequently and rarely have issues. The only issue I can think of was when I moved to Debian Stretch. There was a problem with audio but someone already found a fix.Edit If you are worried about your template you could just use the builtin backup utility.,Qubes,dgr8uvn,1,t5_2shpk
