11514,0,t1_cefojdr,Severely burnt down syndrome kid? Why? DWhile Bens fast movements had good intentions instead of falling forward Rukia swayed backwards landing in an ungraceful heap on the ground. Confused by the sudden change in scenery she clawed at the ground for a few moments before pushing herself up to a sitting positioning squinting again upon seeing Ben.Then her eyes widened again with alarm. BETROTHED BETROTHED! ITS STILL THERE! ILL HELP YOU KILL IT!And with that she rises unsteadily towards her feet drawing out her Zanpakut with clumsy hands. Jusstay very still... she cautioned hiccuping slightly as she advanced towards him.,Seireitei,cefquio,1,t5_2w82b

58796,0,t1_cel2omt,Mami looked at the Captain Commander and could see the anger in her eyes which hurt the small clumsy girl a fair bit perhaps more than Rukias slap had.  Mami really admired the Captain Commander finding the idea of a person of even lesser stature than her being so strong simply amazing.  She had sobered up enough by this point to know that she had hurt the Captain Commander earlier so Mami couldnt blame the older woman for being upset.But then Rukia turned her attention to the people around them and it occurred to the intoxicated Mami that the Captain Commander was upset at the Audience.  But they were the ones that told me how to help you Mami said without thinking not noticing the many people motioning at her to not say anything.  She just knew that they were good people.  Sadly her drunken state had made the small woman even more Nave than usual.  Which is actually a somewhat impressive feat.The shinigami that had come forward to explain things bowed to the captain Commander and moved next to Mami helping her up.  Mami followed his lead not really thinking about it at the moment.  The man looked at his comrades apologetically and wondered if he should find a place that would be out of firing range.  He was not entirely sure how Rukia would take out her anger on the other members of the Eleventh Division but he thought it best that he and Mami not be in the middle of it.When Rukia apologized Mami smiled brightly Oh Im fine... I get hit in the head a LOT so its not that big of a deal she said just happy that Rukia wasnt upset at her.  In fact she almost felt like singing but no song came into her slightly addled mind so she simply remained quiet for the time being.  ,Seireitei,cel4hzn,1,t5_2w82b
71349,0,t1_cemjb7v,Kabuza had shot the Shakkaho not only as a weak offensive but also as a momentary distraction as he switched locations to a tree several meters left. And just in time as the retaliating Kido had blown a hole straight through the tree with a bloodcurdling crackle leaving only a charred stump. Yep that Kido was meant to kill. If the fight was like that then Kabuza would not hold back like he had with the first attack.This time rather than muttering Kabuza shunpos out from his hiding place and appears directly to Zemaiahs left crouching down in an attempt to sweep his legs out from under him. He didnt speak or even grunt but rather acted as quickly and silently as possible in an attempt to keep Zemaiah from detecting him for as long as possible.

He shuffled lightly and brought his hands up behind his head. That sounds rather impressive to be honest Im glad you were able to find people who were able to appreciate the sacrifices of our brothers and sisters. I hadnt thought about that actually it would be a good idea to use what we can.

130105,0,t1_cet85yq,Jeisen does finger touches with his left hand to make sure everything was working right as he rubbed the back of his head with his right handThey were weak by the time they had hit me. Was too fast for the other ones but this one was a lucky shot. And that the bandages I have on right now arent as good as some of the others. Like I said these take fine control and some skill to make. If you take the weaves and apply them better then these were it simply works better. Jeisen shrugs. He didnt know why this was a deep conversation about the bandages. They were good but like a lot of ideas Jeisen had need more work.I want to make them act more as conducts for kido amplifying their power then caring out a residual healing well after the initial one. But from my basic work they became exponentially more difficult to make and I feared they could possible amplify any kido. Meaning in a battle they would actually increase the damage from a kido or cero attack. There was also the problem of them over healing and sealing into the skin I hadnt rested that part out yet though. But like I said these ones right here or just stop gap measures. They dont work on all wound like poisionings. They need some work before Id say they were really well made.,Seireitei,cet8xdj,1,t5_2w82b

We havent decided in either direction of soft or hard stats and I in fact specifically remember you being someone who said a VERY simple soft stat system that was similar to ours was too difficult. So its kind of difficult on our part to fix problems when things are too hard for anyone to understand. gtAt the moment were working on both a balance patch for the current system and a different system that works off hard stats. Once both are complete well make another post about them so people can decide which theyd like.Relax a little there is no selected stat system we will talk to the community when we have ANYTHING concrete that we seriously want to present. Like I said to Panda obviously the stats havent changed nor have we given the community a serious proposal. Dont make a big deal out of a nonissue.

Ryatso could feel the heat of the morning sun through his eyes and all over his face. He opened his eyes and realized that he was still laying in the grass with Aoi.

541175,0,t1_cg1q3j4,Yoru was doing better with Caomei since he had much more time to get adjusted to his life and having a son that she had gifted him with. Sure he sometimes missed her and visited her grave a bit more and saw the one that he suspected to be her reincarnation occasionally but he kept his distance from her. She was in her own new life so he shouldnt bother to try and intervene in that one. It wasnt his place. Though Hikaru was able to easily identify her since he came from her as well. Hikaru might tend to stick to her a couple of times. The most I can remember back then was Caomei throwing a few rocks at me here and there but it was mostly for fun. She had a mean throw herself Yoru said in remembrance. Listening to Ryuuhei talk about Val Yoru could understand the logic behind that but still had a bad feeling about that guy. Yoru couldnt explain it but Val just rubbed Yoru the wrong way. Maybe he was just being paranoid about it but it couldnt hurt to keep tabs on him now could it? If you are willing to trust him I guess I can give him the benefit of the doubt but Ill still keep my eye on him Yoru said. Although that was easier said than done. He wasnt exactly easy to track without him catching on. Most likely Yoru would need to try to be smart if he wanted to do anything. Well that would have to come a little later.

885538,0,t1_ch4lb0z,Shin nods at Mal. At least hell have some time. He was sure he could at least convince a few of those in Central  to sanction the mission. Especially those who had an affinity for the Omnitsukido and its operations as it would be right up their alley. Not to mention that the Omnitsukido was technically a corps of itself and only aligned with the Gotei  because the leader has generally been a member of it.No I dont think we should particularly trust him yet. He might still have allies back there he was forced to leave. We dont want him to tip our hand just yet.He listens in on Mals plan intently. It was bold. Crazy as fuck to be perfectly honest but if these young captains and lieutenant were going to go Shin felt obligated to protect them. He didnt want  hours to pass and lose these Shinigami. He did seem to have it planned out properly however. He could bring that much information to the members of Central . Mal was definitely prepared as Shin looks towards the duffels. He gives a confident nod towards Mal and the others.Ill be there.Shin looks into the duffel and stares in utter shock at Mal.Dude where are the Doritos!?He sighs.

The sound of steel on steel resonates throughout the area as his blade meets the pincers of the scorpion able to stop its assault but dealing no visible damage to the hollow. It jumps back readying another assault when the sand below Ryuuma begins to soften and he starts to sink into the earth. A disruption in the earth circles him causing the sand to feel softer and softer under his feet.

The smallest captain bit her lip not wanting to draw attention to herself but... there was something that people seemed to have forgotten something But we barely survived the last war she blurted out without thinking.   It was very hard for the girl to cover up her embarrassment at her outburst but she managed somehow.   Another war regardless of who it is with could destroy us... and Im not sure it matters if we won or lost she said although that was simply an idea a theory... would she be able to back it up if pressed?   To be honest she would rather not have to find out.However... it is not our duty to destroy them... the opposite I think... wed be betraying that duty if we went to war she said the words coming out on instinct to be immediately replaced by an inner terror of questioning a senior captain in public... although again she managed to keep all signs of those emotions to herself.,Seireitei,chl7432,1,t5_2w82b
1028967,0,t1_chl8l22,Okay wow. Ren was amazed that Ryatso really acted like he knew anything about the law there and told Ren that he had to learn. Ren never was one to dislike someone a great deal but this man he was genuinely pushing it with his talk and how he was acting like he could do anything he wanted. He didnt say anything though due to Captain Shin Kobayashi making his statement there and Ren knew that he couldnot interrupt the man as now it was Shins turn to speak. Shin was... pretty much defending Yoru there. Yorus life was being safeguarded by this man right now and Ren was certainly glad that this was happening. It was one thing that Ren was taking on several people that were attempting to have Yoru killed from treason but another to be the only one there trying to prevent it from happening but now Ren was glad that he had some assistance that was helping him out. As Shin has stated only a few ways are to be settled. Yoru is to be relinquished from the th Division as a transfer or we can continue this further that will get nowhere. There is however how Yoru and Ryatso may be permitted to battle for the position of Captain if it is in agreement with others only. But aside from that the need to stand trial here with execution rather than transfer as should be the case to be the most likely of cases. The defense will rest here Ren stated and Yoru wondered how this was gonna go down. Guess Ren stating his past actions does help him out but transfer Divisions? Yoru didnt know if he would ever be able to agree with that but that might very well be his only chance in this trial. He could only trust in Rens judgment. ,Seireitei,chl8zg8,1,t5_2w82b

Limiting the movements of the civilians will allow us to more easily detect movements of any enemy forces...and I must request that at least five of your airships remain on station above Seireitei in order to visually scan the area around the walls in case the Espada have developed some technology to hide their presence from our scanning measures.

He didnt think hed want to do something as deep as that. He smiled gratefully at Mal that he would be that considerate. But now he wondered if that would be the right thing... or perhaps may have looked like favoritism. Or worse yet might have been insulting to Tsukine to suggest she leave her post. They did have a few other children to look after. When it came to his and Lorcians family Tsukine was always the nd matriarch. The rest of the family would look to her if Shin or Lorcian were called away.

Then again focusing purely on kido can cause you to be taken out by some of the weakest of sword fighters in the end its risk vs reward. Sure there is more to it such as speed of individuals and even intelligence in battle... I guess thats why the academy needs to be attended before you join a squad without being at least on na set level with all of these you wont stand a chance against some enemies.Saria walked over to one of the walls and leaned against it.

I will do what I can to defend this place from a pressing threat but as it stands there may be more than one.

He was tired worn thin by worry and the war of responsibility hed been fighting with himself. I know that you have the best interests of your family at heart you always have and that is why Im doing this. I dont believe for a moment that you would forgive me if my duty required that I take your family from you and I would not forgive myself. I can no longer balance the law of the Gotei and my personal feelings. I cannot hold this position any longer. The law demands things of me that I cannot bring myself to do and that alone makes me unfit the added benefit of refuting Shinyas lies and allowing me to work from outside are not the reason this must happen.Mal ran his hand through his hair frustration driving him to shake his head.You said earlier that you did what you had to for Shinya to trust you and I must ask you to do that now. If he believes that I no longer hunt him and that you control the systems that were tracking him he may slip up. You can always contact me using these wonderful creatures the iDragons are so convenient but this is how it must be.

Why wasnt he in squad ?! Seriously. Shins grin starts to fade as he muses over Shinyas true intentions. What she was saying made sense when it came to Panda through and through. But the rest of them? Shin was still not convinced. Then he nods when she describes her worries about Mal.To be perfectly honest I share your exact feelings on Mal as well. Hes been on a ruinous path of revenge over Shinya.Shin shakes his head solemnly. He knew Mals main reasons for resigning was because he didnt want to be put in the position of potentially arresting Lorcian. However he couldnt really tell Sumiko that.Unfortunately it feels more and more like hes just proving Shinyas accusations to the public... I worry about him. So far I havent been given any pressure to arrest him despite him deserting the Gotei  in a time of war. Right now Ive got him under surveillance for his own protection.Shin smiles at Sumiko. She was one of the more brilliant minds in Seireitei along with his wife. It wasnt so much that Shin trusted her as he felt that their goals may be similar with the way she was talking.I havent pursued Shinya under the guise of prioritizing the arrancar threat. However some of his accusations alarmed me. All in all Im just waiting to see Shinyas final intentions... and leaving Mal alone is simply a check to ensure Shinya doesnt push too hard too fast. Still... I would feel better if there was someone watching over Shinya also. To make sure he doesnt get in over his head. OOC Or head over heels!Shin smiles and gives Sumiko a hard stare. He remembers his chat with Shinya when he had captured Tsukine. Shinya had offered Shin a chance to pledge his loyalty to his unknown cause it almost felt like an old s Space Odyssey.Im glad I have your confidence.

1735552,0,t1_cjxxbn3,I just had a brilliant idea. Hollows are just souls that faded away without being konsod because they had regrets and anger toward the world which left them with their hole. Chi happens to already have a pure manifestation of the regrets and anger of  Shinigami that died to create him. I already had some stuff planned for Oni but him turning out to be a Hollow could be interesting...,Seireitei,cjxxiio,1,t5_2w82b
1747969,0,t1_cjzh5um,Saria was glad to see someone show up that seemed to know somewhat of what they were doing. Then again she couldnt be too sure how it would turn out in the end. She seemed to have a Mercutio lined up for the play. Glad to have you Im Saria. Im glad you are prepared as this whole rehearsal was a lie I sorta left this assignment to the last minute so its the actual play tonight. Saria let out an awkward laughBut that should be the best part of playing Tybalt getting to take down Romeos gay lover Saria said somewhat in character.Saria crossed a role off the list although curtain call was coming up fast a few more people showed up she shrugged as she gave the others a quick overview so they could get started with the play in the first scene.Also can I ask people to try their best to keep to  thread.

He did what he was told to for the assignment but not much else. What Yujiro didnt know is that since he was on stage that one time he had become a bit of a legend among the student actors someone able to follow stage directions to the smallest detail memorize lines perfectly after one reading and take on any persona required of him.The red haired young man calmly waves at Saria. Hey there. Thought Id show up and wish you guys luck. Actings hard I guess.,Seireitei,cjzz4kh,1,t5_2w82b
1761081,0,t1_ck12gbs,Chi had warned Shin that Yamashita was going to have a talk with him. Not arrest him but he would hold Shin for questioning. Well... well see about that. Shin was rather curious as to how it was going to turn out really. Was there going to be an armed guard? If there were it was probably just for show as Shin was fairly confident he could neutralize anything that came for him. But that was only if they decided to take drastic measures in order to restrain him or keep him somewhere. He had to rescue Lorcian and this was not something he could simply delay. He had to ensure that if he went after her it would not endanger his family here.Shin was greatly hoping that Yamashita would listen to reason. He had talked with him earlier and knew the man to have sound judgement. Now it was only a matter of seeing how things went. Shin didnt want to do anything illegal... but he would if he had to. Or ... at least bend the rules a bit. He was notified of Chisato at the gate of the manor which surprised him greatly.Shin goes out to meet Chisato and politely opens the gate himself waving off the gaurds with a smile. He was expecting Yamashita. He wondered if Yama decided to send Chisato just because she was an attractive woman lieutenant and knew Shin would not wish to hurt her.Pleasure to see ya Chisatosan. Been a while since the last time. He makes an obvious reference to noticing her during the whole tussle with the arrancar in the Rukon.I see youre here for somethin formal though?But... but...

1887834,0,t3_2g8l23,Sumiko walks through the streets observing the people she meets. Suddenly she could hear the voice of a man having a onesided conversation. She turned the corner and saw him talking to no one in particular. Hmm it seemed as if there was another shinigami who talked aloud to his spirit just like many of the new recruits. When would they learn that they could respond in their head? Or better yet just tune out the voice of their zanpakuto spirit?Then again Sumiko realized she had an unfair advantage when it came to tuning out voices in her head. She had them since she was a child and she had many of them. She wouldve gone crazy if she hadnt mentally silenced them as soon as she did or maybe she didnt manage it soon enough? Others would definitely say she was crazy...Show? Show who? And how?Sumiko steps closer to the man keeping her reiatsu lower than some of the new recruits. Thankfully shed not worn her Lieutenants armband today as she had wanted to see how people who didnt know her would act. She keeps her disposition warm and smiles naively pushing away her hatred of naivet. She would test this man.What are you going to do? I wanna watch! Its going to be so much fun isnt it?

1901334,0,t1_ckfqutu,As soon as her heard the release command uttered he knew that the man was a shinigami the morphing of his blade as obscene as it was only confirmed the fact. He couldnt help but sigh at the blades shape it certainly did not befit a king and Cameron was tempted to ask if he was overcompensating for something although those words would most likely be taken poorly by the king So you are something other than human at least part shinigami to be able to release and change a swords shape like that.Cameron had met a fair few shinigami before they also tended to take out the hollows that ravaged his kingdom but it became in unneeded as Cameron became king he was able to hire animals to watch over his land they seemed to be quite in tune with the dead and were able to see the hollows so both the deadliness and eyes of his creatures made them great advisers. Your weapon is interesting. Cameron decided to leave it at that it was a word that could be used for most zanpakutou so he wasnt exactly speaking out of line Raise your dongers XD,Seireitei,ckiaskn,1,t5_2w82b
1907334,0,t1_ckikysq,You dont know my name. I never told you what it was.Kuraichi resigned himself to his fate. She was a just another privileged snotnosed student in the academy which provided his food board and books. Students were like bee stings unnecessary facts of life that were inevitable if you wanted the honey of knowledge.Still it was flattering that the professor had asked him to teach as if he was a professor himself. Few students had individual faculty tutors and when they did it was either the prodigies or extremely rich who garnered the special treatment. Kuraichi glanced at the lesson objectives handed to him by last weeks instructor and gave a short whistle. The girl was learning quickly and had already surpassed her peers in the second year advanced class. Regardless this had probably done little to temper her holierthanthou demeanor. Just hold it in Kuraichi. Who knows? If you do well here you might get a promotion. Maybe your own research opportunities. That would certainly help for a cripple hoping to apply for Division It was little compensation for working with a brat albeit a clever one. She would gaze at him with contempt as she learned kido after kido forgetting the one that had fried her scalp last summer and see in him only a student who had never graduated a failure who wore bangles and black nail polish. As he opened the door he remembered that the black eye shadow he customarily wore was absent from his face. Probably the effect of a rushed morning. He wondered if she would recognize him without it.,Seireitei,ckj0smp,1,t5_2w82b
1909070,0,t3_2ghk01,The atmosphere contained an air of emptiness as Kazuya walks down the overgrown path towards the main tower. This squad had been Kazuyas first step into the ranks of the gotei thirteen and to see what was once a hive of activity reduced to this state was heartbreaking.How... How could things have deteriorated to this in just  years?Having only just returned to the Seireitei after five years. Kazuya had decided to go round to the rest of the divisions and reintroduce himself as the lieutenant of squad four. However he had not expected to see his former squad to be in such a state of disarray.I guess I should find whoevers in charge around here if anyone.Sensing a long riatsu atop the largest spire. Kazuya makes his way to the top coming out behind Cong. Seeing no haori or badge Kazuya decides hes not talking to a captain or fellow lieutenant. He introduces himself.Excuse me.

He leaned forward and set his sandwich on the plate hed brought.You must have been really tired. Seems like you might have been pushing a little too hard recently.Matt made the observation in a friendly uncritical tone and took a sip from his water. Looking over at Kavela he saw how shed essentially curled herself into a ball a defensive sort of reaction. Maybe he hadnt cracked her shell yet. Chi was just checking up on me. He was really helpful with the dojo most of the floor supports well all of them are cut and placed. We even set the frame for the pillars on the corners with Chihanas help. I think if I let them theyd have done all the work for us.Matt chuckled softly at that last comment he didnt really want to explain why he wanted the two of them to do it themselves because Kavela might see it as being critical of her earlier training and it wasnt that at all.Eat up we have an afternoon of work ahead of us.,Seireitei,ckl646o,1,t5_2w82b

1976772,0,t3_2h93jq,Mami had the strangest feeling of deja vu as she walked through the hospital intent on finding a certain room although the small captain couldnt quite place why that was...   Something felt very familiar about this situation but Mami couldnt quite place why.  It wasnt even something she had experienced... but it still felt like something that Mami had gone through before...Oh well that wasnt anything she would need to worry about right now really.  All that mattered was the news that Mami had received regarding a certain patient here.      Mami nodded to the nurses that bowed to the small captain accepting a clipboard from one before she was lead into the room she wanted Thank you Miss she said to the nurse before she peaked in on the injured member of the Thirteenth Division Hello Araisan... may I come in? she asked biting her lip slightly.   she had been very upset to learn that the girl had been injured... the thirteenth had been Mamis family for some time and everyone in it was so important to her.    The small captain stood at the doorway waiting patiently for Aniko to either accept or deny Mamis request for entry examing the clipboard silently as she did.   Reiatsu exhaustion... Mami muttered again getting a feeling that she had been through this before somehow...,Seireitei,ckreg6c,1,t5_2w82b
2045890,0,t1_ckzoqae,Mami nodded and moved to a changing room as well following the younger girls lead for now.  Mami always felt self conscious when she had to take her clothes off around others so she quickly tied a large towel around herself not even needing Aniko to set the example on this much at least.   From her neck Mami pulled a simple necklace   Two small cube shaped crystals and a single white feather...  Nothing to extravagant but the small captain looked at it a mixture of sadness and fondness on her face before she lay it along side the rest of her things.As the small woman got into the bath her dual collared hair still in its braid Mami sighed happily the water felt wonderful.    For a time she remained quiet but kept glancing at Aniko curiously ... What was life like for you?  Before you joined the Gotei Thirteen? Mami asked curiously.   Shed just come out and say it.  It may be rude but she wanted to know more about her odd little assistant.  The curiousity was driving her crazy.I know the feather is black in the link but this is the closest thing I could find to what I had in mind... oh well.,Seireitei,ckzvm95,1,t5_2w82b

He probably did owe Chi an explanation now. Fine. I will tell you.He looked at him and stuck his blade in the sand below them. I was fighting a Vasto Lorde in the Human Realm a few months or so back he paused for a second. I beat it but I was broken. Then came the moment I met Laxus Alosar. He watched over my practically dead body and laughed. He gave another sigh. He helped me get back to the Seireitei with a serum which reinforced my bones temporarily but he also put in a disease one which made marks spread over my arms and shoulders and prevents me from channeling Reiatsu in said places. You should curse him if he didnt show up you would be wearing this coat and I would be dead.He then chuckled slightly and shook his head. Anyway.. the Captains know about my Zanpakut and the very destructive power of my Bankai. It is not all about Zanpakut and Bankai but about experience as I just told you. There is a way to fix it Laxus informed me. I need to make a vaccine with the base containing his blood and inject it into my bloodstream. Mami should be working on it right now.

If you want to know a real secret that you should be worrying about then perhaps I can tell you. My only condition is that you promise to listen with an open mind and yknow not try to kill me. And just to clarify the only reason that Chikaku is primed is because Captain Ritsu is avoiding protocol by trying to slaughter me instead of interrogate me. Hardly fair I think its  literally against the law itself. Well this way he will have to listen to me. Thats all I bear no ill will to Seireitei.Bringing his arms back to rest on the table and tries to catch Mamis eyes. He holds a stare his blue eyes gazing intently at her.Tell me how are you handling taking over Squad ? It will always keep a place in my heart even though my Captaincy was brief before moving to my true home of Squad .

Almost comically Touka sucks it into their mouth and chews it down tears hitting the corner of their eyes then offering a nervous and slightly embarrassed smile back.I think... Touka coughs a little still choking slightly on the sweet bun. everyone is gone to register for a division or... lunch...Talking about lunch after only having a sweet bun for breakfast Touka became slightly disillusioned by the idea of having red bean rice balls chocolate milk and rock candy for their meal.
