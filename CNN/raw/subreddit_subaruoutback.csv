The beeps can be customized for lane departure warning collision detection and front vehicle moved.Other customization includes. Door unlock behavior. Open all doors if passenger or driver side door opened. I have mine to open all if passenger opened and not to open all if driver side opened. Can also be done for cargo door.. Dome lights when door opened. Keep it on till closed or turn them on temporarily. Applies to the rear cargo too.The above customization can only be done when car is in parked position. And those who have keyless to keep sound playing but turn off engine while waiting for someone turn off the engine when car is in neutral or drive.And I know subaru have a trademark rattle and the one that seems to coming from dash can be solved in  dollars ,subaruoutback,depo15a,4,t5_2vbcx
