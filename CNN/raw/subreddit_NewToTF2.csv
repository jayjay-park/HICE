733478,0,t3_22iywa,As a Demoman Scout is your direct counter class.  Dont worry if you think they are difficult to hit theyre supposed to be. Heres some things you can do to help you chances against them... Dont get into a v with a Scout. Use your team to protect you and position yourself in a place where you are protected minisentries Heavies Soldiers or any clump of friendly players are great deterrent. There always always is a spot where you can deal damage without taking any. Situational awareness. Scouts love to come in towards the end of a fight when you are weak and out of ammo. Constantly be looking around and do your best to see them coming. Dont get ambushed. Fight on your own terms. Realize that in a wide open area especially with props to dodge on you are at a big disadvantage vs a Scout. In a small cramped hallway you have a HUGE advantage especially if you already have stickies down. . This rule is used by Soldiers too play as if you only have  pipebombs rockets so when you really really need that th one you have it. Use all your weapons. Use stickies to control their movement and pipes once you have a reasonable shot at hitting them. If you are out of ammo and fucked anyway pull out yer bottle a scrumpy. Keep your distance. Hitting a long range sticky or two will seriously deter them from attacking you. Once they get close switch to pipes for the kill. Know the maps. If you catch a glimpse of a Scout going X direction realize where he will probably end up and have a sticky or three waiting for him. Aim. Your. Pipes. Make them count they take forever and a day to reload. You only get  and need  directs to kill a nonpocketed Scout. I can probably write more but those are just basics.,NewToTF2,cgnnfaa,6,t5_2rbtk

2727646,0,t3_2r8x9g,A few more things to clarifyexpand upon SaviorHs answers.. There are a few strange weapons that are much rarer and harder to obtain than most others due to coming from rare crates that had very low drop chances called Salvaged or Select Reserve crates and thus they are all much pricier than the common stranges. The common stranges all go for less than a dollar or euro on the Steam Market while these rarer stranges from the rare crates can go for several dollarseuros  and even up to  the Strange Kritzkrieg.. Another type of semirare strange weapons are the Festive Stranges. Their value comes from the fact that they could or can in case of the latest ones only be unboxed for a limited time from Naughty Crates and their unbox chances are much rarer than the nonstrange Festives.. Unboxing for a particular strange weapon is a bad idea and a waste of money or metal as the strange weapon you get will be worth only a fraction of the price of the Key you bought to uncrate it. Theyre more of a consolation prize for not winning the crate lottery and getting an Unusual cosmetic which only have around a  uncrate chance and can go for a lot of money on the market.. The cheapest way of getting pretty much all of the nonrare stranges is to either buy them off the Market for real money many of them cost only a few cents or a few dozen cents at best or to trade for them using Metal as the least valuable currency in which case you can completely avoid spending any real money at all for most stranges. However saving up Metal crafted from item drops on a single TF account is quite slow these days as you only get around half a Refineds worth of item drops each week if you play a good amount of TF and reach the item drop cap each week. The really cheap stranges go for a few Scrap or a few Reclaimed in trading so you can acquire them with your weekly itemmetal drops quite easily. Those with a bit more value can go for multiple Refined which will take you quite a while to accumulate from just weapon drops on a single account.To put it briefly one can acquire some Stranges from just smelting down item drops and saving up on that metal but to get a lot of them especially the ones that arent dirt cheap and undesirable for most players youll have to spend a few cents or bucks on the community market. Its also more convenient than trading for them via various trading sites or trade servers though from my experience it seems that at such low levels of trading common affordable stranges the traders are quite honest and wont try to screw you over or scam you as much as when trading for more valuable stuff like Unusuals or the rare stranges.,NewToTF2,cne4eay,2,t5_2rbtk

5002665,0,t3_3jf4p2,To extend upon Kairus answer for the s mixes.  Kairu answered.  First come first serve although new to newbie mixes players are prioritized first.  There have been up to  mixes running at one time though the standard number is about two consecutive mixes.  Provided you can set aside an hour and a half you will definitely be able to complete a newbie mix no matter how many players are there..   Newbie mixes are for getting into the mindset of how to play the game competitively.  The goal is to teach you an understanding of how the game works which provided you have a good understanding of every classs abilities you are ready for a newbie mix..  Kairu answered how a mentor works but I think you were asking how a newbie mix works.  Yes the coach spectates and gives criticismsadvicereminders as the game progresses.  However before the game the coach talks about relevant topics and answers questions.  After the mix many coaches will stay and talk about each individual players performance and what they did rightwrong and what to improve on..  If there is ANY hostility in a newbie mix from player or coach that person is not welcome and will be dealt with swiftly.  Newbie mixes is a learning environment for new players.  Play the class you want to play in competitive in the newbie mix.  Take advantage of the fact that there is a highish level player there to tell you what you are doing rightwrong.  .  Skill level is low do not feel intimidated by lack of experience game playing ability or other inefficiency.  Remember the goal of newbie mixes is to teach people an understanding of how the game works not to teach them to move their cross hair onto baddies.  .  Ideally every newbie would have digested the following material sufficiently before playing.  Yes I understand the following is a lot and honestly there has yet to be a single newbie who has done all of this before playing so dont let the list be a deterrence.  Think of this list as a way to get the most out of playing in a newbie mix.    Newbies will have memorized to at least a basic level all map callouts which can be found at   Newbies will be able to complete at least a basic rollout from spawn to mid many example rollouts can be easily found by searching MAP rollout. Newbies will all have read Sigmas guide on pushing which can be found at   Newbies will all have watched every one of Marxists general class videos found at  under General Guides.  Under ideal circumstances newbies will have watched every other video done by marxist in the above link.  ,NewToTF2,cup0c0h,2,t5_2rbtk

5591651,0,t3_3rmovf,PrimariesThe Syringe Gun is a good weapon actually having a similar DPS to a Minigun if you can land all your shots. It has the largest clip in the game and a fast reload. It is a stock weapon and all around the best way to defend yourself if your team isnt doing so.The Crusaders Crossbow is the favourite of many Medics for its ability to heal teammates. At close range you can employ a puffandsting method to get teammates healed quickly shoot them with the Crossbow and switch to your secondary to finish up. The downside is that its terrible for defending yourself in emergencies even if you can hit all your shots.The Overdose is okay. A lot of people hate on it but its a negligible downside for a negligible upside. It can let you get away a little faster sometimes.The Blutsauger is the worst Medic primary. To get any benefit out of it you have to be fighting the enemy constantly which you should not be doing as Medic. I do use it occasionally but never in competitive play.Secondaries that is all. Please note that the Vaccinator was made even worse after this video came out.MeleesThe Bonesaw is your standard stock TF melee weapon. It is good.The Solemn Vow lets you see enemy health at the cost of  slower firing speed. Thats not that significant. Use it if nothing else appeals to you.The Ubersaw is the favourite of most Medics and is particularly useful if youre using the Medi Gun. But you have to make every hit count because of the slower firing speed.The Amputator is my personal favourite for its ability to supplement your natural health regeneration if you get hurt. You can actually outregenerate Degreaser afterburn if you have it active. Dont ever use the taunt for healing unless you are surrounded by severely injured teammates and safe from enemy fire.The VitaSaw is probably the games most controversial weapon. Its banned in competitive play because its overpowered but very few people use it even outside of competitive. Its useful as a training tool for new Medics who cant live long enough to get Uber.When I want to play as a mobile selfsufficient Medic in pubs I use OverdoseBlutsauger Quick Fix and Solemn Vow. Dont pocket people and dont be afraid to take on enemies yourself. I ran this loadout in a lobby with the Overdose and the enemy Medic who was using the Medi Gun just couldnt keep up with all the Ubers I was getting.,NewToTF2,cwq73bd,1,t5_2rbtk

5760923,0,t3_3tz414,Dying with full ber is called dropping it this is something youll be doing a lot if somebody is giving you shit about it they probably have played medic themselves less than  hours.  There is a saying going pop it dont drop it  if you have full ber and your life is in danger even if there is no one around you can pop your ber and try to run to safety  sometimes there just happens to be fully reloaded friendly soldier around the corner who demolishes your chasers.If dropping bothers you Gun Mettle update changed the mechanics so that you can pick up the ber you dropped last life. If you died relatively close to your spawn attackers have shorter respawn time than defenders in payload defense you most likely wont be able to do this you can switch to another medigun while waiting to respawn run back to where you died and pick up the gun you just dropped to receive full ber. I dont remember which key you use for this on default I have this bound on my mouse . Remember that if you wont be able to pick up your last gun youll be stuck with the other medigun you just chose and if the area you dropped has become contested it might be better to fall back and start building again.Most of the time people whacking their medic is them trying to get medics attention. Its fucking annoying. Something you can try is to call Medic! back when somebody is calling for you  this lets then know your general position if you are out of their sight and lets them know you heard them. Other than that just stick to your priorities of the moment  I usually priorize scouts quite high especially if they are getting job done. Scouts are quick to overheal and then theyll be off your back and let you build in peace.Id also advice you to play lots of other classes in case youve been playing only Medic recently. Youll learn flank routes somebody could try to attack you better get better movement and aim yes you need aim as a medic to get good Youll also learn what weapons your teammates use affect your healing abilities what limits other classes have in pushing with ber etc.Unfortunately there will always be dumbasses who will be mean to you no matter how good you play. Just a month ago a random medic said to voice chat which is so hardly used in EU I was kinda shocked he knew how to use it at all that I shouldnt play the game. I answered him with a hearty maniac laugh and destroyed the enemy team. He didnt say much to that but kept me alive the rest of the game. You play the game to get better theres nothing to change that. You can learn stuff from videos etc but you need to try things out yourself in the end. Mute unnecessary aggros keep close to people who keep YOU alive and have fun. EDIT English is hard,NewToTF2,cxb72jk,2,t5_2rbtk

6815395,0,t3_493a2d,To give you some perspective on this TF is a game from  running on a  version of a very old engine Source from . Because of that you would expect it to run flawlessly on any remotelymodern gaming PC from the last  years. In the first few years of its life the game was indeed quite optimized at the time and ran with perfect  fps considered to be a standard for smooth performance unless you have a  Hz gaming monitor most LCD screens are still  hz on max settings on PCs that would be considered waaaaay obsolete nowadays. But due to the games degrading performance across the many patches and updates across the years those same machines from  would absolutely not be able to run TF nearly as well today and many users experience surprisingly low framerates or big fps drops when theres loads of players onscreen even on really powerful PCs from recent years that shouldnt even break a sweat running this game. Games on the same engine like HalfLife s Episode  CSGO Left  Dead  and  Portal  and Dota  before it got ported to Source  generally run way better and with less severe framedrops on modern machines. I can keep a perfect rocksolid  fps on my  gaming PC in all those games while TF will regularly drop into the  fps range in larger firefights. A lot of people would consider that smooth but big drops from  to  are very noticeable and irritating and its still subpar performance on a machine that can handle other Source games and much newer more graphically advanced games better than it runs TF.The worst part is that the game hasnt really been upgraded in terms of graphics or physics since its release . years ago. The textures models particle effects physics etc. everything looks the same as it did nearly  years ago. In fact theyve actually downgraded some things for performance reasons character and weapon models have different Levels of Detail depending on distance certain firstperson weapon models have been made more simple and lack features like loaded grenades or rockets theyve recently added texturestreaming which means certain textures start in a blurry state initially and need a few seconds to turn into a higres variant and so on.Many old games that remain popular for many years switch over to a newer fancier engine at some point or they keep upgrading their graphics to keep up with the times. TF nowadays pretty much looks like it did in  graphicswise maybe certain newer maps or models introduced later are a bit richer and more detailed but thats about it so theres no good reason to warrant such a performance decrease and the game often running poorly on older machines and sometimes lessthangreat on even newer machines.Other than the fact that Valve have simply added so much new content and code to the game over the years that its become a bloated unoptimized mess that runs far worse than youd expect from a year old game running on a year old graphics engine. ,NewToTF2,d0otmc7,35,t5_2rbtk

9471399,0,t3_5aeevk,OP username checks out.First thing you need to do is give up the idea of better items. TF is not paytowin. All drop weapons in TF are designed to be sidegrades  weapons that are just as powerful as the stock weapons you start with. There are no direct upgrades. There are weapons that are noticeably more or less powerful than stock but thats simply due to poor balancing. All weapons with bonuses have downsides. Those that dont simply treat the lack of the stock weapon as a downside.Weapons specifically drop weapons come as random drops about once per hour ingame. There is a limit of ten weapons per week which resets every Thursday. Youll see them onscreen when you die. You can also get nontradable versions of certain weapons from achievements.Also level in casual doesnt mean anything besides time spent in casual.,NewToTF2,d9gjzpb,1,t5_2rbtk

9717890,0,t3_5e4ltr,This vid is about the tickets and rewards of mvm.Some general rules communicate with the others. Most of the games end up failing due to beginners not responding to the rest while getting stupid upgrades andor using not appropriate weapons. if you dont know something ask. Most of the experienced players are willing to help out. listen to those who know what they are doing. If someone is telling you not to use a certain wep or place a building in a specific spot its for a most of the times good reason. tour counts are not a  indicator of experience. Ive had many games of players with a few dozen tours and seemingly they still didnt have a clue of how they should have been playing. And Ive had low tourer players who exactly knew what was going on and what to do.Low tour count wont always mean no experience. They may have a higher lvl badge in other tours. They could have deleted their badge this resets the tour count back to . They may be playing on an alt account. They could have been preparing for a long time before manning up etc. understand the mechanics of mvm. Instead of classes youll need to think of roles.For most missions youll needa money collector scout or spy pyro and sniper can help out but anyone can just go and walk over the cashsomeone to deal with the medic bots if there are in a wave demo and sniper are the most suited for thissomeone for the tank if theres one pyro with the phlog is best solidemo is okayplayers to do dmg in general soli demo heavy pyro engis sentryand usually an engineer disp for ammo  so that players dont have to spend for ammo upgrades early oncamp the ammo packs  and healthtp so that you dont have to walk for minutes before getting to the frontsentry for doing good amount of dmg.There are countless guides you can read on steam although some of them are bad and outdated theres also some stuff on the tf wiki you can check out.,NewToTF2,daaxvne,1,t5_2rbtk

11481065,0,t3_6288z2,Most of the advice here is only about mechanical aim and is therefore only telling part of the story.Getting comfy with your settings while necessary is only half the battle. Your targets and yourself move and in TF in general they move a lot be it properly or badly.Pay attention to how your opponents move youll better be able to predict where to shoot. Yes predict. You dont have to lead targets like you do with projectiles but anticipating with your crosshair where youll be able to get the next shot instead of simply reacting will make you a lot less reliant on twitch. Twitching is useful in a v face to face. But against a target unaware of you you obviously dont need it. The best image I can give you is to let them walk into your crosshair.Part of having a better hitscan aim is to have what in CS they call proper crosshair placement dont aim at the ground anticipate potential angles etc. You minimise the need for major adjustments and can hence better focus on the few that you have to make.,NewToTF2,dfxdjn9,1,t5_2rbtk
