I use Oggdudes software to edit. Giving a Nemesis XPReceiving XP  Nemesis should earn the same amount of XP as the PC who earned the greatest amount  additional XP per session.Spending XP . Skill ranks cost x the rank being purchased in XP and must be purchased sequentially. In essence this means the nemesis purchases skills in the same way as a PC except he treats all skills as career skills.Nemesis may select any one Specialization that a PC also possesses wo spending any XP. He may spend XP in the same way PC would. If he completes the tree he may select a new Specialization also possessed by a PC.Nemesis may purchase talents excluding Dedication not found in his Specialization. However if he does so the GM must spend  XP per talent.Ive taken NPCs like the Pirate Captain and kitted them out as my PCs are earning XP.

For random mooks that the party encounters let the player shine  after all these mooks wouldnt have any reason to suspect that theyre encountering a Superdroid. These are the encounters that will really play to that players strengths and he should feel good about his success in them!However  the party has some Obligation no? And remember that the obligation of the party as a whole is also a representation of their notoriety in the criminal underworld. So particularly on sessions when their obligation triggers and especially when its this players obligation maybe the enemies theyre fighting have heard tales of this indestructible droid and theyve come prepared. Theyll either work to separate him from his party disable him the magnets and ion weapons suggested here should work great for that or distract him while their companions achieve their objectives.Finally remember that danger can be different from damage in combat. If the goal of the combat is simply to live through it then hes likely to succeed  but if the party is trying to fight their way through some guards to get to the control room before the villains shuttle takes off then it doesnt matter how tough Superdroid is If the party cant take down the guards fast enough they lose. In essence your Superdroid player has specialized in surviving encounters where people try to blast him  so in order to challenge him you need to present the party with encounters that are constructed in a different way ideally ones that will play towards the strengths of the other party members so that everyone gets to have their moment.,swrpg,cgcfyjs,5,t5_2vzmi

Perhaps you counted the opponent but then another group rounded the corner that you werent aware of. Or maybe they set up am ambush that you didnt spot.Now for the Advantage. I would use this to trigger a significant game changing event. You miscounted the troops or failed to detect an ambush or other action. But you did find another entry into the building that the didnt trap. Or maybe one of the hostages does something to serve as a distraction giving everyone an opportunity to move in undetected.

You might consider getting the beginner box and running a couple of sessions with that. I am sure with your experience level you dont need it but for the price its worth it. You get the dice and a set of four pregen characters that have all the symbols used on the dice helpfully printed on the sheets. The introductory adventure is not even close to a sandbox but it does a great job of walking groups through the basic mechanics of the system.

3839501,0,t3_34ej82,High brawn characters typically have normal to low strain thresholds so if they are constantly pushing themselves they will be very susceptible to stun settings.Also crits while they do give wookies a slight enrage will quickly hamperscare any character. The way crits stack make the next ones constantly worse means that characters that have been already crit are more likely to outright die from more crits.The core issue I have made or found with high brawn or agility characters even is that combat becomes very partial. Not everyone in the party is going to be as combat focused how do you create a situation where no one at the table feels like they cant contribute? Sure the wookie never dies and uses enemy droids as improvised weapons against baddies but hes going to suck at a costume party. There is a lot more to the game than cool combat as with any RPG its finding the balance in making every player feel powerful in their own right. Its not bad for a player to feel powerful by destroying combat situations it is bad if no one else feels powerful because all the party sees are combat situations and that player dominates because of the encounter.,swrpg,cqtxqce,8,t5_2vzmi
3847758,0,t3_34hzjm,Welcome to SWRPG! This is a wonderful system and a great community!. Obligations are both a game mechanic and storytelling device. They represent concerns that have the potential to draw quite a bit of your characters attention. They can take many different forms as listed in the CRB. You can choose them individually andor have them assigned as a group obligation to your entire party. In the multiGM campaign I run many of the participants have individual obligations but there is also a group obligation related to a recurring villain. I suggest going back over pages  particularly the example on page  assembling the groups obligation. Along those lines heres a post of mine on a slightly different question that illustrates how stories can build off Obligation as well as Duty and Morality.. Work it out with the other participants in your campaign and see if your background story meshes well with the other ideas put forth. A lot of crunch like specific language proficiencies are handwaved in this system. Overall your specific example would be a very rare occurrence but if you really like it go for it!. Crits at their most basic represent serious wounds that generally take longer to heal and are harder to mend than the simple ones measured against wound threshold.  I recommend reading pages . One thing that a lot of people miss is that at least one point of damage must get through soak or armor for a crit to be activated page .,swrpg,cquvmsb,4,t5_2vzmi

Jedi mind tricks might be the way to go  they always seemed incredible morally questionable in the prequel trilogy and yet the jedi are completely okay with using them for minor things like free submarines not like preventing a war or anything.

4256920,0,t3_39qb82,You may want to check out Force and Destiny essentially it gives a number of specializations that focus more heavily on force and lightsaber use. And in making the character if you want the force to be a more central aspect to the character having them start out in Force and Destiny careers is probably the way to go. Its currently in Beta and the full release will probably be out by August the latest.Building with EotE and having the character go into ForceSensitive Exile is more indicative skill and talentwise that the character has had to spend more time adjusting to their life around the Outer Rim.So for a character living out in the wilderness if you decide to have the character more defined by his nonForce Sensitive skills you may opt to start in EotEs Bounty HunterSurvivalist or ExplorerScout and then buy into ForceSensitive Exile. Whereas if they still connect more to their Force abilities even if they havent been using them that much over the many years you might consider FaDs SeekerHunter or SeekerPathfinder.And in terms of power as long as youre not trying to intentionally break the system you dont need to worry about being overpowered with force users.

The primary difference there is white wolf published a core book that was setting independent and then released a book for each template. I believe they abandoned that model for their most current implementation of world of darkness though. Their newest version is the same as ffg with Star Wars. Honestly for the amount of content in the books I dont mind this release schedule. They are not small books at all and there was so much time between each release that it really did feel to me less like a cash grab and more like hobbyists trying to make the purest product they could. If there had only been a couple months between books and each was only  pages Id be a lot more cynical.

While Im not certain at the moment how Id handle a PC capable of flying in terms of checksmaneuvers there probably wont be any real advantages in combat.

5107126,0,t3_3krd5v,I think the short answer is through narrative. I could think of a few. Give him the opportunity to save multiple lives or his own by taking a life. If he tries to use stun take the setting away when he rolls a threat. If he still refuses let him die. If hes creating actual problems kill him off seriously. Players need to stick to their character but at the same time if theyre breaking the game then theyre ruining it for everyone else.Ive got a similar dynamic between a Wequay and a Trandoshian. They will sit and hiss at each other over prisoners while everyone else is strategizing.  The Trandoshian will antagonize the Wequay by dismembering corpses or just generally being a terror to weak adversaries. It drives the Wequay crazy. Wequay in turn will take ownership of prisoners immediately to protect them from the transdoshian. This drives the Trandoshian crazy. They will eventually fight I guarantee it.This is how these sorts of conflicts lend to the game where the players understand their role in the crew and want to earn credits. They should be entertaining and lend to the idea of criminals in outer space.When someone makes the game less enjoyable because they raise a stink thats not a problem with anything other than that player. Tldr give the player options to disorient their moral compass. If they dont play along kill him off or tell the other players privately that they can space him.,swrpg,cv1llk0,1,t5_2vzmi

You could say something along the lines of you have this stat block A high int low brawn when outside of the labor droid and stat block B high brawn low int when inside. And the labor droid only functions when the ball droid is plugged in. Then the back story would be that his labor droid was slapped together from a junked droid. It has no processor which is why the ball droid has to be plugged in to make it work. But its wiring is a bit off so when the ball droid does plug in it overloads its systems a bit thus the lower int.And then just make it clear they wont get any extra points or benefits for character advancement. So if they want to upgrade the labor droids wiring to up the int of the combined droid theyll have to pay for it the same as any other character advancement.Of course make sure this is okay with your other players as others have suggested.,swrpg,cvpfbgp,3,t5_2vzmi

Even the lightsaber benefits from a high Brawn rating unless youre playing one of the Force and Destiny classes that specifically switches Lightsabers base statistic to Dexterity or Cunning.  If this guys trying to be your Jedi wannabe  he should probably have a higher basse Brawn than that unless hes planning on picking up one of those altbase stat Jedi classes in which case he should realize that hes basically useless in melee right now.  Regardless he should at least carry some kind of ranged weapon.  Even Luke carried one in Empire to help him deal with ranged threats.  Perhaps you can use this as a teachable moment for his character and point out that hes not some Billy Badass hes just some guy whos a little bit Forcesensitive.Forcesensitive Exiles and Emergents and even the base classes in Force and Destiny are NOT  I repeat  NOT Jedi Knights.  Theyre barely even Padawantier.  Theyre just folks who have learned about their connection to the Force and maybe got a little training somewhere.  It can be a bit strange to get your head around at first but these characters are just barely starting their journey into the mysteries of the Force.  Theyre not that powerful.  Perhaps the player misunderstands what these characters are or has some misconceptions about just how powerful his character is in the grand scheme of things.Also this was a boss encounter.  Nemesisclass characters are supposed to be the equals of PCs in every way... and often are better than them in some respects just to make for a challenging and memorable encounter.As pointed out you messed up on the Pierce  and the Stun blasts at long range.Have you spent most of your starting XP on attributes or skillsspecializations?  Usually the best thing to do is get higher base stats since its very difficult to upgrade those later in the game and you can get skillstalents and such at any time.Perhaps some respecs are in order since youve learned a bit from this session...   ,swrpg,cx3gsb5,4,t5_2vzmi

In my group thats generally one of the two people with lightsabers or the hired gun with the repeating blaster mathematically its the hired gun but some people find lightsabers more threatening. Does an NPC have a particular story reason to attack one PC over another? One of my players delights in taunting NPCs. Last time he did it a Dark Jedi hit him in the head with a rock during the first round of combat. He deserved it.  Who is easy to hit? This can be positioning Gamorrean with a vibroax is more likely to attack the person hes Engaged with than the sniper at Extreme range or it can be a case of Well that person is using copious amounts of DodgeSide StepForce Sense to avoid everything while wearing heavy armor and that person is wearing regular clothes... that person is easier for me to hit.  How hurt are people? This can go two different ways. If I dont want to drop anyoneeveryone Ill hold off on targeting someone who is badly hurt and go after someone fresh. This is a meta decision that Im making for a smoother game experience  I generally dont want to knock someone out in the first round of combat if I think its going to go several rounds because that generally isnt fun for the player.

6246652,0,t3_414hv4,Instead of starting out with a certain level of XP give them a certain amount of force powers.Start them off at Force Rating Give them Move Enhance Sense and Misdirect I think misdirect is the mind trickGive them a mix of levels i.e. make them unique with their strengths in the force but give them levels in all of them.Then give them their starting XP for talents  skills and maybe like xp more but  of it has to go into force powers.By giving them the force powers you cover the basic stuff we see every Jedi doing in the books. It also is going to work out to like  XP in the end but will give you characters who can do stuff we see characters doing in canon and other sources.As a note I have a much higher level game but recently forced the PCs gave them the XP for it to so maybe not forced to take certain force powers to cover the general gamut of powers we see jedi doing in the moviesshowsbooks after  years of training with a couple of people trained in the old ways a sith and a former padawan that is their mentor. Those PCs now feel and act like real Jedi characters as opposed to a bunch of force sensitive one trick ponies with lightsabers. Other PCs got similar XP but more freedom to let them keep up. Its all worked out well so far.Edit the extra  XP I mentioned is only if they were padawans who were being mentored by an individual master.  If they werent at that level dont give them the  xp and give them less force powers. If they are more like Ahoska and got several years with their mentor in the clone wars give them more XP.,swrpg,cyzoda7,0,t5_2vzmi

6302852,0,t3_41w5bb,I ran a speeder race adventure with the focus being on alternate skill uses. Instead of rolling piloting all the time I offered the players a chance to propose other skills. For example the race approaches a sarlacc pit. You can pilot around it or you can use rangedgunnery to shoot at the sarlacc distracting it long enough to whiz past. Or if you are approaching a tight canyon you could just roll piloting or you could maybe make a vigilance check to jockey for position at the last minute before the canyon walls narrow.Thats what that section of the rulebook is trying to explain. The players should be coming up with suggestions for how they can contribute to the fight using any and all skills available to them. A knowledge roll could indicate that there is a dangerous gang that operates in this asteroid field and that they have a particular dislike for TIE fighters. Athletics could get you down the ladder and quickly to a blown piece of equipment or fragile cargo that needs protecting. Charm can keep the debutante you are escorting calm while the ship weaves and rocks from enemy fire. Anything is possible if you believe hard enough that sounds ridiculous.,swrpg,cz62adg,1,t5_2vzmi
6308789,0,t1_cz6kl2t,True however sources of Soak can stack together.FampD pg  Soakgt Soak stacks when it is from different sources such as heavy assault armor and subdermal plating. Multiple applications of the same source do not stack however. A character cannot wear three suits of heavy assault armor and stack the soak bonuses from each.So officially its still possible for someone to get a really good source of Defense and then stack a bunch of Soak sources too. But you cant compound any sources of Defense at all officially.,swrpg,cz6qlg5,1,t5_2vzmi

6365245,0,t3_42u85e,There are a lot of missing details here that might help us make better sense of the situation but ...... chances are that the issue is not really about his character at all but that the player isnt enjoying where the campaign is going and is trying to make a stand against it to change things. Hes kind of saying Nice try GM but come up with a different game.Youll want to talk to this player outside of the session ... and ask what he would like out of scenarios and what would draw him and his character into things. Maybe even have that discussion with the whole group. Make sure that everyone is on the same page as to what they want to do. EVERYONE should be willing to flex a little bit if people arent yet on the same page  even the GM . After a short discussion ... you should be good to go.Further ... there are plenty of things you can do to help support a heist that wont necessarily ruin your public reputation.

6401876,0,t1_czgztnt,True but there are other weapons out there that do that much damage or more. Even more legal than disruptors.I mean its a star wars game so lightsabers are going to be powerful but guns still do just fine. You also have a good amount of mods on your saber or a special crystal to do that much damage. Vicious  is  mod rolls on an illum crystal which is base damage   with superior. So you already have at least  damage mods   vicious mods on the crystal. Even with the  difficulty for your own saber thats a hefty mechanics roll.Not to mention the defensive quality is either a specialty hilt or an additional mod.At base value you have your basic lightsaber damage  crit  encumberance  sunder breach . This is a very powerful melee weapon on its own. But again breach is only useful if the target has a high soak because yeah it ignores  soak but if they only have  soak that is  wasted points of potential buff.The encumberance  is really an overlooked detail of how strong a saber is though. Having a potential damage  weapon with all those qualities with only  encumberance is kind of nuts because it means it can be fit in anywhere.But anyhow. You also have things like the DR Dragoon Base Damage  Crit  Encumberance   HP Accurate Stun Setting. Throw a BAM or something on there  superior and you have a damage  weapon. And youre still only at about  the cost of a Superior lightsaber before any other mods. Meaning you could add a second  and the paired weapon quality. Now if you hit Superior means you are probably proccing your second gun. So  damage cranted soak applies twice with a potential pierce  on the BAM though you are right that is harder to do than say. Plus with a DR you can start shooting from range and use it with two different skills if you want to.,swrpg,czhbue9,2,t5_2vzmi
6404855,0,t1_czhnlrc,This is actually making a lot of sense and is kind of what I had assumed. I dont like leaving any players out at any point in the adventure which is my main reason for the question.I think it would be interesting to have a force sensitive bounty hunter as you have mentioned which would allow them to participate in more force heavy encounters. Ill have to see if the player would be interested in playing a class such as the SeekerHunter.,swrpg,czho0kb,3,t5_2vzmi
6407116,0,t3_43frpa,The best advice I can give that helps answer all four of your questions is that this game is very narratively focused. You as the GM have a lot of leeway in the type of game you want to run. As written its really difficult to kill PCs and fairly easy to kill minions. You have a lot of tools at your disposal to adjust that as you see fit. A good starting point for the first games combat is an equal number of minions to PCs in the party plus one rival. If you have a real bruiser in your party add one or two minions. Have the minions fight as individuals to start not as a group. Have them go down as a group however damage is counted as a pool so  damage would take down  minions with  wound threshold possibly at once this is a lot of fun for your bruiser. A point here one roll does not mean one hit. Combat is cinematic. One roll is meant to represent a moment in battle and can represent several shots or swings in battle. As your party advances start experimenting with nemesis level enemies and giving them the adversary talent. Start experimenting with minions fighting in groups. This allows minions to add yellow dice for each minion present to skills they are trained in making them suddenly more dangerous. This doesnt necessarily mean sending a squad of  Imperial troopers but maybe two squads of  imperial troopers. For dramatic encounters like this which you want to last your minions dont have to go down as a group your party has to do  wound to each individual. Up to you. As your party progresses youre really the one wholl understand what theyre capable of.As for non combat types allow them and encourage them to get creative. Talents like Scathing Tirade allow face type charters to damage enemies strain possibly taking minions out of combat without a shot. Imagine this plays out in combat. Lady they arent paying me enough to deal with this as the novice bounty hunter leaves the field. Thats actually listed in the book. You can also do things like let a bookworm type character roll to recognize a fighting style he read about and shout out tips about an opponent to the group granting boost die or even better on truly successful roles. Or perhaps a medic recognizes an opponent favors his left side and lets the party know about an old injury this opponent must have suffered. ,swrpg,czhxa0w,5,t5_2vzmi
6427510,0,t1_czk3yaz,So a critical hit and a critical wound are separate things.  A critical hit causes a critical wound.  A critical hit resolves immediately and only lasts as long as the text says it does.  Some say they last a round some say they last an encounter some are just permanent until healed these are in the very high numbers on the chart some are forever permanent regardless if theyve been healed or not see crit .  Permanent ability loss.  No getting it back.  Ever..A critical wound remains on the character even after the critical hit text is resolved.  Its like a remnant of the wound they received and they do not have any detrimental effects other than any future critical hits add  to the die roll for every critical wound still on the character.  So if a critical hit forces them to drop a weapon then that resolves immediately and they can pick up their weapon on their next turn.  The critical wound it creates doesnt keep causing them to drop a weapon its more like a bad burn on the hand or something that doesnt give them any other negative status effects other than the stacking  I menitoned.Critical wounds can only be healed once a week via medicine checks or a resilience check and their difficulty to be healed is shown on the crit chart.  If they are in a bacta tank they can attempt a resilience check to heal a critical wound once every  hours they remain in the tank.  Or as I mentioned on a normal medicine check to heal normal wounds a Triumph can be used to get rid of a critical wound.They are definitely a good idea to get rid of as the stacking  can be bad.  ,swrpg,czk54sw,2,t5_2vzmi

Suddenly the vision ends ... and you find yourself kneeling once more on the sandy streets of Mos Eisley.... and then let HER do the interpretations.

6872805,0,t3_49rkg8,This is as uLanuria said a group decision. You need to make sure everyone in the group is cool with it.Now that said the way the system works starting characters can be quite capable in their area of specialty. A skill of two and trait of three or vice versa will get you pretty far in the game depending on your gear and the encounters the GM is setting up. because of this even with characters having  XP more than the others people will still have a chance to shine.Now that said xp is NOT enough for a character to start out as a Jedi Knight how you think of it from moviesbookscartoons. Hell xp wont let you build Anakin from the Clone Wars cartoon or ObiWan. Granted AnakinObiWan are a bit ridiculous.Because of this youd probably be better with an NPC mentor just to get the Knight feel across. If your group is cool with it I say do it. That said youd be better off just giving the Jedi Knight character some things instead of XP even though it will add up to more than xp in the end.At minimum a Jedi Knight should have Force Rating . The ability to Force Move at least a silhouette  object. Force Influence. Force Enhance and at least the first horizontal jump ability. At least one rank of Parry. At least on rank of Reflect. reflect is optional if the person goes into mystic.Getting the Force Rating to  is the hard part and costs about  XP on its own since Force Rating  is almost always a Tier  advantage and is Tier  at best.The four force powers I listed are xp just tounlock the base powers and then another  for the very minimal enhancements I suggested.

At least in AoR the inference is one of a militaristic team with complimentary specialized skills.In games that I have played I have found it advantageous to be good  Characteristic of   at a wide range of things because it has given me the flexibility to competently help the party as needed. Pilot got shot and is laying unconscious in the bunks while we try to blast out of Ord Mantell with TIEs on our tail?

It makes you Albert Einstein or Tom Brady. A superstar who makes hard things look easy and impossible things possible.The reason I state that it is a poor GM who makes you feel that minmaxing is necessary is that only a poor GM will automatically scale encounter difficulty based on character capability rather than what might be realistic in the game universe. This type of activity is rampant within RPGs like Pathfinder where even published adventures will have a Perception check difficulty of  at level  and  for the exact same type of Perception check   at level . A good GM looks at a potential encounter and says no matter the skills or experience level of the party the difficulty to achieve x should be ...  and then lets things fall where they may.

They do not posses any means of space travel so they will have to make their way to the spaceport at the capitol Pandath. The journey requires traveling through a small jungle that isolates their home community from the more populated areas. This can take several days by foot but Mother does have an old broken down landspeeder that can get them there in several hours instead. The landspeeder requires minimal repairs with parts and tools being readily accessible. The PCs can attempt to repair the speeder with an Average Mechanics check.If the party proceeds on foot they must make a Easy Survival check. Failure on the check results in the PCs loosing a day on the travel and having to make another check to finish the journey. Threat can be spent on both success or failure to have the PCs encounter a feral creature in the jungle.Traveling by landspeeder requires an Easy Pilot Planetary check with two setbacks. Failure results in the trip taking a few hours longer than expected. If the failed check generates three or more threat the speeder breaks down either through collision or another component going out and the PCs must continue on foot since they will not be able to repair it this time. If this is the case the PCs finish the journey with a Simple Survival check. Threat on a successful check can cause minor damage to the speeder andor strain to the PCs.Once the party has made it to Pandath they have several options to get to Fondor.

Vader noted in the Tarkin novel that their combat abilities had degraded by then presumably  BBY. Assuming a clone was aged and trained for  years he was in only the last year of the Clone Wars that makes him approximately  biologically at the time the Death Star was destroyed.  Thats old especially considering that ObiWas was apparently  when he died although Guiness was  when he played him.  Count Dooku was  when he died.  Han Solo was probably around  when he died.  Leia is  in TFA.My point is hes old yes.  But all of these characters died violent deaths not of natural causes and disease.  And they were perfectly capable just up until their deaths.

They had FR  at the time and a bunch of strength upgrades.The reason I didnt choose bind is because the player wasnt trying to subdue the dinosaurs actions but merely Move them to a location where their actions were meaningless.  I did implement a strain penalty for maintaining this which is why they dropped them once they had gotten some distance.He also wasnt using any special power to drag them.  I just interpret the Force to work that way.  If you use Move to lift a pebble while youre in a car and the car starts moving the pebble moves with you.  I did this to avoid any magic spell situations where someone can make something float then just walk away and the pebble keeps floating.

8887545,0,t3_51wkbr,My two cents is that the boxes are a waste of money.  Unless dice sets are hard to find where you live then you might as well go with a box because  a set on Amazon is stupid.  Honestly if you are going to buy physical dice you might as well buy two sets.  One set really isnt enough for all the roles you are going to be making.  Keep in mind that you only have two options for dice official FFG dice or an app.  At first this may seem like a negative and maybe it is but Ive also found that it leads to more dice sharing at my table.  This is good because as I said one set of dice isnt enough.  Youll recall I also mentioned an App there are several a few free but the best by far is the official FFG app . USD I think.  I personally dont like using dice rollers but I know people who swear by them.Now back to the Rules.  You have  options. There are core books and box sets for Edge of the Empire Age of Rebellion and Force and Destiny plus the newest box set for the Force Awakens.  Eventually youre going to want someone in your group to have each of the  books but you dont really need to own more than one core book.  Also to start off playing you really only need one.  For the most part the rules are the same across the books and the main difference are in character options.  For my money I like Edge of the Empire as I find the Obligation mechanic a good why to bind a new group together but is largely a matter of personal preference.  The other thing worth noting is that all of the books are designed to work well together so if you have a player who is pumped about playing a jedi but you wanted to go bounty hunter there wont be a problem you will likely just want to buy both core books.What about the source books you say?  Well that leads me to the next most important thing.  Do yourself a favor and pick up OggDudes Character Generator There are a holy crap ton of character creation options in this game and its nonlinear character advancement can quickly get overwhelming.  OggDudes program makes the whole process much easier.  The other thing your are going to want is some spreadsheets that show you all the options side by side.  For that youll want to go here  Working under the assumption that you arent going to just download a torrent with all the books scans in it those two sources are going to allow you to identify which books to spend your money on next.  Not that youll need to right away.  Between the character builder and the core book youll have plenty of options to work with.Misc. Stuff.  While this game uses range bands I have found minis to be useful for visualizing relative positions.  The boxes include tokens which will work fine.  If you are looking for something more D Id suggest you check out the old Wizards of the Coast Star Wars mini line which is still being sold online.  For ships the micro machine ones will work or you can always go with the Xwing miniature game ships but again that gets pricey quick although its a great game too.  GM screens are nice but not required dont stress about that.  If you google around you will find lots of good community made handouts that are just as good and free.  Lastly if you go with the app over dice youre going to need a way to track destiny points.  Othello pieces work great for this but a black and a white d will work in a pinch.Finding a GM.  Personally Ive had a lot of luck with Facebook.  I found two different groups in my area when I looked.  Even if there isnt a SWFFG group specifically you will likely be able to find a Star Wars fan page.  Of course you can always ask around your local game store or check out Meetups.com.  SW is hot right now thanks to the movies so ask around enough and you are likely to stumble upon someone.Best of luck,swrpg,d7g5o8i,1,t5_2vzmi

The argument could be made that the total sacrifice here is  xp   xp in extra training cost for  skills x    xp in training cost for the one lost free train .However Force Sensitive Emergent  Exile ... gets only FR  not any access to Specialization Skills  which a character would get should they normally switch Specializations . In that sense it is potentially true that the Emergent  Exile is still more expensive than getting an FampD Specialization from the start. HOWEVER ... most specializations have at least  skill overlap with their career ... and many have  or   I know of at least one specialization that has  overlap .Conclusion? FFG has it right. The sacrifice is roughly the same.However IF you want to grant a Force Rating and give someone an FampD specialization ... do it by charging them an extra xp for the specialization. Id say that type of custom rule would be generally welcome around the table and not too unbalancing IF you guys are that adverse to EmergentExile. I might add that the xp cost is going to be roughly equivalent to getting Emergent  Exile  xp  and then an FampD specialization  xp.

Ive given it out immediately when they negotiated to owe a favor in exchange for ship repairs and delayed when they kept a disruptor pistol but didnt use it for a while. When at the table I give in game knowledge hints that obligaton will be involved you know the hutt cartel will miss this crate and come looking for it the imperials wouldnt take the death of a moffs son lightly and will issue a bounty for the killers etc. That way they arent surprised when I add obligation after they still decide to do it. IMO since obligation effects the strain threshold of the character its a measure of when and how much it weighs on the PCs mind. In your examples they know they stole the spiceguns and theyll be on someones hot list sooner or later and I would give the obligation immediately.

They didnt attack innocent bystanders to prevent the story from getting out they proactively defended themselves. Theres a lot that could be said regarding the ambiguity of what is good and what is evil and how those definitions change from one persons perspective to another. The history of the  parties matters because it narrows the probable course of imminent events. For instance the Stormtroopers likely believed they were acting in a wholly moral way and had they attacked the Force sensitives they would have felt justified in doing so as a result of their Imperial training and the standpoint that Jedi are a threat to the Empire. Were they Sector Security rather than Imperials there wouldnt be so much bias to sway the decisions of either party and the probability of a nonviolent outcome would be more likely. As the scene has been painted for us we can only assume that combat was imminent anyways.Were I in the partys shoes I would have attacked as well and felt no internal conflict in doing so because I was acting in defense of myself and my companions. I feel this is backed by the criteria in Table  page  in the CRB. Resorting to violence as a first solution which should only be  Conflict anyways is not what happened here. They tried to lie their way through the security check that failed and things went sideways rapidly. They defended themselves.

10094707,0,t3_5kamyk,Okay here goes nothing!You already have a good solid backstory framework between your  protagonists. As soon as I saw the Jedi sister went dark side I was going to tell you to make her the Inquisitor but I guess youre a step ahead of me! Thats such a beautiful Star Wars style character connection between Slatina and Joshua and you have so many potential plot threads to make with it.The only issue I see is that if the sister was at the Temple during Order  she would have died. The Inquisitorius was not founded that early in the Empire and Vaderthe st would have had standing orders to destroy any force users. That said she could easily have been on trial and imprisoned on Coruscant think of Ahsoka and Bariss in TCW left to rot after the Empire took over and discovered later by the Inquisitors. That would also give her some time months? A year? to stew in the Dark Side and go a little crazy.Hedwig seems to be the least connected of the  which isnt necessarily a bad thing I mean look at Han Solo. Dont be tempted to throw Hedwig a bunch of backstory plot twists just say it was the Force that brought the three together and let her naturally develop relationships with the otherswith NPCswith villains.If you want Claire to be a deconstructed princess in peril Id suggest making her either a Rebel agent or some kind of information broker that the Empire wants taken out of commission. Not Princess Leia level but someone who would have access to sectorlevel Imperial troop and fleet movements important cargo shipments things like that. Shes capable enough but when the EmpireHuttsBlack SunBounty hunters are all after her shell probably need periodic assistance. That also makes her an excellent questgiver since shell always be connected to something interesting happening in the galaxy.I think Kel has the most potential to be a really fun NPC. First a rogue ISB agent is a great background for a rebel but I think Kel will work better as the partys foil at least for the first few story arcs. So lets make him a loose cannon ISB agent assigned to track down dangerous criminals... specifically thieves and Imperial deserters. Hes not really in the Force business and in fact he hates the idea that the Empire is so focused on wiping out a tiny religious sect when they should be funding the ISB and cracking down on the lawless Outer Rim. That means hell function as the party rival at first but once the Inquisitors show up with beef he may be tempted to side with the party against the creepy Force assassins.,swrpg,dbnct49,2,t5_2vzmi

10232658,0,t3_5mg78a,The thing about Force users in this game is they just have a LOT more places they can spend XP compared to a non Force user. In AOR or EOTE you feel like a total badass at about  XP. Youve probably maxed a tree out or gotten everything you wanted out of like two of them and have a core skill or two at  ranks. With Force users? You still feel like you cant do everything a regular Jedi can do at  XP. You are still only rolling  Force dice to try and activate Force powers which means you cant trigger many upgrades. You only have like one tree mostly filled up a couple basic Force powers with  upgrades and your skills all feel too low. So yeah because there are so many other places to spend XP the Force users can eventually feel a lot more powerful because of their Force powers. However XP for XP they should feel more or less balanced with AOR and EOTE characters the whole way through. The problem youre going to run into is the AOR and EOTE characters will run out of directions they want to advance the character or start to feel like theyre really OP if you let them focus on just one thing after a while compared to the Force user. So as a GM really encourage them to diversify their character between social combat and technical capabilities. ,swrpg,dc3xgpu,4,t5_2vzmi

Once there a rival slips something in your drink which on a normal day youd have shaken off with little effect but after the day youve had knocks you out.  Or maybe you didnt even make it to the party because you passed out on the way over it was extremely hot and humid out.Another way to us strain and keep it relevant is to use it as an exhaustion meter.  Your player needs to accomplish Goal X at the end of several encounters.  If they run out of strain before they get to that encounter they are too exhausted to do what needs to be done and hit the bunk early.I have found that the best way to strain out a player is to keep them on a tight schedule just like in real life.

Rogue One outlines their first major battle with the empire and there could only be more to come as we get closer to Hoth in Episode V. I prefer to keep my campaigns distanced from the Civil War. Maybe do odd jobs for the Rebels evade the authorities and the like. Maybe they get caught up in a local propaganda campaign and decide to help the rebels by bringing news of the DS destruction? Maybe there is some remnant of the Inquisitorius that learns about the boy? Maybe they get caught in with the Hutts and inevitably against the Empire.

The navigational data is supposed to be well protected.Naturally the mechanic decides to try and slice into the shuttle nav computer and get it. Some red dice are thrown into the mix and half the party freaks out. They know what despair means getting dumped out in the middle of a nebula their hard work wasted. The mechanic goes for it anyway....and rolls double triumphs. She gets the nav data and I tell her she has complete control over where the shuttle and their transport come out of hyperspace which does not have to be in the same place. The shuttle continues on to its planned destination and the their transport comes out of hyperspace on the far side of the planet. As far as the Empire is concerned the transport ship suffered a malfunction and was lost in hyperspace. They get to sneak their way into a topsecret base that doesnt think theres even a chance of intruders right now.,swrpg,ddbwk73,1,t5_2vzmi
10651378,0,t3_5s6e42,You pretty much nailed it. Mathematically the difficulty increase of upgrading a purple difficulty dice to a red challenge dice is on pair with just adding a setback dice while adding a difficulty dice is roughly equal to two setback dice. So your main source of increasing the simple difficulty of a check should be setback dice and if more is required increasing the difficulty itself. Challenge dice you basically only need if the check has some inherent dangers which might lead to despair.The best example is how flying fast in difficult terrain will upgrade and upgrade the difficulty to a certain degree and after you reached half your ships silhouette become just more difficult the faster you go because the catastrophic consequences are already included in the dice pool in form of the challenge dice.  The bigger and faster the ship the higher the odds for catastrophic consequences and the more severe those consequences can be   The more counter attack potential  there are in an opposed check the more red dice.  You can apply the same for basically all skill checks the more boobytraps are involved in this skullduggery check or mechanic or computer check to pick that door the more challenge dice you add. The more potential lethal ways to fall to your death on your athletics or coordination check the more upgrades to challenge dice are a good idea. They dont increase the difficulty massively but they increase the danger and they have as well a psychological effect on the players as they mark danger from despair and critical failure. Well and they usually can not be negated by talents or gear like most setback dice can.  edit Big plunder typo mixed up challenge and setback dice in one sentence,swrpg,ddelvw6,1,t5_2vzmi

10701891,0,t1_ddj4i3t,You should always max characteristics when the character is first created. Heres why depending on how your group plays you should look for  to  xp per session. So to raise a stat from a  to a  youd need  or  play session without improving your character. For that same amount of XP  you could purchase ! talents from the first row. So if you spend all xp on stats then at the end of the first session you should be able to add between  and  new talents.Its also better this way because you never really know how a game plays. So getting just the super basic stuff  to strain or  to toughness as well as some generic weapon skill improvements is the way to go. Then if you discover that you need more X you can get it at the end of the first session.If you stack your talents at creation you may discover that the neat thing your character can do isnt really useful in your campaign.I hope you guys have fun!,swrpg,ddjtjwc,2,t5_2vzmi

10813929,0,t3_5unj46,I upgrade in  situations  I can instantly and reasonably think of a meaningful reason why a Despair would trigger a specific effect in the roll. For a simple example ... if a character is jumping off the roof of a three story building and wanting to land on hisher feet and sprint after the bad guy. Well ... its pretty obvious that a particularly bad drop could result in something like a broken ankle ... so ... lets throw a red die in and say x difficult with  red ... because if you roll a despair youre going to break your ankle.  The players have been using their Destiny Points or the game started heavily slanted Dark for Destiny Points. In this case I will often  but not always  upgrade otherwise inconsequential rolls  such as perception when the players are paranoid but no one is actually around ... and thats fun cause now theyre even more paranoid . I try to reward appropriate use of Destiny Points by giving them back to players in this way.  When a trained skill of an NPC should make a roll more difficult. For example when trying to bluff through a security checkpoint ... the NPC being bluffed generally has a trained Cool  Discipline skill and red dice should be used to represent their level of training. Also adversaries. So ... basically ... this one is the one youve spoken about in your post.,swrpg,ddvdplw,16,t5_2vzmi

10883621,0,t1_de0zc2u,The player taking strain for using the weapon is appropriate then wounds feels like too much IMO.You could have the player periodically make Fear checks as the blade is communicating with them on some level through the Force and all it wants is blood even when the PC is only surrounded by allies.Another option could be that every now and then have the PC make Cool checks to notice things going on around them and if they fail they stay focused on the task they are doing not noticing their ally needing help because the sabers dark energy is compelling them to attack.Another option could be like LotR the weapon is only so powerful in the hands of anyone but its creator.

11294352,0,t1_dfc0z52,Im just a novice player but what do you think about using Triumphs on checks to add facts?A knowledge Warfare check on the enemys weapons with a triumph might reveal to you that one of the enemy has used up all the ammunition is his weapon. Or observing a patrol with a Triumph might gain you the knowledge that they are about to do a shift change which creates a window of opportunity. A triumph in a check on the terrain advantages might remind you of a battle you recall from your history of warfare class in which one side gained the upper hand by using their position in front of the setting sun to rush the blinded enemy giving setback die to enemy attacks?I think knowledge checks seem to have the greatest opportunity as far as introducing character supplied input to the game.,swrpg,dfc75t6,2,t5_2vzmi

11665277,0,t3_66dhgk,RolePlaying Games in general are super intimidating to get into. They are completely different from all other types of games. They are not as strictly defined in what can be done and what cannot be done and they have a GM who is responsible for governing the game world. Its a dynamic that most people are not accustomed to and that takes a little bit of getting used to being a part of.I cannot tell you that SWRPG wont be intimidating if you just follow this one weird trick. Its going to be intimidating at least the first  times you play. The best thing I can say is ... dont worry about it too much. RPGs are primarily about collectively telling a story and having fun. If youre doing that youre doing it right ... even if you mess up some of the rules or forget some things that should have been included according to the books.Once you get into the swing of things its HIGHLY likely that youll reread portions of the rules and find that you technically did things wrong. At that point talk together as a group and say do we want to change it to the right way going forward or do we like the way weve been doing it so far better? ... and make the decision together. If you continue the wrong way thats ok. Its YOUR group and YOUR table.,swrpg,dgi9vtg,3,t5_2vzmi
11706803,0,t1_dgmt3wp,Dont split the party is such a gamy dichotomy imo. Read any book watch any movie play any game and characters there will at one point split up to do things more efficiently. You can keep your characters in one blob connected to each other by ethereal chains if you prefer but youre losing a lot of potential plot points and realism.When I say you I dont necessarily mean you in particular because you indicate you do not do those things. Avoiding splitting up the party when its not going to add anything is fine but making it taboo is... well also fine because your table your fun your rules  but imo a game is better when a GM can play that way and pull it off.As far as getting bored is concerned... the scenario described would take less than  minutes and youre cutting between parts of the group as you speak Stealther breaks in through the back door Im inside now. You guys? Oh yeah were coming up to the door now keep going and report in every minute on the clock. Party talks their way past the front door. Stealth guy sneaks towards his next objective.

Even if itd be  uninterrupted stealth moment seeing as its literally going to be only  minutes and the partys entire plan  the setup for their next actions depends on it Id expect them to have the attention span.
