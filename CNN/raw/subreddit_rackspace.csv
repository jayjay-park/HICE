Rackspace has been a tumultuous place over the last few years as they figure out whats realistic for them to achieve in the market and what is not.  I think they finally have settled back into a realistic mission and ironically the most obvious one along  supporting customers well.

HP is not.,rackspace,cqb9jmx,2,t5_2sdem
