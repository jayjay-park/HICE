11674835,0,t3_6622wn, This is ASH. Its pretty useful. From what I could see good part of the information in Fringes FAQ comes from ASH. You really can find anything in there from how to slit your wrists properly so you do not cut a tendon to the lethal doses of some sleeping pills. Theyre also pretty realistic. Most of them try to show you how hard it is to successfully commit suicide chances are youll just fail and feel worse with the consequences. ASH discouraged me and Im expecting more people to be discouraged as well. Still some pretty useful information though. ,methodsforsuicide,dgjcxdu,2,t5_2wmtx
