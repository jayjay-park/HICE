6377106,0,t3_42t5dm,One key for the baseball game is that running speed matters probably more than it should. Im looking to fix that. But I would just focus on those players and you should see a turnaround.Power can hurt batting average. So sometimes teams of great OVR players can struggle to get men on base.Edit Ballparks dont matter right now.,ZenGMBaseball,czeia1w,1,t5_31nkq
8517113,0,t1_d65r94t,Leaderboard fixed! v.The leaderboard shouldnt show position players now. However it still doesnt filter as well as the FIP category.I changed the code to better ensure hitters dont pitch. However some still seem to get an inning here and there. Not sure if that is due to extreme injuries on RPs or something else. So Ill need to look into that further. However not being in the leaderboard will make it less obvious and annoying for now.,ZenGMBaseball,d66767n,1,t5_31nkq
