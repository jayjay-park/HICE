End point is up at the Vinewood sign. It is a GTA race so I littered the runway with rocket pickups and health packs. The rules are simpleOnce you start the race you cannot proceed to the finish line until you have  stars.Typically we start off get rockets and get out on the road to start blowing up vehicles. This brings in the police. Then we run around the runway just tearing up cops getting more stars.You can engage other players but it is not really advantageous as you still want to acheive the best time on the race possible  minutes or so is averageHere is a video my first run through with this.

956190,0,t1_chbsdhn,To break it down further a turbo makes your engine do more work burn more fuel and air produce more power. The increase in power will equate to a faster acceleration time but top speed in a car is limited by more than just the engines output. Drag friction on the tyres and loss of power in the transfer between parts will also play a part in determining the top speed. For example there is no streetlegal tyre that can safely exceed mph. Another example would be the original Mini. The shape of the car meant that it was aerodynamically limited to mph. You could put hp in the car and all it would do is serve to get the car to mph faster.With most modern IRL cars though they are not reaching their limits so turbocharging them would in most cases lead to a higher top speed as well as faster acceleration.Edit If were being really nitpicky though all the turbo does is force more air into the engine. The other thing the engine needs to burn is fuel. So in order to keep the same fuel to air ratio that the engine needs in order to work you need to add more fuel. How you do this is by telling the fuel injection system to work harder. However most injectors fitted on standard cars would need to upgraded to match the turbo. Also the engine cooling would usually need to be upgraded and if youre talking about really big power stronger engine internals too. So if it were hyperrealistic youd roll into LS Customs and have your turbo fitted but you wouldnt see the real benefit until you had upgraded several other parts and changed the engine management. TLDR The parts all work together.,GTAV,chcz6yz,2,t5_2rjys

They have actual DLC planned but this GTAO is a massive project that has never been tried before. People should respect what they have done the scope is truly amazing. And the updates are actually pretty steady. Overall Id say its easily an A game but everyone acts like they havent gotten their monies worth. R have not let us down in anything other than time tables really. And Im sure they want heists just as bad as we do. They cant play them until they are made either you know they aint magic.

If the crew caps at  I delete about  from muscle who dont rep the crew or obviously dont know English or get on too much.

They also included what seems to be a pretty clear reference to the Team Gents shirt with this update AND some of the devs did a Lets Play with the AH guys.

2637028,0,t3_2q4dt5,I had almost the identical problem in xbox one. My problem was I was going to the xbox dashboard and shutting down the console to quit. Well it doesnt actually quit it goes into a sleep like mode. This was allowing me to resume the game exactly where I left off which is cool whether I was in SP or MP. If I resumed in MP it would have to re synch my data since I clearly couldnt just go instantly into multiplayer. This is where the problem was stemming from. You have to actually Quit the game and THEN power down the system. That way the system will boot up GTAV fresh and download all the proper information and not make me go through prolog or transfer my character again. This was a  fix for me on XB.

The PSversion is a lot more beautiful to watch especially plants and trees and unlike the PSversion it provides a great diversity of verhicles on the roads which is something I really enjoy. Also the possibility of playing in FirstPersonMode makes you perceive the world quite differently so you dont have the feeling of just replaying the same game.

3127877,0,t3_2vsv72,For my money its worth the upgrade. The game looks appreciably better first person is fun to play in when you feel like it and Online is better with more people. Thats not to say its all positives. I primarily play story mode and the fact that you now have to findbuy all the DLC carsguns that used to be free is pretty annoying to me. Personally I think the game could do a better job of pointing out the new additions from lastgen. I know there are a considerable number of additions but because I havent taken hours to comb through every inch of the map most of it might as well not be there. The big question is how much you like GTA Online. If you only play story mode the upgrade isnt nearly as vital. If you play a lot of Online its more worth it. DLC is the wildcard. Some will probably be crossgen but what wont is a mystery and I personally would hate to miss out. For  it probably should come down to either A I really love GTA V and want to replay it with better graphicsin HD or B I am committed to GTA Online. If you can find it around  Id recommend getting it regardless. ,GTAV,com7avj,1,t5_2rjys

Instead all you essentially have to do is fuck around long enough and youll be rewarded for it. GTA is a massively popular game and the reality is that means every casual player every moron every little kid and their grandmother is playing it. You can almost never be sure if your random is any good actually it would be best to just assume they suck. Because  times out of  that is going to be the case.What I do now for heists if I cant get  other friends together is send the random party invites. If they cant be arsed to join my party and chat theyre kicked.

Edit I seemed to have confused. I meant I throttled my downloading speed so that I spent more time watching steam download it than not. I also stopped the download when I wasnt at home. Reason being is that if it was finished then everything is just sitting there. So I did this to create a sense of excitement and anticipation. ,GTAV,cq7fg0v,12,t5_2rjys

3647062,0,t1_cq7l4nr,Haha Ive always wanted to do that. Nothing personal of course it just bugs me when people comment agreed without saying anything else. Its like they think its a super upvote or something.But yeah I think the push for  only started because people realized what a pain in the ass it was at first to get four randoms together through the autoinvite. You cant really blame them for capitalizing on it it even goes along with the spirit of the game in a way. Thing is theyve improved the autoinvite since then and now its pretty easy to just replace people if they decide to hold out. Plus theres a timer which no one seems to notice. If people dont ready up the heist starts itself after about five minutes. Keeping all that in mind I dont really feel like crew members have a strong negotiating position to try to get leaders to raise the default cut. I take the  they give me most of the time and if they try to lower it I just laugh at them and leave. As far as me leading Ive noticed a pattern...the guys who hold out are always the ones who fuck up. I could only speculate as to why that is but the pattern exists. When someone starts demanding extra its a huge red flag to me as far as them being a liability in the field so to speak. Its more about that than the money tbh. ,GTAV,cq7zqgq,2,t5_2rjys

I actually did this last night to a kid.  Driving around in my Karina Armored and this level  something just blows me up with a rocket launcher for no reason.  It happens people are dicks but I felt like getting him back.  So I called my insurance had my mechanic bring my car and drove towards him again didnt even shoot and he blew me up again.  Now im laughing cause this kid has spent Gs to kill me.  So i change out my Entity FX which has a G insurance and go after him again letting him blow it up.  By the time he got the idea of what I was doing he had spent over Gs to kill me like  times.

However here were a few strategiestips I used when I was your age and wanted gamesmedia my parents felt I shouldnt have. Id try and show them the game. Usually the inappropriateness is much worse in the imagination of parents then the actuality. I could never get my parents to play a game with me but I could show them clipsgameplay.  Offer to try and earn it in any way. Say Hey mom this is a game I really would enjoy playing in the future are there things I can do to try and earn that priviledge?. It can help to show youre willing to put in good effort. Discuss conditions.

4047530,0,t1_crgshtw,I agree with you in principle but Rockstar really fucked up in several areas of the Online.  The player count per session. The Just Cause  multiplayer mod has proven that servers could easily handle hundreds and even thousands of people in the same session and while that would be chaotic I dont see why we couldnt have  players in the same session. The loading screens. Every time you join a game mode leave a game mode and even when you fail to enter a game mode because its full you get a loading screen and not a short one either even on PC. It makes you lose so much time. Matchmaking sucks. This is less of a problem on PC but I played the console version with a friend and realized how long it takes to even find people to play with unless its the heist finale in which case the lobby is filled before you can accept the invitation.,GTAV,crhne6k,1,t5_2rjys

4279197,0,t3_39zv98,Hey there so I posted this to the steam forums. I had some issues starting GTA V on my windows  machine. I found that the installer for the launchersocial club update thought that GTA V is not installed on this computer. I detailed the method on the steam forum but the gist is that you add the launcher patch executable to the installers directory in the gta v folder. Then add the launcher patch as a process to the installscript.vdf in the main gta v folder. The game will still give the same gta v not found error but will start after some time loading both off and online. Hope that helps anyone stuck like me.

At the moment no one is getting banned on any platform but I honestly expect a massive ban wave to roll out eventually if the modder uses your bros account to run the script then rockstar will be able to see that. He cant claim innocence since on their end they can see hes running scripts some are easer to get away with but personally its not worth the risk.

6735112,0,t1_d0fwg8m,I think youre partially correct here. Using abusive language and profanity isnt really ideal when youre dealing with anyone as all it typically does is create a sense of anger when someone feels as if theyre being personally insulted. However this use of profanity is important as it portrays the users frustration. All hes asking for is a fix and with each regurgitated post that the support representative gives him creates and even bigger sense of  dissatisfaction. If everything was neatly and kindly worded as youd like Rockstar would have little incentive to actively and quickly look for a fix for the issue as it could be determined as a passive problem only affecting a small portion of users. Sometimes the best way to gain traction and quicken communication with a hugely profitable company like Rockstar is to cause disruption. For example think of Valve theyre renowned for their extremely poor customer service. The only times they ever do anything to fix problems at haste is when there is a large call for it from the user base and even then the majority of times they dont care.Sometimes things need to get worse before they get better.,GTAV,d0fywip,7,t5_2rjys

Ghz Q quad core. it does great in games that utilize multicore threading and is pretty shit in everything else. anyways I play GTA in p with most everything turned up pretty high and on the low end get about  fps which is pretty shit but its playable frames are only this low when driving through the city. i turn everything down and maybe get  fps but the  extra frames arent worth the game looking like poop. i tried all the frame scaling settings and it made literally no change in fps. so in my case I assume that I am CPU capped. people should still try it anyways it only takes a moment to try it out.,GTAV,d5vou4r,2,t5_2rjys

11519557,0,t1_dg14cq3,what I have in mind is like a Hub kinda place where a bunch of people gather to matchmake for races or get invited to one with the matchmaking ones having a big screen to those who are ingame and next to that a list of those ready for next round with an option to spectate. For the point of it I would say have custom outfit unlocks or cars without the overpricing but only earned with racing currency. I mean Different game modes regarding cars and all idk Im thinking big like PC and grouping together mods that ive seen from other games Gmod and that one San Andreas Custom theft auto this post was meant to imagine lol ,GTAV,dg1qrsu,1,t5_2rjys

11674472,0,t1_dgiw8ph,gt If you want collections to export and get bonus money they require mid and standard range vehicles.The Collections use all  unique vehicles  Standard  Mid and  Top Range. The very first Collection youll see on your warehouse computer contains an X T and Osiris  all top range vehiclesgt Dont think there is a way to force getting top range carsActually there is. Firstly you dont want to fill your warehouse you only want one of each type of vehicle in your warehouse at most. As mentioned above theres  unique vehicles. When you have all  with no duplicates youll need to sell those duplicates for this to work and you sell a top range vehicle the next car you source will be the same top range vehicle. Put simply when sourcing vehicles the game firstly tries to give you what you dont already have. When you have all  and source another it becomes completely random. So if you have all  cars and no more then sell an X the next car you source will be an X. If you have obtained the Collection I mentioned above and sell it the next car you sell will be either an X T or Osiris. ,GTAV,dgjbg1k,2,t5_2rjys
