9463791,0,t1_d9fl9x0,I think I was wrong here I didnt realize what I was actually doing was holding them down  way and then on the lip i was completely depressing and releasing at the last moment so the animation didnt change all that much. I havent verified this is exactly what I was doing yet but I watched my own stream and noticed I was depressing then releasing on takeoff.,Infinite_air,d9floqb,1,t5_3h7ow

10107373,0,t1_dbolcoq,On top of what the others wrote...the mountains are generated and when the users changed the initial generator wordMount Infinite its completely different. If you just want to drop in a random mountain which is really steep use the generator and play around with the settings then enter some random word or string or use the random button. Place some ramps and rails on interesting places and have fun.,Infinite_air,dbp0328,2,t5_3h7ow
