There are also the regular version which have the correct colorsmines are slightly altered due to being the special versions without the wings. Those are like half the price of these.

6810990,0,t3_48zfh1,I think just the original robotech dub is more iconic. They did redub it with the original Macrosss Minmei speaking English but the rest of the cast was also dubbed by other people. So for the early memories involved I just couldnt watch more then a few episodes with the new voices.,macross,d0obmqg,2,t5_2smuz

7658850,0,t1_d3c4u0c,gtgtnot thrilled about the stickersThis is what worries me about the  model coming out next month. The color pattern on the Siegfrieds are pretty complex with a lot of coverage but not quite a enough coverage where you could see them justifying making the parts any particular color. So unless Bandai has developed a way to mold pieces in multiple colors which would pretty much make them gods of the modeling world IMO we are either looking at a shit ton of waterslides or a shit ton of paint needed.,macross,d3crngb,0,t5_2smuz

8028062,0,t1_d4h6h1b,I dont think Hayates parents are somebody weve met but I think his dad definitely played an important role in Windermeres past.In episode  Arad says that somebody would be proud of Hayate if he could see him now.  Im guessing that hes referring to his dad.  Now he revealed that he also knew the king and fought against him during the war  years ago.Hayates crystal was sent to him while his dad was on some random planet.  A crystal that synchronizes with Freyja perfectly.Im willing to bet his dad was involved with whatever created that huge crater in Windermere and hes probably one of the men in the picture of Ernest and the king when he was young.,macross,d4ifgvl,1,t5_2smuz

8577044,0,t1_d6do4yh,the arcadiayamato stuff and the bandai DX stuff are both . Arcadiayamato has all the classic stuff from SDFM through Macross . From Frontier on its all bandai and now bandai is starting to do some SDFM era stuff with their regult glaug and the monster. FYI theres some ver  yamato and DX stuff still out there for cheap. Stay away from them theyre both garbage. For the DX stuff make sure its the renewal releases for the  and . For yamatoarcadia the vf vf yf all have a ver  in the  scale. edit also the bandai himetal stuff is  for the  it has to be their DX brand. ,macross,d6dppk1,2,t5_2smuz

9456805,0,t3_5a7rng,The Macross Saga in Robotech and SDF Macross are almost identical in story and tone some fan service and more gore in the Japanese version that was cut because they werent kid friendly in the States plus the edits to the story they had to make in the Robotech version to sew all three series together and even most of the music is the same in both.The voice acting is actually petty decent in the Robotech version if you want to skip the subtitles in OG Macross even though the voice acting is superior in OG Macross in my opinion.  You can even find OG Macross dubbed but in my opinion if you are going to go that route the acting is better in Robotech.,macross,d9epu1c,2,t5_2smuz

10579412,0,t1_dd761pf,On the contrary military action is always a vehicle towards peace. Because humans are weak creatures and conflict is part of our evolutionary biology. The military conflict matters in all cases except for Delta. That was the first show where military action was most meaningless to ongoing developments.In Frontier the Vajra conflict was more akin to first contact in a hostile universe. The Vajra wanted to understand humans and the humans too. But the two species are empathically different and it took lots of fighting and loss before an understanding could be reached. Ultimately even through understanding the resolution was that the Vajra would leave behind their world for humans in return for peace and the expression of emotion via song.Honestly Frontiers lesson was the most mature that sometimes conflict can be phyrric and that not all stories end perfectly. At the end of the TV series the Vajra fled but Frontier itself crashed into the planet with most of the inner city destroyed and the fleet itself run ragged. In the movies the price paid was Alto giving himself up for peace and Sheryl signing herself into a coma to get the message across that humanity didnt want to fight in the first place. It wasnt about peace but that the entire conflict was not one that Frontier wanted. And that humans are empathically unlike Vajra that one sect does not represent all.,macross,dd76mzs,5,t5_2smuz
