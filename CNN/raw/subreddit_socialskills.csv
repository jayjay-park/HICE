8109,0,t3_1u70hy,I used to have this happen to me at work cashier. Sometimes it would  happen when seeing a cute girl in line and thinking to myself dont blush dont blush. I dont have any reason to blush so dont turn red. As anticipation grew as they would cone closer and closer Id turn red and act awkward.  The most frustrating part of this is that you arent in control as it seems. What I think can help is practicing meditation.  Im not talking about meditation for religious or spiritual purposes but just to relieve anxiety which plays an important part on why blushing occurs. You will feel so much less stress and pressure everyday and you always feel at ease. Check out rmeditation to get started if you arent familiar with it.  It can be difficult at first with keeping intrusive thoughts away but it gets easier in no time. There are some great HowTo YouTube videos available as well. Another factor that I believe plays a role is confidence and selfesteem. Start working out. When you work out you feel great after. If you arent familiar with fitness bodybuilding.com is a great resource to guide you through exercises. Hope this helps. ,socialskills,cefcy8g,2,t5_2r275
8868,0,t3_1u85k3,First of all let me start by saying that nobody is going to invite you out if there is nothing you bring to the table. Why dont you invite them out to do something fun? Play pool bowling or go to watch a movie are some options. Also if you could loosen up and be more talkative. Other guys also liike to hangout with guys who are good with females... I dont know its a guy thing. so if you do get to go out with them eventually you can also strike convos with strangers. small talk is really powerful.

71952,0,t3_1uwn6a, You can find people with similar interests its easier to talk about stuff youre into. When you talk about stuff youre passionate about people tend to listen just to be clear this isnt video games this is real hobbies. Another thing you can do is talk to customer service reps or anyone who has to be polite to customers at work to build up confidence. If you dont have anything to talk about then ask people about themselves. A persons favorite word is their name and everyone loves talking about themselves especially when you ask them to. This doesnt mean ask them pointless questions find shit that you actually wanna know about.  Maybe dont say that youre ugly and look awkward. Thats not a healthy attitude towards yourself. You can be Brad fucking Pitt but if you dont carry yourself with a certain amount of confidence your looks wont go too far.  You probably dont work out...start. Youll look better youll feel better.  Lastly...youre probably coming out of highschool with these predetermined ideas of what cool is and all that shit. That the hot chicks will go for you only if youre hotathleteetc But here in the post HS world people tend to care less about that shit. They care about interests and hobbies and experiences. Dont make your life about finding a girl or trying to attract people. Find what youre passionate about and pursue it and everything else will fall in place in time. ,socialskills,cemmcqq,3,t5_2r275

123648,0,t3_1vi0yv,First of all the best social skill you can have is confidence in yourself. People on here always sound so pathetic. You need to be confident in yourself and have a good selfesteem and people will automatically want to be friends with you AND talking to strangerschicks will become much easier.Now to address your specific problem. Are you telling me that do absolutely nothing except music? You have no other hobbies? Reading Video Games Collecting Watching Sports You did say you ski and you like music so I guess that is something but I would suggest also finding other hobbies. There should be some clubs related to music so you should definitely join if you want to meet new people.If you want to be more social in general I would suggest joining a Frat or going to parties but you said you like being by yourself. Yet you are trying to be more social so it is a bit confusing. Personally I doubt you actually like being by yourself and in that case I would suggest what I have said so far meet new people and have fun. College is what you make of it because everyone starts out fresh nobody has a bad reputation so you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.,socialskills,cesifjo,0,t5_2r275

238659,0,t3_1wtwgp,Hey. I feel you man. Almost as if everyone on campus has banded up and become friends with each other and theyre just not open for business anymore. If only you got there sooner. And if only something could fix the broken parts about you so that youd be good enough to be friends with these people.I can fix you!I can tell you right now youre not as unfriendable as you think you are.   Im going to tell you two things that you can do to turn this around. These are basic things that all those people in the clubs are doing that help them make friends. If you follow this advice I promise youll be welcomed right in as a part of the group. If you dont youll just remain lonely  probably even more lonely as time goes on.First part Change how you speak to yourself. I can tell by your script that you dont think very highly of yourself. Ill be you dont even blame your friends for ignoring you. Remember youre an amazing dude. Start speaking to and about yourself as if you were the person you most admire. Love yourself. Acknowledge the parts that you love about yourself often. Several times a day.Everyone will follow your lead. Love yourself think that youre the greatest  and everyone else will do the same.Second part Get into the habit of giving without asking for something back. How would you feel about a total stranger who walks up to you hands you  and walks away? How would you feel about a total stranger who gives a genuine compliment to you and walks away without expecting one back? How would you feel about a total stranger who sees you smiles and gives you a high five as you walk back?Fucking awesome right?Get into the habit of saying hello to people or smiling to them or offering a compliment Hey you should know thats a crazy nice shirt youre wearing. or helping with them if they look like theyre struggling with something. Paying for the coffee of the person behind you in line.Just give away kindness constantly. Be constantly generous and ask for nothing back.A person who loves himself and is sincerely generous is insanely attractive. You will be claimed and invited everywhere. Everyone will love you.Good luck!,socialskills,cf5hkmx,16,t5_2r275

And that being said the responsibility is on her as well.

Its a relief to have some extroverts in place as social lubricant for larger gatherings.For me I really suppose it just comes down to the size of the group or social gathering. Where I feel most sociable is in small groups. It doesnt really matter if the others are introverted or not at that point although this is how I typically socialize with other introvertswho are usually my friends on the basis of something intellectual.One of my favorite ways to get to know people is to go on a hike. It makes for a perfectly sized group of people and doing something strenuous makes for periods of silence that feel completely natural.

Not just How so? or Really? They reflect back the other peoples statement and then try to ask a question that will take it further. This creates engagement and makes you more appealing to others because you really listen.  If they dont have something interesting to say about themselves they pick a topic they suspect everyone can relate to. Ex. Dont talk about your WOW account. Do talk about things you have to do to relieve stress from work. Whatever they say is with confidence. They dont speak in questions everything they say ends with the pitch going higher... annoying.

768308,0,t3_22yewk,Well first off I hate meeting friends outside if where usually need to meet them. If I dont know you that well but youre in my class or job then Id just like to keep you in that area. Anywhere outside of that can be awkward at best.With that being said when I see someone coming down a corridor of some sort I tend to greet them when Im say ft away from them. The greet is usually just a smile accompanied with hello. However if its someone I know male friend Ill usually just stare at them and do a quick whats up nod. Once were within arms reach of each other well usually shake hands or do a secret handshake! But that walking up to them point Ill just look away at something else until I get close enough to greet them.If I happen to run into a person that I already greeted at a grocery store which almost always happens Ill just throw a quick smile at them and then carry on with my business. Or sometimes just not mind them at all unless they insinuate the smile.A good lesson to learn is to never make any situation awkward no matter how awkward you think itll be. Only you can create the awkwardness for yourself. And dont think much of it man! Overthinking things is based on your perception of a perfect scenario. And we all know that nothing is ever perfect.

1019218,0,t3_25rsgf,I had to take off some time for financial reasons and after a change in major the combined effect was that I graduated college  years after graduating high school. Almost none of the people I started school with were there by the end including my best friend. However I did meet plenty of new people along the way including my wife of nearly  years now and had I not had the path that I did I probably would never have met her.Honestly it is great that you have a renewed focus on getting your education in your chosen area of study. It is likely that you will excel and have better future opportunities as a result. You will meet many people like yourself who are either a bit older or just less interested in the college experience.  That doesnt mean that you wont find people who you will be able to socialize with outside of studying  to the contrary they want to do fun things occasionally just as you do. However they are much more likely to be more mature about it and have their priorities in line vs. your average freshman.Over time you will probably find that some of your old friends have moved on some will be around and may have been delayed a bit on their own and some may be just as excited to see you as you are to see them. Whatever the case may be you will definitely meet many new people and have many new experiences share some inside jokes and generally get along just fine.In short dont worry about fitting in  make your own space and youll soon find yourself happily accompanied by those who have similar sensibilities.,socialskills,chk54ni,3,t5_2r275

1027933,0,t1_chkyqqa,Personally I like to shuffle to EDM. Dubstep is easy cuz you can just rock with the wubs. Trap and hip hop are the most fun imo cuz you can pretty much do anything you want. Dougie jerk cat daddy twerk etc. Its hard for me to elaborate here because there isnt a specific name for how I dance. I just... dance. Most of the moves just come to me once I hear the music. My advice to you is to practice dancing alone. Find a mirror crank that music up and just dance until you start making new moves up. Do whatever makes you feel like a boss. Also next time you see a good dancer in the club just memorize some of his moves. I did this a lot when I first started to dance and eventually put my own flair to it. Becoming a good dancer takes practice but contrary to popular belief you dont need tutorials to learn how to dance. Just get in front of a mirror and experiment. Most importantly have fun with it!

If you dont know anything about the subject it gives you an opportunity to learn and them an opportunity to share which gives people confidence and some sort of social validation. If you are familiar with the subject or willing to be youve got an opportunity to connect which is the second thing. Its all about finding things in common. This is why most people say join some sort of organized group doing an activity youre interested in to make friends. Youve already got that connection with everyone there. You just have to find someone who is open to making new friends. Keep inviting people out. You will eventually get a bite sort of like asking girls out.

Its a selffulfilling prophecy. If you look smart and you act like a stick stuck on a mud then yeah she will look try to take advantage of your assets which is your brains. If you looked rich and you are similarly socially stiff then your friends will find a way to take advantage of you financially. Friendship isnt something perfectly amazing. Friends are friends TO GET SOMETHING. Believe it or not the thing you want from your friend is validation. If you didnt need that you will be looking to get something else from them. Friendship is a give and take relationship. The best type of friendship is the type where you have a good time off of each other. What does that mean? You give her a fun time she gives you a fun time and everyone feels good in the end  at that point everything else is just icing on the cake i.e. you sometimes help her with homework or she sometimes gives you a ride. If both of you are not fun then DUH of course you will both look for something else to get from each other. That is when the friendship looks cutthroat. So basically she is trying to get homework from you and you are trying to get validation from her. The solution? Try to relax socially. How do you relax socially? By enjoying yourself? How do you enjoy yourself by not focusing on stupid things. How do you stop focusing on stupid things? By being able to say no to asshole like this girl but not make things awkward. Trust me I say no to people all the time and they love me for it. ,socialskills,ci3kclo,1,t5_2r275

1464487,0,t3_2ax9s3,Great post. I think your last paragraph is bang on. If someone is rude when you first introduce yourself theyre either really shy and dont know how to deal with it or there is something wrong with their personality. They dont know how to follow the rules of social interaction. If someone approaches you with a smile and a handshake any sane person will acknowledge and appreciate that chance to make a connection. Im not shy and Ive never really had any bad experiences with meeting people the exceptions are always people who are obviously really uncomfortable with themselves so they act aloof as a defense mechanism. But my SO is really shy and Ive noticed it doesnt get in her way so here is a tip from what Ive observed If youre nervous when meeting people try to smile. If you have an awkward smile that turns people off practice an apologetic sort of genuine smile. You dont have to say much if youre shy just make sure to be conscious of your body language and the vibe youre giving off. To people that dont know you shyness can look just like rudeness if youre not careful. But even if youre nervous in social situations most people will understand and look past it as long as you still try to look friendly and open. ,socialskills,cizukuc,6,t5_2r275
1477688,0,t3_2b2e2t,There are many different ways Ive thought of approaching this in a comment but Ill take a jab at one point and hopefully go from there. This will probably come out a little fragmented as Im still learning all about this myself. Believe me when I say this it is possible to reach that level you feel when you are drunk without any substances whatsoever. My first approach will be in light of your shyness. Before that we need to figure out exactly what shyness is there are whole books on this but Ill give you the rundown. Shyness is a learned behavior. As you grow up a certain part of your brain associates certain experiences with either something good or something bad for example if you ride a bike for the first time and fall your brain would associate riding a bike with pain bad and you would never want to do it again. The only way to get over it would be to ride the bike again regardless until you didnt fall ignoring the fear and just doing it anyways. The lesson we can take from this is that you can only unlearn past experiences with new ones ones that cause anxiety or fear but result in a positive experience. As a side note you obviously seem very fragmented in what you think how could you not have any interest in talking with people if doing so makes you feel like you are ruining your life? What you are feeling is completely emotional you can seldom control it as it runs on a level way below your conscious thought process and no amount of reasoning could change it. Now lets get on with what is causing you to seem uninterestedshy when it comes to other people. In the past youve probably had bad experiences with talking to people and as a result you close yourself off to avoid disapproval. What does this mean exactly? Well back in the days of Cavemen time disapproval from a superior would mean you would be kicked out of your tribe and being alone meant certain death. This eventually developed through evolution into what you are now experiencing. Because you have had experiences where someone else showed disapproval in the past your brain will avoid opening up because to it disapproval is equivalent to death itself. Anyways Ive been writing for almost an entire hour now and its way past my bedtime. Ill write the second part on how you can actually start changing yourself. You are on a path to change good luck.For the meantimeDont think about it too hardDont think that anything is wrong with you many people experience this very same thingRemember you can get better at social skills like you can at any skillIll be back for part ...Source The Shyness and Social Anxiety System by Sean Cooper I  recommend you read this its a life changer. ,socialskills,cj1i5uw,1,t5_2r275

1486369,0,t1_cj2kd9p,Best advice I can give is if you truly want to change yourself  as in improve your sense of esteem  then dedicate yourself to it as your lifes work. Because there is no quick fix. This is why people do drugs because they feel like those feelings are the fix they need to repair their damaged esteem or social skills. I can speak from experience on all of this. It takes years and the drugs just give a temporary illusion of health. Building a healthy esteem is the quest for the holy grail.There are a lot of ways to build a healthy sense of esteem. I prefer the tripart method which is  Work on your selftalk. When you speak to yourself speak to yourself with kindness and encouragement as if you are your best most loyal friend. You would be amazed at how switching from speaking awful to yourself all the time really gives a wounded esteem a respite from selfflagellation. Be a coach a mentor the parent you wish you had to yourself. This also helps you build selfdiscipline which can help you achieve other awesome things throughout the rest of your life.  Its amazing what people can achieve when their sense of esteem is healthy  Surround yourself with people who honestly care about you and show it in healthy ways. This is anyone from friends mentors family members. If they are hurtful to you be honest with yourself about that. Honesty is really important in having a healthy relationship with your self  or really with anyone or anything. So if you find the people around you are subtly undermining you give them some distance. Make sure you are spending your time life with people who think youre really cool and an ejoyable person to be around. And...take a good look at yourself  are you an enjoyable person to be around? Honestly? Because if there are some habits youve developed as a reaction to a low self esteem those habits need to go too. What is your outlook on life? Cynical? Do you always have something negative to say? Are you cold and standoffish? Im not saying youre any of these things I am using them to illustrate a point that a sense of poor self esteem has behavioral consequences that sometimes manifest as defensive or negative interactions with others. But these can be changed. You know why? Conditioning. Human beings are profoundly adaptable creatures and can literally be conditioned to do anything. Maybe thats creepy to you but to me its science and science is a tool we can use to do awesome shit with the time were alive.  Manifest your awesome. That may sound cheesy but figure out what you excel at and do a lot of it. If you are the creative type make some cool stuff. Because what youre doing is externalizing your wonderful self so that when you get those bouts of feeling down on yourself the get fewer and further between the longer you work at building your healthy esteem you can look at all the awesome stuff youve done with your life and honestly it does help to make you feel a little better. You have the rest of your life to live. If you live to be  that means youve got about  years to lead the life of your dreams. How do you want to do that? As a victim to others and circumstance and your own selfimposed prison? Or as with as much equanimity youve been able to muster for yourself because you cared enough about you to invest the time and energy required to heal your self? ,socialskills,cj2laob,1,t5_2r275

1655025,0,t3_2d8mjq,Honestly people might disagree with me on this but when my friends neglect to invite me to something and it hurts my feelings I will usually say something to them. I feel like its better to be honest and straightforward with people most of the time and Id rather do that than sit and stew about it imagining all of the reasons why they dont like me and didnt invite me. Important to note I try to bring it up in a calm and non judgementalangryemotional way. I usually go about this by saying something like hey this thing that everyone was at I was a little sad that I wasnt invited. Was there any particular reason? And Id say about . of the time it was just an oversight on their part. Especially since Im not always a social butterfly sometimes they just dont think of me because im not in the immediate area or because Ive turned down multiple invites during the previous weeks etc. It has never turned out to be a purposeful noninvite because they didnt want me there. To be clear when I talk about multiple instances of this happening I mean over a long period of time if the same group of friends is consistently not inviting you to anything their might be a bigger issue at hand.To me the purpose of doing this is twofold. For one thing if it happens more than once and I bring it up more than once I start getting invited WAY more often because they realize I want to be included. And secondly hearing the reasons that I wasnt invited and the fact that they have nothing to do with me or my friends interest in me as a person makes me feel a LOT better and I am much less likely to jump to negative conclusions when it happens in the future or with other friend groups.  I have no idea if thats helpful or something that would work for you but it definitely works for me. ,socialskills,cjns2hw,1,t5_2r275

People may respond untrusting if you join scouting out of the blue but just show that you are willing to put effort into it and they will respect you. Not all scoutings are the same yours may suck. Table Tennis. Dont underestimate this sport its quite hard but its at least a sport that wont make you tired. Helping at a pet farm. There is no easier way to get some appreciation than by helping the community. Any other thing you can think of that involves at least one more person!! Ask people. Look at local sites.

2132503,0,t1_claj2w1,Let me start by saying that there is nothing wrong with being introverted and that Im actually an introvert too. There are lots of studies that show that people like us actually feel pain more deeply than other people. This includes social pain of embarrassment or similar types of anxiety. What I did to combat this is constantly fostered a sense of everyone being on my side. If youre like me you know some people who youre not anxious around. I tried to constantly imagine that everyone is like that and wants to get to know me. So I see a cute guy and normally I get super quiet and nervous when talking to him. Im afraid that Ill say something wrong and hell punch me or something. I know its ridiculous and unlikely but my brain does it anyway. If I manage to convince myself that hes friendly just like me its much easier to talk to him. For the most part this is actually true. Most people are happy to talk to a cheerful and respectful person.Theres no cure for being an introvert though.  of people on earth are introverts. Were awesome people. Another way to combat introversion if you wish is to try to avoid blaming yourself for perceived social failures. I dont know if you do this but sometimes Ill mentally berate myself if I think I did or said something stupid. It really kills my willingness to take social risks. So Ive forced myself to be more positive about stuff like that. Instead of getting mad at myself I try to use it as an opportunity to learn a new and better way of interacting with people. Believe it or not the best way to avoid repeating a mistake is to not think about it too much. Notice it understand the situation and then laugh it off. Youre an awesome and interesting guy and no number of silly mistakes is going to change that. Believe this.As to being boring I dont know your particular situation so Im probably not going to give great advice. I heard this but I cant remember where. The best way to be interesting is to be interested. You have to take a real interest in other people and other activities. Like with any change you need to start small. Make a habit of remembering one small piece of information about the people you talk to after each interaction. Just one piece at first. Youll slowly get the hang of paying attention to people and remembering stuff about them. While doing this also bring yourself to care about what goes on in other peoples lives. Ask about family friends hobbies and work. Those are the major four categories of things that are important to people. Apart from that try to find and remember interesting things that you care about. Like maybe a hobby youve always found interesting. This shouldnt be a method of impressing other people it should be something that you care about. It can be a sport or building something or playing a game. Something you can call your own. Passionate interests are interesting to anyone.,socialskills,clavza8,1,t5_2r275

You just know that youve done something that changed your life for the better and it can help society.

Usually any club related to games or animation will have other people that need some practice with their social skills. You also know for a fact you have something in common. This sets the bar lower for conversation and friendship. You can help each other get better at conversation. Try out some of the hobbies your friends like. See if anything sticks. Now you have something else in common. Pay attention to how your friends talk to each other. Keep a journal and add little observations about the mechanics of conversation. What did they say to start a conversation. How did the topic shift while they were talking? etc. Figure out what they find interesting. Do the same thing for people in TV shows within reason. Watch the tv shows your friends are watching and think about what happened during the most recent episode. Where do you think its going to go from here? Why do you think this character did that?

2500940,0,t1_cmimd40,I totally understand and Im pretty similar.  I bascially only like talking about serious stuff.  Man I wish you could just ask people what are you afraid of most in life? or how would you like to change yourself?.  Most people are pretty reticent to talk about this stuff though.  Theyll only talk about it with close friends  and even then only when theyre in the mood.In order to get to the good friend stage you need something less intense to bond over.  If youre an introvert thats going to be an interest of some kind.  Philosophy politics drawing... pretty fringe interests really... its going to be difficult to find people who want to have conversations about this.  Possible though just they might not live near you they will probably be older and they might be a little unusual.  Politics is probably the best bet.  You will def be able to find politicalactivist people your age.  They can be quite fanatical which can be an issue but you cant have everything!You can always pick a new interest which might be more amenable to sharing with other people.  For instance  year ago I took up the guitar.  I had always loved music but I had never tried to play an instrument or even thought about it assuming I had no talent.  But Ive begun to really enjoy it and Ive made quite a few new friends recently by playing music and singing with people.Anyway TLDR as an introvert interestsactivities of whatever sort are a good thing to focus on to make friends.

2660208,0,t3_2qfdpg,I would think that it is due to an anxiety issue perhaps you have become more selfconscious recently? What I found in the past when I first started consciously putting in an effort to make and maintain eye contact is that I couldnt maintain it either it felt awkward and I wondered why. After awhile I realised it was the internal dialogue going on in my mind saying things like Is this weird? Will they feel uncomfortable? etc that made me feel that way. So I knew then I had to make a change in that dialogue. I practiced being present and in the moment with the person Im with by connecting through our eye contact and focusing on the conversation rather than entering into the dialogue in my mind.This is what you can do too to help you maintain eye contact and trust me when I say it is well worth it when you get it because it will give you a deeper sense of connection with the people you are conversing with and your presence will move them and yourself on a deeper level.Learning to take control of your mind to overcome any anxietyinsecurities helps be it through meditation breathing exercises and other focus exercises. Eye contact wise I personally connect left eye to the others left eye and it has helped me. I hope what Ive shared will help you too as it has helped me.,socialskills,cn5tfgm,3,t5_2r275

In the same way a selfproclaimed nice guy can fly off the handle when you point out something they do that makes you uncomfortable. They have an internal image of themselves that they dont want to be proven wrong. Even if it is wrongThe adulterers deadbeats and liars likely had long discussions with long time between them to unravel the emotions of their friends and share their own. They might also live with a serious tear in the relationships mutual trust. You wouldnt see either of those things.I think that people dont want to hold grudges they want to feel whatever they think is good. That could be why they dont care about right or wrong after the emotions have been dealt withThe feelings of people around you are not your responsibilty. They answer to that themselves.Stay cordial to the strangers.

Think about the people you know... the people you want to hang out with are the cool ones right? at least in your eyes. They do cool stuff have interesting ideas and act on them. Now think about the other people you know the ones who just exist they never invite you to stuff or talk to you never seem to have anything going on. You could put forth the effort to get them to hang out with you or talk to you but they wont ever give you anything back they are just responding to you not bringing anything to the table. Thats how people see you. Youre nice and you have similar interests but they want to be social and have cool times in the exact same way that you do. To get more of the people to like you put yourself in their shoes and figure out how you can satisfy that desire for them rather than wishing they would do it for you. Be a doer not a responder.And dont get discouraged if it doesnt work right away. You are shifting a paradigm in their minds. Just be persistent and keep coming up with fun stuff to do and talk about.

Try to think in more factual or constructive terms. Like Im having trouble following the conversation maybe because Im tireddistracteddont know anything about the topic.

By investing time and energy into other people most especially humans who lack the capacity to give back we lighten the burdens of our own hearts and add personal value to these people since we have invested something of ourselves into them.The problem of course is that you dont WANT to help these damn people and that is the wall that our feelings have built between us and others.

At the moment you have some novelty value thats why shes been giving you so much attention but that is going to change very soon.. Make your intentions clear as soon as possible. You want a sexual relationship with this girl so act like it. Otherwise she will assume youre not sexually interested in her and will just think of you as a buddy she can talk to about movies music university etc. Im sure you want more than that.

Once youre too drunk theres a very little chance youll actually impress anyone even though you will think youre doing a great job until the next day when you wake up with cringe worthy memories. Look up some drinking games get others involved. If you can facilitate interaction youll automatically look like a social butterfly. PS if you are going to drink liquor and beer. Try to stick to same types of booze. As in dont do a shot of vodka then a shot of jagger then a shot of whiskey. Mixing alcohol never leads to good results.

She say yes  you beat the odds  she say no  excellent  you are one closer to getting one who will say yes.  Other thing to remember is that attraction is mostly chemical  she either is or she isnt.  It doesnt actually have a lot with you personally.  So if she says no  eh  no biggy  you just dont have the right chemicals that she is looking for.

3346193,0,t1_cp9lf10,That will come with time. Most people statistically arent doing much of anything in terms of relationships before that age. I will say that as a bit of a quiet kid in fact someone who was pretty messed up all through high school I had my first crappy relationship when I was  and my first real relationship when I was . It gets better particularly if you are able to find out what YOU can do that makes OTHER PEOPLE want to be around you. Notice I didnt say what can you do that makes other people like you. I am far from James Bond myself but I have definitely had my moments! One thing that Ive learned is that confidence is really really hard to fake for most people. The best way I can describe it is that confidence is about knowing YOU can do something not about showing other people that you can. There is a road to confidence that involves faking it and this can work but it relies on you convincing other people of your competency. Its a lot better for you in the long run to feel that competency yourself. How do you do that? By becoming an expert in something and being able to discuss it intelligently not just lose yourself in it. I will say that EVERYTHING you are telling yourself sounds familiar but its basically never true. If you say Im overweight or Im X age and no one likes me or I dont know what to do or I dont have social skills  all of these things may be objectively true facts but NONE of them are actually the real problem. The real problem is that YOU dont feel like you can just grab the world with both hands and take what you want from it. Confident people do well in varying degrees of course. The more you can try to truly feel this way the more likely it is that the other pieces will click into place. There was a time a period of about  weeks where I truly felt like the unstoppable motherfucker I wanted to be I was getting laid left and right by several different girls I was incredibly successful at everything I was doing I was learning new things and engaging my mind to the fullest I had my parents huge house all to myself I had enough money to do just about anything I wanted and it was glorious but heres the kicker it happened when I absolutely did not give a FUCK about any of it happening. Literally. I could not care less. And normally I care SO MUCH! About everything! I bet you can relate. At the end of the week period I met a girl the love of my life really who I was with for two years. I say all this not to brag or make you feel in any way inadequate just to illustrate the fact that things change ALL the time. You are just starting out with all this and there is WAY WAY more amazing stuff ahead of you than there is behind you. Who you are today isnt who youre destined to be next year or even next month so dont for a minute think that your current state or current situation has ANYTHING to do with how you can be perceived by others.The best advice I can give you is this James Bond is a psychopath. You can do a lot better by being YOU with all the awesome traits you feel you dont have right now. Try shooting for that first!,socialskills,cp9owc9,4,t5_2r275

3390472,0,t3_2z0mc2,Well if you were truly not stressed then whatever people noticed was not stress but some other behavior which they interpreted as stress.However its very important to recognize that you can be happy and stressed at the same time. So ask yourself if you really were calm or if looking back you only deduce that you were calm because your stress was not accompanied by the usual negative feelings that are associated with it. Going by the other peoples reactions it seems that there is an aspect of your being which you are unaware of but which is showing outwardly. Could it be that there is also an expect of yourself that you are not aware of but that is indeed actually present internally as well? I personally when I was younger went through a period of insane stress without realizing even in the slightest that it was stress which I was feeling. I took a series of panic attacks for me to become conscious of the level of stress I was actually experience every single second of the day. Actual presence of stress and being aware of it are two completely different things. The situation you were in having such responsibility I would actually be surprised if you didnt experience any stress. It only seems natural.Furthermore if people come up to you to offer help and such because you looked stressed the best way to go here is to simply ask them why they think so and what they are noticing about you specifically. This is actually quite important because simply running through all the usual outward signs of stress and trying to correct all or most of them without taking into account your specific person is bound to only create outward behaviors and habits that are even more awkward. You really need other people with feedback for this since they are the ones noticing something about you. Stuff like smiling more even though you dont feel like actually smiling is quite difficult and theres a thin line between nailing it and actually looking more creepy and awkward than simply not smiling and looking stressed for example.Peoples interpretations of your internal feelings in certain situations is what troubles you. So you really need actual feedback from those people in those specific situations. Oh do I look that stressed? Thats funny Im actually feeling quite happy and calm on the inside haha! What made you think I was stressed?  Seems the way to go here.From there you can tackle any specific remarks that came up.,socialskills,cpeqo84,2,t5_2r275

Clubs can be intimidating to visit alone but they are definitely a good place to socialize when youre comfortable with yourself.But like you said op should go to a less crowded pub.  Like you also said op needs to start small.OP if you arent comfortable and confident with yourself Im afraid you wont do well on your own.  Building confidence seems like a daunting task but its not impossible. I suggest you work on yourself. You can do this by taking care of your appearance and hygiene. Those two things can do wonders for your self esteem.  Exercise and enriching yourself with knowledge and experiences will also help.I used to try to go out alone but I always found myself walking around at night while trying to muster the courage to visit a bar. I rarely did have the courage to enter a bar club pub etc so I looked like a creep.

Flash cards are a way of doing thisFind a flash card way of working on social skills.  Interact with people  minutes a day and maybe once a week have a prolonged event you can socialize inWhen youre working on social skills like smiling and making eye contact youre actively making mistakes and learning from them.  If you go  days without practicing youll forget the mistakes you learn and will have to relearn them when you start socializing againBut when you do a little practice every single day the mistakes that you did the previous days are fresh in your mind so you dont have to redo the mistake to learn itAnd when you dont have to waste time relearning mistakes you ingrain in yourself how to do it right and youll also have the opportunity to make new different mistakes and the process starts all over with thoseHopefully in my own way I answered those  questions.

Based on what you have told us there is no solution that will let you continue with both relationships and have them be mature loving and healthy. Pick one. End the other. Tell the person that you did not pick that you are ending your relationship to her. Let her know that you are sorry and that it hurts you too. Dont be a stranger dont be a dick.

Once you find out a common link between you two even something as small as the fact that both of you have an upcoming test use that to create a oneonone bonding session. Examples Both of you have a test coming up. You need someone to study with. Study with them. Its a highstress environment but when you procrastinate together and lose yourself in short bursts of productivity it somehow creates a bond. Especially if you both have an introverted side. You are together during this stressful time and you become closer. Go to lunch or dinner with them. Oneonone. You have to fill the void with talking. And it becomes deeper as you both become more comfortable with each other. Honestly drunk moments are also great. After a party or a night out coming home and just sitting and talking while both drunk is an intense bonding time. Especially if youre both up late when you usually arent. You can freely be more honest with each other and hopefully youll remember it. If youve known these people for years its actually easier for each of these situations to arise. You may not feel comfortable but to the other person asking them to lunch or to hang out after a party is actually quite fluid because youve known each other for so long. What will happen is you will both bond and you will realize that you both should have done this sooner. Then BOOM bffs,socialskills,cqjc9co,8,t5_2r275

Its encouraging to know you have one friend that seems like he is a constant in your life!However I feel as though you saying so much in your post that you dont fit in or dont want to do certain things is probably noticed by others. Perhaps you have a social anxiety and I think people probably see it as you being extremely uncomfortable with them or their friends or what they are doing. Which can be totally common. I would consider myself very social but in some instances I can be very socially uncomfortable and I feel like the room can feel it when I am uncomfortable or not wanting to be somewhere. I may think that I am hiding it well but my body language is probably more obvious then I think.Perhaps you could join a sports league team to meet friends I am on a volleyball team and on our down time we go out to eat and drink and go hiking and have potlucks.

In reality you can do and say what you want within the law and if people dont like what you say then they arent the people you want to make friends with. And what status you have? People with many friends dont think like that in fact I dont think many people do. Who honestly cares? If youre lighthearted up for having fun andor useful to others. I take it a step further and reframe it so that if YOU think people are lighthearted funny cool and are useful then they can hang out with you but you need to provide value to do this. Worrying about when to say hello means you really need to get out there and start conversations with practically everyone  say hello to everyone you pass on the sidewalk the checkout guygirl make an observation on something at work or whatever.

The idea is you separate yourself by showing you treat her as a relative equal but you dont insult when you neg. These are unfortunately women who need to already be defensive and potentially mean to people not because they want to be that way but because its the quickest way to stop all these guys from hitting on them. Its just meant as an ice breaker then you just act normally. For any other woman youre just being a complete jerk and it doesnt work. DO NOT treat negging as insulting.

5724141,0,t3_3tj0z1,You might just be in the wrong place to be honest. Small towns are more closeknit than cities and such. If you dont know people there it gets harder to join in with and all of the people there are already friends and hence if one of them forms a bad opinion of you they all will form that eventually. You never know what people think of you and unfortunately sometimes confidence can also be seen as cockiness. There might be other things and factors contributing to their disdain for you such as jealousy ultimately were all looking out for ourselves and that can lead to uncalled for disliking of things. But that doesnt really matter. All that matters is that you remain true to yourself and dont take their opinions too hard.As for what you should do ... in all honesty move. Youre a  year old if youre stuck in a quiet lonely town then get out of it. Move to a city someplace where there is a night life. Where you can meet more people. Where the people that you meet are more diverse. Now I know there are more technicalities to moving than just picking up your stuff an going but work towards it. Save some money every month to afford the move. Look into where you want to go maybe visit a city nearby and see if you like the atmosphere? Explore evaluate plan save up and proceed. Youll eventually get there.And in the meantime just be yourself in the workplace maybe try and figure out what they dislike but overall just keep doing what youre doing. If you have spare time fix that weight issue. I know its not that easy but give it a shot. Itll keep you busy and give you something extra to do in the day not to mention make you feel oh so much better about yourself. Go to gym and start monitoring what you eat. And eventually youll get there.Im currently busy with all of this. In  months I move to the city of my dreams and in the last  months Ive lost around  kgs. Just stay positive stay busy.

I have a loudmouth extrovert friend who did all the leading stuff but there were a problem with tables in the caf we tried to get in. So while he stood there confusedly I stepped up nearly gave orders to my group pulled it off real good. Felt good. The key is in trying. Contrarily we had a lab class this week we had to figure something out as a class. I stepped up gave the right answer to the folks yet they chose not listen to me and professor pitied us and gave the answers. I was right though lol.

Once you head back either your old friends will get over it or itll be an opportunity to start some new friendshipsAs far as your specific situation its seem like they think you are jealous of their relationship andor in love with the girl and not just as a friend. Im making that assumption since you described her as hotIf this is TRUE Id give them some space. Youll see them anyway during school and be friendly but otherwise leave them alone and take some time for your feelings to subsideIf this is UNTRUE Id approach the guy and apologize for teasing them. Support him in wanting to be with the girl. If he feels hes got nothing to worry about then the friendship will start to healIn either case Chat with other people during class and try to find people with common interests. Look into joining a club or after school activity. Check out  High school sucks for most people but it does provide a lot of opportunities to make new friends much more than later in life.

They were a nice couple and they responded positively we had a long conversation. Turned out we had lots in common with the girl making everything flow easily. Id occasionally sit back in my seat let them do their talking. It was instinctual but its good to not seem pushy. I just did what felt right and natural.

I think you have negative feelings around these thoughts of your friends having fun without you because you feel like theres a shortage of friends to be had. Try to see an abundance of friends just waiting to meet you. Its the truth everyone  EVERYONE likes friends and would like more unless they have so many that their phone is ringing off the hook.

Made the mistake of going to college in the same city I live in while everyone else came from out of town and was staying in campus. Obviously everyone else bonded in campus because they were all basically living together but I was stuck living with my parents for the first  years of college so everyone formed their little groups and I got left out. I only made ONE real friend in all of college. Shit.Tried meetups gym and online dating as means to meet new people to talk to and make friends with but it always feels forced. I always have to carry the conversation and I never get reciprocated interest. Its like Im trying to get to know people but they dont want to get to know me because they already have their close friends and dont really want to let me in. Gotta still keep trying though there really is no other choice. Its either that or Ill slowly lose my mind sitting in my apartment alone day after day and Ill kill myself one day. I really dont want that to be my future or anyone elses for that matter. Theres gotta be some people left in my city willing to hang out with me.

This could be  things She said it but just as teasing chitchat or she said it with sincerity and you dont feel the connection. If its the former then dont even worry about it. It meant nothing to her and shouldnt mean anything to you. If you felt like being honest Just tease back. Maybe instead of a blantant no a respectful and playful sarcastic comment could be a better option since her teasing already shows she has humor.If its the latter Perhaps you felt it was innappropiate for your level of relationship i.e. coworkers. If you dont feel comfortable with it give off the subtle sign of awkwardness. Although many of us avoid awkwardness its used to softly say thats innapropiate. Dont be the nice guy but dont be the bad guy either. Just nod it off and shell hopefully get the message.If she doesnt get the message and you truly feel the latter gradually make your message clearer over time if it makes you uncomfortable.In any sort of day to day situation like this always ask yourself first Am I comfortable with this?

I just dont know what it is...On some days I can socialize like its nobodys business.  Other days I feel so awkward and useless and most interactions are weird and inconsistent.Im getting over being depressed and some of the awkward habits that I gained during that period definitely affect how people treat me.A couple things Ive noticed so far is that I dont always make eye contact when appropriate and I sometimes speak softlymumble.  Its probably from that year where I lost a bunch of friends gained a lot of weight and people stopped respectinglistening to me.Still I cant seem to attract friends like I used to.  Unless they are very patient people who think my quirks are funny or they dont mind them.One thing I did a little while ago was film myself doing normal things.  I filmed myself eating breakfast and saw that I was slouching appeared sad and jittery.  I hated seeing myself like that but it was definitely a wakeup call.  Im trying to change but on the inside I am sad.  And that has been holding me back for a looong time now.  The people Im around now have NO CLUE about my past and dont seem to care which is fine and expected but sometimes I just wish I could tell them about the last  years of my life so they could have some perspective other than labeling me as an awkward person who was born this way.I hope we both find help just know youre not the only one who feels this way.,socialskills,d0kegwt,1,t5_2r275

6900386,0,t1_d0xh5wc,This is very true. There is something very important about drinking relationships that I dont think most people notice. Drinking represses emotional learning because it is so disinhibiting. All of the social stresses and emotionally motivated responses that cause people to be shy difficult and anxious in sober life are removed when people are drinking and while that temporarily leads to a smoother transaction in the long run it means that the social situation never really adds to your repertoire of social skills. Recovering alcoholics talk about learning how to have emotions all over again they become mushed together and difficult to understand because their emotional memory has become so foggy over a long period of time.This is why I no longer drink. I now encourage the anxiety and fears that I used to run away from in social situations because I know thats where the learning occurs.,socialskills,d0yh6zp,1,t5_2r275

7044548,0,t3_4c2kcz,Just do it and youll learn.I used to suffer from social anxiety still do up to a point and I would have never imagined myself going to a club alone. Its just weird scary and awkward. But now? I actually prefer to go out alone. Heck the majority of time I go clubbing I go alone. When you go to a club with a group of friends you are constantly together. Constant check ups on each other going to the bar together dancing together smoking together. You are limiting your freedom. But alone? Do whatever you want. Want to socialize? Well tough luck  since your friends arent there to talk to you now need to socialize with strangers! How did I get to this point? Well I started moving around. A LOT. Not just different cities  different countries! Luckily for me I am very passionate about Techno and I go to clubs more for getting to know the local scene and listen to music than make friends.So I am new in town. No friends. Nothing. I get the sudden urge to listen to some music and dance. First time going out alone was scary I wont lie. I didnt know what to expect. I thought I will be alone the entire night and then leave after I am done. The first hour or so was awkward but once the alcohol kicked in I started enjoying myself. Thats the most important thing  you have to be enjoying your own company. If you are going to be standing in a corner and stare at people like a creep people will avoid you like the plague.Smoking helps. Sweaty tired craving for some cancer in your lungs? Go outside. Too shy to talk to people? Approach someone and ask for a lighter. Cant even manage to do that? Dont worry later at night people will come to you asking for cigarettes. At the bar? Talk to people around you. Talk to the bartender. Make jokes. Work on your banter skills.  A club is a social environment. It doesnt matter if you are introverted or extroverted  everyone wants to meet people and talk. At first glance it might not seem to be the case but thats because the majority of people are shy. This is a huge eye opener for me.,socialskills,d1euva7,7,t5_2r275

7063162,0,t1_d1gtzkv,I see what you are saying Raey but I wholeheartedly disagree. Cold approaches do not have to be creepy. There is absolutely nothing wrong with one human being going up to another complete random human being and introducing themselves. OP doesnt have to make his assuming OP is a guy first initial impression to a girl that he wants to bang her. That would indeed be creepy. OP could be much more tactful than that. He could easily go up to any random girl and introduce himself and strike up a conversation. People do this all the time and it is by no means a creepy thing to do. If she is legit annoyed that a guy wanted to introduce himself in a friendly way then I dont think shes worth the time anyways. To OP I dont think the first words out of your mouth should be I think youre cute. Although if that works for you then go for it! I think by just simply going up to a girl and introducing yourself you will have already said enough to express that you have interest in her. To top it off an easy conversation piece could be to compliment her outfit. You could ask where she got her outfit from. Then when youre ready tell her it was a pleasure to meet her and that you look forward to talking again. If you are bold enough ask for a number. This doesnt have to be creepy at all. Dont be hurt if shes not interested though. If you tried and shes not interested thats totally fine. Just be happy you put yourself out there and move on  ,socialskills,d1gyyab,3,t5_2r275

Practice opening up girls in a more interested manner. For example if you meet a cute girl anywhere go up to her and say something like.I just noticed you walking by and thought id come by to say youre really cute would you like to go out sometime?Its very blunt and full of confidence youll get rejected a lot but its a way to learn how to act and react when being more direct with girls.

That involves girls too. Another thing to do that Ive recently experimented with is when needing information that anyone in a large group of people could have I ask the groups of girls first and just be nice and gentlemen like. For example I went to a concert that I knew weed was going to be openly smoked at so since I had none myself I asked all the groups of girls first if they smoked and had any.

7460281,0,t1_d2pvtcl,Im the guy giving you advice youd rather spurn via personal attacks than even consider because its too real too harsh and involves a lot of uncomfortable challenges to the way your conception of the world works which at  really should have had some cold water splashed on it by now. Even if you dont agree the fact that you default to combing my profile rather than sit with an unpleasant feeling in your belly speaks volumes about where your development as a person is regardless of how nice you seem. That kindof attitude is that of a child convinced hes a professional because he knows how to do th grade level research and I sure as hell wouldnt want to hang out with that. And its not because youre wrong about me or that I feel personally attacked. Youre not exactly right about me but yeah I dont have a wide social life. Like most people mine died down around  once everyone in my sphere got jobs moved away and most of my connections moved to online relationships and casual acquaintances.The problem is you want to conflate the source for the wisdom because you think I wouldnt trust a doctor to give me car advice is not only transitive but also reflexively true. Im sharing what I know based on both personal experience and the research of other peoplefriends family and third party authors alike. And even then its only a foolish arrogant child who isnt willing to take an opinionhowever contentious to themand at least consider it before outright dismissal. Your dismissal is predicated on the assumption that being nice is the same thing as being deserving and that having girlfriends is some sortof barometer for your ability to have friends. Its not. You can make friends through your girlfriend though and theyll pretty much have to put up with you if they want to be friends with her so you can always try that. Thats how my grandfather made friends. Which is the big reason why youve begun to irritate me. Itd be one thing if you offered any sortof substantive argumentative challenge to this but you havent. Youve gone right to the I dont know if I should trust some loser bit because thats easier and more comfortable than consider what I have to say. No wonder you dont have any friends if this is how you treat someone willing to take time out of their day to try and help you. You act like you need to be picked up and then complain when you dont get a bowl of warm milk and a trophy for letting someone else help you. Ive given you what I know and what I integrate into my own life that has served me rather well and far more than youve proven you deserve.

Its basically using your emotions to get your way sometimes even at the others expense. You want to be spontaneous when talking with others especially when apologizing. Spontaneous communication is honest and open. When you are spontaneous vs. strategic manipulative then you will notice that you can truly express your emotions and become constructive dealing w conflict instead of avoiding it using fake emotions. ,socialskills,d3dauao,6,t5_2r275

7808841,0,t3_4m7dy8,I come from poverty abuse broken home am an alcoholic etc so my self esteem sucks. But around when I was  I got a job at the mall and cleaned up a little and realized Im a pretty attractive guy. Then I fucked up my life for a decade getting fucked up all the time and generally not caring...I finally got sober and lived in a halfway house for a year and a half while I saved up money to get back in school get a car and get my own place. Finally pulled it off and one of my first nights out with a good friend was this costume party at a local bar I dont drink but I smoke weed and like going out. Immediately on walking in literally THE hottest girl in the bar was working there at the door starts flirting with me we flirt back and forth for a while turns out shes a little younger than me but goddamn she is so fucking fine. So I get her number then a few days later I text her while Im at the gym and she really really wants to hang out. I even told her I had homework and couldnt hang and she was like lemme just come over and keep you company...Bear in mind at this point in my life I just moved out of a halfway house at one point I was homeless and had to stay in a shelter so Im not used to fine ass girls being into me. So my first reaction is she wants to hustle me for a place to crash or steal from me so Im skeptical but I agree because once again she is so so fine. She comes over we sit at my kitchen table and smoke some weed I get chatty when I smoke so we end up talking like girlfriends for like an hour. Then comes Netflix and chill scary movie on the couch I mean everything was laid out on a silver platter but I was so high and Im so prone to anxiety I didnt make a move. It was literal Netflix and just chill. She leaves I blew it the next day Im out frolfing with my buddy and I text something stupid like Do you like frisbee golf? and she just LOLs back like Im the biggest dork because I am.Last year this happened  other times with super fine girls from school all obviously totally into me and me being an awkward doofus that cant manage to just say what I want so I beat around the bush and make small talk. Im pretty good at small talk and cracking jokes and making a girl laugh but for some reason I just cant shake my issues from the past so its always surprising and weird to me when it actually works and a hot girl is into me no matter how many times it happens.tldr  Im probably above average in looks but definitely below average in confidenceselfesteem when it comes to dating.EDIT Also want to follow that up by saying my confidence has actually grown quite a bit but more in the fact that Im okay with just being me and kind of being a loner.

7815551,0,t3_4mc4sv,Honestly Ive found that being obvious yet subtle when it comes to these interactions only works sometimes. In my experience the best way is to be brief and straightforward.You can try going through your boss first. This man makes me uncomfortable. And next time either have your boss tell the man to leave or ask if you can have permission to politely but succinctly tell him to leave or stop talking to you.If it helps try to get into a business mindset. He comes in doesnt buy anything and hasslesdistracts an employee. You telling him to leave is just business. You dont need to justify anything either. Its not like he can call the cops on you. Businesses have the right to refuse service.I wouldnt even give him the opportunity to buy something. Because I wouldnt want him to come back.But if telling him hes not welcome is too difficult then just say Sorry but I dont want to talk to you. Fullstop. Again no justification necessary and ignore him. Ignore provocative statements everything. If things escalate call your boss or police if things really escalate. Remember you have the right to refuse service. Just talk to your boss beforehand. Ive worked in the restaurantservice industry so I know how it can be. Weve had a lot of entitled people come in and try to get too personal. One person even tried to force their religion on another employee and threw a tantrum when they were called out. But he never came back. Keep it professional but be straightforward. People will usually be too embarrassed to continue being assholes for long.edit,socialskills,d3uj66k,1,t5_2r275

Some people interrupt others because any minor break they take while speaking is seen as a turn to switch speakers  when the other person wasnt finished and didnt think they communicated it clearly.So end results are frustrations on both ends. The person who gets talked over and is not allowed to finish their sentence will be frustrated and can try to remediate on next talk attempts by talking with more volume a lot faster and not leaving any kind of pauses until done. And the interruptors will probably perceive the people they keep talking over as nonassertive and indecisive or too silent.,socialskills,d5yey91,1,t5_2r275

This was the first time shes seen me outside of me heading to work or leaving work so I had it down. My workplace is also on the opposite side of town about a twentyminute drive so I was a little surprised to see her so close to my home. People are generally very weird to me. I either get women my own age who all seem to act socially awkward whenever I talk to them or I have middleaged women approach me out of nowhere and just start talking to me like were best friends. Theres this one customer I have at work and she started complimenting me emphatically whenever I would serve her. If she got served by a coworker of mine instead? She would just start talking about me the entire time to them. Eventually coworkers that I didnt know very well were approaching me asking if I knew this customer because theyre always talking about me to them. I started to see this lady everywhere out of work too coincidence right?. She even joked and said that she wasnt stalking me but its pretty awkward when youre in a Subway being served and this middleaged lady is making a fuss and apologising to you and promising that she isnt stalking...She saw me at a cafe once and came over to my table to introduce me to her yearold son. And I was really confused how their relationship could function when she was complimenting a strangers appearance constantly in front of her own son. Now she tries to offer me rides home from work and Im not so sure thats a good idea. But it seems to be a pattern. Im not threatened for my life or anything but people tend to be concerned for me because Im never concerned when I should be.

I got intrusive personal question all the time and had to perfect the art of extracting myself from conversations. Its a difficult situation and some times it just cant be done no matter what. But I found the following to be a good outline that works a respectable amount of time.To start answer their question with a question. A huge number of people just hold conversation on autopilot. This trick lets you avoid answering anything personal and they may not even notice you are avoiding the question.If that does not work its time to fire a warning shot. Answer the question with a question. But this time make your own question be about their purpose. Why do you ask? or Whats the purpose of that question? are good here. Also do not ask it as a question with the pitch going up at the end. Say it like a statement with the pitch staying even.If that still is not working it is time to pull out the big guns. Its sort of hard to explain using just text on a screen but its something I have seen called a cold halt. Its single word said very short and clipped at the end. Seriously!? or Really!? work here. Said very forceful. Nearly barked. And with NO FOLLOW UP. The most important part of a cold halt is the lingering silence at the end.As I said this is not a foolproof plan and sometimes no matter what you do nothing works.

8822099,0,t1_d789hiw,I really believe that you cant truly fall in love with someone unless you love yourself and in order to love yourself you need to know who you are first. Even the ancient Greeks knew and practiced this idea. When people fall in love without fully knowing themselves often what they are falling in love with is an idea an illustration of that person combined with their desires and insecurities. The idea can change in one direction or stays the same while the actual person changes in another and over time the love disappears because it was never truly aware of the situation to begin with. I have trouble falling in love with the right people as well but I also know that no amount of seeking is going to find it if I dont become comfortable loving myself on my own terms first.CBT is cognitive behavioural therapy. The main idea is that our thoughts are connected to our behaviors and our behaviors to our emotions and our emotions to our thoughts and that these three all cause and are caused by each other so they are basically one in the same. Observing the cycle of blame and reaction and assumption helps us to understand why we think and act the way we do and helps us make better decisions as well as identifying unskillful or harmful thoughts and behaviors. Mindfulness and CBT are what most modern psychologists study about when they are learning to be therapists.,socialskills,d78amof,5,t5_2r275

You cant allow yourself to think about what might happen. You will never know what is possible if you dont make the first move.  Saying this is a lot easier than acting when you are struggling with social anxiety. I struggled with this for years! The only way to beat this is to live in the moment and get out of your own thoughts. Look into each of her eyes then her lips put your hand on the side of her head and just go for it. If she reciprocates then youve got this.  From there tell her how you feeldont confess your love but with subtle confidence and everything will feel natural after that.  ,socialskills,d7haofg,1,t5_2r275

If shes making a lot of eye contact grooming herself fixing her hair etc smiling at you a lot laughing at your jokes... these are all signs that shed be open to go on a date.ampnbspDefinitely talk one on one for a while before asking her out. Theres no set number of minutes it depends entirely on how shes reacting. Wait for the conversation to break naturally or see if you can bring up a movie or event youd like to take her to in conversation so the asking part is less awkward. If shes busy try for another day. If shes busy again shes saying no unless she specifies otherwise.ampnbspStarting conversations is tricky there are a million ways to do it. If you go out with groups just wait until you can start a side conversation. Basically it boils down to just having fun and talking to girls like theyre just humans like you are.

9418159,0,t3_59n775,Sorry but this is not a good article at all. At the beginning the concept of flow is introduced with an explanation thats far too rudimentary. After reading your article its not clear what conversational flow actually looks like. You also reference it at the end but dont mention it at all in between. You dont point out how your tips are supposed to get someone into a flowlike state.  Flow is such an interesting topic and you could have done so much more with it! I mean I know the guy who came up with the concept has an unpronouncable name but you could at least reference him or recommend his books.  Although you said that theres not one correct way to hold a conversation that seems to be exactly what your advice points at. People who talk a lot need to talk less. People who dont talk enough need to read more so they can talk more. People who debate need to be more pleasant. All the advice points into the empty middle of pleasant mellowness  completely neglecting that having your own style might be the most important aspect of being a great conversationalist. The actual advice given isnt helpful either. For example you assume that everyone who talks a lot talks too much. On the other hand some people are great entertainers and that requires being in the middle of everyones attention and talking a lot. Besides assuming that someone who doesnt know what to say lacks general knowledge is pretty insulting isnt it? Isnt it far more likely that such a person is afraid of saying the wrong thing? Take a short glimpse through this subreddit and youll find that to be the case. Amassing more knowledge does absolutely nothing in this situation. Similar things can be said about the other conversationalist types. Speaking of which these arent conversationalist types. They are dysfunctional styles of conversation. What about the plethora of great personal functional styles that are far more engaging and exciting than the mellow neutrality you seem to recommend?  What about people who dont talk much but are excellent at asking the right questions and guiding the conversation? Two of my closest friends are like that and although theyd fall into the thinker and thus boring category according to your nomenclature they are anything but that. Or the entertainer that I just mentioned? Or someone whos engaging because they know a lot and can entertain people with facts? Not everyone with a broad general knowledge is a socially inept knowitall.,socialskills,d99tf11,1,t5_2r275

Theres nothing wrong with making friends or friends at work.  I do think it is dangerous to set the expectations of a relationship before it develops however.You should first and foremost see it as a causal working relationship.  Be nice to your coworkers because thats the cool thing to do.  It helps keep the company culture positive.Also you mention mistakes... The only real mistake youre making here is thinking too much about yourself.  Your social mishaps your intent on making this a real friendship whether or not you come off as clingy.  No offense but from another persons point of view you can think of this as being kind of selfish.  After all your coworker probably has no idea that this is such a meaningful matter to you and just shows up to work like everyone else does.Sometimes people have good days people have bad days.  If a coworker brought me out to lunch Id be like cool... these arent bad folks might let me get a feel for what the culture and personality types are here.But at that point I dont even know if I want to make any friends at this place or not.  I dont know if Im going to want to keep working here.  I dont know if Ill just want to do my work and go home or eventually invite these people to see my family and go on trips together.And you dont know that either so you shouldnt try to project so far in the future when it comes to your own feelings.Evaluate how people are doing in the present and respond accordingly.  Thats really all you can do.Thats for your own benefit too.  Without really getting to know someone you dont know if you like them at all or not so any preconceptions you have about them or the kind of relationship you may have is all speculation on your part.  Not a good thing!Just stay aware and in the moment.  Dont worry about it too much.  Respect your coworkers space and back off just a tad.  Not everyone wants serious friendships at the workplace.EDIT  By the way I saw that inviting someone out first is a big step forward to you.  Youre doing fine!  Just calm down and slow down a bit   Its OK.  These things take time.  And theres too much uncertainty in the dynamics of interpersonal relationship for you to be too invested in something you dont know how it will turn out or how people will turn out.,socialskills,d9p61l7,1,t5_2r275

9725578,0,t3_5eea3o,Adam dont be so hard on yourself. Theres a lot of people JUST LIKE YOU!!! Generally speaking people dont have tons of girl friends and lots of sexual encounters. From my general experience and based on the people that I know. Generally people have less than  sexual encounters and have been in less relationships throughout their lives. Usually what happens is people find someone and then spend the majority of their time with that person for the rest of their life. Another thing is people who like to drink and party generally have more sexual experiences because the alcohol makes it easier to approach women and it makes it easier for you to do things youll regret later. But if thats not you DONT DO IT! Theres ways you can improve and get better. Look into day game and pickup artist. If you can get good at it then you can realize that its just a numbers game.

NOW that streams have merged you can work your way down the smaller streams in natural conversation.its just like you said people are diverse and its that very reason having a popular interest or hobby is such good opening material.being yourself works for people who know who they are. if you have to paddle your own canoe you need to first learn which one is yours.,socialskills,dard3ev,26,t5_2r275

Or find a hobby that involves other people and join a local group that does said hobby. Dont sit around in your underwear.It sounds like the older friends youve made are just not good friends.

If you fail again just write down new questions which came up and better the answers which didnt go so well. The more interviews you do the better youll get and the more likely youll succeed. Also the last part is crap as its just what they do in many cases. The best I could suggest is to check up yourself if you dont hear back.

10280595,0,t3_5n6i5g,I have this problem as well but I find a sort of good solution to it is thisStart creating new experiences with this person. Heres what I meanYouve already established to this person through a great first impression that youve got a lot in common and generally a cool dude. So what do friends do with each other? They hang out and have fun aka creating experiences and a history together.What I personally like to do is to play video gamesboard games with people that I have already established a connection with. Coop games are great for getting two people to have fun and it forces them to work together as a team to win at a shared goal. By playing videoboard games with your new friend you spend hours and days and even weeks together to beat a game. Then find a new game you both want to play and do it again.This was how I found my current best friend. She and I played hours of minecraft while we were living  hours away from each other and when she was looking for a place to live I invited her to become my roommate.If you want to create a shared bonding experience in real life I suggest finding someone who wants to do what you want to do. For example I enjoy eating at delicious restaurants and then chilling at a cafe sipping on a tasty drink. Me my best friend and our new friend did this together and we had a great time. So I will repeat this again for new friends. Make great first impression. After a great talk really know you and the other persons shared interests . Go after this shared interest and do this hobby together with them. Have fun and if you gel well together spend hours together!. Profit,socialskills,dc9d18s,50,t5_2r275

Sometimes youve got people with anxiety for example and it causes them to not shut up more times than not though the person is an egomaniac and attention whore. Just shut them down ask to get a word in and if theyre really that bad just ignore them wall away or join another conversation.

10731707,0,t1_ddmoab1,Thanks for the awesome reply .I just messaged her again so hopefully I can hold a good conversation with her. I think I do lack confidence like you mentioned going to the gym has helped with that some. Sometimes I look at myself in their walls of mirrors and I am happy with what I see. So hopefully I can stop being so negative with myself soon.One of the things that intimidates me the most about her is the fact that her dad is an nfl coach. I am lucky enough to live in a pretty privileged area but her family is way above my family in that sense. I feel like itd be hard to impress her when she has been so privileged. Her house is over  Million o she spends so much time around these massive football players the tuition of the private school she goes to is more than the college I am likely going to attend. I dont think that she is the kind of person who would care about those kinds of things but it just feels kind of intimidating to me.I really would like to ask her to hang out but I dont feel confident I would be able to talk to her. In my mind I really do hold her as being so far above me I dont know if Id ever be able to comfortably just hang out with her. Like my dad has season tickets to the games and when Id go and just seeing her on the sidelines would make me feel nervous. I really probably should just move on but my brain wont let me. Its not even the fear of being rejected okay maybe a little bit it is that but its just being so nervous to even talk to her.Thanks again for the response.,socialskills,ddmw8qi,2,t5_2r275

Every morning no matter how bad you feel start with one push up then add another when you can. Then a walk. Start with just around the block. When you can walk around the block walk two...when you can walk ten start fast walking them then jogging then running.Check if your college has a free counselling program for students. Use every resource you can. I did a lot of my early work with a twelve step program called adult children of alcoholics. Food. Change your diet. You are exhausted but make sure you eat at least one healthy meal a day. Eliminate alcohol and sugar. Work towards only  eating foods with single ingredients. Like tomatoes instead of sugar laden sauces.And volunteer. You feel like shit but the guys at the local soup kitchen will value you far more than you value yourself just for showing up and chopping vegetables. Or the animal shelter. Or wherever Look at the people you are around. If there are people who put you down or treat you with disrespect including your family cut them loose have nothing to do with them.Depression is an illness. An illness that is entirely treatable but unfortunately in our culture there is not a lot of respect for that illness. But you going full berserker you can prove those motherfuckers wrong.

And once you can see your pattern.  Once you can objectify it.  Once you can pull it outside of you place on the floor in front of you walk around it and observe it like an object from different angles...It loses its power over you.The problem is that you are caught inside of a game right now the cycle.And the first rule of any game is to know that you are in one.And once you can see the game that you are in...you can chose to play the game or leave the game.A couple of questions that I want you to really consider.  Read them slowly and fully consider them.You mentioned that you like to comfort or be happy with someone but it feels weak.IF that is how your life was like up until now...What wont happen if you dont change?Read it again slowly.What wont happen if you dont change?What wont happen if you dont learn to connect with others?How wont you be as a person having not become strong enough to accept weakness when you accept it?Because youre open...to learning those new knew things you know you need to learn...because when you step into something newknew...newknew things will automatically show upWill they not?Read up on the triangle so you can see the personality cycle that you are stuck in.You can get a better idea of this cycle by checking out the enneogram personality typing system.

You keep asking them questions they give short responses and the conversation quickly turns into an uncomfortable interview.

The only rule I would follow is to never invite someone twice to the same event. If youre going to play Xbox after school and you want to invite an acquaintance go for it. If they says no dont ask later in the day to do the same thing. But you can as again the following week with no harm. Just as an example when I was in high school it would have looked something like this Hey man do you play Mario Kart? If they say yes Well Ive got another controller  at my house if you want to play later today text me after school ends  this takes pressure off them responding immediately since they could just text you that their busy if they dont want to and also its super casual  youre doing the event whether they come or not. If they say no just say ahh too bad.. and then let them engage you if their interested and if they dont engage just say something like well if you ever want to learn hit me up.. Remember you can always back out of any conversation that is getting awkward or making you uncomfortable by just saying Hey man I dont mean to interrupt here but I gotta use the restroom real quick.

11508458,1,t1_dg0bd7n,Yeah this sort of sounds like he represses the social side of himself. Mostly all humans are naturally social whether they can express this desire is up to them. I for one can say that spending too much time on the Internet gives you the illusion of having friends. Also hearing about peoples lives def isnt boring.,socialskills,dg0hh8v,1,t5_2r275

11527114,0,t1_dg2kxzz,Yea Ive been there. Easiest thing to do is to not talk so much. Even when you know a lot about a topic. Your knowledge is for you. You dont want to be the actually guy. You know the guy that injects himself into every conversation by saying actually then proceeds to tell people why theyre wrong. Basically stop showing off so much. Be honest with yourself. I bet youll find the places where youre doing it. ,socialskills,dg2lm6a,13,t5_2r275
11529087,1,t1_dg2qns4,Thank you. This is actually great advice and it makes a lot of sense. The guy may be oversensitive and then he could speak negatively of me to other potential sources of fruitful amp entertaining social interaction and making me lose possibilities. If I tell him I wasnt feeling it I place more of the blame on myself which is inaccurate but much more honest then inventing an event that makes me busy. This is a really great post and it explains why I shouldnt be more direct and provides the solution to the problem. If I had the money I would give you gold but unfortunately I dont so I hope my sincere gratitude is enough. ,socialskills,dg2to9s,-2,t5_2r275

11568079,0,t3_653qac,So youve already arranged to meet up but you havent sorted out the details?If it was me Id make a couple of suggestions while leaving it open for her to make suggestions too. I thought we could go see a movie than get something to eat what do you think?. If she doesnt like that idea shell recommend something and youll sort it out from there.As shes someone you already know I guess the first thing Id ask is the broad so what have you been up to? question. That opens up all kinds of potential avenues of discussion.,socialskills,dg78wsl,1,t5_2r275
11581504,0,t3_6598ha,Girls are just as human as you are.  Just be a decent person.  The type of stuff that gets put on rniceguys and rcreepyPMs are situations where a guy sees a woman or women in general as a means to an end.  The end being their own sexual or emotional gratification.  If you dont have much experience interacting with women just be friendly and polite.  Talking to women is a little different but its not black and white and its something that just takes experience.    In my experience women tend towards conversation with more context than what men talk about.  That is in casual workschoolacquaintance types of situations men seem more ready to discuss the ins and outs of a video game sport work or other topic of interest.  Women seem more ready to discuss their daily life their relationships. If your intent is romance you should make it clear but not so much as to seem like thats the only reason you even began speaking with her.  If youre not a bold person such as myself you can drop hints and sort of steer the conversation to a point where you might be able to just tell her how you feel as opposed to just saying Hey I think youre cute want to go out some time?.  If youre not good at steering conversations it becomes a game of fishing but if you wait too long before showing any kind of romantic interest then youll miss the boat.  However you kind of need to gauge her interest at the same time.  Women get approached more than men do so if shes seeking you out as someone to talk to then thats a good sign.  If shes responding to your messagescallsconversation promptly and with some enthusiasm then thats a good sign and you should try to find out what her deal is.  Saying stuff like I love you I think youre beautiful I blah blah blah out of nowhere is not going to go over well.  Source Im shy but manage to do okay dating.  Also most of my coworkers and friends are female.,socialskills,dg8rqnn,13,t5_2r275
11589040,0,t1_dg9m0k1,Hey OP! Youre very welcome. I do still respond to strangers since I still want to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and hope that theyre good people. You are absolutely right that a follow up would not be forcing the conversation forward! You could prepare a follow up thats about a common interest. Do you like cooking or something like that? You could ask for a recipe you wanted to try out. Or come up with an example of how she inspired you to show genuine inspiration though it should be something concrete and consistent. For example if she inspired you to start exercising or change your exercise routine you can say when you started how youre still at it and whats improved. Developing common ground is the goal of the next message. You can also let her thanks rock in the DM for like a day and think about what you would like to say. ,socialskills,dg9mikp,1,t5_2r275
11635341,0,t3_6611lg,gt  if he wants to do stuff behind our backs fineEh no. This person is renting a place to live from your bf. As his landlord your bf gets to make the house rules including the rule dont mess with my dog not even behind my back.Roommate complies and leaves the dog alone roommate gets to stay.  Roommate does not comply hes out on the street the dog is left alone and you now have room for a tenantroommate that is mature and sensible.edit wait wat. its your bfs house. its your bfs dog. its your bfs roommate. why are you the one asking this question?,socialskills,dgevn6u,5,t5_2r275
11662627,0,t1_dggq1li,Interesting possibility although my sister doesnt really say mate. Most women I know dont. So I dont know what about me saying mate would make her insecure. Do you think shes worried people will think her brother is gay?,socialskills,dghz2a7,1,t5_2r275
11684923,0,t3_66k9of, Fantastic advice. I sometimes shift between a Joe and a Steve but I always realize how much more fulfilling it is to be Joe. I often tell friends who feel embarrassed or insecure about their genuine interests to own it. The only thing making someone seem strange is reservation or a lack of confidence in themselves and their interests.Sure theres a level of socially accepted enthusiasm that needs to be observed which can be tricky but I think that being an occasionally overbearing Joe will still net someone more success than a perfect Steve.If I may add something I think its also important to understand that youre not going to become friends with everyone. This sounds like something everyone knows but I think a key trait of a Steve is the desire to fit in with and be palatable to everyone. This only leads to unhappiness. Your uniqueness might lead some to conclude that they wouldnt prefer a friendship with you but thats fine. ,socialskills,dgki4s3,3,t5_2r275

11799289,0,t3_68bpj6,Id recommend to read some books on social skills. Even if you think youre good theres always room for a lot of improvement. Its good to try lots of new things and talk to more people. Go out more thats where people are. Invite people to things. This is a skill and you should be good at this. Doesnt always work out but thats part of it. You have to take the initiative and basically be a leader if you are going to develop a good social circle. People are kinda flakey and have so many options that its easy to take personal but try not to. Eventually you will meet more and more people and develop friendships. Friendships develop with regular positive experiences. ,socialskills,dgxhniq,1,t5_2r275
