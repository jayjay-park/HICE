7348509,0,t1_d2dc0p4,It isnt abandond. Im experimenting with some small pet projects to get enough experience to continue developing Stardust. So far the game has a movable ship that uses fuel that is calculated based on speed two moving speeds and there is also two spacestations. On the main you can buy fuel by opening a little UI. Im now experimenting with random asteroid generation and adding a currency system and some more stats and UI ellements. Im also looking forward to Android porting.Edit damn I need to add a CSS theme to this sub like I did over rSpaceAgency...,StarDustTheGame,d2dh44y,1,t5_395bx
