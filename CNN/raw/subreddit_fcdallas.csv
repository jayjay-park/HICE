1749367,0,t3_2eciya,Want to buy a jersey with a players name and number on the back?Watch more games. Learn more about the players. Find players that you like and then determine who is likely to stay or not.More obvious big stars would be Diaz or Castillo although Id say its a pretty good bet that some homegrownplayers like Acosta or Ulloa will become stars in the near future.John is a fanfavorite but with his injuries Im not sure if hell play again for the team. Perez is really good but given that twothirds of MLS fans would be happy to see his demise this may not be a good choice.Are you from the Dallas area? If not perhaps getting the jersey of a player from your own area of origin would be a good idea. Or maybe your favorite college. A UNC grad could rep both his club and collegiate teams with a Zach Loyd jersey especially if they hail from Oklahoma.,fcdallas,cjzo0mr,1,t5_2spq4

5408730,0,t1_cw300pa,Shield. The cup is an American concept that measures who is peaking at the end of a season  a fun but meaningless concept.  The Shield is the ultimate measurement as it is in every major European league of a clubs talent depth commitment and ability. It measures at any given moment who was the best team during the better part of a  month season.  I can see why a fan would want the cup especially an American fan but the Shield has to be the ultimate goal for the club amp players. If Dallas limped into the playoffs and managed to steal the cup I still dont think I could claim we deserve to put a star above our crest... see COLORADO .,fcdallas,cw30xly,4,t5_2spq4
5727488,0,t3_3thoys,I see you got your tickets already so Im just stopping in to say we are excited you are going to be able to make it up there! I think this may be the most hyped game FC Dallas has ever played at home so it should be unreal wherever you end up! Try make it up there early as there is usually a pretty good party going on beforehand. DBG LSL and EM should all be out tailgating on the South East corner and there will be plenty of people in the bars around the stadium too. Helps get the energy level up before kickoff! Hope you have a good time.,fcdallas,cx71ubl,3,t5_2spq4
5817196,0,t1_cxi2ldg,I agree with that he played a huge part early on in the season. Its just tough to see your players give up on plays and walk around on the field. I remember during the Seattle game he just let Rose saunter right past him and didnt even stick a leg out.,fcdallas,cxi6eid,1,t5_2spq4
5855117,0,t1_cxn4h2q,Zimmerman needs another season or two before I want him starting every game at CB. I agree that Watson at RB has grown on me as well I could not understand it when I first saw him lining up out there.Loyd is a tough one he does so well and works so hard to make CB his spot but he is just not tall enough we saw this against the Sounders and Portland. Set pieces he is the target to get exploited. He cant play CB another season and you cant bench him so he gets Watsons spot at RB.Hollingshead cannot perform the defensive tasks required for him to play LB.I feel all  positionsStriker CB and LB are equally important at this point if we want to do as well or better next season.,fcdallas,cxn4ug3,4,t5_2spq4
