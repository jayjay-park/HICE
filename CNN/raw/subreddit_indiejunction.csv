2635676,0,t3_2q0qo5,Great game using it as my main time waster today and looks like it will become a favorite. Only issue Ive found is it sometimes doesnt let me buy inventory slots for a few turn even when I have the money. Just means I have to manage my inventory better I suppose. The music did have to go away after a while because the volume level was louder than my other apps I was switching between. Keep up the great work and thanks for the game!,indiejunction,cn2m6vv,2,t5_33joo
