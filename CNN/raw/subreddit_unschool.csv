You can learn engineering from online courses etc. Ill concede that certifications for some professions in some countries usually require formal schooling  doctors dentists and psychiatrists etc. in the USA or UK.Scientific research is done by everyone everywhere. The kind that happens at Universities is a very specific kind and it is having its own struggles right now. Formal degrees arent needed to do scientific research by any means.I can see your point about people that want to transition from unschooling to a University but you seem to be looking for a problem where there isnt one. If you want to become a licensed doctor in the US then you need to figure out what you need to do to get your license that might require school so youll have to look for options and what they each require. If none of them will let you in without passing the entrance exam then you need to study those things plain and simple.It isnt that unschooling means you cant have goals and cant achieve them in a linear fashion. It just means that not every child is forced to have those specific goals.Should we change the way those licenses get assigned? Should we allow people to practice medicine without a license? Practice law? Probably but those are very big things to try and change and were talking about a very small portion of people that are being excluded for this particular reason.,unschool,cy0l7f2,1,t5_2rnbs

6745638,0,t1_d0h1845,Now you have me looking for things Ive shared in the past instead of going out to work Im learning to make a living as a street magician in New Orleans.Another grown unschooler keeps a blog called Little House in the Big Park. I have shown people a few of her posts.,unschool,d0h20mp,2,t5_2rnbs

Then again if you would use a term like unschooling theory I assume you must be one of these creepspedagogues who thinks that unschooling is another method of education ...in which case it makes sense that you wouldnt see any foundational difference between unschooling and progressive schooling.I just looked at your user page and it seems I am correct. And a Google search for unschooling theory reveals that creeps are the only ones that are saying it. The Friedman article doesnt count because it is actually Unschooling Theory.Im telling you the fact of the matter is that being a trained teacher or other education expert is an active impediment to being able to think of children as actual people and therefore to properly understanding unschooling. Unschooling theory? If there is any such subject it is the psychology of learning which includes no presumptions at all about children being a different species or that its up to us wise and benevolent adults to know whats best for them or really anything resembling the progressive school of thought.I think most adults are so far from thinking of children as people that the only way they can come up with correct conceptions of childrens learning or correct manners towards children or thinking rationally about childrens rights or ... is to think about people in general  not children specifically  and then apply their conclusions to children. If this is correct then progressivism must be wrong or flawed right off the bat.Im willing to grant that the progressives are less worse than the traditionalists. Edit But John Holt thought that the opposite might be the case.,unschool,d1vaknc,1,t5_2rnbs
11637436,0,t1_dgf2ncf,Cool!Holt and Kohn are great.Ivan Illichs Deschooling Society will give you more of a philosophical footing and a better understanding of the forces arrayed against you.John Taylor Gattos Dumbing Us Down is a great source for more accessible anecdotes and ways of expressing things.Peter Gray Free to Learn is the leading academic right now and a great source of research and statistics on selfdirected learning.If you want to change laws theres a lot of books that are not about unschooling but which will help you on your journey. Read Dale Carnegies How to Build Friends and Influence People and read Saul Alinskys Rules for Radicals. Also read about the history of how homeschooling remained legal in the USA and in the UK which are the most homeschoolfriendly places that I know of. Each has its own reasons and neither is based on the benefits of unschooling. An indirect approach often works best.Please keep us updated on your reading and politicking adventures!,unschool,dgf477t,5,t5_2rnbs
