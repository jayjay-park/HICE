The only thing I could think that UG would offer RG is that it gets jace and zegana. Sure you can use permission spells like dissolve in it but over all I feel like you are just attempting to be a worse version of RG monsters.

But it does something useful and its also more flexible because Stony Silence does nothing against Twin or Jund two other decks I named against which Suppression Field is pretty handy. Suppression Field also interacts in minor ways with Pod and Tron by making their Gavony Townships and Eye of Ugins harder to activate. Beyond that Field is randomly good against  color control decks because of those decks strong reliance on fetchlands for mana fixing and planeswalkers for valuegenerating and it might be alright against the Genesis Wave deck if that turns out to be a real thing by taxing Arbor Elf and Garruk Wildspeaker.,spikes,cemgo9j,3,t5_2utkz

131353,0,t3_1vkiy1,Actually I quite like the deck. I wonder if it cant be described as a deck similar to monoblack devotion which has an advantage in the mirror? The most different cards are surprisingly alike to the monoblack equalivents. Blood Baron of Vizkopa vs Gray Merchant Master of Waves vs Desecration Demon Jace Architect of Thought vs Underworld Connections Detention Sphere vs Heros DownfallIt basically imitates monoblack and does it very well. Its not devotion but its midrange  threats including Ashiok amp Elspeth is very close to the magic number of  midrange threats and it does indeed play good stuff cards as obvious in the above comparison. It also has  sources of black for the turn two pack rat. I imagine using Pack Rat to threaten taking over the game and if not succeeding  most of the time instead taking the game over with one of six other major threats MoWBBV chosen to be quite great against the meta.I wouldnt mind reducing the mana strain  sources  blue by opting for no Supreme Verdicts sb or Detention Spheres but maybe its necessary even if risky. Did a quick calculation and the joint probability of at least a blue and a white mana by turn three should be somewhere around  so not too bad at all.,spikes,cete1tq,6,t5_2utkz
133562,0,t3_1vkiy1,I think theres potential in this deck and Ill probably try some form of this at FNM.  If nothing else I hope it gives Ashiok some attention as I feel this card will be a player it just hasnt found the right home yet.  ,spikes,cetn4w4,1,t5_2utkz

156295,0,t1_ceg7qxo,Depends on what deck you are playing against.  If you play against a redx deck then their artifact removal is going to be post board.  Knowing that you need to always have  mana open or risk it being destroyed.  Against thoughtseize you need to drop it early and hope it doesnt get dsphered.

161446,0,t1_cewo1pq,Incidentally I actually play the modern deck top control incidentally and it doesnt really need much mana at all. Your highest cost card is usually Tezz and you dont need to even cast him until very late in the game. The only thing that needs rushing out is Ensnaring bridge which costs the same as the card in question. Other than that what you really need is your opponents top card revealed.

Add to that the more conditional removal spells that are very powerfulDark betrayal glare of heresy Orzhov Charm chain to the rocks and Selesnya charm.and I fail to see how a  mana sorcery speed removal spell capable of only removing a creature and not capable of producing card advantage has any impact on the format.  If anything I would think grisly spectacle would be preferable to Gild simply for the flexibility of instant speed.  The removal could only get better if they reprinted StP and Lightning Bolt.Honestly I think the problem is that BNG is just astoundingly mediocre.

BTE are out of teh question IMO since they are a devotion tool. Skarrg Guildmage give trample which is nice.

276359,0,t3_1x9dlh,I have tested White devotion extensively before BotG. I built several versions including monowhite splashblack splashblue and splashred. My overall conclusion is that it wasnt competitive because Heliod doesnt do enough for you. Vigilance and expensive tokens isnt as relevant as for example making creatures unblockable. Apart from Heliod the only reason for building up devotion was to cast Elspeth and Angel of Serenity but I found that to be too slow and unreliable even with x Nykthos. An additional problem was the lack of options to draw cards while you are aiming at a longer game. I tried adding Read the Bones or Sphinxs Revelation but neither really worked. In short white is better off not worrying about devotion and just building either an aggro deck with a splash of black or red or Orzhov midrange with Obzedat or Blood Baron. With BotG we have gotten two new tools Brimaz and Ephara. Brimaz will work fine in any deck aggro midrange and maybe even control. Ephara is where things get interesting. I intend to give UW devotion with a white focus another try because Ephara provides the card draw we need and theres a great synergy with Brimaz Precinct Captain Elspeth and Heliod.

413981,0,t3_1ytpfx,Ill say a few words from a judges perspective.If youre using a draw spell like Sphinxs Revelation for instance have them verbally confirm the number. At the least if the ruling goes bad itll be downgraded to a warning rather than a game loss. And appeal it like a motherfucker if you disagree at all. Seriously for some reason unknown to me more information comes up during an appeal but thats probably because either A the players miss something utterly obvious or B something was unstated and came up during an investigation.Case in point I was judging a GPT where a call came up over whether an opponent had an extra card he couldnt account for. I answered the appeal and it came up that Goblin Guide was involved and could possibly account for the extra card. Neither player mentioned that Goblin Guide could have flipped a land in the initial ruling.If nothing else play very clearly and deliberately. Due to the nature of competitive events people like to try bullshit judge calls to get an edge on an opponent. And if an appeal occurs it will come up if theyre lying.

592156,0,t3_20uptr,Other people have answered the question so Im going to toss in an interesting if somewhat tangental counterexampleI played YuGiOh way back in the day and the game was as balanced back then as Magic was a couple years after release. That is to say it was horribly horribly broken. I honestly kinda miss it so many cards were so hilariously overpowered that games were very sharp and you could go from winning to losing in a heartbeat.Some important things to note there were no colours restricting what you could play nor mana costs restricting when you play things so everyone could run all the most powerful cards and cast them essentially whenever. To balance this all the best cards were restricted to  per deck instead of the normal . Decks were also only  cards and there was no rule about mulligans since mana wasnt an issue starting hands were generally all at least playable. As a consequence a card that simply drew a card would actually have been good enough to play. It got you closer to the very best cards in your deck and a random card from the remaining  would almost always have more value than the th best card. Two similar cards did in fact exist and were both restricted one that drew two cards and one that was Draw  discard . Unsurprisingly every deck in existence ran both.So the upshot is that a truly free Draw a card spell would actually be fantastic but in magic no such card exists. Manamorphose messes with your mana curve Gitaxian Probe and Street Wraith cost  life and they all make your mulligans worse. Even  Draw a card probably wouldnt be played in the average deck the cost to your mulligans is likely worse than the benefit youd get from running a card deck.,spikes,cg7kyl6,3,t5_2utkz

777728,0,t1_cgscwnm,i have to agree here gw is already really good at removing fatties like demon polukranos even thassa with selesnya charm. the problem cards were always small mustanswer threats like pack rat and master of waves. one of the biggest problems for gw was that when master of waves hits the board they literally needed to have a banisher or they had very little chance. even when they land banisher it could easily be rapided to put them right back in the situation they were in before albeit with a tempo gain. setessan tactics is very good against both pack rat and master i could see a  split or  split between the charm and setessan tactics being very good for the deck. gw creatures are already high pt for their mana costs so generally with the added  they should be able to fight creatures pretty favorably. the tempo loss from the tap down part of tactics however is very real. certainly not negligible.,spikes,cgsok3e,1,t5_2utkz

You dont have the luxury of holding open countermagic every turn. The deck is inherently proactive. Youre doing the most powerful thing in standard. Its your opponents job to respond to you not the other way around. Most of the cards you listed dont matter or arent worth diluting your devotion count for.The only area where counters are useful is as part of a specific strategy vs UWx control. In these games the plan is to let them kill all of your threats with s and use countermagic to stop their haymakers elspeth rev jace aetherling. They eventually just run out of gas then die to a few small threats. Your countermagic is very bad at executing this plan.

One of the big ups of Melira Pod is that while its basically a midrange beatdown deck theres always the threat of the combo looming and opponents have to play around that. That being said it is a cool deck and I like having space for things like Resto Angel and MB Thoughtseizes. Im not sure which I like better but I think if I were to be building one of the two right now Id go with the normal Melira build just because its tried and true and its not hard to add the extra angels later if you want to convert it.,spikes,ci2jma5,2,t5_2utkz

1202932,0,t3_27vwm6,I really dislike the cantrips. Probe is bad because it makes mulligans harder and is bad against aggro which due to your lack of Bolt Helix and Electrolyze your deck is already weak to Quicken is bad because its too cute and once again makes mulligans harder and Serum Visions is bad because youre not digging for specific cards and cant get value bottoming lands late game because you want to hit those anyways for your Revs and Cryptics.Consider playing some Remands which is practically a two mana Dismiss against Flashback and counterspells return your own spell that was countered. It also helps keep your Mana Leaks live mid to late game. Play the th Cryptic because that card is insane and play some number of Restoration Angels because a you play  Snapcaster b its an instant speed threat to pressure decks you cant tap out against like Twin or Scapeshift and c its insane vs aggro.Personally I really like a tech  Shadow of Doubt which kills fetch lands to keep Mana Leak live and shores up the Scapeshift Tron and Pod matchups.

It also can help you get a little bit of damage out of your Young Pyromancer before it goes on chump blocking duty in the Monsters matchup and gives you an extra turn aginst the Stormbreath Dragon.

1568310,0,t3_2c7obj, Peer through Depths vs Serum Visions I myself prefer Peer and have run that configuration for a long time for the leasons you listed mostly. I understand it as if the cheaper mana cost along with hiding away action to the top of your library vs BG is what makes Visions more played. I did ask a skilled friend of mine to convince me to run Visions over Peer and his answer was I cant do that Peer is better. So well Id have to try some more but I like Peer too much. EDIT I gave it some thinking and realize the answer is more obvious Its not about comparing the quality of the effect you get its realizing we only have  drops without Bolt and in Modern running something like  drops is way more optimal. Lightning Bolt can be dropped nowadays as Zoo is worse and its mostly a good card if creatures are x. Many top lists have indeed dropped Bolt and I would too if the local meta allows it. BG rock Its the worst matchup and not much can be done to make it better. Running Obstinate Baloths in the sideboard helps a bit and will try running a SB Courser of Kruphix too. Visions would be better than Peer here. You keep the lands with a lot of lands and ramp and if you have interruption count on some getting discarded.  Not finding Scapeshift is in my opinion best resolved by adding Gifts Ungiven to the deck search for ScapeshiftSnapcasterNoxious RevivalEternal WitnessX. The reason is that this solves a number of other issues as well not least being able to speed up the combo one turn by giftsing for ramp or sideboard cards not least vs lists with countermagic since they often cant afford to counter Gifts  and then you punish them by searching for countermagic. I dislike Clutch because if you have Scapeshift its very weak. Gifts Ungiven is not weak. As for your list you run unconventionally many ramp spells many people have cut some of those as you mentioned as well as four Snapcasters which is  too much. If you drop two ramp spells I suggest  each of FarseekTribeElder you might wanna add a land though.This is the list Im testing right now Giftshift,spikes,cjcv0bp,1,t5_2utkz

1599384,0,t1_cjgqpws,Yeah I dont think Cosis is all that great. Especially in a world where there are a lot of newer players to Modern who may not have fetches Id much rather have Cursecatcher. I like you using Spell Pierce MB rather than Remand. I like Remand for what it does but its still  whole mana that we often cant afford to leave up. Ill definitely have to try out Pierces main.I  agree with you with Master of Waves. Card is fucking house and is one of the absolute best topdecks Merfolk has to offer. Im thinking of upping the count to  myself just because I loved it so much.Thanks for posting your list. I always like seeing peoples variations of the deck.,spikes,cjgrs2v,3,t5_2utkz
1601877,0,t1_cjh2v82,Weaver is by far one of the best Engine cards that is in standard. I think you might not have played enough games with him against enough decks.Were I to switch to a more explosive version the only change Id make is taking out the Coursers and moving the Heralds back maindeck as well as finding a spot for the nd Jarad. Ultimate Prices are unfortunately the cost of doing business right now. No version of the Dredge deck that Ive seen can beat Pack Rat every single game. Its an unfortunate concession that youre forced to make.You are right though. Ive opted for a more slow consistent deck. I played the original Conley version and I liked it but I did not like the hands where I sat there spinning my wheels dumping things in the yard and not accomplishing anything.The question when you go to a tournament is Do you want to be the MonoRed guy the one with the potentially devastatingly explosive deck that runs into brick walls occasionally that you cant recover from but every rd match you just win for free because your draw was amazing? Or do you want to be more consistent and be able to draw out of those bad spots much easier and be able to outplay opponents while sacrificing that free third match?,spikes,cjh33co,2,t5_2utkz

1605018,0,t3_2cnk7u,Ive actually play tested a very similar list! Really glad to see someone else posting something similar. Based on my experience this list has a lot of trouble with aggro but can completely stomp midrange and control decks. Heres what I recommendPlay more Llanowar Wastes the ability to play a turn two Caryatid without taking any damage is awesome. Golgari Charm isnt good main board. Its rarely going to offer you anything that Abrupt Decay or Vraska cant handle. The only relevant mode seems to be a regeneration against a Supreme Verdict... but even then youre not running enough creatures to validate that. Cyclonic rift is also not that great as youll rarely be able to do anything more than attack with a Prognostic Sphinx and maybe a Courser. I would recommend the fourth Heros Downfall cutting a land playing two Bile Blight which devastate aggro playing one Urborg Tomb of Yawgmoth. I also recommend finding room for Ashiok who is wonderful in this deck. Also Read the Bones offers excellent card draw in this deck. EDIT I was trying to think about how I made room for Ashiok and Read the Bones in this deck and I realized that I eventually ended up cutting Thoughtseize. I found that the insane amount of removal I was running didnt really care about what you were holding in your hand. I go back and forth on that though. ,spikes,cjhhb9i,1,t5_2utkz

Againstthe jace ultimate he has to take his wincon from your deck because he doesnt play one.  the fix to this is simple  dont play one either.  Against the elixir wincon make sure that you have a way to win that the control player cannot disrupt by the time youve drawn your deck.  Against the mutavaults you can either stall or else somehow make them not matter.  The Meta call I would make is...Mazes End.

The deck is down x  mana  power creatures.  If there are none of these in Khans RDW is at a somewhat significant nerf.You could do this for the entire decklist  Im not a RDW player and wouldnt know the ramifications of every card change but a dedicated player like Zemanja...Zeman...Jemanzaski could probably do it.It would still be entirely theoretical since we dont know what cards are coming but it would be an analysis that would give RDW in this example a nice framework for starting their theorycrafting once Khans drops.,spikes,cjunoor,0,t5_2utkz

Xenagos the PW should be higher and Kiora and Garruk shouldnt be in the deck IMO.I run RUG and Ive had success playing competitively. Granted I do just play online and at FNMs but I thoroughly enjoy the deck and believe that it has advantages over Jund. Im not saying one is better than the other because I feel that argument is not necessary here. Cyclonic Rift and Negate are the best reasons to splash blue. Negate works so well against so many decks in standard. Cyclonic Rift is one of the most powerful cards that this deck has to offer. Being able to overload it is common and the advantage gained by sending everything back to your opponents hand is backbreaking.I think youre being a bit hard on this guy by not actually offering him advice and instead saying no one will take this deck seriously.

1875451,0,t1_ckf1jtf,I think the key to this is that they get to play an aggro deck that can quickly spin into a different stance. Cards like Anafenza and Rhino are perfect for this. You can play a traditional aggro deck and use Anafenza as a beater and rhino as reach similar to how Falkenrath Aristocrat was used. But if you play a super fast aggro deck you can board out your  drops board in a few removal cards and then you end up with this slightly undersized midrange deck. So many of the cards serve two purposes and that is in my opinion their strength. Cards like Lion Brimaz Anafenza Rhino Deathdealer and all of their removal all serve dual roles very well. ,spikes,ckf6o53,1,t5_2utkz

Sultai has access to the best removal in the format and Disdainful Stroke could be a very relevant spell if the environment is as midrange as its likely to be. On the aggro end of things getting to run Caryatids and Coursers seems like a perfectly control thing to do  The Bant control decks of last standard found the time to cast Farseek and Farseek doesnt block. Courser nets you life and card advantage while holding off the assault.You could even go really deep use Embodiment of Spring instead of Caryatid and run Extinguish All Hope. Blocks as well as Caryatid accelerates you to your sweeper and your sweeper doesnt kill your card advantagelife engine.I think Sultai Delve Control has the best chances of being a deck in this nearly sweeperless world.

I agree that the card is incredibly powerful and usually more optimal than something like Steam Augury but most cards used in standard see play because they fill a niche like playing secondfiddle to Impulse.When considering the disadvantages of giving your opponent choices and information also consider how you can exploit how heshe can extract value from that.

The reason I split the DespiseThoughtseize was because of my interpretation of the meta.  I feel like the format is creature driven and Despise acts practically like a Thoughtseize while preserving my life total.

2093804,0,t1_cl5y570,I am playing a graveyard deck right now too hence my questions.  Based on my testing Sidisi is more a value card and not a haymaker or threat that needs to be strongly protected at  toughness and no protection of any kind it is difficult.  Despite her Legendary status I think she is a of in a graveyard deck because of all the effects she provides as youve listed.  She is a removal magnet  she will get bounced exiled killed put on top of the deck and then milled off her own attack trigger  its part of the cost in getting so much value out of her.To maximize her value you probably want to run around  or more creatures in your deck.  I didnt do the math to figure out the exact threshold but I figure theres some number around there so that her mill trigger gets you a zombie almost every time.As for Elspeth I think the main way to do that is to run Herald of Torment.  Its an evasive  body to get around  soldiers and her board wipe effect.  Herald also transforms any of your mana dorks or Satyr Wayfinders into  flyers with bestow insurance.  It can also curve Sidisi into a  flying Grave Titan.,spikes,cl5yvt4,2,t5_2utkz

And I fail to see how having a dead card in play is any different than having a dead card in hand. Either way youre still waiting to draw something to use the mana on so whether it sits in your hand or in play is irrelevant.

All things being equal that would be the ONLY determining factor right?If you want to troll people like a bitch go find a casual subreddit. Otherwise man up and state an opinion and back it up!. Quite honestly I dont care. Both cards have plusminus factors that would depend largely on the deck they are in. All I did was point out that a turn five Dictate gives you a turn six Wealth for nine. Turn five Kruphix doesnt do that. Flash also makes it less vulnerable to Banishing Light.

Her  only hits Stormbreath which youll most likely have some mixture of Heros Downfall and Silence the Believers and shes vulnerable to air which is the major strength that Jeskai brings to the table against Abzan  reach that is. I actually like Utter End against Jeskai because it can hit Sarkhan or Banishing Light which allows you to sometimes get an extra Siege Rhino or Wingate Roc activation. This match really is about Siege Rhinos just grinding it out they cant put up effective fights against the Rhinos. You can try to play around Disdainful Stroke but I might try to just run threats that arent as important into Disdainful Stroke for me thats probably Wingate Roc first and then Sorin and then Ill go to Siege Rhino.

Ive seen legit lists running UWR with  stomping grounds for drev as it is splash black you get access to some sweet sideboard tech and possibly allows you to run tribal flames in the main.

2271417,0,t3_2l899w,I tried running Treasure Cruise as a singleton in monoU Merfolk. It was generally good  if I had it in a hand with creatures I could just run them out start beating face then if the creatures get put in the graveyard I could Treasure Cruise for more creatures. However Ive come to think that playing Treasure Cruise is not the best thing we can be doing with our deck right now. The meta has taken a massive shift towards Treasure Cruise. This has had a couple of huge effects. Most of the top decks are running a TON of drops to help fuel Treasure Cruises. This means that Chalice of the Void is now absurdly powerful against pretty much any deck you can expect to face. . Most decks are running Islands now to cast Treasure Cruise. This means islandwalk is almost always naturally online! Because of these two factors I am playing x Chalice of the Void maindeck with the intention of dropping it turn two as often as possible. In the last few days I have had such a fun time shutting down Delver Burn Boggles and Soul Sisters before they get started. I also moved all four Spreading Seas to the sideboard and took out Vapor Snags dont want to have them in hand with Chalice out on X. This opened up space in the maindeck to run more countermagic. Im currently running x Mana Leak and x Remand. Also because Burn and Boggles are everywhere and just because its a good card Ive got two Spellskite in the main right now. Once youve got a Cavern andor Vial on board you can run out the second vial on X to totally shut out decks like Delver Burn Boggles Soul Sisters and others.

2277065,0,t1_clt4fu7,The deck is super solid right now you still run mainboard blood moons because your mana base is built to support that and it can REALLY screw people up frequently since going into turn  people can put you on delver or twin then boom blood moon. Even against UR delver ive had games in testing where they have to draw one of their  islands to get out of it and they just never hit a blue source. Also even just  blue source post blood moon can ruin their game. No longer snap back any blue only one counter per turn just so much stuff.Against some decks turn  blood moon just makes them scoop.But even when blood moon doesnt do anything the deck still has vedalken shackles which is a fantastic card right now. Beyond those two core cards its probably just the best straight up control list in the meta. It can shut out games I think in a more clear and dominant way than UWR.

Im playing Boros Burn and Jeskai Tempo in standard right now. My Boros Burn is basically just Jeskai Tempo with a lower curve and CttR and Searing Blood. I still think Searing Blood is great right now. The core of my list is  Monastery Swiftspear   Seeker of the Way   Goblin Rabblemaster   Lightning Strike   Searing Blood   Stoke the Flames   Magma Jet   Chained to the Rocks   Lands  The last  cards are some combination of Hushwing Gryff Phoenix Arc Lightning Hordeling Outburst Deflecting Palm or Ride Down. It has good matchup against aggro a fine matchup against Jeskai and a lot of Abzan lists but a bad matchup against GR Monsters and some Whip lists. The bad matchups are the reasons Im leaning towards Jeskai. When the new sets come out we might get a better selection of burn and hopefully an aggressive flier thats mostly what the deck needs. EDIT Does anyone have a good maindeck and sideboard that has a better matchup against GR Monsters? Thats the main reason Im not playing Boros Burn right now.

2331654,0,t3_2m0p24,Lots of reasons.WWW isnt that easy to cast for one thing.  mana is a lot for a creature that when it comes out is just a  with no haste. Triple white is a lot when most standard decks want to be at least  colors even . Most monocolored decks are more focused on aggro and so a  drop isnt really something theyre interested in.Also this is one of those classic dies to removal situations. They can easily kill Avacyn with a  mana spell Charms Downfall Stoke etc. and you will have gained no value off of playing her. So its a very easy spell to blank. Thats not what you want from your  mana spells in constructed. You want to be casting a planeswalker or a haste creature or a creature that gives you some kind of value when ETB likeing making a token or something.If you get to untap with Avacyn you have access to a lot of extra abilities its true and she swings for a lot but the fact that she cannot gives protection to herself is a big deal. This implies you want to play Avacyn in decks with a lot of other creatures youd want to give protection to but that means youre probably running an aggro like build and as was said above this is too clunky for aggro. Or if youre running some midrange build with just efficient creatures theres better cards over Avacyn in that strategy.

2335602,0,t3_2m2g7s,Hey I responded to your other post but Im going to go a little more in depth here on my thoughts about GR midrange decks. You essentially have two flavors of GR midrange GR monsters and Gr devotion. GR monsters plays like an aggro deck with ramp. You are aiming for plays like T goblin Rabblemaster T polukranos T stormbreath. These builds are much heavier into R than devotion lists and can justify permanents that have RR in their costs.Gr devotion plays like a traditional devotionramp into fatties. You are aiming to develop an overwhelming board presence with dorks and walkers and loads of G symbols to get huge returns on Nykthos and your X cost spells.First figure out which of these builds youd like to play. They are actually very different despite sharing a lot of cards. If you want a deck that ideally requires an answer from your opponent every turn and threatens to end games TT play monsters. If you want to goldfish and not interact with your opponent and then drop a  genesis hydra or  damage craters claws on TT play devotion.Personally Im a bigger fan of devotion. I run the full  Xenagos  Nykthos  craters claws  dorks etc. this deck has one plan generate huge quantities of mana and go over the top. The monsters list is way more aggressive and every game is a race monsters lists have less inevitably. On the other hand monsters gets some hands that are near unbeatable on the play but I found it less consistent overall which is why I switched to devotion.,spikes,cm0e5to,6,t5_2utkz
2346724,0,t1_cm1kebz,In my opinion a tier  deck piloted perfectly has an edge against a tier  deck in the hands of an inexperienced pilot. Generally speaking it is much easier to get reps in with decks that you enjoy playing. So in a format with no clear dominant deck the best deck to play is whichever tier  archetype you enjoy playing the most since it is likely that you will have more experience navigating the various lines of play in different matchups. If you know you are up against a skewed metagame that is dominated by a certain archetype then the best deck may be the one with the most hate for that archetype but this seems unlikely given the diversity of the current standard. As of right now there are competitive midrange decks in all  clan wedges GR and GB devotionconstellation decks the UW and Jeskai heroic decks Ascendancy combo UBUW control Boss Sligh and perhaps a couple others Im forgetting. Thats at least  decks that have solid game against an unknown field so there ought to be at least one that you genuinely enjoy playing. ,spikes,cm1rlq7,5,t5_2utkz

Ripping an eidolon off the top to deal lethal is why  of these guys are in the maindeck. Moreover singing bell curve is a tutorable removal spell.

2444128,0,t3_2ngvfl,It really depends on what your deck is trying to do. UB Control for example wants to go pretty long and get out lots of lands. For this you probably want more fetchables than fetches. On the other hand if youre playing more creatureheavy variants of Jeskai youre looking to finish games off faster which means you can run less basics than fetchlands Even the deck that Shaun Mclaren was running at the PT with its  Dig Through Times ran  Flooded Strand  Island and  Plains. In eternal formats having enough fetchables isnt really an issue. In Modern you wont have Standards problem because fetchlands turn into shocks so its like fetching up a temple in standard almost so your basic count is just for playing around Blood Moon and Tectonic Edge. In Legacy games are so fast that youre probably not going to run out of fetchable targets save the Miracles matchup but if it goes that long youre likely losing anyway. You can have a few basics to play around Wasteland but its not really that necessary unless youre trying to go long.,spikes,cmdsrj4,1,t5_2utkz

The synergy btw Outburst and rabble  direct synergy as well as operating along the same basic strategy  means that Charm will get pushed out.If you slow down your deck and opt for a more midrangecontrolling mode the Charm is excellent. It is one of your best tools versus any control deck very good against UWR lists useful for getting Elspeths out of the hand of bigger abzan lists kills coursers wrecks monored decks packed with Xs.The card is itself very powerful. The relevant question is not whether it is good enough  the question is what does its inclusion push out and what does this do to the rest of your list. The format is packed with good  drops and mardu is no exception. You still want  crackling doom as it is the best removal spell in the format bar none. So you have charms and you have doom and you probably still want some of the  cmc burn. Your list becomes very removal heavy and your strategy has to adjust accordingly. luckily Mardu has the tools to play a midrange game  you have access to all the best removal spells sideboard discard etc etc. I recommend giving it a try but keep in mind that the card takes you in a different direction than you may be used to. ,spikes,cmetgvp,3,t5_2utkz

2528758,0,t3_2omw3v,My list runs both and its done pretty well. The only thing about running both is that it makes your deck slower I run  Sarkhan  Rocs  SBDs and more reliant on decent draws. I am considering cutting one of the creatures or doing and in the main because of that. In my opinion though Stormbreath Dragons have won me more games that I wasnt already winning than the Rocs have. Every time I am able to raid the Roc I usually already had a good enough board state to not need them Butcher is just a better play if you have something you plan on attacking with which most of the time are the goblins or the cheap creatures. The lifegain is nice but rarely needed thanks to Butcher. IMO Rocs will do better in an aggroheavy meta where the lifegain will put you way out of their reach if you arent already. SBDs will help you against controloriented meta because haste makes them really uncomfortable. SBD is also good against abzan since it goes through their rocs and shuts down some of their removals. If you dont play in either of these meta however I would advise you try running both and see how they feel when you draw one whether you feel like youd rather have the other and etc.. ,spikes,cmon814,3,t5_2utkz

I had early removal for his mantis riders  blockers for his Rabblemasters and then easily closed out the game once I found a whip. Only dropped game  due to flooding out pretty hard and him finding an erase for the whip I did have.Round  vs Jeskai Tokens Won  without any resistance. Game  he overextended and I destroyed the board with a Doomwake Giant. Game  he put up a bit more resistance but a turn  Sidisi into zombie put up enough defense that I could get the whip engine online.Round  vs Abzan Midrange planeswalker heavy build Won . Opponent mulliganed game  and I had  thoughtsiezes so I got out ahead and the opponent never had a chance to catch up. Game  he got  planeswalkers on the board at once at one point but he couldnt find an answer for my whip and I ground him down on resources until the game eventually ended in a draw with me likely to win in a few more turns.Round  vs color Whip with the splash for Rhino and Soul of Theros Lost  Game  I mulliganed to a bad  cards and even with a weak draw from the opponent the board stalled out and the opponent found their copy of Soul of Theros after Id exhausted all of my removal. Eventually after a  minute marathon he won the game. I probably should have conceeded much earlier. We attempted a game  but with not much time left a draw was pretty much inevitable.Round  vs UW heroic Won  This is not an easy matchup but I managed to get there.  copies of Dead Drop in my sideboard were instrumental to me winning the match being huge blowouts both times that I managed to cast them. They definitely earned their place in the sideboard in this matchup. Also Sidisi was a very nice card to have in this matchup Creating black creatures in addition to the satyr wayfinders and what not I have in green meant that a single protection spell was not enough to push through most of the creatures giving me enough time to get my whip engine online.Round  vs Jeskai Tokens Drew  Game  I was a nailbiter. I stabilized down at  life with him having  cards in hand and an ascendancy on the board and I went down to  or less life  more times before I finally lost after about  minutes of trading. I could never get quite far enough ahead to turn the corner and he eventually burned me out. Game  I got his ascendancy with a Sultai Charm and after that he couldnt really assemble anything. He cruised twice but didnt manage to find anything to halt my offence. Game  was started with only  minutes left and I was solidly in the lead for most of the game but couldnt close it out in time drawing the final game.,spikes,cmp8w4y,1,t5_2utkz

2584387,0,t3_2pe8mn,Hi there! First post in rspikes but I might be able to help here. I competed in a PPTQ with this deck last Saturday and placed top . My only losses were to Abzan Midrange in my third round I was crushed and Abzan Whip incredibly close in the semi finals.I did make one change to the deck though I took out both Chandras and added in two Anger of the Gods. My reasoning is that I live in the Bay area in an incredibly competitive meta which generally fluctuates with whatever deck is doing the best at the time. I went in expecting a good number of Sidsi Whip builds similar to Shahars and Jeskai Tokens. Anger absolutely wrecks both decks and when I sideboard into control it ends up being easier to take control of the board when I have  board wipes at hand. I would potentially make changes though since I am not certain what Id do versus UW Heroic.Match  Temur Aggro Out x Rabblemaster x Anger of the Gods x Lightning StrikeIn x Disdainful Stroke x End HostilitiesI imagine Id board the exact same way versus RG Monsters though I might leave in an Anger or two depending on if I see Hornet Queen or notMatch  Mardu Midrange Out x Rabblemaster x Seeker of the WayIn x Disdainful Stroke x Anger of the Gods x Glare of Heresy This build was heavy in the planeswalkers so I definitely wanted disdainful strokes. I knew he would board into Anger of the Gods as well so I decided I wouldnt give him any worthwhile targets for that or Crackling Doom and just control the board long enough to burn him out after hitting him with tokens. Save burn for when you dont have Angers so you can hit any big threats Stoke is good to keep in hand as well in case the opponent plays Butcher. I might have also brought in an End Hostilities and taken out the th SeekerMatch  Abzan Midrange Out x Rabblemaster x Seeker of the Way x Anger of the GodsIn x Disdainful Stroke x End Hostilities x Glare of Heresy x Elspeth Suns Champion These matches were rough and I was solidly beat both games. Anger doesnt do much against these decks so I boarded out of them. By far this is the worst matchup Ive seen for this deck as they start sticking threats like Roc and Rhino and I run out of answers faster and faster. I might make some sideboard changes in the future to deal with it. Oh and I might have boarded in Erase to hit courser but Im pretty sure I didntMatch  Sidisi Whip Out x Rabblemaster x Seeker of the Way x Jeskai Ascendency x Lightning Strike x Stoke the FlamesIn x Disdainful Stroke x Anger of the Gods x End Hostilities x Elspeth Suns Champion x EraseMatches went exactly as I expected first game Im at a pretty significant disadvantage and unless I could kill him before he resolves a Whip he did and I was screwed. Games  and  were perfect though. Used Stokes to kill Coursers if I saw them Erase and Disdainful Stroke I saved until they tryed to resolve a Whip since it is so crucial to their game Anger if they had anything besides doomwake or soul End Hostilities when they did. Your tokens will likely die to bile blight or drown in sorrow so dont worry too much about them. They likely side out of heros downfall so Elspeth is safe if you resolve her. Just know hell run out of gas before you as long as you stick a Treasure Cruise sometimeMatch  MonoRed Aggro Out x Rabblemaster x Jeskai Ascendency In x Anger of the Gods x Magma Spray x ErasePretty typical sideboard plan I included the Erases in case he brought in Eidolon of the Great Revel which can definitely hurt me. The great thing about the deck is I could throw out blockers with Outburst or Raise the Alarm and trade tokens with his creatures until he ran out of gas. Happened both games. Game  I killed  creatures of his with one of my mainboard Angers and it was incredibly satisfying. I left the Seekers in because the lifegain is highly relevant. Both games he almost burnt me out and the only thing that saved me was the little bit of lifegain I had from some early Seekers.Match  ??? We drew the game so we could both get into top Quarterfinals Sidisi Whip Exact same board plan as Match . Game  he was stuck on lands and I curved out perfectly. The opponent ended up scooping at turn . Game  I went into my control sideboard and again the game was as expected. Angered his board once and slowed him down after he resolved a Sidisi. My favorite play happened in this game Had an Ascendency on the board with  tokens. Played another Ascendency to trigger the first then Anger of the Gods to trigger both of the Ascendencys wiped his board and my tokens hit him for lethal since they were now .Semifinals Abzan Whip Out x Rabblemaster x Seeker of the Way x Anger of the Gods x Jeskai Ascendency x Lightning Strike x Stoke the FlamesIn x Disdainful Stroke x Glare of Hersey x End Hostilities x Elspeth Suns Champion x EraseId been talking to this guy all day and was excited to play against his deck. I felt like it would be harder than Sidisi Whip but easier than Abzan Midrange. Game  he ran me over similar to my Abzan Midrange opponent in match . Game  I was able to take control of the board and beat him to death with a few tokens. Game  was incredibly close though he eventually resolved a Whip. I couldnt find an Erase and my life total was down to . Whipped back a Wayfinder which hit a Siege Rhino and I had nothing to stop it on the next turn when he whipped it back. I had resolved Elspeth a few turns back and would have won on the next turn because of her. Fantastic game though.Final ThoughtsI really like this deck I feel like the only bad matchups are the Abzan ones at least from my experience. If I were to change anything I might pull out the Magma Sprays in the side an add a third Erase and a Stormbreath. I like the third Erase because it makes the Whip matches better. I can always hit a Courser or Doomwake with it. Stormbreath is for the Abzan matches. They almost always board out of their spot removal like Downfall and Murderous cut and board into Bile Blight and Drown in Sorrow. If they kept any spot removal it would be Abzan Charm which cant touch it. Additionally it can block Roc and Rhino if they resolve. Just a rough idea so Id be more than happy to listen to other suggestions.Edit So after some reasonable questions regarding sideboard decisions I remember I had read this thread a day before the PPTQ to get some idea how to sideboard.  I am definitely not the only one that thought about taking out Rabblemasters frequently,spikes,cmvx0vy,5,t5_2utkz

2600205,0,t1_cmxy12u,That list does sound familiar but Ill breakdown each card and my feelings on them. I used to play a list without Heliods Pilgrims and I was successful with my list mostly in FNM and testing. On a similar note in the Super Sunday Series Standard there was another UW Heroic player that literally picked up the deck that day and it showed by no means am I berating the player theres a point to this but he still Xd. The point Im making is that the shell of UW Heroic I believe is so good that pretty much any reasonable list can do well whether Pilgrims are included or not. Now with my experience both with and without Heliods Pilgrim I cant see going back. Pilgrim is such a good tool for the deck and I believe is an integral part of the deck and allows you to control your games much more than the non Pilgrim version. The major advantage to no Pilgrim is not having to play a  mana  but then you are much more left to the mercy of your draws and Im not going to play a deck where I hope to draw the right piece I need. Now for the rest of the list as I stated before UW Heroics gameplan game  is to be proactive as possible and killing your opponent as proficiently as possible. A card like Lagonna Band Trailblazer while excellent post board to combat the nonhard removal people board in is not as good as Favored Hoplite in getting them dead game . I am not at all a fan of Hopeful Eidolon in the deck due to its useless body and expensive bestow cost there are definitely  situations where it would be nice but the cons surely outweigh the pros. Also Eidolon of Countless Battles used to be popular but its lack of synergy with Heliods Pilgrim and it not being very good in general made it be cut from the deck. Im fine with  Stubborn Denials main because he card is very good and  is probably fine and in the contet of the deck  Ordeal of Heliod main is probably fine but not playing Heliods Pilgrim seems like a bad move if you dont want your gameplan to solely be dictated by your draws.,spikes,cmxzfqc,1,t5_2utkz

An important consideration here is that there are essentially no cards that can be dead in your hand in Mizes build besides the singleton Destructive Revelry.

I did a bunch of play testing today with both cards and Im starting to like Dig more than Cruise simply because you get to assemble combos better.  Its really good when your sitting at a high storm count but still havent yanked that Grapeshot.  By that point youve built up so much loose mana from Pyro AscPast in Flames interactions with stuff that you can almost hard cast it and just delve lands and stuff away.  edit Also discarding isnt terrible since you have past in flames.  Voice and Ravings are both useable. However the random discard from Ravings means you may hit a land.  So if your choice is between Voice and Ravings...Voice gives you room for a little strategy since you can discard a card you have two of with Pyro Asc out and get that counter going when the time comes.

2750332,0,t3_2rina7,Im actually thinking this works better in Jeskai than in some control deck. I think the drawback of manifest is being really underestimated here. Late game youre potentially drawing your opponent a huge threat that they can afford to flip while allowing them to draw another spell that can potentially be casted on the same turn. In a deck like Jeskai tempo you can better take advantage of the temporary disadvantage you put the opponent at since youre trying to win quickly.Say you Reality Shift a Siege Rhino and then swing in with your dudes. Even if you manifested them a creature lets say another Siege Rhino theyll have to choose between flipping the creature removing one of your guys or playing something else. Early game this can be enough of a tempo swing to pull ahead. Its also very relevant that flipping a Siege RhinoRocHornet Queenwhatever wont cause their ETB trigger to go off.I like that theres risk involved with this card. WotC has gotten a lot of flak about blue polymorph effects. Just changing destroy to exile is a step in the right direction and the potential for it to backfire in certain situations is inline with their new philosophy regarding removal. This is a great card for dealing with midrange yet those are also the decks most likely to benefit from a free manifest. ,spikes,cngp942,2,t5_2utkz

You have a serum visions and  other pieces of gas  you have plenty of stuff to do if delver dies.T serum visions seems to me like a much better play because you can set up delver to flip or dig for a land as appropriate.If one of the other  cards is a gitaxian probe that will get played first  of the time as you might expect.  If one of the other cards is a spell snare I might hold off on the T serum visions especially vs pod.I might choose to mulligan this hand if I dont have another  mana cantrip in the .

2940466,0,t3_2trxr6,So I am still building UB control and trying to figure out the lines of play and I am wondering about Ashiok as well.  My main question is this  Isnt turn  one of the worst turns to tap out?  Thats when you finally have Heros DownfallDissolve mana available and is probably your first play of the game and Ashiok doesnt do anything to the board for at least another turn.  Against tokens and control theres a very good chance your Ashiok doesnt hit anything for multiple turns. So I guess Im wondering Why is it worth tapping out on that key turn? A lot of people like Ashiok so Ill try to hazard some guesses.  Maybe turn  is a turn where almost no decks can produce  threats so worstcase scenario they just play a single big threat.  But if youre on the draw against an aggressive deck they can just choose to ignore Ashiok swing in and then play two twodrops.  But most of the time its probably just a single threat that gets played then on your next turn you can maybe get a body out of Ashiok if youre lucky and then sweepers make up the difference on turn .Do people side him out against aggressive decks?  Against aggressive decks with lots of twodrops when UB is on the draw?  ,spikes,co2cdts,2,t5_2utkz

2951231,0,t1_co3jeeg,I played the deck since week  up until the turn of the year and I have to say Jim Davis takes a loooooong time making decisions. Like absurdly long. He played a Temur list earlier in the first season and took  minutes making combat decisions. Not saying he isnt a good pilot but he really deliberates on everything and this contributes to him going to time or losing to the clock often. I know its not the same but Joe Lossett for example is also someone who deliberates a lot and a master of the control archetype and he plays incredibly quickly. Part of why I stopped playing the deck is I made the jumped to paper Modern but also because the decks gameplan is inferior to UB doubly so after FRF. End Hostilities and Elspeth were the primary draws to white over black but UB just durdles better. They get to be proactive in the beginning turns with discard setup mana for counter magic tapout to plop down the vault to keep the opponents from overextending all while they leisurely pick threats off one by one and bury you under card advantage. UW cant do that because UW really cant be as reactive and tapping out is quite dangerous in the deck.

As you point out there are other cards that Twin already mainboards that are good in Game Ones.

3305298,0,t3_2xsiwl,Its a little bit of both aggro and control.  I think the most accurate description was how TCGPlayer has termed it RW Tempo.It has all the early elements of RW aggro.  Wild Slash gives you early game tempo you can easily win games off goblin rabblemasters tempo and burn.  So people are calling it aggressive because it CAN win in the early game.I think Soulfire Grandmaster is a horrible early game card in comparison to Seeker of the Way.  It doesnt push damage Carytids basically always feel safe against it Coursers dont mind blocking it all day long.  Without Phoenix and Dragons MD to clear out the win midgame the game acts as a Jeskai Fireworks with all the burn to clean out some quick games.An interview with Ben Stark mentions that he really likes the end game the longer the game the better.  Thus people started calling it a control deck.Ive done a lot of play testing with the deck it has and explosive early game an okay mid game and a controlling end game with recycling burn spells.  Call it what you want from there I think RW Tempo fits best.Follow up Question  I cant pilot the deck very well Ive taken st with regular RW but lost horribly at FNM to RG monsters x Abzan Whip and Goblins RDW.  For me I dislike Soulfire early game dont think the control is strong enough late game without board wipes and the end game wincons are are too dependent on having a strong mainboard including Soulfire Creatures and Outpost Siege.  Original RW aggro is better because cards like Phoenix and Dragon dont depend on other cards and can sweep games without extra assistance.Not to say its not an awesome deck its just not my style.

I was skeptical about Zurgo at first but he seems like a real boon against the control matchup and maybe even certain aggro strategies.The only change I could see you making is putting the Thoughtseizes in the sideboard and putting more removal main like  more Chained and  more Heros Downfall.

For Murderous Cut you may delve  extra to pay the additional cost. Anger of the Gods wipes him away no problem. Rending Volley kills him for  uncounterable at instant speed. This guy matches up very poorly against  of the  tier  decks right now. RW offers very few good targets outside of Stormbreath Dragon and kills him with Chained to the Rocks or the abundant amount of cheap burn they run. GW offers very few good targets as Polukranos can still kill him and Whisperwood Elemental still makes manifests every turn. UBSultai control offers no targets period and kills him with either Bile BlightUltimate Price or board wipes him. He is much frailer than he appears and he has very little immediate impact especially for a  drop. How many  drops are you planning on running? Especially in Temur the new Sarkhan is almost always a better play. In UWJeskai the new Ojutai is easier to protect and gives you card advantage.

Ill try to comment on each of those main threats this deck offers you Fleemance Lion is an annoying guy especially after your opponent reaches that  mana borderline but drop a Doomwake Giant or Tasigur and block it for years also you could kill it with Bile Blight if you side that. Rakshasa Deathdealer becomes more a game of thought than a game of how to beat it. When this dude is on the field ALWAYS check how is your opponents mana distributed before you block also dont use removal unless your opponent lacks the mana. Hes quite annoying and Id rather have him removed before a siege rhino at least you can block Siege Rhino effectively Anafenza is a bitch and the worst threat your opponent has against you. Use any removal you can against her especially in early game because your opponent will drop her before you can drop an effective blocker like Tasigur or Doomwake.

That sort of versatility for one mana is pretty good and I am perfectly fine with countering their Heros Downfall and scryingI dont really think of my token producers as well...token producers. They serve as a burn spell when Im being aggressive and a fog spell when Im not.

Burn to the face is nice the bounce to the top of opponents deck is so temporary very bad especially when youre up against cards like Siege Rhino and haste creatures aka Stormbreath Dragon.  It really shined in token decks or decks that carried Rabblemaster.  The  lifelink is where its at.  Not sure if it fits in your deck or mine.As far as moving forward goes Narset Transcendent probably goes well as a of.  Its awesome but really slow as a win condition I think.  Not as crazy effective as a Sarkhan  haste or a Elspeth dropping s every turn.  Then again I could be wrong.I think Ojutais Command will be awesome  as a  of.  Amazing card but we still have to keep in mind how well it curves into the rest of the deck.  It stalls for a bit but wont stave off an entire turn like Cryptical command does.Myth Realized definitely intrigues me.  Its an amazing offensive card but i think will get shut off easily G and G with enchantment hate.  Not to mention it doesnt carry the wonderful lifegain abilities that Seeker of the Way and Soul Fire Grandmaster carry.Anticipate will definitely be a test run in the Steam Augury position of my deck.  Not as clearly defining as drawing  cards but that early game deck stacking is a huge hole Ive been trying to fill in my deck.Radiant Purge will be SB at best.  I still think Glare of Heresy has much better position in the meta so Radiant Purge will more than likely not make my cut.  Glare attacks Rhinos Elspeth Planeswalkers that white Siege hell a lot of creatures and Jeskai Ascendancy.  Radiant Purge being an instant is absolutely awesome  so it basically becomes a meta call at that point depending on what your local area is like.,spikes,cphiegs,1,t5_2utkz

3423834,0,t3_2zcetr,Hitting UU and RR by turn three for both Anger and Dissolve sounds like a particularly greedy manabase. Its also questionable that you only have  Bivouac but  temples mana stability is more important than an extra scry.I think the SB Rending Volleys should be Plummets Volley doesnt kill Stormbreath Dragons and Roast is there to kill anything on the ground. Volley may help deal with Brimaz but other problem UW ground pounders die to Lightning Strikes and Angers. Likewise I feel Craters Claws doesnt belong unless youre really worried about killing planeswalkers.On the subject of SBD and creatures in general  SBD could make sense as a mainboard card and is definitely a sensible sideboard option. PLA I feel just doesnt belong. Savage Knuckleblade functions just as well as a  mana control win con and doesnt require you pick up lands to protect it.

At worst its skullcrack  and with one or more creatures out the final mode is very relevant as well. The other commands could see play but this is the one with a n archetype that definitely wants it.Dragonlord Ojutai  I have a friend whos an Esper control player and interestingly hes most excited about this card as a finisher. He is also excited about Ojutais command as a budget cryptic replacement but thinks Narset Transcendent is not great in his deck. If youre looking for a modern sleeper this might be it.Narset Transcendent  on the other hand I have a friend who plays Jeskai control and Narset could be a better fit for him if only because giving a burn spell rebound is better than what the esper player would do with it.Roast  its more expensive than flame slash but kills rhinos and Tasigur. Twin decks might want it.The uncommon color hosers especially Rending Volley  all of these could be efficient sideboard cards. Rending Volley especially shines as a twin hoser while also hitting Restoration Angel and Collonades.Anticipate  could be better than Telling Time for decks that want a lot of filtering.

These arguments are beaten to death on the Internet already though. If they wanted to ban goyf they would have already.Most of the banned list is to force out legacy creature decks from the format so that they look distinct. If they unbanned zenith maverick would be legal. If they unbanned stoneforge stoneblade would be. They kept nacatl out so people wouldnt just play legacy zoo.

When you get the full lock in place and your opponent cant do anything you dont want to lose to a top deckd Decay or something. Or its just  dmg to close out a game. Path doesnt work in a deck relying on Blood Moons as part of the lock. Ive tried both Elspeth KnightErrant and Elspeth Suns Champion and prefer Koth. Its my first time playing him so its not like hes some pet card Koth is the real deal in this deck especially when you have Blood Moon in play. Often times you just quickly ult him then slowly kill your opponent with the emblemd up mountains while they cant attack you. EDIT Forgot about the Timely comment.

3602627,0,t1_cq2wl3f,Thanks for the critique! I understand Mentor generates a lot of value in prowess matters shells like this however I feel that this card does not play as well from behind compared to Brimaz. My gut feeling is that Mentors power level does not translate as well from Modern into Standard simply because of the lack of good cheap noncreature spells in the format.However of the  or so games Ive played with this list I do feel like Brimaz was not helping in the matches I was losing so maybe having Mentor maindeck and moving Brimaz to the sideboard will leverage favourable matchups more. Ill definitely try this out and keep this thread updated with my findings.In regards to Myth Realized I agree it is very powerful at the moment. Growing the enchantment while playing other threats forces the opponent into the awkward position of tapping out to answer other threats or hold mana open to kill Myth Realized after animating it.However I do feel this card sets a lot of deck building restrictions definitely a build around me card  any standard deck that revolves around this card does not have a big pool of viable noncreature spells to work with.

Dragon Fodder benefits more from masspump effects like Atarkas Command and Hall of Triumph. Mardu Scout dodges sorcery speed removal like Scouring Sands Arc Lightning and Anger of the Gods. Mardu Scout also trades with  tokens so in a head to head matchup Dragon Fodder seems better.Im still not sure which one is better in general.

4021783,0,t1_crek5x5,I agree with your assessment and I think its definitely true but when its come to actually playing the matchup it seems to play out a little differently.Grixis Delver has been much better at the tempo game because it has actual reach to it now with the black delver threats and kill spells. It has a lot of good momentum.Ive played against it from the JundJunk side and maybe if my friend uAcademyRuins sees this he can chime in from his side in playing Grixis Delver.When I play the matchup as Junk I dread it. Game  the earliest interaction we have is Abrupt Decay to clear the board and Pathing is miserable because they quickly make use of the extra mana by playing bigger threats and leaving up counters. They quickly get a board presence because Junk doesnt have the cheap profitable interaction that Jund does. Them buying back creatures in the late game usually doesnt matter with an active Liliana and a board presence that they now lack.Jund just has bolt thats all I want in the matchup. I dont let them build their tempo or gain their momentum. I can quickly clear their board and stabilize. Then after board its harder to lose to Blood Moon we play red. ,spikes,creppfh,1,t5_2utkz

And even if they do have two more elves to play the next turn it is better to wait and see what they are so you can properly prioritize your removal. Also waiting to cast it until their third elf is on the stack can screw up their plans for the turn and or coming turns where as pathing during upkeep allows them to adjust accordingly and make the most optimal line of play knowing that the druid wont be there.

4154681,0,t3_38932b,I like it. I played a Temur Dragons a few weeks back and had a blast with it.I dont like Elvish Mystic in TemurId just much rather have Sylvan Caraytid. The only advantage of Mystic is that it can get you to three mana on turn  but the main drop you actually care about is Knuckleblade and Mystic doesnt help you cast it unless your lands are perfect you need turn  Yavimaya Coast and turn  Mountain or Wooded Foothills. Thats asking a lot especially with only  Coasts. Caryatid means Knuck comes down a turn later but because Carytid can produce red he often gets haste which is almost as good as a turn  Knuck anyway. Plus Elvish Mystic is just horrible against pretty much all aggro decks where Caryatid actually has value against some of them. Now admittedly I wasnt playing Deathmist and so maybe that makes the Elvish Mystics less bad but I just like Caryatid better in concept. Id run  Caryatid and  Rattleclaws over the  Mystic Rattleclaw split or  Carytid Rattleclaws if you really want to be the aggressor but worse against aggro.Id also run  Stubborn Denial main.

4247614,0,t1_cs4dfb7,One thing that Ive found to be very helpful is to make my own sideboarding guide. Even if a pro writes a guide for your exact  make sure that you understand and agree with every change unless youre playtesting in which case I recommend that you test the exact configurations that the pros recommend if you dont come up with an alternative board plan for that matchup. You dont even necessarily need to say RDW Add x Duress x Drown x Ultimate Price Drop x Abzan Charm x Thoughtseize x Downfall x Mana Confluence for every matchup but rather you need to understand when a card is good and when its bad. So every card in your sideboard and cards in your mainboard that sometimes come out should have an entry indicating when you should bring it in when you should bring it out and what other things might impact your decision to do that.Wingmate Roc is a good example. When is it bad? Well its pretty weak against Stormbreath Dragon decks. Against them youd much rather have a threat like Elspeth. Its weak against certain varieties of control decks but its still at threat so you dont want to drop it against UB Control or Esper Control until youve dropped worse cards. Its great against Green Devotion but if they play a lot of copies of Arbor Colossus its worse. Also note that if you side out both copies of Wingmate Roc and dont bring in Elspeth you can drop a white mana source probably a Plains.Against RDW I drop down to  copies of Thoughtseize and bring in both copies of Duress. Thoughtseize still does some work particularly against things like Goblin Heelcutter but Ultimate Price kills him too. Against Ux Control decks I bring in as much hand disruption as I can and I try to use it to force threats through. We really want to draw at least  discard spells against Esper Dragons one of them early so that we can keep our guys alive or cast them and one on turn  after we have Anafenza on board so that we can take their dragon. Against more pure control decks a single welltimed discard spell can be the difference between a win and a loss particularly if the card you take is a Dig or a Perilous Vault. Against Abzan Control I dont like Duress as much as Thoughtseize but I still sometimes bring in one.I like running  lands but when I do I often side down to . The reason to run  instead of  is because of how mana hungry your deck is. My deck is even more mana hungry because Im running  copies of Herald of Torment but you have mana sinks in Warden Deathdealer and Fleecemane Lion.Heres another article about the mindset involved in choosing which card to take when playing Thoughtseize. And another about when to play it I found those while trying to find another article about when its appropriate to play against your opponents gameplan and when its appropriate to play against their hand. It was a useful article that talks about how sometimes when you Thoughtseize them you want to throw off their plan other times its going to be more effective for you to make their hand less effective against you right now.EDIT These two SCG Premium articles are pretty useful  ,spikes,cs4f2r8,2,t5_2utkz

I dont think most players mull to the better removal they may mull to the turn two plays and wraths but good players probably dont toss serviceable s for the chance at specific hate in the . With that assumption days undoing looks like it really might be drawing your opponent into hate you just cant deal with. In terms of drawing them into better removal if this card starts seeing widespread play people will just use that removal as quickly as possible. Best case scenario then involves what emptying a graveyard to shuffle an ancient grudge back in giving them another shot at it? Thats pretty bad.In terms of the two mana hate cards you would seem to have it even worse. Unless youre on the play and dumping as much of your hand t as you can get then dropping days undoing despite whatever is left your opponent will have either played the hate turn  or not had it. If they played it days almost certainly doesnt help if they didnt youve just tossed them a fresh seven to try to find it.The one place where i think days could easily be a wash is against the wrath effects. you can reasonably play this card before they could play them but even then its neutral for giving them hate while refilling them on targeted removal.,spikes,csux6m3,2,t5_2utkz

It has strong matchups vs a lot of the field most aggro Affinity Tron and especially Twin. But two of its worst matchups are Burn and GBx both of which are very prevalent right now. You can certainly roll with it in any given tournament and feel comfortable but when Im facing down Jund in the top  I just get a sinking feeling in my heart.About a month ago I decided to make the switch to Grishoalbrand already owned the Goryos Grisels and Breaches so financially it wasnt too bad. The deck has less bad matchups but rather more inconsistency across all matchups.

The way the decks play are very different and both have their strengths and weaknesses but theyre both pretty successful.

Additionally the deck doesnt play  Deathmist Raptors so it can afford to play some  drops like Nissa.Ive played Abzan Megamorph a few times and it wasnt really my cup of tea not that it isnt a great deck though.

4646246,0,t3_3em21i,Slightly Johnny is a fairly large understatement which is why youre being downvoted. This is a deck that cares more about a cute interaction than winning and unless it proved to be quite broken I dont think a spike would seriously consider playing it in a competitive setting. You havent provided any testing evidence to suggest that it actually has legs and at face value it looks very inconsistent.So you have a  card combo that deals  damage on turn  at the earliest and requires that you untap with an artifact and a creature in play and get to attack with the creature. Thats extremely fragile.First question  why arent you running blue as well so that you have better card selection Dig Through Time and Anticipate and can protect your combo Negate Swan Song?Second question  how do you beat counterspells?Third question  how do you beat aggressive decks that kill you before you combo? I would probably include GR Devotion in this category as most of your spells do little against them and they will kill you that quickly.I can see this being good against Abzan ControlMidrange as they dont have good interaction and are unlikely to kill you before you can assemble the combo. That said you do have to assemble the combo which youre not going to do every game and I dont think you beat them if you dont.In my opinion you would be better off cutting some or all of the Howls adding blue and going for a deck that uses Goggles for value copying Dig Through Time is pure gas controls the board with burn and eventually kills the opponent with burn andor creatures like Abbott which also generate value. Swiftspear doesnt really fit as its too aggressive And Id also look at cards like Chandra Keranos and maybe Ashcloud Phoenix as hard to deal with threats.,spikes,ctg81yw,7,t5_2utkz

4847919,0,t1_cu48mjx,Ive been playing Yisan for months and months now. At one point it felt very powerful. It crushed green devotion and the plague of slow creature heavy Abzan decks with the ability to build boards like no other. Even now having the powerful value engine of Yisan backed by counter spells can be pretty effective against many slower decks like GR devotion or even Esper Dragon Control. But it loses too hard to the mana powerful aggro decks in the format Nyleas Disciple notwithstanding. That said the deck is a great exercise of your Magic skills and is something that I can almost guarantee will lead to great stories. I encourage you to at least give it a shot.Heres my list I cant claim to be a great Magic player but here are my tips for you. Play Soul of New Phyrexia. This card is everything the deck wants a big beater board wipe and removal protection as well as a win condition. Most of my nonscoop wins come from swinging with an indestructible board state once or twice. . The gods are bad. Thassa has some nice late game utility but youre already really really hard pressed to stabilize into the late game and you really cant afford to play something that doesnt affect the board at all.. Youre soft as putty to fliers. I have  Arbor Colossi and  Soul of Ravnica and Im still considering upping the count of Colossi. Im even considering replacing Whisperwood as I feel its one of the weakest cards in the deck right now.,spikes,cu5m7bh,2,t5_2utkz

Signing a match slip with a false match score on it should be where the line is drawn between a DQ and a verbal caution IMO.

First off I like to run  of the temples and  of the pain lands I dont find myself needing to have an untapped land as much since we are playing more reactively than proactively like UB control.Otherwise it looks like you took the list from the Pro Tour. Im also running this list but I subbed out the third elspeth for another den protector. I may revert that switch however is abzan aggro continues to explode. Sideboard.I dont think arashin clerics are necessary in control. Id prefer to run  one copy of pharikas cure. The only case I could see arashin cleric coming into my sideboard is if my meta game was  burn and even then you have dromokas commands to help you deal with burn. Anafenza is a fine  of but I prefer a third fleecemane. Our deck is extremely  drop heavy and when we are playing match ups that we want to get faster we are better off bolstering our nearly nonexistant drop slot.I give you props for switching out the hostility for tragic arrogance. I think it works so much better in our deck. The reclamation sages seem redundant to me. If you are that desperate for enchantment removal go up to  dromokas commands we arent looking for creatures like other decks and dromokas command offers more utility. I run  dromokas commands and a back to nature since there are a couple of constellation decks running around in my meta and if youre worried about the artifact decks going around throw in an unravel the aether and dont worry so much because I think we have a pretty good match up against with. Abzan charm gets us out of a lot of sticky situations against scissors. cards I would consider for your sideboard are a nd tasigur and an utter endTasigur is great in the grindy match ups and also gives you another creature on board vs control at the same time.Utter end gives you an answer for anything. Its a great one of to make sure youre never screwed. Im even considering moving it to my main board in place of an ultimate price to give me an answer to tutelage game one. Hope I could help.

5013159,0,t1_cupvn9p,Yea that is true but that is based on some assumptions of what cards they have and what time you have the Nacatl. Ill try and paint you a picture back and the one i thought of.  Imagine you are on the play and turn  Nacatl their only removal is pyroclasm which is usually fast enough and disruptive enough but with nacatl you will get a hit in T and T for a total of  dmg with no chance of getting it removel though it can get blocked if they have a skite and decides to block it and now you are in a situation where just  card dealt  dmg and forced an answer maybe karn and therefore saved another creatureland. All in all i think its way too draw dependant and not something you can discuss without testing as the nacatls preformance can seem very lobsided in theory all in all though why even care? The GR matchup is great and you DONT need to add additional cards to the deck to make it better you need to add stuff this instance the nacatl to shore up worse matchups ,spikes,cuq9wx3,1,t5_2utkz

Also trample it gives is becomes extremely relevant against aggromidrange decks and uncounterable becomes relevant for blue based control decks.

Anyways if were going all in on the  color ugins insight with ugin sarkhan obnix tasigur ojutai etc.... on the field ojutai tragic arroganceend hostilitiescrux all seem like great tutor targets.  I like to imagine the deck will play Sarkhan unbroken for color fixing and extra manacards.  I think double white and double black would be tough to guarentee so languish is potentially sketchy.  That means you ought to be running as much as x radiant flames and potentially a similar tutorable affect like seismic rupture.  As far as im concerned the deck should probably just be  colors with  colors of mana for bring to light.  Youre probably priced into blue and red maybe green and then black or white.I think a spicy  of against control decks would be surrak dragonclaw.

Other cool guys include disciple of the ring ojutai clever impersonator dlord slumlord flip walkers maybe noyan dar against control?

Not to mention the  they get can easily be killed by Languish or any other burn spell in the format.

I can see how certain aspects of it can be extremely helpful.  Replays virtually endless amounts of people to play with daily events ect...  Mainly my beef is with MTGO not playing Magic online. There are far better programs to use that are FREE and are not terribly executed and a piss poor excuse to generate a little extra revenue from players that already spend too much to play the game anyways. Sorry for the rant. This isnt the proper venue to bitch about MTGO. gt Try to be at least a passable deckbuilder thats a necessary skill...I couldnt agree more with this! The shear amount of people that simply can not build a deck is too damn high. I feel as though we as a group of Magic players rely too heavily on Pros and those who write columns to tell us what to play and how to play. I think we forget that we are capable of thinking for our selves and trying things out. Dont get me wrong I think its important to research and learn about whats going on in the Magic community.

The player put his hand on the table because he misunderstood OPs intentions which is fine and happens. However OP knew exactly why his opponent had revealed his hand. By allowing his opponent to keep his hand revealed while he wrote down the cards he was implying that the Clique trigger was resolving exactly how the opponent thought. There is absolutely no possible way OP thought his opponent was just revealing his hand for no reason.Unfortunately there is room for abuse here. One could easily cast clique and allow the opponent to reveal his hand then see if there is anything worth taking with the trigger then upon seeing the hand is junk say they were going to target themselves and draw a free card while getting rid of sunsetting they now know they dont need.  ,spikes,cw8kec6,2,t5_2utkz

5619976,0,t3_3rydfh,Last Friday I went  at my FNM using abzan control. I built this deck to counter the meta of single colored creature aggro decks like BW aristocrats and RG aggro. There two control decks such as esper demonic pact and c bring to light but I didnt get to face them so I dont really know how the match up against blue control decks work. I dont know how well this deck will preform against other abzan decks decks with a lot of planeswalker since the meta at my store there isnt a lot of Gideon around decks with a lot of tokens and ramp decks since this deck can do every well against aggro decks.Creatures x Siege Rhinosx Catacomb Sifterx Hangarback Walkerx Greenwarden of Murasa x Tasigur the Golden Fangx Den protectorSpellsx Abzan Charmx Painful Truthsx Ultimate Pricex Ob Nixilis Reignitedx Ugin the Spirit Dragonx Murderous Cut x Dromokas Command x Silkwrapx Gideons Reproachx Languish x Utter End Landsx Windswept Heath x Shambling Ventx Bloodstained Mirex Wooded Foothills x Flooded Strand x Canopy vistax Cinder Cladex Smoldering Marsh x Sunken Hollow x Llanowar Wastes x Plains x Swamps x Forests Sideboard x Tainted Remedy x Virulent Plague x Duress x Transgress the Mind x SelfInflicted Woundx Surge of Righteousness x Arashin Cleric  Match The first game I faced against a monoblack ingest aggro deck. Which was one of my fears since ultimate price is basically a dead card. So out went ultimate price and in went Arashin Clerics. My goal in this game was to kill his early threats with gideons reapproach silk wraps abzan charms and then try to play into my catacomb shifter and rhinos.Match Here I faced an black white warrior deck with a splash of green so he could use abzan charm and abzan ascendancy. Not sure why he splashed green but I only saw one use of abzan charm to exile my rhino. But same strategy kill his early threats and gain card advantage using siege rhino and arashin clerics to heal and den protectors to gain rhinos and removal back. The one issue I faced was when my opponent played Gideon and Sorin. But thank god for utter end. Match Once again another aggro deck mardu aristocrats. Running with Drana butchers blood soaked champ and zulaports. So once again removed the BS champs with silkwraps Gideon reproach and abzan charm any multi colored minions and killed every zulaport as soon as it was played. Match Faced against a redgreen landfall deck. My opponent had Sarkhan which provided to be the worst threat in his deck. But thats only if he played it. Otherwise removed every minion that came into play so he couldnt combo us with temur battle rage and become immense. As far as I know my opponent didnt run any hordeling outburst and dragon fodder which worked for me. ,spikes,cwtpn4i,3,t5_2utkz

5670586,0,t1_cwzyxln,I think Storm is at a weird power level either its high above having tremendous combination turns or quite low because a hand full of Faithless Looting like you see in some builds or Sleights just doesnt quite get the job done and you take quite a bit of damage with fetchdual lands  probes which can be unusually taxing in Modern right now.   Make no mistake whether or not Storm is represented in your metagame or one youve studied might not impact on the power of the deck. It is ridiculous engine its unfair its fast and its not that straightforward but it definitely can be measured and tested. What Im hoping to do and what Im writing about is that Im simply playing a different flavor of this style of deck and having some pretty great results at the moment.    My experience with deck may very well lead me to some generalizations that people who arent used to storming arent used to. Sorry but I thank you for reading. I would certainly say that luck has to do with this deck. You generally need an uncommon amount of luck to do anything positive with Storm but if you dont know what youre doing what you need is basically a redoubling of that amount of luck. And its hard and not every hand of Rituals and Grapeshot is an instakill. This deck is uncommon as well in its speed sequencing and choices and the amount of steering you can do with the deck well its kind of hard to go with words but I hope some of the examples can highlight these interactions especially if youre not the kind who plays with it a lot.  I just think Storm could use a bit of innovation outside of shifting around  cards in the sideboard and playing  of the same ones it has been for a long time. Thanks   ,spikes,cwzzq7s,-8,t5_2utkz

Maybe youre right that gifts gt BTL but it certainly goes better in a value shell with lots of options. The draft Im playing right now has some truly disgusting gifts piles even if Im casting gifts less often. Gifts for x fatties and unburial rites is just lights out against Jund. I think ultimately it depends on a balance between value gifts and tempo BTL. If you have cards that win you the game on the spot the BTL is better. But if you need to grind your opponent out AND have time to do so gifts is better. Regardless I think what you say is true that  of modern decks lose on the spot to unburial gt ionanorn. But a lot of these decks can be soft locked with some other card almost as reliably. If you just control the game against aggro then sneezing on them can be just as good as iona. ,spikes,cxss3rp,1,t5_2utkz

And while I agree that silkwrap is better for nabbing small creatures and hangarback it also cant be flashed back with Jace and most Jace decks arent looking to run valorous stance anyway as theyre more control or planeswalker oriented.

I do think that this will be powerful standard card pretty much the rest of the time as both the body and effect are relavent and reasonably costed and its very vesatile as an agressive card. In standard I would expect this to see play in an aggressive BRC devoid deck likely in tandem with forerunner of slaughter and eldrazi obligator with ghostfire blade. Though Im uncertain that that particular deck will be good when you can easily run so many colours and grindy versatile value cards Bearer of silence should go a long way towards it. The deck may not be playable until post rotation though when the mana gets worse.

6191128,0,t3_40aau7,The mana in this deck is almost surely wrong.  You have  Silumgars Scorn alongside  Oath of Nissa.  There is no world where you can curve T Oath of Nissa into Silumgars Scorn.  That means youre never going to curve out in the deck and your only real action in the entire list is on T.  This is a pretty big issue and it makes me question the viability of Oath of Nissa in what is a mediocre control list with too many nonsynergistic threats slapped in.  In three color decks T spells that have a double symbol are harder to cast than a spell that has three different symbols.  You have to curve out perfectly just to make it work at all.  Analyzing the likelihood of curving out into Nissa Voice of Zendikar with any reasonable opening is certainly Forest Island hope you drew one of your  Windswept Heath.  Or take T off by playing one of your six manlands six!? T play one of your  effective islandsfetches into Silumgars Scorn hope youre holding a of Dragon and then T play basic forest or your  Windswept Heath.  Your ideal situation is that you play T or T Oath of Nissa taking one of these two turns off because you cant cast any of your interaction before  unless you skip the Oath and then put a  into play on T.  Really the most likely outcome is that you play T tapland T tapland T  for GG.  That deck cannot possibly win in any environment other than Limited and even then youre probably going to lose.Not to mention that youre playing  Gideon with  white sources   Oath of Nissa.  That is almost certainly wrong even with a ton of white sources in Abzan and  lands vs  lands it is the hardest spell to cast in the deck.Your curve is waaay too high and youre not running any ramp  not to mention  lands.  You arent running any way to clog up the ground and you are running far too few ways to interact with creatures an opponent might land.  Im counting  kill spells and  Crux of Fate.  I dont know how youre living to untap with any of these walkers.  Youre also running very lowimpact walkers.  Nissa and Gideon kind of interact but only favorably by turn  which you will be dead by.  Youre also running  ways to draw spells  DTT Painful Truths but in a list where you opt for such a high curve this is unnecessary.  You either choose card advantage or card quality both is a deck that is too slow which is the case here.  Youre going to draw into a pawful of cards that you still have to cast perturn and cannot exist in multiples.  This cannot reasonably work.As a control deck you cant beat decks with just of Silumgars Scorn.  It just wont work.  Abzan and Atarka will both get a threat in underneath the Scorn for sure the ramp decks will not care if you counter their Ulamog when they wipe you out with the oncast trigger and almost everything else will have too many threats or a turn where they cast two threats.  Your clock isnt good enough to beat anything else I havent mentioned.Sorry to be super harsh this is just a competitive forum and your list is very clearly untested and bad even by kitchen table standards.

Not having to continually sink a lot of money into decks was on of the selling points of modern. gtand youre not going to spend more on new decks because of it because all the money you had spared for this game would have gone to other formats or accessories anyway.That is not at all how I budget my magic expenditure.

Name a deck in standard that doesnt run removal spells. They are already planning on killing your creatures why make it a better deal for them?

6350581,0,t3_42lnal,I dont know why people are upvoting Palace Familiar. As a Rally player Elvish Visionary is crucial in this deck because you run a tight mana base that needs to hit land drops early  Elvish Visionary helps accomplish that. It also is an ETB trigger not when it dies trigger  weve seen in coverage how crucial Scion tokens can be to get scry triggers when were trying to fight past an Ananfenza and now Kalitas. Visionary also doesnt require another enabler to get value from it curiously I think Palace Familiar is also worse than Elvish Visionary because its harder to bin. The evasion of Palace Familiar means its less easily blocked which is sometimes what you want to happen to your Elvish Visionaries because Rally for value is a thing that happens and you sometimes need to do to get some velocity going in your deck. The advantage of Palace Familiar is that it puts your mana base firmly in Esper territory splashing green for Collected Company. That is a distinct and important thing.

Its far preferable to a world where we all jam azure drake just because it says draw a card. gtOnce someone takes board control its almost impossible to break free especially given that the game lacks very good boardclear.Yeah but everything you do in hearthstone is about fighting for the board. Even control decks drop bigbutt minions early. And sorry but there are good board clears in lightbomb brawl etc. Theyre just not unconditional like in MTG.gtThats why cards like Reno Jackson are so good he provides a lackluster body but sets your opponent back several turns of attackingI dont understand how can square this with your vision of hearthstone as a board control oriented game with lousy comeback mechanisms. Since Reno lets you lose the board but make comebacks later...gtwhy bother playing value cards when you can just swarm the board and know that your shredder will drop another attacker next turn?Plenty of decks dont play Shredder. In fact Id argue that shredder is pretty bad as a neutral minion and only sees play in decks specifically interested in sticky minions visavis intrinsically useful minions. gt Its not conducive to a competitive game that your shredder can drop a milllhouse one game and a doomsayer the next. Its not conducive to a competitive game that jugglerimplosion can fail to kill a mechanical yeti and summon two imps or kill a blastmage with  damage juggle down a snowchugger and summon  s.Yeah Ive definitely had games come down to a coinflip. But theres a lot you can do to mitigate the RNG. For example giving yourself contingency plans if your implosion rolls a  instead of a . Thats one of the ways to get an edge in the game.gtwhich is often pretty simple how many times does midrange hunter have to make a hard choice?Well if its classic midrange you need to strike a balance between going for the board and going for face. You cant just go monoface and expect to win just because hunter hurp durp. Im not even saying all hearthstone decks are super deep but if you want to play competitively in a multideck format like conquest youre going to have to pick up something that is extremely challenging compared to check out my creatures  removal  card advantage that is every single standard deck atm. gtNow that doesnt mean you cant have skill in hearthstone but it does mean that highlevel games are often decided by what a boom bot kills. Thats funny and interesting but its not good for a competitive game.In hearthstone players regularly achieve legend every season. They also sometimes boast  win rates while they climb to the top levels of legend. You could never achieve this feat in MTG because the best players have a  MWP against random shitters at GPs let alone in any kind of elo rating system where they are matched against other successful players. ,spikes,czwxjn8,1,t5_2utkz

The ideal start for your lands in this deck is canopy vistagtislandgtmountain as this lets you cast every  mana spell in the deck. The fourth land should be a cinder glade so that you can haste knucks and cast dromokas command.  My list did play man lands which was one of the issues you had with the mana in the deck. I played  lumbering falls and  wandering fumarole.Savage Knucks in grindy matchups he fills the same shoes as mantis rider does in matchups that lead to a ground stall. Its a hasty threat that is undercosted and gives you plenty of great options in the late game to protect him making him quite hard to deal with. He is unimpressive in creature matchups but in control matchups he is the best reason to be playing red.My list also plays yasova dragonclaw which is a HOUSE in the mirror but unimpressive elsewhere and so Im moving her to the board but thinking of adding a second copy.The other card of note I played was jeskai charm which is just absurd in this deck.

6909526,0,t3_4adu3u,I honestly dont see this as particularly playable.Basically outside of a dedicated ramp deck  mana is a lot more than  mana.  Usually that means that you arent going to be able to drop this until turn  at the earliest.  If you are relying on this to clear a board you are probably already going to be dead by the time you can cast it.  If you are clearing the board long enough for this to be relevant you are going to be casting this to kill  maaaybe  other creatures.  If you can hit more creatures than that Im wondering how you survived long enough against them.  At least with planar outburst you can play it on turn  to clear the board even without awakening it and then flash it back later with jace for its awakened cost once you can afford to.I would expect this card to hit the bulk bins and if it gets played it gets played as no more than a  of out of the sideboard.  ,spikes,d0zijp2,4,t5_2utkz

6959915,0,t1_d14st0j,All Im reading into with this BR deck is that if it stumbles on mana ever its just dead. It wants to constantly tap out for threats while simultaneously leaving open mana for madness. Thats just a fools gambit. There is always a time when you will be vulnerable and when you are you give them the opportunity to just destroy the entire core of your deck with any real resistance. It seems far easier to stabilize against this aggro deck in theory than any aggro deck in the past year.The fact is that you cant just trigger madness whenever you want. If you are then you arent casting anything on your turns and arent really applying the pressure the aggro deck needs to.Radiant Flames is going to become even more amazing and crucial to the meta if this deck somehow has the correct pieces in place at the correct times enough to be a force. You get enough cards to be great in a vacuum and good when you can get the synergy to work. But if you dont have that synergy online then you dont have a deck.

7009303,0,t1_d1au3qc,Ive been toying with various GR Ramp builds since Oath became legal. I tried the Ruin in Their Wake build with Wastes and my previous iteration ran the Elvish Visionary package you have. In practice I found that they were helpful in digging but didnt actually DO much of anything besides chump block once. They didnt offer much in the way of the actual game plan they were just there to cycle and to maybe soak up an attack. In contrast I think the Offshoots do this much more effectively. They can buffer you against early gas like Swiftspears and goblin tokens and can blunt some pretty explosive starts by giving you a few bonus life points. You are going to be ramping like crazy anyway so getting to see  life or so can put you out of range of a lot of the aggro decks and give you time to stabilize against midrange. The Advocates have always been pretty solid in my experience theyre a very good drop in a deck that doesnt have hardly any and theyre often  Vigilance and attacking by turn . Thats not something most decks can ignore for long so he often eats a removal spell that might otherwise have been held back for World Breaker or Atarka. I can see Hangarback being a viable alternative to him that scales well moving into the late game and youll often be able to hard cast it for X before too long. I just have a decent amount of Bant CoCo around here and Reflector Mage makes Hangarback look pretty bad.

Lets ask three questions.Q . How does the deck look against ramp?A . Terrible. The deck puts some things on the board that dont  kill quickly. They kind of get big a little bit eventually. None of them can ever attack into a World Breaker and a DL Atarka cleanly answers everything we worked for. We also do nothing that prevents the ramp player from playing their spells on T. In this matchup we are essentially a proactive deck that is doing lesspowerful things than our proactive opponent. We will lose almost every game.Q . How does the deck look against Collected Company?A . Terrible to Okay. Deathmist Raptor clogging up the board isnt as huge of a deal because we will sometimes be able to sequence in such a way that we build power first strikers. Additionally Archangel of Tithes is a reasonable answer to a clogged ground board. However playing a bunch of ground guys and hoping they win combat will probably be done better by a Den ProtectorDeathmist Raptor shell. I feel like we should just be playing Raptor and D Command if we want to make big ground guys. And why arent we playing Gideon? That would help a little.Q . How does the deck look against aggressive things with Atarkas Command?A . Okay. power first strike demands combat tricks very early which makes it awkward for them to push damage through. There is not much lifegain but Archangel of Tithes is okay here too. Our deck is pretty bad against Shock though so I definitely wouldnt rate this as good.

7158596,0,t1_d1ru0yw,This is where i thought you were going to go with it and I dont believe this to be true. Delver is a successful strategy because it applies early pressure if unanswered.  Damage on turn  from a flying Flipped delver is what tempo wants to do and if it eats a path or a bolt that is much better than waiting till turn  or so to put a threat down like delver or drawing  on turn .Grixis Delver also has a want to put out a large threat quickly against the decks without early large creature answers such as JundYes Terminate is a thing but Abrupt decay and bolt dont hit it TronOstone is a turn  play and a turn  answer at best combo decksOmnarscience Storm and fast small creature strategiesBoggles MeliraSoul sisters. In order to achieve this you need things to go to your yard early. a turn  tasigur or Angler isnt unheard of and in certain situations secures the win earlier than expected. Thoughtscour or Serum visions are the likely replacements and it seems as if they are better suited for the delve strategy than AV is. Cruise was another animal in the sense that it was immediately impacting your hand and also eat away at the resource you were building for tasigur and co anyway.Tron is a hard matchup for  reasons they have sweepers and they have inevitability. Visions helps refill our hand but Delver actually keeps the pressure on for Tron decks making them dig for that Ostone or hope for that Pyroclasm. Visions seems to be a little too late to go off for an aggressive tempo deck like delver. Delver is not a finisher. Delver late game is a dead draw and so is Visions. Hitting one of those  cards in a late game top decking situation is terrible that is even one of the reasons why the deck only runs  lands. It also has  interaction with Snapcaster which leads it to being much worse than serum visions.Im not saying Grixis control doesnt want it im not even saying UR delver doesnt want thisalthough for the same tempo reasons AV is a worse Turn  than Delver but with the constraints of Grixis Delver it seems nonoptimal.,spikes,d1rv2q2,1,t5_2utkz

Theres a lot of redundancy and several cards are interchangeable. Look at some of the recent events on starcitygames.com to get an idea of what to shoot for but you might have trouble getting all the rares right now if youre not ready to just purchase them outright at an inflated cost. Preordering and speculation is really the only way to play competitive standard without dropping  every rotation unfortunately.Get your playset of Consuls LT the uncommon white  drops Thalias and White Orchid should be affordable you already have Always Watching. If you dont have Declaration in Stone you can use SilkwrapStasis SnareSuspension Field. If you dont want to drop  on Angels alone pick a color to splash. Blue is pretty good and reflector Mage is an uncommon but might not have the power to close out games if youre not running an optimized creature list. Green is probably just as expensive as mono white if not moreso and is pretty bad though GW tokens is a real deck. Red is cheap it can use more uncommons than the rest and has cheaper lands but is heavily reliant on Kytheon and hes  right now. Theyre all at least moderately competitive and if you build the white part first you can switch to whatever second color you want and have a pretty solid deck for quite a while.

7626150,0,t3_4jr010,Ive been testing and working with various Black White builds since the beginning of this new standard and I agree with most of what has already been said.  Not enough sources for Eldrazi Displacer  With all the great removal these days you kind of have to think of him as a six drop.  Even then you will probably have more games than you want where you just play him as a  and he immediately dies.  Same thing for thought knot.  Ideally you want to play him on turn four or power him out with ramp and get ahead of your opponent.  With only two colorless sources he is going to be a dead card way too often.If you have a fast meta I can see where Read the Bones might not be ideal.  In my games of control vs. things like Mono White Humans they usually have me down to single digits and I didnt feel like I could Read the bones.  Overall though it was great after I had stabalized.  One I had gotten some life back through Shambling Vents or Sorin it really put me ahead to be able to refill my hand.  Ive started mainboarding Hallowed Moonlight.  Between Collected Company and Secure the Wastes most decks are running something it can hit.  Even if you just kill a planeswalker token its Kill a  draw a card for two mana.  Worst case its a cantrip so it replaces itself so its never completely dead.  I agree that you will probably have more luck either going full control or midrange eldrazi.  Full control you have either no creatures or at most two usually Avacyn or Kalitas.  Everything else is planeswalkers and removal.  If you go the eldrazi route you can do BW with Wasteland Strangler and exile focused removal or my favorite Monowhite with a curve of Hedron Crawler Hangarback or Matter Reshaper Displacer Thought Knot and Reality Smasher with a couple of avacyns.  Then Secure the wastes A couple Gideons and white removal and you are good to go.

7633024,0,t1_d39stzz,Appreciate the comments Not sure why I want to be cutting Stomping Grounds for Scars lands when they can come in untapped just fine. Possibly Lavaclaw could go but I love being able to recur creature lands. We already have  Assault effects with Molten Vortex and Flame Jab along with other ways to discard more Ive found is detrimental to your overall gameplan. The split is definitely debatable. Blanking removal isnt really a goal of this list though Young Pyromancer can help overload it in some matchups. Bobs not your ideal tutor target but its probably the best CA engine you can get outside of Gitrog. In any case hes a fine card Im not looking to cut anytime soon if anything I could go for more of him. Liliana is rough on the mana though I see a lot of Jund Loam players swear by her. I might give her a spin in the future perhaps in place of a Decay. Spellskite is something I hadnt considered but it doesnt really solve any of the problem matchups beyond Bogles that still might be enough for a sideboard slot. I tried Tasigur he failed miserably. Delve doesnt happen fast enough and disrupts too many engines. Fulminator is something Id consider if I could more reliably enable a T Traverse with delirium but otherwise I suspect its mediocre without a recursion engine.

My assumption was that much of this hypothetical deck would be filled with dredge enablers and the payoff would be the combo finish of Valakut with a big Stunning Growth. In place of Vengevine Bloodghast Narcomeba and company youd fill it with Hedron Crab and other turboself mill cards and either something to dig for Stunning Growth like Taigams Scheming or Peer Through Depths or removal and permission to survive the first few turns while you mill half your deck. To that end Noxious Revival and Reclaim dont serve any purpose since youre just as likely to mill them as you are to mill Stunning Growth slow you down in a deck whose only theoretical advantage is speed and constrict your mana on the turn youre going off. Theyre likely to do nothing in the first couple of turns where you have less to do and possibly spare mana since you dont want to use them on anything other than SG unless you have another one in your hand or a duplicate RevivalReclaim and even if the stars align and you have one and the SG is in the graveyard you still need a way to draw it from the top of your library or another turn. ,spikes,d52yrqg,2,t5_2utkz

8284760,0,t1_d5d2j44,Are you asking about chalice because rotation costs one mana? Its very possible the second rotation isnt correct but chalice is not the argument against it. Most infect decks play a ponder in the slot where I have the second crop rot and chalice counters both of them. Chalice is just generally so good against this deck in general that your only way to win is to have an infecter before the chalice comes down and try to invigorate your way there and rotation can actually help with that also if you cast it in response to the chalice.I actually like crop rotation in most chalice matchups because chalice decks are almost always playing sol lands and cheating on mana also so crop rotting for a wasteland after they try their first big spell can often steal a game.I have considered cutting the second rotation though Im considering adding a second become immense or a ponder but I think Ill stick with two rotations for now at least.Boarding against delver really depends on which variant of delver and how well I think my opponent knows the matchup. As a very general rule that doesnt always apply on the play I cut all the forces and leave in the dazes and on the draw I cut  dazes for additional force of wills. Im never excited about force in the matchup because delver doesnt really have that many highimpact plays.Against RUG all the forces stay in the board play or draw. They have a very good resource denial plan so twoforoneing yourself just to get dazed or spell pierced isnt what I want to be doing.Grixis and sultai are more difficult dazes are great on the play and not bad on the draw so I usually keep at least two in and I dont love force here either but there arent many better cards in the board so I usually have to keep some number in.Sorry about the lack of a definitive sideboarding guide.

Optimally we need a looter or something that can help filter those draws and reduce some of the redundancy to help with the reduced blocking and spell density. Not sure what can go here!

8872901,0,t3_51rkof,Going down your listWhy is it no longer played?  There are  reasons it is no longer played.  The first is that bant company got spell queller and selfless spirit.  Spell queller disrupts tempo enough that tokens has trouble stabilizing against bant and the fliers all eat walkers much easier.  So a favorable matchup turned into an unfavorable one.  The second is that Emrakul was printed.  Emrakul wins the long game which used to be GW tokens place to shine.  Additionally GW tokens doesnt have any good answers to emrakul which leaves the deck in a bit of a lurch.  Third the format sped up.  Prior to EMN the format was pretty slow and there wasnt that much evasion allowing the tokens to really clog things up.  Post EMN though the format sped up a bit had more evasion and tokens couldnt quite stabilize like it used to.  It is still a powerful deck but it just didnt have enough good matchups in the top tier decks to remain top dog.What are reasonable replacements?  This will have to wait till spoiler season is over.  However since the core of the deck is really the ability to go turn  oath of nissa into turn  sylvan advocate into turn  nissa into turn  gideon into turn  avacyn none of which is rotating Im betting that some form of the deck will remain viable  but it is really going to depend on whether or not that is good enough over just playing a turboemrakul deck.Spoiled Toys?  Again wait till spoiler season is over.Change at being top tier post rotation?  Yes it has a chance.

Burn and melira company will make you dream of relaxing at home instead coming to this tournament Living end oh now goblin guide let me hide myself and my cards for the rest of the day Infect itself hi my name is melira what do you want from me? Or just show me a celestial colonade backed up by a steam vents and ill concede. Death Shadow combo. Really man? Im playing burn! RG valakut. Hello this is my glistener elf do you think it can face a Primeval Titan?And so on. In my honest opinion a deck like Bant Eldrazi or Jund fair decks has got fewer to zero UNWINNABLE match up. The ones that are tough nearly unwinnable can be adjusted postsideboard and this is true for every deck in the format if you go prepared to your local shop meta. Maybe the real problem are in big tournaments in which you can really face whatever deck the people wants to play this is a plus not a minus and you cant come prepared. Latest tournament i did i was playing melira company and i lost first match to uwr delver with geist of saint traft maybe because i missplayed but this is another story. The second match was against UB mill piloted but one guy that did path to exile on my hierarch when i was having  piece of the combo out. Of course i lost because that match up is nearly unwinnable but ehi this is it this is Modern.And honestly? I like it.I like because everyone can really play whatever he wants and the difference between a good tournament and a bad one is how good youre piloting your deck. Experience with your own deck is what really counts in modern and maybe also if you play a tier  or a rogue deck you can be the king of the hill if you can really play your stuff.So long live modern... without Force of Will.,spikes,d7swjnm,5,t5_2utkz

9045401,0,t1_d7yzi22,Not getting too deep into why its a bad card because its effect is certainly potent and hard to evaluate I will explain it the simple way. Imagine the spell you want to tutor for. Add  CMC. Would you ever put that card in your deck? now imagine you can start with that card in your hand every game. Are you ever happy about that?To break it down a bit more when can you have  mana free at sorcery speed to spend having zero effect on the board? No deck should be able to afford to do this. What can you even grab that is so good in a situation you are ok with spending  extra mana to get to play it?Sweepers? If you have enough time and mana to pay CMC for a sweeper you were not in danger of losing.Removal? if you have to pay  CMC to kill something you probably payed more killing it than they did casting it or they already got value.Finishers? if you have  open mana sure you could try to use it for this but if they are holding a removal spell for it you are boned.CMC is just too expensive for a tutor effect.

9093305,0,t3_54qk2z,I played GB delirium to very good success the last rotation and I like your list. Some small tweaks Id make  forest   blighted fen. I played  lands with  traverse and  colorless sources  fen  wastes I played  reality smasher and was able to cast my spells easily last rotation. Its an incredible answer for emrakul maindeck that does not cripple the manabase. I never played grim flayer but I was really happy with  sylvan advocates. I would play a  split favoring advocate if you want to play grim flayer. Sure gearhulk is great with trampleevasion but it also makes your advocates walls. You only need to put  counters on it to keep it out of grasp range and next turn you have a . Advocate is stronger late game since you have the ability to play it turn  and attack with a  and have a  blocker. I think  Noxious Gearhulk is worth a shot in the main its just so strong when you have liliana grapple and traverse. Also another artifactcreature for your graveyard When I started playing BG delirium I started with  traverse...then ...then . Its really really strong and worth considering . Id also play another ruinous path over  of the to the slaughter your instantsorcery balance is pretty heavy favoring the instants so you want to have a better balance to trigger delirium. To the slaughter is insane in the right matchup so definitely have it go to the side.For your sideboard Id consider playing some number of essence extraction since it kills pretty much anything in aggro and the  life practically fogs for a turn.

9148123,0,t3_55cezu,Okay this is by far my favorite version! In testing it does very well against most decks and it pretty consistently hits the magic kill spot around turn  with minimal disruption.My concernscomments Control matchups are pretty nightmareish. If you lose your reducers to their huge amounts of removal you are pretty dead in the water until a colossus which was often not as big a threat as it needed to be.  I found thoughtknots to be an overall worse sideboard plan over negatesdispels. Visions plan worked pretty well! However I think you need more red sources if you really want to consistently hit T visions in addition to hearlds the crumbling vestage is nice game one but sad game two.. Prisms help though! The other huge hit was fumigates killing your cost reducers is really sad and playing around it led to me losing more.  More kingpins! I think you want . Drop the parham it is  a win more in this deck. Nonspirts aggro was just silly. With kingpins out early and the big butts of kingpins and heralds it felt pretty easy to just fishbowl into a win. Spirits aggrotempo sucked. Queller on paradox is REALLY bad and nothing you have can block them! unwinnable even after sideboard. I dont know what could be done to improve the matchup here but its just terrible. Lost Legacy can hit paradox That happened a few times and it was usually a death sentence if they could handle the colossus route.,spikes,d8blakn,2,t5_2utkz

But yeah.Played it in a little tournament tonight but my hands were kind of bad and maybe I just played bad?Dropped Ugins for two mountains and the fourth Return. Cryptbreaker for Fiery Tempers and the millstone for Key to the City. Got a bye round one and two was versus RW vehicles.I probably should have mulliganed Mountain Neonate x Reunion Amalgam Haunted but I figured one land in a few turns was possible even with all that draw and I was on the draw but I didnt see land two until turn six and was dead when I drew it.Sided out the keys for two Fiery Tempers. Open with three lands a neonate temper haunted and copter. He killed my copter before I got to swing I took out a Cruiser with a discarded temper and but just drew lands that I couldnt get into play the right way to get he haunted out hard cast. By then two more cruisers were crushing me. Round three was enRG but he mulliganned to four game one and I eventually beat him by just recurring haunted dead and amalgams. I counted after the game and I had drawn  spells and  lands. So at least this deck can get repeat value? Game two he was flooded again and although he managed to Incendiary Flow my haunted and amalgam when I tapped out to activate a copter on my side of the board he had nothing so there felt like no reason to use my only octopus. Still I had another haunted in the grave so next turn I just tapped him out then did it again and he scooped.I dont know.

When youre gonna face your worst matchup basically never only  pilots in top  with only  more in a separate bad matchup of BG which by the way converts also at around the same rate as uw and your best matchups the rest of the way with a third of the entire field on your side youre guaranteed some sick results.Now lets look at the other GP Providence. of  decks we had  WU for  of the meta. BG had  for ..  WU made it to top  . conversion whereas  BG made it . conversion !!!. My interpretation of the data says that WU really hasnt converted except when it dodges the bad matchups. You notice I avoid the Top s because they really arent a good way to evaluate the best deck in the format. The reality is that not many people showed up trying to beat UW at either event and we see that those who did had exceptional performances. ,spikes,d9a4h2k,2,t5_2utkz

Third I think Manfields list seems to be the best guidance for side boarding. It does change however once you tweak your list to customize it and add things like Lost Legacy or an additional To The Slaughter. Fourth you will need to spend the time learning the meta or GB Delirium is not the deck for you. This is a deck that rides the margins to victory. It has a soul crushing end game but you have to get there first. You will not get there unless you understand how to defend yourselves from the various decks out there.

I would still recommend  Fields in the  though as having an out or two to a resolved Gideon is important you cant counter everything every game.Do not be afraid to board it out against G W or Nahiri decks post board especially if you showed them it or Stasis Snare G.

I feel Id have the same problem with Midnight Oil too only it guarantees  discard outlets to haunted or cathartic.

9576181,0,t1_d9tf60q,I mean you keep talking about how the entire magic community is playing burn wrong and youre somehow able to go against the mounds of information indicating that burn has bad matchups and be heavily favored against affinity. Burn can win against affinity sure. But affinity is notoriously one of the worst matches for burn and your limited experience referencing a small pool of affinity players who you have said yourself arent the best pilots is not indicative of the meta at large. Were not buying that Everyone else doesnt play the matchup right and are more inclined to believe that you havent had enough experience against actual affinity players and thats why you believe you have a good shot at it. Hence special snowflake.  FUCKING WAYS TO KILL CREATURES means very little when thats also your win condition and theyre flooding creatures while you dont have one of those  FUCKING WAYS TO KILL CREATURES since you spent them all killing other creatures and theyre being used to control a creature based deck that reaches critical mass while youre having to spend your resources each turn to kill their creatures. Routinely requiring double spells to kill a single creature group buffing in plenty of different methods little artifact destruction to hit the cranial plating. At my shop the RG Tron player routinely beats an infect player there . Judging from that am I to believe the RG Tron is favorable against infect now? Or should I see what the actual entire results in those matchups say and realize hes the exception based on personal meta circumstances? RG Tron must be good it beats a small pool of infect players my unverifiable personal experience must be true across all of magic as only that one RG Tron player is the best RG Tron player since he knows how to play the match correctly.Best of luck in this meta you wont make it far with affinity being popular. Youll realize that this weekend realize how bad burn is against affinity but never admit it so you dont have to seem that youre wrong.

Another option that I occasionally throw in my sideboard is Skyline Cascade which can buy you a bit of time. Another of that I swear by is Cyclonic Rift in the maindeck.

Lets say you drop two lands and the Vessel by turn . That means you have this left in your deck  hand creatures sorceries instants enchantments planeswalkers landsVessel will always go to the graveyard so we are looking to get at least  distinct nonenchantment card types in the reveal from VesselMost of the time you will get a spread of creatures and lands. You have an  chance to not hit any enchantments which is good but even if you do you can bring it the Vessel Im assuming to your hand for another try.The rest is seriously complicated but it comes to something like a  chance to actually hit  nonenchantment types in the top .Having one type in the yard already greatly increases this chance depending on the type of the card in the yard. Creatures and lands are obviously the worst to already have but having a sorcery means you still have  hits. Crap I didnt factor in the artifact creatures.

Sometimes you have a plethora of instant speed interaction which is really what the matchups all about and can play through spell queller and stuff easily and the ONLY card that you are worried about is gideon so you take your beats and kill stuff end of turn if possible. Honestly gideon is just an insane card in the matchup and an overly powerful card in general so some  of the time it will just get you. you have to be ok with that playing jeskai. Ive had better sucess with the UW matchup like  or  in my last  competitive league matches iirc since switching builds a little and using a lot more stasis snare  quarantine field  split respectively as well as siding dragonmaster outcast.

You cant control how theyre going to perceive you so dont waste all your mental energy getting worked up over it. Secondly while I can understand that FNM is more casual in nature compared to PPTQs or GPs its still technically competitive Magic and the newcasual players coming into that have to understand that. You shouldnt be forced to conform yourself or what you would play because youre afraid of what they might think or how they decide to approach that environment.  Thirdly to help them feel more comfortable and get more acclimated to playing more competitively you can do two things. One be as cordial polite and personable of an opponent as you can. Two give them some pointers help or advice about how they can be a bit more competitive going forward so that they dont just get smashed out by an opponent like you. Thats my take on the matter anyways. Not sure if its the answer you were looking for but if not let me know and we can discuss it further. ,spikes,daqa7zf,1,t5_2utkz

9861143,0,t3_5gibcy,Lets see if I can help a bit. First of all there are different kinds of heavyonanswers decks basically the control type and the midrangeBGx kind and they demand a different style of play.Control decks typically take a while to close the game so against them we are comfortable just throwing questions at them until they run out of answers. There are several reasons for this. First after SB we are going to be playing around  cards they must answer between our  main threats the Revelers and the Blood Moons. Second we play a lot more cantrips than they do so we are going to go through our deck faster. Third they play between  and  more lands than we do which means we are going to be drawing better as the game advances. Fourth they are hopefully going to be busy dealing with our game so will have it difficult to mount a relevant offense.What this all means is you just play your cards into theirs. I know its unintuitive but most control decks dont have many ways to pull ahead decisively on card advantage meaning they are stuck with mostly  for  and  for  answes which are easily countered by our much higher density of gas and filtering.This deck is not Infect and we are not going to be able to sculpt a winning hand through their full control grip so dont fall for the trap of waiting for a better moment to do what you have to do. Depending on the situation we need to build up to whatever card we judge will be the most decisive. At times it will be the Blood Moon at times it will be a Reveler into more gas at times well see their hand and well find out they dont have the right answer for Thing or we find out our Apostles Blessing will be good enough to give a Kiln Fiend an attack.But no matter how you plan it play your threats. If they have answers have them spend those answers so we can start cantripping for more questions as soon as possible. It is also important to trade as many nonthreats for answers as possible. Meaning be sure to use all the spells that could conceivably trade for an answer Growth Blessing Countermagic before playing a Reveler. This is the only instance in which we wait when we have a Reveler in hand and by playing it we would dump  or  of those cards. If we do so they are just going to answer the Reveler and whatever we drew so nothing was achieved. In those situations we wait as many turns as we need to until we find a threat and then try to trade all that protection for answers. Once this is done we can then play the Reveler into a softened hand.GBx decks are different because they can actually kill us fast. This makes it so we cant actually plan for a long game vs them because they will play a Tarmogoyf and force action whether we want it or not. This is also the reason this is a much more complicated matchup. They also have discard which makes it so the strategy of playing our threats in order of less dangerous to most will not work.These are very difficult matchups so its best to not get frustrated with them. In some games they will not have a good opener or will just misplay and our first or second threat will surprisingly get there. In others they will be crippled by a Blood Moon. In others they will take their time to land a threat because they are busy answering our threats and well get into Reveler territory at which point its actually possible to outgrind them. Information is extremely valuable. So are Blood Moons even if they are actively trying to fetch around them. At times they just wont be able to fetch around them at all. Worst case scenario they trade for a discard spell or a removal spell that then wont hit a creature. And in most cases they will get cut off a color or at least cut from casting Liliana and using Ravine.Generally speaking its equally good just like in the control matchups to not wait on landing your threats. They will still have their removal for the moment you decide to play them they will possibly be able to play  or more of those removal spells by then and your threats could easily be stripped of your hand in the meantime.Experience goes a long way. Control decks are not bad matchups they go from  to slightly favourable to us. BGx and Grixis Delver are worse matchups between  and  for us depending on the specific lists and the quality of the pilots. At times they can be frustrating because the games look unwinnable and the reason is... that they are often unwinnable. Tight play and knowing the matchups can win you the winnable ones and those are already a good number of matches for a bad matchup.Good luck!,spikes,dasxhp5,7,t5_2utkz

Capitalizing on time requires applying pressure or having some sort of continuous value engine which standard control doesnt have.gt also void shatter is also good against scrapheap scrounger if you can hit itScrapheap Scrounger is a drop that can only be countered the first time so Void Shatter is unlikely to work against it. Being able to use Disallow to prevent it coming back on the other hand could very well be important.gt as well as metalwork colossus decks.True. Disallow is usually worse against Colossus decks though being able to counter the Colossuss ability to recur itself or the Sanctum of Ugin trigger could be useful.

Its the only deck with access to real boardwipes and fares better vs RG energy BG delirium and other midrange decks than the others. It also has access to Blessed Alliance which is the cleanest answer to the decks worst enemy a t resolved  trample with hexproof and growth. If that gets to stay on board you WILL die.

You can also go for more splashy cards like Metallurgic Summoning to secure late game value. You can also easily fit Chandra Saheeli Rai or Fevered Visions as a part of your anti control  durdly deck package along with a full playset of Negate in the . The deck is good at handling vehicular aggro slightly better vs UW Flash than jeskai but significantly worse vs RG energy and worse vs Midrange due to the lack of unconditional removal and the loss of descend upon the sinful. The mana base is less painful and should screw you over way less.    I have no experience with BU summoning but Im unsure how the lack of good early interaction outside of Grasp of Darkness and having to rely of flaying tendrils as a boardwipe will make it fare against aggro.

And you completely left it out! Myself Id love to see Ancestral Vision. Casting that for free is pretty amazing. I think the strength of the deck is having a proactive approach with maybe counterspells in the SB. Playing a few Lilianas MB seems like a better fit for the current meta. Snapcaster helps keep your discarded spells available. Im excited to see what the blue and green Expertise cards will be.

The obvious good news however is that the counters will stick around even if it gets eaten. As far as Vehicles are concerned Id like to play around with it in Mardu Vehicles to see how it feels in place of Scraphead Scrounger. Obviously it would mesh well with the Dwarves particularly Toolcraft. Im not holding my breath however that Vehicle Decks are going to survive into Aether Revolt.

10206642,0,t1_dc02ha7,Reasons why I think it isnt better UR isnt so different to U in the storm deck. You are constrained on Blue mana not Red. A  beats down twice as fast as . Ive won countless games thanks to being able to swing in the last few points of damage with electromancers. Sometimes you just cant go off fully and end up having to grapeshot to kill the opponents creatures instead of their face.  Being Legendary sucks for this card. You get stuck on  lands a fair amount with UR storm a deck that only runs  lands. Having multiple Electromancers is great in this situation and has won me games by being able to help further reduce PiF or even flashback Desperate Ravings. In the sideboard you also have Empty the Warrens and in some builds Shatterstorm.  Sure storm can sometimes just have all the cards it needs and you can go off turn  or  without a problem but also a fair amount of the time you have to work hard and squeeze out every percentage possible to get the win. It isnt nearly as powerful as Legacy storm even though some people seem to think you always have magical Christmas land hands and thats how the deck always is. And I feel like having multiple Barals being unable to play extras stuck in your hand sucks its like card disadvantage you are effectively playing with one less card in hand. And in a deck like storm where blockingattacking with electromancers can mean all the difference this matters.Baral is a good card Ill be replacing one electromancer with him. But I wouldnt call him a straight upgrade whatsoever. Also with Fated Push spoiled the meta is expected to slow down and agro decks where Baral excels as a  over a  will be probably less prevalent. ,spikes,dc0za9i,1,t5_2utkz

The expertise seems quite obvious letting you cast two spells the turn after you play the enchantment potentially recovering your lost tempo from the turn before.Sanctuary is more nuanced and maybe too cute but very interesting. You essentially retool the deck to use spells which generate clues. Those clues help you cast your spells with the sanctuary as well as the summonings. You potentially get to hold up mana the same turn you play your enchantment and future activations help you cast more spells. It might not be worth skewing the deck to support that however.,spikes,dc6omeh,1,t5_2utkz

I find drawing  to be amazing in this deck because all the mana rocks you dont need anymore can be discarded to hand size while you get to keep the extra Colossi removal counters and Flagships you get. I will concede that this deck will have more dead draws late game than lets say a good stuff midrange deck but I just dont think thats the kind of the deck you want to run the colossus engine in.Something I find is that every single person on this sub seems to think turn  emrakul will be in every game and that if your deck cant beat it then your deck cant survive its hyperbole and really has no use. Yes I understand there is a combo deck in standard that CAN have a turn   creature that mindslavers you and there is a deck that CAN go infinite on turn  but the fact that those are decks does not mean every other deck that is not sligh hyper aggro or counter.dec cant compete. Those decks will not have it on turn  every game heck they wont even have it  of the time and even when they do there is still like a  chance they miss on the spin.

There is simply very little place for sorcery speed removal in this format. Vehicles Felidar Guardian manlands etc. kinda ensure that sorcery speed removal is not able to hit the things you need most.   Effect is redundant with Tezzeret in the deck. Sure you dont get the lifegain with Tezz but you do get this sorcery speed removal effect whenever you need it plus a  mana planeswalker. Battle does best in the decks Tezz is in but Tezz already does the removal half multiple times.   A lot of decks are focused on going wide right now  Ishkana Hanweir Battlements Srams Expertise etc. Id rather play Yahennis Expertise in any of the slots Battle would go in.

You want instant speed answers to card such as the Saheeli  Felidar Guardian combo. Also consider tweaking the deck for Refiner. I suggest dropping ElderDeep Fiends. Something to keep in mind is that if you utilize more Planeswalkers and  powered creatures such as the Refiner you can play Heart of Kiran and regularly crew it.

I know they played  obliteration but that was a super meta call. Dont play lost legacy main. It is guaranteed  card disadvantage. This deck is extremely weak to counters which were actually pretty good last format and will likely continue to be in new standard. Diabolical tutor is SO much worse than dark petition was.

10507964,0,t3_5qcjhx,Looking at your list the dream is to cast Herald on  Gearhulk on . But you are jumping through a bunch of hoops to hit that BB on  and GG on . With your payoff creatures getting their costs reduced your  drop slot is too full. Have you liked Tezzeret? Heralds or  I dont think there is any reason not to play the full set in a black improvise list. I would cut a Tezz because seeing  Tezz is terrible seeing  Herald is great. You are probably safe to drop  lands for  more maps.  drop artifacts are great for you if they can provide value. These give you fixing improvise revolt and open up T Rubuke. You probably want to squeeze in a th Servo Schematic as a T Map T Schematic T Bastion is a great line. Sadly this doesnt match up with GB counters because their best is T Snek T Rishkar leaving them with a T .This deck has no card draw. Reverse Engineer is a great sorcery if you can cast it on  or  but a lot of other redditors switched to Glimmer since it pairs well with Rebuke.Without any testing I would say that the Gearhulk is not the best fit for this deck. GG is going to hold you up a lot and is more than just simple splash. Tireless Tracker intrigues me and is twice as easy to splash.

Theyll be casting gearhulks glimmers etc. By the time it could take down a gearhulk youd have spent  mana to do so. The cards a great mana sink but it isnt that great against control decks its a very slow clock on its own and its best feature doubling as a removal spell for small creatures is completely worthless in that muchup.  ,spikes,dd489xv,2,t5_2utkz
10554042,0,t1_dd4c731,If youre holding up mana to use at the end of your opponents turn on a Walking Ballista that means your not using that mana too actually cast spells to advance your boardstate. Itll be rare that your  opponents are bothering to kill it at any point besides your end step where you can no longer hold up mana. Being able to sink  mana into two extra cards as opposed to a single  counter is much better against control decks though. The goal is to get extra value out of everything in your deck as so much of theirs is removal and draw spells if you just go  back and forth adinfinitum hell get to resolve a glimmer of genius or gearhulkremovalglimmer. Nissa also doesnt draw cards and tracker is great because it can get value in the form of card draw even when it is removed the turn it comes down. If they want to give you  cards for your two its frequently correct to take that as oppose to turning a declaration in stone into a swords to plowshares.

10648704,0,t3_5sbmus,My two cents as a longtime rock player  Jund closes a lot faster the game and can shut the door even against the bad matchups big mana if your draw is good.   This is also the reason Bob is so much better in Jund over Junk its not that Junk has a much higher average cmc its just much harder to close the game before you suicide on bob than it is in jund.  Junk on the other hand plays the long game better and is favoured against the other midrange decks due to Lingering Souls. Its a different playstyle slightly more grindy value focused and a slightly better sideboard against certain matchups.   In the end its up to you what you enjoy more and how your local meta looks like. If there is a lot of Jund Grixis etc. id go with junk if small creature decks and combo are running around stick to Jund.  From a financial perspective seeing as you have all the big money cards already Junk is slightly cheaper first man lands and fast lands are cheaper.  Regarding Flayer Great in Junk average in Jund. I play  in my current Jund list over the rd Ooze and rd drop to have  drops that pressure the opponent. Its doing alright atm.  In the end it depends in what you enjoy more and what you get more repps in with are more comfortable playing. Proxy the last cards and test some or get into Junk first cuz cheaper and try Jund at some point down the road.,spikes,ddeby9s,1,t5_2utkz

Thien called a judge for precisely that reason then remarked upon the situation regarding combat and such. The judge then clarified the situation and ruled that Cesar had missed his ability to crew. Regardless of what Thien didwhich he admitted was angleshooting and was unsportsmanlike the rule is the problem and should be looked at. Again I completely disagree that the language barrier was the issue as Cesar explained to the Spanishspeaking judge exactly what he was attempting to do and even while being completely explicit was still ruled against.

10684645,0,t1_ddhx3fy,Its true the rule isnt perfect but its better than the alternative which allowed AP to use verbal trickery to glean information about what NAP was doing before combat. This was the case for many years before the combat shortcut was changed and resulted in a lot of angleshooting and gotcha! magic.While the result is awkward in a few cornercase situations it presents problems in a lot fewer situations than the previous approach did.Some examplesAP Combat?  NAP Okay  AP Starts attacking  vsAP Combat?  NAP Okay  AP Activate Mutavault and attack with everything  vsAP Combat?  NAP Cryptic Command tap your team  AP Okay since you did that in my main phase I can play Goblin Guide and attack  vsAP Combat?  NAP Cryptic Command tap your team  AP Okay activate Mutavault and attackIf the combat shortcut isnt explicit and remember that language barriers might make it so one person cant tell the different between combat and attacks in the language being spoken then theres no way for NAP to tell the different between these scenarios meaning they have to tip their hand without knowing where AP is trying to get them to act.Yes we could require that players be explicit about when things are happening but players dont actually play magic like that. Furthermore requiring that in these situations still put the onus on NAP to define where we are when it is AP who is proposing the shortcut. This essentially gives AP a free priority pass to find out what NAP is going to do before they do it which also goes against the rules.,spikes,ddi1gkk,1,t5_2utkz
10684928,0,t1_ddhlr97,gtIts not currently possible.I dont know what information youre trying to keep hidden from youre opponent because thats not how the timing and priority work. Its not possible ever to move to combat first with the intent to target a vehicle with the Weldfast Engineer trigger without crewing your vehicle in your main phase. If you pass priority for your main phase and you havent crewed the vehicle you intend to target with the trigger the vehicle will not be a legal target for the trigger when it goes on to the stack. Here is what the timing looks like for the phases. AP passes priority to end Main Phase . NAP passes priority to end Main Phase . Weldfast Engineer trigger and any other BoC triggers goes on stack with target announced. . AP and NAP pass priority with trigger on the stack. Stack resolves.. AP gains priority at Begining of Combat. . NAP gains priority at Beginning of Combat.Bottom line Theres no information youre going to be able to hide from your opponent without either your engineer or your vehicle getting lit up before the trigger resolves. What are you trying to gain?,spikes,ddi2ilt,1,t5_2utkz

10693497,0,t1_ddi8gr7,So you say that in the first case the NAP can just use the shortcut instead of you? Where exactly in the rules can you find it? According to the rules when the NAP passes the priority in the First main phase the game automatically jumps to the Beginning of the Combat phase step. This is also what happens in Magic Online. I dont want to stay in the main phase I want indeed to know whether the NAP agrees to move the game on to the next step where I get my priority at the beginning of that step.The question with floating mana could be used even if he doesnt have any mana floating just for the sake of moving to the Begining of the Combat step with AP retaining the priority there. Theres really no difference between asking ending main phase do you do anything with floating mana? and asking ending main phase do you do anything? Magic online does exactly that imho. I just pass the priority at the end of main phase and if NAP passes the priority we move right away to beginning of combat step with me as AP having priority before declare attackers. If Magic Online can do just that without revealing any information it should be perfectly possible to do that exactly that in the real world with the right wording.The second case I dont retain the priority in the main phase. I simply ask whether we do move to the Beginning of the Combat where I will retain the priority before we enter attackers if he says YES to this we are simply there with me having priority he just agreed to exactly that.There are many reasons why I would want to find myself at the beginning of the combat phase before declare attackers having priority as the AP. E.g. I want to cast a bolt? I want to activate my own Icy Manipulator to tap his creatures I want to cast my own Cryptic Command to tap his creatures before I declare attackers to see if he response to it. Etc etc...It would really be great to hear official response in the rulebook about this. If this works just fine in magic online there should be no reason why this should not work in the real world. Just state a crystal clear shortcut phrase that moves players right to the beginning of combat step with AP having the priority. In fact it already is there every step has its own name. Just make people use them properly. If they can remember untap upkeep draw then they can remember beginning of combat declare attackers declare blockers damage as well.,spikes,ddiye2j,1,t5_2utkz

Theres no downside.What comes out against control is things that dont provide lasting value compared to cost like Rishkar when you can expect all your other creatures are dead when you cast it.  Against vehicles I might be wrong but I think its your card advantage and enormous creatures that naturally win the game over them.  The point of having  removal spells is so you dont lose the early game to a cycle of they play a creature you play a creature they kill your creature play another and attack.

10756275,0,t3_5tsejy,I would say BTL is favored but they definetly have draws thatll blow you out. Overall some tips on the matchupYou basically only care about Karn Worldbreaker and Ulamog. Save your counters for those. Ignore Wurmcoil Engine Ugin OStone etc. Save Cryptic for Ulamog if you can because you can counter and bounce one of the lands they wanna exile. Similarly you can do the same interaction to World Breaker if needed. Izzet Charm can hit turn  karn which feels fucking sweet. it is sometimes right to use cryptic to bounce a tron land instead of draw a card. I.e they go turn  karn counter karn bounce tower is a huge tempo play that makes them have exactly another karn to do anything hugely relevant next turn.games  and  are all about crumble to dust. Snap keep any hand that can cast crumble quickly. Once you crumble them you have some time to find another shiftbtl so dont worry about using your only btl to cast crumbleI dont hate bringing Slaughter Games for Ulamog as its by far their best card in the matchup. This depends on how many bad cards you have in your maindeck. Its not fantastic but its better than say electrolyze or anger of the gods. remandingizzet charmingnegating Sylvan Scrying is often a good call. Especially if itll complete their Tron. This is something that people neglect to do Ive noticed. warping wail is a card. Just sayin. it is usually right to sac STE ASAP as he isnt blocking in this matchup and they might bring in Sudden Shock to nab him. Overall your gameplan is stalling them until you can scapeshift them game one which gets tricky because sometimes you can have a slowcombo hand.

10771766,0,t3_5u0msj,Ive been trying various versions of statuary improvise and am still working on it.Among things Ive tried are Gx Eldrazi UB Control and Esper Control. Trying just WBu as opposed to UBw next because I think Thraben Inspector might shore up some of my perceived problems with the deck.Things Ive found so far are. Your artifacts should either do something or cantrip at minimum.. No matter what it ends up being a ramp controldeck once I play Inspiring Statuary.. Once I play Inspiring Statuary Herald of Anguish and Reverse Engineer arent worth playing. With Herald the problem is that a Statuary typically pulls you to  Mana T not  and b too often youre a little too behind on board once you land it. Sure it doesnt DIE to Grasp but if you have to block or other player has Ballista  Grasp etc. it will die. With Reverse Engineer UU is obnoxious when you can improvise a Glimmer of Genius and dig a little deeper while leaving a land open for another improvised spell. For the record if theres a build thats less behind on board by the time it plays Demon its probably really good.. Tez is not consistently good. Hes conditionally good  if youre meaningfully behind on board and have lt artifacts he is probably not good. Hes much much better when he lands with you already having  artifacts. Both of the above given his ult is fast and real. Given his Ult Id sooner play him than not but Ive also lost a good number of games where it felt like he was doing absolutely NOTHING for me.. Turbo Ulamog is real but its much safer to do it without servos in which case hell come down T or T in a sane build and if you can keep him alive for two more turns you win but theres a real chance he gets Stasis Snared Decd in Stone etc.. Chaining the Awaken extra turn spell is also possible. . If you play Statuary the investigate counterspell is real good but you also cant play it as a of since you lose a lot of tempo to establish your mana.. Yahennis Expertise is pretty solid with statuary.. Metallic Rebuke is amazing.. I think the deck probably wants some  of Heart of Kiran.  . Theres almost no reason this deck cant splash anything of any color as a late game card.Anyway I continue to believe that theres probably a deck.

For the first time ever I got hit by my own Mindwrack Demon on my upkeep with this deck. Plus I just wasnt happy with the Demon at  mana. Its crazy to say though since its a  Flying Trampler for  but its true. It made for some awkward hands when you get to turn  and  and have  of the Demons in your hand. I found myself spending all of my mana on one card that got countered by Jeskai and Unlicensed by Mardu.Grim Flayer is awesome but most of the time thats only the case if he can hit the board as a . Shock andor Push is practically in every list in the format.I dont have any personal experience with the Energy variants so I will not say much about them. However I will say that I am surprised to see so many bold people playing Siphoner with so many Ballistas Pushes and Shocks running around.I do like a list somewhat like the list that won the GP this past weekend. I think Sylvan Advocate is great for multiple reason. Its a good draw later in the game as a  mana . It has vigilance so it can attack and defend. If youre playing Harvester you will always have something open to crew even after attacking. Putting counters on it with a Rishkar on the field lets you attack and hold up mana at the same time for things like Heroic Intervention and or using Ballistas ability. You can also cast it later in a game after a resolved sweeper and wake up a  Quagmire to start applying pressure again.,spikes,ddsefqf,4,t5_2utkz

11087486,0,t1_deibunv,So I went to the standard evernt at my LGS last night and I had an amazing time with  people including me showing up for it. And best of all I put up a    record! It was so hype I didnt expect to do that well. Here is the list I brought A few notes about it from last time. I decided to put back a renegade map in for a key to the city. I ran a lot of practice hands at home by myself and I felt map really helped with my mana fixing and made my deck a lot more consistent. Kept the  paccification arrays still in here cuz it has become one of my favorites in this deck. And I went down  to rebukes and up to  fatal pushes in my mainboard. I just felt that fatal push is just so good against BG which I was told is huge in my meta here. And I also kept  cogworkers even tho I wanted to go down a little bit on it. I realized that having either a servo schematic or cogworker out turn  is just so huge for my deck because it allows me to ramp into my creatures faster and also help leave improvise mana open for rebukes. I was scared of how my deck might just get crippled if i miss that servo or cogworker  drop so i decided to keep all of them in here for now. Also now as you can see im a lot weaker against control by having removed a key a rebuke and virtually no card draw without the reverse engineers i took out last time. But I was just hoping to keep BG and aggro under control which i expected to see and just be awesome against control when I get to sideboard.Match  against Cat Combo  Marvel  Game  I started off so strong curving out to a bastion inventor perfectly at turn  and then a herald turn . But i lost because my opponent played cat turn  and then saheeli turn  with nothing for me to do. I didnt have any removal in hand to kill the cat the turn i played herald oh well. Game  I sided in  rebukes  negates and  implement of combustion. Had a very long and grindy battle with my opponent and all the cards I sided in proved to be very handy and I eventually was able to beat my opponent with a herald that stuck. Game  Omg this game. I thought I had this game won so many times but my opponent was a god. I had him down to  life and was about to swing with my herald for lethal but my opponent activates marvel and gets a free fumigate cast from it which destroyed all my creatures and he gained  life to..ugh. A few turns later I feel pretty great again with a tezzerets touch and a bastion inventor on board. But my opponent draws a fumigate on his turn and kills my board presence again. But then a few turns later I have another herald on board and I feel like im going to win this one but he activates marvel and he casts an Ulamog for free...like wtf lol. Exiles my shit and he wins. I couldnt do anything but laugh here XDMatch  against BG constrictor.   Game  I layed the beatdown on my opponent with tezzerets touch and herald and with a hand full of removal. My opponent was also flooding in land a bit. Easy win. Game  Very long and back and forth game. A critical juncture in the match was where he had  creatures on board including a constrictor with  counters on it and a walking ballista with  counters on it. I had a herald and a combination of  servosthopters. With his ballista he chose to shoot down  of my servosthopters. On my turn i activated heralds ability to give  to the ballista and in response he shot down my last servo. I then fatal pushed his snake. After that I was able to maintain firm control of the board and eventually won the game. But we discussed at the end that if he used his  ballista shots to take down my herald instead of my army of servos and thopters he likely would have won that match.Just realized I wrote so much already so ill keep the final  games super concise haha.Match  against BG constrictor   This game was against the same dude I played with on saturday who beat me   . But this time I drew really well and I didnt make any mistakes this time around and in both my games my big creatures and removal was just better than his. Match  Esper ControlMill   Game  So this guy was just here to have some fun and not play a serious deck. But he managed to get me down to only  cards! He played a card that makes me mill  cards. He played  of them haha. And I was really only able to get an army of servosthopters down but I was able to swing for lethal in time with a top deck tezzerts touch. Game  I boarded in  rebukes and  negates. I never let him get much going and was countering his shit left and right and had a sick unlicensed disintegration on his torrential gear hulk when he flashed it in to block my herald. Easy win here but even tho it was against a weird fun deck I was still super happy to win my final match and end my night at   !So a super successful night imo and I had a great time. Super hyped that i was able to win in both my BG constrictor matches. Also Herald gave my opponents fits all night. Got so much praise from my opponents after the games on how great of a card Herald is. I fucking love this guy. From observing I saw that there were  people playing BG constrictor  RG energy  cat combo  marvel  BW eldrazi  esper controlmill  Mardu vehicles and me with Grixis improvise. There are  people I guess who I didnt get a chance to observe and see what they played. Not sure what to change about my deck after this experience. Maybe someone could give me some advice? I drew into key to the city a lot and it was beneficial at times but I wonder if I didnt draw it as much if I would of missed it or not. Thinking about if I need to bring this back up to . Also metalic rebuke has always been good when i played it so im not sure if keeping it at  is good enough prob need to find a way to increase it back up to .Sorry for this super long post but just feeling pretty hyped right now haha.,spikes,deor967,2,t5_2utkz

Deaths Shadow doesnt particularly enjoy having to wade through tons of blockers and a combo finish gets around the Shadow getting stronger as you try to kill them. The questions are whether you can piece together the combo in the face of piles of discard and removal and how well you can fend off Eldrazi. I think Kiki Chord is decent at holding back the latter but I dont know how reliable a  Kiki is going to be against Tarfire and Kolaghans Command.

Days away from work for  Pro Toursyear is already pretty high. But I play magic differently now. Pretty much the only time at my local shop is prereleases which are really ways for me to get PT limited testing in. My team gets to the PT the weekend before I get there Weds.All my time is spent preparing for actual events that matter for pro points PTsGPs or RPTQ either via direct testing or keeping current with the meta by following articles mtggoldfish. I need to fill  GP slots and am probably  to get pro points at a given GP which means I need to plan for about  GPsyear. Add in  RPTQ for PTs im not already Qd for puts me at about  important eventsyear. I probably spend  hours doing magic related things in an off week hours watching coverage on weekends adds up and add an additional  hrsweek for  weeks leading up to GPs and an additional  hrsweek for  weeks leading up to PTs. I do occasionally go to SCG events  but usually dont despite them treating me pretty well  SCG open top in  attempts and Ive only made it out to  invi my teammate stole my luck but used it well despite being Qd for more  I just cant afford to play on that circuit and the PT circuit timewise.Balance wise  if I find myself playing more than this I cut back. I plan in advance with my wifejob so I can go to tournaments. My goal is to be the best in the world  but realistically with my current level of dedication I cant get there. According to ELO  I came within a single match of being  for a single round but hit a heavy loss streak and and dropped out of the top. This was around the time I felt magic was affecting my job performance so I cut back which basically makes it impossible for me to try for platinum and pretty unlikely I can keep the win rate I enjoyed when I thought about magic much more than I do now.Unless you go full time which I never intend to try you simply need to accept you will never be as good as you could be  and that that is okay. As a very competitive person is that frustrating  yes  it sucks to make match losing misplays due to lack of prep. But ultimately while magic is my competitive outlet and I really enjoy the matches where hundreds or thousands are on the line its still just a game to be played for fun. As a hobby you should decide how much time you feel comfortable playing it  and dont play more than that.

Its such a bad matchup that you just have to get lucky.Compelling Deterrence is hopefully okay with less sources because you only have few copies just . And in the matchups where you bring it in the game usually goes long. Late game is fine for the card because you want to hit Cast Out.Compelling Deterrence could actually not be good enough because of the lack of blue sources. I am testing  Fetid Pools  Swamp to increase the blue sources. If Compelling Deterrence is not good enough you could try the fourth NeverReturn or To the Slaughter decent against Torrential Gearhulk and you sometimes get delirium with Concoction.The problem with double blue is that you need  sources just to get it consistently on turn seven. We are not even close to that number.

In this set cards like Faith of the Devoted Bontus Monument Throne of the GodPharaoh and Hazoret the Fervent become twice as good because each opponent means it hits both of the other players.Abuse these sorts of cards as best as you can.

11782348,0,t1_dgv4waz,Also true but Ive already moved on to other things.,spikes,dgvkfiz,1,t5_2utkz
11783404,0,t1_dgvo78l,yeah I like it a lot.I like how they removed the Thalias now that Cat isnt a concern as much as Thalia as bae. Death and Taxes playerI like reintroducing the other vehicles as well to help you go bigger.Main deck Nahiri is a great response to gods.I like how Glorybringer is in the deck because Glorybringer is fucking great while not getting rid of Avacyn because Avacyn is a great answer to your opponents Glorybringer.The one thing Im not sold on is the Veteran Motorists especially if we recognize our new GB overlords. either way Im going to make some changes to my deck similar to what he did because I think this list is the truth.,spikes,dgvoqwh,5,t5_2utkz

11790285,0,t1_dgv6gkc,Ive been testing in a Bant shell with vizier of the menagerie and more often then not I get a LOT of value out of her . But I usually dont cast her on turn . Or shes a finisher.,spikes,dgwgvkb,1,t5_2utkz

11800118,0,t3_683a7z,Im still intrigued by Key to the City. Coming down on turn  is usually enough to force through a Scroungerdrop plus a Temper at a creatureface.It enables Hazoret gets him on consistently and acts as a great means of getting back into the game when decks like Tower start to grind you out. Even if its bad cycling giving your lands late in the game cycling is pretty legit.Ive been playing  on and off and its been backbreaking against GB in particular. Even jamming in your Scroungers every turn adds up to the point where it consistently represents  damage every game excluding any HazoretFiery Temper turns. If we really want to go deep on madness then it also enables Bloodhall Priest. ,spikes,dgxl1g3,1,t5_2utkz
11802359,0,t3_68czv0,Great job Don!! I really love the detailed Finals report. Ive really been loving Forsake the Worldly myself Id recommend it when youre taking a more controly route.How do you think a third Glorybringer could fit into this list? Is it borderline good or just not worth it in your opinion?Would you change anything about the mana?,spikes,dgxu6x2,2,t5_2utkz
11803990,0,t1_dgy0rzg,Oh man people will complain about anything. Damn and I really like that card.,spikes,dgy0ugd,5,t5_2utkz
11804983,0,t1_dgy3w9q,thats the obvious downside. the question is if that situation occurs enough to outweigh the aftermath benefit,spikes,dgy4w7q,3,t5_2utkz
