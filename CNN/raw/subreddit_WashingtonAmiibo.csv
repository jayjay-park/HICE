3813846,0,t3_3435mr,I think this is a nice idea. With enough people we can cover our bases pretty well maybe if we say need help checking a store thats too far away but we have a closer Amiibro or something like that we can team up.I typically hunt in the Everett and Lynnwood area. I sometimes venture to Mukilteo or Mountlake Terrace but not if I can help it. On rare occasion Ill hit up Northgate if Im that far south because of business. Id be willing to check stores for people if need be.,WashingtonAmiibo,cqr0chx,1,t5_37zie

4515759,0,t3_3cppht,I went to the game stop in Issaquah. I was first in line three hours early. Their were  ness and  dedede. Only  people showed up in line before opening so I kind of waisted my time waiting that long but its better to be safe than sorry. So happy to finally have Ness and Dedede.  ,WashingtonAmiibo,cszuu40,1,t5_37zie

4906681,0,t1_cud0jpl,Villager is never an easy target. But Im glad you take notice. Of course I want you to enjoy your trip to Canada for whatever reason and limit my own footprint. I just thought it would be nice if you kept an eye out. Me I never like to take full advantage on someone not saying its wrong at all for some people. You enjoy Canada and if you see a Villager that would be thoughtful! However I do have a new sidebar Wish list if you are looking for other requests.,WashingtonAmiibo,cud0vef,1,t5_37zie
5311064,0,t1_cvqi643,If the toys r us restock is any indication of the restock numbers for villager and marth its looking to be hopeful. Its a matter of how well Best Buy handles it. Toys r us did a great job withholding rare stock and limiting purchase quantities to provide a fair chance for most. ,WashingtonAmiibo,cvqjthw,1,t5_37zie
