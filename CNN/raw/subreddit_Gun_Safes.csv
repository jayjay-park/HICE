11575537,0,t3_57ooho,If its an accessory how easy is it to remove by a thief?Hard to remove could mean hard to install.  Difficult install is a barrier or gindeance to purchase.Overall i like that idea more than fingerprint or DNA pistol grips or backstraps using a bracelet I mean.Im just unsure how you propose integrating it into a long gun or pistol to make said weapon unusable... Without it also requiring smithing or obstructing the slide or taking up a pistols limited rail space.Would it go into the trigger guard? So many questions about design... ,Gun_Safes,dg83d7b,1,t5_3e9a7
