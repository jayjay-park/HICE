Also if each weapon is given a certain number of points either  or  of the weapon stat how can you allocate different amounts to them?

5597135,0,t3_3rbayj,This is it I have to win this one to move on.We have basically the same speed so neither of us will have a maneuvering advantage so Im gonna have to drive smart.  Avoid his wedge at all costs and attack him from the sidesback.  If I can manage to get one of his wheels into my claw that would be ideal but either way I need to get him up on my wedge and start pushing him around as much as I can.  Once I have control I try and put him into the hazards as quick as possible and let them go to work.  His traction is only a little higher than mine so he can push me a round a little but I should still have a chance to fight back in that aspect if I do it strategically.It will be a tough fight this week.

5865230,0,t3_3uywhn,So Aphelion is about as fast as me and has a more powerful weapon and Dreadnought has about as powerful of a weapon as I do and is way faster. Ive got... uhh... a useless shock absober? A bunch of torque? I could use that to push my opponents around if you know this wasnt a flipper battle. No matter! Maybe being rearhinged will do something for me... who knows. I expect Ill end up on my back at some point so Ill get to try out my selfrighting at least.My strategy this is a three robot rumble so trying to predict what both of my opponents will do is not going to be very helpful. So Im just going to start out driving clockwise around the outside of the arena spiralling in and hoping to get at the sides of one of my opponents and flip them. If theyre going after each other Ill wait until one gets flipped then rush in to flip the other while its not paying attention to me. If theyre going after me Ill try and keep my wedge in front and hope I get underneath them instead of vice versa. Good luck you guys!

8601065,0,t3_4xko6s, I have the better drive train my traction is actually  better armour and a much better wedge which will be the key to my strategy. Barring an act of God I should be able to control when and where I make contact and should be able to get under Channel One II pretty easily. Ill always lead with the plow. Channel One II doesnt have the weapon power to hurt my wedge at all and even on Hellhounds body it wont be doing much damage. The plan is to get under it deny it full traction and slam it into walls and hazards. I wont box rush. Theres no need to. Ill just go about my business. If I get flipped selfright with the sniffer if I have space. If I dont have space Ill drive inverted until I have the room to selfright safely. Basically Ill stay on the attack for the most part but not stupidly. I wont drive into hazards for the lulz. If the drum breaks the laws of physics and gets under me Ill back up rapidly my rear wedges are skirts not fixed the render just sucks and Jturn away to escape.

9224652,0,t3_568yhj,AnalysisAlright looks like its time for Dreadnoughts next battle downsizing a bit from fighting a spacecraft to fighting a bird thats often held as an omen of impending death and other such spookiness in several cultures. Cant afford to get complacent though so with that lets see what I need to do to book my place into the Final Four. To begin with the big things to note on Raven are that hes got a slight speed advantage over me although were even for torque surprisingly can lift and press his wedge down with that supertough Scoop he has and hes pretty tough allover at  Armour even considering his  Armour Bonus. So yeah hes going to be hard to hurt directly and Ill want to be careful if I want to avoid getting rammed all over the shop and immobilised like Exertion was. However although hes a tough customer hes still got a number of weaknesses that I should be able to exploit against it here. To start off with the drivetrain although he seems like one of those designs that relies on using high speed and power to ram people and stop spinners hes actually only  point faster than I am so Im still definitely fast enough to keep up with the same TorqueTraction and considerably worse manoeuvrability due to his lower Traction ratio and sixwheel drive compared to my two. So hell be good at going in straight lines but hell definitely have some trouble trying to keep up with a machine thats as agile and as slippery as Dreadnought. Further elaborating on this his Torque is only the same as minewhich serves to remove what usually be a big advantage for him. Ill reach my top speed faster than he will due to my slightly lower speed which will be crucial in helping me to dodge and counter his pushes and stop him from driving off my wedge before I can flip him and well stalemate in any pushing matches meaning that I can both dodge and counter his pushing attempts his main form of attack as and when necessary. His other big weakness lies in the design of his weapon. Although yes he can push it down to make his wedge stronger there are a number of serious flaws with the design of the lifting scoop that can be taken advantage of effectively even discounting its low speed and power at only  Firstly if he presses down with it hell lift his front four wheels off the ground and slow himself down with them considerablyif we assume that his speed is divided by a third along each row of wheels pressing down the Lifter will most likely cut his speed down from  to approximately . Strengthens his ability to get under yes but thatll make him a sitting duck for being manoeuvred around. Second the design of the forks themselves. They have flat sides so itll be possible to effectively angle around them from any direction except directly headon are very long thus are likely to end up being warped by hazards or get stuck on the arena wall ala Skorpios in Battlebots Season  and as going by the full picture included above they dont raise very high so he wouldnt be able to flip me with themnor would he be able to trap me on them due to the way my wheels are laid out allowing me to just drive off them any time he gets under me. Third and most crucially of all they dont work upsidedown and he by extension completely loses all his effective wedges when hes flipped. That means that whilst itll take a lot more work for him to immobilise me one crucial flip is all it could potentially take for me to get him into a position where I can accordingly put him out of the arena. In terms of his defences although his Armour is pretty good allround his tyres are still pretty exposed to being torn up and the bumper on the back with all those spikes on it is a liability against a fast wedgebased design such as Dreadnought. If its tipped up onto its back even slightly itll rest on the rear bumper instead of the rear wheels which means if hes wedged hes going to find it extremely difficult to pull off the classic drive off the wedge if he gets under trick and itll accordingly be much easier for me to push and flip him. And againif hes flipped hell lose all his useable wedges and be much easier to put over the wall.So overall? Although Ravens a fantastic design for killing spinners with the big problem he has is that he focusses a bit too much on that side of him. As such there are quite a few noticeable factors that come into play when hes fighting a different type of machineespecially one like Dreadnought that can not only flip him over thus putting him in a position that pits his greatest weaknesses against my greatest strengths but is also fast and powerful enough to both keep up with his speed and match his strength.StrategyAnyway lets get down to business. Move out quickly and the option I take from there depends on what he tries to do. If hes evidently going for a boxrush approach and as soon as he starts getting close immediately reverse Jturn out the way as he begins to approach then quickly swoop underneath before he can react. If he tries pressing the wedges down angle my wedge in towards the sidescorners of the forks to force my way underneath. If he tries angling around me himself reverse Jturn out the way to either keep my front facing him or dodge out the way ala the first approach. If he raises his forks boxrushes and tries to drive over my wedge and get behind me keep the wedge facing him and reverse as he gets in close to catch him on my wedge instead. In any case feign the initial approach and then when he makes his move counter it accordingly and get underneath. If he gets underneath me though dont panic. Since regardless of where he pushes me from Ill always have contact with either the ground or his forks it means Ill be able to escape regardless of whether he lifts me or simply chooses to push. If he tries to flip me reverse off if I can so that I can drop down and counterattack by getting underneath before he can retract his wedge. If he simply tries pushing or the above does not work simply reverse Jturn off so that he passes by then counter by attacking him before he can turn around. In any case though by taking an aggressiveyetstillpragmatic approach to getting past his scoop I should be able to get underneath himand as soon as I do flip him over immediately to nullify his wedge but only when Im absolutely sure hes on my wedge to both conserve gas and avoid any freak accidents that could lead to him damaging my flipper. When I do have him flipped be very aggressive keep him flipped and myself underneath for as much as I possibly can copying his movements with my better acceleration and agility and the lack of purchase hell have if he tries to drive off or over the wedge to keep him trapped if necessary  predominantly go for the knockout by flipping him out of the arena and in between attempts to do so make use of the environment to score points and deal damage. Establish dominance of the middle of the arena early on to force him onto the defence and near the hazards and by extension to take away his speed advantage by not giving him any chances to use it. Always be ready to cut off any potential escape routes. Attacking predominantly revolves around keeping him upsidedown and trying to flip him out of the arena for the knockout. In between attempts though by all means use additional means to score points and inflict damage if they dont put me in too much risk in particular pinning him into the Pulveriser corners with my wedge and flipping him into the Screws would be good as will flipping and ramming him into the walls and squashing him into the walls to wear down the clock. Turn him back over immediately if I do accidentally reright him. In any case though be aggressive give him no opportunities to escape or right himself and do everything possible to flip him out. Because were of pretty similar speeds to each other defending myself is based mostly around watching what he does the whole time acting accordingly limiting his means of attacking as much as possible whilst still being aggressive and taking the fight directly to him and keeping him forced onto the back foot. Take the approaches described above if he tries getting underneath or lifting me to stop him pressing any attacks and try to vary them as much as I can as and when necessary to remain unpredictable. Keep the front end facing him as much as I possibly can and keep the back and sides wellprotected throughout. If I do end up flipped though hopefully I shouldnt be selfright immediately to stop him from following up. Keep him upsidedown to prevent him from bringing the Lifter and his pressable wedge into play and against the walls to stop him from making much use of the hazards keep a good berth from the hazards when Im not taking him to them myself and in particular STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THE SCREWS AS I POSSIBLY CAN. Getting caught in those happened to me once already against Error  in the Qualifiers and I sure as hell dont intend to go out that way here.Well hopefully this should cover it. Raven looks like a very tough robot to fight but with the approaches described above hopefully Dreadnought should be able to make it hop the twig. Good luck though Adam heres hoping this QuarterFinal match will be a good one!,RpRoomFBB,d8lajql,1,t5_3962h
9928170,0,t3_5gwph3,PART ONE AnalysisWell this is it. The Battlebots Pressure Drop Final  and its up against my old rival Kody with his dangerous axeflipper hybrid Tellu. As far as I know hes actually gone unbeaten here so far at least in the main competition with a sizeable amount of KOs along the way so I know its going to take everything Ive got to beat him here. Forgive me in advance for the much longer RP than usual but this is one battle that I simply must win. OK first things first. The big thing to note on him is of course that massive axeflipper arm hes got powered and has been shown to be capable of killing most robots in approximately two or three direct shots from the axe side and its also quite good at turning stuff over with the flipper side. Its also got some nicelydesigned wedges that help protect the body and can be removed if necessary to help him drive off wedges more easily Ill cover both possibilities in this RP so be sure to tune in for that a heavy spinnerkilling plough on the back and the drives decent enough as well for a robot of his type. So yup lots of good things about his design to take into consideration and all of which will need to be nullified or taken advantage of accordingly. Fortunately though its still got a number of weaknesses to it that Dreadnought can take advantage of here. The most notable one is the huge reliance that Tellu has on the weapon. Although yes its very powerful and could easily be fatal if it hits just the wrong places hes evidently sunk a lot of his points into it with his fairly lacklustre stats everywhere else especially with regards to his drive and armour. So if you can stop it IE. Keeping him upsidedown and repeatedly forced to selfright with it instead of actually hitting me or at least figure out how to get past it then he doesnt have a great deal that he can fall back on to stop me very low armour aside from his rear scoop and even thats removable and with such low drive power and acceleration and only one way of selfrighting itll be extremely difficult for him to escape from me whenever Im underneath considering Im more than quick enough to follow up on any of his movements. This leads into one of the biggest advantages I have compared to his previous opponents the fact that I can effectively intercept the axe as it comes down. That is of course with my Flipper. Thanks to the WeaponArmour Bonus its armoured  thanks again Spatch! so that it can stand up to his weapon effectively enough especially since for the most part it wont be hitting directly mostly catching onto or above the angled top part and because its a fronthinged one theres no risk of him hitting any of the rams hinges or other important bits right at the bottom the best he can manage would be to push it back down since hes hitting it from the top but even that would leave him wide open to being wedged underneath and damaging them. So by firing the Flipper just before he fires his Axe itll stop it hitting the more vulnerable main body force his front end where his axe hinge is upward ergo simultaneously nullifying the axe and the front wedge and allow me to drive underneath and flip him. So that gives me a means of taking his biggest advantage and turning it into his biggest weakness. However he does also have his flipper to try and attack me with. Although yes this does sound like a better prospect for him on paper even this still has several flaws that will prevent it from being as effectively as hed like. Firstly its extremely narrow for a rearhinged flipping arm and its tip does not reach the end of the wedge which compromises its range considerably and opens him up to being baited into firing it too early. Further elaborating on that considering Dreadnought is designed to be able to be lifted up to high heights from the front and still move around effectively with its rear wheels that aids me significantly in doing so as if he flicks me up I can still reverse or jturn with how short and narrow it is respectively out the way drop back down and then still force my way underneath him before he can retract his weapon properly. And to that end he still must deal with the recoil from the weapon firing and would have trouble turning in time with his low traction and WD compared to my much faster and more agile WD to avoid getting broadsided if he does try switching between either side on the fly so theres that to take into consideration as well. Either side he tries to use I have a means of nullifying. Next up theres his wedges to consider. Although theyre welldesigned and especially wellsuited for taking on big spinners with theyre WD hinged wedges some of the weakest ones you can find in Fantasy Robot Combat so my WD wedge should be able to outprioritise them even without taking the recoil and approaches to getting underneath the guy using his weapon into consideration. Likewise theyre also quite shallow so as long as I stay out the way of the weapon they should be easy enough to simply reverse or jturn off of to escape on the offchance he does get underneath me instead. Theyre also big and clunky and if I am underneath and he does try driving off theyll get in the way of doing that and make it easier for me to keep him trapped. Furthermore the armour bonus on the scoop at the back reduces his  Armour down to a mere . Again good for spinners but its a complete downgrade against a fast flipper like Dreadnought since I can effectively focus any damaging attacks on places not including there and increases the chance of him breaking down from being flipped rammed and sent into the hazards repeatedly. So those too can be used against him here. But wait! Kody says. I can remove one or both of my wedges and make it easier for me to drive off Dreadnought like I did with Hellhound! That devious and handsome Brit will never see THAT one coming! Whilst this is a possibility and could help him in that regard it still comes with its own set of disadvantages. The main one is that it cuts down the effectiveness of his weaponry considerably Ill be able to angle around the Flipper side much more easily with how thin it is and the lack of wedges on the sides thus can be nullified by approaching it from any angle other than headon and with regards to the Axe Ill be able to get in much closer with the Flipper and fire it closer to the shaft further reducing its effectiveness and pushing him further upward as I get under. And either side it opens up the possibility of me being able to attack more aggressively by swooping straight under when I have a chance to attack from the sides or corners. And even if he can drive over wedges more easily with the lack of ones himself to get in the way its still going to be very difficult for him considering my bigger and wider wedge complete with the cobrahoods to stop him from simply driving off the side polycarbonate strip on top to keep him from monstertrucking over and the fact Im considerably faster more agile and with stronger torqueacceleration so I can simply copy his movements to keep him trapped. So regardless of whether or not he has the wedges equipped hes going to have a bad time. Theres also his selfrighting and how he takes getting flipped to take into consideration. As everyone knows one of the best designs to beat a powerful hammer with is with a wellarmoured flipper because they can get in flip it and keep it on its back and prevented from using the flipper. So of course Im going to want to keep him that way as much as possible constantly forced to selfright and waste gas which he could be using for his axe. Speaking of that he can only do it in one direction forward so I can always hang around near the direction in which hell land or ram into him to actively interfere with his attempts to recover after being flipped to set him up for flipping him back over and manoeuvring him towards the hazards or better still the OOTA Zone.  Even if he does land a hit or two on me directly its not the end of the World. My  Armour is still strong enough to stand up to the axe at least a few times and even then those areas are hard to get at with a weapon of his type considering most of my upper body is taken up with the armoured flipper which of course has the armoured additional plating underneath it as seen in Dreadnoughts picture thus essentially two layers of armour for that area of the machine for which the pneumatics and other crucial things are centred in an area near the bottom of the wedge that hell find extremely difficult to hit with the axe so that does give me more of a chance to survive even if he does land a direct hit. Not that I aim to let him but you cant be too careful! Finally theres the drive stats to consider. As mentioned Im not only much faster at  compared to his  top speed I have twice his traction so Ill be by far the more agile and manoeuvrable fighter and three times his torque so not only will I completely dominate any pushing matches Ill also be able to go as fast at minimum as he can go flatout. So again if he tries driving off the wedge Ill just be over him like mustard on a hot dog. So overall? Although Tellus a deadly opponent for anyone to face its still the archetypal glass cannon its capable of doling out lots of punishment with its powered axe but if you can get round the weapon somehow then it becomes a heck of a lot more vulnerable with the thin armour and the fairly lacklustre drive stats. So thats what Im going to take advantage of actively stopping him from bringing his weapon into play forcing him offguard and then doing everything I can to take advantage of it from there.,RpRoomFBB,db1nz7q,1,t5_3962h

10312723,0,t3_5nkpwt, Its pretty obvious that Powerdrive will want to keep its front facing Ecstasy and go for KOs. There are two reason that I think it wont work first Ecstasy has four parts and second each part is faster than Powerdrive. Diamond attack formation! KaPow will take the lead. and turn right. The other three will go left. I basically want to dangle one little robot in from of him and have it use its superior speed to keep him chasing it. Thatll allow the others to flank it flip it and then keep flipping it. People do the chaining flip strategy with one robot. With two it can be really effective. Ive got four. four. four.  Just dont give him the chance to selfright or settle onto his wheels. Keep turning him over to smash his disc into the floor. If he gets away chase him down bait him with one flank and continue flipping. For reference it should look kind of like this I want to flip him upwards of fifty times if I can. Going for the flip record here. If I have him totally under control Ill try for an OOTA but flipping him up on the screws or spike strips and then getting Crash who has a stronger flipper to doubleteam him with one of the others whoevers closest. If it doesnt work then just keep flipping. If he doesnt take the bait then just surround him flank him and flip him. Regardless of what happens always make the bot that hes targeting run away using its better speed. Stay away from hazards. If any of the clusters get flipped selfright if its safe or drive away first and then selfright if it isnt.  If he hazard baits Ill position two parts of the cluster on each side to cover his escape routes and drive them towards him. Hell have to drive over the hazards or attack one group. The group that he attacks will back away and the other group will come up behind him and flip him. Then the retreating group can advance again and resume chaining flips. If one or two of the clusters die because writers cant resist killing little robots then keep up the same strategy with three or even two. If theres only one left just run and survive. I dont think there will be unless he has some amazing strategy or I really mess up though. Good luck TBR! I hope Powerdrive does really well.,RpRoomFBB,dcd04st,1,t5_3962h
