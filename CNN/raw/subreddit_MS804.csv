7681416,0,t1_d3f4d6w,PKAXC did come down in much shallower water than AF or MS.Im not diminishing the challenges of search at depth but the proximity of the aircraft Last Known Position to the impact point is important for any underwater search.AF FGZCP transmitted its location at  minute intervals so its position could only be estimated within a nmkm radius of the last known location resulting in a potential km search area.The positions of SUGCC and PKAXC were fixed by ATC secondary surveillance at the top of their final descent. SUGCC has apparently been tracked by Hellenic Air Force radar during the descent. The estimate of impact point will be within a limited radius of the LKP and the seabed search area much smaller s of km rather than s.Ill have to pass on maintaining a table cant commit to time for updates.,MS804,d3fbwnv,2,t5_3eoam
7705111,0,t3_4krmh4,Im just very confused by what has apparently happened here. First this happened then it didnt.  Then that happened except it might not have done.  And so on.All we are seeing is endless conjecture and contradiction.  This is obvious foul play of some kind but what?  No terror outfits have claimed responsibility  they would have done by now.,MS804,d3i0q4d,2,t5_3eoam
7736120,0,t1_d3ldbq1,Yes it is. Im not into conspiracy but more about dodgey reporting and misinterpretation of data. Finding an ELT signal so late I quite odd. ,MS804,d3ljhv8,1,t5_3eoam
