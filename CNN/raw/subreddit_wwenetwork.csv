I think they are trying to feature shows on the timeline of several countriesif that makes sense.  In doing so though they are turning more people away.  All of this repetition of programming is fine if they were releasing content that just stayed on demand but they are not currently interested in bolstering their content unless they feel its programming which is suitable to air on the live stream.

I personally was enticed by it being ad free. As Netflix is....which I see you were so quick to jump at questioning my maturity and fandom that I guess theres no mentioning them. Netflix produces its own content. Its own comedy specials documentaries tv shows etc.Netflix had the idea of raising rates etc. once a few years ago people got all uppity and Netflix paid for it.And Netflix eventually raised prices two years later to what WWE Network costs now and only raised rates for new customers. In fairness I do understand that Netflix has a much larger install base but the principle doesnt change.The market serves us. Thats all Im saying. You and Mr. DontGiveADamn can be passive or we can all try to make this product service us in the best way possible.And in my opinion that serves the fandom much better. Anyways.

2965888,0,t1_co4h11l,Theres no way youre right.WWE staked their entire existence on the success of Network.  They burned their PPV distribution bridges and those can never be reforged as strong as they were.The amount of money WWE gets if people dont watch Raw doesnt change.  Thats a contract we have no influence over.  It would hurt them next time their TV contract was up but thats not for a long time and there would be  noticeable change in the short run.  Live events and merch is a big revenue stream but more fans dont participate in those than do and I dont think a few empty seats is going to hurt them that much.The Network is the most direct way of saying you are dissatisfied with the product.  You arent just not attending something or not buying something you are cancelling something.  You are taking time to tell them they cant have your money and why.  Whereas not buying merch is not putting money into their pockets cancelling Network is taking money out of their pockets.  There is a huge psychological difference in those things the latter being much more powerful.,wwenetwork,co58jb7,2,t5_2zphb

Theyre really afraid that fanssubscribers are much more interested in the video archives  when bytheway the product was more appealing  than the current product which is really very hard to digest for mark fans.Dissapointing!They deleted a LOT of stuff from youtube and dailymotion but they really failed to supply a satisfactory alternative on their Network.Seems they are really afraid that fans would rather watch the older content the archives than the current product!    If Vince is decison maker on what is loaded on the Network and what is posponed or left for later... one can easily bet hes interested in leading fans to the current product rather than delivering the old video archives.Maybe its also a technical issue  simply the servers may not withstand too much content viewd at once... who knows...

Hes a bad ass heel on TV and hes Mr. Nice Guy on the Network. I dont get it. And what some of these people like Witherspoon and such have to do with WWE I have no idea. Im all for expanding the Network and all but were already watching it. Its not like a free preview of HBO where a single moment may entice you to buy for at least a month. I just dont get why Renes show is on the network and not on Youtube.,wwenetwork,cqtj8eu,1,t5_2zphb
3840232,0,t3_34eq5z,I dont mind all that much they just need to do it in the same way as NetflixAmazon Prime etc. You get the first days free from whenever you sign up. But to keep shouting about it like they do April Is Free May Is Free. It comes across as really desperate like begging people to sign up. It also reeks of We know our show goes in the tank after every Wrestlemania and none of the PPVs are worth watching until Money In The Bank so hey we may as well give it away for free.And yes whilst Im fine with paying . for the service. I can understand how others could get annoyed that new subscribers dont have to pay for the month. Shouting about it over and over could be quite insulting to those existing subscribers.Instead of giving the network away for free why not make your product more exciting and keep adding new content that people actually want to see? Make people feel like theyre missing out by not subscribing.    ,wwenetwork,cqu0qh7,10,t5_2zphb
3842100,0,t1_cqu0yb9,Youre not paying for the free members. Youre paying for the service just as many of those free members will once their free month is over. This is a model that has been used by every subscription service imaginable and its an effective one for growing the subscriber base. The free month is there to attract new subscribers and it works. This is nothing but a good thing for the network because more subscribers  more money coming in  more and better content  better value for that  youre spending. If everyone did what youre suggesting there would be no network at all. So yeah you could just keep signing up new accounts and getting the service for free but why would you want to actively contribute to a possible failure of the network? Dont you want it to succeed and grow? ,wwenetwork,cqu8eqc,6,t5_2zphb
3849826,0,t3_34ioy0,I only watch mostly Attitude era stuff so I dont notice any edits. And this is coming from someone thats quite anal about this stuff. Im just glad the shows arent butchered down to  hour  minutes like WWE  and DVD releases.On the main channel though all the blood in black and white really annoys me on the Countdown shows and whatnot. They claim they dont allow bleeding because of diseases and whatnot but when it does happen they avoid showing it. And BampW older stuff. ,wwenetwork,cqv45kw,4,t5_2zphb
3898241,0,t3_352tyo,I enjoyed it. I understand them cutting the Curb Stomp the way they did since theyve banned it or are at least discouraging it. But it was very jarring and took me out of the show for a second.It was well produced as all of these WWE  shows have been and most of their documentaries in general are.The only real complaint I have is that this is the type of stuff they should have been doing for him before Wrestlemania. And yes I understand they wanted to include Mania as the final part of the show. But building him up as a person beyond the Vinces Boy idea that most of the fans had of him. Perhaps they could have followed the rehab from his hernia operation and stopped after Fast Lane or something like that.  It may not have prevented him being booed by most fans but it couldnt have hurt either. ,wwenetwork,cr0mt9o,1,t5_2zphb

3962862,0,t3_35s3s4,I began about four months ago with the earliest Old School card and have worked my way steadily through almost everything up to October  most of which Id never seen before. I really enjoyed World Class and the Starrcades. TNT was a bit of a mixed bag it got better when it cut its running time in half. I had to give up Prime Time Wrestling as I just wasnt enjoying it. Much as I want to make this marathon as complete as possible Im not going to force myself to watch something Im really not enjoying.Im not sure that I have favourite wrestlers from this period but there are a few guys that have stood out for me. Brutus Beefcake is interesting as he seems to improve with almost every appearance. At the point Im watching hes a heel allied with Greg Valentine and Luscious Johnny Valiant and I think working with two veterans genuinely seemed to rub off on Brutus. Its a shame that it all went downhill after he got friendly with Hogan.The other one whos surprised me is Lanny Poffo. Previously Id only known him as The Genius from early s WWF. So to see him in the ring is a real eye opener. If hed been born  years later I think he could have been a much bigger star than he was.,wwenetwork,cr8001i,1,t5_2zphb

He is top of the pile for all of what it takes to be Sports Entertainer. Charity work corperate face of the company. He learnt to speak Chinese FFS! Who learns a tricky language just to help the company gain a new market? He is great on the mic and in the ring too. However his ring work can suffer if hes not feeling it. There were several years when he was just phoning it in if he didnt have a good story or a lackluster opponent. Anyone remember the five moves of doom? Every match was a cooky cutter show. You knew exactly what was going to happen and the order it was going to happen in. There is a reason why half the crowd boo him even if today its mainly habit. He is truly great but not the greatest.,wwenetwork,dfcfuvd,1,t5_2zphb
