954784,0,t1_chcs7sv,Might as well give you the run down for most drugs. Due to Salvia being very easy to come by due to its legality in most places I can only recommend higher X amounts or smoking more. Salvia needs A LOT of heat to reach the melting point of salvinorin A roughly F and to get the full effects. Using a torch lighter will help or if you have one a vaporizer like the Volcano which heats up to F.   Other recommendations such as DMT and its variants Ayahuasca MeODMT ACODMT etc. since its arguably the best of the best. You could also achieve this effect on LSDNBOMe as well generally around ug for me but of course it differs from person to person. Most people will argue that ego death on acid is not worth it and can be a little too much to handle considering the effects from LSD last way longer. Which in my opinion they are right! Shrooms can also give you the feeling of ego loss but no where near the degree of LSDDMTSalvia from my experience. If you decide to take the shroom route heroic doses of  grams will get you there. But like I said its different person to person. ,Salvia,chctfn3,2,t5_2qvzt

1566661,0,t1_cjcngsk,alright dude thats a fair response. given the context now i was being harsh.problem is drugs like salvia and dmt are the most potent psychedelics known to man and weve got kids coming around all the time clearly having done zero research on them and thus using them irresponsibly...and thats why they get banned. so it annoys me personally when i come across people who arent willing to do proper research on them before using. that said i believe your story and it essentially exempts you from the group of people who normally annoy me. so apologies and have a good one.,Salvia,cjcnkk1,1,t5_2qvzt

2393706,0,t1_cm6r3mx,gtFirstly Ive broken through during almost every salvia trip Ive ever had and theyve all been utterly incredible magical times. Going to salvia land for me is like going to a secret place that holds more meaning and purpose than any place the physical world offers. The incredible feelings of nostalgia deja vu wonder awe and euphoria are almost too much for me to handle.What was the situationritualsdoses you got to achieve that?

2720571,0,t1_cnd9slm,ah didnt quite get that. but the edge of my bed became really profoundly important for some reason. I was staring at it and it was like a split in reality. I was alone in the room but in my mind I was talking to other people hearing voices and the such. Such as my bedroom door which I sincerely believed was my mum she wasnt angry just having a chat.Salvia is apparently more accurately described as a psychotomimetic rather than a psychedelic it simulates what some schizophrenics are going through  and mental health is something that fascinates me. So it was an experience Im glad Ive got under my belt but its not something Ill seek out again any time soon. Im glad I didnt have a bad trip and enjoyed the thrill of it  but as I was coming down and reality began to reassert itself I then came to comprehend how potent the experience must have been at its height. I became slightly unsettled at this point because if an experience as powerful as that was to turn bad eg due to anxiety or emotionally negative delusions like dying it would be so profoundly nightmarish I would be traumatised for a long time afterwards.,Salvia,cndbfj7,2,t5_2qvzt

The salvia trip is only supposed to last a brief amount of time mine lasted nearly four hours. Lsd   ug tabs from the dark net  definitly enhanced it.

3268547,0,t3_2xilbj,You should examine the plant for any foreign organic objects like an egg sack from insects or larvae that might be eating it. Check under all the leaves and on every part of the stems to see if you find anything suspicious that could be the culprit. I would also suggest cutting off the majorly dried leaves to help it save some energy. Lastly consider getting it a larger pot with some fresh soil and see if that helps it out. If worse comes to worse you can cut it at each node and root the cuttings to have several new clones. I hope your plant recovers well!,Salvia,cp0uafe,1,t5_2qvzt
