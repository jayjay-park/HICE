162962,0,t3_1vx5y3,If I were in your position I would do the followingI would go to the dealer of my choosing being sure to walk with a purposeful stride and confidence even if it is a bluff!. I would then tell the salesman that I would like to purchase an Automatic FRS in the color of my choosingIf they tried to steer me away from the car I would first be gentle and direct. I would tell them thanks for the offer but I have my heart set on the FRS and I do not want any car. If met with resistance I would next politely point out that I will be leaving if I cannot be helpedSame applies to optionstransmission. I would keep my cool and let them know what I want.Important I would follow through and leave. If no other dealer works out I would come back and try one more time the next day at roughly the same timeI think the most important part is the confidence. I wouldnt feed into any suggestions they make but instead keep saying no and repeating what I wanted.Im not sure of your situation but it may help your confidence and minimize the dealers sidetracking to have an older man accompany you. Father is a good bet but any older gentleman would help in my opinion. Good luck  I promise the car is worth all the pain ,ft86,cewzsiu,2,t5_2t4rq

603577,0,t1_cg8vjtw,Definitely recommend learning in a safe environment and much more so recommend autocross. At an autocross event there are people watching you so you can focus on going fast while being safe.  Means things like traction control get in the way without safety being a concern. Courses are setup with people losing control in mind.  Safety stewards review tracks to make sure you have room when you do have an oh shit moment.Neither of those happen on the streets.

789208,0,t1_cgtsnmp,You want to blame me for relying on speedfactorys promise even though I specifically indicated the manner of ordering amazon and the manner of shipping standard.  Thats fine you seem to think that speedfactory is unreliable about their business and I shouldnt trust their word I now agree with you after my experience.  If I had placed the order via twoday shipping I wouldnt have called to confirm if it would get here by friday since the shipping option would guarantee it.  I called to see if the standard option would actually get here by friday and was told it would in no uncertain terms.  What about this is confusing for you?  If they had said as they should have the standard shipping times could take up to a week so you should order faster shipping.  I would have done so and I would have no problem whatsoever with speed factory. I have  problems with them currently.  They told me that the product would arrive by Friday via standard shipping and it arrived  days later.   They told me the product would go out in Mondays mail around noon my time and they didnt even print the shipping label until tuesday at  and it didnt arrive at the post office until  on Tuesday.  When I called them to explain the problem they like you failed to acknowledge that they made a mistake tacitly blamed me for relying on their shipping representations and offered nothing but hollow apologies sorry that happened instead of sorry we completely misinformed you.  For comparison that same day Monday I also ordered an arcade machine part via amazon from a supplier in Hawaii using standard shipping that part arrived Thursday.   I ordered floor mats from a supplier on amazon with standard shipping that same day as well that part arrived Tuesday.  I ordered some audio video cables from a company in New Jersey half a country further away from me than Iowa again with standard shipping and got that part on Friday.  Note that none of these orders were actually fulfilled by Amazon.  But I get it you dont think speed factory should be accountable for what they tell their customers.

One of their seats costs  as our cost before shipping from their distribution to our shop and MSRP is about . Their mandated policy allows us to sell that seat at the  price range. If we drop any lower and the seat company finds out about it we lose our dealer privileges.This is sometimes in other industries too why products get marked up right before a huge sale. They dont get likeminded customers complaining about how bullshit a  sale is.

Now that Ive had the car for  months she has fallen in love with it and frequently tells people about it when were out and theyre curious and how it is soooo much more practical than my previous car.  Her main talking points it has a backseat! the backseat has room for future car seats for future kids and it will be very far in the future it has a surprisingly spacious trunk the back seat folds down if longer items are needing transport I was volunteered to take her stepdad to the airport for his ski trip.My point is practicality is different for different people.  ,ft86,cp1ejzw,3,t5_2t4rq

3369553,0,t3_2xkdd3,They run the engine itself at redline at the factory anyway its called a hot test.  They do it again after vehicle assembly on a dyno.  It helps test the engine and seats the rings which like a lot of force at first.  At the company I work at engineering job we hot test all our engines for the same reason.  You will want to get an early oil change for a new car as the bearings wear in super quick at first as they sort of get to know eachother and wear into place.  This deposits a lot of wear metals in the oil pretty quick.I didnt break mine in I just took it easy on the clutch for the first  miles.  I got over mpg before I switched to better tires which dropped a few mpgs but made the car better in every way.  Im at  miles with few issues other than that God damned hail damage I need to get repaired.  The Japanese engineering mentality is very conservative.  They are amazing at what they do but often have a hard time letting go of some standards and practices.  Its my opinion that this break in cycle is a product of that.

It looking ricey to some is probably due to the burnt tips but also keep in mind unlike the other exhausts that have a burnt tip this rest of the exhaust is not stainless steel its titanium throughout the catback.

3799689,0,t3_33vpi1,If you think youll drive it in stock form for awhile then as far as Im concerned there are only two essentials Firstly you need to get the manual gearbox version because the clutch will set you free. Youll also probably want to remove the return spring from the clutch pedal which is pretty safe and easy to do.Second if you can help it only put pure ethanolfree gas in the tank. Its literally the only fuel type that the stock system was designed for. Get it and youll never worry about squeaking noises from the fuel pump. Its roughly  more expensive per gallon here and I go out of my way to get it but after suffering the crickets myself I think its worth the trouble. In fact Im sure the engine also sounds healthier idles more smoothly and gives a crisper throttle response. I mostly use  octane but when I cant get that the  seems to work fine.Everything else boils down to preference in my view. Just keep up on the regular maintenance and hose it down once in awhile shell treat you right.,ft86,cqpe78g,2,t5_2t4rq

The VSC does not send constant communication to the vehicle.gt Toyota  and Subaru BRZ cars must have the engine warmed up before the VSC can switch the ECU into maintenance mode to disabled TRC VSC and partially ABS. Furthermore in the event of an engine stall when warmedup starting the engine again with the VSC attached will cause the VSC to send a signal to the ECU again to maintain the maintenance mode continue to disable VSC TRC amp ABS.I thought thats what this indicated in the description.

Keeping the turbo closer to the exhaust ports on the block and utilizing UEL header design means it spools super quick but now that we are beefing up all of the other components  larger intercooler external wastegate had an issue with the internal WG hanging open on their turbo and wanted to go Ext. WG anyway larger throttle bodymatched piping Flex FuelE setup  we feel that the turbo is now the restriction for making more boost.  We feel we could get better flow on the top end without a drastic loss in response with these components and the properlysized larger turbo.  They Forged Performance are currently developing their own nocompromises inhouse turbo kit here that will have the flexibility to give the customer options for meeting various power delivery goals whether it be quick response or just enough for stock internals more boost for forged internals but stock trans or beyond that even if the drivetrain is built.  We will eventually be swapping over to that when its ready just wanted to see what this AVO had it in maxed out first.  Its their Stage  with billet compressor.If you end up getting one I have AVOs optional race intercooler here we took off and replaced with a monster AMS intercooler.

If you want to run zero camber you will need both LCAs and Camber Plates.. You can but it wont ride very well.  You have to have a drop to have the right range of articulation for the damper and suspension the FLZ  has a higher spring rate than stock so you have to drop a bit to stay in the nice part of the suspension travel range..

10408537,0,t1_dcnsgns,So a few lessons learned from my CPO purchase two months ago. Same year. Same color less than half the mileage. Maybe it will help you...CPO isnt what you think it is. It is NOT bumpertobumper and if you look carefully you will find no such wording in the brochures paperwork etc. Its actually LESS coverage than the factory warranty. Its intentionally vague because it covers almost nothing.I paid k more though. Jealous. My market is just expensive it seems. I still look around and see these going for high prices CPO. PAnyways mine was in an undisclosed accident I have the CarFax its clean though I did notice when I first saw it and now it was one owner before me and not two. Now there are two prior owners and one was for a period of three months. and I failed to inspect it properly because I figured Hey its CPO! Bad move on my part. Theres paint overrun on my weather stripping from where it was poorly masked orange peel where it was blended poorly and cracking of the paint along the drivers side door jamb that is beginning to chip. all of the damage is centered around the rear quarter panel which is welded to the frame. No impact damage but the paint just sucks.First week of ownership I snapped a wheel stud trying to remove a lug nut to put on winter wheels. It had been overtightened and stretched or crossthreaded by the tech who inspected me car. Either that or they never inspected it at all Which I am beginning to suspect because they left previous owner paperwork in and everything. At the same time I discovered a pinch weld near the front passenger wheel was caved in and bowing badly. Not great.They fixed both with the pinch weld getting reasonably better than expected repair. It was done out of their good will.The week after I got the car back I noticed damage on the bumper. A near puncture wound like the car had been backed into something. Asked to get it fixed denied. Called corporate and twisted their arm for the  bumper cover and paint it would take. All better. For now.Discovered recently they didnt put any bulbs in my license plate lights. Ive been driving around like that in ignorance.All of my issues are supposed to have been caught during inspection. All of them. Im pretty confident it got a onceover and nothing more.I ran an OBD scan on it myself and found no stored codes or anything so Im at least comfortable there. No signs of modifications but the cars first owner was a lessee.During this call to corporate they GUARANTEED me nothing. Wouldnt stand behind the CPO. Nothing. They told me it was totally up to the dealership and that they could only forward the case number and speak to them cordially. If the dealership declined it was on me to seek legal council. Thats literally it unless the issue is powertrain related then corporate has more pull.As I spend more time with the car go through its first wash three weeks in etc I start noticing things like everybody does which is the paint issue I mentioned above in paragraph three.I now have another appointment to get it assessed for the paint damage and hope they send it out to get cleaned up and fixed but thats all it is. Hope.Another call to corporate assured me that this is between me and the dealership and that they can provide no guarantee certainty or support that my issues will be addressed or even fixed.Buyer beware. You should have a grace period for returning the car so make sure you get an inchbyinch inspection done on that car. Look at every panel. Doublecheck the carfax. Do the flashlight test on the paint to check for respray etc. If its not right bring it up to them right away to get it addressed or you might regret it down the road.,ft86,dcnvj03,1,t5_2t4rq

The tire does have to squeeze back down to the width of wheel so a wider tire will end up with more bowed sidewalls and youll give up some responsiveness on turn in and transitions.
