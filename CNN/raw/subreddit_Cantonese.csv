3401844,0,t3_2z4hl4,Im from Canada  here theres Chinese schools that teach MandarinCantonese to students every Saturday. Its an Asian thing every Asian kid has to go through. I would also suppose that parents and especially grandparents would speak to their kids in Cantonese. Personally  I watch TVB dramas watch movies listen to HK music  and read books  but thats just because I am genuinely interested in the language. Some of my friends can also speak Cantonese  but its the horrible kind where all their tones are off. ,Cantonese,cpg1atg,3,t5_2wxkd

6122496,0,t3_3zejfn,You can mean mostly the same without .Using  at the end of a sentence indicates hesitation. rpseed is correct that its an important indicator of asking questions in the sense that the speaker is looking for an answer instead of an argument or apology.,Cantonese,cylkbhq,5,t5_2wxkd
6153993,0,t3_3zs7iy,gtDont they have light entertainment shows where semi famous people sit around bullshitting and maybe doing embarrassing challenges like a terento on Japanese TV? What could I search to find stuff like that?Super Trio Supreme Was my favourite even though I didnt normally watch TV.  No idea where youll find episodes of it online since theyve all been taken down.  No eng subs but they usually play the same games.,Cantonese,cyp586h,1,t5_2wxkd
6405170,0,t1_czhoog7,Yeah its really nice.   My biggest ongoing problem is vocabulary  obviously my boyfriend and his family have extensive vocabularies whereas I know a few hundred words and learn new ones slowly. So often times I cant tell exactly what they are talking about but I can get the gist from key words verbs time numbers food etc.  things I know well.,Cantonese,czhpb10,1,t5_2wxkd

7243142,0,t1_d21hgu5,I dont use jhuting or whatever you spell it as I never learned it. I cant do that  tones and whatever. I just approximate it as close as I could with whatever letters I got. If you have better pronunciation guide please add it so I can learn from it too. And since he sounds like hes a laowei they have to give him a lot of slack right?,Cantonese,d21hqwn,2,t5_2wxkd

7489323,0,t3_4htjto,One group that I am pretty interested in are those who live and grew up in Latin America. Ive interacted with a few and it was odd and very humbling. I usually go between Cantonese and English especially with kids but that obviously doesnt work with someone who speaks Cantonese and Spanish. ,Cantonese,d2thuv3,4,t5_2wxkd

8809964,0,t1_d76f5ao,gt Thanks! Ive heard of jaak ziu too but I always thought of it as eat bananas in a really mean way lolYeah a coworker explained that one to me when I offered her one of my breakfast bananas when she was starving.I assume those would be the equivalents of these English idioms Eat shit Eat shit and die. Go choke on it Go suck the big one another mans cockThe literal translations have no meaning if theres no cultural context in the case of bananas its the physical resemblance to perfectly formed fecal droppings.,Cantonese,d76u656,1,t5_2wxkd
8817796,0,t1_d77qez2,Taiwanese and Minnan Yu are pretty much the same language Of course there are many local dialects of Minnan Yu and Taiwan has their own accent and some local vocab too. About  of the population of Taiwan claims to have some proficiency in Taiwanese.
