2583835,0,t3_2pc6os,Another question Do you prefer streaming or LPs? I feel like youre more relaxed during streams but thats just how I see it.,TheRunawayGuys,cmvuf9c,2,t5_2ueqn
2968672,0,t3_2u5sxq,I would love to see some of the Wario games being played on the show. Wario World and Shake It being some of the best choices. I remember once Tim had D Dot Game Heroes as an upcoming LP but I dont think he followed through with it. Would be fun to see but I dont know if it would be really good for commentary. And there is always the Tales series even though they are  player coop. Pokemon would be interesting. Could have the three of you naming Pokemon and taking turns building a solid team. Any of the Sonic games are good choices.And if you want to play something terrible for any reason there is Ninjabread ManAnubis IITrixie in ToylandAny game by that company. Rachet and Clank can definitely fit the content of the show nicely. A personal favorite of mine that doesnt get enough love is Spongebob Squarepants Battle for Bikini Bottom. Its a collectathon in the same vein of Banjo Kazooie and its a surprisingly damn well made game at that as well. ,TheRunawayGuys,co5jwx7,3,t5_2ueqn
