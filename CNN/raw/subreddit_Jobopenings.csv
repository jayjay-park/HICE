3508150,0,t3_30fj26,Software Engineer here. I will never apply for another job that requires a pedantic coding interview. If youre hiring me to be a web developer then I am going to solve web developer problems. Additionally asking me these questions is incredibly insulting its why you run a backgroundexperience check so that you can verify I have a proven track record. Why do you think its so hard to hire an engineer when you have such bullshit metrics for the right hire? Id rather work on a team of shitty programmers that are awesome people than a team of awesome programmers who are shitty people.,Jobopenings,cps5k3s,1,t5_2s956

5597255,0,t3_3rrmy7,gtAbout Akuna  gtAkuna Capital is a fastgrowing derivatives trading firm located in downtown Chicago that specializes in marketmaking and arbitrage.Stop here. Thats all the information I need. ust like resumes people who you want to hire only look at these things for  seconds. gtFounded in  Akuna has quickly expanded from a startup to a successful leader on U.S. options exchanges and has already begun international expansion. In July of  Akuna opened a dedicated technology office in the Research Park of the University of Illinois. I dont care about your history this isnt an about us section. gt The office houses a blend of fulltime developers and student interns working on Akunas missioncritical systems.We were too cheap to hire full time developers so we have interns do our mission critical work. Well blame our full time developers for the interns innexperienced work. gt Weve grown significantly from humble but determined beginnings and still proudly retain the spirit of a smaller entrepreneurial startup.thats so web scale. Overall the About Akuna sectionTLDR Financial Trading software. gt Job Description  gtWe have an opportunity for a motivated developer to join our performance team and contribute to the buildout of our proprietary options marketmaking trading platform. Your role will focus on high performance data parsing and how we transfer data to make it more usable for the data analysts.Thats so packed with information only people inside your field actually know what it means. This could be summarized as Youll be making data go from one format to another because our data analysts dont know how to write their own SQL queries. gt What youll do as a C Developer at Akunagt  Data collection real time data parsing and data storage  Good bullet point. But data storage? like copying CSV files?gt  Implement high quality servicesServices? What kind? REST? God forbid SOAP. Some other proprietary communication standard?gt  Engage traders and developers and articulate ideas clearlySo you mean be able to talk to people? Good communication skills is important for any job. What you should say is Will have to work with people gt  Participate in design sessions and code reviewsSo you mean be a software engineer? gt  Work on crossfunctional teamsAgain must talk to people Must be able to work with other people. gt  Be mentored by Senior Developers to learn the trading system and domainThis is a big red flag. This means youre looking for a Junior Developer retitle the position and list the years of experience as  years. gt  Solve complex problems and troubleshoot issuesThis is unnecessary to list. Thats part of being a software engineer. gt Qualities that make great candidates  gt   years of experience in developing performant scalable applications in C and at least  years with CAs mentioned above youre really looking for a jr developer. gt  Experience with databases and data storage HDF and Elasticsearch preferredgt  Bachelors degree in Computer Science Engineering Math or equivalentExperience is experience even google doesnt hire people with engineering degrees. More often than not youll find UX designers with art degrees and they just got really good at coding.  If you do hire someone with computer science or engineering degree you should aim to skip  of your technical interview. Those pedantic questions like you have two eggs to drop off a building are a complete insult and waste of time. Hire them and fire them like you would any other job in any other position in any other organization. gt  Experience with concurrent programming e.g. multithreaded reactor etc.gt  Experience with multicore programming paradigmsI.e. has experience working web web stuff. gt  Understanding of distributed systems data structures and algorithmslike hell am I going to code my own hashmap from scratch. I hope to god you dont ask them that during the interview. gt  Understanding concepts of networking i.e. TCP UDP multicastare you looking for a network engineer? Because  of the time you dont need to worry down to the protocol level. I do understand for High performance computing it may be required but youd be wasting your engineering time rebuilding the wheel gt  Capable of writing unit tests and functional testsno one with  years of experience will have ever had experience writing unit tests. gt  Ability to break down large problems methodicallyi.e. think like a software engineer. Are you expecting them to code with emojis? gt  Experience with Linux and Pythonextremely vaguge. Overall Analysis of Position a lot of unnecessary fluff about the organization useless descriptions about the position. The title of the position should be changed to something along the lines of Junior Software Engineer C data processing because that accuratly describes both what youre looking for and what the actual position entails. The position would benefit from listing more tools and technologies that youre looking for in the position. there are a few but more is required Open source libraries are the lifeblood of a skilledexperienced software engineer often they will use that as the search terms for when looking for a job. JavaScript developers will look for things like node or Angular whereas C developers will look for Boost or some other C library maybe some entity library...im no C developer so I wouldnt know ,Jobopenings,cwqw5g6,1,t5_2s956
