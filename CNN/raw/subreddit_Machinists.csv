172084,0,t1_cey0ekf,Its been a while since I did this but something like this in a metric program    G X Y Z. Rwill make a helix with a .mm pitch in Z. Stick some G in there and you can easily make a full thread in just a few lines of code. A protip for thread milling if youre unfamiliar with it is to start at the bottom of the thread then machine it in Z. Last time I used this was when I had to make some deep mm holes so I used a mm endmill and just helixed it to the finished diameter in one pass. Almost as quick as drilling but with a nicer surface finish and it makes a rounder hole  without having to mess with boring it.,Machinists,cey172i,3,t5_2s1ie

EDIT On further inspection I think the larger part at the top is actually stationary as part of the head. And the thinner part with the chuck on the end is the quill. Which could be to provide support to the quill while still leaving access to the morse knockout. But I havent worked with many drill presses that large. ,Machinists,ckktvpx,1,t5_2s1ie

NOPE. After my apprenticeship was up I interviewed at about  local companies who told me that they do not promote off the floor as a matter of policy. Machinists are considered disposable expendable and unskilled.The worst was that after that apprenticeship I interviewed with the manager for all the engineers at my plant. He told me Why would I hire you when I have college kids who come here from Wentworth Institute of Technology as interns and I get to testdrive them for six months?. Guess where I went for Computer Science before I transferred out to save money? Wentworth.Now. Being a machinist is a fun job. I enjoy it. But it grates knowing that Ive peaked before Im .

4144343,0,t1_crsmcr6,The natural frequency of that blob by a rough guesstimate is around Hz.  Most forced vibrations in milling applications are typically above this frequency rpms   teeth    Hz self excited vibrations are even higher hz so I dont think its causing too many issues on that end.  Youre right that increasing mass will lower the natural frequency of the system but the overriding factor is the stiffness of the system.  That blob in the back will bring the center of gravity of the system closer to the column.  However what effect that has on overall performance I do not know keep in mind I only claimed that it will affect performance not how it will affect it.  If youre so inclined you could always make a rough model of a beam supported in the middle vs a cantilevered beam and what affect that has on the stiffness and natural frequency of the system.  More mass is good is generally the rule of thumb in machining systems although that comes with the caveat that the mass is used to increase stiffness.,Machinists,crso7ku,1,t5_2s1ie

I think youre right in blaming the Dremel. If you can wiggle the endmill around that much by hand a slot milling operation is going to be a complete pain. Speaking of which a two flute endmill could help a lot.Another option worth investigating is fitting a CNC spindlerouter instead of the Dremel. Ebay says you can have a kit for about a hundred bucks. I dont know if thats within your budgetliking but will go a very long way in fixing your rigidity problem.Ive looked for a grinding attachment but didnt find anything reasonably priced so I think a routerspindle used for DIY CNC machines is a better option.,Machinists,cw7d801,2,t5_2s1ie

It takes the input voltage converts it to DC and converts it to  pseudo sinewaves using pulse width modulation.The reason you can use a VFD to run v motors is because you can run  phase motors on  different voltages usually v on delta and v on wye. Your motor seems to run on vv. That is if your terminals look like thisA quick search on v to v transformers resulted nothing assuming you can even run a  VFD on one input phase.So yeah x to x VFD  new motor is your safestcheapest bet in my opinion unless someone else has a better idea.,Machinists,czta7ft,1,t5_2s1ie

This makes setting jobs up a much bigger PITA. This key fits in the door interlock so the machine thinks the door is closed and the operator has full control.

If youre turning an OD on the lathe you should put it on the OD of the part Or the tip of the tool but OD is usually easier. If youre milling a face it should be on the face of the part Same caveat applies. If youre drilling a hole its a little trickier it needs to get to the bottom of the hole where the tip of the drill is actually cutting. Usually easiest to put it on the tip of the drill. Though having some on the sides of the drillhole is usually nice for general lubrication.Have you really never seen the difference in a cut with and without oil?

10504894,0,t1_dcyrds2,Heres a bad explanation from another touristYoure looking at what used to be a collet.  Collets hold round things for machines either tools or the work piece itself. You get collets of different diameters to hold different things.  Collets come in different styles and tapers but usually want the thing you put in them to be round. Heres a picture of a box of collets Collets have those  cuts in them because they squeeze together around the tool or work when pressure is applied to the flange.  The  pieces in OPs picture are all supposed to be together in one piece.  Based on OPs explanation I think what happened is they decided that the front face where the splits are needed to be less big.  So the put it in a machine lathe to make it smaller.  A lathe is a machine that spins a workpiece the collet in this case then a stationary nonrotating tool is applied to it to make cuts.  A mill is the opposite  the tool rotates and the work moves against it.  Lathes are good at making round things mills are good at making square things this is a gross over generalization.  Anyway despite their best efforts to secure the work when they tried to cut it with a tool on the lathe the collet did not like it and decided to throw a fit and turn into  different pieces.  I think what happened is the tool caught the split section and grabbed onto it resulting it a lot of force in a direction that the collet did not enjoy.  It is no longer functional as a collet which was not the intended result of putting in the lathe.  Also the front face is still the same length which is also bad.,Machinists,dcyuaro,9,t5_2s1ie

Some  uin surfaces noted. The part is rough cast which universally never casts with better than a  uin finish.  If youre making the part to print without knowing better you now have to machine every surface  which will add say six hours of runtime and over the course of one job will push your delivery date back a week. If you know what the part is for and how its used you know which surfaces are extraneous and that you can technically violate print and leave ascast. You cut two whole setups off your process save six hours per part make your boss happy and make the shop more money by having a higher ontime .I dont think machinists can afford to be close minded and just run stuff exactly as written without thinking about it.

11422331,0,t1_dfqiz36,Exactly. I used to run and oversee one machine in our shop that is very large. Dont remember the numbers exactly but something along the lines of xx. We just completed a job that the raw casting had to be setup with a Z height of . it was over K lbs. We had to actually put tools inside the center bore of the part with the crane and then pick them with the machine because of Z travel considerations.Another example is we had to remove guarding and covers to machine a part on Saturday. Next part is  wider.,Machinists,dfqpk5h,9,t5_2s1ie

11651833,0,t1_dggqey4,First get out of surface grinding and get into milling andor turning. Study how parts are being cut how theyre being held cutter choice speeds and feeds used etc. Ask questions and take notes. Take a couple of years and become a very good operator.After that pick some CAM software and start doing some research. Eapprentice.net is a good resource fairly cheap and you get a student version of mastercam. At least you did a few years ago.Once you have a handle on the how of machining parts thats really when you can start programming. I recommend Mastercam because its the most prevalent software at least where Im at.,Machinists,dggqztu,3,t5_2s1ie

11694960,0,t1_dgln4bv,gt Its been a little while since Ive done it and always had a template to do it with. But it was along the lines of gt X Z last turning point R radius and direction Cant remember the angle identifierfollowed by x z points for end of the angled sectionX Z Next turning geometry gt I think it was a J but dont quote me. It was that easy.   Always run a graphic or dry run because if it didnt work right off you had to flip the value of R and or J due to being more than a  degree radius and angle direction. You could also use it when defining canned roughing and finishing cycles so it was super easy to hammer stuff out. gt Okumas apps engineer would know right off hand I bet.  uDeepSkull,Machinists,dgln4gw,1,t5_2s1ie
