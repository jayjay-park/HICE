7855185,0,t1_d3xk4mb,hmm capitalization really matters.  I just checked on an address and the explorer gave the correct answer.You can also try in the terminal that walletapp is running in balance Fa...  it should show a nonzero balance.To really test the paper wallet I would load up walletapp on an offline computer with networking disabled and no hard drive.  I would boot linux from a CD copy walletapp onto a thumbdrive and copy it to the offline computer.   After removing the thumbdrive I would run walletapp after doing chmod x .walletapp then in the walletapp import the Fs... key.  It should show the same public key as is written on the paper wallet.,factom,d3yzsb7,1,t5_33ivn
