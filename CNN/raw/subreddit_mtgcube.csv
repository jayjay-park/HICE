63079,0,t3_1usukw,Do you know why you want ? I will second what Chizarlicious said and recommend starting with a smaller cube.  I started with a  card cube but usually only draft with  people.  I have since gone down to a  card cube and have been having better experiences.  A smaller cube means you can support archetypes more easily because it will be more likely that specific cards will be in your pool.More general advice regardless of size is to just start building.  One thing I have learned is that a cube is never done it is always evolving.  When I first built my cube I went through my collection and added all the cards I liked.  Red white aggro was the winning deck  drafts in a row.  I set out to make the other colors stronger by looking at a lot of cube lists and adding cards that looked good.  Just about every time we draft now there are a few small changes here and there.  tldrThe best way to build a cube is just to put it together draft and revise.,mtgcube,celm0k8,2,t5_2smkx

I prefer a more subtle approach to blue aggro than simply all of the cheapest creatures blue can get its hands on Phantasmal Bear? Blech.. Even in an aggressive deck blue is still mostly about support and getting a cheap threat down and protecting it with your other spells. Blues cheap threats are awesome in that they either provide fuel for its own protection Looter ilKor Tandem Lookout Mulldrifter disrupt your opponent ManoWar Vendilion Clique Sower of Temptation Riftwing Cloudskate etc. or are much cheaper for their size than you would normally expect in blue Serendib Efreet Phantasmal Image Wake Thrasher.

If I send you a  pack and you send me a  pack one of us is not going to be happy. I would suggest a  target. Cards that constantly get cut from decks are usually super cheap for the same reason that they constantly get cut from decks. Boosters should be tailored to the recipients format and style of choice. If you are a pauper player then you dont want my junk rares. If you are a Spike then you probably dont want drop creatures.

1135303,0,t1_chxabcz,Im the same way but to kind of go off topic..I also dont like it when two cards are  similar just one has that extra something to push it just over the other.In the case of Savannah Lions and Elite Vanguard I wont run Savannah Lions because there is nothing in my cube that would make it better to have a creature with the Cat type over Human Soldier. Another would be that I cant bring myself to run Jackal Pup anymore now that Firedrinker Satyr exists.I think mainly my problem is that I dont want to use a card when a strictly better version of it also exists in the cube. I want each card to be separately unique and worthwhile to pick.This ideology works very hard against me though in most cases. When Mana Confluence was spoiled I really wanted to play both it and City of Brass but could not bring myself to unless there exist situations for both where it would be better to have the other instead. Thankfully I found them p. Mana Confluence can be tapped down by Icy Manipulator all day and it wont hurt you at all. City of Brass was a bit more tricky but you can Lightning Bolt someone to the face at  life and still win with CoB whereas you cant with MC.Huge tangent I apologize.

I started originally with  of every common and uncommon and  of every rare and mythic and then Id shuffle in rarities and distribute  commons  uncommons and  rare or mythic shuffled up together to each pack.  The benefit to this is that its statistically a lot closer to a real draft.As I did this more I realized a few things...  its a pain in the ass to store one of these for each set.  Its usually  cards in the cube and I have many of these sets. people are still pissed when they get shitty unplayables like search the city.  so I went to bestiares draft lists and started reducing the  of cards on the bottom end.  some have lower s and some are so unplayable that ive removed them entirely.  i cut the rares amp mythics down to  of each and removed most of the jank rares search the city the ultrahighcosted doesnt actually win the game but if youre playing it in the right EDH deck will cards.,mtgcube,ci0mdw7,2,t5_2smkx

2223779,0,t3_2klgtp,There are my favorite threads! Getting a sticky one until a couple weeks after release date would be nice otherwise we will have three or four of these guys running around.    These are the cards I have considered so far    Jazal Goldmane  Solid body that wins combat often. Also has a pretty powerful anthem effect. Sadly the anthem isnt worth the expense so something like Hero of Bladehold is going to win out. I dont run Calciderm but if I did I would probably cut that for Jazal.    Teferi Temporal Archmage  A very expensive planeswalker. Probably not worth the . Probably combos with something I cant think of right now.    Flesh Carver  It can get big fast especially with Gravecrawler Bloodsoaked Champion and Bloodghast around. On its own its a bit weak but if you can get one free sacrifice out of it with a return guy I think its actually very strong.    Malicious Afflication  The double doom blade. Its probably close enough to doom blade to warrant an inclusion though it is much much harder to cast.    Ob Nixillis of the Black Oath  Basically just generates s at a decent rate. Does have some build around status but sometimes you just hit people over th ehead with something. I expect I will cut Bloodline Keeper for him.    Dualcaster Mage  This card is pure value. My dream is to float  and then cast this copying a stoke the flames or Fireblast but it can also work in most any deck. I think its an obvious inclusion.    Feldon of the Thrid Path  This card is a very interesting fist pick build around and is like a fixed version of KikiJiki. Its probably a little underpowered for cube but the card is very cool and I would never fault someone for playing it.    Freyalise Llanowars Fury  In the same realm as Garruk Primal hunter. Her main advantage over Garruk is that she has higher loyalty and will more often stay in play. She also can destroy certain problem permanents whereas Garruk just hopes for the best. Of course Garruk can draw cards right away. Again very comparable but I expect I will make the swap just becuase she is easier to cast and thus more likely to be drafted and for nosalgia.,mtgcube,clmhupi,3,t5_2smkx
2238988,0,t3_2ksd0s,How feasible would it be to give Cogwork Librarian its intended functionality in draft?

2240199,0,t1_clo13hm,Cloudgoat will generally just blank your opponents moves for a turn or beat the hell out of them. I removed him for a while but he was quickly returned because hes just that powerful.Dusk Urchins is pretty strong. Hes basically always a  Phyrexian Rager or a lightning rod. My black section is very value heavy as I find that over supporting aggressive black usually leads to black being ignored by half the table and splashed for removal whereas the valueheavy identity has lead to more people drafting black as a base color.I greatly despise Vexing Devil as I think its basically Lava Spike if you draw it early and if you draw it late your opponent can ignore it. Outside of allin red its pretty bad and with limited slots to work with I want as many of my spells to pull double duty so Im not enforcing any particular archetype.I like Krosan Grip because its unique. Green doesnt get a lot of ways to outplay you so the pure brute force of Grip is one of the few methods to get your opponent. It hoses Jitte Disk Oblivion Stone Icy Manipulator Pernicious Deed etc. Most removal spells are pretty awkward vs those cards but not Grip. I also run Reclamation Sage Indrik Stomphowler and Acidic Slime so its not like I need another effect with a body.,mtgcube,clokzmw,1,t5_2smkx

Be careful you dont include a card that leads your drafters in a direction where they wont find enough support.  You want each creature to stand on its own merits.Ghoulraiser isnt terrible but Id consider better zombies to support it.  Diregraf Ghoul Gravecrawler Skinrender Carnophage all come to mind.Elves isnt too difficult either  just go deep on the mana elves.  Fyndhorn Elves Llanowar Elves Elvish Mystic etc.  Then have a couple of elf tribal cards like Elvish Archdruid Priest of Titania and Elvish Champion.

3778358,0,t3_33l8k9,. First of your cube is very lacking of low cmc cards. That is fine if it is a conscious decision but it is going to be very hard to play aggro in your cube. Remember that a good aggro decks needs to be saturated at drops and drops while a control deck only needs a single finisher or two. For example White only has  aggro drops Mother of Runes does not count it should be around  at this cube size I would recommend adding two of the following Soldier of the PantheonDragon HunterStudent of WarfareMardu Woereaper. The same argument goes for red and black especially red the traditional aggro color.. Furthermore you really like double colored mana cards at the CMC and CMC slots I know it might seem like the mana is good enough to support it but the math really shows that  colored mana cards are really tough on your mana base unless you play monocolored. In general a C card is much better than a CC card and so the CC card needs to be really really good to be included. In a cube as small as  I would definitly cut all of the following cards Grand Abolisher Leonin RelicWarder Nantuko Shade Vampire Hexmage Ash Zealot Dragon Whisperer Kargan Dragonlord Strangleroot GeistAs well as clearing up the CMC sections a bit. I would for example cut Silverblade Paladin and Kira. . Other than that I do see some odd card choices but I wont go into detail on them as that is what makes a cube unique and is something you can change over time through testing.Tldr The lowersegment of your curve is to thin and you have way to much of double colored mana costs.,mtgcube,cqmykz0,1,t5_2smkx

4214168,0,t1_cs0eu36,Hey thanks a bunch for the fleshed out response.Just some more info I originally was gearing it to be like the holiday cube but I was having to much trouble creating proxies that had a similar feel or print quality to normal cards.Ill pull out the Sol Ring amp Mana Vault if at some point in the future I find decent proxies or can get some collectors edition power Ill put them back in.

4359019,0,t3_3axtqv,For red in my cube it usually goes into a few archetypes.    Aggro splashing black or whiteThis is reds bread and butter its aggressive with plenty of  power  drops some other value creatures on the curve and a little burn to go over the top.  Simple and effective.  RU Spells matter controlRed has a lot of spells that are very valuable.  And blue is glad to pick them up for some direct board control and threats.  Lightning Bolt might just be the most value card ever printed.  Magma Jet might not be reds piece of the pie but few red decks will skimp on playing it and in a more control focussed deck its a value house. Blue also usually lacks ways of dealing with multiple spread threats so cards like Arc Trail and Flames of the Firebrand are great at picking off small threats and stabilizing the board.  Blast From the Past is a fun card its an Unhinged card but its neat.  Often played by cycling it for R and casting it for its madness cost off of the cycling discard lighting bolt with draw value.Creatures like Young Pyromancer Grim Lavamancer and Snapcaster Mage help boost this color pairing and the planeswalker Chandra the Firebrand is another potential value piece.  Splinter Twin ComboAnother Red Blue pairing more focused on getting specific cards. namely KikiJiki Mirror Breaker or Splinter Twin and a card to combo off with Deceiver Exarch Pestermite Restoration Angel or Zealous Conscripts all allow you to go infinite.  For this combo deck looters like Faithless Looting are much more valuable than Tormenting Voice.  Seeing your draw before the discard is crazy valuable and with flashback you get to see even more cards and when youre looking for a specific few mo cards is mo better.  This deck usually combines with the one above but doesnt have to.  WildfireI know you said that your group doesnt like it but just want to include it in my breakdown.  This is my RG pairing usually and it doesnt always have to contain wildfire to work.  Its a solid midrange deck with a few manafacts and other mana accelerants with some great value creatures.  There are some great red  drops that just wreck the board and being able to fireball at the end is even more betterer.  Its easy to splash a few black cards for a more disruptive Jund archetype.Some people run a RG aggro but aggro just isnt what green wants to do in my cube it wants to go big or go home.  If its playing creatures smaller than  theyre for utility for midrange or combo archetypes.Lastly theres a small bit of reds color pie that I think youre missing and thats the artifact breaking.  Creatures like Manic Vandal and Torch Fiend continue reds theme of being disruptive.  Spells like Smash to Smithereens Pillage or Ancient Gridge all show reds hallmark of hating artifacts and being generally disruptive.,mtgcube,csgztf1,2,t5_2smkx
4368784,0,t3_3b1ssp,Is mill really a viable theme? Even in player it is hard to get it to work in cube because mill cards tend to do nothing unless you get critical mass so they only go in exactly one deck and just clog up the draft. In multiplayer this is compounded because milling out more than one person is really really hard. Im not familiar with UB spirits enough to suggest a replacement but pretty much anything has got to be better.For UG one option for a theme would be bounceETB effects given you have used  counters elsewhere.

4563723,0,t3_3dhie5,Ive taken more of an archetype route with my cube. Having such a small cube really causes the choices both towards archetype support and for general power level I make to be a bit more far stretching that if the cube was more normal sized. Regarless cards that you want to be on the lookout for would be ones like Seeker of the Way which fits in with lifegain any type of aggressive deck and whats coloqually known as the spells matter deck which can range from UR to RW to WU typically. The archetypes that Im supporting forcing if you will BW Enchantments Matter Anchored by BloodCursed Knight Ethereal Armor Griffin Guide  and blacks abundance of good enchantments. UW Skies Thunderclap Wyvern Talrands InvocationLingering Souls  Split Decision or the other good flying creatures. UB Um... I dont really have a concrete archetype for this. Mostly looking to counterkill your stuff and try to get stuff reanimatedbounced for value. RB Fast Aggro Between Red and Black there are  one mana creatures  if you count Signal Pest plus Lightning Bolt and a good amount of low cost equipment. Hellhole Flailer is in as a finisher either on the ground or flung hopefully while equipped with ClampGrafted Wargear. RG Tokens This is where I differ from most designers. Red has good tokens producers in Mogg War Marshall specially when blinkedreanimated and Young Pyromancer. And then theres Hordeling Outburst. In green between Imperious PerfectJade Mage and then the near dizzying amount of token producing spells I went with Gruul War Chant as my lynchpin card. GW Ramp Land Tax and Greens ramp spells. This plays more like a midrange aggro than anything. GB Graveyard Stuff Dredge. Looks to get stuff into the GY and then plop down either a Revenant or a Nemesis of Mortals for cheap. Reanimator. Still looks to fill the graveyard but also looks to steal the other players deadies with your reanimate spells. Both decks like Nyx Weaver as an engine but also as a way to get back an important spellcreature or fixing land. UR Spells Matter This is a newer archetype but is Anchored by Delver of Secrets and Monastery SwiftspearYoung Pyromancer. The UR version is more of an aggro deck looking to put pressure on with creatures supplemented by spells whereas the UW is more of a grindy control version with things like Jhessian Thief and previous Seeker. RW ControllyAggro While RB is a burnfast aggro color combo RW is more a go wide with reds tokens and then white anthems Soltari Champ amp Consuls Lieutenant. While holding off any pressure with NyxFleece Ram and Wall of Omens.In addition to archetypes you also can also fit in little two and three card synergies. I find these more fun specially when your drafters find them and use them. Sometimes they work and sometimes they dont. I just added Tainted Strike and Contagion Clasp. The Clasp was added because I have a small  counters matters theme in green with Bramblewood Cytoplast RootKin and Curse of Predation and thought that they could do work together potentially. Also Bramblewood is great because he fits nicely with all the different warriors that are already present in most peasant cubes.Needless to say I wrote far to much and rambled on.

5035109,0,t3_3jwn4c,Signets are the best common mana rocks by far. Color fixing ramp no drawbacks like ETBtapped its the best of the lot. It all depends on the power level size and format of your cube. In most standard cubes people argue against adding the full  signets or even playing cc mana rocks because it really puts aggro decks at a disadvantage when any nonaggro deckcolor gets the benefit of playing colorless manafixing ramp. IMO the full signet cycle should only be included in cubes. Some smaller cubes circumvent this by only including signets for only a few guilds primarily bluebased ones in cubes where blue aggro isnt supported or for nonaggro colors that encourage a specific archetype UWUB for control UR for Wildfire decks. The common options for artifact fixing are primarily the cc colorlessgenerating mana rocks. Worn Powerstone Thran Dynamo Basalt Monolith are always safe additions. Gilded Lotus Coalition Relic are also better expensive options. Mind Stone Coldsteel Heart Everflowing Chalice are also great for smaller cubes if you choose to omit all or most of signets. If you want more powerful options Mana Vault and Grim Monolith are exceptionally strong but the power level of your cube has to be exceptionally high such that aggro decks dont just fold instantly on the back of someone having a cc play on t because of this. All the aforementioned cards are the ones most commonly seen in Legacy based cubes. Also I dont see the purpose of using signets in powered cubes running Moxes unless your cube is ,mtgcube,cusx7bm,4,t5_2smkx

The vast majority of the time the instant speed is going to be far more relevant.  So as a result Dreadbore doesnt make many main decks for us.  I dont think you can run both Terminate and Dreadbore in a Rakdos section.  Like if they printed another Dreadbore there is no way that would be included.I still have Dreadbore in as more of a sideboard buffer against card types but that doesnt mean it is right to run Dreadbore over Terminate.  Its just something I live with.Chainers Edict still has an effect at two mana you dont need to get to  to have any kind of bonus.  The mere presence of the opponent at  lands with a Chainers in the yard can make me rethink whether I want to play something onto an empty board.I guess it comes down to is I do not mind running arguably worse  flexible removal spells at the two mana slot but at the three mana slot I expect more from my cards.

5305922,0,t3_3no19i,Looks like you have done well to get started and honestly with cube it is hard to build something completely unfun. Normally we spend our time bickering over minutiae here in pursuit of some idealised perfectly balanced environment.With that disclaimer I am going attack your ground rules as applying arbitrary rules is a good way to limit your options for improving your environment.First things first consider proxying especially the land base. A solid mana base is one of the best things you can do for your environment.The big issue I see in your ground rules is the fixation with precise numbers. For examplegt  Planeswalkers per color  per guildDont do this. Include Planeswalkers that fit exclude ones that dont. Limit your numbers if they are pushing your environment in too midrangey a direction expand them if midrange needs a boost. Arbitrary numbers appeals to the cube designer because they spend a lot of time looking at the cubetutor page but it doesnt actually do anything positive for the environment. No one is going to draft on the basis that they know there are precisely  red Planeswalkers they might see.Likewise  Lands per colour? This seems incredibly forced. If you are taking a land over a card in Cube that land had better be pretty damn powerful. A dual land is very powerful because it opens up greater flexibility in which cards you can realistically play in your final . Bojuka Bog does not. Of the top of my head I can think of a very short list of singlecolour lands which are probably worth taking over a cube card of average power level Tolarian Academy Gaeas Cradle Shelldock IsleAnd maybe Urborg but that card is basically fixing as are I guess the Vivid Lands. The theme here is that those lands are pretty busted where most other lands dont offer so much over a basic land to warrant giving up another pick.Another numbers oriented issue is the insistence on exactly equal numbers for colours and guilds. Sure it looks good in cube tutor but it is so far down the list of things that are actually important for your environment. If Black has  cards and Red has  then technically a drafter in Red has more playable cards but with variance in distribution across packs and numbers of drafters in colours etc. it is going to take a vast number of drafts for the effect to be felt. Exactly equal guild sections is not such a big deal as often your sections will be something like  cards but when you are insisting on exactly equal distribution and yet are classifying Jarad Golgari Lich Lord and Murderous Redcap the same way there is definitely room for closer examination of your selfimposed guidelines.On the list as a whole you have already called out some of the biggest issues excepting the existence of Sol Ring with the curve and the manabase. Your aggressive decks look very poorly supported and partly that is an issue of curve but also it is an issue that is brought about by your inclusion of cards which shut down aggressive starts. Timely Reinforcements and Hornet Nest do nothing but wreck aggressive decks and your bigger effects like Gideon Jura Baneslayer Angel Grave Titan etc are incredibly effective at undoing any gains an aggressive deck may have made. Your Wrath density is also very high.Of individual card selections I am sure you will refine the selection as time goes on. I found when I was looking at your list I kept seeing cards which caused me to check for the cards I would naturally expect to find alongside them. For instance Invisible Stalker is in your list which I feel pretty negative about. Why would you try to reduce interaction? It does however serve well as an example a card which plays really well with permanent power boosts such as Auras and Equipment. However your list offers Hyena Umbra and Bonesplitter. That is it. If you want to include cards like this you need a certain density of support. Either more effects like these need to be in the list or Invisible Stalker shouldnt be there. Similar thinking applies to cards like Etched Champion with artifacts or Grave Pact and Blood Artist with sacrifice outlets. It feels a little like there are lots of smatterings of ideas but they are not quite solidified into coherent themes.I think a good starting point would be to work out a small subset of cards you like then think about what they need to succeed. You mentioned Sublime Archangel. That card really rewards gowide aggressive strategies so plays well with tokens or in white weenie decks. Lets say we explore tokens what colours do we want to do that in? In white? Or offer the white weenie deck for Sublime Archangel and do tokens in Red or in Green such that those decks have a reason to look to white for a payoff for their gowide cards. Then how could other colours leverage tokens? Tokens are spells rather than creatures so maybe Prowess is interesting? Does black want to sacrifice them to get ahead? From there you can solidify how colours interact and think about possible interactions as you work outwards from there.Best of luck. You have an adventure ahead.,mtgcube,cvpw5p4,2,t5_2smkx
5310077,0,t1_cvq8u9x,I do say that I have to agree here. When you are routinely seeing  or  Planeswalkers per pack and I dont even have all the ones I wanted initially it detracts from then pure power that Planeswalkers are meant to be. You shouldnt always expect to be able to draft  planeswalkers.  would be sufficient enough that everyone should have a chance to get at least one. It puts them more on a pedistal decreasing the number and allows for more balanced games. Thank you for the input. Im glad I hadnt already purchased all of them before I fully realized this discrepancy.,mtgcube,cvqf9ob,1,t5_2smkx

What kind of bonuses does the sheriff get? Do you use any sort of range rules?Something to keep in mind is that in Bang! youre mostly limited to doing mean actions against other players while there are a lot of ways to do nice things for other players in your cube. So players might figure out each others roles a lot sooner compared to Bang! though perhaps a metagame might evolve where outlaws give the sheriff life or cards or whatever to fake being the deputy.,mtgcube,cwb053u,1,t5_2smkx

5728270,0,t1_cx74tt8,Yeah I mean its not the right pick but Id for sure try to make it work.

Throw in some recursive dudes Blood Artist Smothering Abomination... mmm.. The stuff!,mtgcube,cx75bt0,2,t5_2smkx
5757861,0,t1_cx9oon9,gtI appreciate your interest and will try to reply in kind. I also think that your points are valid and that having a power max style of cube can also lead to very fun and interactive games but perhaps for a different playerbase.I feel like power max is sort of a negative term meaning playing cards for power rather than fungameplay.  If so my cube is not power max.  I exclude the power  sol ring and other stuff that either too powerful or just unfun like Mind Twist True Name Nemesis etc.  I also exclude some stuff that are color pie breaks which to me is not fun.gtAlso one particular member in the competitive group has a very strong disdain for the MTGO cube which has skewed his idea of cubes in general citing that he doesnt feel like hes rewarded for drafting any sort of synergy or making any real choices apart from whats the most powerful card here?I dont have a ton of experience with the MTGO cube but my goal is create an environment where its possible to draft synergy and nonsynergy decks.  For my Innistrad set cube I really focused on synergy decks and its hard to draft a nonsynergy deck in that cube.  In my regular cube some cards are individually powerful enough to group together into good stuff decks which is fine to me as long as synergy decks exist and are reasonable competitive.gtHowever how does this compare to threat density a typical RU twin list? Im assuming theyll run things like Wurmcoil Aetherling TNNemesis etc...? Is there enough removal for everything which is objectively more powerful than a lone ExarchMite? I just think it creates very oddly punishing situations where its impossible to tell whether holding removal for Twin is correct or using it to kill a more pressing threat. This sort of thing doesnt happen in modern at least as far as I can see.The thing is in cubes Ive seen with the Twin combo the Twin decks are basically UR Control decks with Twin as the finisher.  They are quite similar to the deck in Modern.  I also dont really understand how your criticism is Twindeck specific isnt not having enough answers bad no matter what the threats are?  If my opponent just has more good stuff than I have answers for Im probably losing and it doesnt matter that its a specific combo.  Im just as dead from a Wurmcoil as I am for a million clerics.  My point was more about how the Twin combo is answerable unlike some other more difficult to answer combos e.g. Storm.gtSingleton is a nice... idea? theme? concept? It feels nice certainly and it helps with the wallet but when I stuck to singleton I felt like certain archtypes were cut off completely arcane birthing pod delver gifts and some were constrained storm spirits burning vengeance spawning lightning rift  astral slidecycling. I think the main advantage to singleton is more variety.  I also think that unless frequency is tied to rarity more commons than uncommons etc. then its really confusing to first time drafters of a cube.  So I think its regressive design.  It rewards people already familiar with the cube who should be doing better sort of a rich get richer problem.  As far as specific archetypes I think one strength of singleton is that it feels so open.  With archetype specific design drafts can get too linear with people finding a lane and sticking in it.  This was a criticism of xLorwyn which had linear tribal archetypes.  In the end this is personal preference I suppose and I think a cube could be designed to avoid this problem of linearity.FWIW I dont feel compelled to include any of the archetypes you mention except Pod.  They are fun but I think better suited to a lower power level environment.  In a high power environment I think synergy decks have to be more focused which is the linearity problem.  I think theres room for more power max cubes and lower power cubes.  I like my more power max one just for nostalgias sake and my lower power one for the chance to draft crazy synergies.gtIn terms of supporting aggro having multiples of Lynx for example means that a landfall deck similar to Naya Aggro in modern using fetch lands to beat with  mana s now becomes a consistent option and thus a cool deck.That sounds interesting but my goal for cube isnt to emulate constructed formats its to create a fun limited environment.gtBut if I gave you another option to anchor RU as an archtype Lets say StormSuspend or Arcane or Burning Vengeance or Artifacts and forget the details would you choose that over Twin? WhyWhy not?This gets to the crux of it I think.  My answer is that I like Twin in a powerful cube more than any of the other options listed here.  Artifacts is interesting too but I think it could be some combination of Grixis colors.  I dislike all the others for various reasons my opinion of course  StormSuspend Cards are too parasitic and dont fit into other decks.  Its also sort of poor unless the entire cube gets used.  It feels bad to get all the enablers but have no finishers Grape Shot Empty Tendrils in the draft.  It gets old too I think these decks tend to want to play out the same way every game.Arcane I think the power level of the arcane cards are even lower than the storm cards and so would be hard to exist with some of the more powerful cards run in a lot of cubes.  I also found it kind of weak in MMA drafts and not too fun.  It just let to these really grindy games.  I dont think its good unless its milling with Dampen Thought which is too narrow of a card to include and you would need multiples.Burning Vengeance is fun and definitely included in my Innistrad cube actually one of the reasons I wanted to make a cube of that set.  In an unthemed nonset cube it could be good but it would depend on whether there were combos or if it was more of way to just generate value.  I also dont like how its harder to disrupt.Which all brings me back to why I like Twin.  The pieces are reasonable includes in a variety of decks.  Pestermite is fine KikiJiki is fine although Twin and Exarch arent great.  The other ancillary pieces like Restoration Angel or Zealous Conscripts are actively good.  So basically I can run two playables two mediocre cards and two actively good cards and get a whole new archetype.  The cost is just so low for a deck that plays so differently.  Its low on narrowness.  Also the combo is disruptable by stuff people already play.  We can disagree on how easy it actually is but fact is the answers exist.  I suppose I could play some number of answers to storm or something like Flusterstorm but I like that the answers to Twin are just the good cards Im already running.gtI really dislike GeddonRavages if youre not facing down OmniTell or TPStorm or something broken that wins consistently on turn . Just seems way too swingy and lockout.Yeah but the deck Geddon is best in White Weenie is far from OP and can usually end the game quickly.  Its not my favorite but I like giving tools to aggro.  Its also iconic to me.gtAgain not saying that you cant have combo decks but I think Twin and other infinite combos Like VaultKey are too swingy. Storm that only has access to Warrens as its storm card feels like its pushing it. Anecdote I was piloting storm against my catloving friend and as I was going through the spells she kinda just tuned out. She was not having fun at all because it really was just onesided spell slinging. Which dampens my love for storm and I just have to accept that its probably not a thing I should push in my cube. Its this sort of experience that I think Twin leads to. Ie Instantwin scoopemup move on etc.Two things VaultKey is different because the cards arent good outside the combo too parasitic not like Twin discussed above and from the opponents perspective storm is about the worst combo.  Twin wins immediately whereas storm isnt instant win at all.  Its sit around and watch to see if the opponent fizzles or screws up.  Storm is also super uninteractive unless you are running a bunch of specific answers and then its only interactive in the do they have it or not sense.  Twin has some of that element too but at least is answerable by more commonly played cards and doesnt take forever to win.gtIm definitely a JohnnySpike too but I dont think that should factor into design. Im not designing for myself Im designing for my friends so they can have fun.My cube is an expression of me to showcase what I think is fun about Magic.  Although I like drafting crazy combos I actually mostly draft aggro decks in official limited formats.  I can have fun playing a variety of things but my cube is an expression of me.gt. And well I think if you want to draft specific decks for yourself then MTGO is the cube for that. I can draft Geddon and Stax my favourite btw and not feel guiltyresponsible for the enjoyment of the other players. It comes down to whether Im a player or a designer tbh. Players are good at power maximisation but a game has always been sold on how fun it is not how badly you can break it.I actually dont think this is true.  The worst thing about the MTGO cube as I see it is that its so unbalanced.  Some strategiescolors are just so much better than others that there are traps strategies that are represented and draftable just not competitive.  So I cant draft a specific deck for myself unless Im fine just losing.  To me one must balancing being able to draft synergy decks with overall power level.  If a synergy exists to draft it should be good enough to compete.,mtgcube,cxatfpj,1,t5_2smkx

5811772,0,t3_3us9s7,I love running gb aggro reanimator.  Basically you drop troll  pack rats prowler gravecrawler and you beat down.  Your opponent then has to kill those and slow you down. This gives you time to combo and reduces their removal. Boar umbra is good here  as you can use it to beat early  or protect your fattie later. Putrid leach also works well here.  Throw in some discard and removal of your own and you are looking great.  Cards like the titans are great as they are good to reanimate early  and can be played on curve. Its very powerful because it has multiple lines of attack  and god draws.  Most of the cards that make this good should already be in your cube  so it wont take much more to support it. ,mtgcube,cxhi79b,1,t5_2smkx

I could see him getting the axe later on but I also agree with spiderdoofus in that I prefer to make more changes as opposed to less when a new set comes out. It makes sure that the cube doesnt get too stagnant that too many pet cards dont develop that cards dont get overlooked etc. Edit As to the specific card...its a good beater on turn  or on turn  and that makes it an interesting  drop for cubes supporting green aggro. ,mtgcube,cyx27rf,3,t5_2smkx

6902570,0,t1_d0vj2bs,Hey thanks for taking the time to draft my cube. It turns out I actually found and followed your cube on CubeTutor much earlier in the process while searching for references.Ive gone back and forth on whether or not to remove some of the chaff. On the one hand it does make for a more straightforward experience where you can draft the archetypes more reliably without having to pick around bad cards.On the other hand the group I want to play this with has little to no experience with MTG so they dont know what a bad card looks like. I know at least one of them loves chalice of life as a wincon for instance so maybe that discoverybrewing process would keep them coming back? Not sure.My only drafting experience with this thus far was a two person glimpse draft which was a ton of fun and created functional but not exceptional decks. I believe that experience would change drastically with  or more in a more conventional draft as you found out so I will take a look at upping the archetype concentration.The sacrifice outlets comment is really useful to hear. Ill add more of those for sure.,mtgcube,d0yq41a,1,t5_2smkx

Thanks for drafting first of all.Currently Im looking at adding three more red two drops in the form of Abbot of Keral Keep Eidolon of the Great Revel and Plated Geopede as I feel that they will flesh out the two slot a little more.

In red I like the goblin bombardment you already have along with Thermopod.  Some folks like Greater Gargadon its not really my cup of tea.  Black has a ton the best for aggro are Vampire Aristocrat Nantuko Husk Fallen Angel and Dimir House Guard.  Thoughtpicker Witch is more of a control card but is pretty cool. Some artifacts that should be in the conversation are Ashnods Altar Phyrexian Altar and Spawning Pit.  You already have a pretty good crop of threaten effects.  If you are going to make this a thing Id give special priority to Nantuko Husk and Tymaret as having enough zombies to  recur Gravecrawler is a legitimate concern in your cube.

You open a pack with Jitte Black Lotus and Putrid Imp going off MTGO Vintage Cube for an example. When are you ever picking the Imp? Thats one less choice you have to make.Now I presume youre saying if the pack has  s in there you might as well pick randomly. I guess that is true for the first few picks but thats draft you dont know where youll be in the first few picks.

8020855,0,t1_d4hi6u3,Thanks for the advice! I think you touched on the main problem Im having which is trying to make a cube where cube staples and cards like Corpsejack Menace are equally viable. In some places Im trying to purposely keep the power level down like including Lightning Strike instead of Lightning Bolt but I guess it is kind of weird that Im doing that while keeping cards like Skullclamp in. In other places cards like Path to Exile and Flickerwisp are just things that Ill try to upgrade to in the future with trade credit but right now I dont think I want to spend the money on them.I recently did a pretty big nerf of RW aggro because it seemed like a very strong and easy deck to get into. I see what you mean with adding more onedrops so Ill take a shot at incorporating them while still maintaining nonaggro red decks.Based on your advice Im going to add pithing needle  onedrops in red and  in white and try to fit in a few more enchantments instead of spells with similar effects. ,mtgcube,d4hmbch,1,t5_2smkx

8157286,0,t3_4qy3in,I like Keldon Marauders and I think ultimately you have to ask how much you are expecting to get out of your twodrop because I feel trying to argue for WarName Aspirant over Marauders is arguing over some pretty thin margins.Marauders offers a lot of potential synergy with other cards in your list in that it cares about effects which allow it to be replayed to get value out of its ETB and LTB effect it naturally goes to the graveyard where a number of cards care about creatures being and at lower power levels interacts positively with cards that care about counters. Something like WarName Aspirant offers none of these things.,mtgcube,d4x7j0o,2,t5_2smkx
8174207,0,t3_4r8bzt,In theory I like it but having never cubed with it myself take my words with a grain of salt.It seems like the reasons that a lot of people have for it not being great in many decks is exactly what makes it good in Stax. Its one of those narrow somewhatservicable cards in a few decks but really shines in resource denial or symmetry abuse. Its like a Sphinx of the Steel Wind or Sulfuric Vortex  the card is narrow. There are only a few decks that really want it and if your play group doesnt frequently draft that deck or no one is in a particular draft it tables frequently. Narrow cards for me are always tricky to include in my list.That said many have pointed out that the WastelandStrip Mine lock is a pull for Crucible which seems super unfun to me. Stax can kind of be like that but the difference in my eyes is the amount of skill it takes to put together the symmetrical effects of Stax and take advantage of them. Ive been trying to tone down LD in my cube so thats just me.Decent card. Not for every cube I dont think and there are definitely a lot more cards that you could pick up before you shell out the  for one.,mtgcube,d4zbqcc,4,t5_2smkx

Board states where you have an equipped exaltbuffed attacker backed by a firststriking wall of blockers have worked out pretty well.Fire Covenant  One of the more suicidal cards of the suicidal guild but the blowouts are real.Magister of Worth   flier that destroys all other creatures on ETB. It doesnt even have a castfromhand clause like its older counterparts and so works with blink and reanimation.Searing Blood  Red needs to clear out blockers to get creatures through. It also needs all the face damage it can get. This one isnt dependent on landfall like Searing Blaze but it can be fizzled.

8407659,0,t1_d5sdnjs,Thanks for the input!I just wanted to take a second to explain my thought process. In a real draft any given set contains a mix of bomb great good filler trap trash sideboard combo and synergy cards.In general I used this philosophy when designing the cube. In my mind some filler cards and sideboard cards are totally fine? Or narrow cards that fit into a limited number of decks. I was trying to emulate a traditional draft after all. Perhaps this is my cube inexperience at play here but I dont necessarily feel that every card has to be an amazing cube worthy pick. Limited environments are like this and most players seem alright with it.I dont know. Maybe I designed it all wrong. Maybe its fundamentally different being a singleton with no rarity filtering. Perhaps more fixing to make it easier to branch into other colors to get more playables?As a side note I dont really know how good the cube tutor AI is so they could possibly be messing up the draft.,mtgcube,d5si3we,2,t5_2smkx
8445869,0,t3_4vclmp,Especially for budget cubes and smaller cubes dont be afraid to strategically break up land cycles.

9124054,0,t3_5582bx,I will review it more indepth later when I have some more time but just some general broadstrokes notes.The signets are really strong. They are usually first picks over more interesting or exciting cards and should be picked up almost regardless of what else is in the pack regardless of color. Perhaps most damning in my opinion is that they take away from Greens role as a ramp color. With access to signets it can be easy to go  color good stuff control. The second note is that aggressive creatures without much upside looking at you Elite Vanguard and friends are pretty terrible in multiplayer. Since you have multiple opponents in multiplayer each card needs to bring more value or power to the table to compete. Doomed Traveler is great since it dissuades attackers and leaves behind a relevant body after it chumps. One other thing I would encourage you to include multiples of creaturesspells and use more of the conspiracies that care about cards with particular names. Odd ball cubes like Conspiracy or Multiplayer cube are a great place to bend the traditional cube rules a bit. ,mtgcube,d88k99z,3,t5_2smkx
9232502,0,t3_56s2kn,If you are looking to fulfill all of these criteria the easiest way to go about it or at least a base point would be to potentially start based off of a specific set that is themed around the shards or guilds. Say if you were to use Return to Ravnica as your starting point and the ten guilds were your focus. Each of the Guildleader legends were more or less designed to be commanders and RtR is known for being a spectacular draft format.Perhaps I dont quite get the constructed element but to me it seems that it would be pretty much impossible to recreate a constructed feeling while still being singleton.Best of luck!,mtgcube,d8macmz,2,t5_2smkx

I felt like it drafted pretty well and am happy with my deck not perfect but good enough. I did  packs of  since I think that feels better for smaller cubes rather than seeing the same packs over and over again. I think white looks OK but honestly Im not a great limited player.

9289935,0,t3_57obju,Jesters Cap to me feels like a card like Shatterstorm or Tormods Crypt a card which is a targeted hate card against certain types of decks. In this case Jesters Cap is a hate card for threatlight control decks or combo decks which rely upon some certain class of card to win stripping all of the fatties from an Oath deck for instance and even in these pretty specific scenarios Jesters Cap is still incredibly slow and as such likely ineffective. It seems like a mediocre sideboard card in very specific constructed metagames.So you are trying to make an already pretty ineffective card work in an environment where the decks it is designed to target dont really exist with any consistentancy for most cube lists. As such Jesters Cap is typically trying to solve a problem that doesnt really exist and trying to solve it in a clunky way. I am not sure why you are trying to make it good and though you could build a cube with some really specific interactions Runic Repetition? Misthollow Griffin?

9430787,0,t3_59meah,The only Kaladesh cards that I think should make the cut in any pauper cube are Renegade Freighter and Peema Outrider. But my cube is very archetype and synergy driven so I have included some others.Glint Sleeve Artisan and Propeller Pioneer fit into the RW gowide theme nicely. As well as the UW artifacts deck. Gearseeker Serpent comes in as a nice finisher for the UW artifact deck. Eager Construct and Sky Skiff come in to support the aforementioned UW list. Accomplished Automaton replaces Hexplate column as another reanimation target. Hijack comes in for the RB sacrifice deck just because there arent as many  cmc threaten effects at common as you would think. Cube ,mtgcube,d9bf0kj,1,t5_2smkx

9500072,0,t1_d9k21yb,Yup Ive seen the same thing in Tribal cubes. You run into three options.. You build a certain tribe no one else does and you build a great powerful deck.. You build a certain tribe someone else does you are forced to make use of two tribes. Ex Kithkin and soldiers. Which can still pull through but you loose more synergy between your cards specific to one tribe.. You build a certain tribe someone else does you both force that tribe and end up with bad decks.I dont think its as bad as infect but there is really no competitive drafting involved besides those three scenarios which leads to a fairly hard cube to design around imo. I like to think loose tribe synergies are more effective than full tribe synergies for this reason. I played a tribal cube in which most tribes only had like  cards between them but with overlapping types like bird soldier and I found that was the most effective way to handle it. Ill try and find a list for it but it offered tribe synergy with that overlapping competitive drafting you need to make a draft fun and interesting to play.,mtgcube,d9k342x,2,t5_2smkx

Maybe looking at what I have will help you decide what you want to include in your cube. I dont have my list of commanders but it looks like you already have that squared away. Another thing i like to do to smooth the draft out is draft  packs of  cards pick  every pack. Makes the draft really fun. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions,mtgcube,da2nk6g,1,t5_2smkx
9700140,0,t3_5e08os,We use the cube in my flair just a normal one and we tend to do Lawyer Drafts more often than not with the occasional Winchester Winston or Sealed game when we feel like trying a lower power level.,mtgcube,da8qza3,1,t5_2smkx
9734611,0,t1_dacv51g,I think it comes across more honestly when you say that you do not like Hornet Queen and high card efficiency like it ie Grave Titan Brimaz or Wurmcoil.  At that point I would probably not have responded at all because I understand where you are coming from and what context is involved.  I love these cards as does my group and one of the primary things I am concerned with is how efficient things are in a limited context.  My cube is hugely aggressive so I want my aggro cards to be efficient as well as my control ramp and midrange cards.  Is is how my format works.  A lot of the cards you mention do function at the same level as Hornet Queen rightly so.  I do not run Emrakul or any overly large titan because they are too inefficient and hard to resolve go into too few decks.  The games do not last that long they are poisonous to have in packs and they are dead weight the majority of the time.  I run Worldbreaker and while fine enough in what he does he is dogshit versus aggro.  Atarka has been fine but sees little play mostly due to being absent from the packs when big green is being drafted.  Prime Time I run but have never liked the card just does nothing overall.  Avenger is fine but never did end up trying out it is just kind of a poor Hornet Queen in practice at this point.  Avenger does the useless dragging out the game where Hornet Queen is the bomb.I do not have a problem with green there is nothing for me to fix.  What I would like is more playable artifacts some more token or broader less aggro options for red decks and to give black some more components to jell some of its unfocused deck types.  And a replacement for Emeria Angel dear god.  Not to mention all the Simic cards are unplayable.I do not want to stonewall aggro I want it to thrive.  I do want answers or payoff cards to be available that are good against both aggro and other decks.  I play  swords and Jitte.  I am also the one in my group who almost always runs a Naturalize effect main deck and usually blows out someone with it.  Swords are not even first picks here they can be when the pack is weak enough.  But they are slow  mana commitments.But yeah.  You dislike Hornet Queen because it is an oppressive board cluttering answer and or threat that is generically good.  That is why I think the card is excellent.  I want more cards like that.

Dragon Shield sleeves are pretty durable but Ive had serious problems with the consistency of how theyre cut.  Buy two packs of Dragon Shields and youll be able to tell which sleeves came from which pack.  So theyre not really good for something the size of a cube. KMC sleeves are durable and consistent.

10467799,0,t1_dcul3a0,I agree with you that trying to support  colored decks would probably not work out too well. However blue does lend itself to cheap evasive creatures. On the topic of  color though one thing that eternal masters did well with its commons and uncommons was there was a decent amount of bleedover in  color pairs. Having cards that fit multiple archetypes is very important to limited construction. If we go back to Tormented Soul it also showed up in M where it enabled you to always trigger bloodthirst in jund colored decks. ,mtgcube,dcumrda,1,t5_2smkx
10471956,0,t3_5pxquw,General question regarding cards like Tasigur as Black vs. GoldFor people who consider it a gold card how do you balance your Golgari vs. Dimir? Lets say you normally run  of each gold combo how do you handle Tasigur? Or is it separately included as a sultai card? For people who classify as a Black card alone do you think it makes GolgariDimir have a slight edge overall with more golds for it? I dont run any traditional three colour cards in my cube but I do have Tasigur Alesha and Soulfire Grandmaster in the cube. Currently I have them in the mono colour sections because IMO all three are playable without their abilities already but maybe this is a mistake. My group is likely too casual to notice the difference anyways but still curious to what peoples thoughts are. ,mtgcube,dcv3r62,7,t5_2smkx

11052310,0,t3_5xrutu,There are a lot of factors. First its kind of slow. Hypothetically getting this down turn  and activating it turn  might be too slow versus a number of decks. There should be an amount of.tines you can get it down earlier though which leads to another point you can be pressured by boards that dont have three creatures. Even decks that actively want to attack you can pressure you with two efficient creatures giving you an enchantment that does nothing.That being said for a.larger cube that goes in on the oath plan I like having defense as a back up. I dont think it makes the cut in smaller cubes but it gives some amount of redundancy in a larger environment. ,mtgcube,dekrdr0,1,t5_2smkx

11295944,0,t3_616w7k,Im a bit confused about what this has to do with accurate hybrid classification. You were running a hybrid section and a multicolour section and then you changed that to a solely multicolour section which you did purely for real estate reasons. The tldr to me seems to be you dont need as many multicolour cards.Now as someone who runs  guild spells at  peasant the after effects seem unrealistic to me. The cube feeling much leaner is something I feel after making any  card change to my cube as you remove  cards that get wheeled to  cards that dont get wheeled. At  the difference of  cards is fairly minor especially when as multicolour cards they tend to be more powerful which means most of the  cards in the draft shouldnt wheel.I do agree that you definitely dont need a large guild section. A lot of guild cards particularly at higher power levels are replaceable by a monocoloured card that is only slightly weaker. However larger guild sections in my experience will tend towards more complex drafting situations because you can take more of the pack have to consider double costs more have to have a very accurate idea of power level vs. fixing and it is more obvious what colour combinations are open.As for your exclusions most of them are fine imo I would not cut  mono coloured cards for those ten cards. Electrolyze is certainly not mediocre and it and fireice are both good fireice gets more tempo while electrolyze gets more value. I would argue for voice over dryad militant as voice is significantly less replaceable but budget is a valid concern. I would personally put Ojutai over your entire azorius section as Ojutai does basically everything an azorius deck ever wants to do.,mtgcube,dfcdn8f,4,t5_2smkx
