9626415,0,t3_569h66,Did you resolve the problem? I just noticed this problem a week ago. None of my new uploads show up in the mobile app. I uninstalled the app updates and cleared the app data and found my entire library is inaccessible. Im now being told in the app that I have to pay  to hear my uploaded music. What a kick in the pants. I have  tracks uploaded too! ,googleplaymusic,d9znjsm,1,t5_2x9c7

10735730,0,t1_ddmrg2t,Also the extremely inconsistent side menus which are different depending on whether its a song or an album. And sometimes I can click on the preview picture of the artist when on an album page to see the artist page but sometimes I cant. And all the incorrect metadata. And they never spell MF DOOM with all caps.,googleplaymusic,ddnb5zv,3,t5_2x9c7
10742473,0,t1_dd0s7ce,Sorry to hear that. I often recommend people set a prepaid debit preferably one that cant be overcharged for the shared family payment method but it can be a hassle to set that up. I appreciate saving money and try to be respectful of the family plan creator shout out to uTheCoralineJones Im thankful to be on your plan  especially with your taste in movies in the family library! and its awful that someone took advantage of you. Good thing for family plan managers to be aware of and safeguard against for sure  or just decide that the risk isnt for you.,googleplaymusic,ddo06mf,3,t5_2x9c7
