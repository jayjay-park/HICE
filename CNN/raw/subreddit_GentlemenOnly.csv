Decent car model could be found at a slightly smaller scale than what you probably used to build Airfix has a couple starter set cars something like  or this  stays below  bucks for interior details engines and stuff the kit comes with the proper paints and a basic bursh and for everything there is a tube of glue. Then like  on a Tamiya spray paint for the body and thats right around  bucks just to see if you still like it.Also if youre interested check out rmodelmakers. Good stuff lot of really friendly guys.,GentlemenOnly,dgpb719,1,t5_3k47w
