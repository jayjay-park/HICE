I agree that people should support the cause it is very important and can ruin lives. But when after nearly every video college humor sticks a cause along with it it make me not want to watch college humor videos anymore because I know I wont leave the video with a good feeling but rather with the bad feeling that is the injustice of the world around me ,collegehumor,cwq0z0f,3,t5_2ss6c
