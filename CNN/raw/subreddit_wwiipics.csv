5093140,0,t1_cuywt7x,I think its a slippery slope when you begin to politicize otherwise specific terms in context.Because otherwise you could argue that in every war some country is being liberated.

There was also a period of mass rape during Soviet military occupation. Same could be said about North Korea liberating South Korea from American oppression.,wwiipics,cuzwxh4,2,t5_2tb0j
