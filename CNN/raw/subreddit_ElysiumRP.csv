Red pink and brown are the new colors of what was once a hectic city which has now become the stage of a terrible battle. The air which would normally be vibrant with the sound of work trade and craftsmanship is now glowing red with fire and thick with smoke ash and embers theres no coming back from this. Two trained armies fight each other because of the lies of their leaders but its becoming clear which side will win. The wounded of the losing side lay in heaps across the city and the faces of the fighters are grim with pain and agony but they force themselves to fight nonetheless. With the thought of victory in their minds the winning side fights as if theyre invinsible. Some have succumbed to a frenzy and are carelessly charging any enemy without a care for their own safety while others fight by only focusing on their enemy and not the carnage around them. The toll on both nature and humanity is heavy. Itll likely take ages before this city will have recovered. Its clear blood lost bombs and bodies have taken the place of roads homes and monuments.,ElysiumRP,d0atant,1,t5_3cbzj
