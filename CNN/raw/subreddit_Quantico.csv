7078715,0,t3_4ce8bm,I know this is going to be controversial but I was wondering if they could change the color palette or even add stylistic lens flare in the past and present periods. If they could artistically add in special effects in specific scenes it would help in differentiating between the two timelines. Some shows like Limitless and Fringe experiment with certain colors lens flare or filters to denote a scene that is distinguishable between time periods or mind states. ,Quantico,d1iqjwc,2,t5_37nxu

7609204,0,t3_4jius7,OKAY I AM SO CONFUSED. Why is Alex not in the FBI anymore? And am I the only one who doesnt want this new CIA thing to be legit? I watch Quantico because its about Quantico. The FBI. Special Agents. The cool stuff. Im not really that interested in the CIA. Joshua Safran said that Season  is going to be like a new novel rather than a sequel to the first season. Like wtf? If youre going to do that then why not just make a new show and call it Langley? I want to see all the old characters I want it to be the same show and I dont want it to completely forget about the first season. This better not disappoint because this is the first show Ive completely invested myself in since Lost ended in ...,Quantico,d374l9w,13,t5_37nxu

7620771,0,t3_4jnlze,Last week I commented that I loved how Alex drove the truck into Times Square while telling The Voice Im not gonna help you kill all these people. Ummm actually Alex thats exactly what youre doing. If you didnt want to kill all these people you shouldve driven the nuke into the harbor not the most crowded spot in Manhattan.Then Simon does exactly that in the following episode! Makes me wonder if the original script had Alex driving the bomb off the bridge to save the day but they had to put another character in the drivers seat after getting renewed for a second season. I cant think of any other reason for two backtoback nukeinthecar scenes where Simon dies heroically in one and Alex drives the thing into the heart of NYC. The contrast makes her look like a terrible agent. ,Quantico,d38fx38,4,t5_37nxu
