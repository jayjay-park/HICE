9054814,0,t3_547fl0,I have many questions. How do you clean these?  I assume theyre not safe to put in a washing machine. Why does the purple dragon in the bottom left have a towel over its tail? How did you find the time and space to take this picture? Does your affinity for inflatables cross over into an inflation fetish like a creature becoming inflated like a balloon or are they considered to be different things?Nice collection! ,CoolCollections,d808sn5,5,t5_39kfx
