You just need one device that connects to the mobile web and acts as a router for all of your other devices.

Its sad they didnt continue with the same product and switched over to a garbage build of an android box.Ive recently picked up an MK Android TV box. It uses any of the air mice available from the sites you can buy the box from. These media players are so close to running XBMC smoothly but there is still some lag. Players like MX Player will run any file you feed into it as well you have a huge choice of what to use by just downloading off the play store.

1197449,0,t1_ci49b8i,The autotune with the power company allows power companies to alert Nest of expected high usage time slots due to weather or other events. So the power company tells Nest today between  our grid is going to be overloaded because everyone getting home is going to blast their AC. So lets say you want your home at  degrees. What Nest does is tell your tstat to cool your home to whatever temp the software calculates so at  when everyone elses AC unit is turning on yours is turning off. It then uses bursts of AC throughout the time period to maintain temp but it may allow it to get up to  degrees by . If you let the Nest do its thing during that time slot the power company will give you a credit on your bill for not wanting to use power when everyone else does. You can override the system and say fuck you Nest I want to use all the power I can and it will let you you just wont receive the credit on your bill.The other neat thing that I like is the Seasonal Savings program that has nothing to do with your power company. Basically the way that that works is Nest figures most people are sensitive to temps in their home when going to bed and getting up in the morning. Nest also knows that when seasons change and you switch from heating to cooling you are more sensitive to temps as well. You heated your home to  in the winter and a comparable feels like temp for cooling is . So at the beginning of springsummer the Nest will cool your home to  so you are comfortable as you acclimatize to the warm temps outside. The second week of summer it will keep your morning and bed temps at  but creep your daytime and evening temps up by . degrees. Week  it will creep your morning and night temps up . degrees and your daytime and evening temps up by another . degrees. It will keep doing this for another week or two until your normal daytime and evening temps are  and your wake up and bedtime temps are . You are now saving energy but slowly got used to the higher temps. Of course this is something you can also choose not to use.gtAnd yeah Im a bit extreme on my no ui stance but I do feel strongly about it. Why should we have something on a wall anyway other a nearly invisible sensor? Why have anything other than an app  website? If nest was forward thinking I think that would be the right product. But how do you sell something that you cant see in a store display?Actually I agree with you on your last point. I would love a tiny unassuming sensor box that could just be painted over and controlled via an app or the web. I agree that would be perfect. Add in the ability to place a few boxes throughout your home and could talk to the master unit to help regulate temps in certain places in the home at certain hours and I would buy it day . Our bedroom is always  degrees warmer than where our tstat is and Id love for it to know to keep cooling until that room is  at  every night instead of having to tweak the schedule manually. But until that day comes Ill take the Nest over an ugly beige box any day of the week.,gadgets,ci4bxwn,2,t5_2qgzt

Camera is low resolution compared to most smartphones but it will create photographs which are mostly recognizable and even has a basic panorama mode. There is no flash for the camera and therefore the typical Nokia flashlight isnt available. Was a little disappointed about that.Voice quality is great. And its completely replaced my smartphone as a music player thanks to the bluetooth ADP  gb card and decent battery life.

1556916,0,t1_cjbdup4,gt  What if you want a different home screen? You can separate your home screen in to different categories. Scrolling down through a single home screen is no different than scrolling over through several maybe a bit smoother. gt This is the opposite for almost every windows phone user I know. Go to rwindowsphone and youll see a very different picture.gt Please suggest an alternative to Current Caller ID or Themer two programs Ive been unable to find alternatives to on Windows. Hell show me any alternate launcher to the tiles. Its just like iOS so locked down its almost not a smartphone but a feature phone instead. Also the core apps Facebook TwitterNote that I did say ALMOST always. It is a newer app market and just now starting to blossom as more people are getting interested in them. You can download apps that give you an android skin But windows really didnt want different tile launchers for its phone because they want the customer to have an entirely unique windows experience. Ive never had problems with the core apps so I dont know what youre talking about. They arent the best but its not like they arent constantly improving. Android didnt get a decent facebook app until about  years ago so these things take time to perfect.gt Then why do I find illegitimate apps like this.This app is not published by its creator on Windows and if it were it would be free. This is someone else selling a popular program clone under a name they dont own.This kind of fraud is common place on windows marketplace.That kind of fraud is common in every phone market place. Windows is not liable for copyright infringement in the market place that belongs to the company involved. If there is copyright infringement its mostly due to the company failing to meet demand. And that has nothing to do with quality assurance. Apps have to adhere too windows guidelines to be put in to the windows marketplace. Those guidelines ensures that it works optimally with the phone. Unlike android where you have to go through  different buggy apps just to find one that works. Windows app may be fewer but the ones that are there work even if they dont quite have all of the features yet. There is also a problem of Google blocking any product they have the rights to from being published on the windows phone. The fact that they dont do that to iOs should show you which one they find to be the real threat to their business.,gadgets,cjbfle2,0,t5_2qgzt

1990734,0,t3_2go6be,After giving a lot of thought about waiting for . or taking advantage of the time window for downgrading to .. I upgraded my iPhone S to .. this morning. I was already using it with Reduce Motion Increase Contrast Reduce Whitepoint and Darker Colors All in Accesibility Options in .. since I wanted to get the most of my phone and the animations did not matter that much to me. After the update the device behaviour was a bit random some moments it seemed faster than iOS  and some other moments slower. Following peoples advice about waiting for index to finish I gave it a couple of hour until the device cooled down. Obviously it gets hot every OS update and we all know devices work slower when they are hotter. I did not want to judge the battery while its hot and indexing so I kept it plugged for a while. After that I just left home to run a couple of errands with my phone and when I came back after couple of hours it was still at  percent. And most importantly as the day goes by I cannot even compare if it is faster or slower from .. it just feels same to me. Now that I really focus on lags since everybody is talking about them I sometimes feel a lag but I do not even know if it was there in .. or not. I am OK with this update. Hopefully something like . and . will happen in the couple of months and maybe the device will become even smoother but I do not know if it willl make all of a difference at the end. It just seems fine to me. In my opinion do not buy in to hype of not upgrading and buying a new phone.  There was just one article and everybody refers to the same article. Which says that iPhone S wont be benefitting from Touch ID etc. We already knew that there was no Touch ID it wasnt like that it was suddenly going to get Touch ID that would be like one of those chan trolls. I understand that everybody uses their phone in a different way and some people might be really frustrated with ios. I do not do any heavy gaming or anything so I cant tell you that. I heavily use Spotify Whatsapp and Instagram. It works fine.  ,gadgets,ckt30ms,1,t5_2qgzt

I have heard great things about the android runtime I hope maybe then we would not be needing that much ram in an android phone.

2064107,0,t3_2igfc2,I had to investigate Windows Phone . for work so I forced myself to use a device for three months as my main phone to give it a reasonable chance to prove itself.My issues were primarily note this isnt terribly scientific Backgrounding and restoring apps can be really flaky.  Sometimes they seem to reinitalize rather than picking up from the page you were on.  This is a major pain in the ass if youre in the middle of doing something.  It may be the general shittiness of the apps on WinPhone rather than the OS but it happened often enough to make it annoying. Lack of Windows integration.  Eh?  But it works fine with Windows I hear you say.   Well yeah sure you can drag files onto the device and little else.  Microsoft own the largest most popular desktop OS on the planet.  They could have had some kick ass features that take advantage of that but I found very little.  In fact Id argue that iOS and Mac OS X share more integrated features than Windows and WinPhone. Sometimes there are too many damn swipes to get to obvious places Internet sharing tethering frequently had to be restarted if the phone went to sleep. Horrible apps  both quantity and quality.  Its especially annoying when you find a decent mainstream app that you use often e.g. Spotify and discover that their WinPhone version is a pale imitation of their apps on other OSes and they put the minimum possible amount of effort into it. Sometimes I would try to reduce the volume using the side buttons and the volume value on the display would change but the volume would remain the same even when it went down to zero.  This is unforgivable and only restarting the phone would fix it.On the plus side loved the live tiles and the simple customization of the home screen.

2500180,0,t1_cmk3cva,I have an older version of this if this is what I think it is. It has two tubes to shoot two fireballs that are fleshtoned a battery holder button for firing and clips to hold it to your fingers.You need two AA batteries as well as flash cotton as propellant and flash paper which makes the fireball.You load a bit of flash cotton into each tube ball up a piece of flash paper and stuff it down there too. You push the button and one of the tubes fires a fireball.Its kind of hitormiss as sometimes the paper wont ignite properly and sometimes it flashes too early. But when it works well and when you can manage to not let people realize youre palming this device it is kind of neat. Out of nowhere you throw a ball of flame that just vanishes. I did it once in a dimly lit room at a party and received some nice oohs and aahs.The problem then is right after you do it everyones looking at your hand to figure out how you did that. So you need to pull some misdirection to be able to pocket it before they investigate further.I played with it for a while and grew bored of it rather quickly.

2548488,0,t3_2omjzm,Ok so here is my problem. hope people here can help me or suggest me a solution asap.I live in India. I was on a trip to United States and i bought Moto X first gen from Atnt store near dallas TX. As i was not a US citizen i could only get Go phone service rather then their regular ones. So i paid full price for phone and used it with Atnt network there for a month. a month later i was back to India and will be here for next year or so. i contacted Motorola customer service to unlock my phone as i had paid full price on which i got a reply that i should contact Atnt and not them they cannot help. so i contacted Atnt. they said to wait  months for applying for unlock. so after six months  i bought the phone in march  i try to request unlock through there site and it says not in their database. so i contact customer service to which they tell me as my phone number was not active for  months now so it has been deactivated and passed on to different customer. so phone number linked to my device is no more which is why it does not show in database and will not till i go there and buy new number to link my device to and request again. which is highly unlikely as i have a work here which i cannot leave and even if i just decide to make a trip for my phone it will cost me  times the phones cost full price i mean nor i have someone there in States to send my phone to so they can go through the process not to forget sending phone there and other transport cost etc etc. so no official way Atnt left me hanging. next step as usually people do i go to unlock site. i used site called unlockunit.com to which i paid around  USD and waited for  weeks. they provided me with pins  from atnt in  days and  from motorola in  days. none worked. they said they will refund me and has been  months now still nothing. they say issue in their financial department. that i will have to be patient. so you see i lost faith in this type of sites too. not willing to try others unless i know i will get my phone unlock or my money back.so what i want to know is is there any way i can get my phone unlock. if so how?! can i root my device and get it unlock?! any other method. please do let me know. cause i do not want my  USD go to waste seeing it as just a phone which i cannot use as phone but just to play games on.and sorry if i am a noob for asking this and if this is a wrong place as well. i am a noob.please do help if you can. thank you.,gadgets,cmr839z,2,t5_2qgzt

2647401,0,t1_cn4554t,While I am personally very excited for project ARA I still dont think it will be hugely popular. look at nexus phones  when Google announced them everyone and their cat thought that all other manufacturers will go bankrupt in few months  after all why would you buy a  phone if you can get a a better or equal spec for half the price? And yet they were not such a huge success because the base price didnt make any difference to the contract  you could get a brand new iPhone for  a month or a new nexus  for  a month. So the regular consumer didnt even know that the nexus was any cheaper  to them it was just one among many other phones. I see its the same with the ARA phone  if its offered on contract they can make as big deal as they want out of the fact that its upgreadable  most consumers wont care or at least I dont think they will. Hopefully Im wrong but looking at car or laptop sales upgradeability is the last thing consumers look at. ,gadgets,cn45az1,1,t5_2qgzt

2888057,0,t1_cnwc1l8,OK Ill just let you know though you are likely going to have problems with your DampD PDFs. You can of course put them onto the device but take a look at the dimensions of your PDF pages. They are probably pretty large larger than standard paper. The Kindle screen and most ereader screens are  diagonal. Standard notebook paper is almost  diagonal. The PDFs you view will be scaled. Imagine shrinking your book to one fifth its size and whether you would still find that functional. I do not like putting PDFs on my Kindle. If I have an all word or mostly word PDF I will OCR it with Adobe and convert that to an ebook. You can improve the situation if you crop out margins but it will probably be frustrating for you. Here is an older write up of the issue I imagine these issues are common to all ereaders but some might be better for PDFs. I just use a tablet for full size PDFs better image quality than an ereader anyway.The manga should work fine I think? Those books are smaller. I think someone in this thread commented that they use theirs mostly for manga.,gadgets,cnwdiob,1,t5_2qgzt

2991237,0,t3_2uejvw,I have used the OZC Vertex  GB ADATA SX  GB and WD Black GB SSD TB HDD.The OZC Ive had for about  or  years and has worked well but was just too small in the end for my main PC so I bought the ADATA last year to replace it. I then moved my OCZ to my laptop. My PC was less than a minute to boot but I have a lot of things enabled and started at Windoze login so it takes longer than I really would like. My Laptop would cold boot in about  seconds. It was actually quicker to cold boot than it was to resume.As of last week I have replaced the ADATA drive with the WD Black and will be moving the ADATA to my laptop since Im running out of space on it now. The OCZ will be moved to my HTPC most likely or POSSIBLY my other laptop and use it for only minimal applications I havent decided yet.Out of all three so far I prefer the OCZ it just always seemed to be fast  just too small. I bought it back when SSDs were about GB average otherwise I would have bought a larger drive back then.I like the WD Black for the convenience of having an SSD and HDD in one small form factor. It does take a bit to setup though because of this with some WD specific software. I may eventually get another one for my Laptop.I have not used the Samsung SSDs but they do seem like good drives. ,gadgets,co81feg,1,t5_2qgzt

3100115,0,t1_coj9phu,TLDR  I ramble a lot about TVs and innovation. Only relevant part is that maybe internet connectivity is the next step for TVs and not an unnecessaryunwanted feature.Thats a really good point about hardware switches to control functions on a computer.As for what TVs need and dont need that logic doesnt really make sense to me. I mean there was a time when people didnt need TVs. There was a time when people didnt need color TVs. TVs have gone through a large number of changes since they came out but none of the changes were ever needed to the people of the time. They were just seen as logical progressions. I think TVs are more susceptible to the internetify all the the things trend because of the amount of entertainment the internet provides to many people. Youve got services like Youtube Netflix Hulu Twitch.tv and so on with the express intent of playing videos a task traditionally done on TVs. Is it not the next logical progression to bring those items to the TV? Sure it isnt necessary for a TV but it is a nice feature. A lot of people in this thread are talking about their Rokus and Chromecasts and those are great devices. I love the functionality that my Chromecast brings to my TV because it allows me to view things I follow via the internet. It makes for an overall better viewing experience when I can lay on the couch instead of sitting at my computer desk.All of this goes to say that I think a lot of people ARE expecting this type of functionality from their TVs. TV makers are seeing this and they have been trying to implement connectivity in their devices for years though I will say that rd party devices tend to provide drastically better performance than the bakedin apps.I feel like Im getting a little longwinded here my point is that I think integrating internet connectivity IS the next step for TVs and not just a new gimmick. But all instances of this Ive seen so far have been terrible and need massive usability enhancements.Like I said at the beginning I really like your point about hardware  methods to disable internet connectivity. But when I read through your actions they all seem like things you could do for a TV too. Pull the plug never connect to WiFi sure. Youll never encounter a problem with your TV doing something it isnt supposed to. Youll just limit what it is able to do and for some people that may work.But connecting isnt what you were talking about in your first post. You were talking about not truly ever knowing whats going on inside a computer. You sort of touched on this at the end of your first paragraph when you were referencing things like antiviruses. But how do we know the antivirus is doing anything? How do you know when you install a program that youre not getting a bunch of pieces of spyware? You can uncheck all the boxes but depending on your software source you still may end up with bad programs. Were all pretty much at the mercy of the developers for any closedsource software we install. Sure you can use network monitoring tools to see what is being sent out but what if the software sending out that information is actually your OS. Microsoft uses a tremendous amount of information collected from you and while you can see what it is are you really certain you can stop it? Sure you can go throw Ubuntu on your machine. Now youve lost access to your games and crucial pieces of software. And Im saying this as a Linux opensource fanboy.Were all pretty much at the mercy of the developers. It doesnt matter whether it is a computer a TV a cell phone or a music player. We dont have any way to know if clicking a button on a menu actually does anything and even if we did the solutions may end up just hurting our productivity.Im not saying all of this as a Samsung Sympathizer but Im not also jumping on the THEYRE SPYING ON US train. To people that know how voice technology works they know that Samsung must do this to even make it remotely usable. Do you remember when flip phones had voice commands and how when you called mom it would call uncle Steve? Thats what happens without centralized systems to process the voice data. Google Apple and Microsoft do it to.This story is taking away from a bigger issue at hand. I dont know if youve seen the other recent news about Samsung TVs inserting advertising into DVRd content but I think the real story is there.I think weve reached a point now where companies no longer care about making products or services. Now the only consideration is creating and targeting advertisements and the new innovations being created are being made for those purposes. This will end up stifling true innovation and only making the current products and services more prevalent instead of allowing new things to come out on the market. Well this has become a ramblerant so Im just going to end it here. I dont really expect you to read this because it doesnt really add anything to the conversation but go ahead if you feel like it.,gadgets,cojbqb3,1,t5_2qgzt

Musk could hold out no matter the offer. His friends might eventually be peeled off but only if Apple offered a truly stunning amount.    billion would probably do it and for Apple it would still probably be worth it.Apple is a solid decade behind Tesla and wont be able bootstrap themselves quickly enough to compete this decade.  The only way Apple can quickly gain that decades worth of experience in designing and manufacturing electric cars would be to buy Tesla.The problem is that Elons not selling.  The other problem is that Tim Cook is too cheap to pay the kings ransom needed to force a hostile takeover.,gadgets,coox000,1,t5_2qgzt

3158881,0,t1_cop5zxu,gtI look at war a little bit differently. To me war is a lot of prickwaving! OK? Simple thing. Thats all it is. War is a whole lot of men standing out on a field waving their pricks at one another. Men are insecure about the size of their dicks and so they have to kill one another over the idea. Thats what all that asshole jock bullshit is all about. Thats what all that adolescent macho male posturing and strutting in bars and locker rooms is all about. Its called dick fear! Men are terrified that their pricks are inadequate and so they have to compete with one another to feel better about themselves and since war is the ultimate competition basically men are killing each other in order to improve their selfesteem! You dont have to be a historian or a political scientist to see the biggerdick foreign policy theory at work. It sounds like this What they have bigger dicks? Bomb them! And of course the bombs and the rockets and the bullets are all shaped like dicks. Its a subconscious need to project the penis into other peoples affairs. Its called fucking with people!

Sandbag your battery tech so each incremental increase you dangle in front of the consumer will be just enough to keep the market active.  If you release all day or multi day battery now the processing capabilities and services wont have changed enough for people to go out and buy your shit.It shouldnt be surprising that this is the situation.

You prove your rights to a file by sending an MD hash up to it or the TOC from a physical DVD or BR. If they have it in their loud it gets added to your library.  If not you upload it.  Boom.  Done.  Forever.  Photos? Millions of loud storage services already.Everything is getting streamed.  Nobody even carries MP players anymore or keeps libraries of MPs on their computer.  Everyone is doing PandoraSpotifywhatever the next big thing is.  Even Audiobooks are streaming.Home movies?  Important documents?  Private Youtube Channel. Google Drive. Dropbox.  The key in all this is actually getting the infrastructure in place so we dont have to get our own shit at Mbs.  Get fast data pipes and even your game library will be streaming.  The OnLive idea was ahead of its time.  Steam Streaming works flawlessly  on a highspeed LAN.  Get fat pipes to the houses with minimal latency and you wont need to have a drive dedicated to your steam library.  Itll be coming for you from the loud.Sure itd be nice to hold your own data.  But that could easily be in offline bulk storage.  Like tape.  But more stcenturyesque.  Doesnt need to be fast.  Give me a Jazz Drive with TB.  Remember when Jazz drives came out?  The storage density and costmb was insanely low compared to hard drives of the same time.  Get me that.  And fat pipes.  And good online storagestreaming.Then with all the RampD and purchase power going in to enterprise storage that shit will really start to come nice.,gadgets,cpssi16,1,t5_2qgzt

3621495,0,t1_cq4xikd,I mean I agree the tech isnt there yet but I think youre bashing the idea a little too hard. it doesnt have to be lasers to be a directional beam of energy losses are the most significant problem but some amount is probably acceptable for a beam meant to charge your cellphone.  you cant be arguing in one sentence that the losses are significant and then say but if we assume  losses all these other problems show up. We all know there are going to be losses and thatd ok.Overall the biggest problem this tech faces is that tracking cellphone accurately enough and charging it is going to be pretty hard to develop and the price tag will be expensive. But I dont believe there are any fundamental physics limits.,gadgets,cq52sjr,-1,t5_2qgzt

It was not great for gaming it threw off a ton of heat and I could have bought an  PC that would have had more game titles available. Macs are just soo expensive... that is my hang up.

3636461,0,t3_31zzis,iPhones are just beautifully designed to do it all.  The physical item is durable comfortable and damn sexy.  Same with the software.  It does all the things I need with a simple playful unified interface.  Theres basically no menus it can take a sec to learn the swipes and button conventions but when you do it feels natural to use. Lets use the flashlight as an example.  Whip it out of my pocket click the big friendly button flip up from the bottom click the onscreen flashlight button which is always in the same place click the power button to turn the screen off.  When you write it all out it seems like a lot of steps but its really a second process you can perform with only a brief glance at the screen.  Everything is like that.  I never have to fiddle with settings to get things working.  Every little aspect is goodtogreat quality standard the camera battery screen speakers charger browser flashlight disabled features language support younameit.  It all works.I know iPhones appear to be expensive for the specs you get but my iPhones  and  always seems quick responsive and interactive.  Little things like the rubberband bounce when you scroll to the end of a list now used by everyone give you the illusion youre working with a tool not giving commands to a computer but a fractionofasecond delay ruins the illusion and iPhones dont lag.Except iTunes.  If you buy all your music through iTunes autodownloading works great.  If you have music from other sources it may be a severalhour job to get the things you want transferred to the phone.  Updating it like take out all the Daft Punk and put on all the Paul Simon is possible but pretty hard and still gonna take you a halfhour or so.  Its entirely possible to play your music regardless of source its just the most arcane convoluted process you can imagine and iTunes lags like its simultaneously hosting a team Counterstrike tournament.  This is remarkable because everything else with the iPhone is so seamless.Like any mechanical device they can break down but they never have for me.  My iPhone   or  years old? still works beautifully.  I keep it in my pocket never used a case dropped it several times and a week ago I noticed a single  scratch on the screen visible only in bright sunlight. I do use the Apple leather case for my  because the  is a little slippery without it and it fits SO nicely and looks so good.I recommend iPhone for nontechies who want a complete highquality smartphone.Edit moved a paragraph. ,gadgets,cq6s8er,1,t5_2qgzt

Can either be a simple phone with internet or a complex machine that can do so many things its unreal. And it just depends on how in depth you want to get. If you arent a big tech geek.

However it wasnt until apple pay came out that Google wallet got all kinds of new upgrades and is now insure by the FDIC or will be if Im not mistaken. YES I do realize that Android wear hit the market first. But again not alot of hype and still alot of issues to be handled. I also COMPLETELY agree that apple hasnt done anything advancing with the iPhones yet they have alot of consumers see them as doing a lot of good things. I Lastly also understand marketing but its not just about marketing. Google makes these major advances but seems to sort of half ass it and not really commit to it. Good example is Google wallet. They used NFC and had pay options quite some time ago but it wasnt fully developed. Since the announcement of apple pay there have been numerous advancements to that service that probably should have been done long ago yet they wait till apple does their thing before taking the necessary steps.All Im saying is that I think Google should commit better to their innovations. Yes they may seem strange to the consumer at first but the more you put into it and the more mainstream it becomes the more receptive society is to those changes. Im a lifelong android user and have always loved the things they provide just wish they would step it up and commit to their innovations. ,gadgets,cqixl68,1,t5_2qgzt

4029206,0,t1_crfa90f,I have a similar job except thanks to the recession combined with the more recessionproof nature of our business the majority are too old experienced andor educated to justify the treatment we receive. Nothing brightens the day like an email from management because you spent too much time peeing yesterday! Pretty much every time Ive been asked why Im still in after call I wasnt even aware I was so those reminders are totally appropriate. We have no way to unhit that button during the call so sometimes we hit it thinking its a short call with a few steps to complete afterwards then the caller rambles on and on so long we finish all those steps and forget all about it.The worst thing is when companies collect data but have no idea how to use it appropriately. Our company decided to focus on call length of inbound calls even though every call is vastly variant in length of time required to finish as quickly as possible wo interrupting the caller. To complicate further we have different clientsqueues and some of them are geographically or socioeconomically limited but they dont do any statistical analysis or pay attention to confounding variables. So one employee gets a promotion because they talk to a lot of fasttalking New Yorkers another one gets warnings because they talk to a lot of laconic friendly but financially illiterate hillbillies. The funny thing is most promotions here are just transferring out of the call center with an insignificant raise. So every time a lonely old lady has a simple question answered correctly and efficiently but then starts a monologue about all her health problems and mistrust of banks and every issue that was resolved months ago and has nothing to do with todays call that employee is ultimately judged as an inferior worker overall even if they just want to collate files alone in a phoneless room.I cope by sounding just barely intelligent enough to hold down this job to avoid the Youre so smart you explained that so much better than the last one now you can explain these  other timeconsuming things to me that I wasnt going to bother you guys about!

4033737,0,t3_36mpd3,I worked as a supervisor for one of the Big  NA auto manufacturers. We track a lot of different things for different reasonsEach employee has a RFID badge that gets them through the turnstiles  tracks inout of the plant  are you late? you came in one minute to the bell while technically you are in the building on time we know it takes  minutes for you to walk to your station another  to get your safety shoes on. youre late. You stayed late  hours? This will also help me pay your overtime.This badge also tracks which entrance the employee used. Did they come in from the other side of the plant? through the office?Same system tracks call ins. Employee calls in sick or late. Is there a pattern in their absenteeism? It also helps you know if you need extra people to run your line or not. Your Required To Run  is usually upped by  to account for absenteeism but if the numbers fall short you need to borrow people from other lines. Youre overroll? Send someone to another line or home for the day. Each employee has a computer at their station. This tracks by VIN which car is in station at which time and which operator via employee  is working there. The operator can identify defects as they happennotice them. This helps track defects or retroactively the source of missed defects. This is important information when it comes to government mandated safety issues and recalls. Jonny is responsible for securing seat belts his gun reported a torque failure. How did this happen? This gives the supervisor something to investigate. Could be a bad tool setting could be a missed operation could be defective parts. Knowing who is on the job helps to get answers. Sally keeps inputting the same defect over and over. Is she doing something wrong? Is she following process? Is this a real but acceptable defect? Is she just being a dick? All important questions.The lines move on a chain conveyor system. You can see in real time when and where a stop occurs. Get the same stop from the same station repeatedly? This gives the supervisor something to investigate. Could be an operator not following process SWI could be a bad tool that is holding up the job cycle could be that the job is over cycle and cannot be performed in the time given according to the SWI happens during productivity initiatives could be a new operator being trained and hasnt learned the process fully yet also happens during productivity initiatives. Ultimately the tracking is all about increasing efficiencies. Once an employee is in the building they can move pretty freely without being noticed unless they have a supervisor who is paying attention.

4093072,0,t1_crml0eg,Heres another article about it    gt While that may suggest extremely cheap SSDs I suspect what it actually means is pricing that mirrors the common hard drives of today. So for example you may see the GB Zs for a price roughly around that of a TB hard drive . I could be wrong but the wording by SanDisk supports such a reading. If you consider a GB hard drive today costs around  I really cant see SanDisk offering a GB SSD for  just yet can you?Still hard to believe. Amazing if true. Am hyped.

4112545,0,t1_croz7jk,Very good.  I despise preloaded software anyway but to find out that this Chinese company is installing rootkits on U.S. destined computers is disgusting.  Not shocking makes sense that it would happen but definitely disgusting.  They just demonstrated one reason why the DoD whole USG? has a rule about computer equipment being U.S. sourced.  We had to import U.S. model toner cartridges into Europe because the printers are programmed to accept cartridges from their region.  I guess HP is protecting high margin markets by preventing low margin market cartridges from being used in the high margin areas.  DoD datacenters are bastions of HP or Dell or both.BTW you can get a lot of the functionality theyre talking about yourself by using folder redirection I know it works in XP Vista  and .  Using Documents folder as an exampleTo do it manually in the GUI.  Use a folder that is syncd on OneDrive or DropBox.  Call it something like profile.  .  Inside the synced folder place a folder for each folder that you will redirect.  Windows  has a bunch that work well with this documents desktop favorites music videos pictures contacts etc.  These are the folders you see when you open Computer on Windows  or click the open your personal folder link in Windows  start menu.  .  For each one rightclick the local folder in the explorer window go to the location tab browse select the folder within the synced folder and hit apply.  Hit yes to move your files into that folder.  Note  probably not a good idea to keep large files like .isos or the like in this profile as this will eat up your dropbox space..  On the next device if it is a computer with the storage to hold your profile set it up by using OneDrive or DropBox to pull down the syncd folder then repeat step  to combine the current profile with the synced one..  Clean up any duplicates but be aware that a shortcut to the same app on two computers will only work correctly if theyre installed in the same location.  I.e. theyre not really dupicates.  If one is in Cprogram files and another computer has the same version of the application in Dprogram files x you will need two icons.  Shortcuts may also cause problems if your two computers are different OSes..  For mobile devices you can still search the OneDrive or DropBox but unless you keep a tiny profile duplicating this may not work and Im not sure how to make that happen except with Windows Tablets assuming they use the same type file system.For bonus points you can set up the folder redirection in the registry but it will not move the files or create the folders.Source We used folder redirection at work.  I liked it so I figured out how to do it at home.  Bonuses for using this in home environment are that it is easy to make backups and my daughter thinks Im a wizard because though I wiped out her profile on my computer gasp shock Daddy why did you do that? I was able to combine her profile on my sons computer with what was already on the server and viola now she has twice as many pictures of MLP and wolves and Warrior Cats to plaster on the desktop and screensaver.And when I finally build out her computer Itll be cake and pie to bring her profile to her.,gadgets,crp20fd,6,t5_2qgzt

4216723,0,t1_cs0ua0v,I think people here confuse the sync pulse of the monitors refresh rate with video frame rates  an entirely different matter. A monitor might scan  times a second while taking output from a video card at FPS. But if it scans  times a second while trying to display a non divisible frame rate  say FPS then there will be noticeable visual artifacts on display. Tearing in portions of the image.A sync refresh rate isnt applicable to LCD monitors yet remains standard due to supporting old CRT technology. In that an electron gun emits an energized beam at phosphor coated glass. This causes the phosphor to glow. Electromagnets bend the beam. And a circuit is used to bend the beam across the screen in a repeatable scanline pattern from left to right and from top to bottom for a full image frame ignoring interlacing.LCDs only accept scanlines because thats how the standard developed going back to original broadcast television. But its no longer necessary. An LCD interface could simply accept a stream of location deltas to an image frame and do away with formal frame rates altogether. Thats how mpeg works. Video cards and digital displays ought to as well.   ,gadgets,cs0w1sb,2,t5_2qgzt

4331815,0,t3_3alsth,Ive been skepticalatbest of Beats since they first released. However at the same time I didnt necessarily trust the socalled audiophiles who dismissed them immediately without a second thought and without ever actually listening to them.I know  people that have owned Beats headphones. Of those  actually paid for them with their own money the other two got them as gifts. All  are disappointed with them. I actually tried out a pair from one of my friends and can safely say what you hear about them is true  they are nowhere near worth what they charge. I have a pair of Skullcandy headphones which lets be honest is a brand not known for their exceptional quality  theyre midrange quality at absolute best that cost  as much as a pair of Beats Solos and sounds exponentially better.Beats are a shining example of one thing exceptional marketing. Yes they sound like shit. But athletes wear them. Rappers wear them. They arent highend audio devices theyre expensive fashion statements.,gadgets,csdxazz,8,t5_2qgzt

4332259,0,t3_3alsth,I have nothing against Beats charging a lot more for their products than it costs to manufacture as long as the products sell its a free market to do as they please. I gave them a chance and tried them despite what everyone was saying if they sounded good I wouldve kept them but they simply dont sound as good to me as other headphones Ive tried. They sound OK but are far from being amazing. Not to comfortable either heavy weight is not something I want in something I wear for extended periods of time. The only reason of buying them was if i wanted a fashion statement which I didnt. Sound is a lot more important to me so I ended up with a pair of Beyerdynamic DT   a HiFiMan HE and AKG Q. They dont look as good but they sound a lot better.  ,gadgets,csdz3u1,1,t5_2qgzt
4332860,0,t3_3alsth,THeyre fine quality headphones. A bit overpriced but fashionable and well built. I have no personal gripe with them other than when my good but cheaper headphones are put down for not being beats. but thats idiots not the product. ,gadgets,cse1jl9,1,t5_2qgzt
4332964,0,t3_3alsth,First of all audio quality comes from a number of factors.. the speakers where its coming fromcd playercomputerphoneetc.. the source of the audioa cdyoutube videomp downloadetc.. amplifierspower source.. Theres a number of factors involved. So judging a set of speakers starts with what theyre playing from. For a quick example of the difference in sound quality coming from an app just google search pandora sound quality. You very well may not understand what youre reading exactly but it shows a variable in the quality of the audio being streamed. To top things off great speakers will allow you to hear poor audio more clearly thus making something sound worse in general. All in all audio is very much so a sum of all parts.So Beats.. well personally I think theyre a decent set of headphones as far as sound quality and looks are concerned. Would I recommend them to anyone? Absolutely not and not by a long shot. IMO Beats are a ish set of headpones at bestMy frame of reference here is a  pair of Beats the my younger brother got for a birthday present. They are not nearly as impressive as the price tag.Source I work around carhomeportable audio a lot the past few years. Side note if youre looking for a recommendation outside of Beats check out Digital Designs. Good valuable stuff there.

People want to hear what they want to hear and if they are wanting bass over SQ it aint gonna matter what  headphones plugged in to a vacuum tube driven amp on a perfect lossless recording song will sound like.

5091179,0,t1_cuzi8m6,Tracking the pen when its near the screen makes it a pointing device not just a poking device.You and Apple are probably imagining that users will only want to use a stylus on a tablet the same way theyd use a penpencilbrush on paper. More realistically users are going to want to use it the way they use a mouse as well or like the graphics tablets that are well established as essential kit for digital artists even Mac users! and have been for twenty years. Thats how we interact with pro graphics applications.By leaving out the nearscreen tracking they leave out possibilities like Seeing a cursor at all times to remind you what youre doing and what mode youre in. Tooltips that tell you what icons mean before you click on them. Highlighting the fiddly little control youre about to click on so you know youre not accidentally clicking on another fiddly little control next to it. Brushes whose size shape amp exact location is seen on the canvas like as an empty circle or ellipse before you actually make a stroke. Peeking at URLs thumbnails etc. before you click on them. Mousefriendly games where you might like to aim at something without shooting at it inspect something without acting on it or look somewhere without going there. Using your tablet amp stylus to emulate or remote into an OS that requires or benefits from having a mouse. No Amiga emulation or VNC or Teamviewer or Logmein without seriously compromised input.You can certainly use and enjoy a tablet amp stylus without those mouselike features but having those features is much nicer than not having those features.,gadgets,cuzogdv,1,t5_2qgzt

5107327,0,t3_3kygpt,Rice in and of itself does not save your phone. Damage to electronics is caused when flowing electricity is allow to arc to parts that it shouldnt able to and causes  shorts in the circuity as well as corrosion but thats more of a long term problem.Part of saving electronics is making sure that EVERYTHING is dried before it is powered back on. Rice acts as a very cheap and easily accessible desiccant  it wicks moisture from the air like those little packets of silicon you get in bags of food or pills that usually has the DO NOT EAT warning on them. It also encourages you to not power your device on until everything has a chance to dry out.I have had an expensive mobile electronic exposed to a lot of moisture. I was able to power it down very quickly and pull the battery. The device was mostly saved but that much exposure was enough to cause a short in the power button and the USB port so while it works perfectly in most ways turning it on is a bit tricky and Im only able to power it wirelessly.,gadgets,cv1mh0l,3,t5_2qgzt
5107811,0,t1_cv1nkt7,Not really.That K price tag is a few years old and attached to a one of a kind exotic luxury product with no competition at the time and still barely any today. It was unveiled when K was still ludicrously expensive for a TV... when today its barely more expensive than p. Sony could essentially charge whatever they wanted for it because no one else had anything like it. The price doesnt actually reflect the value at all.The projector from LG is certainly cool but its not even K like the Sony projector. Its just p and isnt the first of its kind and thus its priced more reasonably.MSRP of any given device is not at all a good measure of our technological ability. In the late s Avid used to build computers with  worth of parts off the shelf and sell it for  because it was authenticated to run Avid Media Composer.

Theyre unneeded expenses if youre targeting the greatest portion of the market. Sadly you wont find many that are looking to build a niche phone for just the power users. Why set out to create a phone for  of buyers when you can create one for the other  have a far greater customer base appeal and sales?This is how most markets work. The greatest majority influences the entire market. The only way I see around it is that people demanding these things outside the norm like swappable batteries upgradable storage and more will have to be willing to pay a substantially higher price. As it sits right now people arent willing to pay more for those things. Now theyre becoming almost a premium. Valued by those that really need them.,gadgets,cvafby1,2,t5_2qgzt

5268632,0,t1_cvl2sah,Tying is not really applicable here.  Amazon is not saying in order to buy product A you also have to buy product B.  Nor is tying always illegal but since its not applicable I wont get into it.But you are right that you dont need to be a monopoly to run afoul of antitrust laws.  I irresponsibly used monopoly as a shorthand for having a large enough market share to have market power or monopoly power as required for a violation of US antitrust law.  Market power has been defined as the ability to raise prices above those that would be charged in a competitive market.  Monopoly power has been defined as the power to control prices or exclude competition.  Both vague definitions I know.  But thats how a lot of the law is.The first step for any antitrust case is to determine the market.  What is the market here?  Streaming video?  Amazon is not setting the prices here.  In fact theyre giving a lot of it away with their prime serves and I didnt see Netflix or Hulu lowering costs in response.  And Netflix and Hulu probably have a much bigger marketshare at least in use.  I suspect that a lot of Amazon prime subscribers rarely if ever use their video streaming service.Streaming video devices?  Amazon was th last year.   They may have gained some ground since then but I doubt theyd be doing this if theyd become the dominant device.Online shopping?  Amazon is big but theres a lot of competition out there now.  I dont have any statistics on this but I doubt they can raise prices above those that would be charged in a competitive market since a big part of their shtick is low prices.  I dont really see how they could control prices or exclude competition either.  Therere are just a ton of competitors out there including Walmart and Target.  Ecommerce Marketplace?  This is the only one I can think of where Amazon has a monopolistic level of marketshare.  However merchants are not limited to listing exclusively with Amazon.  They can simultaneously list with Amazon Walmart Best Buy Alibaba etc.  So these same merchants are still able to sell chromecasts through other ecommerce marketplaces.  The only way this could meet one of the definitions above would be to limit the market to Amazons marketplace.  And the Courts would never draw the market so narrowly.At least thats my view and my knowledge of antitrust law is a bit dusty.  Id love for an antitrust lawyer to chime in.How would you define the market?,gadgets,cvl4klt,1,t5_2qgzt
5268805,1,t1_cvl4ptw,The question is then how easy are chrome casts and Apple tvs to buy. Apple tvs are easy. Apple is a name brand. Common sense says anywhere and everywhere. Chromecast however not so much for the average consumer. ,gadgets,cvl5dd7,0,t5_2qgzt

When I say some sort of I mean something that will only sell a little and specifically to certain industries and die hard enthusiasts. The thing is gonna be big heavy and freaking expensive. I dont think we will see a general mainstream consumer model for a few years. Same goes for VR. Phone based VR will go mainstream before Oculus or Vive but even then VR wont be for everyone. AR will be a little easier for people but still not everyone will want to use either.The issue with the Hololens is that it is a full computer. It is a standalone device. The VR options out there can afford to be a little less expensive because they dont need to include CPUGPUBattery technology. This will make the Hololens more expensive and will cause it to age a bit faster. I could see Microsoft being very aggressive and selling close to cost in hopes of making up with app sales or getting a jump on the market. I cant imagine this thing will cost less then .

The whole point of an SLR is that you can interchange lenses that are capable of all different things. Really this camera is just a pointandshoot but it uses an aggregate image sensor. Given the picture of the business end of this thing it has no optical zoom so its not going to be any more useful or versatile than your existing phone.,gadgets,cvsnasw,2,t5_2qgzt

5433917,0,t1_cw5zv4n,If you actually clicked on the Imgur links he notes that he is firing the gun using capacitors providing up to V and a psi compression system. High temperature high heat and strong magnetic fields are a recipe for plasma.By virtue of the way this style of railgun works it does end up converting some of the projectiles material into plasma though its really more of a sideeffect in this design and can often be a hindrance to the efficiency  durability of the gun since it can break down both the projectile and the rails and cause melting at the interface between the two as you can see in his pictures  Some railguns actually use plasma as a functional component of the system accelerating the projectile.This Paper goes over some of the differences in design styles of railguns and how very many of them either intentionally or incidentally create plasma in normal firing.gt The second type of armature is a hybrid armature Fig . This design isfundamentally identical to the solid armature except for a  slope at the interface. Thematerial in contact with the rails melts and turns into a conductive plasma which may fill inthe back of the projectile to provide the Lorentz force. Essentially this design sacrifices therear most portion of the projectile to melting while the bulk of the projectile remainsundamaged.TLDRSome redditor wanted to sound snarky and hoped no one would actually think about it.,gadgets,cw68k27,5,t5_2qgzt

5521649,0,t1_cwhd05r,There multiple reasons to why battery life is important. Having a battery that lasts longer than a day is not a ridicoulous request. Heres a couple reasons why.  EmergenciesSay you get in any accident at night before you go to charge your phone and have to go to the hospital. Say your phones dies while in the ambulance. Do you know your contacts number by heart? Some do some dont but it could prove to be a unfortunately situation. This also means you need to find another phone which can be a hassle depending on the situation. You could be walking home in a bad part of town and your phone dies then what? Features are limited by battery lifeSay app developers want to ultilize the new snapdragon processor and p screen to do some cool thing that doesnt matter if you drain half the battery in  hours of using the app. Restricting necessary featuresId say a good phone can make it a day with heavy use but at the end of the day you might have to turn off wifi GPS or bluetooth to make sure your phone lasts til you get home. This is a big hassle IMO. I shouldnt have to regulate my phones power usage halfway through one day of use. The phone should at minimum last one day  hours on heavy use. I guarantee there are several models that cant do this especially if the battery is older than a year. You can argue every which way in that one day of battery life is just fine but in all honesty the technology of batteries simply hasnt kept up with other phone tech CPUs screens etc etc. So here we are in  and people are arguing that one day of battery life is just dandy. Youve got to be kidding right?Weve become accustomed to having a short battery life that most dont care anymore but it does matter more than you think.  ,gadgets,cwhfv97,1,t5_2qgzt

But there are theories everywhere with the same issue. Point is no one is ever going to solve pnp or least I dont think so. ,gadgets,cwmlkg7,0,t5_2qgzt

5708089,0,t3_3t9sjf,Ive almost purchased the Phantom three times now but I just cant bring myself to do it. My problem is that out of the hundreds of available models the only two things I really care about are a live video feed and the maximum range. Dont get me wrong I like flying RC helicopters the little  dollar ones you see at malls at the time now but I really just want to go exploring my neighborhood and other areas from the sky. With that being the case every time EVERY time I read about someone doing something unforgivably stupid with their drone that threatens to ruin the hobby for everyone else it seems to be someone with the exact same user profile as me i.e. someone flying around the drone outside of visual range to see how cool everything looks from a couple hundred feet up.  I dont want to be one of the morons who ruins it for everyone else so I never actually pull the trigger.With the flight capability these drones have their potential for causing danger or destruction when used carelessly and the lack of consistent rules that tell someone EXACTLY what they can and cannot do with their drone I just dont think drones are something any idiot with  bucks to spare should be able to buy. ,gadgets,cx4n76t,1,t5_2qgzt

In addition phones are getting bigger not smaller.                   What do you mean you cant escape physics? What are you violating in making modular phones? The only thing that will soon differ is that there will be modular contacts between components Camera to motherboard.. etc. The SOC part will always be intact and it is considered as one whole component which probably part of the motherboard.

5819594,0,t1_cxif060,I dont think you understand the components involved. The .mm jack is for analog signals. Or rather its connected to analog circuitry. You want to have USBC headphones? So the headphones have to have their own integrated DAC.  And require all normal headphones to have an adapter with a built in DAC? Thatd make things bulky and expensive and horrible for no reason. USBC can function bidirectionally for power and data if you want to get power and data out of your phone just use the port we all agree it should have for power and data anyway. Youre not going to improve peoples experience with headphones by fucking around with trying to put another port on the thing for headphones that would need to be more complicated and expensive for no actual benefit over the current method. ,gadgets,cxih490,1,t5_2qgzt

5895608,0,t1_cxrgs2k,Honestly the Apple case looks like the best option to me for a variety of reasonsThe immediate reaction is look at that hump. But why have excess bulk on the back when its not needed? Why does the entire phone have to be thicker when you only need that much on there for the purpose of the battery? Im not so sold on the idea that the entire device has to be the exact same thickness just for the sole purpose of it being the same. The Apple case still shows the slimness of the device and isnt as big as other cases... failing to see why this is bad. Its arguably ugly to make it this way but to each their own.Other than that built in antennas who would have thought? the Apple cases are excellent in terms of tactile feedback from the buttons and are smooth all around which I think is nice.Also why should a battery case have a switch? So you can choose when to use it? Why? Obviously youre going to turn the case on when the phone is low... so why wouldnt you allow the case to handle it automatically? The Apple case just works and runs automatically. It will keep your phone battery full so when the case runs out it automatically switches to your phone battery... who needs a switch?Lightning connector... this is a no brainer. No extra cables. And why would I want to buy an iPhone with the superior lightning connector only to cover it up and have to switch back to micro USB?

This is compacted that their support is shoddy at best. So you can expect either a huge slowdown in mobile development not gonna happen or lack of support for the Vive platform. HTC cant handle both its just the way their business is. Valve isnt in the business outside of SteamBoxes  even then they are outsourced products of manufacturing and distributing physical technology and HTC has always been very shitty at competing with the likes of Samsung LG and Apple when it comes to volume. Even if the Vive sells out day one they will be backed up FOR MONTHS. They may make a well designed and appealing product but they just dont have the distribution chain to either support demand and eventually create a more affordable product to be competitive withing two years. ,gadgets,cyuqmff,-1,t5_2qgzt

6213869,0,t1_cyvnyhy,Usually modular systems come with a rigid structure. Like desktop PC slot arrays for expansion cards. That rigidity is what makes them look blocky like legos.What weve done is made our modules as small as possible most are mm x mm and the structure is D printed as are the electrical bus and the connectors! That lets us get really organic freeform shapes around modules. We spent a lot of time tuning this and making sure it looks as polished as a standalone product.Turns out getting rid of the rigidity constraint for a lot of consumer electronic products like drones thermostats handheldsecurity cameras makes it possible to build modular products that you cant really tell are built with modules unless you open them up and look inside. ,gadgets,cyvy7kd,4,t5_2qgzt

That doesnt mean the government cannot regulate the sale of such devices under interstate commerce.gtIf you want to design something yourself and encrypt something yourself go for it. Thats not whats at issue here.Absolutely.  It means they shouldnt do so as that bypasses the spirit of the law.  Stopping people from hiding their personal lives is no real solution the problem of a warrant  if it were wed all be okay with  surveillance.  No way to have too little evidence with that.gtWe dont need to. The physical reality of such safes makes them highly unusual so it doesnt pose a significant threat to the governments law enforcement abilities. Strong encryption does.To be clear you think we should ban safes if they become strong and cheap enough to be commonplace?gtNot to purchase it it isnt. Theres no infringement upon any existing right by limiting the sale of devices with full encryption enabled.Full encryption enabled means not specifically restricting encryption capabilities.  Youre literally correct of course but effectively banning encryption has some rather unfortunate precedent alongside it which was my point in giving the examples.gtD printers and similar will absolutely have restrictions as access becomes democratized.But not CNC lathes?  Arguably more effective at creating restricted items like firearms.gtIts sort of the way Photoshop eventually had to build in protections against counterfeiting.They didnt have to.  At least to my knowledge there is no law requiring image manipulation software to include an equivalent to Adobes CDS or even something so simple as recognize the EURion constellation.  MSPaint GIMP and the like would do so if it were.gtPotentially but the barrier of entry needs to be significantly higher in order to meet the States and the Peoples compelling interest in law enforcement.So the barrier to entry is too low for smartphones.  What about tablets?  Laptops?  Home computers?  Professional computers?  Government computers?  Its all the same technology underneath unless you want to make encryption a feature exclusive to coprocessors.The peoples compelling interest in law enforcement only extends to the point where such enforcement can be abused.  I would argue that the potential for abuse set by such a precedent could be damaging on a large scale.gtI dont follow.Free speech and free press have and general literacy had the potential to be ruinous to the government the same as encryption.  They all have a lower barrier to entry too.  That isnt a valid argument to restrict any of them. gtIm fairly certain it was said those would lead to the destruction of things like Monarchies not State power itself.It was said that the Crown or the State in such cases would collapse without censorship and the loss in confidence that coincided.  In one very infamous case the argument applied to the power of the Roman Catholic Church.gtWe wont.

The cable it comes with also has a normal type A connector thats reversible. Glorious. The feel of the cable is nice too. I call it my Fettuccini noodle cable. It doesnt have fast charging but Ive never seen it take longer than  hours to fully charge it. The sandstone back is really nice. It grips really well. Feels nice in the hand metal around the edge makes it feel solid and quality. NeutralI added the Google now launcher because I like it. The oxygen OS works but Id prefer a  stock Android experience. To each their own though. One speaker. It gets loud but my m had dual front facing speakers. Didnt have to cup my hand. More phones need the dual front facing speakers. I miss those. Camera is good enough. Wont blow you away but wont disappoint. I take  second night exposures that turn out pretty good. Got some of the stars and northern lights. Thats all I have right now. ,gadgets,czcysxz,1,t5_2qgzt

6420535,0,t1_czj59eb,Eh thats a pretty bold assumption that it wouldnt make a big difference. It certainly wont change the end result but it would narrow the gap on quite a few of those pictures. If you look at the pictures that dont rely heavily on zoom to get a good composition the most apparent differences are due to color sharpness contrast etc. All the things that RAW is meant to give you control over. To say it wouldnt make a significant difference is to say that postprocessing in a program like Lightroom doesnt matter for pictures which it obviously does. Thats why those DSLR pictures look so good. The unedited output of that camera will still be really good but the editing is what makes the picture pop and look true to life.Of course at full crop the DSLR is going to look cleaner and have more detail. But most pictures someone with a cellphone takes are going to be viewed on a computer screen or small prints where that extra clarity is going to be less obvious. Some of those shots could only be done properly with a camera that has a zoom notably every shot that has to focus through the fences and such. But outside of that a really good smartphone camera can take some good shots if they are edited properly. Thats why so many enthusiasts clamor for RAW support on their phones.,gadgets,czjf4kk,0,t5_2qgzt

But you can put the rootfs on a USB drive and at that point you can just remove the SD card until you need to update the GPU firmware kernel or initrd.But you can load GPU firmware over USB on the compute module In theory this should work on the Pi and with a special cable A A since theres no USB hub in the way. The only firmware Im aware of that you could usefully load this way is the compute module flashing firmware that lets you access the eMMC as a USB drive to reflash it.In theory someone could write a different firmware to load the linux kernel over USB as well but AFAIK no one has ever tried to do that. And it would be more complicated and annoying than just using an SD card for boot.What Id like to see is the ability to load GPU firmware and a bootloader from an SPI flash chip the way normal desktops and laptops store their firmware. I suspect the hardware supports this... but thats only a hunch. Then you could boot to networkUSB without an SD card.,gadgets,d0gmfna,3,t5_2qgzt

However a different LG TV is .You can get a  HDTV from Sony for under  while the commercial displays from NEC and Samsung are in the  range.The biggest problem with commercial displays is that you cant really shop for them.

There isnt really much if anything that can be done to fundamentally improve the bicycle without turning it into something else. There is already a fairly accepted term of ebike for bikes with an electric motor so adding an electric motor to a bike changes it to that. All you really have left is weight reduction and making it more durable for bikes that youd use on a well paved street.

The month before when my friend would usually be at work but took a personal day off the doorbell rang she answered and this dodgy looking guy on the doorstep was visibly shocked that anyone was in my friend sensed it immediately also because they had been two other burglaries in this neighborhood in the last month. The guy started making lame half stuttering and morphing excuses as to why he rang the doorbell and darted away. That next month he rang the doorbell didnt get an answer the housemaid was on the phone in another room and didnt hear it so they jimmied the locks and were again shocked to find anyone home but grabbed her and the phone cord to tie her up.

Its almost like banning drugs makes a violent money filled black market that increases the rate of deaths and reduces an addicts avenues of treatment. I use drugs in this case because it is an example of good intentions paving the path to hell. Just doing something because it might make things better is shortsighted and dangerous. Especially if that side effect is more violent crime. gtI certainly wouldnt call that an inconvenience.Until that database is hacked.

Similar to cash for clunkers campaign If not the old phone will become deactivated and people will have to get the newer model which is tied to your bank account.

It was at that point in time that I removed my cover to reveal that I had forgotten just how much time had passed and that my phone was considerably older than the one Consumer Reports is talking about. I was suspecting mine was one generation maybe two out of date. But instead it was four.  In short  I misjudged just how often they refresh these things. I should have known given how often iphones and ipads are released  but I just wasnt putting much thought into it. I never at any time thought I had a S though. ,gadgets,d1gqkq5,7,t5_2qgzt

7200763,0,t3_4e1wbz,Ive currently got a Note  with  GB microSD and a spare battery with external charger. I always take the second battery around with me because although the newer battery I got lasts well Im a power user and often need the second battery by the time I get home. I disagree in principle with non removable batteries due to the cost of replacing defunct ones when the rest of the hardware remains unchallenged by my needs. So replaceable batteries and SD card expansion is essential to me. I bought the S View wireless charging case because after a couple years of using the USB port for so much recharging its become temperamental i.e. constantly disconnecting when transferring files etc. One benefit of wireless charging many fail to consider is theres no wear and tear on the device in simply placing it on a charge pad versus mating the USB port. The significance of this is more so when you consider how hard it often is to repairreplace a USB port. On the Note  you risk ruining the stylus digitizer to get to it. The G is the most promising replacement for my Note  but without wireless charging perhaps Ill just get another new battery for the Note until the next generation LG addresses that or another manufacturer incorporates the positives of the G.,gadgets,d1wo3cn,1,t5_2qgzt

7359361,0,t1_d2eof79,Well they are more deserving than the poor because generally they work harder hence why they have more money. Also my parents are immigrants and I have nothing against immigrants who want to come here for a better life. Im against immigrants who come here solely to use our social benefits like welfare and who have no intention of ever being a productive citizen. My parents worked long hours for less than minimum wage because like it or not thats the life of an immigrant. Through hard work they went from not having  pennies to rub together to living in a mansion. They earned that. How is it fair they pay more taxes simply because they chose to work harder and longer. Taxes punish the successful while rewarding the unsuccessful. A flat tax would be perfect but no they want the rich to carry the tax burden. And guess what lifes not fair. Not everyone can be rich. For there to be rich there must be poor. Yin and yang. Im thankful that my parents worked multiple jobs and long hours to provide for me. Had they been poor I would have had less opportunities but that would be my life. My whole issue is why should I pay for someone elses education. I paid for mine and as an only child it was technically my inheritance that went on college so in a way I paid for college myself. I would never demand society pay for my gas or my medicine or my college because thats not societys responsibility. Its my responsibility to provide for myself. Plus if they truely worked hard they could easily come out of poverty. My parents did and they barely spoke English. Whats the poors excuse? This is the land of opportunity where everyone can make it if they truely try. Maybe Im biased but Ive met a few spoiled dumb ass college kids that refuse to work more than Part time and than have the audacity to blame the rich for their poverty. ,gadgets,d2epj7r,1,t5_2qgzt

7667957,0,t3_4k9pg6,Ive been staring at a  LG LD for five years being the first person I personally know who realized that  or even  inch monitors were a needlessly small evolution from the traditional inch.  The last two years Ive been waiting for a K to replace it.  I almost bit on the  inch K monitor from Philips but the fact of the matter is that the smaller size would have irked me so I held off.TV makers have their heads up their rearends.  They seem cognizant of the fact that gamers want minimal latency as evidenced by the game mode each and every TV offers but somehow fail to deliver the ltms that every PC monitor boasts even in said mode.  Worse game mode universally abandons  color making it worthless for a PC.  My current TV handles  with about ms latency  easily the best model that existed at the time.In  there was not a single K TV on the market that could do better than ms latency in K .  Why!?  Just atrocious.  I cant say I expect makers to do any better in .  So I will definitely be keeping an eye on this Dell monitor.  The price is terrible of course but it could perhaps be driven down.  As long as it supports HDR Im interested.,gadgets,d3dswxf,1,t5_2qgzt
7668214,0,t1_d3dtt54,ya you could do exactly that   windows all p with whatever program you want.  You just need a computer that can power them and no requirement for any of them to run in fullscreen mode.  My point was only that in comparison to existing technology the dell monitor is reasonably priced since that was the main trust of this part of the thread  thats its reasonable.  And for an extra  bucks compared to a UHD TV for the added capacity to support  inputs AND its an actual monitor seems quite reasonable.  ,gadgets,d3dtyxt,2,t5_2qgzt

7710892,0,t1_d3insqv,gt There is always a demand for unskilled laborIf it doesnt require human interaction a robot can do it. Lifting? Robot.Moving? Robot. Flipping burgers? Robot. Unskilled labor will be the first to go. gt years ago we had unskilled labor manually building and assembling almost all products in factories.  years in the future well probably have an AI indistinguishable from a human. Once we hit that point we no longer need to have any jobs. gtBut that doesnt mean they are destined to be homeless and unemployed. I can imagine there will be job openings for someone to sit a cubicle and monitor automated cars kind of like a call center. Condensation. One person can only drive one car. But one person can monitor  cars. That  times less jobs. Assuming thats even a thing. Googles self driving cars have had what  accidents where theyre not at fault anyways? If you mean monitoring the insides of cars that  becomes  when you factor in the lack of a need to monitor an empty car.  when you profile old lady is less at risk than lowpants buff group of . Even though a lot of the monitoring could be automatic as well. gtMaybe even put on a VR headset and take control of a car if a car needs to drive to an unmappedoff road location. For safety and security reasons this would never happen. To easy to steal the car. And input lag would be unreal. gtOnce there are  million self driving cars on the road then this type of job will probably become minimum wage.Thats also a lot less jobs. If we use the  example thats   people   unemployed drivers. If the  thats   unemployed. They cant take schooling for the software design even though thats nothing new... theyll just contract work anyways.gt Until then humans will be needed to address any kind of limitation of robots. Only in fields where a robot can fail. A restaurant can be staffed by one human  touchscreens  auto cookers. If theres an issue that one human will respond. Still a serious lack of jobs. gtSpeech robots can understand speech like Apples Siri but what about a heavy accent or regional slang words or incorrect vocabularygrammar usage?Picture menus are much easier. Speech is actually not all that needed. Your driving car example could just be a GPS you hit your destination then pay. Then itll move. Also computers can be bilingual. All we need is an automatic language detection software or just a menu asking then boom. Accents gone native language only. Worst case scenario have humans listening to flagged convos to take control. Again thats a  ratio. Youre still removing a LOT of jobs. gtIntelligence I think a lot of decision making will be done by artificial intelligence but there will always be certain situations that they arent prepared for  then they will defer to a human.Again one person can easily manage a LOT of bots. As tech improves they can manage more and more until theyre less reliable than the software. gtunless you have an affordable literal human equivalent robot which probably wont happen for several decades.The issue is software and batteries. Not the intelligence. But again if robots mop clean windows sweep etc. Then youll need less Janitors. Also common sense you spill something you fix it. What kind of privy place lets you spill shit on your desk and lets you call a janitor?gtAnd when that finally happens we will basically have an army of affordable robot slaves that can do anything a human can. And well keep losing jobs in the meantime. Even if a human can only manage two bots in a field thats a halving of the jobs. A halving of income a halving of humanity. We lack the society to keep up with the tech change. We need universal income or state managed housing utilities and food. We need basic human rights given to all. We all have a right to eat poor or rich. We all have a right to shelter poor or rich. Instead though only the big corps will get suto robots and theyll just keep removing jobs until either we rebel or die out. ,gadgets,d3ioddt,2,t5_2qgzt

7914696,0,t3_4nkgr5,this whole issue is fucking stupid. no one wants to buy new headphones for a new port just because the old port was inconvenient for the manufacturer.

7918014,0,t1_d45t88y,but whyyyyyyyyyy??????? I dont want thin tech. It breaks. I put massive protective covers on mine anyway. I like having a headphone jack that doesnt require an adapter that may or may not affect the quality of the sound. I cant figure out for the life of me how removing the headphone jack is going to do anything besides create a space on the motherboard for a ridiculously low amount of memory. Its not like memory is getting physically bigger. It just makes no sense to me unless it is mostly for a design aspect. While having a good design is nice sacrificing things like headphone jacks and antenna size in order to make a phone look better seems like going a off the deep end of radical design.  I guess Im not your normal consumer though. I largely fix my own phones and tech and usually prefer to put my mobile devices even my laptop in thick very protective cases. This means that .

8095370,0,t1_d4pwyap,Audio is stored as a series of signal levels  A CD stores  values samples per second and each sample can have one of  different signal levels bit depth  levels.The DAC takes that digitized information and converts it back into voltage levels.  This signal is pretty weak and wouldnt be enough to drive a headphone or speaker on its own so you then run it into an amplifier to increase the power of the signal.The thing is that DACs are pretty interchangeable  the only real question is whether theyre changing the voltage level fast enough to keep up with the signal or not.  There is some small amount of resistance in the output stage impedance which can oppose changes in signal levels.  However since the signal is so weak there is typically very little impedance.  Its much more of a problem with amplifiers than with DACs since theyre dealing with much more power.  Again pretty much any DAC is good enough since its job is really only to convert those digital signal level numbers to real electrical voltage levels.  They certainly shouldnt be impacting the sound in any meaningful fashion placebo effect is a major problem in this field.   will buy you a DAC that is total overkill for the limits of human hearing and the quality of the input source usually CD quality.,gadgets,d4pzqpb,1,t5_2qgzt

There are programs that can help but even then they cant tell you the exact solution and even then there might not be a program for your specific problem.

8294244,0,t1_d5dzn12,I think something to consider is the turn around time for a vulnerability to be found and then fixed in open source often times beats out proprietary systemsprograms.Windows tends to do patch Tuesdays iirc so vulnerabilities are handled then in many cases. Whereas something like Heart Bleed had a fix published and available in most of the mainstream Linux distros well ahead of the story breaking the news and back ported to all still supported systems. Id look it up but my internet is kinda crap at the moment but you can dig around and find a timeline to when Heart Bleed was discovered and responsibily disclosed to Red Hat a patch written by Red Hat and Ubuntu the public disclosure of the bug and the subsequent code reviews of OpenSSL and the OpenBSD forkrewrite of LibreSSL with more bugs fixed afterwards. This vague timeline might be off since its been a while and Im going off memory but I think it gets the jist of it.With private companies the vulnerabilities often times will sit in a backlog for a while before getting addressed by the security team. In open source the turn around tends to be pretty quick. That honestly is the draw for open source for security for me generally speaking.Now if Linus would get off his high horse and begin taking security a bit more seriously in the Linux kernel and properly label security fixes as such thatd be much appreciated.If you want a good example of open source security OpenBSD is probably the best example of this. It has more to do with their focus on security and their diligence in the matter but due to the open source nature of their project many different projects can and do benefit from their work.That said I completely agree with your point. In theory is a nice thought. In practice different project politics can be problematic and blanket trust of Someone will review it is a bit wishful thinking.,gadgets,d5ec8gu,2,t5_2qgzt

8391624,0,t1_d5qge40, Quick story  Actually Dramamine can be as hardcore of a drug if you take more then you should. Duh. I know. I did when I was  with a friend. You go full blown delusional  although you FEEL normal and can do a bunch of logical things on it.  We got lost somehow in a town we could walk blind folded and lived forever in  minutes from my apartment. Then separated from each other somehow when he went to go take a piss.   Short story?  I went home because it started raining after waiting for him for an hour and a black man in boxers and a bat asked me why I was standing in front of his house.  I spent the entire night seeing ghosts and pulling ticks off my legs and putting gashes in my legs from desperately trying to get them all.   He woke up in the woods dab smack in a pricker field naked cut up from his face down to his lower body so bad covered in blood. We are talking about king sized pricker bushes  The field was so big he couldnt walk through it when he woke up and had to stand for hours till he heard us yelling. He couldnt move or get out. His dad and I only found him because he left a trail of clothes leading to him.   He thought he was taking a shower when it started raining and that he was just outside his dads house. Hence why he was naked. Also he said aliens tried abducted him so he ran. Both of us were experienced with experimenting with everything from acid to DXM and had the will power to know reality versus tripping. With those drugs you feel different and not sober. You hallucinate but you dont become completely delusional. I never did. Some do I would never touch it again. I guess I feel worse and care more for those with mental illness because I now know what its like to be insane. I felt completely normal on it and knew the ghosts were not real. It gave me a sense of security knowing I still could separate reality from illusion.  The ticks however were real  I could feel them see them touch them and hear them burn. I burnt  ticks and flushed them but at no time did I think how are so many ticks come into my apartment? So TLDR Dont be dumb like me also dont ever think OTC drugs are safe. Some of them are DECEIVINGLY powerful Respect them,gadgets,d5qi0wy,1,t5_2qgzt

8436492,0,t1_d5vxpu0,gt I am so sick of the needless hatred for something that could change the world hunger issues. gmos literally caused the world hunger crisis. These companies went into africa and asia in the s and s and destroyed the local economy by first providing cheapfree seeds and fertilizers and then pulled the carpet out under the local farmers and demanded western prices for fertilizers and seeds that third worlders simply could not afford. This destroyed local aggriculture forcing native farmers to either change professions outright die or leave the country.  This caused the first famines which were then fixed by forign aid which put the final nail in the coffin of local self sufficiency because small scale farmers cant  compete with free. Africa is the most agriculturally rich continent on the planet yet it struggles to grow its own food because western intervention destroyed local agriculture and made damn sure it never came back. Western governments throwing aid to random african countries led to a direct breakdown in society creating warlords and violent revolutionary armies who do nothing but go around robbing looting and murdering people. Its really hard to farm under those kinds of conditions and introducing new gmos wouldnt do shit to unfuck that. ,gadgets,d5w3nb4,-1,t5_2qgzt

8564262,0,t1_d6bxlh8,The price point still isnt there for SSDs. The largest sold SSD is TB for around . You can buy  TB HDDs for about . In other words going with SSDs right now is  times more expensive than going with HDDs when dealing with high capacity storage.SSDs are coming along but if you dont need the speed HDDs are still a solid choice for a lot of uses.Edit Also its worth pointing out that large capacity drives have major issues. When the drive fails thats a lot of data to lose all at once. Some data centers mitigate this by purposely using many smaller drives. For example RAID  mirroring two drives is no longer recommended because the odds of the second drive failing before it can rebuild itself on the replacement drive is too high. Most data centers now use RAID  as it has better parity and its more likely the array can be rebuilt before another drive fails and actual data loss occurs but even that is starting to not be enough.,gadgets,d6c40fq,21,t5_2qgzt

8872039,0,t1_d7d6qe8,In marketing we learned successful companies give customers what they dont know they wanted. Remember when they moved the headphone jack from the top of the phone to the bottom or when they moved the power button to the side. Remember when u actually opened your phone with a password not with your finger. Apple is very good at making changes they know people will adapt to. Even if we say we hate it we get used to it and learn to love it. When iPhone  comes out well be saying remember when headphones plugged into your phone. Apple understands people a lot more than you think. They know exactly what lines they can and cant cross and when they should cross them. Also you say  hours of charge is too short but they charge crazy fast.  minutes for  hours of listening . I am sure you can go  minutes without music at some point in your day. Also if you dont like the product dont buy it. The s is still a powerful phone. ,gadgets,d7ealev,0,t5_2qgzt

The dongle is them doing us a favor so we CAN keep using wired headphones if we want which is very unlike them honestly but clearly they dont expect wired mobile audio to be the norm soon.Actually this is completely like them. This is the most apple thing there is. Apple is NOT I REPEAT NOT doing us a favor in doing away with an industry standard connection in favor of a proprietary connection and then selling us an adapter for it so that we can still use our old headphones. When a company is doing something that results in another way for you to give them money they really arent doing you a favor. That goes for any company not just Apple.,gadgets,d7ghgf2,13,t5_2qgzt

Or detailed instructions on how to set up Kodi on an apple TV or a Roku.  Or instructions to turn a raspberry pi into a custom media box.

9091273,0,t1_d84l7uy,In a nutshell both Android and iOS at their heart are Linux machines.   Their kernel uses source code taken from open source Linux and forks in the proprietary code for their UI and hardware.A major bug existed in all forms of nix that the date Jan   at  AM was the zero time and the current time is a counter counting up in seconds from that zero time i.e. one hour after midnight on that day would be counted as  in the code  sec x  min.   If the computers current time is manually set to the zero time the bug causes the OS to lock up and cant function.Apple used the source code and this bug that was known in UnixLinux circles for many years but only patched after chan prankster made a convincing ad that claimed that there was special easter egg from Apple if you set the time to Jan   then rebooted the phone.   It got worse when some dumb kids would go into an Apple Store and set the display models to that time and brick their iPhones meant for their sales display.   Due to the severity of the bug it got fixed fast once the news got out about it.,gadgets,d84mhel,4,t5_2qgzt

So apple is changing the plug you use to use headphones but includes headphones to use that work plus a free adapter for your other headphones. Not seeing the logistics here. And as far as headphones in landfills.... there are already and will always be headphones in landfills regardless. Bluetooth batteries will never be replaced? Wtf are you talking about!? Stuff gets tosses every damn day youre acting like there werent landfills before.... iPhone batteries are no more easily replaceable than headphone batteries by most consumers. None of this has ANYTHING to do with what I initially stated. MY personal preference for wireless and why I think its a step in the right direction. For a business owner you sure are throwing a hissy fit over  persons personal preference.

However when it comes to a network a byte doesnt have any real meaning. You could have a computer with a  bit byte and a computer with an  bit byte on the same network so its ambiguous what a byte is for that network.So when referring to a specific computer such as hard drives we usually use bytes which are larger and easier to use.

Wheres all the puzzle solving?  Where are the games that make you think?  These hardcore gamers are actually the softcore gamers if you ask me because the games they seem to enjoy playing are the least gamelike.

There is more GPU and CPU hardware on these things than over  of the gaming computers on the market.  It is far more hardware than what you would see in a theoretical VR gaming system such as occulus.Every tesla will soon have more GPU hardware than GTX in a liquid cooled form.  A GTX has  cuda cores pascal generation and over  Teraflops of calculation power.  A GTX retails for  to  depending on cooling and whose brand you want to deal with for warranty EVGA MSI ASUS Nvidia direct etcExcept it is not really a GTX but actually a combination of  smaller chips that are far more complicated than a GTX and have more horsepower than a GTX.It uses a modified form of two GTXs  cuda cores pascal generation combined with  custom arm SOCs all talking together and sharing data.  Those custom arm chip are is a mixture of xDenver ARM cpu cores of nvidia design   cortex A and  more CUDA cores of Pascal design. But Remember there is  of these custom chips so effectively you are getting xDenver Cores  Cortex A and  more cuda cores to add to those  cuda cores from those two modified GTX s.Two articles of the CPU  GPU system that Nvidia announced Jan  we learned last week Tesla is now a buyer of this system other automakers are as well.And here is an article from two months ago from a CPU design conference Hot Chips which details those two custom ARM socs that they are tieing to those modified GTXs,gadgets,d95pa6p,1,t5_2qgzt

They most definitely were NOT the first to market with a touchbased phone though they certainly did it better than anyone else at the time and it did largely change the game in that space.  So okay lets stretch things a bit and give em the iPhone as well.  Thats two things barely. What else?  Anything?  Im hardpressed to honestly think of anything else.I agree they do often take their time and they usually do put out products that are pretty good right from the start and that sets them apart a bit.

Thats what makes up the structure of the cytoplasm of a cell and how organelles lysosomes etc. get transported around the cell by cytokinins and such not to mention pulling chromosome around during cytokinesis. The structures I was thinking of are microtubules which are made out of globular dimer proteins. So were gonna have the same conductivity issue unless coupling with some cofactor. Apologies for the error.Yeah youre damn right its scary! Theres a good  min Big Think video about it. Apparently the secret service actually never lets the president leave behind cups hes drinken from for fear of the kind of crazies youre talking about. But yeah building self replicating nano machines is even more terrifying the grey goo hypothesis. Ive heard people say this is something we should ban the research of here on earth only allowing research to occur in spaceon Mars for fear of the runaway scenario you mention.

GHz band You are also assuming that millions of people bought the MBP since its release and bought a HDMI cable while in the next sentence say that you only need a USBA to C cable. So which is it? You also imagine that all people that got a defective cable reported it on apple.com and that no one that got a failed cable did not report it. Basically you take the very dishonest stance of assuming the largest amount of satisfied costumers while minimizing the number of unsatisfied ones.

Ive already run out of sockets in my room to charge my laptop cellphone smartwatch game console controller portable game console tablet and iPod. And thats a nightly task for some of those devices! Batteries also have a bad memory effect leading to devices that last you a year before you toss them in a landfill. Member removable batteries? How about electronics that were built to last? Its all a pipe dream these days. Also dont forget that we are only a few years into lightning ports on iPhones.

9996633,0,t1_dbakkuw,I use emulators a lot. In fact I fire up retroarch and play ROMs far more often than I ever touch Steam or any modern games. But I saw this as a chance to vote with my wallet so to speak. Whether its nostalgia probably is or games from this period just being better and more fun its something I want to see more of. Anytime I get the chance to support something that I enjoy I do it. Not because theres no alternative but because I want to see more things like that made. Honestly it was a fun feeling hooking this thing up and watching my little girl sitting in the floor like I used to and enjoying the same things I used to love that all my friends loved.

Or they can drag it out as long and as painfully as possible and see how many people they can piss off in the meantime. Its their call. Its probably going to happen. And in retrospect its going to look like it happened  product generations too late when it finally does.Edit One more thing.gtYeah that sweet sweet . of profit that they so deeply rely on. Youre gonna have to provide a source on that one buddy. Also dont forget the licensing involved for all the Lightning docks Lightning adapters Lightning car stereo ports etc. etc. A large part of Apples business model has always been accessory sales. The proprietary port was originally an attempt at vendor lockin. Notwithstanding that the  pin connector had extra features that at the time USB did not due to the lack of MHL.

Theyre there to direct people.  If a real security threat came along TSA agents would do absolutely nothing.  They could tackle some moron whos trying to be funny but if someone who really wants to hurt people walks in they are absolutely useless to help.  If there was someone that a TSA agent would actually attempt to stop it wouldnt be a real threat.  Think moron who wants to try and sneak pot through security or idiot who runs through security for fun.  I dont know.  Shit like that literally almost never happens.  There is almost never a time when TSA agents are important.  They just sit there and scan things for you.  If you fly frequently youd understand how little they do and what a sham they are.  They do anything a machine can dousers can do for themselves.Police officers bring real value to society.  TSA agents do absolutely and literally nothing important.

What the journalist did was take the biggest sounding number and reprint it.gtThey had an average of  accuracy when they created a binary classifier using a machine learning technique called discrimination function analysis. So this means they grabbed a small group of two diseases and tried to predict which of the two that breath signature had. Sometimes they got  sometimes .gtFor their healthy control group and picking out a specific disease vs no disease it was as low as thirty percent.What wasnt clear on first read is if this was cross validation accuracy or the test set accuracy which would further lower its power.gtBut  sensitivity for a breath test would be phenomenal. You dont need super high specificity to justify a screening test. However this is GCMS a million dollar k machine which would probably make it rather expensive and impractical.

Dell agrees dispatches a new one and then  days later emails me saying that due to a parts shortage on the line that they will no longer be sending me a replacement and that they will refund me my money so I can purchase a new one for  more than what I originally paid.  Oh and Ive been waiting on my refund since November.  The end.The kicker?  I buy  years of ironclad hardware protection and they couldnt even support their product for  weeks.Say what you want about Apple but in the  years Ive been a mac user  Ive never experienced anywhere near the shitty customer support and quality control of even the closest equivalent PC competitor.

I get that Android phones can be more customizeable but I found that most of my customizations were to fix bad UI more than actual personal taste tailoring. I also couldnt use a lot of Android features due to their intrusive terms and conditions. To use GoogleNow I had to basically give Google permission to look over my entire phone. Apples treatment of data is much more succinct maybe not much better but I know the exact ways they are using my depersonalized data as the Terms are written and organized in a more user friendly manner. Lastly I had to switch to iOS because frankly Apple cares about disability accessibility and Android doesnt. The Android UI is not setup for someone who has limited hand mobility but Apple has these features built in and easynative to use with applications.

It makes sense but its the whole you get what you pay for. We did buy RAM for a couple thousand PCs and noticed the Chinese  RAM was super finicky and unreliable versus even Kingston  RAM. In the end we have just been buying high quality or OEM replacements instead of knockoff stuff. I personally use Amazon basic stuff for almost all of my devices since its cheap and works just as good. I have noticed though that Dell computers are far more likely to want an OEM charger Vs HP. There is even some BIOS built in controller that communicates with the charger and popsup on the screen saying you arent using a dell certified charger so those are exciting. ,gadgets,dczp1ye,45,t5_2qgzt

The active NC is good as long as you have music playing but if you just have the QCs in your ear it doesnt actually really block out much of the ambient noise as well so I feel like its more dependent on music volume to augment  cover up the ANCs flaws.

11053136,0,t1_dekdqcc,gt Google is way better at natural speechcontext processing though.I think thats the big important feature though. Ive heard people talk about having to learn to talk to the Echo for various services. Somebody was saying that his spouse was unable to adjust the thermostat using Alexa because they couldnt remember the superspecific phrasing that had to be used. Theyd say Turn up the heat in the hall or Turn up the temperature in the hall or whatever but Alexa wanted a very specific phrase like Set the thermostat in the hall to X. Theyd try a few times and inevitably get frustrated and just go adjust the damn thing by hand.So I really think that being able to talk naturally to the device is essential for most people. Think about how much trouble people have remembering how to navigate menus and programs that they can see and then compound trouble that by taking away those visual cues and reminders. Its essential that the device learn how to listen to and understand you rather than you learning how to talk to the device. People dont want to have to spend time learning how to use something thats supposed to make life easier. That feels like technology rather than an assistant or aid and most people dont like working with technology.Ive even seen this issue with some IFTTT things Ive set up on my Home. It can be hard to remember what the specific phrase is that I set up to do stuff sometimes I have some custom actions and responses set up to do some specific things.Now that Google has launched their Assistant SDK though more products are getting integrations on the HomeAssistant and more will come. The product launched later and the SDK only came out a couple months ago so it will have to do some catch up on getting integrations yeah. But as the Assistant hits more devices TVs media players phones watches etc. that platform will become still more attractive to develop for and most of your main services will hit it. Given that this kind of home automation hasnt really hit the mainstream yet they still have time for that to happen.Honestly writing integrations is a much easier task than developing natural language processing and Google has some of the best resources in the world to work on NLP Google search all the historical data from Google Now and all their scanned texts and books and documents. I think that should be at least concerning for Amazon.EDIT One other place that Google wins is on design. The Google Home has neutral appearance that fits into a room. It looks like it could be a candle or air freshener or something else that belongs on an end table or shelf. Whereas the Echo devices are all explicitly and clearly technology. I dont think that should be ignored either. It may be superficial but plenty of people are particular about what they put in their living areas and big ugly black speaker cylinder isnt high on most peoples lists.EDIT  I just realized that Google had started to roll out Assistant to Android phones with Android . or higher. Thats a big market and any integration thats written for the Assistant will work on the Home and on the phone or any other device that runs the Assistant. Thats another big advantage over Amazon Googles assistant isnt tied to specific hardware and OEM deals. It can be wherever Android is and thats a big deal for getting partners on board for integrations.,gadgets,dekur8m,2,t5_2qgzt

11070896,0,t1_demqcrj,Im guessing youre automating factory jobs or data entry tasks. Despite the fact that we probably do have the technology to automate almost anything at this point its not cost effective to do it in many many situations. Until AI capabilities jump huge hurdles with automatic learning there are still many jobs that wont make sense to automate for a very long time. So pending the invention of Skynet overnight the other dude is absolutely correct. Technology throughout history has had this same issue. More recently the Industrial Revolution promised to displace everyone but spoiler alert it doesnt because humans always find something else to do. Technology doesnt take our jobs it frees us up for the opportunity to do new things and it has always been that way. Once we have the capabilities to do what youre talking about well also have the capabilities to start really investigating getting things like terraforming more advanced medical treatments real space exploration and all the new forms of art and entertainment that go along with it. People will be displaced and people will need to learn more and stop viewing education as a one time when youre young thing. But this view of a dystopian future where humanity kills itself through its own advancement has been around since society started forming. We survived the steam engine  and well survive robots too. ,gadgets,demvjco,5,t5_2qgzt

If there is please tell me it would greatly reduce my level of fear. Because I am unable to differentiate between a   toy and a   professional. I dont know what drones cost and I have no way of differentiating a costly pro drone from a toy that was self built. You tell me a toy drone has no way of showing me as more then a  pixel figure. It still depends on if I know it is a toy drone. Hell I know it is laughable but just as an example from someone who has never owned or operated any drone and has only once flown a RC helicopter  it was scary if there was painted on the side This drone belongs to mathe green or some side of easily readable number plate I would feel way less pressure. I mean if I have a van staying for four days nect to the flat and I think I recognise a telephoto lens in the back I will call the number in to the local police.

Theyre more reliable and efficient for simply getting work done personally I would hate coding on any nonunixlike system and OS X is the most stable one for a personal computer.,gadgets,dgrz0dw,2,t5_2qgzt

They are mechanical units and the chance of breaking down becomes higher as they get older. And in  years time hard disks will be faster and of higher capacity as well.Btw mtbf values of several brands can be found on Google. A manufacturer called HGST has been using helium for a long time and has one of the best reliability markings.,gadgets,dgt9xqn,4,t5_2qgzt
11765594,0,t1_dgtjiwo,Anecdotally Im still using a Note  and aside from new batteries it has cost me nothing for more than  years now. Thats a long time in mobile tech and yet I see no reason to upgrade it as with Lollipop it supports every popular app and still performs excellently I can have a torrent client running in the background whilst having Reddit and YouTube open in two windows and everything still runs smoothly.In my experience Samsung dont do planned obsolescence their phones have considerable longevity. Remember Android does slow down over time and benefits greatly from the occasional factory reset to clear any accumulated shite. Im fairly certain they havent removed any features with updates they have probably just moved or been renamed.Their phones are expensive because theyre damn good. I dunno if youve held an S but they feel like very sturdy pieces of equipment. If you want cheaper go for one of their lowerend models like the Galaxy J or A series.The Sseries is flagship. You cant moan at them for making them as flashy as possible. If your kids are annoyed at the degradation of their Samsungs performance theyll be gobsmacked at an iPhones. Try using a S nowadays and youll see what I mean.gtlike their friendsThatll be why. I finished high school in the UK a few years ago when the  was current. Witnessed more than one kid being bullied for being poor because they still had a GS. iPhones have the cool factor doesnt make them better phones.,gadgets,dgtnrzw,1,t5_2qgzt

Thats why you dont use HDMI wall plates because of the additional insertion loss.Also its EDID error on the low speed data channel not HDCP.  Sony isnt any different than any other AVR manufacturer.  Besides if youre using a HDMI cable longer than  feet youre looking for trouble.  Use a HDMI extender or better currently HDMI over fiber from Celerity.I guess there really is a reason for those expensive HDMI cables huh?  Monoprice  trash.,gadgets,dgx0gpi,-1,t5_2qgzt

He was pretty worried that hed get stuck with the Osprey since he joined the Marines. Lucky for him hes flying fs today.Edit I got to add that the coolest part was having the FBI call me shortly after graduation asking me about of questions about him. Its all part of their security clearance process. It was a lot of questions about how much he drank and what not. I may have fudged how wasted he got on a couple occasions but the FBI bought it and hes now protecting our country. Go Milk Man. That was our call sign for him since he would be making deliveries and hooking up with housewives. Although he got married during training... what an idiot...,gadgets,dgyiz0h,15,t5_2qgzt
