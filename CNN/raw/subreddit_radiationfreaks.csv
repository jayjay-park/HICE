6580024,0,t1_czzo51k,Its a cool little unit built around a in pancake tube.  That tube is whats important.  The LND  tube the onix is built around is the same used in many excellent units.  Ludlum and RadEye are two of my personal favorite instrument brands.  Theyre top end and expensive though and neither one makes everything I want or has all the features so I have a mix.If you want to use radiationnetwork.com then look at their compatibility list but otherwise buy it and start learning.  Dont get excited with a few hundred CPM with that in tube.  It may be higher than background but it can still be a perfectly natural source.  Nothing irritates me more than someone waving around a geiger counter declaring theyve detected radiation from Fukushima or from source x while standing on a beach thats naturally radioactive.,radiationfreaks,czzxfbf,1,t5_3bp32
