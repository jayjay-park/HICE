4436583,0,t1_csprcmw,I dont know about his right. But it is his choice. I dont understand why more and more developers are starting to take that road of bombardment of ads and unskipable video ads.I can understand if they want more people to buy the ad free version. But there are people who either dont have the money or cant purchase for other reasons who use the ad supported version. Forcing tons of ads on those people just makes them resort to piracy. Once that happens the developer has really lost out. Now they dont get money for ads and dont get money for the app either.And of course there are always people who are going to pirate regardless but a developer should not want to force people into a corner and create more pirates.Personally I bought relay back before the name change a while ago. Simply because I like it and use it daily. It is in my opinion the best Reddit app out for Android.

And if it were to overlay something over the Installbutton which makes you think that youre pressing something else then youd press the Installbutton without knowing and with that potentially install malicious software.So Android just disables the Installbutton as long as theres an overlay onscreen.Thats why Lux has the System Installer in its blacklist by default.,RelayForReddit,cw11rh0,13,t5_37m8x

So I offer my help in implementing ad blocking in it.As I understand you use WebView as an internal web browser. We can provide you with a component for blocking ads within it.The whole thing consists of three things. shouldInterceptRequest. Thats an easy part well simply block ad requests.. WebView.evaluateJavascript or any other way to execute JS in context of the web page. Well need this to apply cosmetic rules to the webpage and sometimes to handle antiadblock scripts.. An update mechanism something like checkFilterUpdates methodSo here is my proposal. We provide you with such a component including the source code of course..
