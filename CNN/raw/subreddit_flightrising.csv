97777,0,t1_cepjz8m,Akiri is doing very well. I had a chance to fly out and visit him for a couple days and each day I was there he looked a little bit better. Hes in good spirits and we had a very nice time catching up. We are all very excited for his progress.,flightrising,cepk8az,16,t5_2wkv7
1161765,0,t3_27eobg,I caught this registration by a day. They announce it about  days in advance but do so very quietly and subtly. TBH I wouldnt have caught it if I wasnt a frequent watcher of this subreddit and didnt get to see this post.,flightrising,ci0bfkh,1,t5_2wkv7

1286869,0,t3_28seww,Whats degrading about making a character female just because you neededwanted another female?Unless the setting is extremely genderbiased which I havent noticed in the flight rising world changing the gender of a character shouldnt be that difficult. Your hypothetical dragon warrior could be female just as easily as male and it wouldnt degrade anything. Plus it always seems like whenever people say well you just give them whatever gender fits the character the gender that fits always just so happens to be male. Or a horrendously stereotyped woman.And about agendas? Most people that game would consider videogames to be a legitimate art form. Its thousands of hours of visual art writing and music combined! But there is where the burden of art comes in Art always says something. Authors write their characters with their own agendas all the time! Thats writing! Artists design their characters with the features they have because the artist is trying to say something about the character. Flight risings only current theme may be we fucking love dragons but that doesnt mean they cant express girls are also human beings that matter off to the side with their character ratio!,flightrising,ciee0k8,5,t5_2wkv7

3868624,0,t3_34r0fd,Gen  hatchlings have a single actual advantage. Subjectively people might like them for other reasons RP challenges etc but the only mechanical benefit is that they can breed with anything on the site.If theyve been bred before that advantage essentially disappears which is a huge blow  and it messes with a lot of other challenges lore etc as well.Essentially theres some stuff thats special about a brand new G but theres nothing special about a bred G.,flightrising,cqx993h,5,t5_2wkv7

7004763,0,t1_d1a9wgm,Light is indeed extremely good at dom. We beat Plague in a huge battle recently and theyre usually regarded as the big dom powerhouse. Light isnt always pushing but we do a lot of exalting for profit so we tend to get second and third place fairly often even when we hadnt planned any sort of organized push. Nature won a dom battle recently too against ice though Ill admit that I know little to nothing about how dom works in their Flight.Dom battles are totally optional to participate and Light doesnt conquest push try for dom at all costs all possible help needed very often. Most of our pushes are very relaxed more of an optional thing for profit than anything else.Though I only know in depth what the Light community is like very friendly if a bit small Nature seems like a quite friendly Flight as well. Both Flights are great choices. Maybe if you cant decide use the look of the deities as a tiebreaker?Best of luck!,flightrising,d1ac1p9,3,t5_2wkv7
7268467,0,t1_d24aq29,Well. Its a breed of dragon which falls under the plentiful category so its not worth much from that alone. The eyes dont really compliment the body colour everythings the same dark shade of blue with the exception of smoke so the details wont show up as well a problem which is compounded when combined with the small size of the dragons artwork a larger breed of dragon may showcase the genes much better and  gems is far too much for any dragon given how flooded the market is and has been for a while. Just because its XXY and has newer gene patterns doesnt mean that its valuable which Im assuming is the reason for the huge price tag. Sorry.,flightrising,d24dhvb,2,t5_2wkv7

8517429,0,t1_d62iqve,I dont think you understand the OPs point here at all. Being a nub myself I find it very upsetting that older players are being very very generous only to be taken advantage of. Yes after you givesell a dragon to someone else they can do whatever they want with it. But its very rude to get a free dragon from someone trying to help you get started only to exalt themsell them right away. ,flightrising,d668lng,3,t5_2wkv7
