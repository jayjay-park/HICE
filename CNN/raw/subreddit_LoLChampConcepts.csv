103946,0,t1_ceq49xf,Sorry! I just think Raka is a poorly designed champion and is an artifact from LoLs early days. Im excited to see how Riot revamps her kit to be a bit more interactive.,LoLChampConcepts,ceq9kmf,1,t5_2t7e7

516066,0,t3_1zzmdm,The Lee Sin changes are bit to early to tell but people are definitely underestimating the passive change. Im not a particular fan of the other changes and I feel like the inherently damage the champion people love him for. I can understand wanting to smooth power curves out but I disagree with making sure that every champion can scale into the lategame. Strong Lee Sin players are far from useless in the lategame and I think the shift in his kit from early game dueling to late game sustained damage is a pretty drastic shift in power.The Skarner changes themselves arent particularly bad and I think most people whining that hes terrible are just jumping on the DAE RIOT SUX bandwagon. The biggest problem with the Skarner rework is that hes boring. His kit feels so incredibly bland that theres no unique flavor to him anymore. I think the Q change is awesome I really like the attackspeed stacking mechanic and agree his permaslow needed a change. The new W feels incredibly underwhelming. For how long it takes  to ramp up and how easy it is to strip away the MS boost is very low. I can understand Riot not wanting to have Skarner fly around the map at a button press but this MS boost is rather piddly. The shield also is too damn weak on its own. I think reducing the rampup time andor increasing the MS speed would help this ability. Alternatively grant the shield scaling with some other stat  health resists hell even movespeed  so that it can encourage Skarner players along a specific route and not have a shield that poots out after a small gust of wind.His new E is definitely strong but holy shit is it boring. It feels lame to use. Theres not high impact oomph feeling behind it. You just kind of barf out this blue projectile and suddenly people move slower. again very potent ability just very very boring to use. Its a pretty generic AoE skillshot slow. Its effectively an Olaf Q with worse damage significantly worse CD timers an a marginally improved slow. Again not a terrible ability just boring. And thats new Skarners issue  hes super boring and bland. ,LoLChampConcepts,cfyxhus,2,t5_2t7e7

595633,0,t1_cg7iv1z,Well while I can see a similarity to Syndra in the whole placementmoving objects gameplay I think theyd be a bit different for mostly two reasons. The boxes move slower. The idea is that they can be avoided as they are moving while with Syndra it is more of an anticipation based on her position relative to the orb. This makes Volts gameplay more continuous and about trying to trap the opponent rather than eliminate them in a combo.. Syndras orb relative to her push ability has more of a CC focus stunning and has a pretty long cool down. Volt on the other hand primarily manipulates the boxes to do damage and has a shorter cool down making it more continuous gameplay.,LoLChampConcepts,cg7z72r,1,t5_2t7e7

Leap should probably be used for positioning rather than damage imho.. Reduce the mana cost of void armor. Paying  mana for  spell on a champ who doesnt build mana is excessive. with leaps mana increased mana should more or less balance out,LoLChampConcepts,chfu6p6,1,t5_2t7e7
1111779,0,t1_chuio20,Thank you for your input! I was starting to think nobody would ever notice this concept. So Im clearly not the best when it comes to numbers and thats exactly why I posted this here.For her Q I had trouble. I didnt want the true damage number to be too low otherwise it just felt useless. At max rank Vaynes true damage from Silver Bolts does . damage minimum as in on a champion with Anivias base health and no additional HP and . maximum damage Alistars base health no additional HP. So I tried to make it a bit lower than that but give it some scaling. It shcould probably be much lower on the scaling...Bases are annoying. I feel like if I make them too high theyll be well too high. And if I make them too low but with higher scalings theyll be able to snowball as you said. I guess I didnt hit the right chord...Addressing the ER combo the two spells are intentionally made to overlap. I should probably come up with actual travel speeds instead of . and  seconds but  gap closing range was too much and I knew that. In the first paragraph of the discussion section I mentioned the interaction saying None of her abilities interfere with each other in that respect in reference to the ebb and flow movement though using her E max range to get in range for her ult recast more quickly takes up the  second of time to recast her ult intentionally.Dashing the  units takes up essentially over in my mind. Thiss the part I should have made more clear  second which is also the timer on the ultimate. gtbut . AP is an ult ratio not a normalDo you mean like the scaling itself or just the number? There are nonultimate abilities with scalings above ... Annies Disintegrate and Incinerate have scalings of . and . AP respectively. Where they differ is they start low and then get large boosts in their bases each level going up to  for Disintegrate and  for Incinerate. I sort of just realized that Sjels Q damage is essentially split in half at rank  but is pretty much doubled at rank  with the true damage. I should fix that.In the Riot Guidelines thread it says gtRatios generally tend to add up to a certain value. Annies ratios add up to . AP instant  . AP over time. Brand adds up to . worst case with . best case single target which is very hard to achieve. Generally . is reliable. Orianna adds up to . AP with an additional . in shield for . total. These values are all roughly in the same margin on every caster which tends to range from . to . for reliable damage.The current scalings line up at . AP. What Im thinking now from the points you gave and my responses is up the bases of E and W lower the scaling and base damage of the true damage on Anima before level  at least and nix or reduce the damage of and limit further the range of Planeswalker.Also fix that formatting issue with the W and E. Ugh.,LoLChampConcepts,chuo1i5,1,t5_2t7e7

1237751,0,t3_289udu,I love the idea of flexible champions but let me tell you something. Stancebased champions have some issues that must be avoided if you want to create a succesful champion. First of all you must not create a smashthekeyboardtowin champion. This is not your case of course with  minutes cooldown on your stances you must use change your stances wisely. Sona instead has this kind of issue where the reward to use the Power Chords correctly exists but is very low. Ironstylus or some other rioter has already mentioned that they are looking forward to create more smart gameplay. On the other hand if your champion benefits too much from passives and isnt rewarded when using skills you create a passive champion. Passive champions are extremely boring and have limited playstyle. Basically no one wants to sit in lane and rightclicking everything in front of them unless you are teemo or caitlyn.This is the main issue with your champion you may only use one skill per stance meaning that when you need another skill you know that you will not be able to enter in the other stance for  minutes. Example you are maxing R but in this instance you need CC. So you switch to position Q but for the next  minutes you wont be able to use the skill you have maxed out.Now let me introduce you Ibojor the Elemental EremiteThis is a champion I have created a long time ago when I was trying to create an elementalist champion while keeping the stancebased design of Udyr.Heres how it works Ibojors passives revolve around a rotation of spells which is firegtwatergtearthgtairgtfire...If you follow the rotation you gain a lot of benefits basically a passive skill for each successful step in the rotation.But if you dont want to follow the rotation using basic skills will still work but you wont get any bonuses.This desing creates more active gameplay than Udyr or Sona but you are forced to follow the rotation. This is a vary bad thing because you dont want champions to follow one single pattern when playing them Fuck Nidalee.Plus it would be more interesting to create a champion that has different skills for each stance and with skills I mean skillshots targeted abilities and so on which Udyr doesnt have beacuse his design doesnt allow him.This is why I revamped Ibojor in a new designIn this case you still have  stances that give passive bonuses but the active skills are different for each stance. In fact every stance has  active skill plus a fourth which is used to exit from that stance. Every skill is basically what you get from combining two elements. In my case|Q|W|E|R|||||||Fire|Water|Air|Earth|If you press Q to enter fire stance your abilities will look this way.|Q|W|E|R|||||||Exit Fire Stance|WaterFire Skill|AirFire Skill|EarthFire skill|if you workout every combination you get six abilities||Fire|Water|Air|Earth||||||||Fire|Exit Stance|Steam Spurt|Blazing Fists|Lava Armor||Water|Steam Spurt|Exit Stance|Mist|Mud Wave||Air|Blazing Fists|Mist|Exit Stance|Sandstorm||Earth|Lava Armor|Mud Wave|Sandstorm|Exit Stance|The point is how do you want to play?Bruised AD?          Max Fire and Earth StanceSupport?             Max Water and Earth StanceMelee AD carry?    Max Fire and Air Stancethe capability to have  abilities plus the passive you need everytime on the game makes this design very flexible.The problems are that its very complex and it offers way too much to a single champion.,LoLChampConcepts,ci8v395,2,t5_2t7e7

1322782,0,t3_297kci,Part of designing champions is giving them fresh unique identities. Your kit is interesting but I think youre falling short on the champions overall identity and heavily invading Zacs identity. We already have a big green goopy dude in the league who uses his gelatinous form to attack his enemies and defend his allies. You kind of took steps to avoid this by making him more jellylike but I think ultimately youre treading in territory already claimed by another champion. ,LoLChampConcepts,ciifhg0,1,t5_2t7e7

1360844,0,t1_cimslth,Interesting I could see the beetle being on him giving him some addition armor and MR similar to how Jannas Zephyr gives her movement spd or Tarics Shatter gives addition armor to him and allies and when he uses that ability its that beetle that goes away removing the passive bonus. You could also have it explode after a period of time or on recast whichever is sooner to give it that extra umph of usability.Okay I can see how he could be played in that manner. I could see him being used in a variety of scenarios in that case. ,LoLChampConcepts,cimvdyk,1,t5_2t7e7
1421619,0,t1_ciufu4n,Ive addressed a few of these issues in my other reply. I think Tank might be a better class for him.Once Nakal reaches the end game his Q causes a  second debuff and with  cdr is up every  seconds. Although the bonus damage might not be much the nearly permacripple is going to be noticeable if he manages to catch someone out.The W has been explained a bit better in my other reply id be willing to go into more detail if you have questions from there. I understand its not perfect but I think this is the iconic trait that sets him apart from the other roster the trait that you suggest is missing from his kit.The E is a basic gapcloser youre right. The bonus health is playing off the concept that tigers launch their full weight behind an attack when hunting to take their target off balance. It applies on hit effects so that Q can be combod in and emphasise this idea that youve just been launched at by something far bigger and stronger than you and that its going to slow you down. The one that I do both agree disagree with is the comment about the ultimate. While yes handing players free stats isnt great game design because of limited counterplay ultimates are meant to define a champion and give an allied team an upper hand. Sivir grants bonus move speed to allies. Soraka gives global heal. Karthus. Nakal is bolstering both the offensive and defensive capabilities of all his team for a short period need to update the post to reflect this and the cooldown for this is reduced if he activates it in combat. Because the duration is low he cant trigger the reduced cooldown by fighting in the jungle and then rushing to the fight afterwards because that would reduce his teamfight strength.At the same time he could trigger the reduced cooldown by attacking lane creeps and then rushing to fight. If you see Nakal in midlane fighting creeps with his team behind him that would likely be indicative that hes about to ult and go ham. The issue then would be weighing up whether he cares about the passive reduction and whether it might be better to give it added bonuses for activating in combat full buff versus activating it out of combat only mrarmor buffLet me know what you think thanks for the feedback too!,LoLChampConcepts,ciuh7ax,1,t5_2t7e7
1441491,0,t1_ciwgfzl,Yeah. Well to clarify  I really missed those champions which had a lot of relations to others  Look at Garen  He has Katarina whole Demacia Urgot etc. Now look at Lucian who is supposedly Demacia  he has Senna and Thresh. He might have more relations with champs on The Shadow Isles but we will never know because no JoJ. Maybe he hates Elise as well who the hell doesnt hate spiders . but we cant know. This champ on the other hand has  champions in just his lore. All of them are in the game. He might or might now have  more really really important character in it which is linked to the watcher and god. Although he is nothing like a Darkin he is a race for himself which also watches.Im really happy you figured the Zed part but as for the Yasuo part its pretty much clear that Riven killed his elder somehow Three swift strikes although I really didnt want to believe it I wanted a romantic RivenYasuo relationship where the love comes from them both being betrayed somehow ltVelKoz  I dunno  I really wanted him to be crucial but somehow he is just different from all the torchering the Void has I really just didnt like him because he wasnt given as much attention as other Voidborn got Kha x Rengar Kog has a dad Kassadin vs Malza has a daughter Malzahar and his cult Cho with his Cho eats the world etcetcOK about his passive  He keeps losing the buff as long as he is in range  This is to somehow force him to use his Q to do something or just run away. Hence his watcher attribute him being more like a scout.Oh and the damage from the ulti is in waves.,LoLChampConcepts,ciwytq9,1,t5_2t7e7

If his Ferocity did infinitely stack hed be able to get around  and at lower levels when he needs to use skills more often at each camp a full jungle clear would definitely be able to get  seeing as they have no cost and he wouldnt need to reserve any resource.

The public survey rates the entries seperately. A scoring method is important too such that if both judges agree on a winner the public survey cant overrule them but if the judges disagree on who should win the public can swing the vote.Allowing the survey to choose what the the judges review partially preserves the problem the system is meant to eliminate because an unaccountable public vote can still allow weaker designs into the finals while stronger designs are removed.,LoLChampConcepts,clvzhoj,1,t5_2t7e7

3086312,0,t1_cohpv83,One of my earlier ideas about that problem was to make the Q proc the stun on hit and make her ult a skillshot that would proc the fear on hit both after  stacks of course. I felt like this mightve been too much in the opposite direction seeing as skillshot reliant champs like Ezreal and Xerath are somewhat weak in the current meta due to the inundation of mobility overall.

3147602,0,t1_com1g2h,Thanks for the input. I relooked at some of the damage ratios and yeah her jots pretty OP. Ive lowered all the AP ratios on her ult. Her ult on a single separated Champion is now a somewhat less potent version of Malzahars ultimate it has higher base damage but less scaling. Her lightning is also a way less potent version of Katarinas ult Kats damage is ridiculous. Now Im only worried that she might now actually have to little damage and the reason is ANNet isnt designed to be Malzahar Katarina and definitely not Kennen. I dont want to add RNG because I feel like that is a part of why Kennen isnt really used that often.  Katarina is of course part of the inspiration for Eletric Surge but there are some big differences between them. Katarina does a ton of damage at the expense of being in close range and being easily disrupted ANNet is also able to be disrupted but less easily so. However one of the best things about Katarina in my opinion is because with Shunpo she can go in and fuck up your team without warning. ANNet on the other hand has a very short window in which to activate her ultimate. This is in my opinion the purpose of the contest making abilities that would be incredibly over powered but giving them very strong limitations. If Yasuo could select a  radius area and ult all enemy champions within it without any sort of constraints he would be far too strong but. By adding the knockup limitation he becomes balanced.Back to ANNet Electric Surge has a very small window during which it can be used with a taletell sign of when shes going to use it. This gives the enemy team a choice of whether to go in and take ANNet down before she can do anything or back away themselves to keep from dying. This is a major theme in my design for ANNet. She does a ton of damage but her damage is not reliable. A big part of the damage for her Q requires her to land a second Q within the  second time period. Her W does a ton of damage but only if her target remains within the field for all four seconds though I will say that is possible with her ultimate. And Magnetize was designed to be a root with an escape. The slowing period is not supposed be a form of extended cc but rather a period in which an enemy should be able to dash or flash away. Of course with this being a paper kit her abilities could be way more reliable than I am thinking but that was the idea behind the design. Also as for her Q I think making that charge switch be based on time would be far more cumbersome than just being mp based on use. You would have to watch your bar for when it switched rather than just mentally noting which charge it was last on.,LoLChampConcepts,coo8usz,1,t5_2t7e7

Also it makes no sense for Urgot to become melee when his target is close and ranged when his target is far away thats basically just regular ranged.

3543363,0,t1_cpvz6cg,I can understand that perspective. It just felt like a pretty natural explanation for events.  I think I agree on the passive.  Because Ariane has higher potential dps than almost any champion in League from my math shes up there with lategame hypercarries for potential damage which is what I had in mind and most of that already came from her E I wanted a spell that wasnt too strong for her W as she already got quite a bit of defensive utilty from it. So I gave her a decent magic resist shred and a basic vision tool. It is a long cooldown but I dont think its really an issue  I think it would be manageable. Its definitely a bit of a skill floor but I dont think it would be too much harder if at all than microing for champions like Vayne or Zed. Also note that where it will pop out relative to you when you Q is actually quite predictable for example since E rotates once per second outside your ult and the Q delay is . seconds it will always appear on the opposite side to where it initially was. And I feel the weakness to being crowd controlled is justified since she is very good at kiting and has the tools to avoid most crowd control. She will simply have to fear a Warwick or Malzahar counterpick. As to the mana cost it was based around Karthuss defile cost which is technically the most similar ability to it and I was planning to keep her heavily mana gated.  How you described Q should work is what I actually intended sorry if I was unclear since the cooldown begins on activation and if you activate it within the area it should have that effect.  And yes I do prefer mechanically detailed champions. I feel that the primary thing that distinguishes League of Legends from over ARTS games such as DotA is the mechanical focus where League feels in some ways like a hybrid between the earlier standard of the genre and a fighting game and since I enjoy mechanically rich champions I prefer to focus on that aspect.,LoLChampConcepts,cpw5zp1,1,t5_2t7e7

3921958,0,t1_cqvov8v,gt Q Lunacy Rykan spins around kicking his target and dealing   physical damage.This is all I really have as far as scalings go. I wouldnt know what a balanced percentage scaling would be for a champion like this.For the E imagine it charging up passively similar to Threshs Flay passive. Using it would be similar to Shens taunt. Its sort of a dash the animation would make it look different though  It would deal  damage to the last target hit. If he hits a champion it would deal  damage to the last champion hit. His Q is a target ability. BUT it applies on hit effects Frozen Mallet Shiv etcI actually hashed out this concept before the jungle was changed. And I can definitely see him being strong top lane. I would probably give him TP  Ghost and allow him to roam a lot.The current tank meta is not the place for him in the jungle. But I could see the jungle meta changing soon. Last time Feral Flare was meta it took a while but it was soon replaced. Cinderhulks flame is dying down a little bit I think. It will change soon if the past is any indicator. Maybe then Rykan can be the king of the jungle.I hadnt really put in the detailed amount of the passive because I want him to remain balanced. I felt as if I had created a number it would either be too low to not be a very good passive or exceedingly generous and make him absolutely broken. Leave it to your imagination. Strong but balanced!Thank you for reading. Im glad you enjoyed it!,LoLChampConcepts,cr3c8c4,1,t5_2t7e7
3928770,0,t3_35g5rr,His build certainly sounds interesting Id imagine he would be built half carry half tanky. He needs crit chance to become really good but he has no mobility so he needs tank stats. Something like IEPhantom dancer into youmuustank stats sound intersting.

4496723,0,t3_3cggr6,His Passivegt How long do these buffs last? They seem pretty easy to apply You say they apply stacks of Changing Tide but no other ability seems to actually refer to these stacks and you dont identify a duration for them or any other interaction with them except the buffs they provide to Franklin. Mark is usually the term used for things like that.gt However if youre going to keep Changing Tides I think you could do better to integrate it into the rest of the kit. Not a lot of his kit really requires his attack speed to go up except maybe W or his movement speed to increase Since all his abilities are ranged so its not clear what the real benefit of it is except that he can stick to a target and basic attack more. But he seems to want to build AP and none of his abilities help his basic attacks do more damage routinely except his W passive to a small degree. His Qgt The ideal use of this would appear to be pointblank range so Franklin can benefit from the heal. Im not sure what the duration for this ability means. Ostensibly its just a projectile but if it takes  seconds to reach its destination its never going to see use. Additionally I think you should use the LoL Wikia for reference points on numbers because this ability and most of yours have very strange scalings. The base values are generally low and  of AP is almost nothing particularly for an AP Fighter. Did you mean ?His Wgt When you say like Veigar do you mean that the spout only knocks up enemies at its edge? That seems counterintuitive. If you mean that the whole area is knocked up after  second ChoGaths Q is a better reference point. In fact ChoGaths Q is very similar to the active portion of this ability. gt The passive component seems weak. Its very intermittent true damage that I dont think will amount to much. If you list him as an AP fighter you need to give him more ways for his ability power to be relevant with his basic attacks. Diana if viewed as an AP fighter only has her passive to help her in this but its a very good passive and she can make fine use of Sheen with her relatively lowcooldown abilities. His Egt Whats the range of Franklins teleportation to the anchor? Could he toss is far behind him run up do some damage to an enemy then instantly retreat to safety a la Zed? gt On the whole this seems like a pretty standard ability. Not much here to find wrongdoing in except that the buff values are a little low. I assume its main purpose is to give Franklin a gapcloser and in that it serves well enough. You should specify whether he can only transport to it once. His Rgt Yo you got any crackers?gt What is the range of his cannonball attacks? Do his basic abilities change at all during this time? I expect that his W probably should since it is also influencing his basic attacks. The targeting disparities confuse me the other champion like Franklin in his tagteam sort of ult is Quinn. Valor keeps Quinns stats including health. If youre looking to make him beefier during this time just state that his defensive stats increase by some amount instead. gt Can he end this early if he wants to?gt The passive and the active seem entirely unrelated. I dont think that helps this character form a coherent identity. In Generalgt I see Franklin as an unfocused character. Hes an AP fighter but most of his abilities put him at range dont provide him with much survivability and dont provide any good way of ensuring that his AP builds contribute to sustained damage. As an AP fighter APbased sustained damage should be pretty high on Franklins list of things he wants. Currently Franklin is just a closeranged mage and thats substantially different from an AP Fighter.,LoLChampConcepts,csxgvhr,2,t5_2t7e7

4673494,0,t1_ctit3u7,Leonas passive was designed to force her into a support position.  Because if she could proc it herself she would  be played top or jungle.  And comparing Luxs passive to Leonas would be appropriate if you take them at face value but when you consider that they accomplish different things its not.  Lux is a long range mage.  Her passive is a way to encourage her to step out of that  range that she could comfortably stay at without it.  Leonas passive is meant to encourage cooperation and gate her damage without a teammate.  Not to mention Leona is a tanky cc bot while Lux is a ranged pokeburst mage.  Totally different scenarios.Ahab is not perfectly capable of proccing his passive by himself.  He has no way to enter that range if the other team doesnt allow him to.  He has zero way outside of his own relatively long CD ult which puts him at risk and given its range should be relatively avoidable with proper play to force that scenario.  With Braum its difficult but he is definitely capable of stunning on his own especially since he has mobility the slow from his Q the MS boost from his shield and his ult knockup and slow to help him do that.  Kalista does have a reliance on her team so does kogmaw.  But the difference is that they dont get reduced to mindless AA bots without their team.  There is other gameplay.  Kalista still has to skirt the edges of fights and kite and use her passive well.  She only really loses the passive from her W and her ult while alone.  Kogmaw still has his whole kit hes just extremely vulnerable to getting dived.As far as Ahri  is quite close range for a mage to enter even if she has mobility.  And minor thing with her W for all three to hit instantly the actual range is somewhere closer to  since the spell range is calculated from where the flames are not her champion position.   is stupid close for a mage to get into.And yes he does lack mobility and I agree it wouldnt make a ton of sense for him to have mobility.  But he at least needs a way to catch out enemies with a heavy slow or root or stun so he can actually close that gap and use his passive.  Yeah he has long range but without on hits and crits and without a way to close the distance that range counts for very little.  Gap closers dont actually need to be dashes or movement speed boosts.  They can be cc too.  ADCs are supposed to skirt fights and stay at range.  So if you want him to ignore that paradigm you have to do two things  Give good incentive to do so and  Give means to do so.  Look at graves.  He has means quickdraw to gap close and passive and smokescreen to survive the increased damage threat and reason Buckshot deals more damage with more bullets hit R is easier to hit from close range.  Ahab has reason his two passives and no means.And yeah Ahab being an AA bot is a bad thing because thats really boring to play.  It would be like sivir with her only active spell being Ricochet.  Or Jinx with her only spell being Switcheroo.  Or Kog with his only spell being his range boost.  His ult is really interesting and provides good gameplay but as soon as it hits or misses his game play literally reverts back to what it was before hit as much as possible for as long as possible.  Theres no thought process of chaining spells using attack resets casting spells during aa cooldowns using defensive spells reactivelypredictively using different spells at different ranges or for different reasons.  Literally just a flow chart of Can I hit them? If yes hit them.  If no reposition and repeat.As far as W dissuading people from diving him his passive already does that.  W just amplifies his passive.  So youre using up a skill slot just to gate the power of his passive by skill ranks.  Thats why I think its a waste of a skill slot.  And graves isnt the inverse hes the same.  His damage threat is much higher at close range because of his buckshot.,LoLChampConcepts,ctjn82m,1,t5_2t7e7

Make a mage fighter tank marksman almost anything. Wanna make a champion that is kind and wants to help everyone? Make a support or tank. I have made a ghost that is a support a child from the forest as a support a sea hunter as a support an appearance from another dimension as support and I or a friend of mine is gonna get a Shuriman Legend as a support. Just like mages the themes are endless. Plus I love working with hard spells CC and yes also Marks and ability chaining. I love supports.

Because of how low the heal is increased per level and the greatness of the mana cost this will be his most important spell but people wont even level it up because it offers so much for so little at rank .With that build a level  W can heal for  per second at the cost of barely  of his maximum mana  before factoring in Runes or any masteries besides Windspeakers Blessing.

6669665,0,t3_43lbhl,Passive a lot of raw bonuses that do not really allow for interaction. the bonus damage on autos is also really signifcant and apart from the scaling exactly the same as Corkis passive. i would say this passive is OP but im not sure. im definitely not a fan of it though because it gives you a lot of free stuff without any effort at all.Q quite similar to Caitlyns trap but its a bit more interactive. it is much stronger though as it affects champions around it and has an ad scaling. id say that more than makes up for the fact that it potentially only slows in most cases. skill in itself seems okay just not the most creative one.W i cant figure out in what direction the arrows fly. it is like TFs wild cardsashe Volley? the idea of gaining bonus range is pretty cool though and the percentage health damage fits well with the theme of a beast hunter.E Im not a fan of targeted stuns especially this one since you can combine it very easily with your Q with little counterplay. The skill also heals and im not sure why he would need that. A long time ago in I believe the beta version but i could be wrong on when this was Ezreal used to have a heal as well. They eventually removed it because it turned out to be near impossible to balance and it just didnt make sense on a marksman. so my question here is how do you justify Galladan having a healing skill? Gameplaywise he doesnt need it imo and thematically it also doesnt make sense to me. and the stun is just too good because its so easy to apply.R thematically this ability fits well but i dont think its a good one. this is the third ability in his kit passive and w that gives you bonus damage. the movement speed is okay i guess it allows you to dodge stuff but once the target is out of range the movement speed disappears as well. the bonus on kill works well thematically but gameplaywise is meh.Overall reasonably balanced kit a bit OP i would say but nothing seems to be majorly wrong. the bonus damage is all over the place so i would definitely change that. some skills show a lot of resemblence with existing skills which is a pity. the theme is very well done so  on that part. this champion definitely shows potential so well done!,LoLChampConcepts,d0978er,1,t5_2t7e7
