5425580,0,t3_3pcmwx,Just to give some insight on where im at with my ideas ill do minor details per each mode or feature.I would like to reserve the rights for the Winter Classic and the Olympics which both would be added in CoachGMOwner mode which i call Club Mode. Game modes as of now are Play Now Club Career and OnlinePlay now is self explanatoryClub mode youd pick coach GM owner or full spectrum which is all three. Picking one two or all  youd play the mode only doing the task thay each job presents.A few  Features or things id like to implement. No preset lines Players with the st nd rd th MNR CHK Forward or anything like that through FA and contracts you would enter an actual negotiation discussing line assignment money and contract length with each playerthis how the NHL operates with contract negotiations this system allows you to have full control of your lines even through simming. Youd assign your lines and who the AC would call up to replace players if theyre hurt as opposwd to the AC in EA messsing lines up when you give them controlNo  overall rd liners being put above  nd liners. Players would assign scouts through detail such as picking height weight shooting hand position role. There would be more correlation from the staff..such as Coaching staff gives sticky note updatw throughout the season on how each player is doing to better gauge who deserves what spot or leadership responibilities. Player Development for the AHL and individual or team practice for the NHL. Player development would work like picking one of how many stat catagories Shooting Skating Senses etc etc and developing those. Individual or team practice is around the same but helps build chemistry and further brings out the best of your major league players. Career mode is create a player... height weight shooting hand ..and through playing the game gives you a player type based on how you play. There would be no penalty for simming..the game would sim based off the current stats for your player. Interviews..contract negotiations. Players would not be drafted by teams that did not need their position. Players would not jump line rank above higher cornerstone players regardless of how good they are. No center would replace Toews or crosby and no LW would take Ovechkins spot etc etc..No trade claus andplayers would be able to ask for a trade to a certain team. Express concerns or happiness with your coach or GM. Online...Ive never liked EAs online mode..ive always felt it was just a money pit. Designed to make players spend money on a game of chance ..you may spend a  bucks and never get a outstanding player..so for my online ive thought about having the OFHL..Online Fantasy Hockey League..which is about the same as EAs HUT..Opposed to picking cards players would start off with a certain amount of PointsEA has pucks as their ingame currency Which they would go through Free Agency and buy AHL or NHL players with the Points they have. You would have a salary cap to sign players and each player would last for a certain amount of games or seasons if seasons were the option a season may be  games or something alog those lines and after their contract expired they would not be able to be resigned for a certain amount of time. In the OFHL players would play through tournaments or take their OFHL team through a season and earn points by completing seasons or tournaments. Other game modes would include a Scratch Mode where players assumed the role of GM for one season starting from scratch..meaning  players would choose a team then enter FA and have a bidding war prolly then sim the season and whoever wims the cup gets X amount of points and so forth and so on down the ladder for placing in the playoffs. There would also be pick up games or other game modes involving CaPs. For a home menu id have a theatre that played a highlight reel of the most recent season for each Gamers favorite team or a camera roll of the most recent roster..or through playing the game players can cut and save bits of Instant Replay and fashion their own highlight reel. The theatre woild feature a top and bottom border that showcased that teams banners current players and players throught that clubs history. An addition to the theatre would be League News..any article or interview for players favorite team would be uploaded and available on the Home screen..players could pick League News as a theatre options as well. Off to the left of the screen would be a pedestal..on this pedestal the players CaPs would cycle..listing all accolades and accomplishments of the CaP. Across the bottom of the Theatre and CaP pedestal the game options would be listed. Play Now Game ModesCareer Club Season etc etc and Online. The dilema im having is how to make money through the years and keep the fans happy.. in order for any game to thrive it has to pay for itself..especially sport games. EA releases a new game every year that normally is the same game as the previous. I would like to spend  years developing a good startting point and then every year release a or multiple addon or expansion pack with content. I could charge per pack or do a yearly charge to access the servers that would include all content ..i would prolly leave this up to a fan vote..Please give me some feedback on your thoughts about this and if it would be something youd help become a reality. Im not a developer nor do i have millions to imvest or this ball would already be rollin.,NHL16,cw56a5o,1,t5_2xt65

6203239,0,t3_4025xr,A huge mistake I was making was the way I moved the joystick when the ref dropped the puck.
