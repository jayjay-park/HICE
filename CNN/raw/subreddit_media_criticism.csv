9517542,0,t1_d9m6j84,Ok but I will give you an outsiders perspective. I remember when the world watched in what can best be described as disappointment when the US went into the Iraq war. The loud chorus of support from Americans online and in the Media. A visceral disgust and disappointment in a uniquely american self defeating arrogance  is the best way to describe it. IT was fuelled by paper thin arguments that held no sway unless you were inside the tornado of american nationalism. The same american craziness is feeding trump phenomenon. A manic irrational groupthink that conveniently shifts the definitions of words like corruption. And it will lead to nothing good. Australia does not want Trump. Its the same american dumbness that lost the moral leadership that has given them soft power for decades and the Obama clawed back. If you get Trump you will lose the soft power benefit of the doubt and global trade deals will circumvent you especially if Trump tries his Braggadocious brinkmanship. IT wont purge corruption because Trump will be in fact institutionalising the the bias he prefers. Look at Australias Tony Abbott who rode in on a wave of populist angst over illegal immigrants against a woman and then as soon as he was in power his approval dropped to nothing and he was ousted within less than two years,media_criticism,d9m8myz,1,t5_3a6w2

10716088,0,t1_ddl88w2,You are correct the ICU wasnt necessarily elected however they did have support from the majority of Somalis due to the corruption within the UN led Transitional Federal Government despite the majority of Somali Muslims practicing Sufism rather than Wahabism. Their main support for the ICU came from the CIA openly funding ARPCT warlords. Somalis leaned towards the ICU as a way to rid the country of foreign influence and warlord rule. And I understand what you mean by not shoving our dicks in peoples faces but the fact is none of that matters. Tell a Somali civilian that his death is okay because we did it to knock out ICU which ended up being somewhat of a failure because the Ecudorian army couldnt maintain control after December . I doubt they give a shit if our involvement was about a petty landgrab or not. War crimes are war crimes. I do see what you mean but its a distinction without a difference imo.Our government officials do their best to control media as well. It may not be as overt but with individuals like David Brock of Media Matters partnering with Facebook to combat what they deem fake news and with past CIA operations like Mockingbird it isnt hard to see that our government definitely plays a role in controlling and shaping our news media. I guess the best way to explain how I see this specific topic is that Russia and Putin specifically are more obvious with their press intimidation while our government chooses to be more covert in how they deal with media manipulation.Take the Iraq War news coverage in which the Pentagon used retired officers as political analysts to shill for the adminstration on TV. Do journalists in our country fear for their lives? Id agree that for the most part they dont. Except when they cover whistleblower stories like Snowden. Or the Fox News and AP reporters who were targeted by Obamas DOJ in order to identify their sources. Our government definitely does shady shit to journalists do I think its directly compatible with the threatening atmosphere Russian journalists feel? Probably not. But theres a lot that goes on behind the scenes that we dont know about so honestly I couldnt say for sure.

10900390,0,t1_de46gpt,Maddow is a favorite target of media criticism in general because shes a frequent user of hatebaiting tactics her flavoring of the TrumpRussia position mentioned here is particularly McCarthyistic. In addition she opened herself up to significant criticism by becoming a key purveyor of the notion that the Pepe the frog meme was a symbol of hatred. She even went so far as to substantiate her opinion by presenting Naziesque images of Pepe when in fact appending the word Nazi to any Google Images search for common cartoon characters like Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse would reveal numerous such examples. This type of cherry picking is hateful and disingenuous.She also frequently employs two common logical fallacies appeal to emotion and appeal to authority. Its very difficult for her to communicate her opinion without drawing on an emotive appeal and making repeated reference to research or intellectual authority without actually presenting that research in an academically honest light.,media_criticism,de4aqcj,27,t5_3a6w2
