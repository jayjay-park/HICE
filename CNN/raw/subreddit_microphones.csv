352095,0,t3_1y306y,I had the exact same experience with the Blue Yeti. What you want is a supercardioid dynamic microphone. Since you probably want USB the Audio Technica ATRUSBATUSB are the obvious choice. If youre in Europe like me where its impossible to get these things the Samson QU was a good alternative.Make sure to get a stand the pickup pattern on these is pretty tight so you want them very close to you.,microphones,cfh9g4g,1,t5_2rsv7

3592835,0,t3_31htdm,Is the color an absolute? If not I would bump up your price range a bit and get this mic. Also this boom stand is cheaper and if while shock mounts are nice they arent needed immediately. If you save some more money this shock mount is greator so my friends have told me. I havent gotten it yet. Waiting for the next paycheck. ,microphones,cq1t6hj,1,t5_2rsv7
3608098,0,t1_cq1t6hj,That seems like a very good microphone. Thanks. However if my budget went up to  what would you think of the AT for my purposes? I really love the look color and sound quality. Edit On a side note would I need a sound mixer? I have an astro mixamp if thats the same thing? ,microphones,cq3jsah,1,t5_2rsv7

3775879,0,t1_cqmo02b,They work better in that situation on a table usually no more than  people per mic... but without knowing more about the room and the system it will be feeding I couldnt really tell you. The good news is that in a conference setting they will not need to be fed into the local room so feedback will not be an issue.,microphones,cqmof6w,2,t5_2rsv7
3777489,0,t1_cqmosvn,I suggest this over the snowball. Roughly the same price but much better. Unless you absolutely need a color theme. ,microphones,cqmv0y6,1,t5_2rsv7

4669216,0,t3_3etmf5,Ive owned several cloned mics. Ive also used their respective originals.  I had a few different Peluso mics.  The  and the P.  They both sounded great and were in the general direction of what the original offered.  They were both great mics I miss the  especially.  I also used various mics from Beez Neez their U clones were a little nicer than the Peluso in my opinion but not  nicer.  If your interested in a U clone Id avoid ebay and go with a reputable brand like Advanced Audio  The ebay link actually looks kinda of like their mic...and its more expensive than AA ! ,microphones,ctj3vsp,2,t5_2rsv7
5027214,0,t3_3jrg88,Dont get the Blue Snowball. Its awful especially for the price. One of the best USB microphones that you can get for your money is the Samson CU Pro  Its a great microphone and it fixes a lot of the problems with the non pro version. The sound quality is decent and will definitely not get you criticized for using it. I am from the UK so I dont know if Best Buy stocks it but I cant stress enough not to just go with the Snowball out of convenience. The CU really is worth the wait if you have to.,microphones,curyy58,1,t5_2rsv7

5570236,0,t1_cwesz7k,Turns out mic was faulty. Went to Best Buy and bought another Yeti plugged it in. Works like a charm. Returned the other one. Never shopping eBay again...Thanks for the input tho much appreciated.,microphones,cwnjev6,1,t5_2rsv7
6183668,0,t1_cysgzr0,Can you please elaborate? Is there any specific audio interface or mixer i should look into? Sorry I know a lot about computers but when it comes to audio its a whole different story.,microphones,cysioyl,1,t5_2rsv7
6800164,0,t3_48vukw,Where do you have the Yeti placed? One way to increase bass in your voice is to get real close to the microphone to induce proximity effect although that has its own drawbacks as well.An example of streamers youre talking about would be helpful.gtmonotoneThats on you to fix. More bass doesnt make you less monotone.One unfortunate thing about the yeti is judging purely off of the frequency response chart its not exactly a bass friendly mic lol. I dont have one so I cant say for sure but eh.,microphones,d0n3azy,1,t5_2rsv7
7600058,0,t3_4jdsan,I wouldnt worry yourself too much about the matched pair thing. Just fix the one you have or replace it if necessary with same make and model ... Stock stuff should be close enough for typical SDC use. That being said if youre upgrading there are some seriously good SDCs out there. ,microphones,d3636ym,3,t5_2rsv7
7898169,0,t1_d43ee4n,Yeah I have some good headphones so I think I might as well go for the new soundcard. Even if the mics quality isnt improved a sound upgrade would be great. Thanks for the help,microphones,d43ttdz,1,t5_2rsv7

10450598,0,t3_5olft2,Hello guys. Im one of those lets player twats and I currently have a blue yeti on a shock mount with a rde arm stand thingie. Problem is the damn thing picks up my mechanical keyboard and mouse clicks like theres no tomorrow. Placement doesnt seem to matter nor does proximity to my face. Edit Im also hoping to be able to buy some open back headphones and not have the mic pick up the sound from those.Im looking for an alternative in the same price range that wont do this. ,microphones,dcso97f,1,t5_2rsv7
10511846,0,t3_5qirjq,Its funny how the SM went from being a good snare mic to the best fucking microphone for anything you would ever want to record.,microphones,dczmo9p,4,t5_2rsv7
10629521,0,t3_5qirjq,Snowball is a decent mic it just needs to be much closer to you turn down the gain and get a spring arm   neewer microphone boom arm to put it close enough to pick up more of your voice than the reflections in the room a few inchesI. have some good condensers and my room is terrible something as simple as a thick blanket behind you and a few pillows on the wall facing you behind your computer will cut reflections significantly. placement is key with condenser mics. and for vocals a pop filter  on amazon will cut down your plosives so you dont have to clean up as much from your recordings. finally if you did go the shure handheld route the SM is what youd want its the same as the sm but with a built in pop filter. ,microphones,ddccrhk,2,t5_2rsv7
