1811282,0,t3_2f90u1,All around pretty usual. For recent times at least. Parents are going through a pretty nasty divorce so I have to play emotional support for my mom. It sucks but it is good in a way because it is definitely making us closer. Dad was kicked out but I am trying to stay close to both of them even though it can be hard sometimes. He taught me how to drive a manual on Sunday so that was fun.My two best friends a couple are on the verge of breaking up and I think the girl Laurel is taking a liking to me. Puts me in a tough place because Ive been friends with her boyfriend Luke for more than four years. Ive just been trying to be a neutral party in all of it though as it is a rule of mine not to get involved in other peoples relationships. I dont know... Hes been pretty closed in recently and doesnt want to hang out with me so I think he blames me for their relationship problems in a way? Whatever though he hasnt been the best friend recently that he has been in the past despite me trying my damned hardest to be his. If they break up I feel like Im gonna lose a friend. Then Id be down to three close friends.But otherwise things are pretty good. School is going well. I recently changed my major after discovering my passion for biochemistry so Im really excited about that. Other than the drama I am pretty happy with my life at the moment. Jobless and poor but happy.Sorry for the rant. Just needed to get this shit off my chest.,WhatsIn6Ward,ck7fot6,3,t5_2wt9f
2931195,0,t1_co18jln,Thats a good point. But what about when we branch out across the galaxy? Sure we could come up with different names for every star but dont we use numerical denominations for some of them? I guess we would name them like we did ours though.Actually I guess it makes sense to go Big gt small. After all the way we currently write addresses is small gt big.,WhatsIn6Ward,co1ae9o,1,t5_2wt9f
