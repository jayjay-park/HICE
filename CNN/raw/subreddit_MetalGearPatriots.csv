5291596,0,t3_3nh9sl,Protect that nukes with your life. Make sure youre supporting as many people as possible so theyll support you back. If someone invades Fulton that nukes out first thing dont worry itll go straight back to your base no problem and the enemy cant get them anymore. ,MetalGearPatriots,cvo2abo,3,t5_39yvb

5914969,0,t1_cxuz1br,I didnt know it was not a supported tactic. It surprised the Hell out of me when I heard this was going on and I do apologize for freaking out. Ill spread the word over at NBGO and see if I can keep them out of your guys hair. You guys who are playing fairly do deserve a HUGE amount of recognition. Weve got people on NBGO taking out  nukes a day and the numbers are hardly dropping at all. Id honestly be interested in a write up from one of you guys preferably you or another mod after all this is over. Im very curious as to how often the average Patriot produces a nuke and how much time GMP resources MBcoins etc.. goes into it all. This is an extremely unique type of multiplayer experience and I think a lot of people would be interested in how it all went down once its over.But yeah sorry brother. Carry on ,MetalGearPatriots,cxuzg7m,1,t5_39yvb
