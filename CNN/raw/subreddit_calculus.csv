In this case you know fx is defined for ab but are not given any information on if the function is defined outside it. You know that the limit as x gt a from the right exists because fx is defined for all x greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b. The limit on the left side does not exist because fx is not defined to the left of a xlta. Therefore the limit does not exist because lim x gta ! lim xgta,calculus,cunonn2,3,t5_2qxm5

Now if you take the derivative of the Vt you get the acceleration for the same projectile in respect to time At.

9954889,0,t3_5i33ce,So the idea behind the Riemann Sum is that you take a curve and draw rectangles under the curve from the initial point to the terminal point. So say we have a curve that goes from  to . Now we draw  rectangles each of width  from the y axis up to the curve for the purposes of this example the curve is only in the first quadrant. If we take the area of these  rectangles under the curve it approximates just that the area under the curve. The only problem with having such wide rectangles is that there is a bit of them that goes either too far above or under the curve throwing the true area off. Now if we shrink the width of the rectangles the less space above or below the curve our rectangles will be. So now rather than our rectangles be of width  we make the width as small as possible which will make our approximation even closer. This is where Xinfinity comes in. You make the width of the rectangles infinitely small and sum up their areas under the curve. This way the approximate area under the curve is as close as it can get.
