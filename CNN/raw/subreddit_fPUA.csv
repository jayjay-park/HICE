220587,0,t3_1wmoht,Can be very hard indeed! Make sure to get your own drinks go to the bathroom by yourself find some weird excuse to check the weather outside etc. Make yourself physically approachable by not being in your friends circle all the time. Important is to stress that approachability by radiating happiness openness and being single. How? Make and keep eye contact smile a lot dance a few steps and have fun. ,fPUA,cf3kjqc,3,t5_2skdi
439237,0,t3_1z3j9s,Not that I am an expert because I am a more reserved person but if I where you I would dress so I felt sexy not sluty and make small talk with some guys that you have seen around. Just by doing this the guys you talk to will start to see that your easy to talk to and that your confident about yourself. I think most people look at self sufficient independent and confident people as a more appealing SO or friend. So just begin with being comfortable in your our skin and make a point to talk to people! Best of luck! ,fPUA,cfqainw,1,t5_2skdi
478283,0,t1_cfum4ac,It is basically like a yes or no app that shows you pictures of a person. If the two of you hit yes you can talk to each other. Haha. It is really big on university campuses right now. Anyway. I was never sure if lists and things like that were useful. I dont want to stick to too much of a list and I do have a general idea of what I want but there are certain things I am willing to compromise on. Thank you for your advice  ,fPUA,cfumtpe,1,t5_2skdi
481291,0,t1_cfup4qv,Thanks so much  I feel like in the past while Ive done a lot of reflection on where I want to be in my life and what I like so the logical step for that is for me to decide what I want in a partner and like you said that will change with experiences! I think I just really had to talk this out with somebody because the constant disappointments are rough. So thank you so much for offering quality advice  ,fPUA,cfuz582,1,t5_2skdi
559608,0,t1_cg3t585,Note when Im talking about Europe everything is of course a huge generalization since there are so many different countries. What I say applies mostly to north  middle. In which country are you going to?Because we dont really do the whole complimenting thing we also are somewhat confused and dont know how to react to compliments. The most typical way to reply is to downplay it. For example I went out with my hubbys lover last night and she said Ooh I like your makeup I normally never wear make up not even in parties so this was clearly a surprising thing and thats why she could comment it in the first place  nobody would compliment the makeup of a person who normally wears makeup. I said Gee thanks but you know I really cannot do make up this is just a pathetic attempt at makeup. Something like that is very typical. We wouldnt say anything obviously untrue No no youre much better piano player than I am but we will downplay it the best we can.So if youre going to Europe there are two things in the conversation culture you probably also want to take into account.  People generally mean what they say and expect you to mean what you say too. We dont say things just for the sake of saying things. Like if you say we should hang out some time that really means you want to hang out. And if you say Oh thats really interesting that means you really find it interesting and want to hear more.  The conversations are calmer and more organized. We also bounce to new topics but we just somehow... bounce... slower. Also the pause signalling now its your turn to speak is much much longer. So when I talk with Americans I often feel that they dont let me speak at all they just keep babbling away  because I would actually need them to shut up to start speaking myself. I dont really have the need to speak so if they happily talk away without ever shutting up I wont put much effort into interrupting them. Also I find it rude to bounce all the time to new topics before giving other people an opportunity to say something about the topic if they have something to say. But this is just a difference in culture ofc I know theyre not really rude its just my perception.I hope this helps. ,fPUA,cg3vu3w,3,t5_2skdi

2227191,0,t1_clmx63x,Maybe a group activity?  You mentioned a mutual hobby can you plan an event soon?  Anything to get you two in a relaxed  fun environment.When you see him in passing or at your club meet  just chat with him.  Keep flirting and getting to know him.  Eventually youll get talking about a hobby or something youre both into.  Then suggest that you do it together.  I.e. lets go rock climbing! When you go make sure its just you two.  Itll feel more like a date  and hes less likely to view you as just a friend.  ,fPUA,clmxgyk,1,t5_2skdi

2722570,0,t3_2r8nl2,gtThat kiss led exactly no where for reason I am not sure of.The reason is because you just grabbed him out of nowhere and kissed him immediately. No time to build up any attraction. What did you do after? Not that its going to come up again for a while but a good way to go from there would be to make a joke about it Well now that weve kissed I guess I better get to know you. I hope youre not a total asshole.gtWe just strolled back in and I put on a face but I still felt like everyone was judging me negatively.Probably not for the makeout it was New Years after all thats to be expected but because Next I continued flirting up everyone I ran into. Girls gays guys straight guys people I had known for years people I just met. Lots of touching hugs close proximity pecks on cheeks etc.I bet you were coming across as very desperate. But you live and learn.gtgoddanggit I missed it when my friends went on a Taco run. I wanted some Tacos.Oh. You must be a youngin. Probably around college age? At that point people think Im drunk I need food. In your lates and s it starts to become OP is drunk we need to get her food.gtI got what I wanted at the end of the night and had a good time.And thats all that matters.

2770291,0,t1_cnixrtv,Appreciated. Its not clear from this thread but I dont view this stuff from a sole perspective. I was going for a more Robert Greene than a John Gottman angle with this thread but dont discredit the merits of both.

5394220,0,t3_3ovpfu,Well your probably not attractive enough. Sounds harsh but your likely a . Your probably not   because guys actually approach you. And most s are actually nice because they get approached less often  can be selective because they are approached by more attractive men more often than men who think she is out of their league. So there is a solid chance that you are a . s dont get their attention typically from the most attractive males in the pickup sense. They seem more achievable so they are approached . More often and . By a wider range of guys. In order to feel like they have some power over those who they attract s often develop a bitch complex and reject all guys in their tier to feel like they have some control  choice.  Thats why every  I have known is a down right sweet heart and almost every single  I know is a cunt. Try lowering your bitch shields and going to the gym. PS not being a dick well yeah but being an honest dick. PPS just as I am looking for a Victoria secret model who loves to cook and blow me while I play video games I know I reasonably wont get one so instead of looking for a male model who rides a motor bike and has k in the bank and goes on adventure vacations every six months look a little more realistically. ,fPUA,cw1670w,14,t5_2skdi

6796647,0,t1_d0moluw,I dont know what the basis would be for him thinking Im not very social since literally every time he sees me Im at the venue with a group of friends and also socializing with others ... edit regarding the time passes part less than  hours had passed. I never said I was inexperienced and spark  is just the word I used to sum up the initial excitement I have felt when first getting to know some other men even recently but not him.  chemistry connection attraction whatever. anyway I appreciate the thought youve put into your advice but it also tells me I didnt convey things very well. to read this sounds like I liked him but was too flakey so now  hes no longer interested and Im disappointed. the point of update is see title is Im not interested. ,fPUA,d0movuk,2,t5_2skdi

10223881,0,t3_5lt2rt,Actions speak louder then words.   If you ask him how he is or how he thinks the relationship is he will most likely lie to just keep the status quo.So talk to him about what you feel and what you think is going on and what kind of contact you would like to have with him when you are both busy.But honestly he seems not interested anymore and after just  months it might be best to just let this run its course.You are young and can surely find someone else.Be greatful this isnt  years into the relationship.,fPUA,dc2xn3s,1,t5_2skdi
