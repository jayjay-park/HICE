It also seems like there are more than just one method to achieve this.What is the best games on Vita is highly subjective so those who are able to decrypt games might have a different opinion on that. Filesize on the other hand seems to be a factor at least for FreeKs method since it takes a lot of time to decrypt.,VitaPiracy,d7085w2,5,t5_3fxlj

8960929,0,t3_530s1n,You can wait or just download the games thatve been tested already by people. Just look for comments about people playing it already.All of the games that Ive been playing have been stable and Im almost  hours into Odin Sphere Leifthrasir US now DJust look on places like here use the search thing on the right of this subreddit and get links etc. You can get the updates and DLC a lot of times this way too for popular games.Dont download anything unless its been tested if you dont want to be wasting your time. Always read comments before downloading you cant always trust uploaders because sometimes theyll just upload things and just say its been tested.   torrents filtered results for Vita mostly animetype or animerelated games or just games only from Japan some of the games here use Maidump and not Vitamin so be careful of that before you download.If youre scared of playing with your PSN you can use account switcher to keep your data on your card but use a different account and then just switch back and forth when you want to without riskIf the version of Vitamin isnt explicitly stated good uploaders will put it in their titles somewhere then you can use this to find outUpgrade your Vitashell to at least . you should be prompted for an update if you have a lower version when you start molecular shell with this version you can install updates for games that are vpk just by clicking on them in the same way you install games its really nice If you dont have enough space to store games on your card you can also use something like vitaorganizer which will allow you to install games from your PC without needing double the space on your Vita theres lots of these types of applications but Ive been using vitaorganizer a lot and it works great for me  and the direct download link can be found here you need to have Java to be able to run it Its pretty simple to use just open it up and then point it to the folder on your PC with your vpk files in start the FTP server on your Vita by pressing the Select button in molecularshell dont close the window because thatll close the FTP server down and then type in the IP address that it gives you into vitaorganizer. Click the Connect PSVita button and itll connect and display your current games and stuff may take a little while then rightclick on the game you want to send to your Vita click Send Full App to PS Vita in just one step and itll send it. After that just open up the bubble as normal for the game.Might take a little while depending on your connection and itll display how much its done of it but first itll compile things first before sending it. You can check your network connection yourself in Windows by clicking on Accessories gt System Tools gt Resource Monitor and then click on the Network tab to see how fast its sending data. Or you can just use a third party network monitor to check your speeds.Hope that helps.,VitaPiracy,d7oyw7z,3,t5_3fxlj
8962553,0,t1_d7p0xjp,Yep.wartunerguyed you always need to do the exploit again whenever you restart your Vita. Just click on molecular shell youll see an orange button that says Install next to the Start button. Click on that and itll do it for you without you having to type anything in your browser its much faster. After that just use your Vita as normal.If you cant go online to do the exploit then get the offline installer just google it.,VitaPiracy,d7p5wvm,1,t5_3fxlj

9227783,0,t1_d8lhgdf,It is the equivalent of formatting the HDD of your computer. The only option to restore your OS is to use a bootable install diskUSB. Vita doesnt have a way to boot an external device nor would it allow an external device to install to it. As far as we know anyway.

Its creating more apps and tweaks for a handheld that we all have besides our cell phones.  No scene is ever built FOR piracy they always simply end up that way.  But this time around homebrew and custom apps are happening just as much as piracy.  So to answer your dense question...no. ,VitaPiracy,d8v6lrt,13,t5_3fxlj

10652859,0,t3_5sfz06,Is it possible that as I already installed these vpks on  gb card and now I inserted a  gb card some files remained in the file system and this way the vpk cant be installed one more time?Since I didnt format the VITA I only replaced the  GB card which already had MAI and VitaShell to a  GB which is still empty. Can this cause the problem? Do I need to format the VITA?,VitaPiracy,dderdz6,1,t5_3fxlj

10889449,0,t1_de31bgd,Man this has been touch so many times before and the answer is always the same one. Axiom Verge is a ported game and some files are unable to be decrypteddumped by the current tools. I was one of the unlucky ones I ended buying the game after knowing the story behind games creator. You should have a look at it and buy the game from the PSN its worthy every penny also the money is for a good cause. I ended crying when knew the specialty of this game.

11218272,0,t3_6050m3,Yeah more or less. Reading times seems to be slower in some games and faster in others. But the writing times seems to be way slower in all games so there is some stuttering here and there when the game is writing savegames and other info.Could be the USB im using a Datatraveler G . exFAT with good reading and writing speeds ... for big archives but no single USB is good at writing small files.Maybe those insanely fast Sandisk SDHCS could archive better performance through SD USB adapters.I have done a quick comparison with few games.,VitaPiracy,df3kslv,3,t5_3fxlj
