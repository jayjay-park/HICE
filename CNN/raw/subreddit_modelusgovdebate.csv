4535916,0,t1_ct2cx3m,Most socialists I have talked to do not consider modern China to be socialist and instead view it as state capitalist or a deformed workers state. The common view among Marxists such as myself is that China became revisionist after Mao died and Deng Xiaoping introduced many capitaliststyle free market reforms and we do not support the modern Chinese state or uphold it as socialist whatsoever.,modelusgovdebate,ct2du75,7,t5_37tyc
4537137,0,t1_ct2ghec,Its much easier to debate and write legislation than to make an indepth and informed legal opinion. The history of the Supreme Court is a long one and researching some of the more obscure decisions is very time consuming. Im not very educated on legal matters and there are other people in this sub who have gone or are going to law school. On the other hand I spend a majority of my free time learning about politics reading about current and past events and developing my opinions. Legislative involvement will be much easier than being a Supreme Court Justice. ,modelusgovdebate,ct2jcpn,2,t5_37tyc
4537496,0,t1_ct2k8eh,Would you classify redistribution of wealth as Liberty? This seems like a hinge point. Liberty would be allowing all to keep what they earn no matter how much or how little. You I would assume as a socialist correct me if I am wrong believe not only that government should have the power to determine where the fruits of an individuals labor go but that you can allocate it better than than he or she. That sir is not Liberty. That is tyranny and arrogance.,modelusgovdebate,ct2kz3j,1,t5_37tyc
4546189,0,t1_ct2ortn,While I dont think we should soften requirements to become citizens I do believe that its in everyones interests to promote illegal immigrants a path to becoming legal residents. Not only will this allow those people to contribute to this countries diversity and become a part of our culture without the constant threat of deportation it would also turn them into taxpaying citizens which is the primary reason that the opposition to illegal immigration cites. ,modelusgovdebate,ct3o8k9,1,t5_37tyc

4555014,0,t1_ct2co5d,Great question uben.GOP It is difficult to find common ground between the ALP and the GOP on most issues. Personally speaking one of the topics that Im passionate about yet few parties have been addressing is the skyrocketing rate of obesity in our nation and diseases related to it. I havent proposed any legislation on it yet but theres a possibility that it may contain some centrist policies that I would be happy to have GOP support in.Democrats I think the ALP aligns very much with the Democratic Party on many social issues including gay rights freedom to choose and healthcare.Distributists Even though our policies on social issues are contrary to the Distributists I know that they care very much about the family. So do I and the ALP and I hope to find common ground with them in good legislation to help American families such as parental leave and healthcare.GLP The GLP and the ALP agree a lot on both economic and social issues and I see a lot of potential for our parties to both get a lot of work done together.Silver Legion Nothing probably,modelusgovdebate,ct4s3ku,1,t5_37tyc
4555626,0,t1_ct4ueck,minimum wage increases artificially increase inflation which Decreases the value of money in the end after a few months the people at minimum wage before are in the same place while ever one who was between the old and the new minimum wage are now at minimum wage and those have experienced a decrease in buying power.

He really is fantastic and Id suggest that all of our fellow citizens pick up his books. My campaign is in no way financed by KilcullenIm a Democrat for several reasons  I believe strongly in fighting for the rights of women racial minorities and GSM I advocate for govt intervention in the economy when its needed for consumer and environmental protection economic success and internal infrastructure redevelopment and because they remain a big tent party for liberals. I differ from many of my colleagues in terms of trade and foreign policy but by no means all of them. For a bit more information Im a member of both the New Democrat blue dog Caucus and the ChristianLeft Caucus. This is all a great example of a place where I can advocate strongly for my ideals while creating multipartisan bonds thanks to my unique ideological positioning within my party.,modelusgovdebate,cvndg8c,2,t5_37tyc

I believe in a fair democratic and anti establishment voice for the people of North East State. I believe in a  continuing the great progress our State has made while at the same time being practical in terms of economics and funding. I hope to have a fully functioning budget committee and I will ensure my cabinet will be full of active individuals. As Governor I plan on offering incentives for new Small Businesses to get their starts here in the North East State. I also plan on helping subsidise newer businesses opening in Atlantic City to help rebuild the economy of the shoreline. I will also fight for a single payer healthcare system for the entirety of the North East State. ,modelusgovdebate,czhvk4g,1,t5_37tyc
