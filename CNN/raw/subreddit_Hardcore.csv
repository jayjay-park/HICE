8279240,0,t1_d5cfsee,Very common. Its especially weird to me when Ive gone out of state because the way people act is completely different and Ive seen a lot of shit that you just dont get away with in Virginia. Ive lived here my whole life and its where I started in hardcore and I learned about how important respect is and things that you just dont do at shows. Which to me is what makes sense. Being yourself not being an asshole dont try to be a tough guy and the list goes on. Its what I know hardcore to be and as long as you just do you and dont be a dickhead you make the best fucking friends you could ever ask for and a place you can call home. I see none of that when I go out of state I may still have fun but its not even close to what I experience here. I could go on and on about it but you already know what Im talking about and honestly trying to explain Virginia to people who arent from here is complicated. ,Hardcore,d5cgpl2,1,t5_2qilj

Hatebreeds Satisfaction Is The Death of Desire is another classic you should definitely listen to. If youre looking for more hardcore Im big into Dead End Path and Blind Justice. Based on the bands you listed in the original comment Id also highly recommend you look into Kublai Khan more metalcore than hardcore but  great band nonetheless.
