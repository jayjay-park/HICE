1356201,0,t3_29g6sa,If youre into DH head to Camp Fortune. Otherwise your options are technical single track at South March Highlands in Kanata join  or mainly XC options as listed below.   Almonte Riverside Trail. Runs from Almonte just west of Ottawa to the Mill of Kintail. Outandback km of single track oneway with some fast sections and technical sections to keep things interesting. Signage is poor were working on that this summer but the trail is easy to follow. Google the map.  Stoney Swamp is also pretty fast and you can pull off a km loop through all the trails. Good for getting in XC miles. Unfortunately one of the more interesting single track sections was destroyed by fire a few years ago when they had to put in fire roads.  Further afield is Forest Lea up near Pembroke. Lots of tight single track well worth the drive.  Gatineau Park has trails of course but a lot of the good stuff is off limits to riders or has been improved by the NCC to make it drivable by stroller. Limerick Forest south of Ottawa is full of trails for mtb and dirt bikesATVs. The soil is mostly sandy so it drains fast after rain and can be a good option when everything else is muddy.  Even further afield and well worth the trip is Kingdom Trails in Vermont.  ams of flowy single track one of the IMBA top destinations in North America.  ,bikeinottawa,cimagu9,2,t5_2sreb

Hes only  atm.Scary thing is... if he did get lost on the way how would he tell us? Rely on the kindness of strangers? I might consider buying him a cellphone... OK. I have a tendency to rabbit hole. So thanks and mines . Lol,bikeinottawa,cpbx5nt,1,t5_2sreb

11379661,0,t1_dflolea,Sunday seems to be looking nice... Im getting my bike off the trainer and on to new tires tonight. If you can get to the aviation museum the shoulders on the road are pretty clean right now so it might be a good first run.,bikeinottawa,dflv61o,2,t5_2sreb
