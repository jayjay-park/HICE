I feel like I should be further along after going at it for  hours over  weeks but Im not.  I go as far as I can with one resource google the answer then move onto a different site and work from the beginning on that one. The benefit on this method is that you REALLY get a solid foundation of the basics from different teaching styles.  I would also recommend making your own flash cards I did mine in Google Sheets with a built in application to make flash cards.  Just be patient and try multiple sites.  I have done the followingMOOC gt best free one but kind of jumps ahead of the problems you work onCodemyUdacity EDX has ok stuff but overall decent videosGoGo paid  on Groupon so far I say its worth it as the videos are very goodHackerRank gt I would recommend this one only after doing some of the others as its a little fast but the videos are solid and the problems actually make you think,java_class,d5c7r5l,3,t5_3cljl
