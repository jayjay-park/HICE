323823,0,t1_cfdo8yc,Wasteland doesnt kill you. TNN does.Also yes we have  different decks but it doesnt matter much. The diversity is in name only. The whole format is contorted around TNN such that you play it you play a deck that plays past it comboflying beatdown or shuts down the combat step lands or you go home.PreTNN the format was about broad strategic approaches and you could just play almost whatever. The format had its bigwigs for sure but you didnt have to contrive decks specifically to beat one kind of threat that just took over any game it landed in.Now you do. And to add insult to injury while there is hate for TNN TNN doesnt require building your deck around anything. You just take whatever solid fair goodstuff shell you like and stuff it in. Chances are whatever cards hate TNN itself absolutely suck at combating the fair shell you slotted the Uninteraction Fish into. Its a pretty big difference from combo decks which barely manage to do anything if you hate on them.Also the games where TNN hits the table are miserable. Games without it are rich with interaction the moment TNN hits the field you race it or you lose. The whole rest of the game stops mattering. Id much rather have a top of x RUG x Shardless Elves x ANT or something. Because there would be actually interesting games being played. Thats the reason people complain about staleness. Because the experience sitting at the table shuffling up your deck is stale. That we have different names in the top is pretty meaningless when the games themselves suck.,MTGLegacy,cfec2db,1,t5_2x2p0

494939,0,t1_cfwijkq,My understanding of the LA legacy scene is that there is a good bit of combo running around. I Do like Ruric in the main in this instance. Adding a card like Mindbreak Trap to the board although there is a pretty big split in the elves camp about its usefulness might be a reasonable option but with  discard spells I can see it being unnecessary. If RUG makes a bit of a comeback after Atlanta I would advocate packing a Meekstone in the sideboard. Also a card like Pithing Needle serves a lot of functions in turning off Jitte Lavamancer and Top which can do a whole lot of damage if left unchecked. My suggestion for you would be to cut Forest and Ooze add the th nettle and heritage. Move Ooze to the board. Cut a decay from the board and add a Meekstone and a Needle. ,MTGLegacy,cfwj18m,1,t5_2x2p0

540866,0,t3_20bokz,Its difficult to judge which of these decks are better based on which deck put up  in a top  instead of . Fact of the matter is Delver decks in general are on a warpath. The ability to mainboard so much countermagic makes it easy to us to walk into an combo matchup with confidance. Rug Delver can fight the tempo  land disruption game better with slightly faster threats in Goyf and Mongoose stifling fetches and of course lightning bolt to compliment their faster game with reach. UWR on the other hand an duke it out with Jund and Shardless Bug and Stoneblade on the ground better than RUG can riding TrueNames with jitte to victory and universal removal in STP. I personally belive UWR has a better matchup across the board as it can recover more easily if it falls behind. It can just throw down mini progenitus and ride it to victory where RUG needs to make sure there isnt anything bigger than its Mongoose or something that can remove their Goyfs. Having said all of this Ive never actually piloted RUG myself only UWR. Both decks are very good and they do what they do well.

I was playing a list similar to the first one before either Feast and Famine or Batterskull were printed and Stoneforge was generally underappreciated in Legacy at the time.So historically Deadguy Ale morphed into more of a midrange deck before Stoneblade was really a thing. So I think its fine to refer to modern Dark ConfidantStoneforge decks as Deadguy Ale as their disruption package is still primarily HymnThoughseizeTidehollow ScullerLiliana versus the ForceSpell PierceCounterspell approach of Stoneblade lists.

1135635,0,t1_chvw6ie,Pretty much this.I often grind against a friend with his DnT with my Miracles deck. Depending on the Miracles version Ive tried the RiPHelm classic and MiracleForge the way to act is different of course.With RiPHelm an early Energy Field will keep his aggro to absolute nothing until you dig for RiP and can effectively turn your engine on or downright combo him out.MiracleForge is reduced to who can get Batterskull quicker in game. Of course with your counters you have a better chance.All versions of course use Terminus so a smart usage as the guy above me says will most likely earn you the match. Another thing that Miracles can use is Blood Moon to shut down their Wastelands and Ports I use at least one and its a fixed spot in any Miracles list and Modern list I can get it into though I dont really recommend it since often you lack cards to take out in the main.Also always have a StP ready for that pesky Oreskos.

Its been fascinating to watch Elves! find itself over the last year or two ... evolving from a weak combo deck that wanted to glimpse its whole deck then cast an Emrakul into the diverse green machine that it is today. All the while Glimpse of nature is playing less and less of a role demoted from primary wincon to green ancestral recall. Its great to have glimpse in case of emergency but the less Elves players rely on it the better off they seem.I think the Blood Moon version is the most solid innovation weve seen since of cradles though.

The rest of the list I already had.I bought the Lillianas when they were still cheap and my Wastelands came from buying way too many Tempest boosters back in the day.Ive replaced the sinkholes with Rain of Tears and Rancid Earth and yes a main deck Trinisphere to replace the Nether Void.So final list that I took to a recent Legacy Event was x Lilliana of the Veil   x Hymn to Tourach   x Inquisition of Kozilek   x Small Pox   x Dark Ritual   x Rain of Tears   x Rancid Earth   x Innocent Blood   x Pox   x Cursed Scroll   x Syphon Life   x Engineered Plague   x Trinisphere   x Crucible of Worlds   x Nether Spirit   x Swamp   x Wasteland   x Mishras Factory   x Verdant Catacombs   x Marsh Flats   x Bojuka Bog   x Urborg Tomb of YawgmothSideboard was a random grab of stuff I thought might help   x Ratchet Bomb   x Pithing Needle   x Extirpate   x Engineered Plague   x Leyline of the Void   x Ensnaring Bridge   x Heros Downfall   x TombstalkerFirst time playing this type of deck in a small event didnt do very well at all. Not an easy deck to play. Played against mostly BUG decks so faced off just about every game versus Deathrite Shaman and opposing Lillianas. I sideboarded in the extra  Engineered Plagues just about every game. Last game was against a Goblin deck and my opening hand was Dark Ritual  Swamp  Engineered Plague in both matches.

2329175,0,t3_2lyz59,Legacy prices have been in a tailspin since gp Richmond. The total format price has dropped  since then according to mtggoldfish. Based on anecdotal evidence I dont think we will see a significant spike happen again this time. My lgs has tons of duals priced at or below Tcg low. They are sitting there not selling. I believe that the Richmond gp did more damage than good. I know a fair number of people who were considering eternal formats prior to that price spike. The majority simply found another hobby. From talking to them it goes something like this standard is a money pit and thats fine if you want to use your entertainment budget that way. Modern is ban happy and its hard to justify the investment when there is a historical precedent for routinely banning decks out of contention. Legacy is too hard core you will struggle to find people who can play interesting games with you because the average player would rather open a box than own a force of will. Cracking packs is just more fun for most people. I also feel like we are seeing the effects of a speculation bubble popping. People seem to be realizing that there isnt a ton of money to be made investing in cards. Combine that with the aggressive reprints by wizards and you end up in a potentially very bad place. holding wurmcoils or goblin welders feels pretty bad when they can be picked up for  what they were a month ago. I think a lot of people are getting rid of their spec boxes. Based on my feelings recent trends and anecdotal evidence it is my belief that legacy prices will continue to stagnate and drop.Ive been wrong before so who knows. ,MTGLegacy,clzlkn1,9,t5_2x2p0

Additionally when I first started playing in Japan most but not all people were able to explain to me in Japanese what a card did in simple terms if it was something technical that I couldnt really read well enough to understand.If youre not confident in reading the cards I would stay away from limited formats but in constructed especially slow changing formats like Legacy both players tend to know the card pool well enough that its not a problem.Thanks for writing the report.,MTGLegacy,cntrb7p,1,t5_2x2p0

You need to make at least  mana to tutor for Ad Nauseam  dark rit  other source  Infernal Tutor  LED   mana. Ad Nauseams probability of winning increases with any combination of black or blue mana floating. If you can get both get both black and blue mana floating before you cast Ad Nauseam if not then prioritize black mana obviously. DO NOT go below  life unless you absolutely have to. This is obvious because past in flames and tendrills of agony will drop you dead.

One copy of dryad arbor is great in a deck like this youd want more green fetches. Once you get an equipment on the field you can flash in dryad arbor by fetching end step and then equip and swing. Youre going to want a few wastelands eventually. Im also not sure if you can consistently cast Hymn on turn two with the wildwoods and  plains but youll need to test it.For the sideboard try to fit in  Gaddock Teegs. Maybe for abolish and SoLaS. Also Id cut an engineered explosives for a surgical extraction.Between the shocklands bobs and thoughtseizes youre going to be taking a lot of damage from yourself. You will lose games from this especially to delver and ANT decks. Dont get discouraged by this. Youre right in saying this deck is grindy but against combo you will need to rip their hand and kill them quickly.Look at the Source for better information I havent played the deck since Cruise was banned so I dont know what optimal lists look like.

As some of the other posters said you have a strong matchup against the fair matchupsDeath and Taxes Shardless bug and the bugamerican delver matchups and miracles which is great since miracles is so huge right now. You have okay matchups against ANT and RUG delver. The major thing I am skeptical about with JUND right now is that the omnitell decks are  miserable for you and they are growing in popularity.

4394190,0,t1_cskwl8l,That is unusual. Most lists have one or two Emrakuls and four of both Omniscience and Cunning Wish. The plan is usually to go Show  Omni and then dig with cantrips for Wish which is for Eladamris Call and then Emrakul. Another option you might consider is board into V Clique to play in response to Show on the stack. You may be not able to counter a Show off of Boseiju but you can try and fight a counter war over the Clique and if you win you can take the Omniscience from their hand. ,MTGLegacy,cskyll5,1,t5_2x2p0

So there is that... Even at the local tournies had pressure and a second RIP with a CP in hand they just never get there...ONLY  time in testing after I dropped a RIP were they able to get it off the board and rebuild while I was getting flooded. So I know its possible just like all magic games preparation for variation is required.  But waiting till Turn  while I sit with a single counter and RIP seems bad while you combo off after you take the counter out of my hand or force me to use it on the piece you were going to take it away with anyways...,MTGLegacy,csotq1g,1,t5_2x2p0

Id highly recommend setting these kind of tournaments up since they can be run independant of the LGS and hence proxies can be whatever you wish  we actually have full proxy as perfectly fine but the time commitment of joining a  week long tournament means that most players are generally quite invested. The prize pool is also a bunch of Legacy staples to encourage buying into the format.

4856241,0,t1_cu5o1wf,gt Isnt Mentor Miracles the natural evolution of Ponder Miracles from GP NJ?I consider the natural evolution to be a list similar to the one Philipp and his team played at GP Lille which you can find at the end of the article.  It is updated and streamlined but still plays Jace and Entreat as win conditions as opposed to Bonannis main deck Mentors and Dazes.gt I am not sure why people would believe s Ponder Miracles to be clunky.The miracle cards are clunky by nature and Jace Entreat and Snapcaster are mid to late game cards that can make the opening turns awkward especially if the opponent is trying to do something silly.  Claudios deck especially the Dazes make interaction easier as well as significantly reducing the number of uncastable spells in a given opener and reducing the strain placed on the low land count.gt I still believe Omnitell is the most ideal in terms of consistency its a deck requiring fewest win condition Emrakul with tons of cantrips and tutors wish. If you are a believer of that school of thoughts then MD  Mentors really is too much.When a deck plays  cantrips plus Digs I have to agree.  I dont quite see how that relates though.  This isnt about swapping win conditions into the same Miracles deck to try to gain consistency.  The concept I was trying to get across was that adjusting the way Miracles approaches a game can allow it to minimize some of the inherent weaknesses.  Similar to how back in  adding Ponders reducing lands and adjusting the curve was effective at reducing a weakness of the deck without significantly sacrificing power level.gt Is there benefits for running  Mentors?  Yes traditionally decks like Shardless BUG decks have multiple angles of attack and ways to gain CA are difficult for Miracles. To establish control you want to for until Terminus cards like Shardless or Dark Confidant dont allow that. With Mentor you kick the ball back to their court. You are saying I dont care about your cute stuff answer this now or die to it.  Mentors are not meant as answers they are threats such that you dont need to answer or run answers in your deck.What is your opinion the different game plans of Mentor versus Ponder variants?gt I highly doubt running  Mentors would improve your StormShow and Tell MUs. If youre referring to slower combos like Aluren or Food Chain that might make sense.The point is that you play more counter magic as well as more counter magic that can be cast for zero or one mana.  The faster clock is just a bonus.,MTGLegacy,cu6nz6y,1,t5_2x2p0
4909357,0,t1_cud9zkt,Thank you for the response. I have some counterpoints I have but by no means is this a dismissal of what youve said!gtThe problem with RiPHelm Miracles is that its horribly durdly and has a lot of dead stuff. The thing i like about this deck is that you have a gameplan early and then a plan B to go from there. Miracles is already durdly but this has a more proactivr early game i feel.gtThe Energy Field isnt great without Rest in Peace the Helm isnt great without Rest in Peace Rest in Peace isnt great against nonGBx decksWell RIP is great against anything that uses its graveyard which are a lot of decks. Tin Fins Dredge Storm Reanimator ect. So while it is good against GBx I dont think its necessarily accurate to state its not great against decks that arent GBx.gtits hard to land Blood MoonThis is true but I like that its MB  Post hate. Not super relevant in the grand scheme but still nice.gtEnlightened Tutor can make for cool plays but its also card disadvantage.I would disagree with this only because in this case with how it interacts with things I dont think this is  true. When it tutors for hate it helps me put resources towards other problems. This gives me long term advantage because I dont have to worry about specific things anymore.It also works well with CB because if I know I dont have a card Im looking for in my top  with Top CB or I dont have Top I can tutor for the card with matching CMC. This will help generate advantage by letting me counter my opponents spells without losing further cards plus I can counter AND bring out hate.On top of that it can be used to more reliably fetch CBTop which in of itself is card advantage. With all the deck manipulation already in Miracles its hard NOT to be able to guarantee this by super early.gtEverything also revolves around RiP which just dies to Abrupt Decay decay on RiP as you activate Helm is such a bad feelingYoure totally right about Abrupt Decay giving this deck the feel bads. But its not true to say everything revolves around it. Only two cards are dedicated to a RIP combo energy field and Helm and two of them are RIP itself.The rest of the deck works independently. I still have Jace and Entreat for wincons and Ive used each to win at some point.,MTGLegacy,cudd0jo,1,t5_2x2p0

You are pretty much DampTs but you get to play more utility A.K.A silver bullets via Green sun Zenith.   If you want to end games faster then you should play DampTs.  Maverick is a grind.   You can end games fast but thats not really your goal.  Its to get to a point where you win in a couple of swings with Knightsbears.   Dark Confidant kind of ruins your long game plan and if you are going to play Dark Confidant I think you should just play the aggro loam list that got top  in GP Lille.   I would cut the Dark Confidants and Geists for more green sun targets.   Go up to  Thalias thats your best card vs. combo.  I would play  Libraries.   Then take your pick of spicy cards.   Scryb Ranger Eternal Witness Garruk Relentless Sylvan Safekeeper Fauna Shaman Sword of Fire and Ice Crucible of Worlds etc.I have a lot of spicy cards if you want to talk.

Thanks for the help!,MTGLegacy,cvempk4,2,t5_2x2p0
5223222,0,t3_3mjtas,ANT is still top tier TES is close behind.DDFT still exists but I havent seen it played at largerthanFNM events since I started playing legacy so I cant comment on how it is relative to how it was.I imagine BelcherSIOops are all still about the same as how they were able to win games but not good for large events.  Still facing the problem that Force of Will exists.High Tide enthusiasts still hold true but the deck has taken a huge hit in the past few years.  Counterbalance decks got much better and Dig Through Time has made main deck copies of Pyroblast a regular occurence which does not bode well for the monoblue deck.As far as nonstorm Omnitell is the cream of the crop.Elves is very good.Reanimator is on the downswing but never a bad choice.Lands is in a terrific spot if you consider that combo.MUD isnt bad if you consider that combo.Other decks like Dredge Painter Enchantress Aluren etc. are out there...somewhere...,MTGLegacy,cvfl918,14,t5_2x2p0

5282853,0,t1_cvmj4rv,In general Thoughtseizing a threat is better than holding up mana to hopefully counter that same threat and much better than trying to kill the threat when its already in play. Esper plays Thoughtseize because of this. Jeskai makes up for not having Thoughtseize by having Blasts and Bolts. Bolt takes pressure off your Swords by giving you redundancy. This Bant list you have has almost no way to deal with resolved threats. Thats okay if youre MUD and your guys are Wurmcoil Engines and always win in a fight. The guys in your list arent that big though. Id also just say as a general deckbuilding point that  Spell Pierce is something you should confine to tempo decks as control decks need to dedicate slots toward creature control or they dont have a chance to develop.,MTGLegacy,cvmy2bc,3,t5_2x2p0
5286263,0,t1_cvndmij,Personally I favor therapy over thoughtseize.

Against decks like storm and in the mirror trading resources like this is really important.Against decks where therapy is less consistent but I still want to have discard as interaction painter miracles RUG delver I prefer  therapy  thoughtseize but I usually wouldnt want more than  anyway. And in matchups where I want to trade resources aggressively mostly just in the mirror I would bring in  therapy  thoughtseize because the only cards that really matter typically are glimpse and natural order so missing with therapy is not too bad.Let me know how the packmaster is I think I am going to pass on it for the event tomorrow but I might test with it at FNM.,MTGLegacy,cvndroi,1,t5_2x2p0

5453143,0,t3_3pp07r,Ive actually played this deck in events before SCG Open and a lot of MTGO dailies. The biggest problem with this deck is consistency. People saying that this is a worse version of Sneak and Show are wrong because this is just a worse version of Belcher. I was playing with  FoW and  Misdirection in the deck but the main problem is actually comboing. Belcher is a super consistent deck and almost always does its thing on turn one. This deck is explosive in the sense that if you resolve a Hypergenesis you win the game. There is also the edge that your opponent doesnt know how the card works and you beat them that way too Ive won a nonzero amount of games where my opponent reads the card and let it happen. My list can be found here It hasnt been updated in a long time but the goal of my list was to cut down on nonsense. Lots of people want to put stuff in their deck that doesnt win the game. The main route to winning is just putting Omniscience or Griselbrand into play and then youll probably win the game after that. Because of this I would cut the Enter the Infinites in the deck and play another ProgenitusMaelstrom Wanderer and a Hypergenesis in the main deck. This deck isnt going to be good into a field of Miracles or control style Stoneblade decks people dont play these so much anymore. You can be a daze out of Delver decks sometimes and if you have a good hand you can forcemisdirect their forcespell pierce. However against other combo decks your game is really punishing because uninterrupted you just do your thing and go and have counters to stop them. Against nonblue fair decks you do well too against most stuff other than Thalia. Overall this isnt a great deck to introduce yourself to Legacy. You get lots of real cards in  Force of Will some good duals other than Taiga Fetchlands Shardless Agents etc. You can transition this into playing Omnitell or Sneak and Show pretty easily without having to get too much more on top of it. The problem with this deck is that youre not going to learn much about playing Legacy. Your games end fast in either direction. Its good in the sense that you learn how to play combo decks but its not good in the sense of understanding the insandouts of decks in the format. ,MTGLegacy,cw8ow27,1,t5_2x2p0

Its not a deck you can make make the best play each turn and expect to win.  Watching great storm players know the storm count in there hand all times and playing around what there opponents are going to do even getting people to help add to the storm count.  Its a stupid good deck and rewards the best and most creative pilots.  Most likely you wont win the box but its a great place to start practicing the deck.

5637675,0,t1_cwvoemd,Arcane Lab works well with Patron Wizard basically syncopating your opponents spells as long as you can make land dropsplay wizards. Its nearly a hardlock with Teferi out. That way you can tap out with even more confidence. Just got to watch out for instant removal.x Venser is a good catchall for things like abrupt decay opposing tops or permanents that snuck through before your lock was established. Given that Im not as sure about the countertop lock  though it wouldnt harm having both engines at work. Also consider mutavault as an additional land to up the wizard count converting land drops into force spikes with Patron Wizard and top spins with Information dealer. The only thing it possibly interferes with is Patron wizard but x wouldnt harm.Given you have Aethermage for tutors Id recommend only  copy of Azami and x copies of the vedalken. Depending on how you play I dont think racing with LabMan is fast enough but you can instantly cycle  vial for versatility.Information dealer is a pretty good card. After turns  youre basically stacking your deck. Synergy to findstack with counterbalance as well. Are there enough shuffle effects for brainstorm? If youre going the Arcane Lab route consider also adding the colorshifted Rule of Law to make use of flooded strand.

He finds most of his foreign cards asking dealers at GPsOpens as oftentimes they have some out back that theyre having difficulty selling due to a niche market. Last year at GPNJ he found quite a few dealers who were willing to trade foreign cards for English ones straight up as its much easier to sell English copies online.  Edit sweet deck!

6306622,0,t1_cz5gll1,.  Michael Derczo has had quite a bit of success with a taxheavy build of DampT which maxes out on Vryn Wingmare.  IMO that version of the deck has better game one scenarios vs many decks but gets hit by sideboard hate  effects very had.  His builds either play Veteran Armorer or WiltLeaf Liege to try to compensate for that.  The alternative is to play a more aggressive route that plays a large number of Mirran Crusaders which are devastating against the Tarmogoyf decks of the format.  This version will close out games much more quickly than Derczos version but has a few less hateful cards for the unfair decks.  Ive posted a generic decklist for you here though keep in mind that the deck may pick up a few cards from the new set..  Its easiest to win the lands matchup in the first few turns of the game.  An early aggressive start can get the damage done before they can stabilize.  Punishing Fire Maze of Ith Tabernacle and Life from the Loam can all be problematic as the game goes long.  In general hold your Flickerwisp to deal with Marit Lage tokens though feel free to use them to destroy a Mox Diamond if you get the chance early on.  In postsideboard games Rest in Peace and Cataclysm are fantastic particularly if you get both together.  If you live in an area where Lands is prevalent e.g. Baltimore youll probably end up skewing your deck a little bit to make that matchup easier by including larger toughness creatures in the main Brimaz and by packing an extra graveyard hate card or two.,MTGLegacy,cz6hppw,1,t5_2x2p0

Spikes are when prices go up suddenly and then undergo price correction.MTG finance crowd uses price correction strangely.The notion that a price is incorrect absent hype is backwards. Price corrections are price movements with respect to actual demand as opposed to speculative value. I mean the concept of a correct price in economics is a little weird at its core because any price that makes buyer and seller better off is correct. So if it means anything its got to refer to price based primarily on firstorder demand which is almost never too low unless sellers are sold out rather than secondorder demand speculation.Any upwards change in price immediately following an announcement of a product that could spur future demand isnt a price correction. Thats hype.After Eternal Masters releases if there are lowdemand Reserved List cards that arent as liquid as people thought then their subsequent price drop is a correction.,MTGLegacy,d18gj4e,3,t5_2x2p0

My mainboard is  Force  Recall  Discard  Sylvan  Malestrom  Wastes with all the other regular cards. I picked up the deck originally with Lejays  from BoM almost  years ago? Wow seems like a while now And a lot of my mainboard and side board reflect his original list. Overall Im pretty happy with my sideboard I just changed into the rd Baleful strix post board with the rise of Eldrazi. However I have been toying around a lot with Bitter Blossom in that slot. One of my Disfigures has been a Golgari Charm on and off and the NoSB has occasionally been an E Plague.And I saw you question replacing Leyline with Spellbomb the cards both exile cards in graveyards but they are good against two different decks. Lands is a pretty nightmare match up for us unless you can secure access to mana turn off punishing fire and not die to random s. The one of Leyline makes that match up a lot better while Spellbomb should still be brought in most good lands players can beat it pretty easily.

7137268,1,t1_d1pf2z1,The ones banlist could fix?  Miracles dominate the format. I dont want to see the deck go but for the sake of diversity  I would love to see a buff to other control archetypes. Current control contenders are RG lands BUG Delver and Esperblade. Perhaps Mind Twist would prop the black ones up a bit.  Survival of the fittest. It is time. The cards is deep skillintensive and cool. The last time it was around the format had no DRS Decay or RiP and a tier deck didnt play x revokers mainboard. In a format with Show and Tell unrestricted its surprising to see a worse enabler in the banlist.   Goblins. Goblin recruiter could use some love. Food chain combogoblins anyone? Proper goblin aggro? Redbased decks will improve the colorpie share of red and will be a great contender in all archetypes. As a DnT player I have personally ran some tests in cockatrice against the cards I mentioned against friends. DnT is not the best deck atm but even DnT can handle it all well.

7730696,0,t1_d3ks893,gt This deck is super solid against combo. Having been playing it for years at this point and this being the only deck outside of combo I play I feel as though I know what I am talking about and have the experience to back up my claims. Multiple years of reps under my belt with this deck has gotten me to a list that has proven and continually beaten to a positive record all forms of combo and the top decks of the meta. This accounts for about  of the meta having just looked and added it up via mtgtop its miracles eldrazi various bug decks storm reanimator landsloam and infect.gt Half of the field is positive matchups and the way the deck is built minimizes consistency errors. GPs have a way of the top performing decks rising to the top of the standings. This is where stompy shines currently as it eats up the top decks. Id be deluding myself if I was doing terribly with the deck and spiked one tournament but the consistently high records Ive been getting say otherwise.You sound like a Modern player with babbys first brew. If this deck is indeed a real thing then why hasnt it caught on? Why after this list being around for years has Eldrazi been the goto Stompy deck despite being only months old? If this deck really is as good as you say it is why arent more people playing it? The list seems pretty budget for Legacy so one would think it would be a more attractive entry point than something like Eldrazi.G you even knew what your opponent was on and you still lost. And then you lost your winandin to some random tier  jank.A local meta gets stale and inbred and theres no guarantee that the pilots of decks are even that good.

7791266,0,t1_d3rrsbd,BG Elves evolved precisely to improve the matchups against very fair decks as the old lists relied very heavily on being able to resolve a Glimpse. If your Glimpse gets Forced it could set you back multiple turns until you drew another one off VisionarySymbiote loop. On the other hand a resolved Glimpse usually means going full combo drawing the entire deck as pretty much the only dead cards once you start cycling are the lands and it runs fewer lands than modern lists and x GSZ which you can use to get Symbiote to keep looping with. So I wouldnt recommend it if your meta has a lot of control like Miracles and Stoneblade but if you face regularly against decks that are light in countermagic like Shardless and Jund you could have a nice shot at simply outspeeding any disruption they might have. Combo matchups that are slower than you are also fair game such as Dredge and ANT. But keep in mind that the price you pay for getting such speed is to give up on the whole concept of having a late game. Theres no DRS pinging for  no NO Progenitus nada. You could set up a symbiote and Visionary loop to try to build up your hand and Glimpse again but its not very easy to do if your first try gets disrupted.As always sleeve it first and try for yourself thats the only way to know if you like it or not ,MTGLegacy,d3rsn8g,2,t5_2x2p0

Submerge is great against Infect BUG variants and even to bounce a  Gerry Thompson.  Id probably also choose between the Clique or TNN and slam a Vortex in there its just so good vs Miracles and Blade decks.My experience with Sulfur Elemental has been mixed.  Sure it kills MoM Flickerwisp and Thalia but ive def been on the receiving end of a large Mirran Crusader or Serra Avenger due to it and it doesnt kill Stone Forge Mystic.

8174034,0,t1_d4z156o,gt which is part of the reason why I bought into the format because who in their right mind would spend  on a game without having an exit strategy?Me. Ive spent a few thousand playing EDH on a competitive level for a few years now. But only because the cards needed to employ the strategies I wanted cost that much. I dont plan to exit this format because that would mean I stop playing my favorite format. Why leave something that you like?gtI play the format because its the best format MTG has right now. But a significant price drop would have an effect on me because it not only devalues the time that I spent earning money to acquire the cards I own but also means that if for some reason I needed to cash out of the game I wouldnt be able to do so for the same amount of money that I was promised via the RL I would be able to get back.I keep seeing that best format  Return on investment by selling cards. And that isnt always the case. You could consider running your deck in tournaments and earn a prize by winning that tournament. Therefore you can earn an income without having to liquidate your cards.The best format should not be a rich mans club which excludes those whom work full time in retail level jobs from honing their skills in Wizards Sanctioned Tournament Play.I will not feel sad that all my hard work earning those few grand put into my competitive decks will be worth less in the future.

8198096,0,t1_d525jf3,yes but as shown with X costs and cost reduction effects the cost can be variable. Converted Mana Costs are different and I was just basing my now admittedly wrong assumption that if Goblin Electromancers effect adds one to X as a form of paying costs that casting without paying its mana cost and Thalia worked similarly as in Thalia added to the cost of the spell and wasnt treated as an additional cost,MTGLegacy,d52bcuj,1,t5_2x2p0
8211631,0,t3_4rsf23,Looks solid. Wo knowing your meta I cant comment on the flex slots but my thoughts on the tier meta for now are  There are a lot of DRS decks around. Grixis and Shardless run wild. I opted to play Warping Wail as additional removal and it counters some of their sideboard hate too  helps against miracles storm and elves. Bonus points  it kills mom and revoker in mirror bob and staticaster mage and poops on infect.  Since I have more DRS answers than usual I cut out x Revoker and moved x revokers to the side. I filled the opened slots with Leonin Relicwarder. It eats a lot of stuff in many matchups like sneak attack and omni vs show and tell or exploration vs lands and often acts as a th and th flickerwisp  saves my own vial and equips from removal. As a result im a bit weaker against hardcast sneak attack and JTMSLilly game  but Im much better equipped to deal omniscience and jittechalice game  against Eldrazi.  In the lands department I had to put  C sources to support warping wails so I have x cavern and x mishra. More plains got cut in favor of flagstones for sideboard cataclysms and horizon canopy it is good when shit hits the fan.  There are a lot more bolts than decays in my meta so I cut mirrans and got Brimaz  Banisher priest instead. Brimaz survives bolts and priest poops on Eldrazi.

Plus some SBs run bloodmoon I dont in my list and a lot of times that will lock out Eldrazi. On the other hand RUG is geared to go vs the longer game. Goyfs are goyfs. Delver does its thing. Generally two flex counters are spellsnare which will hit chalice. And it generally has more gas than UR.

DnT is wayyy more grindy and while its a meta deck stopping combo mana denial and the ability to drop t batterskull is usually a really good place to be. People often say that the deck isnt great due to its lack of card advantage but it makes up for this with repetition. Furthermore even if you flood your lands do things that are usually pretty awesome. Example hand wasteland rishadan port Karakas Thalia cavern of souls horizon canopy vial.

Because of that fact these cards are extraordinarily expensive and act as a barrier for those who wish to get into Legacy with any competitive success. While there is always a top deck in any format standard is a big Bant Compant jerkoff fest right now the top dogs in Legacy never really change due to a significantly smaller group of new cards that are playable there thus leading to a smaller pool of decks that can compete. Eldrazi was a big shot in the arm no doubt but people are finding ways around that deck now and its slowly being pushed back.

The core of all the HexDepths versions is pretty strong.  Which one you decide to try is more of a personal play style choice until you figure out which one you think is best.  There is a breakdown of the different versions and some tidbits on the differences here  Its the type of deck you can certainly spike a smaller tourney with ish players or top  a medium sized event but not a deck you can expect to live up to the truly consistent decks of the world think Miracles over  rounds of a major event.  ,MTGLegacy,d7hfeuf,6,t5_2x2p0

No Force version actually has a lot of raw power and consistency too despite its weakness to hate compared to the FoW version.For a Forceless version Id look at something like thisDredgers    Golgari GraveTroll   Stinkweed Imp   Golgari Thug   Shambling Shell  Discard Outlet    Phantasmagorian  Creatures    Ichorid   Narcomoeba   Prized Amalgam   Nether Shadow   Bridge from Below  Disruption    Cabal Therapy   Chancellor of the Annex  Resurrection    Dread Return   Balustrade Spy   Flayer of the Hatebound  Acceleration    Street Wraith   Gitaxian Probe  Sideboard    Blightsteel ColossusProgenitus   Mindbreak Trap   Contagion   Unmask   Ashen Rider   Faerie Macabre   Chancellor of the Annex  You can then build to the blue version I outlined in an articleJust note that no matter the version you cannot beat Leyline which is fine because only a narrow amount of decks run it and they often mulligan into oblivion for it.Also per usual The Source is excellentI have quite a few posts there with recent tournament reports etc. where my sideboarding choices are outlined.Also I made a big comment before which has a lot of interesting information especially on the... Philosophy of the deck and the mindset you have to have as a player. Its here and chains into many other links about the deck Ive posted including a pretty comprehensive tournament reportAnyway enjoy! Manaless Dredge gets a huge bad rap but the deck is incredibly powerful with the new additions and is certainly a great deck to move into the format with  though it will take a certain mindset to overcome the sadness of losing to hate cards so bear that in mind.

I wouldve thought he would say you always counter RIP unless you have  cards and a stifle in which case you use the stifle. Especially with no Bolts postsb and the philosophy of never countering snapcasters.Jons playstyle of the deck is very different from other RUG players. I think that he basically just plays the deck as a pure control deck i.e. as long as you counterkill whatever is going to kill you it really doesnt matter if you are killing them with a goose swinging for  a turn or a delver swinging for  a turn. ,MTGLegacy,da9mst4,3,t5_2x2p0

Additionally you can move into Maverick fairly cheaply if you decide to pursue it further down the road. In short if your local meta isnt combo heavy then the deck will be fine.

10212864,0,t1_dc1nvce,Both ANT and TES are very skill intensive decks.  You must play them regularly or youll get rusty and the deck will continue teaching you new things.  You are going to suck for a while and get stomped a lot.  You will occasionally get an opportunity to actually make a kill and then screw it up yourself and punt the game.  Then youll become an average storm pilot for a while but still punt the occasional game because you miscounted by  mana or something.  Finally youll become an aboveaverage pilot after a year or two.  And if youre like me youll STILL punt a game or two but thats probably because I dont play as often anymore.  Some people really like that about the deck its challenging and unforgiving but mastery of it is very rewarding.  Also since you have DampT in your meta if you find yourself struggling a whole lot you may want to giving TES a spin.  Its better against DampT but ANT is better against Miracles.  But I feel like ANT vs. DNT is almost impossible whereas TES vs Miracles is at least doable.

Its not the best pressure or the most mana efficient card... but its the best of both worlds and this goes the same for Delver of Secrets.I actually feel the same way about Horizon Canopy.

Echoing my thoughts from there I question the utility of Emperion against Burn. Ive had too many games lost to Smash to Smithereens to comfortably play it  maybe your experience is different? Sideboard Bog looks weird to me though in a Bant build I can see the manabase being too clunky with it in the maindeck.

I dont even own a Vexing Shusher and I havent been running Pyroblast since Firecraft was out.I have a weird Burn deck in that I run Plateaus to have WearTear and Deflecting Palm in my sideboard and WearTear happens to be better than Destructive Revelry or Smash to Smithereens against Counterbalance but if youre monored Smash to Smithereens is more than worth it and you should do good!Miracles cant deal with Firecraft and has a hard time Counterbalancing Fireblast only Terminus is  CMC. Thats  cards for  damage each. On the downside they will fetch basics if they think we have Price of Progress game  Id side them out afterwards and Eidolon can be a horrible topdeck if they have any resilient threat.They can still get you with an early Entreat for  or more or when a Mentor goes nuts early kill those! but you should have your own nut draws too.,MTGLegacy,ddbidz3,4,t5_2x2p0

10892398,0,t1_de3ftu8,Right you can build the deck to work with Ancient Tomb but its not going to do much if you just shove it in the deck.  With the creatures in my shell for example  WW three drops and Serra Avenger arent going to really benefit from the acceleration while only my two Recruiters will.  Revoker on turn one also usually isnt great at least in game one when you have minimal know about your opponents list.  I would get almost not real benefit from the card and the drawbacks would almost certainly outweigh the pros.If you build your deck around things like THC Aven Mindcensor and maybe even Vryn Wingmare then Ancient Tomb starts to have some true upside.  I played around with those ideas quite a bit but once I started to go down that rabbit hole the decks very quickly became something very different from DampT.Im actually a big fan of the Ancient Tomb in the Vintage version of the deck.

So if you make tons of mistakes it still has a chance to get there.  But it takes an incredible amount of skill and experience to get to play it well .Other decks with high floors like burn have such high floors because theyre simpler and a newer player will likely make far fewer mistakes than another deck.

How does that make sense ?gt Value of cards will maintain prices much better with the reserve listYou are confusing cost and value. You should not. The value is dropping. The cost is rising. Reprints would increase the value whether or not the cost dropped.gt how many people have you seen that will proxy up a vintage or legacy deck and play it over and over? If they are then they will normally then shell out the cash for those decks otherwise they go back to whatever formats they played originally.Interesting question.

11230551,0,t3_607zr1,I dont know where exactly to answer I hate Reddit... so I just put it here. Ive been playing Esper Miracles for a while and its been great so far so I just wanna share my biased opinion. Some points in random orderPyroblast is a huge loss. Of course! It cant be replaced and I wouldnt compare Cabal Therapy to it. Therapy serves a different role and just works fantastic with Mentor Probe Daze Snapcaster and the overall more proactive approach. Esper Miracles at least as I know and play it is more of a synergistic Mentor deck than Miracles could ever be. Pyroblast is the one and only reason for the RSplash. Also as an response to this quote Blood Moon Ruination From the Ashes Izzet Staticaster if we are mentioning more cards. All the other red cards that see play in the SB would not warrant a splash in my opinion. Who plays Izzet Staticaster anyways I love this card btw.? Blood Moon is just terrible more often than not and I dont see the need for either Ruination nor From the Ashes. Those seem to be cards that help you win games you already lost or pull you even further aheadseal the deal when youre ahead anyways. I think neither is necessary. Those cards might be good but theyre not a huge loss.Esper is the underdog in the mirror against UWr. They have Blasts and therefor the stronger Snappy aswell and JTMS is of course superior to BabyJace. Its not unwinable I am  against UWr Miracles but not a MU Id expect to win. Painful Truths is better than Predict if you are proactive. Sure it costs  more and is sorcery speed but the draw  extra card is pretty important. Its not about finding specific cards but just refueling your hand to throw random spells at your opponent while you have a Mentor in play or while both of you are in topdeck mode. Its also just stronger with BabyJace. I agree that Predict is way better in any nonMentor build. I think Mountain is a terrible Magic card but without a Mountain in your  Disenchant is more tempting than WearTear anyways if youre up against Wasteland decks. Most decks against which you wanna board in a disenchant effect play Wastelands Lands Eldrazi DnT to name the most important ones and most Lands players switched from Port to GQ anyways making R really awkward. So I dont even think playing Disenchant instead of WearTear is strictly worse. The only MU that Dark Miracles shines in over UWr is Sneak and Show. In all other MUs Dark Miracles is either even most nonblue creature decks or just worse mirror most blue decks. I disagree. Not with the bettervsSampSpart mind you! P It was amazing to see Matthew Larcombe winning  times against SampS during the course of one tournament but thats not the sole reason for Esper instead of UWr. I believe Esper Mentor Miracles is better than UWr Mentor Miracles in g against nearly any deck. After sideboarding that might change drastically but randomly losing g sucks. Sideboard games are up to  out of  games and are therefor more important overall but there are a couple of MUs you really wanna be up a game against before sideboarding such as ANT BR Reanimator and DnT for example because you can always stumble and get punished in one game. Decks I am very much convinced Esper is overall better against DnT SampS ANT Reanimator Infect most random Brews.Decks I am very much convinced Esper is overall worse against UWr Miracles Delver Food Chain Aluren Lands NicFit.All the other decks are about even or I dont have a somewhat qualified opinion yet or seem to unimportant to mention. I just put NicFit there to showcase not all random brews are easier to beat once you go black. P Yes we lose Pyroblast against TNNLeovold.dec but Tasigur and Zealous Persecution are pretty strong and an escalating Mentor the way to win. ProbeTherapy are helping tons. Its safe to say UWr Miracles is the overall stronger build. You dont have a disadvantage in the mirror and a better Delver MU. All Delver decks combined its probably the most prevalent archetype in most paper tournaments. So youre giving up  against the two most played archetypes. On the other hand you increase your g and I am just a huge fan of losing because I misplayed and not because I got unlucky. Additionally I feel like Esper is more rewarding and its just my favourite color combination which is always a good reasoning behind your deck choice. Playing with what youre experiencedcomfortable with always gives you an edge. Long story short and sorry if I repeated myself I probably missed some things I wanted to adress aswell... Esper Miracles is not strictly worse than UWr Miracles and even the better choice in some specific metas but if you wanna win a big tournament you should pick UWr instead. UWr is overall better than Esper just like Miracles is better than Lands or Delver or ANT or Elves or basically any deck... Happy to hear other opinions regarding the mentioned points. edit Please note Mentor Miracles has upsides and downsides over regular Miracles but those do not necessarily have anything to do with the played color combination. I tried to not mention those because thats . a different topic and . would make this post way too long. ,MTGLegacy,df4yuxa,1,t5_2x2p0

11454226,0,t1_dftqpzy,Echoing this which I actually think is something people are not mentioning heh. Waiting to get the payoff cards just means youre opening yourself up to Duress. Maybe with Miracles youre more resilient but when I play Delver I have to sometimes just go after the early rituals to prevent my interaction from just being taken away to hand disruption. So your hand naturally matters a lot. If youre light on interaction then you might have to get it while the getting is available screw them for a turn by bagging a ritual or maybe the second ritual and give yourself a draw and maybe a cantrip to find more answers for the next time they try to go for it.,MTGLegacy,dfubtn3,1,t5_2x2p0

11531206,0,t1_dg2zrpi,I very strongly disagree with this.  I am X against Food Chain lifetime in comp REL events and not much better at regular REL.  Like Elves it is a creaturebased combo deck which have always given us trouble.  We frequently lose to random Griffon beats in games where they dont have the combo as our StP does nothing against those idiots.  Flickerwisp has very few good targets on the other side of the field targeting a Ballista with it is a losing proposition.  Walking Ballista is a terror that threats to wipe our board even without the combo.  Decay answers the equipment that is really our only way to steal games.  I think you get the idea.Sure there are games where we have an unanswered piece of equipment AND a Crusader AND they dont have the combo.  Well win those.  Sure there are games where we protect a Canonist with a Mom AND then have equipment to boot.  Its pretty hard to get two out of the three of these matches though.,MTGLegacy,dg32br1,5,t5_2x2p0
11541981,0,t3_64quqb,The cards theoretically alright the issue Ive always had with it is that it doesnt seem better than any of the cards we can already maindeck.  What have you cut for it? Id certainly be open to at least trying it for a few leagues to see how it works.  EDIT I could see playing a  split with Mother of Runes in a meta full of punishing fires because moms are pretty underwhelming against those decks.,MTGLegacy,dg4aa2o,5,t5_2x2p0

Shock someone every time they Top repeatedly Shock the Lands player Shock Elves for all those Wirewood Symbiote activations etc. If the game comes to a grind Id say this card could be the game breaker since it doesnt hurt you. ,MTGLegacy,dg5ug2l,2,t5_2x2p0

11577750,0,t3_657sg1,My favorite Miracles variant is Show and Tell Miracles decklist here tournament report here It combines the best aspects of locking your opponent out of the game with CounterTop and killing your opponent out of nowhere with a noninteractive combo. Its silly and not meta but it works in an interesting way.,MTGLegacy,dg8cefo,3,t5_2x2p0
11578612,0,t3_657lgm,Seans position on the phyrexian mana is exactly how I feel. I think its a cool mechanic and in while in standard has a pretty limited effect but its in the formats with a lot of the older cards and mechanics where you see how broken it really is. Minus the misstep era the effect has been pretty tame on legacy but we really saw how bad probe was during the CruiseDig era. Its not like the unbanned ones are broken or enable broken strategies in Legacy but there is a high potential for WoTC to print something that abuses them in the future.Honestly all the playable phyrexian cards should probably just be banned in all formats.,MTGLegacy,dg8fx9e,3,t5_2x2p0
11580228,0,t3_657a6p,I would say  If you are straight UG but if you have the white splash sub out one for a Tundra or Savannah depending on your preference Id personally go with  Tropical Islands. I dont think the splash is needed.,MTGLegacy,dg8miz6,1,t5_2x2p0

11620952,0,t1_dgch6l3,Lets also not forget the fact that youre exclusively naming blue decks which is a big no shit. Youre saying a blue deck in legacy has good card draw?

11648433,0,t1_dggcr06,My main differences are that I play a sylvan because landstill is popular in my area and misdirection because hymn decks are still hanging around.

11650942,0,t1_dggiavk,Youre probably right. It seems geared towards identifying what percentage of the playerbase belongs to the different types of players i.e. Timmy or Vorthos.

11717809,0,t1_dgo8ax9,I think that Searing Blaze and Flame Rift are also considerations in either the Swiftspear or Lavamancer slot but this might be the deck that loses the least from its normal version.  fetches  Mountain  Snowcovered Mountain give you nice mana with lots of Searing Blaze landfall and Lavamancer fuel. ,MTGLegacy,dgo8qze,8,t5_2x2p0
