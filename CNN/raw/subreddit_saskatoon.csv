820027,0,t3_23irqm,Nope. Saskatoon does have two locally run entertainment conventions though.

Last year was their first con. Not sure how it went as I didnt attend. The Blitz is usually pretty fun but the location is crap as it is too crowded and for the artist alley. The rooms are nice though and the guests are great. Last year Aaron Douglas came and he was hilarious.

1247526,0,t1_ci9wadn,I agree on using money to maintain our roads they are the worst and everyone knows it. I dont really care about public transportation for myself. I dislike being crowded in a bus with stinky annoying people and the stress it creates not to mention my life it wastes stopping at each stop to convenience others.I love driving. I had a job for  years where I drove as my job and loved it. Time flies when in your own vehicle where as time drags in a bus. Crank the tunes up and drive around plus I love my cars. You also get to your destination faster than any public transportation might change based on rush hour vs distance but I would still rather be in my own vehicle.I am not sure if your reference of traffic congestion and obesity is trying to mean there is a link between the two or not. But I am not obese and I drive everywhere. I dont see how there is a link between how I eat and how I drive. It may be more of a mentality of someone who is biking may be eating healthier. But it is not the physical device itself that is causing a person to be obese.You are right it is a choice to drive as it is your choice to do what you will with your life. We all pay tax and pay for things we dont agree with at times but it goes the other way as well. Tolls and car insurance based on kilometers? Being sarcastic and changing the view back around. Place tolls and property tax based on where you walk? I already pay more to the government than you for driving with car insurance license and gas stations. Here is a link from a study a couple years ago. Look how much gas costs then how much taxes on it are.I already pay the government more tax based on how much I drive. Should food be taxed as well so that the more you walk the more you contribute? Again being sarcastic here but changing it around.There is a cost associated with my choice.,saskatoon,ci9yncz,0,t5_2rbq2

2039861,0,t3_2i5i6b,Ok heres one of the best articles Ive read on the issue   Long story short The city has  unions not including firefighters police etc. They proposed to  of these unions that they would get a  wage increase over  years and that there would be some changes to their pension plan due to a deficit.  The other eight unions agreed to this.  The transit union is a demanding a wage increase of  or close over  years... but also arguing that there is NO deficit in the pension... but in fact a surplus.  So they think the pension plan shouldnt be touched. But then the city had the power to basically veto that shit. Which they did.  Then the transit union got the Labour Board involved.... hoping they would stop the lockout. They didnt. But they did tell the city to stop the changes to the pension plan.So.... here we sit in FUCKVILLE. And Im not a transit user but Ive been following this pretty closely. And I really suddenly feel like a giant douche canoe because every time I chose a side I somehow feel like Im wrong.,saskatoon,ckz412d,10,t5_2rbq2

Its absolute hilarious that as a community we continue voting for Atchison and his ugly mug. Transit may not have had intentions of actually striking yes they voted for it. Strike action can be used in other ways such as a workplace slowdown. Imagine if all the busses were  minutes late to every stop or oh this job is unsafe. Or this bus has a flat tire its out of commission for today. Or what if all of a sudden a cold sweeps through the shopdrivers and half of them call in sick for a week. Just as shitty for transit users but still within reason to keep them on payroll. And even if the city tried to fire them theyd have the union to back them up.

2222664,0,t1_clmbmci,There isnt much of a horizon though. Most of the lines in the frame lead to a single point in the upperleft third area which I think is fine. In fact I think canting the camera more would have added a more dynamic feel to it. Also the initial picture I took had the camera higher and pointing down which looked okay but this downlow look was better. The pole in the foreground wasnt framed correctly and the light streaks were higher in the frame making it look slightly offbalanced. Ideally the camera would have been set further back and to the left a bit but there was stuff in the way. Warmer as in a higher Kelvin number? Or warmer in colour? Im assuming you mean in colour which again is what the initial picture looked like but I wanted the cool colours to stand with the darkness. But like I said the framing isnt completely satisfactory but its certainly not horrible. Looking at it now I think cropping out a bit of the bottom and the right side would fix it.

Thats why we have different speeds in school zones in Regina and Saskatoon but its still covered in general by the Act.If backing into a spot were a ticketable offence in Saskatoon it would have to be covered in Bylaw .

They did not look before turning right I slammed on my bike breaks and they either ran over my bike or directly caused the accident that happened. Now I was crossing on the cross walk riding my bike I had a pedestrian light. I choose to side walk ride as I have been in traffic and choose life over rules amp death. Instead of stopping to see if I was okay or if they ran over my bike. The driver drove away. Bystanders got their plate. I contacted the company and asked them to fix my tire or we could go to cops. He said go to cops. I went to the cops cops told me I would know if I got hit by a car. I said it was not a high speed collision I got up my bike was trashed and they drove away. Secondly my adrenaline was going people walk on broken legs and get stabbed and dont realize when that happens due to adrenaline.  I went to the owner of DJB and said look cops already said you are off the hook. However I should not have been on the crosswalk your driver should have looked. We are both to blame correct. He named Dave agrees. I then say what if we share the cost to replace the tire It would be nothing for you you own a business. I dont even have a job right now. Dave says I will think about it. She did not hit you. I said regardless of what happened without exchanging information she drove away. Dave said well she was scared and we have pictures of the car and an eye witness. I doubt this as he would not let me see the car as it was out working and she drove away.

5324637,0,t1_cvqq53j,See again im assuming you must be uneducated on the subject calling them special snowflakes implies you think the government shouldnt take any extra effort on helping them which they desperately need. When the First Nations communities were colonized and then assimilated through direct discrimination and abuse using an example as residential schools there communities were destroyed you wonder why a majority of our prisons are full of first nations people its because when you are so harshly colonized you lose your culture and that leaves negative repercussions through generations which means first nations youth are in poverty they dont have equal opportunities especially on reserves where they have no economy which means no jobs which in turn equals poverty. The reason there are so many aboriginal scholarships offered is to try to encourage aboriginal youth to succeed but thats not enough when they cant even finish high school they were left in the dust when the Europeans took over and still to this day are left in the dust have you ever visited a reserve? not a nice place and harper knows this but continues to neglect them  reserves dont have safe tap water that means boiling or bottled water if you dont think thats bad enough take a look at housing it looks like a rd world country in half these reserves and with no one to help them they wont get anywhere. People think yeah assimilation was the past they should just get jobs and an education now when there families are so stuck in poverty they cant even get to school thus they remain ridden with crime gangs poverty etc. And now they are the largest growing youth population so do the math that means  years from now Canada has a large mass of uneducated drug addicts alcoholics who will join gangs just to fit in and have some sense of family security money etc Obviously not all of them. But I can tell youre one of those people who has no clue so you will continue to ignore them vote harper and then wonder why they are all so fucked up and why are they are fucking up our communities. This is coming from a white person who knows whats going on if you listen to harper and think it will just fix itself well not only are you mistaken your also ignorant to why you are mistaken. Harper doesnt give a fuck because he simply doesnt have to right now he can ignore them and there arent too many immediate repercussions but believe me once we anyone but fn are the minority and soon to be then youll be sorry that we never helped these communities adapt too what we believe is civilized.

It is far more likely that Lean is but one of many strategies that might or might not have an impact on healthcare delivery.gt The reality is that there are a multitude of internal and external variables that impact complex healthcare and process outcomes and that the independent effect of a specific intervention such as Lean is potentially minimal.

We all know its federally illegal still and we all know that the plan is in motion to change that.  You arent contributing anything to this conversation at all except for being annoying by repeating the same thing over and over and over again.  Because its the law is not an argument that holds up.  Its the same as a shitty parent saying because I said so when they cant outsmart their  year old.  The prohibition of marijuana is outright stupid.  Also getting the jump on the industry is what makes all the difference.  Ever wonder why all the domestic beers are so dominant over beers that actually taste good?  Its because those beers had a headstart on the industry from the days of prohibition.  Seriously.  They were doing things like getting around banning the sale of alcohol by selling peanuts and giving out free beer to people eating peanuts.  Those were Coors Budweiser and Miller.  Sleemans fucking brags about how they were Moosejaw bootleggers.  Getting the jump on an industry and being the actual guys wading through the muck is the difference between an empire and a fringe craft beer.,saskatoon,czr75wo,1,t5_2rbq2

Prohibiting something does nothing to quell a budding problem. If people want to do it they will find ways. That isnt to say that you shouldnt try to stop them but banning something outright doesnt work that way.What people DO respond to are positive incentives. Give them a reason NOT to drive high. Give them an efficient and cheap way to get around town into the core or to run their errands without needing a personal vehicle in this bloated sprawling city.

An assault charge in Saskatchewan is a joke anyways and sometimes its worth it.  They should stick to their little protests by city hospital.  If they dont like abortion then they shouldnt get abortions the world isnt going to be a better place either with or without abortion so their cause is just some religious backed moral crusade that has no place in a. progressive society they have every right to spread their message and if they want to knock on my door and try to chat with me about abortion then so be it.

8075701,0,t3_4ptozc,gtHi redditorsYou guys here are super helpful. Thanks for being awesome.We are driving from Sasktoon to Calgary next Saturday in the daytime starting at am with a family that has a toddler. We have a car that we bought after an SGI inspection last week that has run Km and a Mazda.My friend already told me there isnt much between these cities and to have a fulltank of gas before starting snacks a cellphone powerbank and the right tyre pressure.Can you guys please help on the below.The roads appear two laned with a yellow divider. Is most of the stretch like this? How much traffic can I expect both on the same side and against?Im not used to much of freeway driving. What is the speed range that I have to maintain in this freeway. Is it okay to stop on the right kerbside or on the extreme right because the road looks kerbless and opens to farms nearly the entire stretch.I hope there is no flattyre in our ride but if that happens my th tyre is a thin narrow type that can be used only till max  kmph. Till how many kms can I drive with that and how do we get help to fix flattyres?In general can we just park and flag other riders to ask help if required. What sort of vehicles are the safest to flag for help?Is a CAA membership required? We are planning  trips back and forth this year. How much does it cost how easy it is to get help from them?Any other tips that we need to keep in mind.Another similar thread  years old but this one is mostly about winter driving. EDIT grammarFirst thing take a deep breath. It will not be as difficult as you think. Generally highway driving is easier than city. Go a resemble speed and stay alert. The road is mostly  lanes only. The traffic will depend a lot on the day and time you travel but generally pretty busy. You should stick close to the speed limit  km or a little faster assuming the road is good and not heavy rain or something. There is long stretches of road but there are towns along the way to get gas snacks etc. If you need to pull over it is best to find a driveway or crossroad so you get more safely off the road. Otherwise get as right as you safely can when stopping. Your small spare tire will take you all the way to Calgary in an emergency  km sounds fast for those tires they used to say  km but maybe they are better now. Better to drive to the closest town and get the tire changed. People working at gas stations should be able to tell you were to go to get your tire fixed. It is extremely easy to change a tire. Maybe you could watch a youtube video on it and practice with your car before leaving. I dont know how others feel but I would feel comfortable getting other drivers to help you. If you want leaving the hood of your car open is a sign that you need help on the road. Even if the problem is your tires not your engine lol. People will decide to stop if they have time and think they can help you. I wouldnt worry about choosing a vehicle to flag down. I dont think CCA is required but Id you can afford it it might make you feel less stressed. Cant remember what it cost exactly less than  a year I think. It is excellent. It travels with you no matter what car you drive you are covered. Call them anywhere in Canada they will send a tow truck to change your tire give you a boost unlock your door give you a small amount of gas Id you run out or tow you to town. Hope that helps. Breath easy it will go wonderfully. ,saskatoon,d4ns96a,6,t5_2rbq2

9081838,0,t1_d83cgiw,There is a difference between jokes about men and jokes about women. I know Im wasting my time saying this but its about a power relationship.

That is what these jokes do. They contain a message and a thought that has worked to oppress women for a long time. I know things probably seem hunky dory for white women and compared to more marginalized women things are much better but women are still socialized to accept certain roles in societY that pay less and are supporting roles like being a mom a teacher a nurse.

This will only hinder that already slow growth. A much better option for now would to incentivize organizations to operate more cleanly and efficiently.

But because we have a low population and the global world has very cheap labour and cheap oceangoing shipping it is going to have limits.Geography is destiny and we have the geography of northcentral Asia.

11410980,0,t1_dfnm2jy,One has to be careful with that... it seems the daughters have or have tried to identify him.  Problem is they also are looking to start a case with the human rights commission.  While the case is slam dunk under its own merits the zeal to which those trying to protect the father against someone yet to be convicted of charges  which he should be will take away from what can be awarded to the father.  I really wish they had consulted a lawyer before trying to exact justice in social media.  In a way when you do that it helps the offender.  Dont get me wrong a great message should be passed on to anyone else trying this but that is different than the conflict with the offender and should be dealt with in a separate manner to make both have the most force they can.  Justice is meant to separate emotion from the verdict.  The more you bring it into compensation the more muddied the waters get.  The best vengeance you can get is done slowly and methodically not instantaneously.  The question you should ask is do you want him punished or do you want to feel good venting frustrations?,saskatoon,dfpf7ry,1,t5_2rbq2

Like did they even try anything else?They could sell pretty much all of the bigger buses it seems like the ReginaSaskatoon route is the only one busy enough to use them anyway and buy smaller vans for everything else. Reduce the service to the smaller towns to  days a week. That in itself could reduce costs exponentially. The STC Minister is also insane if he thinks theyre gonna get anywhere even close to what they paid for the new vans back.,saskatoon,dfrfi0w,13,t5_2rbq2

11539156,0,t1_dg3y1yk,OK but the current market all but guarantees further price drops in the next couple of years which means your comparison assuming  growth is very inaccurate when comparing renting vs buying over the next  years.

11549290,0,t3_64n2j0,Interesting. I have been meaning to do this myself as I am evaluating between renting and buying. Our economy is so bad I want house prices to drop faster than they seem to be PIgnoring the fact that home ownership has hasslesbenefits renting doesnt and the space quarters are not the same I think your general assessment is good minus the home value appreciation based on our current economy outlook. But Arts pointed that out. If the owner could afford it and willing to take on the risk one can also take out growing loans against the home to use for investments. If you get income earning investments versus investing for capital gain you can write off the interest for that investment. So there are other perks to home ownership as well from a strictly economic perspective. ,saskatoon,dg545bk,1,t5_2rbq2
