15669,0,t3_1uacjq,I was about  at the time. It taught me that comedy and clever are not mutually exclusive and that the hero doesnt have to be the biggest or the strongest or the cleanest sometimes the kindest and funniest is enough. ,RedDwarf,ceg7uxr,3,t5_2r3d3

249337,0,t1_cf6d7kb,Well I assumed a reboot would start at the beginning. Theres an episode in the first two seasons pretty sure its season  when Rimmer talks about getting fat around   and refers to Lister as being that age. ,RedDwarf,cf6lj6f,1,t5_2r3d3

2505213,0,t3_2o8714,Cat  hes already a cat. But hes perfect as one. Maybe specifically a panther? Or if were going house cats a high maintenance breed.Lister  I think the sloth is spot on because I think theyd be terrible at guitar playing.Rimmer  an animal that thinks its more threateningintimidating than it really is. I suppose a small breed of dog or some manner of bird with a silly mating dancecall.Kryten  mechanoid dog...like everybody else said.,RedDwarf,cmlkin3,2,t5_2r3d3
2704526,0,t1_cnbbczi,Inspired by a similar scene in Blade Runner which one of the shows creators cites as their inspiration to get into scifi.  However that scene is nowhere near as ridiculous.,RedDwarf,cnbht1k,2,t5_2r3d3

5992923,0,t3_3xhonn,Not to sound hipsterish I read the books before I even knew it was a TV show. I was with my parents in a Christian book store in Mississippi one Sunday after church and I asked my dad to get Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers because I thought the title sounded funny. I didnt know anything else about it. Now Im almost  and subscribed to this subreddit. Time flies. I remember in particular one part from one of the books where Rimmer was justifying whos pint of diarrhea hed rather drink than do something or other and that just slayed me. ,RedDwarf,cy57b4b,2,t5_2r3d3
