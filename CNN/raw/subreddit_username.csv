6799416,0,t3_48vgqi,Thats a tough one to answer because youre asking for a generalized username thats also good for specific fandoms too.I guess you could use one of the many namegenerator websites for a specific fandom such as a Hobbit namegenerator if youre a fan of Lord of The Rings.Roughly speaking I find most usernames fit into  categories Real name Shock Copycat Political Bot Personalized Witty Number All caps Descriptive. a real persons name e.g. FranklinMcDonald HelenJeanSnow etc. This type of username tells me the person is perhaps trying to establish their internet identity as a real person. Theyre probably using that same username across many social media websites. Its the internet equivalent to saying You can trust me because Im real look me up. I have nothing to hide. Here are my credentials. Whether that name is indeed their real name is another question it could be a ploy to instil trust. shock usernames not going to list examples use your imagination. These usernames are Hey look at me! Im completely crazy and gross and stupid! Im living on the edge people! Your Mom and Dad would shun me! copycat names e.g. PMMEYOUR... These are bandwagonjumping names created to not standout too much part of the hip cool kids but different just enough to feel individualistic. IMO these are timid usernames because they are minimally creative. political usernames using a politicians name in an ironic manner. For example a Leftwinger might choose the name of a Rightwinger to cause derision or controversy. pretending to be a bot these usernames pretend to be a scripted action personalized usernames these names include something personal e.g. their favourite colour food animal job description expertise etc. They want to personally identify with their username but not give too much information to concretely identify them. witty usernames such as taking the name of a celebrity movie song and changing a couple of letters to turn it into something completely different or humorous. a series of numbers underscores dashes these names are seen as the ultimate in anonymity a cipher a mystery an anonymous source. ALLCAPS a tamer variation of the shock name  What I say is IMPORTANT! LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY! describes content usernames that are descriptive of whats posted in comments e.g. the username SamSpade always comments using filmnoir lingo. This sometimes elicits the response Username checks out,username,d0n08ja,3,t5_2rsyg
