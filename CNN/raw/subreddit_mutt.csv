786498,0,t1_cg7w6gw,Yea I see the collie but those ears look awfully heavy.  Lab was premature I guess on the size spaniel sounds like a solid guess.  Colliespaniel gets my vote.,mutt,cgtogbz,2,t5_2sknb
858731,0,t3_23yuag,Ive been told she is a LabMastiff and a DaneBullmastiff mix.  Shes about  or  months old we think and about  lbs so far. She absolutely loves the water and mud and will dig up the yard if I let her.,mutt,ch1w5ai,2,t5_2sknb

3417053,0,t1_cphr6sl,My only clue to her size would be the whippet in her. Her mashup of characteristics is crazy so hard to pinpoint. For example her coat down her back along her spine is longer and has this sort of marbled wavy pattern to it and she also has webbed toes. Her report just doesnt provide enough answers.,mutt,cphroen,1,t5_2sknb

5630602,0,t1_cwuz70g,Yeah I understand that. But she has the shape and skull structure of corgi. She is very beautiful and an interesting mix. ,mutt,cwv12re,2,t5_2sknb
5718943,0,t3_3tgn21,We had a litter of German Shepherd  Boxer mix at our shelter and they looked really similar to this just more brown. I can also see this being a shepherdbulldog cross. The skull is sort of an inbetween both breeds. Especially if the shelter knew the parents. She does also resemble a pit cross just less muscular. The only way to know for sure is to do a genetics test! Either way you have a great pup on your hands. Just make sure you socialize her. Pet stores like petco are great for this so are dog parks. Do this slowly you dont want to overwhelm her.,mutt,cx5zos0,2,t5_2sknb
