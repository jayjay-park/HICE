161438,0,t3_1vuycq,Just my two cents  I started Groovy with zero programming experience and managed to pick it up fairly quickly. Its a lot less verbose than Java and is an incredibly efficient language for business logic etc. As a side note will you be using this for backend or frontend?,groovy,cewtk2l,1,t5_2qhy2
954141,0,t1_chcqpxv,I played with the M release a bit but theres so much new stuff to digest in . and . Im not ready to jump to . yet.  Probably JuneJuly.,groovy,chcqsk3,1,t5_2qhy2

3469310,0,t1_cpnn6dq,Theyre lying the Groovy Language isnt supported by Pivotal.As for the Groovy community it could be a tautology if you define belonging to that community as supporting Groovy so pretty meaningless statement really like a lot of their claims.,groovy,cpnq5qn,1,t5_2qhy2
8126217,0,t1_d4te9ms,I mean if you know Groovy inside and out than its probably not for you. I would say that I have had some Groovy developers take it and said they learned a lot of little tips and tricks along the way. There is a  day money back guarantee on the course so if you feel it didnt do anything for you there is always that option. Either way Groovy is awesome! ,groovy,d4tgkx1,2,t5_2qhy2
