6475581,0,t3_4483p1,I used the new streaming last.fm has that auto plays recommended tracks in spotify or youtube once but songs kept stopping in spotify and youtube and have to refresh and press play again. After awhile I got tired of refreshing and just used spotify. I hope this improves because I have a large catalog and only using spotify radio is limited.Edit I too miss Last.fms own streaming service. I used it regularly and I when I heard it was going to charge for people to use it I got turned off from it and forgot about it. Then they discontinued it and went to spotify  youtube. As mentioned above nice idea but buggy.,lastfm,czp4dzz,1,t5_2rov3

7967827,0,t1_d4bkkc3,Yep  they were all uploaded at one time. Some of them have the free download button or you click on buy to see the download button.The real issue is that I cant remove this stuff from the index cant remove wiki revisions that contain personal information I no longer want attached to the pages remove images or any of the stuff that I personally contributed.I spoke to CS today and they told me theyd remove the free downloads within  days and remove all of the images immediately but that they could not remove wiki revisions  heshe sent it to the data team. But Im still really concerned that I wont be able in particular to get my real name off of the wiki revisions. It shows up in a google search which I dont want happening.I mean I guess Im just sorta peeved that I cant delete these pages because its not as if I was a signed artist or something  I was selfpublishing. I have no more creative control over that stuff and thats bothersome  especially because most of it is nearing a decade in age. With the music manager gone theres nothing I can do but hope customer service takes pity on me and takes time out of their day to do it manually.,lastfm,d4bnqtj,2,t5_2rov3

9470525,0,t3_5a7v8h,YouTube is still at war with GEMA in Germany so lots of official videos are blocked here e.g. their automatically created artist channels. Furthermore providers like Vevo do not allow embedding their official videos on third party sites like Last.fm which makes YouTube rather uninteresting for German users in connection with Last.fm. You can use a browser with a builtin free VPN service like Opera which circumvents that issue but I rather prefer to listen to the Spotify version with less problems.Of course this connection could be improved as well e.g. with an usereditable link to existing albums on Spotify similar to a YouTube video. That way you would always get the exact tracks from that album and not tracks with the same name but from another album.,lastfm,d9gg4fj,2,t5_2rov3

10925676,0,t1_de6bmnt,One way of combating this is to cross reference tags with a hard coded list of countries and country adjectives e.g. Germany and German or Japanese and Japan then remove those tags and store them in a separate list.I dont think English songs are tagged as English and Id be reluctant to assume that untagged songs are English so removing countrylanguage related tags may be a logical option.,lastfm,de6wo1v,4,t5_2rov3
