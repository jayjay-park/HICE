420141,0,t3_1ywaag,We used to allow longer gear related posts to stand on their own but it causes problems for us later. If I let yours through then other people complain and say why does oblisk get to have their own thread and I end up having to have drawn out conversations about when gear threads are allowed to stand on their own and when they arent. So now I have the following test for threads Is gear being purchased?gtyes  it goes in the gear threadgtno  continue to step  Can this gear question be answered by reading the manual?gt yes  it goes in the gear threadgt no  it can probably be its own thread gtAdditionally Having a separate safari thread allows for it to be searched easier by people later.The search function sucks and isnt used much so I dont count that as a valid argument. ,metaphotography,cfobab8,5,t5_2rfbt
