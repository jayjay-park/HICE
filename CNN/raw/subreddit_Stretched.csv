1622906,0,t3_2cu7gh,I had this same exact problem when I was trying to stretch to  using the taping method. One ear stretched faster than the other which is normal from time to time. I made it to  eventually but it took some patience. If you feel any pain or if you feel like youre having to force the plugs in you are going too fast. Pain means that your ears want you to slow down. Downsizing would be the first step and youve got that down already. Secondly mix some salt with warm water amp use this to soak your lobes  times every day until they are healed. Sea salt works best if you can get some. If you can get your hands on some jojoba oil or Vitamin E oil massage this into your lobes daily. These oils are great for your lobes and massaging helps to get the blood flowing in your lobes.Im assuming this must have happened because you simply stretched too fast. Its happened to all of us but next time just be a little more careful amp listen to what your body tells you. ,Stretched,cjjqee4,1,t5_2tm3i

Do some sea salt soaks and see where it is at in a few days. I managed to heal my ears significantly without downsizing or removing the plugs. After your ear isnt as tender and you dont have broken skin massage your lobes with oil. Most oils work but I recommend jojoba or vitamin E. BUT if you dont see any sort of improvement it is highly recommended that you downsize. Best of luck. Edit just realized in a previous comment that you did downsize.

2909835,0,t3_2tgawj,It hurts because you are letting someone else do it for you and she cant tell when youre hurting and she needs to stop. And because she skipped sizes. It can sting a little on a stretch to the next size if you didnt wait long enough but youre supposed to stop and wait longer. If you dont skip sizes and you wait a proper amount of time between each stretch your tapers will slide in like butter and it shouldnt hurt at all. Somer people may have a little more difficulty than others but actual pain just means you are tearing your skin and that is going to make scar tissue and make it even harder to stretch. I would never let another person stretch my ears. I bought a kit that had tapers and tunnels from g all the way up to g and I even had to buy a set of earrings that were g because my ears hurt trying to stretch from g to g. It was probably cheaper than letting a piercer do it too I think the kit was less than  on Amazon. Thats only like . mm difference but it hurt a lot. After I had stayed at g for a while I was kind of scared to try for g but it didnt hurt at all and the tapers went right in. It left a little discomfort right when I slid it in but that was all.

4271665,0,t3_39wpia,one moreedit The title doesnt make much sense so let me give a little more info. They are  Jet lignite inlaid with Lapis set in silver. The flares are Mayan style so oversized and carved. These were made a few years ago by Onetribe.nu and the designmaterials were picked out by an amazing friend of mine. Even more backstory to these is that these are actually the second iteration of these plugs. The first pair that Jared made ended up going through some difficulties Jet is incredibly soft so he ended up carving red tigers eye and inlaid it within the jet and then inlaid the lapis in the tigers eye. What happened exactly was that he wanted to secure the lapis centers by drilling through the plug and then having the silver in which the lapis was embedded go through that hole and be secured to the back. If that makes sense its kind of hard to explain and I dont know the exact terminology for this style of securement. Anyway when he drilled through the first pair to do this the jet chipped a bit. He was able to save them by using the tigers eye to secure the lapis and the jet. The pair came out beautiful but at the time it wasnt what my friend wanted. The pair that I now have is what was made in lieu of the first the lapis centers are secured with glue which has held up fine over the last few years. A few months back my friend ended up purchasing the first pair that was made. Then this past weekend my lovely friend gave this pair to me... we were best friends in college and she moved out of state so we dont get to see each other too often. Plugsstretching was something that she got into because I was so passionate about it when we first became friends in  so it became a passion we shared.  Now she has an absolutely beautiful one of a kind collection mainly plugs from Onetribe of this caliber though she has a vast array of designs... I was there when she got most of it and this particular pair was always one of my favorites. Its like a little piece of her that I get to take with me. ,Stretched,cs74tsp,3,t5_2tm3i

7127771,0,t3_4d418n,Well you can clearly see the scar tissue there which is likely why its a struggle to continue to stretch. But the tissue around that appears very thick and healthy.I recommend Vitamin E oil. You can purchase this in the USA at Trader Joes or any vitaminhealth food shop. This vitamin promotes regeneration of tissue and should help break down some of the scar tissue.If you can deal with the scar tissue you should be able to have beautiful stretched earlobes by the looks of them. This is why taking it slow is faster in the long run. I never rushed and my lobes are massive at  inches now and keep wanting to stretch bigger.Best of luck!,Stretched,d1ochk2,2,t5_2tm3i

When you get a little bigger Id say the Arctic Buffalo single flare glass plugs work great for dead stretching or taping if you choose to go that route.Youll probably have to work a little extra with your ears due to likely scar tissue from the gun piercing.
