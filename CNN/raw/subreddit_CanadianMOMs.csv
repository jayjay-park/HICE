11202067,0,t1_df0z6ee,I am currently smoking the Green Crack Citrus Sunshine Haze and Vanilla Kush and I would recommend all .  The Green Crack has a mellow mango flavour and a nice clearheaded energetic buzz.  The Haze has a very pronounced citrus flavour sort of a sweet lemon on the inhale and a sour grapefruit on the exhale.  Nice balanced buzz.  The Vanilla Kush has a very subtle vanilla flavour and a very smooth draw.   Very relaxing buzz that preps me for a good nights sleep. ,CanadianMOMs,df1qne1,2,t5_3i30o

11303086,0,t1_dfd15zl,I sorta agree with you. I find this place has users who will start an entire thread slamming a MoM for an issue before they even talk to the MoM. I see headline like Company ripped me off! and people are saying that there is an issue and havent even talked to the MoM. People dont realize that a lot of people see that type of headline and will write a company off with no second thought. I think reviews shouldnt be posted until the entire transaction is done. If there is an issue and they resolve it include that in the review. If they dont fix it then definitely call them out. But at least wait until you contact them and see what they can do. One bad headline can costs a company a ton of customers and it may be bullshit. ,CanadianMOMs,dfd6s44,8,t5_3i30o

11687457,0,t1_dgk75dm,Hi uexpresswayThank you for your comment.The demand is substantially greater than supply.  James one of our founders has been driving around B.C. to look for quad quality flowers for the past week.  Fortunately we are able to refill the inventory with a very limited quantity.  Most of our strains would be out of stock within days with the option of an ounce.In additional Oz selection is available for JJM Bubba.  We are doing the best we could to restock our strains.  Unfortunately the chance of refilling the Death Bubba Great White Shark and Death Star is very slim by the end of the month.We deeply apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you and your understanding of our situation is greatly appreciated. I wish you have a beautiful day.  Yours sincerelyAlexJJ Meds,CanadianMOMs,dgkshcy,1,t5_3i30o

11776246,0,t3_5jem5p,Get Cannabis Online GCO   Ordering Ordered many times easy as usual.  Communication always fast by email and reddit.  Packaging Very professional. Box with vacuum sealed GCO bags inside.  Shipping Had a slight delay but it was all around Easter weekend so no problems here.  Product I got oz each of God Kush Starlight and Purple Candy. All were great was a little worried after seeing another review about the Purple Candy having a mold problem. I have got the God before so I knew what to expect. The bud size in the Starlight and Purple Candy was really good. Starlight is a very nice before bed smoke.  Incentivized  off  sales. They were also throwing in a free mystery .G for order over .
