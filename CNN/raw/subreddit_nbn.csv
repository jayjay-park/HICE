218188,0,t1_cf34ye0,Sorry to clarify  yes there is fibre in the CAN but the fibre doesnt need remediation! Thats what these people are being hired to do  remediate the copper part of the network that the CEPU testified is in a massive state of disrepair. ,nbn,cf3ap4u,2,t5_2s47u
273210,0,t1_cf90j0h,Public IPs are pretty common in the more premium tier ISPs. You mentioned whirlpool  their Broadband choice forum is an excellent place to start. If you like Harbour ISPs pricing and want something similar id suggest exetel If you have a little more room in your budget i would highly reccomend a quality ISP like iiNet Adam or Internode  they generally have AU based support staff and very high customer satisfaction iirc  Internode reached a  last time i checked.  years out of date but generally a good indicator if you scroll down to ISPs.,nbn,cf92viw,3,t5_2s47u
1039383,0,t3_260c3f,Even though this would speed up MTM deployment there would still be alot of Canberra that would not be covered.After Transact ran out of funds to completely cover Canberra in FTTN large areas were left to ADSLADSL wholesale access only.There are some places as suggested by one of the articles comments that can access speeds of around  but I wouldnt think there would be a massive boost in internet speed straight away if NBN bought the network.,nbn,chmfkqv,1,t5_2s47u

NBN Co Australia could be more efficient Id say the number should be more like household for FTTP but itd never be as low as .,nbn,cs1oeqh,1,t5_2s47u

7790254,0,t1_d3rjz7f,if you look at table .a on page  of  you will see that the pricing for FTTN versus fibre plans is identical.nor has the pricing increased since before the last election where the LNP government directed NBN to use MTM technology.the choice of network has had nothing whatsoever to do with retail pricing.,nbn,d3rojaj,-2,t5_2s47u

9681029,0,t1_da5hsn8,gt All this time and money wasted that could have been spent rolling out FTTP. They would have been mostly done by now.not even close...  years to go more likely.most of the cash will go into the continued rollout of FTTN.  some will go to FTTdp.  both technologies will be needed to infill the gap left by abandoning the Optus HFC network with some rebalancing where FTTdp is cheaper and faster to deploy than remediating the copper.I see the additional funding as a very good thing as it means the network will get completed before being sold into penny pinching commercial ownership where all the owners care about is a profit.as for choice of technology thats made by the government of the day and we had out chance to do something about that and failed.  that having been done we now need to do the selected solution as well as possible.,nbn,da6e31a,3,t5_2s47u
