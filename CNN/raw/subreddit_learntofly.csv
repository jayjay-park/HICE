3856502,0,t1_cqvkhk1,People are pretty active in the forums weve got lots of bug report and have to fix those bugs first before we let in another  or more people because we will just create more work for ourselves to keep up with the forums.  Maybe I will send out another batch of  invites today depending how much work is left.,learntofly,cqvvkph,1,t5_333ph

4721094,0,t1_ctplcc3,Interesting. LtF is anything but original if you ask me though.,learntofly,ctpmt28,3,t5_333ph
4757217,0,t3_3g1wg7,Learn to Fly Idle  would be nice but even better in my eyes another game in the Ltf universe but a whole other genre eg turn based fighting game or a city builder. I get that this is probably a lot of work but it is a suggestion anyways. Cant wait for the release D,learntofly,ctu6y0l,1,t5_333ph

5185970,0,t3_3m072z,Yep if you connected your account with the online saves checked a box somewhere when creating new game or loading game you need to create an account first just enter a namepassword combination that doesnt exist. When it comes out on kongregate just load from the online save.,learntofly,cvb3lwd,1,t5_333ph

7843894,0,t3_4mr42e,Someone reported this a while back and I could never figure it out. Did you try maybe refreshing the page and doublechecking all your bodies to make sure it didnt just pop back in?If its really not there I should make a function that rechecks for the medal and grants the dodo body on each shop visit or something.,learntofly,d3xq16y,3,t5_333ph
