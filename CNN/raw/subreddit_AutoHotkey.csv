4701263,0,t3_3fbbgm,The reply you received on the forums is the correct one. You use PostMessage function to send a LBUTTONDOWN system message to the specified window. The system code is x as specied in the forum post.The PostMessage AHK function is a simple wrapper function for the C WINAPI call.        For illustration    BOOL WINAPI PostMessage      Inopt HWND   hWnd      In     UINT   Msg      In     WPARAM wParam      In     LPARAM lParam    Msg parameter is going to be WMLBUTTONDOWN and WMLBUTTONUP which are x and x respectively.The wParam is to indicate the virtual key which will be x for the WMLBUTTONDOWN message and  for the WMLBUTTONUP.the lParam is a single parameter which will indicate the X and Y position of the message ordered so that the X position is the lower order bits and the y is the higher order. So for a bit integer you will need take two  bit integers as the X and Y and then bitshift the Y variable up  bits.so wrapping this up all you will do the following.     PostLeftClickx y id                PostMessage x x yltltx  ahkidid           PostMessage x   yltltx  ahkidid      Which is the answer that was posted on the forums.,AutoHotkey,ctn4sfo,1,t5_2rodl

6860566,0,t3_49q9gj,Gonna go grab my xbox controller and play around for a bit...If I dont post anything else I didnt find anything worthwhile lolEdit Update   I apparently do not have accountability of my xbox controller and am mildly frustrated. Will continue looking and may form a search party later if necessary. Will update you guys when I have more information!Update   Bedroom and downstairs computer room are clean. No sign of the controller. It seems like days...maybe weeks...since Ive seen a cat video or meme. My sugar high has long since worn off and I find myself constantly wanting to go and eat a Snickers or drink a glass of ghetto koolaid. But Im haunted by the thought of what may have happened to my beloved controller so throwing caution to the wind Ive chosen to update my post and continue looking.Ill continue the post when and if I find my cherished controller. Assuming I make it through this alive...Update   Day . Still no controller. Im beginning to wonder if the controller much like the cake was a lie... Its an eerie thought and I try not pondering it too long. For the last  weeks Ive searched for my missing controller and while I havent succeeded quite yet Ive had some positive things occur. Ive cleaned and rearranged my basement including the genocide of all the pop cans. Not something Im terribly proud of but I did what I had to...to survive. I will continue my quest to find the legendary controller of awesomeness. I will continue looking for the foreseeable future.Update   Found like  bucks in change in the couch. Fucking win.Update   . and a canadian nickel. Not sure if those are worth more or less than the US nickel right now.Update   Finally found my controller late last night. Was on a table under a pillow under a blanket under some legs for another table. WTF right? But its cool because everything is clean and organized now. I went from trying to help someone with a script to doing my spring cleaning early. Anyway when I checked back Korbo had already given a response so my journey was all for nothing. sigh Oh well.

7278803,0,t3_4f0ewj,To get a COM object to the current active Excel application you would do the following.    xl  comobjactiveExcel.Applicationthe variable xl is now a com object referring to the currently active excel application.    xl.ActiveCellwill get you a handle to the current active cell. you can get further information using    xl.ActiveCell.Value    xl.ActiveCell.Text    xl.ActiveCell.FormulaWhich will get you the internal value of the cell the displayed text or the formula for the cell. You can assign or retrieve the value by assigning to or from it like normalYou can get the information from specific cells using    xl.Cellsrow column  row and column need to be integers representing a cell in the form y xor    xl.RangeA this uses the visual notation of excels column and rowwhich you can then use any command on like you would the active cell or select the new cell by doing    xl.Cellsrow column.selectYou can also use commands relative the another cell using the Offset command    xl.ActiveCell.Offset .select or value text formula etc.One BIG thing to do when ever you are interacting with Excel like this is to know that if a cell is being edited all of the commands will fail and throw an exception. So always put your code in a try block like so    try            xl.ActiveCell.Value  new text        catch e             Handle it here    There is a useful excel command called Interactive which makes the workbook interactive or not you can make a function to check if the excel application is being edited with a function like so.        IsEditing xlObj             try                     xlObj.Interactive  true                catch e                     return true                return false    There is a lot more that you can find in the MSDN page for Excels Object Model.

That was what I was trying to avoid by using SCD rather than the AppsKey name. Maybe I just dont use that method and stick with the CapsLock amp wAppsKey ampw method. Sorry if this is weirdly formatted I did it on mobile.,AutoHotkey,db397uz,1,t5_2rodl

10019500,0,t3_5j3rrf,no this is not possible since null characters are quite literally nothingeasy way to insert null characters is to use a file object to do your writing and advance the pointer before writing new data. you could also use placeholders in your variables and substitute by addressgt Ive been boggling my mind all day digging through forums trying to find an answer to this...ok so what do you have to show for it. post in such a way that reflects all your hard work otherwise people are just going to assume youre a lying liar,AutoHotkey,dbdkhvl,1,t5_2rodl

10444731,0,t3_5pl4sc,Yes this can be done with autohotkey. Unfortunately no one is going to write code that is going to remap an entire keyboard for you for free. This is a support forum. If you would like to read the documentation and give it a crack go for it. If you come back with an attempt youre much more likely to get help with your code. ,AutoHotkey,dcrzsub,3,t5_2rodl
10566998,0,t1_dd5tn05,Ahhh thank you for explaining that bit about StringSplit. Youre absolutely right that it is in the documentation. I had even actually read it but for whatever reason I didnt understand that at the time. Your explanation makes perfect sense though so thank you for that.And regarding your use of two rand functions you are absolutely correct that your way reads better and works two points my code failed on haha. I really do like your way much better. When I wrote my code I was thinking back to an intro to programming course I took years and years ago in college where the instructor was all about not using two lines of code when one will do or something Im paraphrasing it was an interesting course but I was taking it as an elective. Anyway I just want to thank you again for taking the time to look at my code and reply to my questions. Much appreciated!,AutoHotkey,dd5w03o,1,t5_2rodl

Ive placed this into my script in place of the PixelSearch but now it doesnt close at all no matter what color and the script only works once? Perhaps the problem is in it looping?

WinActivate ahkexe Discord.exe    ImageSearch CoordX CoordY     SelectedServer.png Thatll give you the position where the image starts. So youd just add a few pixels to CoordY and CoordX to click onto the correct server after disconnecting.Theres probably a different way but this seems to work for me.This is the imagefile I used.,AutoHotkey,dehlgiq,1,t5_2rodl

11752490,0,t1_dgs49gl,Ah I see what youre saying.So Send Numpad will do just that as if you had pressed numpad.Ive tested it with both numlock on and numlock off as well as with both using mousekeys and it still sends a . Its because that is technically what numpad does.I tested it using DelClick and it works flawlessly for me. If youre using it in a game and experiencing lag with it its probably the game causing it. As for it not being the same thing as using the mousekeys Numpad it most certainly is. All mousekeys really does it to have your numpad move the mouse cursor and Numpad sends a click command. I mean Microsoft may do it differently but that is essentially what it does.The only other thing I could think of was to check the AHK script that was running and see what AHK is picking up in terms of keypresses. Strangely if you have mousekeys enabled when numlock is on AHK picks up absolutely nothing when you press the Numlock key nothing at all. As a matter of fact it doesnt matter whether you have it set for mousekeys to be enabled with numlock on or off no matter which one you do when it is enabled AHK picks up absolutely nothing in terms of keypresses on the numpad for any of the keys. Toggling mousekeys caused keypresses to be displayed again.Unfortunately it appears MS is intercepting those keypresses and thus not allowing AHK to get them. I dont think there is going to be any other option for you other than to use DelClick to simulate what you are trying to do.,AutoHotkey,dgs6a6u,1,t5_2rodl
