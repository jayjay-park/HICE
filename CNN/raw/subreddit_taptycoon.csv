6166792,0,t1_cyqiwnw,I swear mine lowered the last time. I prestiged pretty quicklyjust barely over the minimum and I didnt see really any difference in my tap amount. I expected it to be small but not basically none. My prestige bonus starting off that run was .something aa and I gained  aa in the run. I prestiged and my total bonus was .something aa again. It might have been even lower than it was. Not sure how that works. My understanding is theres an incremental increase each time you prestige. If its just a flat total of what you just prestiged I dont understand how people are gaining so much by prestiging so quickly. I thought the benefit of quickly prestiging was to gain higher bonuses that allow to you prestige more quickly at the risk of not adding soldiers. Am I totally wrong? ,taptycoon,cyqlmcc,1,t5_3b81u

6594692,0,t1_d016ahs,The increase in soldiers is purely because the players nearer the bottom of the country have not all been on since the war ended. The same thing happened last week. It will go back down eventually.,taptycoon,d01g1gh,1,t5_3b81u

8429266,0,t1_d5tk98g,Heres my spreadsheet so farI added a line for current max net worth as that seems to have a significant role as well.  I was able to maintain roughly the same bonus increase for nearly  consecutive prestiges at about the same max net worth note that not all of these are listed but once I nearly quadrupled this amount with a boosted investment bonus the prestige bonus less than doubled.  Therefore it seems to factor heavily on the max net worth.  It doesnt just factor on this though as I tested to see what it would take to get a . ad bonus and it took about  au the first time and about  au the second.  Ill continue to see how long it takes to get to . ad for a while to see if I can get some better data though my numbers might get thrown off a bit if the timing gets thrown off to where I cannot prestige right at . au e.g. if Im sleeping or otherwise occupied at the time.  My current conclusion though is that max net worth seems to have a larger impact than total profit.  That would add more credence to the prestige ASAP theory as diminishing returns seem to have a larger impact the longer you go past the minimum prestige level.,taptycoon,d5v76oh,2,t5_3b81u

8523085,0,t1_d66xnt1,Lets just use E as an example.The  is actually your wealth index aka your level. That is the number at the top of the main screen above the bar that fills up as you progress.So when you reach level  aka E and you want to prestige you will earn  TC after doing so.,taptycoon,d66y45m,2,t5_3b81u
8550080,0,t3_4wtle6,For your first Prestige I would say aim for when you get the first few Tech Cards It will show as  Tech Cards in the prestige window.You arent guaranteed anything good from them but it will give you a decent multiplier from the prestige bonus but also the chance for some additional multipliers to speed things up further.This loosely corresponds to the first prestige should be at  multiplier depending on how fast you get that first jump so that your next run is at least twice as fast to get to the same point.  There is little gain in stretching it out too far since it will be easier the next time around but a solid starting point will make it feel faster from the start.,taptycoon,d6abyvj,2,t5_3b81u
