167414,0,t1_cexholy,Haha! Im glad you seem to be just as in love with it as I am. For some reason my best friend hates it so much. I guess its just overly sweet to her? I dont know. But Im undeniably obsessed with it and would buy a love spell knockoff shave soap in a heartbeat.,ladyshavers,cexi2ra,1,t5_2zpzg
686570,0,t1_cgib79f,Wow I would never sell it.  Theyre so gorgeous.,ladyshavers,cgibbvp,2,t5_2zpzg
722008,0,t1_cgm4jk8,Wow that sounds yummy.,ladyshavers,cgmcggb,2,t5_2zpzg
892904,0,t3_24barj,I feel this way all the time! Whenever Im having a rough or stressful day I hurry home to shave. Even if Ive already shaved that day. I have Thursdays and Saturdays off and I dont do any home work or studying or anything until I have a nice hot shower and a loooong shave. It would be even better if I had a bathtub to soak in first.,ladyshavers,ch5rzwd,1,t5_2zpzg

1184550,0,t3_27ohhc,Ive been working on our FAQ and its  done. I plan on having it up in a few days or so. Sorry theres just a lot of content! Ill make a post once its up and will sticky it to the top of the page.,ladyshavers,ci2vpyl,5,t5_2zpzg
1219494,0,t1_ci6qke8,It helps slough off dead skin basically theres a lot more to it than that but I am not the person to explain it. Its also generally less irritating than physical exfoliation.BHAs like salicylic acid and AHAs are the main chemical exfoliants used and they also have humectant properties though not as much as glycerin.,ladyshavers,ci6t7xb,1,t5_2zpzg
1436945,0,t1_ciweb1w,Thats for the best..Sorry for previous comments I am not familiar with SE razors. ,ladyshavers,ciwebln,2,t5_2zpzg

2506559,0,t3_2o8hci,Definitely try out preshave oils and ditch any foam spray. after you shave use some stridex pads on your legs for bumps and ingrown hairs. use a new blade every time consider getting a double edged razor,ladyshavers,cmlquw7,1,t5_2zpzg
2539233,0,t1_cmq0885,Im not sure. But Im sure thats something that Casie kcbeemo tested while they were developing it. You should PM her and ask. Then let the rest of us know P of course I may buy this razor for research.....,ladyshavers,cmq0idd,2,t5_2zpzg
3377966,0,t1_cpd5ghm,I know what you mean I bought the Lady Gillette while waiting for the MRC to come back in stock and I was tempted to get the MRP too since that is also back in stock!,ladyshavers,cpdbamy,1,t5_2zpzg
3675704,0,t3_31hpl8,A little late but like RaggedClaws said Cremo which I like quite a bit and also Kiss My Face.  Like you I dont have the time or inclination to lather in the shower where I do most of my shaving and dont find my shave is better with latherbrush than not.,ladyshavers,cqb95vg,1,t5_2zpzg
4026696,0,t1_creyaw3,Im pretty sure that the skin discoloration has nothing to do with your shaving. I just tried googling it and there are some sites that give causes and solutions for it. Id provide some links but Im on mobile. ,ladyshavers,crf9uc8,2,t5_2zpzg
4991691,0,t3_3jaqha,I have never bought an artisan candle before. Wow. I usually get the Yankee candles on sale or whatever candle smells great at RossTJMaxx. I also sometimes get them on clearance at Target. Bath and Body Works is amazing for candles as well. Just make sure you buy during a sale if you can I too would love to know about artisan candles though. A good place to check might be your local farmers markets at well!,ladyshavers,cunony8,3,t5_2zpzg
5002691,0,t1_cup0bwg,Thank you!  Its a really good smelling soap! The performance is top notch too! ,ladyshavers,cup0g28,1,t5_2zpzg
5279106,0,t1_cvmds7t,That one did sound nice and would go well with her lotion.  Thank you!,ladyshavers,cvmgtdc,1,t5_2zpzg
5612352,0,t3_3rz8v7,I converted about  months ago. Disposable razors irritated my legs and I was tired of having red bumps. I purchased a beginner shaving kid from Maggards Razors and didnt even consider going back.Having fine hair I only have to go over my legs once instead of the two times I did with disposables. The shaves are smooooth and leave my legs softer especially when I exfoliate and wash with glycerin soap beforehand softens up the hair and follicles. I have no red bumps anymore.But I do end up spending about the same amount of time shaving my legs with my safety razor as I would a disposable. That is because I lather my own soap. The soap goes a long way in comparison to canned shaving cream though. Shaving for  months and Im not even halfway through albeit my fine hairs make it so I dont feel t he need to shave as often as others might.  The razors blades themselves havent been a problem. Im still trying out different brands to see which one I prefer. I change the blade out once every  shaves. ,ladyshavers,cwsrlj1,3,t5_2zpzg
5878038,0,t3_3vqlf3,Just raising the question of whats out there is a good start. Gauging where the community is located around the world for the sake of shipping for items.Blade types mild or harsh?The razors themselves long handle slant or compactSkin care combination coconut oil moisturizer alum blocksSoaps! Puck cream or bar pros and cons.This is just a few I thought of now and hopefully this helps ,ladyshavers,cxq55dk,2,t5_2zpzg
5969859,0,t3_3x405s,Shaving your face is actually supposed to be a really good way of exfoliating it and can make it a lot smoother of a base for putting on makeup if you wear any. I shave mine once a week all over just for the exfoliation since chemical exfoliants alone didnt seem to be doing the trick and Ive been loving it. I dont have noticeable facial hair so I dont know if stubble is an issue or not for people who do but its not a problem for me.,ladyshavers,cy26h4a,2,t5_2zpzg
6275272,0,t3_41f708,rwickededge will be a good place to start. Step  is to get a DE safety razor instead of spending the ridiculous amount on Gillette refills. The shave is also a lot nicer. ,ladyshavers,cz2xemf,5,t5_2zpzg
6441969,0,t1_czl4etx,Also you might be allergic to something in the shave gel.  rskincareaddiction  might be able to advise you.,ladyshavers,czln0b5,1,t5_2zpzg
6588129,0,t1_d00hbpu,Its only on a bad day that its very obvious. But I definitely prefer the tub because of that. I definitely agree with you on the hair thing my bath is generally over after I shave.,ladyshavers,d00rllg,1,t5_2zpzg
6690334,0,t3_479j0h,I go like... shaves with a blade. I dont know how it would fair in the shower as I shave outside of it now. I much prefer the sink now that I wet shave.,ladyshavers,d0bc80i,3,t5_2zpzg
6872784,0,t1_d0vbxsu,Great thanks so much!,ladyshavers,d0vcbwr,1,t5_2zpzg
7643378,0,t1_d3azc4r,I use witch hazel and then once that dries I use whatever lotion I have. I usually like to pick up random body butters from etsy to try,ladyshavers,d3b0e7x,2,t5_2zpzg
8815136,0,t1_d77chg2,Yeah for similar reasons my plan is that when she says Can I shave?  My friends are doing it. The answer is yes.  Its entirely a social construct the whole point is to fit in with peers at any age.  And yeah armpit hair?  The moment I see one Im gonna ask her if she wants to shave it.  If youre old enough to grow it youre old enough to shave it.  My Mom made me wait until I was  to shave my legs.  But she never really had leg hair and Ive always been hairier than my dad.  No good.,ladyshavers,d77gjum,6,t5_2zpzg
9075539,0,t3_54kxae,What have been some great DIY body scrubs that can help exfoliate the skin and help lessen the chance of ingrown hairs on legs? How often should one expoliate legs in between shaves?  Please and thank you ,ladyshavers,d82qdsh,1,t5_2zpzg
9173004,0,t1_d8d0yv4,I totally understand. I actually bought a Turkish bath cloth that was cheaper but it fell apart really fast and wasnt as good at exfoliating.,ladyshavers,d8eqvfe,1,t5_2zpzg
9898707,0,t1_daxrs8e,Its a sharps box! And brilliant I wish I had thought of it before. Much better than tossing the tiny razors in the trash. So many ways that could end up really hurting someone especially if you live in a semiurban area where people look through trash.,ladyshavers,daxtp6l,7,t5_2zpzg
11566903,0,t3_652w9g,For your first question I dont have the same condition but I do itchy like a mother fucking mad woman for hours after shaving and am in pain regularly as the hair grows back. DE has improved the issue but not completely removed either of them. To do that I have to wax or use my epilator. For your second Ive cut my skin tag but have never sliced it off. It hurts less when I cut it with the DE because with mine the head of the razor stops at the tag and I notice where my hand is at. With disposables they were so thin Id hit it and keep going making the damage larger. ,ladyshavers,dg743wq,3,t5_2zpzg
