With time and effort I promise you will be able to cut those things out if only to see how much better you can possibly feel. You can do it! Another tip motivation is a great foot through the door but dont rely on it if you want to keep going long term. There WILL be a point where you dont feel like working out or eating the healthier options and thats where a sense of discipline needs to come into motion. That voice in your head that says I dont want to do this but Im going to do it anyways. That in itself is a skill to develop but again with patience and persistence you can do it and making the big changes depends on it.Just some food for thought! Other than that just keep rocking it. I would not be here writing to you if it didnt work for me but you have to work for it first. You got this shit!,Blogilates,dbyz5dq,5,t5_388bm
