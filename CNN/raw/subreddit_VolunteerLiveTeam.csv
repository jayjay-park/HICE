10151475,0,t1_dbupp14,I may be mistaken but Ive just read that on the BBC app and I think when they say the killer shouted the murder was in revenge for Russian involvement in the conflict in the Syrian city of Aleppo. they are referencing the assassination of the Russian ambassador who was killed in Ankara. ,VolunteerLiveTeam,dbuq4ht,4,t5_3fsf0
