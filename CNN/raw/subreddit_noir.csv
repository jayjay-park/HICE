6883148,0,t3_4a12oa,Anything by China Miville especially King Rat Perido Street Station and The City and The City.  King Rat blends noir with fantasy retelling of the Pied Piper.  Perido Street Station is noir meets high fantasy.  The City and The City is a crazy metaphysically mind fuck i.e. a blend of Chandler and Kafka.Great stuff.  Must read.,noir,d0wirdk,3,t5_2smt1
6967086,0,t3_4b44sz,I need to watch more classic Noir before I have a definitive favorite otherwise I would have to pick Cassablanca simply because of my lack of experience.Neo Noir hands down my favorite so far is Sin City particularly the Marv arc.Edit Would never have forgiven myself if I did not mention Leon The Professional. I love that movie so much.,noir,d161zrc,3,t5_2smt1

8070814,0,t3_45fsqe,I think Philip Marlowe glass keys his way into the house when he hears gunshots from outside in The Big Sleep. I think Raymond Chandler said glass key or some other cool way of saying to break the glass. ,noir,d4n8ibi,1,t5_2smt1

11572409,0,t3_6560xt,It may not fully fit into the noir label but i really like Bukowskis Pulp. Its a detective novel unlike his previous pseudoautobiographic books. It may not have much heavier shadows but its filled with great quotesand really just sucks you in. Bukowskis characteristical style of writing mixed with a detective story gives an orginal unique experience. Definitely worth recommendig  easily one of my favourite books.,noir,dg7qlk8,3,t5_2smt1
