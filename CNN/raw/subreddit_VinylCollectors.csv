4710648,1,t1_cto9yfg,Thanks   Glad someone on the internet thinks so. You obviously dont understand the concept of personal value. A material item is only worth as much as the price you put on it I valued the market good at  hence why I didnt buy it on release. Thats why you buy some things and not others. Its what creates supply and demand and price points.

4924209,0,t3_3icmyv,Im not sure what resources youre using but these two pages will be pretty much the best things you can use to value any record. The first is a site called Discogs that shows that there are  different versions of that record. Start with finding the catalog number its usually somewhere in the corner of the back or definitely somewhere on the spine of the record. Use Discogs for looking up pressings of any other record of interest to you. Second is a site called Popsike. It tracks vinyl record sales across a myriad of auction sites. It doesnt usually track the lower end of the collectors market but is definitely valuable when looking for a general price for a record on the current market. Dont forget to click the Date button after searching so you get the earliest date from when you do it since the collectible record market fluctuates quite a bit. Use Popsike after you have determined exactly which pressing you own on Discogs since this can make or break your records value. But the collector in me will always try to draw you to our side. Records are a fun and very affordable thing to do if you stick to used classics like the great collection it sounds like you inherited. If its something good and you think youre gonna enjoy playing them then hold onto them until you find a cheap turntable and give them a listen before you decide to sell them. And when the Stones hit you in the solar plexus with the onetwo punch of th Nervous Breakdown on Big Hits you might be holding on to them! Lets us know how it goes.EDITFixed Link,VinylCollectors,cuf8hcf,4,t5_2s0ub

This place is JAM PACKED with vinyl as well as old gaming consoles and games action figures frog themed younameits as well as CDs DVDs etc. and can be really tough to navigate.  Crates upon crates upon shelves upon drawers upon crates upon shelves.  With more shelves and crates.  And then more...and more...  Bob is an eccentric fellow but gives great recommendations and the staff is always quick to help.  They are always polite a little crazy and super helpful.  Some stuff can be difficult to find but if you ask they are more than happy to help you find it its a weird layout.  I have Never received bad or poor customer service or advice.  The reviews online are ridiculous.  Yes the place is overloaded with stuff but I have NEVER seen any staff member be unfriendly to anyone.  I will always recommend Krazy Bobs as they have the best selection around and the nicest staff.  If you can spare a whole day GO!  It will take you all day just to get through one section!
