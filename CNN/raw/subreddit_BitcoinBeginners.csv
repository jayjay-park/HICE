The reasoning is subtle  as BitCoin prices rise people have the incentive to transact in smaller and smaller denominations  these smaller transactions are subject to greater and greater transaction fees  the drag of these transaction fees slows the velocity of the network and thus devalues BitCoin vs. traditional transactional clearing or more likely an alternative emergent currency.Im superduper interested to see how this plays out.,BitcoinBeginners,cf1wli2,1,t5_2wju0

424209,0,t3_1yvltc,gt Am I right so far?Yes  if you by encrypt the database mean encrypt the wallet...gt The encryption and private key are separate things correct?Yes separate. You have private keys long numbers in your wallet more or less data in a file  BitcoinQt encrypts this file with the password you give to it so the private keys are not visible amp usable without the password. However the password is for the one wallet file you use it for. gt all I need to save with the Private Key being the very important one?Yes.gt Also I have read stuff about Decay and things of that nature. Do I have to replace this offline wallet often?If you have it on CD  USB stick  then yes probably every year or two.I recommend to look into Electrum  it is already available in Debian repositories. It is so called deterministic wallet  so you can generate all future addresses that are and will be in your wallet  just from a single thing called seed which is sequence of  words. Electrum seed is in fact a secure paper wallet.All you need to do is to generate the Electrum wallet on offline computer booted from Live CD amp disconnected from networks write down the seed on multiple papers to be stored on multiple places and some of the addresses  and you are set. Do not forget to shred your Electrum wallet.dat file so the only way how to use your bitcoins is to use the seed to recreate the wallet. There is also a way how you can send bitcoins with Electrum from offline computer . you create unsigned transaction on online computer in Electrumseedlesswallet. you take it to offline computer via USB disk.  on offline computer you sign it in your Electrum wallet which has the seed i.e. all the private keys . you take the signed transaction back to online computer using USB disk . you broadcast the transaction into Bitcoin network ...in this way you can be sending bitcoins securely from your savings addresses which you have in your wallet which is recoverable from the seed the change goes to new change address which is also recoverable from your seed.,BitcoinBeginners,cfoqful,2,t5_2wju0

452952,0,t3_1z9lfz,There are two ways to move funds out of a paper wallet.  Import the private key into your wallet software or web wallet. This copies the private key itself into the wallet. The key becomes part of the wallet. There is no transaction..  Sweep the funds into your web wallet or software. The private key never ends up being managed by the wallet. Instead a transaction is made that moves funds from the paper wallet into one of your wallets existing addresses.Both approaches transfer all funds out of the paper wallet unless your software supports something different and you use that.Unless you have a very good reason for doing aotherwise always sweep never import. It may take you an additional  minutes  confirmation before spending and may cost you a transaction fee but its well worth it. There are known exploits that you can fall victim to if your paper wallet private key has ever been seen by another party and you import itBefore doing any of this though you should understand change addressesEdit having said all of this you need to weight the difficultycomplexity of doing the right thing securitywise with the possibility that youll make a mistake from lack of experience.

1398948,0,t1_cirjuln,So the entropy necessary is a hard thing to answer. It really depends on which attacker youre facing under what circumstances.For example Facebook has rate limits. So they allow you to login  times then ask for a captcha... after  times theyll say return in  hours. So youll only be able to do about  tries every day or lets say k tries per year.That means that if you have a pincode of just  numbers  to  you get    million different combinations. So a random pincode would be found on average after  of all codes have been tried so after  years someone could break your facebook pincode. Remember  million sequences is just  bits of entropy very little yet more than safe enough as nobody will enter  pincodes a day for  years to enter your facebook.However say someone downloaded the facebook database from their servers. Now they could try pincodes without having to have permission from facebook to enter a password. A typical computer could try a million pincodes per minute easily. So now the facebook account can be cracked within seconds.So entropy is very subjective to the circumstances. The blockchain is like this public database anyone can access so theres no such thing as rate limitation. People can download it and try to crack private keys as much as they want so you need a lot more entropy.How much again is hard to say. A bit from wikigtEntropy as a measure of password strengtheditIt is usual in the computer industry to specify password strength in terms of information entropy measured in bits a concept from information theory. Instead of the number of guesses needed to find the password with certainty the base logarithm of that number is given which is the number of entropy bits in a password. A password with say  bits of strength calculated in this way would be as strong as a string of  bits chosen randomly say by a fair coin toss. Put another way a password with  bits of strength would require  attempts to exhaust all possibilities during a brute force search. Thus adding one bit of entropy to a password doubles the number of guesses required which makes an attackers task twice as difficult. On average an attacker will have to try half of the possible passwords before finding the correct one.So imagine we had a computer that could try out  billion passwords every second. Now imagine you have  billion of such computers. Thats  billion billion passwords per second right.Now take a  bit number. Thats  possible passwords. If random e.g. flipping  coins then we expect on average after checking  of all possible passwords  that we find the correct password.So lets take  and divide by  billion and then divide by smh days. Thats  thousand years. So obviously none of us will be alive in  thousand years and obviously we dont have a billion computers that could check a billion passwords per second. In fact the entire hashing power of the bitcoin mining network which generates half a billion dollars in value per year is about  million billion hashes so only a fraction of the above computational power in my example and that already costs hundreds of millions of dollars annually to run. So to run something x larger for  thousand years... well thats what you need to break a bit number.A  bit number is many many many orders of magnitude more secure. So given the above example of  billion passwords per second tried on  billion of such computers it would take  times the entire age of our universe  billion years to break a  bit random password. this is also why even a quantum computer that could be a trillion times faster than our modern computer it would get nowhere close to threatening bit numbers bitcoin usesRemember that a  bit number is about x more secure than a  bit number. A  bit number is a million times more secure than a  bit. So if breaking a  bit number takes an hour breaking a  bit number takes a million hours for example. If breaking a  bit number takes a century then breaking a  bit number takes  centuries. Anyway enough examples. Anyway so for me  bits of entropy for a blockchain private key is plenty. And for my banking app on my phone a digit password . possible keys is also plenty because of rate limitation. ,BitcoinBeginners,cirn06x,2,t5_2wju0

Clean spyware off your computer Download something from the net Type in your password Clean spyware off your computer again.If someone followed this list they could have their computer infected at the time they do the keystrokes on their keyboard. Step two is where the possible infection happens. The correct order is as follows. Download something from the net Clean spyware off your computer Type in your password DoneThis way if someone did have a virus they got from the net they would wipe it AFTER they disconnect from the net.Seriously dude. For someone giving advice such as lock yourself in your room and use dice instead of a computer generated random number you are being woefully dangerous in your advice against the absolutely most common problem there is.EDIT Maybe this would be a clearer example. Let me go back to the make sure nobody is looking over your shoulder as you type your password metaphor. Say I wrote a guide that told people to make sure nobody else was in their house go fetch something from outside then lock their door. Would that be sure nobody would be looking over their shoulder? Obviously not. The correct order is to lock your door first then check to make sure nobody else is in your house then type in your password.

Itll be a little bit slow to confirm blocks for the next couple of weeks since the speed there depends on how much mining power there is and a continent just got shut down it gets reset every  weeks though so that issue will resolve itself quickly without any intervention.As for coins that you have they dont do anything.  You cant easily send them but your address can still receive as long as the Bitcoin network is still active and the person sending them can get a message to the network.  If you really wanted to send a transaction then you would have to get about a notecards worth of data sent to a computer somewhere that has access to the network.  Any means of doing this is just fineradios physical letters even carrier pigeons if theyve got the endurance.Once power comes back and the internet connection is reestablished it would be a simple matter for all of the Bitcoin nodes in the US to pop back up again.  Nodes go offline and come back all the time in the network with no issue.If power went out all over the world then the network would pretty much pause.  With no nodes talking to each other and no hashing being done by miners the blockchain would not progress.  As the nodes started coming back online they would need to establish communication with each other.  If a traditional internet connection is not available between two regions then they could be patched together using radio signals although I dont think anyone has actually worked out an implementation of this.  Once the majority of the worlds active nodes are all in a network together as opposed to several disjoint networks and a significant number of miners go back to work you could see the network return to relative normalcy.Note that in all of these cases your coins are safe in that they will stay associated with your address.  As long as power and internet or something like it come back and at least one copy of the blockchain survives your coins will not leave your address except with a valid signature from you or someone who learns your private key. ,BitcoinBeginners,cjwa3xl,1,t5_2wju0

However the used address are still valid which means if someone sends you another payment on the same address youll receive it of course.  You should always use fresh addresses if you can.   The best security options are devices which store your private addresses offline such as the Ledger Wallet or the Trezor    The advantage of storing BTC on a physical slip of paper is that the address stays offline and therefore your Bitcoins cant be stolen that easily vs. if your computer is hacked.    However in order to generate a really secure paper wallet you actually save the private key on a paper the address should be generated on an offline computer which shouldnt connect to the Intenet anymore.    For bigger amounts Id recommend using the Trezor since it generates all addresses  offline.    Please ask if you have more questions! ,BitcoinBeginners,ct1owli,2,t5_2wju0

6296804,0,t3_41pwej,A few things. Nodes have hard coded checkpoints that get inserted periodically. No amount of blocks however difficult they may be may overwrite these blocks and in turn the blocks that came before them. The checkpoints are far enough back that theyre not going to affect current chain growth but recent enough that theyre too difficult for an individual to mess with.. Nodes check a chains total difficulty not just the number of blocks. Your chain wouldnt be sufficient just by being long.. To get a longer chain youd wind up either having to push the time stamps into the future or run the difficulty up to impossible values. The difficulty targets  minute blocks but it has historically produced blocks faster than that which is why the difficulty rises. Youd have to produce more blocks with a shorter time span on the timestamps which means that the difficulty has to rise faster relative to the timestamps than it did in the real blockchain. This is in addition to the fact that the network has a several year head start. Alternatively you could produce blocks with timestamps far in the future to keep the difficulty low but these would be immediately rejected due to their timestamps. ,BitcoinBeginners,cz5dir0,1,t5_2wju0

8138443,0,t3_4qpeke,I guess by wallet ID you mean receiving address?Its best to consider addresses as singleuse for several reasons the main being privacy but as youve found there are some use cases where thats difficult.Most HD wallets like Mycelium will show a new address as soon as the previous one has received funds. But that doesnt mean the address becomes inactive in any way. Its still in your wallet and you can keep receiving funds to it. Its just a presentationUI thing really.

While they do provide a reputable service there are lots of alternatives around. Some of these may not have such an intense verification process.  Keep in mind that buying bitcoin with a credit card is usually the best way for beginners as its easy instant and trustworthy in most cases but that depositing on an exchange with a bank transfer can be much cheaper. This might be a consideration if you are looking to buy large quantities. Other wise credit  debit card is fine.As others have mentioned here localbitcoins is a great place to buy btc without verification of ID. Its actually really good if you want to buy anonymously. If youre just looking to avoid the lenghy verification process then take some time to research the range of beginnerfriendly bitcoin trading sites for buying with a card or bank transfer indicated where applicable too. I would also recommend the option of buying using a bitcoin ATM. There should be one nearby if you live close to a major city. Theres a map with all locations on coinATMradar. Some machines require no ID verification to buy bitcoin others may force you to go through these steps. A good alternative nevertheless,BitcoinBeginners,daqh7jx,3,t5_2wju0

If you use Tails you dont even have to actively delete anything because Tails doesnt permanently store anything except if you explicitly tell it to.If you permanently install Electrum on a machine youre going to have the wallet file. Make sure to use a very strong password for that. See  how to create strong and memorable passwords.Still if anything happens like the machine getting destroyed you accidentally deleting the walletfile ransomeware encrypting it and so on you can always recreate everything from that seed youve got in your head or a piece of paper or in a mathematical superposition of  physical locations.,BitcoinBeginners,dc0gwnf,2,t5_2wju0

10250136,0,t1_dc5vl5d,Bitfinex used a retarded set up. First of all it wasnt useful for the users at all because they controlled  of the multisig keys. Second BitGo was set to automatically sign every transaction presented by Bitfinex. So when the hack happened the hacker could happily withdraw because BitGo automatically cosigned everything. This is just my assumption because they never disclosed or even found out? how the hack happened. But it could have happened like this with their setup.When you use a multisig service as a user you should always make sure you have enough pieces to get access to the coins yourself and the service doesnt. With BitGo of you have  keys and BitGo has one. The idea is that in normal use you use your main key and BitGo sign with their key only if you verify your FA. If you need your keys and BitGo is gone you can use your backup key. If you lose your main key you can use your backup key with BitGo.gt Having a hardware wallet wipe my data because of  entry failures sounds harsh. Especially if it is my heirs who are trying to use the device. None of them are especially technically fluent. Id hate to think that the coins would be erased because they entered in a  instead of an O.You shouldnt think of the hardware wallet as the holder of the keys. The paper backup is the holder of the keys. If you enter the pin wrong  times it just means you have to enter the seed words from paper again.gt Number  sounds like a viable option but can you expand a little? I made a paper wallet but is that what you mean by an encrypted paper wallet? Just the private key?gt Are you suggesting that I split the private key into chunks that are each stored in a different place? So you would need to access them all in order to build the key andor passphrase?No Im suggesting you use a BIP encrypted private key. They start with a . You can create one with bitaddress.org for example if you check the BIP Encrypt? box and enter a passphrase before clicking Generate on the Paper Wallet tab. Make sure you do this on an offline machine.If you want to split the private key itself you should use Shamirs Secret Sharing. I wrote a tool for that that I used for a while as my cold storage but Ive since moved to multisig and a hardware wallet.

But not take anything out.  This number is the public key.Now you also have a key which opens the box and lets you take the money out and do with it whatever you want.

Have an explanation if she ever finds your transaction history on the first wallet. Oh that ? I sent that to a bitcoin doubler and got nothing back. Im stupid. EmployerExchangeIf your employer is paying you in Bitcoins your transaction history will start to become transparent to them. Exchanges can also keep track of what happens to coins you withdraw. They will be able to see how much you spend and save and get some idea where you are spending your money. The easiest way to protect against this is to send all your bitcoins to a gambling site or exchange then withdraw them again. Slightly more effective is converting them into a more anonymous cryptocurrency like ZCash and back to Bitcoin. This breaks the simplest trails. .
