1424951,0,t3_2afk2h,Me and two other people I ride with switched from Dakine to Mystic a few years back. Holy cow they are like the Herman Miller of windsurfing harnesses  think super comfortable and solid construction. The harnesses stay where they should and the padding feels great on the lower back. We have the Mystic Warrior II male and female versions.,windsurfing,ciuw8af,2,t5_2s5ga

2257002,0,t1_clqh6uz,gt  poundsOk so youre are a stone heavier than me and a beginner really. I think the bottom line is that you have to decide how many boards you will get. Ideally you want several so have a board for all conditions. But if you are only going to have  board the choices are  do you want the board to be good in light winds only but will still get out on a windy day even though it might be a handfull .  do you want the board to be good in stronger winds only and to be sat on the beach hoping the wind picks up more if its too light?Personally Id advise getting a nd hand l freeride board. This will plane in more conditions and you will have more fun more often. Yes when the wind picks up it will be hard work but you can still use it and you will learn a lot from struggling in strong winds with a bigger board. I wish I had a board this size but my biggest is l. Id say if you had a second hand l board then later you could also go for a l board for when the wind picks up.,windsurfing,clqoq5v,2,t5_2s5ga

10632660,0,t1_ddccjce,Thanks for your comment. Inflatables are getting impressive now for SUP boards and seem to be following well for windsurfing. My  Red Paddle Ride  rides better then alot of hard boards Ive used. Im hoping this board works well for my lower weight  at . I want to get into the intermediate level on my first board as I learn off the Georgia coast where I live. Research on windsurfing boards is harder then sup though for sure so I appreciate your help!,windsurfing,ddcof8g,1,t5_2s5ga
