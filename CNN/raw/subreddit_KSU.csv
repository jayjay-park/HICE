5827836,0,t1_cxj8jjg,Is this a relatively new thing? Because I polled the folks in my office and they universally said theyd gone to weekend graduation ceremonies including a UGA grad.UGAs commencement is at least scheduled for Friday  December.Georgia Tech and Georgia Southerns commencements are scheduled for Friday  December.Georgia State is scheduled for a Wednesday and Thursday so I guess theres a tiering of institutions.  If your football team is older than  years old youre relegated to a weekday commencement.  Perhaps thats why KSU went for a football team and raised my fees so much.  It all makes sense now! . . . or maybe not.,KSU,cxjjzhs,1,t5_2s3yt
6146578,0,t3_3zpvkh,She absolutely has time to register. Final registration goes through tomorrow. Even if the hold isnt gone by then she can sign up first thing on Monday and not miss a day of class. Not Anymore is pretty stupid but they inundate you with emails about it until you complete it. This will at least make sure that her email is up and running. You cant get by at KSU without checking your email. ,KSU,cyoauyi,1,t5_2s3yt

7334214,0,t3_4ctjcg,KSU has a lot more comp sci options than tech but you are looking in the wrong place. Where tech may have  or  concentrations in comp sci KSU has graphic design as a major software engineering with  different concentrations computer systems engineering with concentrations graphic design with concentrations and Information Security. You need to look around more. Ive been to both schools and if you want to do design you arent going to get paid unless you go to tech anyway. If you want to go into IT or CS youre better off going to KSU and working an IT CS job as soon as possible. Your experience in our field carries FAR more weight than your degree. You can always get a masters from tech but I would never recommend Tech for this field unless you can commit to internships and Coops along with the workload. If you can then it would be good for you. The stress is definitely tangible.,KSU,d2buljc,1,t5_2s3yt
