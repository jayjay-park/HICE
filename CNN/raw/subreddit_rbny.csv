3525165,0,t3_30nr0s, Sacha Absolute beast showed his technicality and that once he figures everything out like he did in the second half he will be the best midfielder in the league BWP Got the PK tucked away nicely and a strange assist but his movement and positioning was on point. Plus he had more key passes than our midfield combined Duvall Silly th minute challenge aside he is quite literally the man. Defensively solid and seems eager to showcase his attacking abilities. Key to our season and a big part of our future.Honorable Mentions Dax el capitano puts in another solid game. Grella HOLY SHOPPING CARTS. BRUH. BRUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Robles. I have no words. As a fellow keeper you had a game I could only dream of.LVP Least Valuable Player Wallace. I really dont like him. Maybe its because of my infatuation with Lade and I know hes stealing playing time from my baby but I just dont like him.Question of the Week Since we seem set on a  forward isnt really an option. Sure a proven striker who doesnt mind riding the bench for awhile would be nice but AbangGrella should hold us for the time being. Our midfield is stacked. I think we are good. Zizzo will pick up quickly. Defense is fine. Miazga is maturing Perrinelle is looking solid Zubar should perform when he returns Lawrence looked great Duvall is great. No real issues back there. If we have to bolster any position it would be a forward purely for depth.P.S. I legitamely teared up at the thought of Robles being injured when he hit that post.

4010060,0,t3_36e8x4,Youve recieved some good answers already but one thing to keep in mind I guess is that our first team is the priority. Everything else exists to benefit it.We have an academy that takes children and works with them until theyre in college and the U team that academy players and targets of interest play for while around college age so that they can retain NCAA amateur eligibility.We also have the REd Bulls II. This is a fully professional team with paid players. The idea here is to create a competitive environment that new players recently signed academy players and other targets for the first team can take advantage of to get minutes while acclimating to our system. Its a great option for players like Stolz to grow under until they feel hes ready for first team action while also giving him a shot.to make his case outside of practice.,rbny,crddlnv,3,t5_2tftg

9792285,0,t1_dajiewg,Perrinelle seems like a reasonable backup to me at k even if he may be past his  form. He played pretty well when called on this season. Baah Id bet will be the starter next year when healthy big question mark thereBiggest question is whether Collins even coming back isnt he out of contract?,rbny,dak412z,1,t5_2tftg
