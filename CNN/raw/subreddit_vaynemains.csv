7317842,0,t3_4fbnve,Id say that HP did more for you than the slow itself tbh. You can get about the same defensive stats and similar offense in steraks for  gold less only giving up the slow passive which isnt very useful nowadays with everyone and their dog building swifties.,vaynemains,d29zm0f,1,t5_35l0c
7406711,0,t1_d279hxg,Thats not a bad idea! It does more damage anyways when it stuns.,vaynemains,d2k3f3j,1,t5_35l0c
7479619,0,t3_4hsnad,On the clip when you went in and started kitingyou always tumbled to the same way you could use it to the opposite way they are running learning attack move isreally nice if you can use it good it will be better than right clicking,vaynemains,d2se1yg,1,t5_35l0c
7567844,0,t3_4izhwd,Disclaimer Im SilverAs derpy as it sounds I really like bloodrazorrageblade combo for Vayne now. Bloodrazor is much cheaper then BorK as a st item and it scales against tanks pretty well. Rageblades passive is just super good with Silver Bolts. Then from there its kind of a toss up. I might pick up a BorK PD Hurricane BT Frozen Mallet Scimitar LDRMR and Steraks GageGA. If you try this take Warlords over Fervor and farm to Red SmitegtBloodrazor.,vaynemains,d32fdwa,0,t5_35l0c

8495138,0,t1_d63bwzo,I personally take ghostblade over BoTRK. Gives me the movespeed to chase while also letting me  shot squishies. With ulted passive  GB no one is getting away,vaynemains,d63fycz,1,t5_35l0c
8634948,0,t3_4xt0jd,i tried looking for one as well but with no luck.. maybe we should make one?,vaynemains,d6kz4yg,1,t5_35l0c
8646761,0,t3_4y5er5,If the buff comes in the next patch Q max will probably be mandatory. Atm I would like others said skill Q until ult and then max W. What others didnt say is that it helps you farming under tower aswell,vaynemains,d6mgg1z,1,t5_35l0c
8986227,0,t1_d7rzalw,Rushing Shiv is fine with W max but you will definitely lose lane if you try to trade without a sustain support against most duos. Your all ingank support will be fine. Once you complete it youre just looking to shove. If you like maxing Q get BFpick axe first for sure. Personally I always rush BotRK because you can take unfavorable trades and then heal up and your vv and gank set up via the slow on cutlassBotRK is much better. If youre just csing alone under turret and the enemy ad is also alone you can often solo them even despite any escapes because of the long lane. Your passive and the slow make you inescapable ,vaynemains,d7s08uf,1,t5_35l0c
9044744,0,t1_d7ysj4z,Exactly something like a PD BT Maw Scimitar etc. are all better as a rd item than triforce.,vaynemains,d7z17vy,1,t5_35l0c
9049780,0,t1_d7zlw1j,Youre pretty late to trying to jump on the lucian train but hes still good better for climbing soloq than vayne for sure regardless of multiple lucian nerfs and the recent vayne buff.,vaynemains,d7zn12p,1,t5_35l0c
9317475,0,t1_d8wy6wu,I wasnt even capitalizing it did it on its own man brand is too immobile karma can outroam him wave clear sustain at wraiths and provide speed for team... shit opish,vaynemains,d8x23qg,1,t5_35l0c
9511877,0,t3_5b3wvp,Dont worry about it.If you didnt script you wont be banned.Sadly there are a lot of people out there who give false scripting accusions Ive been accused of scripting as well some time ago but still not banned.,vaynemains,d9ljhdw,1,t5_35l0c

10588702,0,t1_dd84zia,when it comes to teamfighting and such just watch for the biggest threats and play like an assassin. Wait for the deadliest thing to be used and then go in. Sometimes you do get peel and those days are amazing. and most the the time you dont. It takes time to know your limits with Vayne. if you keep playing her youll get her eventually. so just keep at her.,vaynemains,dd8568k,1,t5_35l0c
11086885,0,t3_5yau77,Hmmm.. Its situational. Theyre both good it all depends on youWould you want more damage for  secs for dueling or more scaling life steal and speed for kiting and sustain?,vaynemains,deoost3,1,t5_35l0c
11257914,0,t1_df825zo,Well soulstealer is the only skin I use but otherwise I like Dragonslayer no chroma and arclight.,vaynemains,df82fzb,1,t5_35l0c

11506192,0,t3_646ks9,AA  Q AA  E gets the silver bolts off the fastest way possible. Other than that shes about positioning and attack speed so she can proc it more often. She really needs crits late game too so a IE and maybe  Zeal items or a bork instead if you need LS and attack speed is optimal,vaynemains,dg087is,1,t5_35l0c
11516553,0,t1_dg1e9b3,Yeah surely. Very impressive how Rekkles made Vayne work and straight up carried hard on it. ,vaynemains,dg1eie8,5,t5_35l0c
