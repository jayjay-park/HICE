7257370,0,t1_d21g0e5,Hey laMarmtte     I was working with your example and ran into this error     TypeError str object is not callableWhen I checked the help docs for MoviePy I noticed that you mainly use VideoFileClip instead of just VideoClip.  When I switched that line it worked.  When I rendered the final video my background video played first and then the masked video showed up. I realized this was due to the order of the clips in the CompositeVideoClip function so I switched those and then added in a fps setting for the final video.    import moviepy.editor as mpe    mask  mpe.VideoFileClipmyvid.mov hasmaskTrue.mask    video  mpe.VideoFileClipyourfirstvideo.mp    video  mpe.VideoFileClipyoursecondvideo.mp    finalvideo  mpe.CompositeVideoClipvideovideo.setmaskmask    finalvideo.writevideofilefinalvideo.mp fpsIve been working with MoviePy a lot recently and I love what youve created .,moviepy,d2340on,2,t5_318km
