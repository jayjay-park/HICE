Theres an OVA episode of the anime series that occurs after the events of the visual novel and there is also a movie that occurs after the events of the OVA. There is no English dub for the movie yet if thats important to you.

2914466,0,t1_cnyafw4,Thats how you know Ive remembered the meat of all Okabes statements. There is just something very memorable about everything he says. Perhaps that is because it is stated constantly and you never get a break from the truth. She dies over and over and he never stops suffering. His emotion is constantly emitting from every single scene. Id like to think Lukas Ending shows just how alone he is. You can have your favorite assistant and she can continue to help you through this but you need to remember that hes controlling time through subjectivity. He is fighting through the existence outside the confines of cause and effect. Disconnection from causality makes him alone.Exactly. All it would take to understand that desired ending is a quick read of Distant ValhallaWhile I did not read it I know what its about. We all should from the visual novels interpretation. However I did say notable changes would occur. In this instance he would not have found his assistant or rather it would go very differently. Kurisu would retain the memories of Okabe letting Mayuri die thus hating him and never talking to him. This is the twist I talked about. Wed have an altered form of Distant Valhalla. One that many fans would not be up for. You know with the whole Okabe x Kurisu thing. That would be nonexistent. It would be nice to get refreshing material but thats not looking possible right now.I think I should probably view the movie just for context. The Variable states This occurs after the events of Burdened Domain of Dj vu so it helps to have seen that or know the context.Id say its deep but we can only go so far. The literary elements are in place. That Antithesis explains exactly how it is. Its exactly how I felt going through SteinsGate. Most people felt differently. It was just a time travel story with consequences to them.That is pretty much a sum of the series. My beforethoughts and afterthoughts are plagued with depressing themes. The beginning was quite possibly one of the most sound and certain beginnings Ive experienced. I explained before about its comfy factor. It just optimistic plot the entire way. Though with all that optimism breeds a certain form of nostalgic depression. So if its not related to SteinsGate then what is it?Right. So the OVA might be referenced throughout the movie but the Light Novel will be explained to no extent. No spoilers. Ill probably end up watching the Movie and the OVA Saturday or SundayFinally finished a  question chain quiz for my IS  class. The light novel in my mind is yet another prerequisite to the movie. Its something nice to have on hand. It might even make the experience that much more enjoyable. This is why I feel it is required to be translated. Youre essentially gating off prerequisites. Youre preventing a better understanding if that so becomes the case. The series probably isnt dead. Theres just a long length of time until well see any announcements. Where the hell do they even announce new content? Conventions? Is it just said outright through social media?Its troublesome to think the dream team is losing its touch. That has been on my mind along with the make believe departure of several key elements of SteinsGate. What if they arent working together on another SteinsGate? What does this mean for the series? I know pb. houses the original writer Naotaka Hayashi and Rintar Okabe. This means the potential to make more content is there. However what of Nitro? Their relevancy died out after the English release of SteinsGate for PC. There involvement was next to nothing in the SteinsGate series yet they are shown to have done something. Unfortunately the internet does not have that information. As you said its best not to worry and rather look forward to new content. If its quality its fine with me.Yeah. If anything this is a very simplified card game. There are only like four rules. Everything else is psychological tuning.Thats why the pairing of visual novel elements to that of the DramaCDs is so enjoyable to me. The DramaCDs on their own are nice but Im more immersed in visual novel feeling than just the plain sound. Everything feels disconnected if it isnt reinforced by a visual representation. It feels like home but it definitely feels too nostalgic for me. Playing through even the beginning would have me on my knees in tears. I have the urge to play the novel again and again just to keep experiencing it but I know what will happen. Its at this point that I think I have recovered a great deal from my traumatic adventure into SteinsGate. It wont last long. Ive got the movie to watch!Right? I need all the collectibles. In just a week Ill have my Darling copy and another still figure to add to my collection! Yes the Lie Detector comes from the Xbox  Limited Edition of the visual novel. The miniature Time Machine comes from Darling. Its very odd how they have them reversed but thats how it is. Oh? So has college started up again?Apparently some people are capable of saying they experienced a well nights rest and felt satisfied upon waking up. That feeling is unknown to me. It shouldnt be give my current circumstances. College work has basically forced me to relinquish my thoughts on SteinsGate. Its just been questions after questions and work after work! I need to start filling my empty time with SteinsGate and other relevant media. The translated and visualized DramaCDs sounds like a good start this weekend. So if its not related to SteinsGate then what is it?As Ive probably explained a million times over. The visual novel just took turns that the anime didnt do for the sake of time and budget. This including certain moments and endings. Its odd enough that they take plot specific things out of the anime. How can you toss away MoekaxFB when that is plot specific? I think understand why they do that and that is why I am willing to give it a try. I know for a fact that I will enjoy it. Its whether or not I want to enjoy it that becomes the problem. At least Im not forming a solid objective opinion and preach the damnation of the anime. With that in mind we base everything on subjectivity but what is objectively superior? Is it the visual novel before or is it everything that came after? I have been liberated! The Organization no longer has control over me!Ah damn! A Christmas special is something every animeVN has! I suppose it didnt matter for the sake of plot. Apparently Good Smile and Max Factory released Santa hats specifically for Figma....but that was seven years ago. Ill never find them! Thats older than steins gate!OVAs are just a chance to see the characters again. Its a proper time to develop and release spin off related content. Thats the cool thing about OVAs and shorts. They work around other creative and wonky ideas the writers had. It could be completely noncanon and I wouldnt a give a single fuck. Its content and its a chance to dive back into SteinsGate.Really anything of that type of media can be depressing. Its the fact that you finished it that sets that mood into place. Its the writing and themes that really set the expression of depression. Honestly I think Im a gigantic condescending asshole in real life. Somehow for whatever reason that draws people to me. Hououin Kyouma is slightly different. He is genuine as am I. He can be fixated to a specific archetype. And that most likely is always being an asshole. When in fact if you take the time to measure out his capabilities he is really a caring and kind individual. His persona always gets in the way but he means well. Perhaps that is a decent explanation for myself. How the hell do you even find a real life Tsundere? I probably wouldnt be able to deal with that!,steinsgate,cnzds0u,1,t5_2t8ve

Based on my research this translation could be Watashi wa anata o aishiteimasu translate.google.com Aishiteru yahoo answers Suki Desu howdoyousay.com Aishiteru wa japanese.about.com Suki Yo japanese.about.comBased on the Google Translate pronunciation only Suki Desu and Aishiteru have  syllables which leaves Sayonara Suki Desu and Aishiteru for the potential meanings.

3680500,0,t1_cqbsrn1,Yeah thats where the plot isnt really logical. It goes the same for the Hououin Kyouma part according to Okabe it comes from a TV show he used to watch with Mayuri when they were young  for his first kiss it was either Mayuri it was teased in the VN or some say it is with Moeka since he said his first kiss wasnt that great in the series. Anyway I dont see the movie as a cycle like a lot of people do. It is definitely a plothole but something bothers me  at the end of the movie Kurisu comes back to him but what if his memories were indeed altered? Nothing says that his memory stayed the same. People see it as a plothole because they are certain the actions of Kurisu didnt do a butterfly effect whereas it should have but maybe it  has  They dont talk that much in the end so we cant really say.

5590465,0,t3_3rp3gd,I have also just started playing the game and I am about  hours in... some general tips. S key is save P key brings up your phone. Right click closes textsphone. Left click progresses story. Make multiple save copies as you go through the VN. Also if you have alot of time you can play through without a guide. But I have already seen the anime twice and I want to get the true endings  almost impossible to get without a guide. Steins Gate wiki has a good walk through to help.

6057848,0,t1_cybte61,gtI think were lacking enough in depth information to properly solve gtthis like how worldline shifting happens etc. Because youd think gtthe shift would happen the instant he changes the Upa for agtnonmetal one but yet it doesnt.The world lines seem to only have noticeable shifts when an event occurs that is large enough to actually make a significant digit on Okabes Divergence Meter to change. The tons of texts Moeka gets sent show that just changing it a little may cause no changes at all. The past is different so each time he is probably changing the world line an incredibly marginal amount on those infinite strands of fibers in the thread but the overall thread is still the same. The result of the Upa being metalplastic will not alter the world line in any significant way until the papers get separated from Nakabachi creating a large enough difference to warrant the universe reconstructing itself. The first huge change though is Kurisu being alive but the observable Okabe ditches the world line before he can learn that Kurisu is alive so reading steiner has no reason to kick in until some time after Okabe deletes the DMail using the IBN .When the Okabe were viewing O goes back in the time machine the other Okabe that witnessed the stabbing O is sending a text and is getting sent off to the different world line while the Suzuha and O are on their way back to the line they were coming from. Suzuha and O didnt meet themselves because their first attempt did alter the past slightly so they went back in time on a different fiber in the thread. They also both still existed long enough to use the Time Machine since the true SteinsGate SG shift they were working towards doesnt happen until around the time the thesis burns. Suzuha and Okabe while riding forward in time are still on the original line but once they hit a divergence number where WWIII is no longer an issue around when the thesis burns the world line becomes the SteinsGate line a line where the universe demanded no time machines exist thus no Suzuha and has to find a way to make Okabe carry the stab wound overmerge the two Okabes into one while removing Suzuha from existence. This kinda means that there is now a World Line where Okabe and Suzuha went into the past never to return ditching Mayushii an Daru but oh well The SG World Line view O will have done everything we witnessed up to pressing delete on the IBN thinking that Kurisu is going to die but around the time the thesis catches fire O will overwrite O in the line and because the attractor fieldsuniverse demand it just after O got stabbed in some way were not sure of since the VN just says when he merged back he was with Daru and Mayushii. The anime actually messes the order in the VN up a little creating holes since Okabe is shown to be in the hospital first while in the VN he states he was taken there after he merges back and asks questions and we only see him watch the news about the thesis being burned on his phone either well after the fact or immediately after he merges back since it uses the same art as the first time he watched it in the VN while in the anime he watches crazy Nakabachi live while walking to hand out pins. That can kind of be solved if you move the point in which the line becomes the SG line farther back to maybe when the thesis gets put in the cargo in the plane. The issue there though is getting admitted to surgery and discharged from the hospital then walk around town while handing everyone pins that you had made definitely takes longer than it takes to fly to Russia from Akihabara. Not to mention that the stabbing has to occur the same day Nakabachi leaves for Russia because attractor fields so really the anime goes O gets stabbed somehow gt O becomes O gt O gets admitted to Hospital gt O gets out of hospital commissions pinsgt O gets pins and hands them all out. gt O watches Nakabachi on the news This all supposedly occurs BEFOREDr. N. heads to Russia gt Thesis burns gt Dr. N. goes to prison. Thats an issue since Dr. N leaving for RussiaO getting stabbed are supposed to occur at the same time which means Nakabachi either got stuck in an airport for a month in the Anime or the knife wound healed in time for Okabe to leave the hospital and order the pins to be made before Dr. N. even took off.Disregarding the Anime problems this solves. Why there werent  Okabes. Where the first Okabe is. Where the second Okabe is. Why Suzuha and  Okabes dont exist in the endingIts late right now and been a long time since Ive played the VN so sorry for any poor attempts at explaining how I thought I saw it occur. For some pretty silly plot holes though how about how Suzuha somehow manages to have a bike phone and cell phone service when she only just had arrived? I guess she could have pastmoney from the future might have been stated in the VN but I forget. Then theres also the whole SteinsGate movie plot device and some of the Comptiq Drama CDs where Mayushii and Suzuha go back in time and Mayushii calls herself on her own phone Edit She calls Okabes phone using her own since she is holding it for him when Okabe went to the past and they both then promptly get lost in some transdimensional purgatory which can only mean that there is some awful world line out there that MayushiiSuzuha have disappeared forever in along with Okabe killing Kurisu leaving him alone forever without the two people he spent so much time trying to save. Linearbounded phenogram has an entire  hour long chapter thats basically one big plot hole they basically say so too where  Suzuha Amanes exist at one time in a line where there is no Time Machine no CERN and no WWIII. Then theres a point where Karisu makes software for the time leap machine that enhances it to reduce mental stressallow you to leap larger time periods but using it once will just send you to a point where the enhancement dont exist anymore and Okabe needed to leap back a year. Linear also has that one Ruka route which technically is impossible but the route was still good. Okabe lands in a route near SteinsGate and it seems like both Mayushii and Kurisu are alive and well in it go figure.,steinsgate,cydoiaf,3,t5_2t8ve
6085036,0,t1_cygbyjh,gt The only thing that makes sense is that Suzuha somehow came from the Beta Attractor Field and picked up Okabe to take him back to repeat the saving of Kurisu.The problem here is how time travel in SteinsGate works. The different worldlines dont exist parallel to each other. There one called the active worldline which basically is reality right now. When someone changes something through time travel an other worldline becomes reality and the current one is just gone. This means that Suzuha cant come from an other worldline to pick up Okabe because once he reaches SteinsGate the other worldlines where Suzuha and the time machine actually existed are gone.In order for the Beta worldlines to exist Kurisu has to be dead and World War III has to happen but First Okabe stops both things. So Second Okabe lives on a worldline where neither of those things will happen. He starts on SteinsGate then he THINKS that Kurisu is dead which she isnt and accidently shifts reality to the Alpha worldlines. After deleting the first DMail he returns. The thing is that deleting the DMail does only effect the existence of said DMail but nothing else. So he returns to a worldline where the DMail doesnt save Kurisus life but future Okabe does while Future Okabe also stops World War III. This means Second Okabe returns to a worldline where Kurisu isnt dead so he has no reason to save her and World War III doesnt happen so there is no time machine that could bring him back. And since the Beta worldlines dont exist anymore there is no way any time machine comes into this equation. Second Okabe is basically stuck on the SteinsGate worldline. And as you already managed First Okabe returned stabbed so he is stuck in SteinsGate as well.,steinsgate,cyh87uk,1,t5_2t8ve
6085401,0,t1_cyfr403,gt Im also confused about why youre so fixated on the idea that a story must have its protagonist resolve hisher problems in order for it to be good. A story exists to tell a story not necessarily show a hardearned victory. Moby Dick is an obvious example of this as its critically acclaimed not despite but rather especially because of its ending.Well there are of course no gerenal rules for what elements a story has to contain but there are different genres. You are right that Moby Dick is critically acclaimed but its also a  years old and b not remotely the same type of story SteinsGate is. I mean Hamlet is critically acclaimed and ends with basically everyone dying but that doesnt mean that just killing everyone is an ending that works for every story in existence.Moby Dick is a story about a man being obsessed with revenge against nature not realising that his obsession wont lead to anything but suffering. Its actually rather close to your typical greek tragedy where the hybris of a character ultimately leads to his doom. The ending fits to the plot.SteinsGate on the other hand is a story about a guy trying to save his friends. Its a very goaloriented story Throughout the entire story Okabe wants to save his friends and not much else actually. Its his only goal the only thing he wants to achieve and the only thing the Anime is working towards. If your story is about the protagonist trying to reach a goal you would expect the show to be about him working towards that goal growing in character and finally overcoming his problems to reach it or to fail and at least learn some lesson in the process. Either way the character changed in the end and doesnt end up in the exact same situation he was in the beginning. And regardless of fail or success It should be his own actions that lead him there. Acting or reacting is the difference between a protagonist and character who is just dragged along.spoilerThat said I have two problems with the story in SteinsGate The first is that while its a goaloriented story Okabe himself isnt the character who works towards this goal in any meaningful way and hes not even the one who reaches it in the end. His goal is saving his friends and in the end his friends are saved but Okabe didnt achieve that. He banged his head against a wall trying to save them but failing every time to the point where he is ready to give up in Episode . Up until this point its actually an understandable development since he tried over and over again but just failed everytime. In that sense it actually would be an alright tragic story about a guy trying to fight nature but then realizes that some things are just beyond his powers and moving on. At least if it werent for the actual ending where he basically gets a solution served on a silber platter and gets his happy end without actually earning it. It doesnt have to be a hardearned victory but go through the plot again and ask yourself what exactly Okabes part in saving his friends was. What meaningful thing did he do to save them? The second problem is that Okabe doesnt develop. When I look at him at the end I dont see anything about him that is different from before. Sure he went through a lot but he is still the same wacky Okabe he still likes his friends and he still would use timetravel to save any of them. What exactly has he learned? Sure he fell in love but thats not character development but just something that happened to the character he already was in the first place.spoilerI mean While you may be confused why I say that characters have to resolve their problems in order for the story to be good why do you think character DONT have to resolve their problems? Sure in tragedies characters usually dont resolve their problems or go done doing it but SteinsGate is far from being a tragedy. Can you actually think about a good nontragic story where the protagonist doesnt resolve his problems in some way?gt Ive actually never heard of that interpretation of the ending and it doesnt really make sense to me. The world line should shift for future Okabe the instant he sends the DMail so its irrelevant whether or not he died shortly after from our Okabes perspective.spoilerYou might want to consider that SteinsGate has this rule that too little changes dont shift the worldline at all. When Okabe and the others started experimenting with the phone wave they sent like a dozen DMails back in time that all arrived but had not a single worldline shift occured because none of them were big enough to significantly change history. When Okabe tried to counter Moekas DMail the same thing happened.spoilerThe video mail Okabe sent was encrypted so when Okabe received it he only saw static not causing any big change. Therefor the worldline wouldnt shift. Only after he was able to actually OPEN the mail the worldline ould in theory have changed. But in order for him to open it he needed to fail once which could only happen if he has Suzuhas time machine which he couldnt have before time reached the year   years after Okabe died. So in  when Okabe sent the video mail there was no worldline shift because past Okabe couldnt open it. Then in  Okabe is already dead and Suzuha travels back with her time machine which is the thing causing the worldline shift.spoilergt I dont understand why you think she wouldnt want to put her emotions to paper the same way anyone would write in a diary.spoilerIts not really the fact that she wrote a letter but rather the whole scenario. Sure she fucked up but at the same time we are talking about  year old Suzuha here. I understand that she might remember her duty and would want to fix things which she can do but at the same time she live like  years happily in the past. She probably has a job friends and some goals in life. Of course she will be shocked remembering her past but at the same time I dont see why this would cause her to immediately forget the last  years of her life become crazy and kill herself. Its not like her life is worthless because of that. It just feels like manufactured drama. The author wanted a Oh god that poor girl killed himself! moment rather then a more logical Hey there Okabe! Im  year old Suzuha. Long time no see. We have to change our plan a bit. moment.spoiler,steinsgate,cyh9xkm,0,t5_2t8ve

6704669,0,t1_d0csi5q,Ah! Thank you for using my post! I am honored you think it was a good enough explanation for you to use it in your wiki.I think your rewriting of it is good but it might need a little more detail. For example one thing that I noticed was that many people that asked this question did not realize that a death did not automatically mean a convergence point. I would mention this as well as mention the example in the show of Moeka dying in ep  and  but living with her Dmail getting cancelled. Also you might want to add in the fact that the reason Kurisu died the first time in ep  was because by trying to save her like that Okabe was unintentionally trying to change the convergence point the Dmail so he ended up stabbing her. He saved her in  because he acknowledged this convergence and went about changing things in a way where it wouldnt threaten the convergence.I realize this might be too much but if you do rewrite it again feel free to use this comment or my original post as you wish and also feel free to link to my full explanation if you want to add that as an option for more indepth understanding too. I can understand it might be hard to fit all this and still seem short and sweet though so do as you please!One last question for your FAQ you might want to add is Why couldnt Okabe just send a Dmail saying not send any Dmails after the first one? Wouldnt this save him the trouble of undoing them one at a time?My explanation for this is also in the post I linked but I have worked out a better explanation with some images to accompany the expanation too but I have yet to post it.

In ep  the new event is she is knocked out with blood Okabe sees the body and screams and I presume the police still come while he leaves the building and sends a mail to Daru.

Save when Chapter  begins and after that save near every ending the decision points which lead to bad endings are usually quite clear and they start during Chapter . The good endings work on a flag system. Certain choices trigger flags and theres a total of  of them. If you have  by the time you reach the end of the game you get the Mayuri ending.

8627429,0,t3_4y0tz0,Yo mods are these questions part of the wiki? I feel they come up a lot. Th first dmail doesnt save Kurisu. Its what first changes there world line. Why it had so much effect? Because it was caught by SERNs machineEPsomething name please that captures emails. With this SERN was able to create a time machine which in turn lead to the Time Machine Suzuha comes back in unfinished because of the whole war thing going on I believe Kurisu from episode one is dead. Why? Because when he goes back to save her... the first time he cant say anything and just runs off about to crywhich is what she hints at when she meets current Okabe. And then there is the second time he goes back which when they meet he says I will save you. Most likely correct? But I dont believe the IBN was needed anymore. Them undoing the last dmail resulting going back to the dead Kurisu line was because they deleted the mail from SERNs Secret Database using the IBM to decode the info. Once they switched back they no longer needed it. So Im not sure if she went back for the IBM then. But she still has to come back to them to stop WW.,steinsgate,d6k16e7,3,t5_2t8ve

8961165,0,t1_d7gd5rx,No one does.OKabe is stil hiding behind his Kyouma persona which is clearly not only there to help Mayuri but because I think Okabe actually hates himself. Kyouma is what he wishes he was. Okabe is not confident very sociable or a genius. He is much more average and dull.Kurisu almost killed by her own father and her whole point was trying to get closer to him. This is definitely not happening after he tried to kill her. She will keep being an emotionally distant person who cant really open up.Mayuri and Daru are fine I guess. Daru is aware of his unhealthy lifestyle but what was the beginning of it ? Why did he became like that ? Disppointed in real life and D ?Luka is still not comfortable with his gender and his sexuality which is a clearly big problem who can causes identity crisis and further mental health problems.Faris hides her pain of losing her father behind her persona and drown herself in work to cope. She is not the worst of the bunch but she is not doing that good.Moeka is still struggling with social interactions and she cant get very far in life if she keep talking only by SMS.Almost all of the characters have issues those issues are not especially portrayes in the serie but you can see their existence with a bit of reflexion.

9720091,0,t3_5eaqpq,What I understood it asfrom the anime Before sg starts they live on the beta world line. Steinsgate happens except this okabe tries and fails to save Kurasu. He gets sent the time machine by a future okabe who gets the time machine from Daru. As WwIII happens Daru makes a time machine based on the paper kurasus father publishes. Thats the time machine that zero okabe gets sent. The future okabe may or may not have been through the steinsgate events he may have just been trying to combat WWIII. But as I said zero okabe fails and maybe didnt have enough fuel or something to try again. This sends the world to a new world line but not past the divergence. He had a lifetime to contemplate his mistake and so he sends a time machine to original okabe with this new plan and he succeeds passing into steinsgate. Ive got another variation only involving two okabes buts its more complex. I may edit when I have time,steinsgate,dab7nzq,1,t5_2t8ve

Okabe who tried save Kurisu once but failed and lived reevaluating his mistakes. He got time machine from third Okabe. Okabe whose life is unknown. He sent time machine to second Okabe though. All time machines was built by Daru. Did I get it right? I cant find a hint about rd Okabes existence anywhere though.

I thought it was very obvious only a few hours into the game how Mayuri herself felt from her actions vs what Okabe felt for herI was always thinking how oblivious can this guy be?. Steins Gate  only made it more obvious by throwing it in your face and giving her far more screentime not that I think thats a bad thing since I never did like the Kirisu ending after taking Maruyis routewhich I enjoyed far more in both the first amp second game.

10500134,0,t3_5qczyi,Lets clarify a bit on how time travel works in SG first off There is only one active world line. All other world lines exist in a potential state. They are not full alternate realities. World line shifts are immediate and complete. Without Reading Steiner theyd be impossible to notice. Of course everyone has Reading Steiner in varying degrees and thats how we experience deja vu. World lines are also bundled together with Attractors. These are events that converge on all world lines in the bundle Field. It takes a radical change to shift world lines thats not bound to the same Attractor Field as the current world line.As soon as each D Mail is sent regardless of if its meant to undo an earlier one or not the world line changes. As theres only one active world line theres no possibility of a person who has undone a D Mail being able to reundo it. And the undoing of a D Mail in the story was always done in such a way that it prevented the original D Mail from working even though they were still received Okabe telling his past self not to follow Suzuha sending a spam message to Lukas mom so shed ignore the one that changed Lukas gender convincing Fariss father not to alter his travel plans further using Yuugos phone to order Moeka to stop pursuing the IBN. So they were all undone in ways that would not leave the original D Mails being retried in the past especially since it took Okabe a while to even notice things were different after each original D Mail.Furthermore recall when they tried to use a D Mail to win the lottery no change resulted from that so they didnt even need to undo it. They knew from the beginning of their experiments that not all D Mails would work and they wouldnt keep trying the same one over and over. Their past selves wouldve just accepted that their D Mail hadnt worked and they wouldve moved on to another experiment with someone else.,steinsgate,dcyauj7,19,t5_2t8ve

He tries to save Kurisu st time but manages to kill her Nakabachi escapes with his paper picks Metal Upa prevents fire and invents time machine  then  years of planning to save Kurisu commences SteinsGate   which Okabe needs to work out that Kurisu doesnt have to die  AS LONG AS HE   before sending first Dmail to Daru THINKS SHE DIED. On nd try he gets things to fake Kurisus death picks up Metal Upa which prevented destruction of Nakabachi paper saves Kurisu. So Kurisu is saved time machine is never invented Dmail is never used every instance of usage is from future which changes after arriving to SteinsGate.,steinsgate,dd2ubik,1,t5_2t8ve

11249357,0,t1_df71y89,Yeah Im not really sure what hes referring to here especially since  years ago is about when  was announced which means that might not even be what hes referring to. I guess it could be the Variant Space Octet aka SteinsGate Bit.If hes talking about the Epigraph Trilogy then theres only  hence the name.Theres novelization of the first Visual Novel which is adapted into  light novels.Theres the two Ouroboros light novels that I know nothing about except that they exist.Theres a few other light novels but nothing else really comes in a set of .,steinsgate,df73jkk,1,t5_2t8ve

11438858,0,t1_dfsks2k,Its miles better than Chaos Head but subpar to SteinsGate. But thats inherentSteinsGate according to ranime could have potential for the anime of the decade.Overall I liked Robotics Notes. I rarely find mech anime enticing but I liked this one since it was a lot more realistic about mech suits.Also I got super triggered because Naechan is  years old and a main ish character in RN the exact age she is in that one SG world line where she becomes a rounder and time leaps  years back or so so I was super on edge the entire anime which added to suspense.spoiler,steinsgate,dfsl0yg,5,t5_2t8ve

11482822,0,t1_dfxk29b,Short version Official translation is Luka. Long version Yeah it is pronounced something similar to rukako but it is the same as other characters like for example Lala from To love ru you hear Rara Satarin Deviruke but it is Lala Satalin Deviluke strange example but it is the only one I can remember right now. Its a decision of the translators but I guess that it is because it a sound closer to L than R.,steinsgate,dfxkqky,2,t5_2t8ve
11536970,0,t1_dg3iir1,I believe that stuff was included from the start for the PS Vita and Steam versions since the  version was released well before any of those versions existed at least the console versions not really sure when Japan got a PC release. At the very least I remember most if not all of this from when I played through on the Vita.Its entirely possible that whichever of the new versions released first was going to have all of this stuff already so they decided to release it as cheap DLC for the  version as to not give other markets as much of an advantage. That said Im not an expert on this so I imagine someone else may have a more definitive answer.,steinsgate,dg3pun8,5,t5_2t8ve
