910307,0,t1_ch6yse8,There are some great BYOB sushi spots in Chicago. Bring a bottle of Champagne and a light white or even sake if you are into that. Spend  on the two bottles it will be tough to spend over  on just food at even some of the nicest sushi restaurants in the city. I recommend Coast in Bucktown. It is dimly lit and a great spot for couples however it is popular and reservations are a must. If you need help picking out specific wines I will help.,chicagofood,ch7rado,1,t5_2s9qq

People would come from all the boroughs to get it from them.  On a side note the gyros from Greece are pretty bad.  They even put the fries in the pita. ,chicagofood,ctf2szr,2,t5_2s9qq
