1140252,0,t3_275ruk,Thats awful but Im afraid thats not how cryptocurrency works. One of the big ideas with this stuff is that you dont need to provide ID or an email to get a wallet address. Tracing those coins would be a wild goose chase. I strongly suggest you stay away from EBay they dont understand cryptocurrency either.,worldcoinalliance,chxw0qu,2,t5_312zi
