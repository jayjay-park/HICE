10474755,0,t3_5ptyjs,gt In both the cinematic and especially true in the TV show adaptations they have taken that particular facet of the plot and used it to create interest and to connect each of the episodes together. Yeah thats why they do it and as a book reader Im actually kind of happy its different. Reddit wasnt really around when the books were being published so its nice to have people to theorize with about what will happen later.,booksVmovies,dcvf78c,1,t5_3iatj
10489961,0,t1_dcw6bb1,isnt that exactly what Tony is though? An irredeemable mustachetwirling asshole who thinks HE has all the right answers? This also ignores the huge reduction in Spidermans role during the Civil War events. He was fanservicepretty damn awesome fanservice and probably had more to do with the movie rights in the movie nothing more. Whereas in the comic he actually plays a decisive role in bringing and then taking supporters away from Tony when it becomes apparent what Tony Hank and Reed have created.,booksVmovies,dcx5b89,2,t5_3iatj

10832142,0,t3_5tygp4,As an aside the audio books for Rogue One and Bloodlines are very well done. If you have the time they are put on like radio dramas with sound effects and all great for driving or playing MMOs where your mind may want distraction. ,booksVmovies,ddx9c8k,2,t5_3iatj
10838171,0,t3_5uw65l,I was wondering BooksVMovies just now and saw this. It just so happens that Im watching Field of Dreams right now with my son.  Great film.  Ill have to see if I can get an audio book version of the book.  ,booksVmovies,ddxvplc,2,t5_3iatj
10848913,0,t3_5uu9vb,The book is awesome. I was a bit disappointed with a few missing elements in the series but its minor. I realise things have to be compacted but Millers arc is much better in the book. All in all they complement each other nicely.My only gripe comes with the second book. The first book starts fascinating and only keeps getting better till the end. But the second book doesnt keep up the tempo it comes to a jarring halt and has to start picking up momentum again.,booksVmovies,ddyzlyj,1,t5_3iatj
