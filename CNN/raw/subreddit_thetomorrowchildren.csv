Apparently its by designDylan But at the same time not making it like a standard multiplayer game because if you have that where you see people all the time you get that multiplayer peer pressure problem because youre always being looked at. Some people get uncomfortable. So if youre just standing around playing at a relaxed pace and looking around and going Oh I wonder what that is someone could be looking at you going Whos that idiot?
