7495274,0,t1_d2u3amr,gt . Eneasz asked how is one maximally happy person different from another maximally happy person? The answer is Your different experiences your different preferences etc.That assumes there are still different experiences different preferences etc. I am not convinced that this is the case for a maximally happy person and I think Jason was on board with that since he agreed that tiling the universe with that person is feasible. I really cannot recommend the example of kabbalistic!NeilArmstrong enough. Im going on an extreme wirehead model of maximum pleasure here not just the happiest that a currentlyexisting person could be in the present day.I would answer . the same way. Yes we would move closer to being like each other and yeah theres not really anything wrong with that. But wed still be different people with different experiences. I was under the impression we were speaking of wireheading at that point in the conversation with Orgasmium basically being the drugequivalent.A relevant sidenote  if everyone did eventually become identical I wouldnt consider them separate people anymore. One very large person with the moral weight of any other person yes. But still just one person. If I was one body in such a person and one of me was killed I would feel that I had just gotten smaller not that I had been murdered.gtBy pushing the button at that point you might not be extinguishing humans but you would be extinguishing the happy lifeforms that come after. Would you wipe out the super happies?!? You brute! While I do think the superhappies are crippled compared to WC humans at least they still interacted with the real world and real people. I wouldnt wipe them out any more than I would wipe out a race of very happy puppies.I think it would be a good idea to have an episode on wireheading and maybe at the same time an episode on the value or lack thereof of mental complexity. I value mental complexity over happiness. A race that made that trade fully exchanging all mental complexity for unparalleled bliss see again kabbalistic!NeilArmstrong  would have zero value in my view. I wouldnt wipe them out necessarily... why bother spending the resources to do so? But I wouldnt view them as beings with moral weight and would have no problem demolishing their planet to make room for the intergalactic superhighway onramp. Unless there were other lifeforms on it I guess like squirrels or salamanders.see also my replies earlier where I say that I value good states of the world and that happiness is a signal that the state of the world is good and desirable for that reason. But that if you divorce the signal from the actual state then it is the state that matters and the signal is valueless,thebayesianconspiracy,d2u68o5,3,t5_3chfi
