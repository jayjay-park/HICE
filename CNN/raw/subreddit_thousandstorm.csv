10418828,0,t1_dckc3d4,Sorry I didnt man.  TBH when Global Officially releases its gonna be a reroll fest anyways.  The only card thats actually decent later from the Tutorial Pull from what I can tell on the JP Wiki is the  War Scene Card featuring Luffy amp Zoro.If we follow JPs releases next Raid will feature BrookSW LuffyY Law followed by Mihawk.  Pretty confident people are gonna reroll their accounts for Mihawk unless they are already happy with their established soft launch account.,thousandstorm,dcp1jfv,1,t5_3iggv

10550604,0,t1_dd3vcxq,To my knowledge only Rebecca and Y Brook SA Cards can be obtained via FP Pull.The only other way to get SA Abilities is through the Gacha for other Characters.  For Fame Event Characters ie. Mihawk you can obtain their SA Card in the Event by hitting a certain threshold of Fame.,thousandstorm,dd412id,2,t5_3iggv
