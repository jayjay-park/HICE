Romance is too commontiredetc kind of falls flat when there exist examples of platonic relationships others have already brought up on this very subreddit. They exist and to claim that they dont is to be intellectually dishonest. Now is romance between protagonists more common than platonic relationships? Very likely...but the antishippers seem to see this as like the only one possible example in the history of cinema. It doesnt need to be the example of all examples.

When I saw Nick Wilde in Zootopia and how he interacted with the other characters I realized that Nick is everything that I WISH I was. Hes selfconfident opinionated sly and cunning. Any advice about how I could go about handling this problem? I know you guys arent psychologists but Im wondering what I can do to shake this concern off of myself.If youre looking for a role model of selfconfidence and general psychological health Nick probably isnt the best choice. The movie heavily implied that hes NOT as confident as he acts and has spent most of his life repressing his real emotions out of fear of showing weakness and having others take advantage of him. Being unable to open up to anyone is NOT good for you.,zootopia,d1mpq1y,5,t5_2y5oo

A drink in a dirty glass in one hand as he spoke of tales of daring heroism and plunder.  Some of them may even be accurate.And so I stood on the deck of the ship sword in one hand and a chest of gold in the other well lets say ladies he was less than thrilled as I made my escape.  he wiggled a small pouch which jingled.  The other two smiled a little more.  the evening held.. promise for the fox.The vixen leaned forward and licked her muzzle slightly And dear Nicky is any of that true?Nick laughed Perhaps some of it was. Does it really matter?The cheetah smiles and blinked slowly with a languid smile Perhaps.. she stopped as her ears flicked towards the entrance of the darkened bar her eyes widened as she asked Oh my.  Is that a bunny?Hmmmm?  Nick didnt bother to turn around A bunny?  Theyre rare around here. Probably someones servant or slave. He made an idle gesture Not important really.  What is important are you two! he laughed as he took a swallow of his drink.  The vixen joined in laughter while the cheetah watched behind him.  He felt rather heard the mood of the bar change.Nicholas.  Piberius. Wilde.Nicks smile congealed into a stark rictus grin.  The high pitched voice that uttered his name was laced with steal and promised pain if it was being ignored.  He turned around slowly.  There was a small bunny dressed head to toe in a naval captains uniform.  Perfectly pressed not a stitch out of place.  Her paws were resting lightly on the hilt of a blade the tip dug into the dirty floor.  her ears were ram rod straight.  Around here the unsavory patrons of the bar watched in curiosity.Nick tried to form a more natural smile What.. he swallowed What brings you here?  I never expected.. He trailed off as one of the nearby inebriated patrons a rather large rhino moved up from his table and started lumber over.  He heard himself whimper as he whispered nononono under his breath.The Rhino broke out into a huge grin Hey there bunny!  Arent you cute! Nick winced slightly Why dont you come over here and give a real man some attention!  The Rhino burst out laughing as his table companions joined in.The Rabbits ears twitched towards the rhino but the steel violet eyes never left Nicks face.  With a smooth motion she pulled a pistol from his belt aimed it to the side and shot the rhino in the face.The Rhino staggered back as he roared You stupid bunny!  You shot my horn off!  Sure enough as the smoke cleared the tattered remains of the horn were left along with a very angry rhino.Next shot goes between the eyes.  Leave us alone Im having a pleasant conversation with the fox here.  her ears twitched slightly.Hahahaha.  was the response from Nick What do you want..He was cut off My ship leaves in three hours.  You will be on it.Nick leaned back. The table wobbled slightly Ahh.  Well Im with Finnick and..  Once again he was cut off.  The Rabbit pulled a scroll out from under her jacket and tossed it at the fox who awkwardly caught it.I made arrangements.  Finnick has already sailed off. You serve with me now.  Your gear is already stowed on board.  Three hours fox.  Dont make me come find you. Again.Nick stared at the scroll then swept the hat of his head and knelt down before the bunny with a cheeky grin Aye Aye Sir.  The bunny in question nodded once then turned around and walked out.  All eyes on her.  Nick released a breath he didnt know he was holding.  The Rhino was the next to speak She shot my horn off!Nick muttered Be thankful mate.  She usually aims a lot lower if you catch my drift.The vixen spoke up again Nicky who was that?That. my dear was Judith Hopps.  Captain of the Zootopia. He drained his glass.  His evening which has just looked so promising was now markedly less so.EDIT  Forgot a brief moment to match the picture.,zootopia,d1n80rk,3,t5_2y5oo

7140136,0,t3_4dbqd4,I love Cats Dont Dance but its portrayal of racism is dated. Thats not necessarily a bad thing since the film is supposed to be a period piece set in the late s. Still Zootopia hits closer to home which makes the message stand out more. Ive never seen another movie targetted at children that talks about racism in such a mature modern way. Its so refreshing since even films targeted at adults are prone to examining racism as if its a dated concept that ended with racial segregation in America. Ive also got to give points to Zootopia for realistically showing that prejudice still remains a problem in modern society even after the mystery is solved. Meanwhile CDD wrapped up its racism plot a little too perfectly. There was a single grand performance and suddenly all the animals were accepted as stars into the film industry. Thats...not how Hollywood worked back then. Plus Zootopia was just more nuanced overall. Zootopia clearly showed how racism is a complex idea that can hurt anyone regardless of race while CDD was more blackandwhite about its conflict humans are obviously the oppressors. ,zootopia,d1pr8t4,3,t5_2y5oo

Being an animator is a lifelong dream but Ive always been more of a purist in that CGI animation was never really my thing. But after seeing Zootopia and the technologies used to create it Im definitely open to considering a major in it finding somewhere to major in D is getting harder and harder since its been on a decline lately Fanfiction  Ive never really been inspired to write my own fanfiction before. Ive read tons and tons but just never felt the urge to come up with a plot and hammer a story out from start to end. Ive now got like  stories sitting in my to complete folder and a few other ideas in the queue. Baking  I kind of flirt with baking every now and then usually just cakes and cookies because pies always seemed intimidating to me. Now though Im filled with fire to take a good crack at it and hopefully get to the point where distant relatives clamor over a slice of my wares at family get togethers  Wildlife care  The movie has inspired me to watch a lot of fox videos on YouTube heh. One channel in particular the WildlifeAidTV has inspired me to maybe volunteer at a rehabilitation center for wildlife. Its really tragic seeing the sorts of things that wild animals go through just as a consequence of living in close proximity to humans. The average fox doesnt make it past his st birthday and will rarely live past the age of . Furryism???  ... Haha ok no probably not. But seeing the furry community in the subreddit has made me consider adding a character who has that particular hobby into an original story Im writing. Its definitely made me reconsider some of the harsher and unfair opinions Ive had on the furry community before this movie.,zootopia,d1vw8i4,4,t5_2y5oo

7350471,0,t1_d2d58jd,Ok my Google Fu is failing me HARD with trying to locate the exact article my friend linked me about this re asexualitylgbt peoples and population control. But it was REALLY interesting because it opened up a whole new can of worms in regards to wether someone is really and truly Born This Way or if they subconsciously CHOOSE such a lifestyle due to some part of our primitive hindbrain acknowledging the downward spiral of mankind due to the population boom. Basically were combating natures usual methods of population control war famine and disease so this is kind of a... lastditch psychological method of keeping out numbers in check if you will.I dunno. When I google population control and asexuality most of the article had to do with asexuality most of what I get is a lot of angry posts on Tumblr saying Thats not how genetics work! etc haha. Theres also the anecdotal evidence   years ago the LGBTQA population was much much lower and now people are saying that the usual given  is now much closer to . But then that could have just always been true given the reluctance for people to even consider coming OUT  years ago.But uh that was a long long tirade. Ahem.I could maybe see how Judys  siblings arent ACTUALLY born of her mom and dad and could maybe actually just be cousins. But then I was was raised in that kind of culture myself  at least I refer to my cousins born on my mothers side as my sisters. Culturally Im expected to. As well as anyone else who shares my first clan even if were not blood related but thats a whole other thing.I wouldnt put it past rabbit communities to be so close knit where the line separating my family from your family is blurred honestly. Its probably really honestly hard to find someone to date who isnt related to you through marriage or blood heh.EDIT Also you raise a good point with Fru Fru and I dont really have anything to counter argue that except maybe she only had one girl gestating in her belly and the rest of the litter were boys P But thats a weak argument.,zootopia,d2dp5fi,2,t5_2y5oo

7481455,0,t1_d2sk18p,Sounds like a good time for them to show off their powers but I wouldnt let them mention or show their powers beforehand. I would treat it more as a reveal and we see their powers in full effect the first time they actually use it to give the best impression.But with having them babysitting is really a good idea for Nick and Judy to spend some time together and talk about the past events and show the kits in a bit more ordinary situation.When we show them bringing the kits to work I dont know where to exactly put it. Maybe even before their first act of heroism? That maybe they take some motivation to do something from that visit?Flow taking more care of her siblings could easily be made into With great power comes great responsibility. And I also got the idea that Jolt and Flare might bribe Flow into babysitting while they sneak out but her inner narration reveals that she actually prefers doing it that way.There should be an early scene but not to early that we learn how withdrawn Flow is where she spends some time alone with Nick and its the first time we see her open up to anyone.I think Nick would be amused by them listening to their mother because it would remind him of himself but Judy would be against it because shes afraid they hear something they shouldnt.We can at least base their personalities somewhat on their powers at least partially. That gives a base where other details can be added to.,zootopia,d2sll5g,2,t5_2y5oo

So assuming it developed in the same timescales then the technology for shock collars simply wouldnt have existed that long ago. So it may be a more recent thing Im thinking more around the s. Perhaps they were implemented after Zootopia was on the brink of a predatorprey civil war after some high profile predator incidents. So people would be afraid of questioning the collars as they are seen as the best way of preventing a similar conflict reoccurring. Regardless of how the collars came about they still seemed to be so deeply incorporated into the lives of zootopians that it would take more than a bad mayor to change it and it certainly wouldnt happen overnight. Even the predators seemed to embrace the system in some weird way via things like the slightly bizarre taming ceremony where coming of age was celebrated with the fitting of the collar.,zootopia,d3hxb5z,1,t5_2y5oo

7777906,0,t1_d3q1x7z,Im not gonna lie. I have basically this whole series finished in my head. And while that is an interesting twist it just doesnt fit too well for my story. Mr Big and the ZIA have a mutual you ignore me and I ignore you thing going on. Thats why Tyler was able to try to join the ZIA. Mr Big trying to start problems wouldnt really make too much sense. Tyler knows who he is killing throughout his time working for Mr Big. He gets plenty of information on his targets to know how they work so them being undercover agents wouldnt really flow either. Tyler also knows who killed his parents and it was Tommy One Fang. That was Tylers first kill and thats why he saw him in his dream. I didnt really specifically have Tyler say yeah I was the one to kill him but you hinted it when explaining his past and he saw him during the dream. While I respect your offer to help writing this story is something I kinda wanna talk alone you know?

One of the things Judy learned is that everyone in fact cannot be anything but they should still strive for their dreams and try hard.  Everyone has limitations is part of her speech after all. I suppose stuff like this is more for people that didnt see it yet though perhaps?  If the movie embraced Everyone can be anything! fully it wouldnt have the depth it does.

The last time I was into a ship on a similar level was  or  years ago when I was big into Naruto. I cant put my finger on what it is that makes me so into it. Ive been looking at all the cute fanart even reading some of the fan fics. Despite not being even in the realm of what most consider a furry Ive even been interested in some of the smutty stuff. Can anyone relate? Wildehopps is legitimately giving me an introspective breakdown here. One theory I have is that I can very much relate to Judy and traveling to a big new city for the first time. That and her resolve in the film is really inspiring and makes me want to perform similarly in my time here. Still doesnt explain the furry stuff...Send help.Sincerely A grown man that will watch the sequel exclusively to see whether a cartoon rabbit and fox kiss.,zootopia,d4sbt8u,8,t5_2y5oo

I dont see Gideon as a threat to WildeHopps he surely admires Judy but probably thinks shes out of his league.

8582274,0,t1_d6dkhrq,This is attempt at writing the Flares first date also his first date with Tazelle I think.Due to it going far longer than I ever intended its a first part of sorts  may finish it later.I tried to write this more in the style of actual draft writing for feedback and hopefully I learned something from the last rambly scene I wrote.Im going with the assumption that the family as a whole is used to using the public transit system but owns a big to them SUV capable of carrying the whole family of .Since the road has to accommodate vehicles that fit much bigger mammals it seems believable that some vehicles would have big mammal size and smaller mammal seating.When the younger litter was even younger it was a bit hard to corral them with public transit it was and kind of still is just safer and more convenient.Nick and Judy and the older litter during mischief like taking them snowboarding in Tundratown still take them on public transit when it makes sense.I think we had Nick dropping off the kits for ranger scouts anyway but it made me think of it again.Flare nervously adjusted his collared buttonup Tshirt for the fifth time as they neared Gazelles luxurious home.Are you sure this looks good? Should I wear a tie? Maybe I could borrow  Nick cut him off while a quick glance and a smile as he drove.Youre asking me for fashion advice now? Well I still think a Pawaiian shirt and a tie  Dad! Im serious! Shes got like two hundred outfits and they all look good. What if she thinks I look tacky. Am I under dressed?Nick started to pull up to the gate and paused briefly to call in Nick here dropping off Flare to open it before responding.You said she told you to dress casually and comfortably for the date and you fit the bill.Flare scratched behind his ear in apprehension as Nick pulled up to the house.But what does that really mean?  I dont even know where shes taking me what if  Nick stopped the car a short distance away from the house.Flare youve already spent enough time with her to count as several dates and she knows how you dress. Itll be fine. Now you dont want her to see your tacky dad on your first date do you?Flare took in a breath to steel himself before exiting the car.Fine youre right itll be fine. Thanks for the drive dad.Anytime and just call me when its over.Flare stepped out of the car and after some final last minute adjustments rang the doorbell.Deep breaths itll be fine Tazelle immediately opened to door on hearing the ring looking down to see her small boyfriend jump in reaction then wag his tail as he took in her casual dress.You look beautiful.Always to the point I guess. Aww that tail is adorable!Tazelle giggled before speaking. Way to break the ice Flare. You dont look bad yourself.Flare gave a small sigh of relief before letting out a brief Ah! as she suddenly picked him and carried him while speaking.Come inside for a bit. I have a ride ready but theres something we need first.Flare settled into her arms as his tail started wag again.Are you going to tell me where were going?Tazelle gave a mischievous grin and set Flare down on a counter. Nope! Itll be my surprise its more special that way. And just so you dont peek you can ride in...this!She placed a large purse by him earning a perplexed look from him.A...purse? Are you sure that will work?Tazelle smiled as she opened it to show him.I tested it with some plushies your size and took out most of my stuff so itll be comfortable. You even have a pillow and a blanket in there!Seeing Flare blushing with a nervous pose cooled her excitement quickly.Is this too weird? Did I go too far? Tazelle youre such an idiot.But um if thats too weird I could just carry you normally or you could walk  Flare cut her off with a reassuring tone.No its no problem and I love it when you carry me. I was just surprised is all. It sounds fun! Could you help me get into it though?Shew hes okay with it. This is either the best idea or the worst idea.Sure thing! Now youll want to lay down in it I cant zip it up if youre sittingTazelle gently picked Flare up and laid him down in the purse watching him turn a bit to get comfortable before setting down.Oh hes just adorable in there! Ill probably have some funny fur in my purse now but its totally worth it.Tazelles admiration showed on her face as the asked Comfy?Flare seemed to have found a good position as he spoke.Not much legroom but its good. How long am I going to be in here?It should be about forty minutes maybe more if we run into traffic. If you want out or need something just call me or something.Flare smiled as he spoke seeming relaxed in the purse.Sure thing and thanks for the pillow.Tazelle indulged herself in tucking Flare in and scratching behind his ears briefly.Always easy to tell when he likes something with that blush and tail wag.Anything for you my precious little plush. Now are you sure you want to do this?Flare nodded as he adjusted the pillow.Im sure.Then see you in a bit cutie.Tazelle smiled down on him blushing as she zipped the purse shut and carried it to a waiting car.I cant believe I have my boyfriend in my purse!...Wow hes trusting me a lot with this. Thats really sweet come to think of it. Now gotta hold it steady make sure I dont bump anything...Hes a bit heavier than I thought hed be with one arm but it works.The chauffeur was waiting at the car as she arrived.Are you ready to go miss Tazelle? Where is youre  Tazelle pat the purse before he continued. Ah I see. Be sure to hold him steady at least if he isnt wearing a seatbelt.I know I know. Now lets get going!Tazelle set the purse on her lap and hugged it with one arm to keep it steady while the other texted Flare.You okay in there?After a brief delay he texted back.Yeah Im fine. Im in the car on your lap now right?She wiggled her knees a bit in response and heard a brief Wah! from Flare as he steadied himself again.That answers that just keep things steady okay? It feels like Im in an earthquake when you do that.Tazelle blushed as the texted back.Sorry.Also it really smells like perfume in here.Oh! I forgot to take them out. Jeeze thats a good nose.Sorry again.No problem. It smells kind of nice actually it reminds me of you.Guess dad was right when he said that canines pay a lot of attention to smells.Tazelle blushed at that and responded after pausing to think.Thanks Ill be sure to spray you with some of it.Tazelle cut it out!After a pause Flare texted again.Actually maybe just a little after the date. It really does remind me of you.Sure thing funny boy.The driver noticed their antics and called back.Are you texting each other? Why not just talk?Tazelle chuckled Its more fun this way you wouldnt understand.And some things are better kept private.The driver turned his attention back to the road No I wouldnt. Im afraid the roads are busy today it could be an hour or more before we get to  well before we arrive at your destination.Tazelle sighed Okay thanks for keeping me posted.She started another text.I guess you overheard that with those cute ears we may be here for awhile. Want out of the purse?Ill be fine in here it really is pretty comfy. And besides I dont want to ruin your surprise.Tazelle smiled as she texted back I promise youll love it.I love doing anything with you.Oh you.Save that talk for when we get there my cute little doll.But its hard with such a giant beauty like you.Tazelle was caught between giggling and rolling her eyes at the remark but couldnt resist the former.Thats just so sappy. Ah who cares I like it.After a brief pause he sent another text Im going to try to rest for a bit now see you there.Tazelle pat the purse in response and closed her eyes to relax on the way.After an hour of silence in the car Tazelle finally walked out to their destination being careful to keep the purse steady as she set it on a bench and opened it.Were here Flare. You can  She put a hand over her mouth to silence an aww! as she saw Flare sleeping in her purse.He looks so peaceful like that! Oh I could just  I think I will.After a quick opportunistic picture she leaned down and gave him a large kiss on the cheek adding in some purring to wake him up.He blinked with a confused expression before seeing her face and remembering where he was.Um hi. Geeze Im sorry for falling asleep on our first  He was cut off by Tazelle lifting him out of the purse and into a quick hug.Dont be youre adorable when youre sleeping. So do you like my purse?Flares blush and tail wag returned as he struggled to look at her while speaking.It feels pretty homely and I feel really relaxed and safe when you carry me.After she set Flare down he sniffed the air and tilted his ears to a nearby sound before asking Are we at a beach?Tazelle smiled as reached down to hold his hand and she led him.We sure are and I hope youre hungry! Guidads has the best food on the beach it may even get you to like meat.Meat? Tazelle I  Tazelle interrupted with a smirk ve probably never had gourmet predator food. Try everything remember?Flare sighed with his response Anything for you Tazelle.She smiled and flicked his farther arm with her tail teasingly.Dont worry Ill get us some meatless food to in case you dont like it.Isnt the guy supposed to  Trust me youre going to want me to pay for this. Dont worry I get a big allowance.,zootopia,d6edboo,2,t5_2y5oo

8803453,0,t1_d760zk6,Ahh see now you always ask the really interesting questions.So i am sure you are aware the  simple physical machines that make up the bulk of our current technology?  So my question was what are the basic machines of a K civ?I call them the  basics Extrusion Refraction Projection.  Extrusion is StarTrek replicator essentially but i prefer to call it an mEc device.  Refraction phases a volume of space time out of one of the fundamental force fields electro weak strong gravitational higgs etc?.  Projection or Syntropy Projection is the ability to send usable energy in arbitrary amount an arbitrary distance.  Between all those you could pretty quickly get yourself to K.At present humanity has only been able to unlock the first  no projection yet.  FTL is accomplished by using refractors to phase the mass of the ship ya ever play Mass Effect? and then use conventional and reactionless drives.  The problem is energy requirement its enormous i am tiered of scifi just having magic warp drives that are just so easy to power.  I call it the Big E Problem or E Barrier.  Meaningfully long FTL trips are impossible because you simply cannot take that much energy with you the more you bring the more it takes to transition the fuel similar to the barrier we have hit with modern rocketry.  Projection would solve that problemSo NTL near to light travel is the name of the game and they can do it without any frame drag.They have the tiles a dysons swarm around Sol but with essentially no ability to go anywhere or wield that power at meaningful distances from Sol.  Think Tantalus.  Rubicon is the th point on the SR star route  that is a series of  rings space an average of .ly apart and they are able to project a corridor of mass shifted space allowing for an average of c between Sol and Centari still no frame drag.  But its highly regulated and there is a budget to how much can be sent down the pipe.  It was also only recently completed.  Ergo the Void Runners whom limp along at c between systems.  Except our antihero of the story has a ship that can do c all the way to proxima beating the pants off even the SR.  How you might ask? Hes not telling but it is making him fantastically rich while most have no need to participate in an economy the further out from Sol you are the less available things are and a more traditional economy takes hold coming up with how that would logically work has been a challenge but I think its working so farI think i answered your question in there somewhere,zootopia,d7620fe,1,t5_2y5oo

But there are certain types of systematic prejudice laws banning gay relationships or marriage or not hiring someone because of their race which only serve to put down people who dont have the ability to change things.And yeah BLM is a big can of worms and while I dont agree with  of the things they say or demand some things I very much disagree with its important to remember the police violence against black people that made the movement happen in the first place. This includes one victim who was a yearold kid with a toy gun a fact which was even mentioned by person who made the police call the in first place and neither of the police officers involved were indicted. Im certainly not saying other races dont experience police violence but there are a worrying number of cases against black people where the police involved experience little or no consequences.,zootopia,d7ityk1,3,t5_2y5oo
8911708,0,t1_d7ifjgb,True that the funnies probably are more famous for being mutants than for being snarky but that is mostly tied to Nick and Judy hitting the genetic jackpot. If the funnies get more widespread especially with the funnyhybrids them being mutants might become less common.And if other couples had funnies they also wouldnt be necessarily mutants but also not that snarky either.Frost probably also gets told that they didnt imagine him to become such a father.There have been several comics which make that joke.We can leave it open for a funny date if we want to pair the other funnies.Maybe even Gideon got together with one of Judys sister because there dont seem to be much foxes otherwise.Spring would try her best not to get accused of cheating with her power but with people accusing her even if she does nothing and accidentally using it it would really get frustrating for her.Yeah Spring wouldnt go far but even with Spring suddenly taking a more serious tone and theme it would be intimidating to Kayla whos still just a little child.Sage probably would still cringe if Lena ever reveals that she overheard him even if it was just in her mind.Lena Why did you suddenly cringe like that?Sage Ummm...cramps?Lena Did you snoop around in my head again?Sage What? Me? Never!Not sure if Sage really would be that much intimidated by her size. But it would be fun if she laughs if he voiced that concern to her.Agree that he would trust Flow the most but she would also be the one who has the least advice to give him.Agree that his siblings might tease him that he has girlfriend when he says he talks to a girl online. Especially Jolt and probably saying that it would be impossible for him to get a girlfriend any other way.If Sage notices that he has a crush as the last he might be even more reminded of Flare and afraid of turning into him.Thats a fun dialogue and Flare is so confident and sappy Sage might do a throw up gesture.Flare probably mentions it whenever Kayla is not in earshot or maybe mentions it in a way Kayla doesnt understand.Or when she gets aware of it maybe he talks about it openly.Agree that it would be powerful for Jolt there.It would really show that Jolt still has her insecurities hidden under her tough shell and that Andre is one of the few shes open to in her insecurities.Andre probably would feel rather bad for noticing that Jolt depended on him there but he failed her there.They would take a quieter moment to reconcile.While building on similarities can be quite useful if we go for repeated themes but in a moment like this it could come off as a bit contrived.Not sure if they should make that joke when the families are there.I agree that they should be afraid of people finding about their powers maybe tieing back to their fear as hybrids saying that once before they suffered for being different in that way.We did have also Dusk bullying at the scouts because of his own fear and the other mention that they were bullied themselves.Something simple as getting called weird would be a bit tame unless it was worded more derogatory.,zootopia,d7j22ab,2,t5_2y5oo

8964584,0,t3_531w6l,Ars Moriendi by twocentnuisance.Synopsis taken from my AO description Cities are like oceans. Vast and teeming with life and mysteries. Everything is visible towards the surface. The deeper you go the stranger and more dangerous things become. And something awful has stirred in the dark and cold depths of Zootopia. It is hungry for blood. It has been several months since former mayor Dawn Bellwethers arrest and Officers Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde have risen to the challenge of keeping the city from falling apart. Despite the bright outlook promised at stopping the savage predator plot speciesism both unlawful and lawful continues to further divide the populace. Fear as it turns out has not loosened its stranglehold on the city. It has only tightened its grip. And this fear has kicked awake something monstrous.When a new and very odd murder case falls into their laps the duo jump headlong into the case. Before long the pair realize that their murder investigation reaches far beyond the victim and will have deadly ramifications for the city and for them.Authors note Looking for a solid murder mystery AND slow burn wildehopps AND themes of racism AND fun and exciting slice of life moments AND the first of a series? Its all in the link can ya dig it?,zootopia,d7pep88,6,t5_2y5oo

9687513,0,t1_da75a8j,I really have to admit that seeing ships other than WildeHopps appears to be rather wrong or weird to not put it that negative in my opinion. I just cant see why the hell Judy would fall in love with Gideon and vice versa. Just an example of a ship I know there are way more of them but this one seems to be one of the most controversial. There are just no points in the movie where one could possibly tell that Judy or Nick have a deeper relationship to someone else and this eliminates the every other ship for me personally.Seeing how Judy and Nick treat each other throughout the movie and how it ends its almost safe to say theyre a little bit more than friends or atleast will become that in a sequel. I know the creators wanted to keep everything open and they did... but cmon at some point everyone thought these two would be perfectly cute and fitting as a couple eh? Anyways that said I have to make clear that I dont mind ships not including Nick and Judy. Everything is open there and sometimes its awesome to see with what ideas and thoughts people come up when it comes to possible relationships between background characters. Theyre often even pretty cute and would only make sense.Uhm however that might seem like Im in some kind of denial here but note that its my opinion just like people shipping Judy or Nick with other characters have their own too and thats nice. I mean it contributes to the fandom in the end. But we should really stop hating on that. I have never downvoted another ship just because I didnt like it. It wouldnt make any sense to do so and seeing people telling others to stop posting such content or telling them their opinion is wrong is just cruel. If you dont like what you see why not ignoring it? Wasting your time unsuccessfully convincing others to change their mind doesnt really have any benefits.,zootopia,da76w9k,1,t5_2y5oo

9731689,0,t1_dabk52s,...that doesnt surprise me in the slightest. The Harlequin novels date back to the s and theyve been consistent money makers throughout that time. Sex has always sold...but it really sucks when a good story gets sidetracked by it IMO. Youre in the clear BTW. Back in high school my friends and I developed the Harlequin test for books. If you randomly open up a book to a page  times and if on each page sex is either being performed or described the book fails. The Fox and the Rabbit does not fail this test....Hamiltons books started failing the test after Narcissus.Once again with Hamilton I remember just shaking my head in the book store when her Gentry series started up. Just from reading the book flap it was obvious that the whole narrative revolved around having the main protagonist have nearly constant sex with multiple partners...and maybe an occasional plot line that has them leave the bedroom.Im probably exaggerating...but not by much Id wager. ,zootopia,dacn5sm,2,t5_2y5oo

Premise by ubiohazarddallasFeaturing cover art by TheWyvernsWeavergtThe ZPD realizes that in the wake of the Nighthowler crisis the patterns of crime in a very seedy part of town begin to change. Judy and Nick are swallowed up in the mystery and end up entwined very deeply in something that they dont fully understand. Nicks instincts and Judys smarts are the only weapons they have to get out but will it be enough? Or will a madmans plots and conspiracies eventually consume the city and them with it?Just updated it with chapter  today. really starting to get the hang of it im excited to keep going.

10014030,0,t1_dbcqoeb,Of course an extremely small amount of actual humans would go through with any kind of animal relations its already physically disgusting aside from all the ethical issues. The furry fandom is a good example of what Im talking about a sizeable subset of humans who find attraction in the aesthetic of certain animals as far as I know most commonly mammals could be wrong. So for my theory its more appropriate to say that humans are just attracted to everything even ignoring furries just look at how deep the rabbit hole goes with fetishes So the big difference here is all the animals are now on even footing intellectually so there goes the comparative humananimal ethics issues.

10862471,0,t1_ddmn7kr,gt First if they manage to run out of their sources of food like that I doubt that any prey population might be able to sustain them.All predators in nature eventually run out their source of food its all cyclic. The predator population then drops prey populations recover then predator population booms again due to availability of prey and the cycle stars again. So long as there is no complete extinction you can have chaotic cycles like that that will continue in a stable way for long periods of time. Thats what happens in nature today. Whats different in our case is the intelligence of most members of the food chain.gtNot really we already got that farming insects requires just very basic tools that if you got a bit more advanced than using simple spears you could do that. Having ceramic would do the trick.I understand that and Im not saying insect farming cantwont work but going from a predator merely eating all the prey it can get its paws on to an industrious insectfarming community with ceramic tools foraging groups to gather food for the insects and providing a protein output large enough to sustain said predator population so they dont need to ever rely on meat is a really huge leap. Sure it will happen over time eventually but its going to be a gradual thing.And during that time it may become harder and harder to eat sentient prey but it will still happen just with declining frequency.gtSorry but that makes little sense. Obviously you have to constantly devote resources to it but also as obviously you get only a constant source of food while hunting is an onetime effort that only gives only one time food.Say one burrow of rabbits develops the spear. Predators can still go around attacking all the other burrows that dont have the spear. Eventually either other burrows will learn of the spear and copy it or  that one spearwielding burrow will have a population explosion and take over all the other lands in the area.Now predators have to contend with spearwielding rabbits.Suppose a group of predators find they can neutralize the spear by wielding a large club. That group of predators can now safely attack any rabbit burrow they want. That one technological breakthrough allows them to go from attacking none of the say  rabbit burrows in their territory to attacking all of them safely.Eventually some rabbits will develop a countermeasure to the large club say bow and arrow. Now predators can attack all rabbit burrows safely except the one with bows and arrows. The scenario will repeat with either nonarrow bunnies dying out or copying the arrow technology. Eventually preds have no burrows they can attack safely. Until the point the preds develop armour to defend against arrows then they go again from  burrows they can attack to all of them.Do you understand what I mean here? Develop the club or the shield once and you go from  rabbit burrows to attack to . HUGE increase in resources with one technological breakthrough and it will remain that way until the bunnies are all dead or all develop some way to counter the preds club. One breakthrough will make a big difference.gtAnd then prey develop the throw the spear technology and as soon as you are in throwing range of a prey you are dead.Most prey tend to be smaller than preds and thick fur makes for adequate defense against smaller projectiles. You do have a point but I think you might be underestimating the impact different sizes would have in this arms race.gtFirst if predators actually would consider still hunting prey that would be a good reason to develop better weapons. And as all technology gets further developed it would so go for most things like weapons. Especially as there probably are still regular wars that would require that.Just to know at what point in history are we at to consider wars? Wars imply large groups united by some kind of common rule or law. I was thinking more in terms of tribal stage where you had isolated groups of prey living out their life in a smaller territory with roving bands of predators travelling large distances to attack many isolated groups of prey. Wars would mean that preds have gone sedentary populations of prey can come together and fight off a common enemy. Am I missing something here?gtTheres a difference between slavery and livestock. Slavery served an entire different purpose and they had to deal with totally different problems.True that. Assuming chickens are nonsentient then raising chickens would be far more efficient and simple. If everything from reptiles to birds are sentient however preds are going to have no choice but to either hunt or raise preys until they can get their proteins costeffectively from some other source.gtIt might be very unlikely to happen as a numerically superior force wouldnt need many weapons to overthrow a numerically smaller force.Again thats assuming that these forces are similar in every other respect and its just not true in Zootopiaverse. Preds are larger stronger sometimes faster have claws and teeth and have predatory instincts. Most prey have the instinct to run. Most casualties in medieval warfare were inflicted during routs and if a numerically smaller force of larger stronger predators can close in with a numerically superior force of prey but make them turn tail and flee it doesnt really matter how much preds are outnumbered.Besides Napoleon used a numerically smaller but far more mobile force to great effect gtThere is no predator that has to subsist on a pure mammal diet. And if lone predators attacked lone prey it would be even less energy efficient then large raiding parties who are still inefficient.Fair enough.gtThats actually a good question and there are many ways to go with it. Instincts could be the reason for some mammals to not get along like you said with bunnies and foxes who are natural enemies.Definitely a topic I love to explore. Like I said earlier I am not a fan of universes where Zootopian animals are merely humanswearinganimalskins. Sure animals have humanlevel intelligence societies and cities but the more different from humans the inhabitants of Zootopia are the more interesting it gets.,zootopia,de0dy8e,1,t5_2y5oo

What was particularly puzzling is that there was usually no effort on the part of the reviewer to consider alternative interpretations. That might be because the psychological phenomena portrayed are not as recognizable unless you have some background in the field. Or it could be because most viewers only see the film once and jump to the interpretation thats most apparent to them I did not start to piece together this psychological characterdriven message until my third viewing.,zootopia,dey1qw2,2,t5_2y5oo
