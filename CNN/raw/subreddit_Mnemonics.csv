For example when i first started learning Loci i would place one item per room. After A LOT of practice i can now store things on the door knob to my room the light switches  things across one wall length. I cant explain why it happens but the more you practice the easier it becomes to store more things in less space. of course use the most FAMILIAR places as journeys. For history id think about separating different time periods by rooms or different events and all the effects they had in one room to keep things organized and easy to distinguish. ,Mnemonics,cuyr98k,1,t5_2rksx
