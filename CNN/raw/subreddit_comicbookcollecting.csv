6699218,0,t3_47dtlo,I got my CGC verified Stan Lee signature on my comic from Calgary.  There should be representation there.  When I got it it was next to Stans autograph table so you avoid the line and get the autograph anyway.  The line was crazy the last time as I recall.  So get there early if you plan to wait in line.That autograph was  each if I recall so choose what books you want to sign wisely and base on your budget.What to get autographed depends on your collection and possibly a favorite Marvel comic you have.  A key issue that Stan actually wrote might be a good investment like early FF Spiderman Xmen etc. Getting Stans autograph certified by CGC might cost an extra    bucks depending on what you decide with the CGC rep.

Its called being retarded. Obviously there is an over supply for the demand and you would need to list it lower to get to sold.

7677208,0,t3_4jwch8,Basically if theyre still in print not very much. Used trades dont go up in value the same way actual comics do because the idea is that people are buying them to read. Aside from things like the Marvel Masterworks collection or something thats no longer able to be purchased you should probably be looking at around  of what you paid. If youre going to try and sell them to a store... maybe about  of what you paid.,comicbookcollecting,d3euq19,1,t5_2xxis
