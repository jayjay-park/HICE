5680427,0,t1_cx16t8c,Oh huh. Sorry my mistake. Anyways I think theres a table of enemies in the game data. It lists em by name.Not sure if thats what it uses for the random encounter list. Have you looked for a list of enemies grouped by area?Id suggest control  Fing looking for a certain enemy and seeing if theres a table separated by area.,Underminers,cx17oi6,1,t5_3a5jm

5742025,0,t3_3tov6z,Ive found that the addresses for some variables may be offset by  bytes upon starting the game. So if these addresses ever end up not working try  bytes forward or backward.Also in case you want to play around with more variables try modifying values every xth th byte away from a known address. E.g. if you know xDBA is a variable try xDBAA and xDBAC as well. All the variables are doubles even when it doesnt make sense.,Underminers,cx8uqvy,2,t5_3a5jm

5929542,0,t3_3wkkud,This post is way outside of the subs scope. I get that there arent many subs out there but this sub is all about analyzing whats already in the game not creating whole new content. If you want to do some form of fan mod your best option is to search for game maker studio decompiler. If you find and use one it will give you the source code of the game.You really would need some form of technical skill. If you work solo you can take as much time as you need to figure it out and tinker with it every now and then. Working solo would remove virtually all pressure and could be a great way to build up some skill.Bear in mind if your project has any real amount of scope you are responsible for keeping it legal including the research to even know where those lines are..If you formally start a project message me and we can definitely have an announcement post or something similar in the sub.,Underminers,cxww78d,1,t5_3a5jm

8284403,0,t3_4suwvs,Well that music is the opening of Metal Crusher albeit basic and slow. That connects narratively to Mettaton Alphys and the lab area. Semi is both a typeface and a category of typefaces and Grandpa fits better with the skeletal bros than with the other major family in the game the effectivelyimmortal goats. A senior skeletal man associated with the labs and Alphys certainly suggests that Grandpa Semi is an old development name for Gaster  or possibly even his surname  as does the calls placement with the other funFun events. The fact its now been assigned to Temmie suggests Toby just considers it a joke now.,Underminers,d5d3y6b,6,t5_3a5jm
