894867,0,t1_ch5zl93,I feel that if we make a distinction of words well all be more prone to actively try to differentiate between f waves and artifact which can be tricky sometimes.Im glad my atrocious paint skills helped out PIn my case I was viewing it on my phone and had to really zoom it to see anything but seeing the image in the imgur page youd have to be a hawk. If we were holding the actual paper wed all see it immediately too.,EKGs,ch6015q,1,t5_2y8yl

5051247,0,t1_cuttijt,Some other users already conmented on the Q T and the negative qrs anteriorly and they made some educated guesses as to the significance. Id say they are non specific abnormalities so can only judge the significance knowing the clinical context,EKGs,cuuv7oi,1,t5_2y8yl

8170153,0,t1_d4yrvkq,Yeah I agree the morphology is a little bit different but I would expect to see a difference in width mainly. The P waves are buried in the T wave so it might be impossible to actually see a P wave  you just have to trust that it is within the T wave.I am no expert by any standard though. ,EKGs,d4yth4i,1,t5_2y8yl

10269318,0,t1_dc7xhv3,Thank you very much for the reply. So in my case even though they note some abnormalities its still not abnormal or risky because it falls within the range of how healthy patients show up on these tests? I.e. some minor abnormalities are normal no big deal and not likely to develop into something dangerous? Any suggested follow up questions for my doc? Next appointment is in one month. ,EKGs,dc830ht,0,t5_2y8yl
