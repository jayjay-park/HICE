730268,0,t3_22j28z,In the Zero Sum game no nation can rise peacefully.USs rise was at the expense of the British and European Empires which rose at the expense of Africa and Asia.The British was inevitably led to give up its former sphere of influence because it was simply too expensive to maintain it.Now the same question dilemma is upon US and Japan as Chinas growth is effectively reclaiming its former sphere of influence.But the need of US to confront China in its own backyard is not only nationalistic but also shortsighted.Geopolitics is no longer the same game as it was.Global trade has made it possible for China to extend influences around the world without the need for military expansion.And thats the missed point  US in eagerly confronting containing China in Asia is forcing China to expand its influences more rapidly in Africa and Latin America eating away at USs dominance in other parts of the world.This is less of a conscious plan than an inevitable response.,japannews,cgnaa6u,1,t5_2w9jc
