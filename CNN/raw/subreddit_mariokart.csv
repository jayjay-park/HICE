1256744,0,t3_28gwot,I just thought of a possibility you didnt mention after i saw you say the rankings were between kk. Could they have been friends and queued together? It is possible to play with friends and play with your own little truce so you both place better. The goal could be to finish  and the second place guy could be furthering the distance between them and the pack. Personally I think its more fun to take a dump of items on your friend but if youre grinding for rank working together seems like an easyobvious method to expedite that.I play with similar ranks often and I swear this has happened to me as well. Or at least there is no other explanation to this apparent truce that I can think of.This doesnt apply to your scenario  but I have also noticed that if I am the sole high ranked queued with a bunch of low ranked and get first a few times in a row people will start actively targeting me bowser is large target. Ive been debating switching my Mii to heavy so I can play and hide my weightbe less conspicuous.

You barely make anything for winning and if you dont win you can expect to lose a lot. Ive made nothing but  to  points since playing for getting st and I keep losing well over that anytime I dont win. So it completely defeats the purpose of even winning or trying to gain a higher rating when you lose double or triple that just for placing in the middle not even last.As I said it was rare period finding rooms with nothing but high VR players. If you think that is bad I saw someone lose  points today for just placing in th just because he was k like me at this rate that wont be the case.

1772510,0,t1_ck2g8ps,They wont stay higher than what their skill allows them to. If theyre able to stay at  rating they would also be able to gain  rating from scratch. Thats the whole point of the system. To take an example. There are two players who have the exact same skill  rating but because of the old system one has  rating the other has . Their skill is static and to keep it simple they both race against players with an average rating and skill of  the numbers doesnt really matter but this is just to make it simple. Both player A and player B should because they have the same skill get an average of th place. Player A who has  points will gain points from getting th place because getting an average placement in a race where you have below average rating will gain you points. Player B who has a rating of  will lose points from getting th place because getting an average placement when you have above average rating will lose you points.,mariokart,ck2kw5m,8,t5_2s9ql

3488542,0,t3_305lty,Wall of text warning. MKW gt MK gt MK gt MKDD gtgt SMK gtgtgt MK. MKWii. For one I put over  hours into it with the majority of that being Time Trials. The controls felt great since I was able to weave between bananas with a fat kart with no issue from the very beginning. Online play definitely helped a lot. Along with great track variety. Shortcuts are everywhere with some being high risk high reward. Then theres the creative use of hopping for shroomless shortcuts. MK. Granted I grew up playing this one. But it feels way faster than any other MK to me. Like Im driving so fast that the scenery is a blur type of feeling. Tracks had a lot of variety. Want something simple and fast? Luigi Raceway. Something longer and technical? Royal Raceway. Fast and technical? Mario Raceway. That is no single track feels the same as another. I have to talk about shortcuts too. And how some turns are faster if you hop offroad.Worst MK. Now this might surprise some people. But it really comes down how Nintendo designed the game this time. The game mechanics are mostly fine. Except for the accident that is firehopping. Initially I thought firehopping would be good for the game but all it turned out to be was tedious work for slightly more speed. Though it did enable some cool shortcuts. But speaking of shortcuts there are no really creative shortcuts. And any attempt to find one was promptly blocked by Lakitu. Now looking away from mechanics track design was pretty mediocre. The difference between the shortest and longest tracks is a mere  seconds. Which makes my mind unconsciously believe all the tracks feel the same. Sure the tracks are pretty and nice to look at but theyre not fun to play outside of  courses. MW rRRy dYC. Back to mechanics since I forgot some things I want to gripe about. First the physics. If I hit a wall I expect something to happen. Be it bouncing off or grinding to a halt. But in MK hitting a wall is hilariously inconsistent. With a wide angle you bounce and go on as normal. With a sharp angle you might get turned completely around or just get stopped. Next gliders. Gliders this time are complete crap. You have barely any control and they dont lead into any potential shortcuts. Finally saving the worst offender for last items. The ability to hold only  item makes for super defensive gameplay. In first place placing banana traps is a horrible choice. The banana disappears after  laps anyway. Drop it lap  pass it lap  gone lap  even if no one hit it. Gone are the days of trap filled tracks. Even more so if first place is far ahead since everyone else ends up only getting mushrooms. Honestly unless the next dlc introduces . minute tracks MK will remain my lowest ranked MK.,mariokart,cppx3c0,6,t5_2s9ql

Or Bunny Hopping on Quake Style FPS or glitches  skips on Speedrunning  There are even categories that accept forbid certain glitches but usually almost all glitches are allowed  denying creeps creep pulling neutral stacking on Dota .Couldnt Nintendo patch Fire Hopping out if they thought it was cheating?At least on Dota  they patched some glitches out so they are clear what they want on the game and what they dont.Well I respect your opinion anyways.,mariokart,cqhrpwi,5,t5_2s9ql

The first section you go forward towards the end then you sharp hairpin turnaround or instateleport to go backwards on the same oneway path where you may collide with racers behind or ahead going in the opposite direction. The shorter the time to cross a single section andor the narrower the path that nice sweetspot to run into opposing racers often enough without being ridiculously over the top the better.
