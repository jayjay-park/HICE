I compared the climate to the real world climate and found a fairly common fruit which was used a lot in ancient practices. I especially like the ability to ferment it into a brandy type drink  which seems appropriate to my people.Past that as far as my neighbors techGlueWhat on earth are they boiling them for?The herders of the Antemuri and the Manthai have lived near one another for many years and the extraordinarily odd practices of the latter have piqued curiosity on more than one occasion. While peeing on piles of rags is odd and living in tents is quaint boiling donkey hooves seems downright insane enough to ask about. Once discovered glue is a difficult thing to contain.RawhideIll give you this spear for those shoes and that donkey if you tell me how you made themThe usefulness of rawhide is often overlooked  but not by those who are wearing plantfiber slippers. The strength of the material and its ability to set into nearly any shape make it a highly sought after commodity. In turn the relative ease by which it is made makes it a hard to keep secret.

Hey he thought They have teff too.. he smiled and sat down to stop the spinning in his head.All of a sudden the whole crew is startled by a conch shell blowing through the village. This was their queue back in Anabi that a large fleet was returning back home or something big was happening in town. This woke them up entirely and they were now aware of the mudbrick buildings decoration. There were many similar symbols of their Tuma mostly but Eni Damgani DurKazul could be seen as well. These were not exact copies but quite similar indeed. It seemed the entire village was getting ready for some sort of big event but the only words they could understand were leader and Tumak.

It probably does not help that he initially expected to receive new arms for his men and not foreign mercenaries who would expect more supplies.  First it is not for you outsiders to decide what I will do with my subjects.  I intend to rule in a way that will be pleasing to Adad of course but it is perhaps too bold for you to advise me in matters of rulership while I have granted you an audience in my own reception hall.  The Baal paused for several seconds to ensure this assertion would sink in.  Anyway given that I plan to fight a defensive warif a war at allit will not be necessary to give you every detail about our land assuming I decide to hire you at all.  That said the ground falls somewhat in height as one ventures north and east of this citys limits and so we will at least have that advantage whenever Uraak decides it is time to strike.  Your offer too is bold especially considering I have little information about your alleged martial prowess or your weapons.  I have drillyards established so that this citys farmers and baluherders can train with spears and slings.  I would see some type of demonstration out there before I even consider your offer otherwise your wordsand attitudeare nothing more than hot air.  That is if you are still willing.  I will tell you this much should you choose to enlist in this conflict you will be standing against a city that has at least three men for every two living in Eshunand thats only in Uraak itself.

Similarly to how trade with the Malaran worked. She also understood that the men meant to say that they came from the sea which meant it would be hard to set up consistent trade routes especially since the envoys that had arrived earlier had told her that the Kwahadi canoes are primitive compared to the foreigners boats.She tried to make clear that it would be best to try to learn each others languages before discussing the details but they could fill their ships with whatever they wanted from the Kwahadi lands to show their leaders back home.,DawnPowers,cyeakc8,1,t5_3a9s6

6278366,0,t3_41lbwz,The young man was apparently no stranger to the back of a camel or a saddle. While he was nowhere near the cavalier that these nomads were he managed not to embarrass himself. He was very high strung stuffy and nothing like the good natured old man at the beach. Dran was possessed of a singular purpose  learning their language and asking as many questions as possible.It soon became clear that the man had a gift for learning. Indeed his questions quickly left the realm of pointing at random objects. He began to ask about verbs possessives pronouns and simple tenses. Indeed he even seemed practiced in how to ask these types of questions.Yet he was not a savant so it still took quite a while for him to absorb what he needed to most of the while he simply drilled questions into those around him. The daily ritual seemed to bring the man out of his shell. As often as he was allowed to participate the more open he seemed to become. He was quick to learn the word priest and different variations to it. Further it soon became evident that religion was a topic which was very close to his heart but he lacked the finesse to discuss it with any subtlety. This would lead to questions about the nomads deity which became more and more specific until Dran lacked the words to continue and he became a bit frustrated. This in turn led him to continue the lessons.Beyond the rituals the only time he seemed to drop his shoulders and relax was when he was drinking. From the behavior of the man on the beach and Drans example it should not strike any observer that these people liked to drink. At night after a decent amount of fermented camel milk Dran would point to the sky and begin naming stars constellations angels and hidden monsters. They were rare moments of wideeyed youth and exuberance from the teen. He seemed full of an immense love that just spilled out of his eyes. At the slightest provocation he would talk of distant lands over the sea of men who cut off their own fingers to prove they were brave and of women who owned fleets of ships that rivaled any mans. Granted most of this did not translate but the young mans energy was contagious. At night went talking about the gods and men it became evident why such a young man was out here with the nomads. That is until he began to slur and went to sleep.Upon reaching the well Dran nodded. Bring fresh water back. he held up one of the stoneware clay urns. He dismounted led his camel to the well then paused. He looked to Chaya and then stepped back. Maam or whatever honorific they used for women Dran drew some water filled an empty gourd and brought it to her.   ,DawnPowers,cz3a2r9,1,t5_3a9s6

6572986,0,t1_czz1cw9,Youve got a good point with the military techs I was thinking that the threat of war would have the Andai send weaponsmiths to the Ongin to study their weaponry and armour then having them adapted by the weaponsmiths to make them seem smarter and more skillful. That would be with the dory spearI had a major brain slip sorry helmets linothorax and shield. Then as guards of the Jhoghatai practice with the spearshield combo realize that the slashing action of the machete isnt useful and create a stabbing version of the machete for close combat.These shields arent too big with them being . metres tall and only two feet wide at their widest. Them being based off the aspis used by the Ongin and actually being smaller as an easier design to construct out of wood.For the formations I was going to use a slave revolt to introduce themas the formations are very useful against a numerically superior but poorly disciplined and equipped foe one which Im a bit behind on writing.I have machetes as my prior sword and these would still be very primitive gladius basically being machetes designed for stabbing.

However there isnt too much wind and it doesnt seem as if theres any lightning so all the rain does is make everyone wet and miserable. There isnt overly much in the way of shelter this is uninhabited land and the forests of the south are rapidly thinning into sparse but broad trees that provide some protection from the rain. After two hours of slogging through this mess the rain itself finally stops which is a great relief to the crew. However the ground is still sodden and the going is slow. The sleds are remarkably helpful here sliding over the soggy grassland with relative ease but the camels seem to be struggling to keep up. After a while the group makes camp for the night using the trees as cover along with other materials theyve brought with them.The days pass in this way for some time. Travel hunt rest. The rain continues periodically as it is the savannas wet season. After about ten days of uneventful travel the group guesses they are about halfway to Murtavirian lands.

Eventually they were ferried to EpoKaan the capital in a grand convoy of wagons puled by a series oflonghorned white cattle In the city the diplomats were paraded through the streets through the western gate and towards the centre of the city where both the grand temple to Lei stood aswell as the Mandar hall These temples stood as a testament to the prosperity of both the nation and its people. To both sides of the convoy grand houses stood holding the elite of the Federation. As they were pulled deeper into the city they were approached by several men dressed in a range of clothes but all dressing in full headwear these head garbs ranged from simple designs to much more intricate ornate designs. It was explained that these men were merchants merely tying to peddle their wares to the foreigners. Soon enough however they reached the grand hall of the Mandar. On either side of the building construction was taking place. The intricate net of scaffolding adding to the grandness of the building. Inside they were greeted with a series of corridors seemingly stretching on forever. However they were quickly ushered into a room of grand proportion all around them stood a council of men with one man sitting on a large chair in the center. It was here their guides left them. The man in the centre wore simple clothing relative to his council either side. However his head dress stood out significantly. A large piece of material encrusted with jewels and precious metals. As he rose to address the foreigners the entirety of the assembly stood aswell. It was only after he waved his hand they sat down.He spoke with great deliberateness and authority. It was clear he was in charge for a reason.Greetings friends. You must be the.. Teketa? correct? I have been awaiting your arrival for sometime. I am Ranjan the Garrum Zefar. representative of the Zefarri people within the Mandar I am sure you know why you have been summoned and I must say I thank you for coming such a distance. I am not too fond of ocean voyages myself and could not imagine coming such a distance. You will have the best accommodation we can provide until you leave. I encourage you to explore our great city as the celebration and the feast will be held tomorrow. But until then I welcome you to EpoKaan capital of the Zefar Mandar,DawnPowers,d129j6k,2,t5_3a9s6
