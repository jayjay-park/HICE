8427071,0,t3_4v2i8e,Canadian using the Robin on Wind here. To answer your first question it depends on what youre using it for. If youre gonna play games a lot its gonna drain in about  or  hours if it was fully charged. If youre not gonna play games it might last the entire day? sorry thats kind of a guess since I play games on the Robin everydayI cant answer the second one since Ive only had it for about a month. For the third question theres not a lot of problems. The only one Ive encountered is that after I tilt my phone upwards after putting it in battery saver Im unable to interact with the app so I restart it. As for the price it cost just under  including tax. I didnt have to pay for shipping I think. Since youre using wind Im assuming you live in the gta so it should cost the same as mine. It took them about  days to ship it to me. I hope you get the Robin. Its a good phone for a good price. I think youll love it. ,Nextbit,d5uxblr,1,t5_398me

9497881,0,t3_5av9wa,This is a thing with all Android phones. Im pretty sure Google made this mandatory when you unlock the bootloader pretty recently with Marshmallow or shortly after but Im not  sure. For about a year though this has been a thing when you unlock the bootloader on a phone with firmware that isnt outdated. ,Nextbit,d9jtdwj,8,t5_398me

10199994,0,t3_5m23rk,The phone is actually pretty brittle. It will bend or break under a surprisingly small amount of strain so I really would recommend a case. I got a Tudia one that seems to give it a little more backbone and it hardly increases the size at all. The phone certainly doesnt seem bulky with it. The case actually makes the volume buttons easier to use too which is a nice little plus. If you do decide to go without a case just know that the phone is quite fragile so youll need to be extra careful with it.,Nextbit,dc085l3,2,t5_398me
