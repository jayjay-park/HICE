4608452,0,t3_3e13q8,Have you looked into consulting with an engineering firm or just in general? Some of my friends work on engineeringish problems do a lot of problem solving and such but they have an MBA and a nonengineering degree. If you want to go the MBA route I would start applying to jobs in whatever engineering field youre interested in or as close as you can get even if its just an internship for a semester while youre still a student. Then decide if you want to spend the money to finish grad school or go for an MBA instead. ,Engineers,ctbh922,1,t5_2rq25
8539625,0,t3_4wq6an,clickbait. the article is based on conjecture and supposition with no evidence that the applicant was rejected because they were female.  This pertains to technician jobs not engineering jobs. The author somehow assumes their engineering degree makes them qualified to be a technician. Hint It doesnt. The article is based on supposition and conjunction not hard facts. The author is making assumptions about why they didnt get an interview with little basis in reality. Based on feedback i have concluded. if any recruiter gave feedback that even remotely hinted at because you were female or likely to give birth for why you didnt get the interview they would be fired on the spot. that is illegal. I work in the field of engineering the people i work with dont give two shits about the color of your skin or the type of gentiles you have. all we give a shit about are you going to  get your work done and not totally fuck it up not endanger lives,Engineers,d690rc7,4,t5_2rq25
