It is  in the US right now.  Elijah is really only slightly less popular at .  So if you want to avoid popular names you might want to avoid Elijah as well.  Another option might be to keep William as a first name but call your son something else.  This is a thing in my family. So many men are named Robert as a first name that they just go by their middle name.  It is a way to name your kid a family name that you dont love or that is overused without having to hear it every day.,namenerds,ckxn518,6,t5_2xmrc

Or I could see it sounding like Kale like the last syllable in Mikhail.  In my opinion the issue with pronunciation is bigger than the names just being very uncommon. For Chael at least youd have to accept the need to correct people on the pronunciation all the time.

So while Emily Olivia and Owen sound great together there is something about having two kids sharing the O and the other kid being left out that irks me. This is totally my own quirk though and the names flow really well together otherwise.Something else you may want to consider is naming him after a greatgrandfather since thats what youve done for your daughters.Other names that are similar in style to OwenLincolnEmilyOlivia if youre interested Jackson  Benjamin  Ross  Henry  Quentin  James  Vaughn Jasper Dexter Colin Logan Max Miles Samuel,namenerds,crr5e0x,1,t5_2xmrc

4194067,0,t1_cry9s7h,I dont think thats quite fair. First off I dont think its fair to say DeKalb is just absurd its a notuncommon family as well as citycounty name which means in the South its a not unheardof given name of which Ive known several. Its not a common name by any stretch but its not fair to call it absurd especially for the region in which OP lives.Second OP says his given name is an unanglicized Irish name if youve gone  years as Saoirse or Caoimhe switching to Michael or John might not feel right. Peoples first assumption when you have a strange name isnt that you changed it. A unisex name probably wont be the difference between passing and not passing and like OP said its easier for a family who still thinks of you as their daughter to start calling you Shiloh than Jethro. I dont think Remy is genderneutral for a  year old. A small child moreso but its just a trend and applies differently to different age groups. yearold Remys are girls. That being said Id avoid Remy because its starting to get popular and same with Rory. Theyre soft masculine and theyre trending which means a lot of other trans people are going to chose them. Certainly for most of the population Aiden and its derivatives are just tootrendy baby names but in the circles that pay attention to such things theyve also become stereotypical trans guy names. Rory and Remy have the potential to do the same so Id avoid them for that reason.,namenerds,crybl42,3,t5_2xmrc

Hes so funny! You and him the other my names should start a club or a gang or something! Every time. Teachers would even comment and joke cause it was a trendy name not a classic name so it was notable to have five of us unlike having five Johns or Davids. I really hated it I felt like because of my name people judged me based on the other people with my name Why arent you as talkative as the other my name? people assuming I was into sports because one of the others was etc. and it was so frustrating.Ive since changed my name not because of a vendetta against the old one at least not entirely to something I dont know anyone else with and I much prefer it.

But if its your name and youre proud of by all means correct the transliteration.. Simon interests me because Ive know Korean men called Simon as a western name. I guess the sound of it must be appealing in Korean? Its a nice name just slightly unusual these days.. Wouldnt think of Psy in a million years. Still there are worse associations.  I knew a Korean guy who had to go by his initials M B Surname because it turned out his name was Moon Bum..

I actually know of only one other woman who has done this.Most women I know have adopted their husbands surname regardless of which number marriage it is.  I do know one person who kept her maiden name during both her first marriage and her second.

6567983,0,t1_czyn0ey,gtIn the UK Frankie is currently being given to three times as many boys as girls so boys still have that as an option at least.Well yes my point was that Logan and Frankie are overwhelmingly male names but are still considered cool for girls there are no overwhelmingly feminine names that are considered cool for boys.Its because while women have gained the right to do traditionally male things femininity remains very much considered inferior. So its considered degrading for boys to be feminine but for girls to be masculine is cool. Names go from male to female and not the other way around because of parents trying to poach the prestige of masculinity for their daughters but of course it doesnt work because once names become associated with girls they are seen as feminine and lose their cool luster and are therefore tainted for boys. It wont change unless people start challenging it from both directions though.,namenerds,czyomho,3,t5_2xmrc

Very similar to SarahSara though so yeah I can see a lot of misinterpretations.Blair  has a pretty unappealing sound for a girl in general. Bleah with a random R at the end if you have a rhotic accent. If it must be used use it on a boy.Meredith  is interesting not a name you hear often. I think itd fit in well alongside the vintage revivals of today  it actually peaked in the s and s but it sure as hell doesnt feel like a name from that era.Elowen twentyfive births is cool and not that hard to pronounce. Its part of the insanely trendy el family though. Elowen itself is one of the rarest names in that category but its upwards curve bears a distinct resemblance to a straight line. At twentyfive births its debatable whether thats something to worry about.Of your list I strongly recommend Meredith or Elowen.What I can glean of your style from that is that youre into rare yet recognizable names preferably ones with weight and histories behind them. Blair Meredith and Elowen are from the British Isles but Sura is Arabic so theres some room for etymological variance. Meredith and Elowen in particular have mythological magical vibes to them.Meredith Fae  Meredith Eden  Meredith Blythe  Meredith Tanis  Meredith Eve  Meredith Aura  Meredith True  Meredith HopeElowen Sun  Elowen Faun  Elowen Belle  Elowen Mercy  Elowen Jill  Elowen Pilar  Elowen Lil  Elowen Love,namenerds,d0jbv91,1,t5_2xmrc

7200504,0,t3_4e3492,I love a lot of virtue names but some of them just arent good. My favorites are Merit Prosper Amity and Grace. I like Mercy too but it reminds me too much of begging for Mercy which isnt great. Verity Hope and Joy are nice as well but not my personal style. I agree with your dislike list Id also add Charity and Trinity to that.Its hard to put into words what makes a good virtue name and what makes a bad one. I think a lot of the better virtue names are also better virtues. For example Prudence Patience and Chastity are all virtues that involve restraint not doing something not doing dangerous things not getting angry not having sex. Prosper Joy and Merit have more... room. Theyre about doing something thriving being happy being excellent and theyre not as specific. Of course that example doesnt apply to absolutely every virtue name but its a pattern I noticed. In general virtue names arent good or bad.

She isnt exactly a positive character to name someone after. I wouldnt say its stupid but when she grows up and wants to know why she was called Azula... shes going to want to know why it was that character and perhaps not Katara. I mean sure your literal only reason for naming her Azula is that you love the name but names are linked to things. Not to mention as someone else has already that Avatar is not a flash in the pan thing. I personally have a friend who is waiting for her two year old to get a little older before she shows them the DVDs of the show.

Ada Lovelace is a bit too much.There are too many great scientists to take names from and we could be here all day listing them off. My favourite has to be Feynman. Bit Richard is a very boring first name. Feynman might make a decent middle name separate from Richard. But it suffers from the same over the top thing. So Id not recommend it.As for science names well that well is even deeper than scientist names. We seem love giving really great names to stars and galaxies and such especially.

Lovelace is sometimes used as a first name too.Its not as common as it used to be to give a kid a complete name of someone else but it didnt used to be as common to give kids middle names at all.  I like a lot of the earlier comments suggestions for other middle names Irene Spence Rosalind but ultimately it sounds like your real problem is getting your husband to like anything.  I dont think that Ada Lovelace is a bad name to agree on. Its pretty it has a great story and its a middle nameyou wont be using it o a daily basis.

8988744,0,t3_53dixk,I love the Casson family names! That series was really beautiful I think Indigos Star was my favourite.Thanks for reminding me of them!Books definitely contributed to my love of names. Kelley Armstrong is great at choosing names that suit her characters but I especially love Elena Hope and Lucas.Christine Feehan has a great collection of names too including Mikhail which I love Desiree Shea and Raven.Trudi Canavans Dark Magician trilogy introduced Sonea which is lovely and then theres Garth Nix who wrote Sabriel. I think its obvious that that name spoke to me Edit Just remembered Jeremy from Kelley Armstrong a name I used to really dislike but now love because the character is wonderful.

Are you blown away by their names? Theyre just ok? You wouldnt name your kid after them? So why are they judging their granddaughterniece? Stick with Rosalie if you like it. I do.The first name that popped into my head after seeing James but not allowing Jamie was Jane. Julia was second. Others have mentioned Jasmine.You may also consider how her first name rolls into her middle name whatever that may be. So while Rosalie is a very pretty name how will it be in addition to the Chinese name? Or any of these names on your list? Or are you undecided on the middle name until you find the first name?These are some female names of my friends family coworkers etc that I think are nice somewhat unique but not crazy.

9320554,0,t1_d8x5imc,I agree with your general sentiment that people go too far with trying to be unique. However I also understand the importance of trying to avoid popular names. Names that seem somewhat familiar based on ranking can appear rare in raw numbers. However its important to remember that that can be misleading also. For one thing when you add up variants of a name due to alternate spellings or slight but unimportant variations in pronunciation things can look really different. A name that seems rare in raw numbers can actually be somewhat common with all its variant spellings and pronunciations. Also theres huge sociogeographic variation so those low numbers are often concentrated. It doesnt matter if its  kids nationally it matters if its  of the kids you are likely to run into which is probably the case because likes are similar to likes. Part of the reason why there hasnt been dominant names recently like in the past too is because people are emphasizing uniqueness. So theres a catch in that regard.Id also argue that names are special when talking about popularity in that theres a functional benefit to uniqueness over commonness names are supposed to be identifying. So if everyone had a unique name we might complain about parents egos or whatever but the names would be doing their job functionally speaking. I agree that I wish people would balance uniqueness against other considerations more but Id probably rather have the current situation than the opposite. ,namenerds,d8xg5tk,8,t5_2xmrc

9479389,0,t3_58bhg0,I will hopefully be facing exactly this.  Ive loved the name Rose since I was a kid.  My cousin and I were fairly close have talked about baby names since we were about  years old.  She knows I love Rose and absolutely plan to use it in some form first or middle if I ever have a daughter.  Ive been dealing with infertility for  years now so no kids yet but she had a baby girl recently.  Her daughters middle name is Rose.  My cousin likes the name a lot and its a shortened version of a relatives name on her husbands side.  We talked about it both well before the baby was born and even discussed it before she was pregnant and are in agreement that if I ever finally have a baby girl her name will still contain Rose.  We think the girls would enjoy having that connection to each other and why should I give up my lifelong favorite?  I would have had a baby girl named Rose  years ago if my body cooperated.  By the same token it would have been silly and unfair of her to need to avoid Rose out of possibly hurting my feelings or using a name that I sadly may never have a child to give it to?  Im just glad that were both reasonable about this.  I would have felt very hurt and upset if she had told me she didnt want me using Rose because she used it for her girl.  Infertility is a bitch on its own things like this make it even more painful.My one thing is that now Im trying to avoid names that sound similar to her daughters first name.  For example pretend her girls name is Cindy Rose it isnt really.  I am very fond of Cynthia Rose but wouldnt use it now.  Who knows my cousin may be fine with that but its just too close for me to consider.Ill add that Id slightly prefer if she hadnt used Rose and who knows she may slightly prefer if I didnt use it some day but were both fine with it.  Im a little worried that my aunt grandma to little Cindy Rose will be annoyed and feel like I stole her granddaughters name but my mother sister to the grandma has said she will nip that in the bud if it happens because shes well aware that I loved Rose a good  years before Cindy Rose was even born and have always planned to use it.  Oh and since you asked if wed use a friends name one of my closest friends is named Rose as well.On the other hand if I ever have a boy I plan to use my brothers name as his middle name.  Not because Im overly fond of the name but because I love my brother and want to name my son after him.  I am  sure my brother will approve of this idea.,namenerds,d9hjeo2,1,t5_2xmrc

The gender swipe is really nothing to do with the Irishness of it I think Quentin is Latinate French and Peregrine is Latinate English and more that my family has had a girl with a male name in every generation always before the name became unisex. So weve had Shirley born in the s Sydney born in the s Bentley and Morgan from the s and Evan from the s.

10873341,0,t3_5vcqit,Hahaha Douglas is my fouryearolds name.  It is not even close to common right now but fifty years before the boy was born it was.  This makes it actually my favorite sort of name because its immediately recognizable and yet no one in his age group has it.  Dont let anyone here tell you its a common or usual name in the US.  Check out this quote from the SSAs page on the name For  the number of births with name Douglas is  which represents . percent of total male births in .  If that isnt not popular I dont know what is.  It just seems like a common name because there were so many Dougs for so very longit was in the top  names in the US for sixty years from  to .  For what its worth I also have a Duncan.  In spite of its similarity to Douglas its never risen higher than .  It has still pinged everyone as a real name though if thats the sort of thing that matters to you.Marshall for me is a nice name but unfortunately ruined by Paw Patrol which both of my littles are obsessed with right now.  Its  and kind of climbing up a bit but the height of its popularity was still in the early part of the last centuryit peaked in .  There were just over a thousand little boys named Marshall last year.Rainer isnt on the list at all mind you Im looking back to  here.  It looks to me like a misspelling of Rainier which also is totally unpopular.  Lochlan has risen from nothing to  in  to  in .  That makes it less popular than even Duncan.  Spelling it Lachlan bumps it all the way up to  which actually does represent a pretty big jump since it was  the year before.  If anyones gonna call that trendy its going to take it a long while to reach even Douglas levels of popularity.  Everett is actually the only one of your odd names that isnt odd in the US it was .

I wish I could be more help but I think I would need to be able to read the language. Edit I also found a bit of a clue maybe. Theres this ancient song listed on Wikipedia called Tala al Badru Alayna that has the song lyrics translated with Alayna appearing to line up with mentions of overupon us. This is similar to the usersubmitted listing of the Turkish Arabic derived name Aleyna that mentions it comes from a phrase in the Quran aleina meaning above us. Im guessing this is similar to the Persian meaning but Im basing it off this quote Persian has many borrowed words from Arabic most of which come from Quran. and may be off base. I havent seen anything to suggest it means princess but I can see how that would be related to those other meanings of aboveover as it implies a higher status. ,namenerds,de4sk3e,3,t5_2xmrc

11316988,0,t1_dfeeyq6,I would argue that Henry didnt have a bigger jump and the differences in popularity from year to year are similar between the two names. Henry never had a big jump and neither did Evan. They both slowly changed over time. What is notably different is the way the numbers progressed. In  Henry was  and Evan was . Evan steadily climbed until its current peak at . Henry slowly and slightly lowered in popularity its lowest ranking was  definitely still popular and is now rising back to where it was before so it gives the illusion of trendiness.

11368008,0,t3_622vy2,Ah. I personally really dont like this idea. It may be weird for the half brother to share his name with a sibling especially a sister. Not sure how old he is but I can just hear the complaints of but its MY name and its not even a GIRL name! type of thing or at least some silent harbored resentment about his name being reused for dads new family. Also  and maybe this is totally just me  I get weird vibes from the idea of the last woman I fell in love with married and created a child with loved my name and used it for our son  we should do that exact thing! Aaaand your daughter would be named after two men. Im all about tomboy  gender neutral names like Blake Casey etc. but James is a classic masculine male name. Definitely not gender neutral at all and she may grow to resent it. All that said though maybe you could give her a middle name that is a nod to her dad and brother but with a feminine twist? That would feel much more natural and definitely sweet. Ideas JaneJamieJemmaJayJadeJacquelineJem,namenerds,dfkjihb,5,t5_2xmrc
