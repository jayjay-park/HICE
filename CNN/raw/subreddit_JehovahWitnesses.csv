8699467,0,t1_d6szeon,No dude I am not kidding. How many people have died from being strong armed and manipulated by the no blood policy just to have the Watchtower Society backtrack and say well some blood parts are ok. You decide.And are you sure you want to lead off with other religions do it too when the JWs claim to fame is being the Truth and constantly bashing on other religions as being false? The inherent premise underlying the claim to truth is that JWS are not like any other religion. In fact its members regularly use that line of reasoning  e.g. where else in religion can you see so much love between the brothers and sisters?!?!. So when you say that other religions do the same thing you undermine how special and unique it is supposed to be. Making it sound like any other religion. The fact that it is... well that is beside the point. Im not the one going all apologetics about it.,JehovahWitnesses,d6t2cwq,1,t5_3bh9g

8812583,0,t1_d775arf,Its not wrong. Its written from a limited human perspective. Jehovah used people to write his word. The Bible does not need to explain in scientific detail how things occurred. Consider that in Genesis it seems to suggest that Earth and light was created before the sun and moon. However it could also be interpreted that Jehovah simply made the sun and moon visible in the sky at a later time. Take for it what you want...thats my two cents.,JehovahWitnesses,d775ibk,2,t5_3bh9g

Yes of course.Yet you believe that the vastly more complex engineering schema of DNA poofed?Where is the logic?gt natural selection is a powerful engine for perfecting thingsDo you mean adaptation to an environment?Because you are embedding a logical process engineers build into systems with autonomous intelligence it doesnt make sense and mocks the scientific method.,JehovahWitnesses,d7fbdap,1,t5_3bh9g

9094738,0,t1_d84j8xh,First off you cant just interpret a piece of the bible to conveniently fit into your belief system by adding quotes that arent there. It doesnt say Love is not jealous over the advantages or achievements of others like you quoted. You literally added almost  words to it. The verse is Love is not jealous. Thats it.Jealousy in  Corinthians  is not defined whatsoever. What is defined is love. Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable and it keeps no record of being wronged.  Corinthians  NLTSo you lost that argument.What you can do is compare it with other verses in the bible where the word jealousy is mentioned. So lets look at those one by oneThe Lord your God is a devouring fire he is a jealous God. Deuteronomy  NLTIs love really a devouring fire? If so does it come with a fire extinguisher or do you just burn to a crisp?for the Lord your God who lives among you is a jealous God. His anger will flare up against you and he will wipe you from the face of the earth. Deuteronomy  NLTDoesnt sound loving to kill someone out of anger and jealousy. Im sure you can agree on a personal level that you wouldnt kill your wife for cheating on you right? Then Joshua warned the people You are not able to serve the Lord  for he is a holy and jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins. Joshua  NLTHes not forgiving patient or kind if he literally wont forgive your rebellion and your sins. These verses not only give us a hint as to which type of jealousy is being portrayed in the bible but they also show a stark contrast between the distinct characteristics of what defines love as mentioned in  Corinthians  and who Jehovah truly is.The Lord is a jealous God filled with vengeance and rage. He takes revenge on all who oppose him and continues to rage against his enemies! Nahum  NLTSounds rude to me.You must not bow down to them or worship them for I the Lord your God am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children the entire family is affectedeven children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me. Exodus  NLTIs this loving and forgiving to punish the sons of your cheating wife? I dont think so. Not only is it hateful but its also unkind and boastful to proudly proclaim that.  Corinthians  clearly says love doesnt keep records of wrongdoings yet God here in Exodus  hes keeping a record of wrongdoings for generations!How can Jehovah be God if he is not loving?Love is patient kind forgiving not boastful not proud doesnt keep record of wrongdoing. Jehovah is literally the opposite of that! ,JehovahWitnesses,d851ie2,2,t5_3bh9g
9128507,0,t1_d88bqay,Well shucks  I like to ask and learn and its amazing how I can usually come out of these sort of interactions with new knowledge or perspective.Thanks again for your response. I hope to post some more questions in future. This one has been fun.,JehovahWitnesses,d893r7v,2,t5_3bh9g
9245118,0,t3_56o3vx,This comes from Galatians  where our mother is Jerusalem above.Agreed that they shouldnt be applying it to the WTBS but that conception stems from the visible organization of Ezekiels chariot.Logical deduction based on a false predicate that the WTBS is the visible organization.,JehovahWitnesses,d8nvwpr,1,t5_3bh9g
9462733,0,t1_d9ffxwb,gt Who is the HS actually guiding? Baptists? Episcopalians? Methodists?Opinion time!The Bible is a dragnet.Its written in a way so as to encrypt the message for the one who seeks in spirit and truth e.g. not religiosityConversely is written in a way so as to extract and group the disingenuous those predisposed to quick judgment and assumptions.The question of denomination comes from the flesh and sectarianism.for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.  Corinthians gt If we can trust the Holy Spirit so much as individuals then why are there gt  registered denominations in the US alone?Dont trust in the princes of men the point shouldnt be to identify a person with the Holy Spirit to guide you but seek until you gain the Holy Spirit which will guide youToo many Christians dont start with the truth when they study the Bible which is very simple God is loveSo when they read the scriptures with a view towards God being judgmental for example the Bible will provide them with validation and separate them out.  Case in point the Pharisees.  Yet some like Nicodemus were true seekers.Wheat and the weeds grow together by necessity in order to reveal the genuine.However some things in them are hard to understand and these things the ignorant and unstable are twisting  Peter bIs the question denomination or individual?Jehovah is looking for individuals.  Babylon the Great is looking for denominations.Jehovahs Witnesses uniquely believe that Jesus sacrifice applies to all mankind with a view towards resurrection in his  year rule over the earth.  Implicit in that doctrine is Gods love and a clarification of the intention of the Holy Bible.  So what is the intention of the scriptures uphotowest ?Isnt it to serve as a gathering device for the little flock?,JehovahWitnesses,d9fguzb,1,t5_3bh9g
9468546,0,t1_d9fguzb,Okay heres the deal  Im doing a dissertation and dont really have time to address this suffice to say that this is a lot of verses taken out of context.  They appear to match until they are all read in place.There is also a lot of specific JW theology here like the belief in the little flock.Ill try to remember to come back to this is a few days.Also thisgtJehovahs Witnesses uniquely believe that Jesus sacrifice applies to all mankind... is just wrong.   John  is pretty clear. There is one sacrifice for the remission of sin. Christians almost universally believe this. It is up to the individual whether they receive that gift.,JehovahWitnesses,d9g7ceg,2,t5_3bh9g

10042756,0,t1_dbfqfby,gtSome mammoths were found frozen in Siberia a while ago... That means something catastrophic happened in an instant. Yes the unfortunate animal had apparently fallen down an ice crevasse. Heres an extract from a book by an E. W. Pfizenmayer one of the scientists who actually recovered and studied the mammoth in questionBaron E. von Toll the wellknown geological explore of Arctic Siberia who perished while leading the Russian expedition in  had covered in  most of the sites of previous finds of mammoth and rhinoceros bodies in carrying out his professional investigations. In doing so he had established that the mammoth found by Adams in  buried at the mouth of the Lena in a crevice of a cliff from  to  feet high and sent by him to St. Petersberg had been frozen in a bank of diluvial ice on the slope of the river. This ice bank was not as Adams believed and stated in his description of the site of the find the remains of the old driftice whose crevices had been filled with mud. The fissures in the bank of diluvial ice on the Lena which was far bigger than ours had according to Tolls findings gradually filled with earth from the top downwards and its upper surface covered with alluvial soil to such an extent that a fair number of the tundra plants were able to take root on it.Toll concluded that this particular Siberian ice was in no case recent but was the remains of diluvial inland ice which once covered the whole world and then was gradually overlaid with earth surviving to this day in the Arctic regions in icebanks of varying extent.Our investigations confirmed his opinion. They proved that the animal had been preserved in the same way as Adamss mammoth according to Toll had been. In both cases the bodies had been enbedded in fissures of the diluvial inland ice. Then when the temperature fell the mud disappeared and the ice in which they were fast frozen had kept them complete with their soft parts in a state a preservation through the ages.Before I arrived at the site Herz had partially dug away the hill of earth round the body and so both the forefeet and the hind feet were exposed. These lay under the body so that it rested on them. When one looked at the body one had the impression that it must have suddenly fallen into an unexpected fissure in the ice which it probably came across in its wanderings and which may have been covered with a layer of plantbearing mould. After its fall the unlucky animal must have tried to get out of its hopeless position for the right forefoot was doubled up and the left stretched forward as if it had struggled to rise. But its strength had apparently not been up to it for when we dug it out still farther we found that in its fall it had not only broken several bones but had been almost completely buried by the falls of earth which tumbled in on it so that it had suffocated.Its death must have occurred very quickly after its fall for we found halfchewed food still in its mouth between the back teeth and on its tongue which was in good preservation. The food consisted of leaves and grasses some of the later carrying seeds. We could tell from these that the mammoth must have come to its miserable end in the autumn.He goes on to state that the animal was quite desiccated.

10053761,0,t1_dbhc155,gt I have a difficult time ascribing nefarious intent to this policy. I dont. I consider that the secrecy regarding this issue is now and had always been about protecting the public image of the Watchtower and preventing expensive litigation. The leadership put money and reputation above the safety of children. I think that easily qualified as nefarious.  years ago parents of abused children were told to think of Jehovahs name rather than report. I speak from experience.
