2273841,0,t3_2l9h9v,I get what youre saying but it was incredibly unprofessional of Wysh to start the interview with that question. In fact hed probably even tell you that. Orr is a busy guy and is a hockey legend. And hes got this blogger from Yahoo leading off the interview with a question about the last time he bought himself a drink? We all know Wyshs personality to be that way but theres a time and a place and Wysh struck out on both with that one with Orr. ,mvsw,clsrko0,2,t5_335yk

2426269,0,t1_cmbjz0e,I believe that a lot of GMs feel they could turn around Yakupov and I think theres a good hockey player in him. I mean hell the kid is actually a few months younger than Johnny Gaudreau. I just think that everyone in hockey knows that the Oilers are desperate to make a move and theyre going to want to kinda take them to the woodshed. I do also think Philly could be a trading partner and Sean Couturier is the kind of ndline centre that I think could really help the Oilers but I think the Flyers would drive a hellaciously hard bargain. Also totally not an Oilers fan... I think ... God I dont know when theyll be able to compete. Youd think that if they got one of McDavid or Eichel theyd be a couple years away ... but everyone thought that when they had Gagner Eberle Pajarvi Cogliano and then drafted Hall. Now Cogliano is the owner of the NHL IronMan Streak which began after the Oilers last appeared in the playoffs. ,mvsw,cmblee3,2,t5_335yk

5276800,0,t3_3mirz9,After listening to this weeks podcast went back on reddit... saw this thread and then read Evander Kane article from todays Buffalo NewsGood read  Kane comments on Winnipeg situation.  He downplayed issues about WinnipegI find it interesting when some columnists said E Kane is headed for another small town and have same issues.  While Buffalo and Winnipeg are smallmidsize cities Buffalo has different dynamic with the Buffalo Bills being here and if theres any questions  I would ask Drew Willy to compare.While E. Kane will standout with his social media presence in the hockey realm compared to the Bills it is nothing out of the ordinary.  E. Kane may thrive here with a nd major sports team here similar to the premise that NCAA schools where  good team feeds recruiting for other sports.  There will be opportunities for E. Kane to network with the Bills especially with both teams under Pegula.All things considered E. Kane will measured for his performance on the ice first.,mvsw,cvm66f7,1,t5_335yk

6920304,0,t1_d10pr7b,Hehe ya that quote stuck out to me too... but for the sake of argument I tried to rationalize it in my head.It went something like...While yes if were comparing speed strength shot or any other individual skill or attribute Amanda Kessel obviously doesnt match up with any NHLer or just about any professional male hockey player for that matter. But maybe that quote isnt quite as outlandish as it first seemed.The way I figure it is that we can only really judge players against their peers. For example no one would deny that The Rocket was one of the best hockey players of all time. However the simple truth is that he wouldnt be able to play in the NHL today. Everyone  even your th line scrubs  are stronger than he was are faster than he was are better passers than he was and have better shots that he did. But that doesnt diminish his greatness because his greatness was borne by what he did against his peers.In this way maybe we can say Amanda Kessel is one of the best hockey players of all time. If not Amanda specifically there are certainly women who can be considered among the best hockey players of all time because of how they dominated their peers.,mvsw,d10qnkl,4,t5_335yk
