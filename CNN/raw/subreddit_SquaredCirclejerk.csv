I know its hard to understand for some but the WWE might want people to like more than one wrestler and feel that theres more than one person whos worthy of a tshirt or DVD purchase.  I know its crazy that the WWE doesnt revert back to Cenas heyday or  and just put Bryan in every main event and every major angle. I loved CM Punk as a performer but I had a hard time playing a sad violin for him because he never got his due.  He had a lengthy championship run in the worlds biggest promotion and really at this point in his career main eventing WM is just a formality.  I agree he deserves it but its not like Id look back on his time in WWE and go meh he never main evented WM.  Nobody in this company is over like Hogan Austin or Rock.  And sorry if Cena couldnt really take the company to that level Bryan isnt going to do so as much as I love the guy.  Hes just not a guy you put the weight of the entire company on and say go.  Hes the best worker in the company and worthy of a main event at Wrestlemania but hes going to need to share the main event with some of the other capable people in the WWE.  People bitch about the WWE never making new stars well Bryan already main evented WM hes been a world champ hes selling tshirts like crazy.  Why wouldnt the WWE want to try to create someone else like that?,SquaredCirclejerk,cog490p,6,t5_2slwl

Pic    You could also see it very briefly at the end of her match with Tanner.Wreddit has been super easy to work during the shows run being the last people in the world outside of hardcore Bachelorette fans who think reality TV is real.

6436986,0,t3_43uncm,UJ DO you guys remember last year a when people were coming up with all kinds of conspiracies about how they were being told they cant have antiRoman signs? Oh oh oh or how about the time they absolutely creamed themselves over a post some random guy who claimed to work in WWE said that Roman failed a drug test? Took the mods until morning to bring it down because it was posted late enough for them to probably be sleeping yet the post could still gain traction.Fun times. But seriously I forgot how intolerable that place can be. ,SquaredCirclejerk,czl4fcd,28,t5_2slwl
6473545,0,t1_czowjls,Im guilty of fandom I did fan art mashups of Punk sold them made some money. I even got into talks with one of those tshirt sites Pro Wrestling Tees I think it was and was expecting to hear from them probably about doing some Punk related stuff. Instead I got a cease and desist from them. The problem is theyre selling stuff thats the same genre as I did fan art mash ups  Punk as Wolverine or Batman while theyve got him as Thor or they have a Black Flag faux logo shit like that. Why am I bringing this up? Seems relevant because the point is Punk doesnt treat people fairly. Hes supposed to be this surly but kind nerd and he acts like a little privileged bitch. Shameful really. ,SquaredCirclejerk,czows1t,1,t5_2slwl
