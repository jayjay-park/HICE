You then panicked and decided to detach the DB which means youre most likely on a version pre . Any of that correct?If you have a halfways recent backup create and empty shell of the DB being recovered same name etc. take it offline and then delete all the files These have to be identically named to the actual DB youre trying to recover and paste in your log file. Ensure you have instant file initialisation enabled and brig the DB online. Ignore the errors and do a tail of the log backup. Restore your primary from backup and restore your log sequence.If you have no backups youre going to have to hack attach the DB. Basically create a new DB with files named identically to the existing DB. Take it offline and delete the new files. Paste in the old files and try to bring it online. It may not work but give it a shot.The more information you can provide the more help people can be.

It has instead set the target to GB well below the max setting.

The break even point for licensing the whole host will vary based on the cores in your physical host and the number of SQL servers you have and what features they need. For instance in a project I was working on it was cheaper to license just the  cores for the one server running PowerPivot and use standard everywhere else. It wasnt what I wanted to do but money talks! Budget is always a complementary consideration when deciding your licensing.

From a technology viewpoint I do see a strong move to the cloud quite beneficial for customers in all its existences SAAS IAAS PAAS. Microsoft has quite a decent cloud offering with Azure and its Database services but it faces fierce competition from Amazon a.o. DBA activities as in proactively maintaining databases and db servers will require less work in the future.  I would think you will have to either move up functionalitywise ETL Data modeling BI Architecture what have you or broaden your expertise with other different database stacks including cloud Amazon Redshift PostgreSQL Greenplum DocumentDBMongoDBNeoj.     Just the other day we were having a discussion on MPP database servers providing scalability like NoSQL DBs without the disadvantages.

Ive used TableVars with success when theyre only storing a handful of observations anything that is heavier has always been less efficient than running in a temp table or if thats not an option populating a staging table w stored proc.  Tablevars are also stored and parsed in memory which contributes to their clunkiness.I tell my Junior devs to use them sparingly and wisely.

5585768,0,t3_3rivzo,Some questions What OS version is it on now? Is it Standard or Enterprise? What software do you use for monitoring? Why are you moving it to new hardware? Is there a problem? Are you an accidental DBA? Do you have a DBA? You know that  its licensed completely differently per couple of cores right?  So licensing costs will be different between your old server and your new server. SQL  will have better high availability options in Standard edition if you have Software Assurance though the application would have to support it. Otherwise its equivalent to  Enterprise with Software Assurance for a simple setup. HA is always a good business sell.SQL  is really shaping up amazingly. Its worth waiting for though I can think you can upgrade for free if you had Software Assurance.If your major app is an off the shelf product then you probably will not be able to replace the portions that give you the biggest bang for back in SQL  performance and storage column store inmemory OLTP  etc. You need developers for that or vendor support and they will likely not do that for years yet.If youre using SQL as a dumb black box to store data with no HA no developers no DBAs then theres no incentive to upgrade IMHO.,SQLServer,cwpgszo,1,t5_2qlzx
5698598,0,t3_3t62cv,Access is a common first start for folks myself included. Whats funny is that once you do start writing code in SQL Server Management Studio you will quickly realize how much easier it is. Doesnt seem like it would be from the outside but The syntax is so much cleaner than Accesss subset of TSQL. There are no requirements that all left joins be contained in parentheses and the ambiguous outer joins error disappears. Because you are not doing gymnastics to overcome database limitations at least not for the same ones you no longer have to build queries up that will perform as subqueries in other queries. Suddenly your objects are all stored with their context. Version control becomes possible because all your work is saved as text. I have a testing environment and a production environment automatic build scripts  and a nice directory structure separating my build queries from user and admin queries.. managing complex projects is a lot easier.

9193241,0,t1_d8h8ult,gtOr is it that the more views you use the more the odds you have a view including the some SQL written by That Guy. You know the one who selects from tables in his scalar functions or does clever things with rownumber.Exactly.Nested view per se isnt the issue but a very deep nest of view is very likely to be result of a poorly designed query.Personally the ones I have in my system and Im not proud of are result of analises that was made in the long of the time like one day we did a query months later we needed other aspects that required part of that view so we joined that then we needed a procedure that is based in that last view and it became a snowball gtgt ,SQLServer,d8hb7i3,1,t5_2qlzx

For those I do the same exact steps above and name it DC and execute a few scripts to setup the domain.Here they all are   Create a machine as above Execute the following scripts on the new DC machine RenameComputer.ps SetStaticIP.ps  InstallDomainTools.ps creates the domainNow create a new directory  actually Node and Node and run these on each RenameComputer.ps SetStaticIP.ps  JoinDomain.psYou now have  nodes on a domain in which you can start to install a SQL Cluster quickly and easily.If you want to emulate a SAN or something of that sorts there are several articles about how to do that in a VM   for instanceFor single machines I used the AddDrives.ps file to add all the drive names and formats I need per standards.Cheap Plug  I use all of this setup as part of my testing while maintainingimproving SQLSPADE and automated install script for SQL Server all versions.  ,SQLServer,d9r14wg,3,t5_2qlzx

Your databases are spread out on multiple instances...unless someone just installed a bunch of instances with no databases for some reason.You could consolidate to a single instance or multiple instances recreating the instances or individual vms for each instances provided you can license them all.  Only recreating the instances will get you away from changing application connections strings.,SQLServer,dats3c3,2,t5_2qlzx

10284750,0,t3_5n4nep,One of the biggest tricks I use are the Keyboard Query Shortcuts.Most people know sphelp  Alt  F... but you can then add your own.Tools gt Options gt Environment gt Keyboard gt Query ShortcutsI mainly useCtrl  F    sphelptextCtrl      SELECT TOP   FROM I use that one the most. Just hightly a table press Ctrl   and quickly look at the columns on a table and get a sense of the data thats in it....The last one only works if you have a Lookup  Constants schema. We put our look up tables in a schema named Constants since the values of the Key column are always constant. So i have Ctrl   as    SELECT TOP   FROM Constants.For example lets say i have the table Constants.CustomerType with the column CustomerTypeKey. In a query that has SELECT CustomerTypeKey i can highlight CustomerType and press Ctrl   to quickly see the values. It also works great in procedures. Instead of having a WHERE clause with    WHERE t.CustomerTypeKey  I set up variables like     CustomerType     DECLARE CustomerTypeValueA TINYINT                    CustomerTypeValueB TINYINT      WHERE t.CustomerTypeKey  CustomerTypeValueAI usually only declare the ones that Im using. But if i need to look up the rest i just quickly Highlight the table nameCtrl  LMB in the comment and hit Ctrl  .,SQLServer,dc9u026,2,t5_2qlzx

Mine ran fine with spupdatestats in R but after moving to  I found that it wasnt enough.  You could even switch between mode  and  and watch the query plan change.

It does the job pretty well and we can get more licenses.As for source control we use RedGate source control because it was available before DevArt pushed their own solution. I will reevaluate this when our maintenance ends with RedGate. DevArt tools are really good cost effective and they have a very good support they fix errors on the spot RedGate tend to drag fixing errors forever try out demos  I highly recommend it.,SQLServer,dduf04f,1,t5_2qlzx

11348665,0,t3_61yool,gt its used every day by the senior most people in the companyTo me this seems like a suspicious statement. It might be worth some effort to track down exactly who uses the report and what they use it for. Maybe start simple with some basic logging of whos viewed the report really depends on how the report is distributed.You could also consider a bit of a bad coder no doughnut approach. For certain selected individuals and leave certain selected values blank. See who complains have a let me just fix that button ready to send out the full correct report. Though be careful you dont want to cause too many problems all at once.Shoe leather is also a good approach. Just go ask someone who gets the report what they do with it. Just a quick conversation no need for a meeting or agenda... just pop by and say Hi Im Bob from IT. I was wonder how you use report XYZ?.You might be surprised by what you find out eg. a colleague of mine found one massive report that took an hour to produce and two reams of paper to print was being carefully filed by a clerk just in case the auditors needed it at some point in the future.gt each of which with its own esoteric formula that nobody agrees onThats a big problem.gt The stored procedures and formulas are written terribly perform terribly and are not documentedEek. More of the same problem.Step  document what the numbers mean and how theyre calculated.  numbers divided by  is  numbers each. Document  number a week and about  months everyone will be in a much better position to make decisions.Edit Why is this a big deal? Is the  hours of run time interfering with something?

11377608,0,t1_dflarkr,Yes thats certainly and understandably by design.And there are certainly ways around it. Yours sounds a bit more elegant but I would probably look to write BIMLBimlScript to generate the packages first personally then build from that as required.I wasnt really referencing a single data source with changing metadata. As you say that situation would require some justification. Just meant a requirement to stage a few hundred tables where building the packages by hand would be rather time consuming.
