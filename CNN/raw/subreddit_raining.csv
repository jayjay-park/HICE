7269171,0,t3_4ex5g8,Everytime I see raindrops in a glassgtI dont know look its terrible how its raining. Its raining all the time dense and gray outside here drops dull and hard come against the balcony with a splat! squashing themselves like slaps piling one onto another how tedious.  Now a droplet appears just at the top of the window frame  stays there quivering against the sky shattered into a thousand subdued glints about to fall down but wont fall still wont fall.  It holds on tight all nails doesnt want to fall and its clear it grips with its teeth while its belly grows bigger and bigger its now a majestic drop hanging there and then plonk there it goes splat undone nothing only a clammy something on the marble.   But there are those that kill themselves and surrender right away sprouting in the frame whence they jump off outright I can even make out the dives vibration their little legs falling off and the inebriating scream in the fleetingness of the fall and their annihilation. Sad gloomy despondent drops plump and gullible drops. Goodbye drops. Goodbye.gtJulio CortzarIts quite amazing.,raining,d24gdwp,2,t5_2y0zz

8967864,0,t1_d7pfp1z,Well London Heathrow and Gatwick are our busiest airports and the ones youll like arrive at from the U.S however others are available. If you can fly to Birmingham there is lots to do there and interesting things to see. The University of Birmingham the German Market if you come at Christmas and the town hall amongst other great little spots of history. London has all the famous museums and galleries youll want to see and the big skyline akin to NYC of course not quite as grand. The southwest of the U.K is one of the most beautiful places to visit. Dorset in particular is the place to go if youre looking for gorgeous rolling hills idyllic seaside towns and historical landmarks. If you ever do come or need more info drop me a message!,raining,d7psvev,2,t5_2y0zz
