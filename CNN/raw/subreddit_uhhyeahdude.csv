Sharing a malted is how you knew you were going steady back then. Now according to Jah you know youre going steady when a girl takes a massive load to the face. ,uhhyeahdude,cq4fe68,8,t5_2s5iq

8968234,0,t3_532i32,A lot of really popular podcasts tend to be part of podcasting collectives Ferral Audio Ear Wolf NPR etc. and they all tend to advertise each other which results in a lot of discussion about them especially in the media. UYD as far as I know dont get shoutouts or ads on other podcasts and if they do it probably isnt orchestrated or planned and the opposite is true as well since they dont advertise anything at all let alone other podcasts. Theyve built up enough of an underground following that they dont need to form partnerships which means no one is advertising for them which also means not much media attention. ,uhhyeahdude,d7pugwx,9,t5_2s5iq
