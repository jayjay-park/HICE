20711,0,t1_cegjh67,Depends on what you are looking to get out of your Navy career. As an IS youre going to be doing a lot of intelligence briefs. Theres a reason we jokingly call them power point specialists. I love my job as a CTR. I fly on the EPE which I very much prefer to sitting on a watch floor. Sure the days can be long but Id much rather be actively taking part in the intelligence effort than just briefing about it. Plus Ive done my fair share of briefings as a CTR anyway. As a CTR your choice of orders is going to be VERY diverse. Surface subsurface Air Shore you name it and theres a CTR job there for it rank and CSchools being a huge factor obviously. If youre in the Navy for the long haul CTR is a great choice for its speedy advancement.Edit Not talking bad about IS sorry if it looks like that. Just my knowledge of them is limited to what Ive dealt with while deployed from a Direct Support shop.,navy,cegshkd,1,t5_2rg06

82367,0,t3_1v0iwh,Well I mean its Mississippi. So theres that. Its certainly not California.I did however find the base to be quite charming. Its older smaller and quiet. Really nothing special there. They have all the types of businesses youd expect or need in the area. Offbase housing is very reasonably priced and youll be looking at less than  to rent a standard  bedroom ranch house less for an apartment. The school system is actually surprisingly good. You know for Mississippi. I dont know what you enjoy doing but youre a  minute drive from the city of Biloxi and Keesler AFB a major Air Force installation and never more than a couple of miles from a large body of water. Were not talking about Pensacola beaches here but theyre nice enough. There are also some casinos and adultish things to do in the city of Biloxi. Edit Also the jokes are true. Anywhere there is an Air Force base there are at least three golf courses. This is no exception.In short Gulfport is nothing special but if I was to be stationed in Mississippi thats where Id want to be. ,navy,cent14j,6,t5_2rg06

1119153,0,t3_26rgtv,This is a really good question.. When I first started deploying I premade care packages and prepaid shipping and had them ready to be dropped off at regular intervals by my mom. Then later Amazon came out with this genius thing that lets you order certain items to be shipped regularly. This meant I was never out of my favorite granola bars and protein shakes and shampooconditionerrazors new tshirts and socks. Explain in GREAT detail to whoever is mailing you stuff that soap products and food products never go in the same box. . Foodstuffs....Sweet Poseidon chow sucks balls. Also granola bars are excellent because that means you can still get a decent nap at lunch or some gym time in instead of fighting the chow line. Pretty much what ubromance said regarding the foodstuffs locker. Ramen pop tarts those tuna salad and cracker packs nuts granola fruit roll ups candy popcorn soups anything non perishable is the way to go. . I know youre not supposed to put personal detergent in ships laundry but the Purex in washerdryer sheets tucked into your knit bag or the Tide Nugget thingies are excellent. I love having coveralls that smell nice. I know Im an HT but I still dont like to smell like CHT okay? Also one particularly hot and smelly deployment I cut a normal dryer sheet into strips and put one in each pocket and one under my collar. I smelled awesome until I had to unclog stuff. I hate that ships laundry smell. Also nice to tuck a few dryer sheets under your sheets when you make your rack. BOOM. Clean and Fresh scent all night long. . Also like uDocMichaels said a community hard drive is a must. If you have a coed shop or anyone who might get offended for that matter get two. Put the porn on a separate one. The guys in my shop were considerate enough to do that for me the only girl and I appreciate it. I dont want to know someone in my shop has a Johnny Waffle fetish. Seriously keep that in berthing.. I always make deployment videos. Have everyone contribute video clips or pictures of different ports and the work day....it becomes a nice community project and when we look back at a miserable day with cool music and nice video editing like climbing into the CHT tank its more of a Yeah! We did that! and gives my junior guys a sense of pride and accomplishment. And you can mail a DVD home halfway and all the spouses and parents will think you are pretty much the best ever. Its your deployment its YOUR story. I also make a personal deployment cruise book using Shutterfly If the shop wants to make it a group project though it could be a nice moral booster. It helped me look at deployment as more of a fun thing instead of a I wish I was home now thing....I was trying to create memories to put in a video or book and so I did exactly thatcreated cool memories. For example on deployment EVERY SUNDAY instead of a holiday routine like every other ship in the fleet we had to do a Fresh Water Washdown. So I made a small video about it. It looks like were having fun doesnt it? Yeahour perspective changed when it became a chapter in the video of this is what deployment is like.  Even if you dont go the mediaediting route finding something you can do as a shop is a huge morale booster.. I dont know your rateand consequently where you workbut water balloons and water guns are always fun. Especially if its a gulf deployment.. This goes handinhand with number  We chipped in and bought Rock Band. Outdated now I know but that thing has gotten us through many many deployments. Before going out and buying shop gaming systems check with your MWR onboard because they might have a lot of things you dont know aboutmovies xboxps games...and also wiffleball or badminton basketballs and a hoop you can mount in the helo hanger my CG even had several punching bags. One of the EMs also hooked us up with some cabling that went into Tool Issue and into the EM shop and we were able to play Call of Duty against other shops. More fun and kept them out of our space. Anything you can do as a shop is great. . Inquire about your sailor phone and plan accordingly. We had one on the CG that didnt require a phone card. The LHD however did. Or get in good with the ITs. . Back up headphones. I mustve lost washed had stolen or broke one set a month. Also an extra iPod charger.. At least once a month see if you can get some assistance from your neighborhood CSes. This doesnt work so well since youre probably not an HT but CS and I HT have an understanding every Friday without fail he will hook my shop up with pizza and wings for our shop movie night....and we will immediately drop everything to unclog something in his galley. If its been a particularly atrocious week hell throw in some cookies cake or icecream. And I wont yell at him too much when his guys pour uncooked rice down the drain. If that means you need to store CSs favorite carbonated beverage that they dont carry in the ships vending machines then you guys better buy a couple cases of Cream Soda. Or offer to paint a pway for them. But if you can get a shop movie night once a month for all of deployment it might be worth it. especially if youve preordered that new movie on Amazon or had someone at home mail you a hard drive with some pirated movies that are still in theatresIm sorry that was so long....Im sure Ill come up with more later though.Happy sailing. ,navy,chviar6,4,t5_2rg06

1187289,0,t1_ci2m89o,For most handlers it seemed like advancement was the breaking point.  I knewknow very few MAs working a dog.  The ones I did know put it on while in K and dropped leash after that rotation.  Unless things have changed it was very difficultnext to impossible to put on Chief without a warfare pin.  I came in just after the surge to grow the rate and advancement was slowing down.  Most MAs never had the opportunity to get ESWS or AWS and with things drawing down overseas getting IAd to the marines to get FMF isnt really happening.  So it came down to giving up the dog and going to ship or riverine or face high year tenure in the future.  MWD wasis very much the redheaded step child of security.  Unless there was somebody in the chain that had worked a dog they didnt really understand what was going on in the kennel and people easily got passed over for EPs.  Also given that there are relatively few kennels in the fleet there isnt a huge demand for kennel masters.The work isisnt mundane.  Yes it is a lot of the same thing.  Feed the dogs.  Spray the kennel.  Pull training aides.  Mishaps arent frequent but I think everybody I know has been bit at some point.  There is one big important inspection that happens but as long as the dog preforms and paperwork is in order its not terrible.  Random kennel inspections from the Army veterinarians caused more problems than anything.  Mostly because the kennels were outdated.,navy,ci36t2e,1,t5_2rg06

Atos do the basics of troubleshooting aircraft parts. Atis do more in depth troubleshooting. Atos work on the flight line and hanger bays doing real hard work same with aes. Atis have it made. We work in air conditioned work shops which is great.  Youll know which one you get once your orders get cut in boot camp. Boot camp is going to suck a lot but if you just do what youre supposed to do then youll be fine. I suggest taking up a leadership position while in bootcamp. Pensacola is going to seem awesome at first because you wont be in bootcamp anymore but after a month or two youll be real sick of all the bullshit rules and musters to deal with.

Smoke was used extensively in WWI WWII and many modern vessels including USN warships have the ability to produce smoke.Here is a picture of USN AEGIS destroyers generating smoke for missile defense from the Navy.mil website where it talks about producing smoke and how awesomely effective it is for modern warships as a defensive technique Most small fast attack boats have smoke lauchers because smoke is a great way to make yourself a harder target for gunners and since longbow and griffin and every similar weapons system use laser guidance for target accusation its very effective at making it harder to acquire targets. Pintle mounted MGs would have a problem with aiming while moving fast and evading point defense fire but a lot of more modern gun systems are stabilized by a computer and have very little problems shooting very accurately from a small fast moving boat. Up close any gunner thats not shitty is going to have no problem moving fast or not walking an MG onto a pintle mount or a radar dome. And by up close I mean  yards.Dont talk about shit with authority if you dont know what you are talking about. ,navy,cp7l9zu,1,t5_2rg06

3954927,0,t3_35rbha,First off congratulations you lucky bastard.Ive not actually worked with the Marines there much but been there several times and the base is large and quite nice actually.  Theres a great pool and gym housing is good quality for a Navy base and theres plenty to do on base its a big place.  Kailua is right there and Kalama park is gorgeous  but lets be honest most of the beaches on Oahu are.  You can kayak to them easily or if youre a good swimmer just swim to Moku Nui islands the Mokes just at the bend south of Kaneohe its a fun picnic and you can swim around them and jump off rocks and all that I never tire of that little excursion for some reason.  Good workout too if you swim it did it in moderate waves once and it was a challenge  watch the riptide  but its less than a mile though so youre right there anyway and its usually pretty calm.Its a very quick minute jump on the H acrossunder the mountains to Pearl and north Honolulu and if you head the slightlysouthern route on Pali Hwy Highway  you get to the Pali Lookout which is simply breathtaking and a place I have just stopped at to take in the view and decompress many times when driving over.  Downtown Honolulu and Diamondhead and all that are that route so you can hit clubs or whatever.  There are plenty of watering holes right where the  comes into Kailua though thats way closer literally  minutes to the gate.  Youre away from the haphazardness of Pearl and congestion of Honolulu yet not too far away and morning views at dawn are going to be amazing daily.  Id live there in an instant if ... wait why dont I live there again?  Hmmm.With all that the Kaneohe side offers does it really matter that youll be working with rifleman they taught to fly?  Not to me.  ,navy,cr73g3f,5,t5_2rg06

4619077,0,t1_ctcnown,I cant disagree with any individual point.  Youre absolutely right.  Its no longer about what a chief brings to the mess and the command its just about MAKING chief.  And that is the heart of the problem as you pointed out.  I think its a tragedy that the CPO has become a laughing stock instead of the SME he is supposed to be.  Thats not all the Chiefs fault however.  Reduced manning has cut back on CPO billets such as the LSD class of ship that lost its GMC billet  the FCC is responsible for those workcenters now.  How can you expect a new chief to succeed and be the SME when he likely knows very little  about the GM rate? With less Chiefs onboard the pool of knowledge is lessened.  Much more emphasis is placed on junior personnel to step up because there isnt another option.Now none of these issues are an excuse for an E to sit on hisher ass and just not give a damn about anything other than their own advancement.

And that the USN and USMC are the expeditionary forces that fight from the Sea. Yes? I also understand that the top Flag Officers in Washington make decisions all the time that make little to no sense and the Marine Corps usually A gets thrown into retarded situations that dont fit its mission or B throws itself onto missions that it has no business being a part of in order to not lose funding or get axed by stupid Senators. A lot of Marines died fighting a land battle they shouldnt have been a part of. Sangin for instance saw the Marine come in and pacify a hostile city. Then they were told to hold the city and occupy it. Even if I was going with the flawed concept of the USMC fighting in the middle of a desert their nature is to be the first in and Fuck shit up. And then a week later to move on and Fuck some other spot up. The Army is supposed to come in afterwards and occupy guard and stomp all remaining resistance. Its why they have so much money technology and armor plated shit. So why in Sangin as well as a multitude of other places were the Marines told it was now their job to just stay there. Yes they were following orders but duty of that nature is not what they are trained for its not what they do best. The Army has so many fucking people and so much money that it couldnt say hey guys we got this yknow cause its our job. Where was that?Anyway my original point was that the Marine Corps does best when Politicians and other focus groups quit trying to throw political correctness sticks in its spokes. It was also shameful of them to insinuate that the Marines didnt send the most qualified women to be a part of this experiment. Colonel Germano was also correct in stating that Women also dont receive the same level of training.If you see me on the street Ill tell you which Operation I was a part of.

The chiefs in the past used to be the end allbe all for knowledge in a particular field and the last line if something broke or failed. Thats no longer the case for the navy and if an E now has troubles their chief isnt going to know because he either worked on a legacy systemdoesnt have that NEC. So that E is then left to email some civilian  miles away for help and guidance.  So what role does that chief have now?Theyre now trying to define their role as some kind of moral figure holding the troops to a standard that lets face it doesnt make sense in a lot of situations looking at you jacket has to be zipped up all the way while on watch in combat at am just to stay relevant in some way.  I wouldnt even have a huge deal with this if they could actually police their own but because they protect themselves and their own its constantly a chief yelling at a sailor while covering up for his friend doing the same thing the night before or worse.The worst part is that theyre so pretensions about being a chief. Just due to the nature of my job and being married to my wife i end up rubbing shoulders with everyone from literal admirals down to E and below and i can tell you with  certainty that the mess is the absolute worst group to have to deal with. A full bird captain will shake your hand and introduce themselves by their first name while a chief will introduce themselves by title and last name while refusing to shake your hand. They seem to have a unsaid motto that its better to be rude than accidentally appear human to someone who could be lower than them in rank. After they find out that I am not junior enlisted then theyre suddenly fine with me.What the navy needs to do is just get rid of their special room take away their gold belts and make them just regular enlisted again. Shift the title of chief over to warrants and then just make E though E just like every other enlisted person. It would solve lot of their problems because it would eliminate the stigma of chief and have the ability to fire the bad and be able to reprimand the disobedient. ,navy,czwpuo6,21,t5_2rg06

A month later I was told those orders were cancelled and I had to attend the advanced version of the C school instead and if I refused the orders Id get a hotfill I really didnt want instead of keeping my original orders. So I said okay sucked it up and went to the second  month C school. They didnt have my sign another extension though  probably slipped through the cracks.Four months into that program got my orders for my follow on to the exact same hotfill different billet but same station. Asked my chief if I could swap orders with someone else who wanted to and was told that it wasnt permitted. So I told him Im going to drop the school then. Id go to those orders I didnt want but wouldnt sign the extension since I didnt want to stay in the Navy any longer than I had to. Chief got all flustered and walked away. Three days later after Im sure he informed someone higher than him who didnt want all the Navys money wasted that it had invested in the training the policy was magically changed and we were allowed to swap.

9081196,0,t3_54nn09,I guess technically both my commands were sea duty though I never was on a ship. I did my first tour on FAA birds. Some of the oldest still active in the fleet. The Hornet was extremely easy to learn. The tech pubs broke it down kindergarten style and they were set up in a logical manner. When they told you have to remove a part the very next section told you how to reinstall it. I had pretty cake detachments. Key West every other month or so for two to three weeks. Did Guam for a month.  Nellis detachments where we were put up in hotels on the Vegas Strip. Fallon dets sucked a bit as did Miramar. The hours kinda sucked there were times where we went a month or more without a day off getting ready for some inspection or detachment. My second command was Cs out of Mugu. Now the C was a pain in the ass to work on. The tech pubs were written by engineers on meth. When you finally found the section to remove something it it was about two lines consisting of Remove item then the reinstallation procedure was sometimes in a completely different section. The trouble shooting trees were laughable. The amount of man hours to do simple tasks like engine changes were insanely high. All that being said the Herc was the greatest platform I was on. It required more than basic mechanicing to work on. There were little tricks and tips you had to figure out. It took some thinking to figure out a problem. There werent as many detachments there. We did Bahrain and Sigonella for  months. Rotating crews twice. I spent almost  months in each place in four years. We had a lot of off time. We worked  days a week. Depending on the mission we could be at work for  hours or  minutes. If there were no planes at home we rarely States at work. It was here I worked my longest shift  straight hours fighting with an engine and  prop swap. Then a  hour nap then back at work to be there so the plane could leave on a mission. Granted we got  days off afterwards in Scicily. It was with them I got to go north of the Arctic Circle and eat whale sushi marinated in Brandy. Also had one of the best steaks Ive ever eaten in Portugal and got to go to Stonehenge. ,navy,d83euo1,1,t5_2rg06

A meal has to be composed of X number of thingsa salad with so many toppings to choose from a soup a desert a drink one entree one side two vegetables. I think anyway. If udaimii is around he can chime in. But anyway the CSes have to put so many different types of options out pork and fish and beef and poultry within a set parameter meeting the  day cycle some of those constraints are that they wont ever put two pork entrees out for example. Anyway so if you are allotted ONE entree then thats what you get. The officer was wrong for asking and the CSesFSAs were wrong for complying. If it bothers you this much fill out a meal evalthose get read by the CO. Also go to your commands Menu Review Boardthe supply department likes feedback if it is offered kindly and constructively. Also Life Pro Tipbe consistantly NICE to the people who serve you food. Bring an FSA a coke or some chips or something next time you swing by the vending machine. Then a few days later so it doesnt look like youre bribing someone try asking for a double portion and see what comes of it. ...I spent all last night digging tamale wrappers out of the garbage disposal because some dipshit FSA shoved them down the drain and clogged everything up.

I cant say I have been in the exact shoes you have almost reverse despite my hard work. I was assigned to a new ship several years ago. My first Cutter in the guard. Im an IT and I landed in a engineering role onboard this cutter. For those that dont know as a Coastie onboard a cutter we find ourselves doing much more than rated specialty. I was checking engines oil temps pressure doing prop test viscosity test etc etc etc. All of which I had never done before. I reported along side a bunch of MKs who knew what was what and I knew jack shit. I was the last to get qualified and the Master Chief constantly reminded me and held me back at the same time. It was an uphill battle for me that didnt get resolved till I yelled at the Master Chief in the Chiefs mess. I received some negative paper work but it also opened the other Chiefs eyes to what was happening and things changed after that. Long story short that whole training period I was depressed. My Wife noticed my kids noticed. So I sought help and it paid off in dividends. I always gave  to that cutter and in the end I left loving that ship even made SoQ and left with a CG Achievement Medal Medals are harder to come by in the Coast Guard.

10042942,0,t3_5jgjkt,Adm. Richardson visited my station the other week and talked about the ratings. He mentioned that it surprised him and much of the leadership over the attachment to the rating titles. The thought was there was more sentiment  for being part of where you were what community you were part of what ship submarine base eyc. you were assigned to. We gather in fire teams battalions groups stations and commands. In each we are a conglomerate of rates and specialties. Correct me if Im wrong but it is not usually seen that a single rating is assigned to an entire command. The Admiral realized after the change that there is this unspoken and unofficial club that is recognized for each of the rates. While they might not always fight together  they are respected for their expertise and relate with each other in that field.Im glad Big Navy has recognized the rates because Im sure there is a lot of hard work and pride that goes into each rating. To ignore what one has rightfully earned is disrespectful. However I do agree there needs to be a better way to translate the ratings to civilian occupations or make it easier for one to lattransfercrosstrain.

That first night one of the female RDCs got a cheap bottle of brown hair dye and basically held my head under the sink to dye it.Not having conditioner for two months plus that did a number on it so by battle stations I had a frizzy poof of this weird gunmetalforest green color. My RDC came in early the night before graduation woke me up and handed me another bottle stuck around while I dyed it.We were waiting for it to set and she asks me why I did it.Honestly petty officer?Yeah honestly.Because its going to be at least six years before I can blatantly disregard the rules again.She laughed so hard she woke people up.My service record still has an input photo of me with aquamarine hair. Its this buried reminder that I probably shouldnt actually be here what were they thinking?Which makes me smile.Totally worth it.,navy,df31zpp,2,t5_2rg06

Should have seen their facesThe scampered to the door just two happy sapsWhen my friend whispered to me That place is full of trapsHours go by and who do we see?Two smiley as fuck relaxed FTsThey bounded up towards us filled with joyAnd gushed about how these ladies just played with their toysThis right then was where the whole world was flippedWhen good old Brendan had to open his lipsYou see my friends there was a trickEach one of those ladies is sporting a dickWhite had washed across these facesDisbelief and denial were their only safe spacesTheir lives had changed with nothing to sayand all Brendan did was call them gayReturning to the sub about  to They begged us all not to talk about the chicksWe looked at the kids and just couldnt refrainAnd spread the legend of the FTs in BahrainMoral of the story Happy socks are always congruent with whatever sexual orientation you choose.

If not I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and will back them up in every way.They allowed for the women in their group to wear headscarves against their will.
