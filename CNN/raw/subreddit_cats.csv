11369,0,t3_1u7bwn,Bless your heart! Often the animals that no one wants or lose faith on turn out to be the absolute best. They turn out to be the most lovable because they really rely on their humans. My little legged dude and I had one of those moments when I laid eyes on him. I knew no one was gonna want his scrawny notcute butt especially just getting out of surgery and needing lots of work afterwards. But we took him and everyone was wrong. He eats more than I do and now has super poofy soft fur. He works well without his leg and never ever stops purring. He greets me every single night is always in my lap and never leaves my side. My point is folks when you see those pets that you think are unadoptable definitely adopt them! You just saved a life and they will repay that every single day. Glad to hear your little boy is doing well OP. lt,cats,cefq964,3,t5_2qhta

21147,0,t1_cegu1hu,We only had her for a month and although she got along great with our male cat she didnt get along well with my kids. In fact they were making her skittish and very much a recluse so we found her a home with older children who werent so hands on my kids are very young. I was very sad to see her go because she was so great when the kids were asleep but it really would have been selfish of me and unfair to her for us to keep her. We well no get any more pets until the kids are old enough to control themselves and respect their boundaries. Weve been lucky with Baggins he is great with them tolerates their love and loves then too. ,cats,cegu9xm,5,t5_2qhta

144086,0,t1_ceutpxe,Sure I could take my evening after an eleven hour shift and do the research to link someone to the proper studies.  I could write up case studies and have them submitted for review by my Vet Tech peers.  At the end of the day though I just want to look at the funny pictures on Reddit and zone the fuck out because I was pissed on four times scratched by a pissed off cat had my hand in the anus of several animals one of which expressed their anal glands all over me and wrestled a lb Rotty that Im pretty sure damaged my back.  They did their own research they found their own answer.  They might be swayed by the absolutely perfect article if I were to take the time to find it and hand it to them.  I dont want to change their mind though I simply want them to be more open to the possibility that there might be some therapeutic benefits and to continue their own research.  I cant hand someone their opinion they need to come to it on their own.  I offered anecdotal evidence to their contrary opinion they can choose to follow it up on their own time or not.  If youve closed yourself off to possibilities then theres nothing I can say or do to prove otherwise.  An example?  I can list the benefits of spaying and neutering all day to a client but if they arent open to the possibility that they are wrong then its not going to do any good.  You pick your battles and tonight on Reddit is not going to be one of them. ,cats,ceuuc2z,1,t5_2qhta

No need to confine her to one room either thats only for when there are other cats around and they need to sniff each other out before meeting face to face. So you can safely let her have the run of the place. From what youre saying shes already started exploring especially at night when everythings quiet.

510506,0,t1_cfy6508,Eye boogers dont necessarily mean the animal is unhealthy. Smooshfaced aka brachycephalic cats tend to produce more tears than others which is why the vast majority of them have gross stains on their faces. It just has to do with the shape of the skull and sinuses. This goes for dogs too. This particular cat just needs to either groom himself or have someone wipe his eyes.

720586,0,t1_cgm6ar3,Please get involved with a rescue group. You would be shocked to find out how many times they get what they call unadoptables. These are cats that are friendly but dont seem able to figure out how to live in a house. We had a tom last year who was a sweet heart and I brought him in and got him fixed and tested and tried to teach him about litter boxes but he just crapped on the bed and sprayed  my husbands monitor lol.He would have been a perfect barn cat.Instead of bringing in a bunch of new cats and making a poor female have litter after litter which actually increases their chance of breast cancer save the life of a cat that is already here and who will be killed because he cant be placed inside a home.I am not berating you. I am just offering an alternative to breeding barn cats.,cats,cgm6mov,15,t5_2qhta
721340,0,t3_22ezfx,I concur on offering the  for the owner to take the animal to a vet to get it checked out. Ask for some proof that they took the animal to the vet or otherwise they could just say he got a clean bill of health. Being lethargicinactive and runny eyes for such a young cat worries me. Also since the cat has no papers you cant be sure its a Bengal. For all you know its a pretty DSH cat. In case if it is a pure bred or half bengal youll also have to prepare for the worst since you have no idea what the parents health was like. Cats can mature as early as  months old so he may be getting territorial and spraying at that age. Hypoallergenic doesnt mean the animal wont cause allergies just that it may be better for allergies. Even then no breed of cat has been proven to by hypoallergenic except for Siberians and even then its a gamble. So the short of it is no they arent truly hypoallergenic.This seems very sketchy to me. The first owner mistreated it then gave it away before it was even out of kitten stage? Why did the first owner give it away? Why didnt they give the papers to the next owner? Why not give the cat back to the breeder? Why buy a kitten anyways if one was just going to mistreat it and give it away? I guess it doesnt matter as long as the cat is happy and healthy in its new home. Just seems like a very complicated story for someone who needs to get rid of a kitten.,cats,cgm9pvm,1,t5_2qhta

Theres nothing you can do to really help him through it other than to remove the threat. Maybe try keeping him indoors for a week or two. Praise and reassure him and see if his demeanor improves. It can be pretty traumatic for a cat who has felt safe and secure inside to suddenly find himself outside in a world full of threats. Also if he isnt up to date onhis vaccinations a trip to the vet is in order. Fighting is how many serious diseases are transmitted. Good luck! ,cats,chcqyh4,3,t5_2qhta

1215888,0,t1_ci6ehrs,I appreciate that your intentions are good you sound very kind hearted and that bit about your grandpa is awful wow but TNR is not inhumane. Its the most humane method of managing feral cats that we have and the traps dont hurt them. The cats may be scared but its better for them in the long run than remaining unvaccinated and such. A TNR group or rescue that traps the kittens will have then checked out by a vet vaccinated as appropriate for their age and spayedneutered if theyre big enough. If these kittens look small or thin they could be orphaned and need intervention if theyre going to survive. Google some local TNR groups in your area it really is a good system. They arent rounding up cats to kill them or anything which used to be more common. TNR lets them continue with their lives as usual.,cats,ci6emcz,2,t5_2qhta

Yes you can teach him not to jump on places through clicker trainingwhich can take a while so you have to have patience but hes more than likely doing it to get your attention. The solution is to put him down from the counter and dont engage him. Dont even look at him when you get him off the counter. He will realize that hes not getting attention and will stop. But what really helps is getting his energy out through intense play twothree times a day. I mean playtime that results in him panting on the floor. Kittens need a lot of activity. If hes bored hes going to get destructive. This is more than likely what is happening besides the striving for attention. Honestly if you cant deal with your kitten without getting angry and resorting to violencesame goes for your father then you shouldnt have animals. I dont care if it was a few times or once. You DO NOT hit an animal. Also dont play with him with your handsfeet. Whomever had him first obviously did which is why he attacks hands and feet. Thats a big nono.,cats,cifvchm,0,t5_2qhta

She didnt mind doing it as soon as he was over  lbs since often its most convenient and ensures that the cat will actually be neutered. Having to make a separate trip after adopting really decreases the chance of someone actually going through with it because life just gets busy. She told me that its not a bad idea to wait long enough that theyre strong but not so long that they start to get annoying by spraying etc. for an exclusively indoor cat with no chance to impregnate another cat.,cats,ciyqwv2,1,t5_2qhta
1455964,0,t1_ciy7tbh,FIV is like HIV while it leads to immunosuppression a wellkept cat will live many years before having complications. It is typically transmitted by cat fights bloodtoblood.FeLV is also a retrovirus that can cause cancer usually lymphoma leukemia is rare despite the name but more often causes illness by immunosuppression. It makes cats sick much more quickly we often see kittens or young adults sick with this. Unfortunately it is more easily transmitted as well cats can contract it by sharing the same water or food possibly through grooming each other as well.While both diseases have vaccines the FIV vaccine is not very effective and not very common the FeLV vaccine on the other hand is exceptionally effective if given before exposure. The FIV vaccine also has the problem of causing a cat to test positive on the test that most vets use which is another factor in why its not a common vaccine to carry let alone recommend.,cats,ciys3pa,3,t5_2qhta

If it came to this for me I would just make sure shes as comfortable as possible by getting a vets prescribed pain medication.The only other alternatives are probably therapies you can find online like moving your cats leg a certain way and long walks outdoors.I will be praying for the best for you and your cat.

1537772,0,t1_cj8zmau,Not even close to the same level of rarity.  Heres a post I made a few months ago regarding male and female cat coat colorsIgnoring mutations that lighten or darken fur color the two main cat colors are black and red white and white spotting mittens tuxedo patterns etc are caused by different non sex linked genes.  Black is the default.  However a cat can also have red pigmentation carried on the X chromosome.  Like humans female cats have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y.  Because females have two X chromosomes they experience X inactivation meaning only one X is expressed at a time.  This means a male cat with an X with no red coloration is black and a male with an X with red coloration is red.  In females a cat with two red Xs is red and no red Xs is black.  However if they have one red X and one X without the red gene they would express both colors in different places because of X inactivation.  Ill try to sum it up.  Lets say the bold X is carrying the red coloration.MalesXY gt BlackXY gt RedFemalesXX gt BlackXX gt RedXX or XX gt CalicoTortoiseshellMale cats can be calico but its extremely rare caused by abnormalities such as Klinefelters Syndrome XXY sex chromosomes or chimerismSourcesi like catsi really like catsi even made this tiny cat,cats,cj919an,5,t5_2qhta

I cried the whole time. I hugged her and laid on the floor with her. It was really hard. I honestly think it was harder before than after. We cried a lot after too. Your kitty knows you love her. Spend as much time giving her love as you can and remember that you are doing whats best for her. So she doesnt suffer. Know that she will pass feeling loved and thats all shell know. I waited till we got my pups ashes back and then a got a new member of the family to soak up all the love that my sweet old one used to get.

You can get some of those plastic jingle balls as well  unless your cat is a compulsive chewer they are more than sturdy enough. My cats are huge fans of the Turbo Cat Scratcher toy. The round scratching pad can be flipped over and replaced easily. A good scratching post or cat tree is a must if you have the space. Stay away from toys that involve long strings or cloth that can fray into threads she can swallow cats dont really have the ability to spit things out the way humans can wrong muscles and mouth shape so if she gets a thread in her mouth and swallows it it can lead to really serious problems for her and expensive vet bills for you. Of course fishing pole toys while shes supervised are great!If you want cloth toys or blankets microfleece works well  its strong and stretchy and doesnt fray easily.

1696730,0,t1_cjst9yp,I knew this. This was why I was upset and searching for my black cat. It was the day before my seventeenth birthdaymy birthday is October th. He came home the next day just not in one piece. Someone had captured and tortured him he was still wearing his collar and tags. While doing that to a stray would be equally horrific knowingly doing it to someones family member adds an extra level of sickness. Firecrackers had been set off in his anus and mouth. Both back legs were shattered. His entire lower jaw was gone but he had managed to yowl after dragging himself over the fence. I was initially excited when I heard him then I saw what was left. He purred all the way to the shelter I held him as euthanasia was administered. It is one of the worst things I have ever witnessed even in the following years as I have worked for rescues and animal clinics. The memory still makes me cry at age . I never wanted a black cat again thinking it would remind me of him. Three years ago a stray black kitten adopted me. Moose is my best friend and one of the sweetest cats I have ever known. And just a few weeks ago while house hunting I found this little fellow emancipated dehydrated and abandoned at a vacant house in the  degree heat. This is Nigel the newest family member. Tldr  I had a black cat tortured to death around Halloween. It was horrible. Now I have new black kitties. They stay inside. ,cats,cjt1b5k,8,t5_2qhta

If with my paws I could do the same this is what Id ask.To a poor and lonely stray Id giveMy happy home.My bowl and cozy bed soft pillows and all my toys.The lap which I loved so much.The hand that stroked my fur and the sweet voice which spoke my name.Id will to the sad scared shelter cat the place I had in my humans loving heart of which there seemed no bounds.So when I die please do not say I will never have a pet again for the loss and pain is more than I can stand. Instead go find an unloved dog or cat one whose life has held no joy or hope and give MY place to HIM.This is the only thing I can giveThe love I left behind.Author Unknown,cats,cjwqr3d,12,t5_2qhta

1735510,0,t1_cjxs8pw,Were definitely a long way from putting her down at this point. She seems to be responding well to the medicine and she has mostly left her tail alone.I wouldnt say shes living in fear at all. Weve had her for almost  months and this is the first time anything serious has happened. If it continues we might have to look at a antidepressant or maybe even amputating the tail as a lastditch effort. Of course if her quality of life is miserable putting her down might be the humane thing to do but were a long way from that still. Thanks for the feedback!,cats,cjxxbm6,2,t5_2qhta
1736239,0,t3_2ebuda,How often should she eat ?  Wet or dry? Wet xx a day shes a baby. Dry just free feed till she is older.What should be the portion ? She wont over eat till she is an adult. Kittens eat when they are hungry. Let her eat till she stops. Should I buy a cat house to keep her entertained when me or my sister are not around?She needs scratching post things or she will find some in your furniture. Window seats or cat trees are fun too. You dont have to go crazy but she may want to have a good hidey hole and a place up high to watch the house. Floor toys are good too as are kitty fishing toys for you to play with her. Her age will be fine if she is eating and using the litter box. Kittens are very high energy I would recommend getting her a friend they play together and wear each other out. The difference between  kitten and  is night and day in interaction and needing your attention. The cost was negligible. ,cats,cjy0ms8,2,t5_2qhta

1958855,0,t1_ckp8f0y,If she is unpredictable then it will only get worse if she has kittens to protect. I would not do that. If you want a kitten then I would consider getting a pair of very young siblings and introducing them slowly. IME indoor cats do seem to be happier and healthier with a friend.When she seems overstimulated during play then just put down the toy or whatever youre playing with and sit quietly. She will most likely then go somewhere and either lie down or start to groom. If she does that then give her a treat and leave her alone. Any time you can end play time without scratches or biting give her a little treat and she will start to see that there is a reward for playing well. When she scratches randomly what does her body language look like? Is the fur on her back sticking up? Is her tail relaxed swishing softly side to side or lashing back and forth like a whip? Do her pupils seem to be too large? Does she make eye contact?,cats,ckp8swg,1,t5_2qhta

2006057,0,t3_2ho04w,Please forgive the formatting this comment. I am on mobileOk just to clear some stuff up My cat is indoor only. She loves using her scratchers. I only trim the sharp tips because she gets caught in the carpet or any piece of fabric really except for her thumbs because she has an extra digit really close to it and the two claws grow side by side and they curl up into her skin. The nerves for these are actually quite far back. Finally the clippers I have are the scissor or plier type really sharp. I dont apply much force. My cat was abandoned by someone who moved out. She was living in a home but apparently no one acknowledged her presence. At two years old she didnt have any shots wasnt spayed and had a bad case of ear mites. Ive had her since February and she trusts me a lot more now. Shes whiny and shell make faces at you but shes actually alright. She just wants attention and Im more than happy to give it.,cats,ckuxeza,2,t5_2qhta

Take the food bowl away to make sure she wont eat anything until that hour has passed as its necessary in order for the supplement to work as intended. I usually get mine from Amazon because its where I usually find the best price.As for food let me suggest Canidae Dry Food the wet food is good too and your cat will probably like it but the cans are small and expensive. The more I learn about Prescription Pet Food Diets and what they contain and dont contain along with my firsthand experience with regard to them the less enthused I am about resorting to them as an alternative.My cat is on the Denamarin currently and I switched him over to Canidae dry food last month and Im seeing promising results so far. Also the Canidae Dry Food doesnt have any of the crap that tends not to be good for pets. Its all natural.,cats,ckwzt4i,2,t5_2qhta

2096477,0,t3_2iwz9a,Not a vet or expert just a longtime cat owner so go with what yall are comfortable doing neutering if hes not been altered yet will help some. Also stop feeding him canned food so often its really not that great for them not to mention expensive. She can start by mixing dry and wet food to start weaning them and after about two weeks move to only dry food. I feed my cat wet food once a week to give her some oils and as a treat. Your roommate can also slowly shift their feeding times forwards or backwards to a more reasonable time. Start moving it back or forward  minutes every  or  days until its at a more reasonable hour. Try also feeding the cats in separate parts of the houseapartment and leave their food plates out but with a certain amount of food on them so they dont overeat so they might feel like they dont have to gobble down the food. There are also pheromone plugins and collars that supposedly help calm the cats down so place them in various parts of the houseapartment. I have no idea about negative or positive reenforcement but in my experience negative reenforcement with an angryaggressive cat only makes it meaner.  I previously previously as in hes dead now had a very aggressive altered male DSH he bit through my hand and I still have scars from that and on my ankles from where he attacked so Ive learned by trial and error.,cats,cl6b4fk,1,t5_2qhta

I get a lot of supplements from her to help with my cats with URIs and my two FELVs. I have seen wonders with some of them. One of the main things I use for URI flare ups is called Congaplex. Not even sure what all is in it but it helps and then I use lysine fairly regularly for my rescue and sanctuary.FIVs can live a long time. I dont think they have terrible odds against them like the FELV cats. Rescuing a cat like her is so rewarding too.

2536961,0,t3_2oqbe3,Trouble is a well bred cat will cost a cheap cat of any breed will be bred and reared cheaply. You get what you pay for. If you want to go for a specific breed look at proper breeders. There isnt some breeder somewhere churning out countless cheap kittens for the pet market but doing it well from healthy sane breeding animals. Try looking at breed specific rescues or just go to a general cat rescue and spend time with the cats and see if there is one you dont react so badly with. There are several breeds which can be less allergenic though nothing is gunaranteed but you will pay breeder prices for any of them. Be wary of any cat being rehomed as a pure breed if it doesnt have papers more than likely it will be a look a like and wont have any of the characteristics of a pure breed. Just did a quick search this breeder is in Michigan and charges  which I suspect is the standard price for a pure breed kitten in the USA ,cats,cmpptg5,1,t5_2qhta

Overweight cats are more prone to this condition.

2591144,0,t1_cmwjrds,My little siamese girl Juliet went through something extremely similar diarrhea and vomiting nonstop. I took her almost daily to the vet for almost a month and after being given special food and variety of meds incuding antiparasitics it wasnt getting any better. She was reduced to a pitiful skinny weak shell of her former self.When we finally got an xray the vet decided to open her up and see what exactly was a dark spot visible in the images. He not only found out she had megacolon and liver failure she also had a small tumor in her duodenum. He sorta drained all the gas and nasty stuff from her intestines but advised against any more surgery as the procedure would most certainly kill her given her weakness and age. The vet told us it was best to put her to sleep.I was ready to let her go especially seeing her suffer so terribly but my sister and mom werent on the same page. Cue a couple of weeks later and shes actually a bit better until she starts throwing up again. Now my sister was ready as well. We kept procrastinating not sure why but the fact is we never got around to putting her to sleep maybe because we just couldnt accept her being gone.That last episode was back in early September the symptoms have stopped shes hungrier and fatter than ever she wakes us up in the middle of the night to get our attention her energy is ridiculous even her fur is shinier and prettier... no explanation as to why.We also dropped a lot of money on her even after our hopes had been shattered but she pulled through and to this day I have no idea what happened. I sincerely hope you get to hear good news and your little one makes a turnaround.,cats,cmwsskd,6,t5_2qhta

2765696,0,t1_cnhxaqt,Its a fun experience! Though you may not want to keep them all haha...our foster momma cat had  kittens and as it turned out she liked to be a solo kitty so she was kinda rough on her kittens especially when they got older. Momma cats can actually go into heat while still nursing and then while the kittens are a little young to be fixed so she got spayed before her babies got fixed. You could talk to a rescue group in your area a lot of them pull cats or find pregnant ones too far along to be spayed and theyll give you any support you might need including finding homes for the kittens. We fostered them and kept  of the kittens as we already had  cats and the rest have great homes. Its rewarding to know that other people get to enjoy a kitty you helped raise. Side noteuninvited advise do not give youngish kittens shreds wet food while weaning...we had one choke while eating and is thankfully okay but it was terrifying and keep the strings and hairbands far from kitty reach! And touch their paws and trim their nails once theyre crawling around etc...it makes a lifetime of claw trimming SO easy!

Something similar happened to my cat when she was young and her disappearance was even more mysterious because we lived at the top of a three story condo complex and her only point of escape would have been our balcony. We figured she might have taken a tumble off the balcony which my other cat had done before in her overeagerness to catch a bird on a nearby branch and run off somewhere so we spent the next four or five days looking for her. Signs asking neighbors the whole bit. Then our downstairs neighbor came to our door to inform us theyd heard meowing when they went out on their balcony and upon investigation saw a cat matching my cats description running across the roof of our buildings carport. Turns out my cat had spent the entire week hiding in that roof ignoring every call opened can and shaken bag of food wed passed by with. My dad had to climb up there to coax her out and she slashed his arms to hell for his trouble. Dumb cat. Still loved her. ,cats,cnsmnip,1,t5_2qhta

That was when I made it an point to learn more about the healthiest kinds of diet for a cat.And No Grain Dry Food was what I found to be the right solution as well among other things.And you can never go wrong with Fancy Feast Wet Canned Food especially the Classic Flavors in the Green Box.,cats,cpedj6m,2,t5_2qhta

3624918,0,t1_cq5b415,Of course! I just wrote a long research paper on it and thought everyone should know. Unfortunately my professor told me that her cat recently died of renal failure and that she never even thought about what I had stated in my paper about cats  big cats especially  needing LOTS of water. Much more water than you would think raw flesh contains  or more water just like our bodies and so dry kibble really messes with their systems after a bit. Instinct will do your rescue well.  My lovely Burmese tuxedo has been eating Instinct for a few years now and my vet comments on how his coat is shiny hes really playful and friendly and hes not aggressive at all. In fact when hes under the bed thats my cue that something is probably wrong. Its an incredibly easy brand  they suggest you feed your cat a little variety and so you can buy the kibble the wet or the raw and feed it to them anytime for all life stages thats another thing I outlined in my paper  life stages is kind of a marketing ploy. Again think of a big tiger. Their diets dont necessarily change. Kittens need much more food  body weight ratio than adult cats and senior cats need even less but at every stage it should be dense with nutrients. Good luck! I hope you forge a long loving relationship with your kitty.  ,cats,cq5guig,2,t5_2qhta

Shes also lost weight in the last few daysweeks due to not eating.As far as the vet goes he isnt certain it is a tumor and he was unable to take Xrays to confirm because she wouldnt stay still. He would need to sedate her but hes hesitant to do that because of her age and because she also has a heart murmur so he wanted to have Chewie examined by a cardiologist before putting her under anesthesia. In the end all this would cost me close to  just to get a certain diagnosis.He did not recommend letting her suffer but without being certain what her ailment was we werent going to jump straight to putting her to sleep.,cats,cq7599k,-1,t5_2qhta

Chips help immensely if he gets picked up by animal control but if a family finds him they would have to take him to a vet or shelter to find his home. Putting your phone number on the tag lets them just give you a quick call and you can go pick him up. My cat used to get lost a lot and this is how we found her every time. Fingers crossed that kitty makes it home safely! It is very common for them to find theyre way home on their own when they get hungry enough. I assume youve already put up posters called shelters etc. but if you havent message me and Ill let you know everything Ive used to find my cat when she went missing.

Its a tough thing to fight because of how it snowballs  they dont want to eatdrink because they feel bad but then not eatingdrinking makes them feel worse etc. Good luck Ive been there and it was tough but its a serious problem if it goes too long.   ,cats,crvsaar,1,t5_2qhta

4276347,0,t3_39u7dc,Urine dilution appears to be helpful in the treatment of feline idiopathic cystitis FIC because it decreases the concentration of substances in the urine that may be irritating to the bladder mucosa. Numerous ways to dilute urine have been investigated in cats but one of the safest and most effective is to feed a cannedfood diet. Other dietary modifications have been used to dilute urine including sodium supplementation. Although sodiumsupplemented diets are helpful in cats with FIC they are contraindicated in cats with underlying renal disease. Highly acidic diets are not recommended because highly acidic urine may increase sensory nerve fiber transmission in the bladder and increase pain perception. Regardless of treatment clinical signs of FIC usually spontaneously resolve in  days. Unfortunately FIC recurs within  mo in approximately half of the cats that experience spontaneous remission and multiple recurrences are possible.The underlying cause of this disorder is unknown although anxiety and altered neurohormonal factors have been implicated.Because the cause of feline interstitial cystitis is unknown the goal of treatment is to reduce the severity and frequency of episodes of cystitis. Therapeutic considerations include reduction of stress through environmental changes dietary adjustments eg use of canned preparations pheromones applied topically in the environment and analgesics eg butorphanol .. mgkg PO bidtid. Other medications eg amitriptyline .. mgcat PO once or twice daily clomipramine . mgkgday PO fluoxetine  mgkgday PO have yielded mixed results.If your cat has a bacterial urinary tract infection then abtibiotics are needed.

That may be our fault in the end our litter boxes are tall since even our  year old cat is still very agile. They contains mess better but I think theyre too tall for Kitty.  Well have to get a shorter sided one for her or find a good large enclosed with a flapper door kind.A kinda sad note though when we were in the shelter today it looks as though shes going to have a full tooth extraction scheduled at some point. I had mentioned her terrible looking teeth when we first took her out to evaluate her so the kennel tech passed the word along and the vet apparently said for her health she likely needs it done and will be on a life of wet food.

And as for diabetes unless youre eating cereal  times a day and somehow doing so without consuming most of the milk then the amount of CARBS a cat could drink is insignificant compared to the amount of CARBS in the cats dry food.All sugars are carbs but not all carbs are sugars.

Sometimes I wont let him and just respond with a loudish no as soon as he starts a howl. This seems to cut his howling down to a minute or two.Other times I let him out and walk with him while he patrols the hallway. Hell sniff around and eventually settle down. Sometimes Ill stay with him other times Ill prop the door open with a shoe so he can let himself back in.

This litter helps with that and a good technique is to tilt the box on all  sides to sift and show you the  clumps so you can remove them first and its easier and quicker with the  clumps left,cats,cuwwvhv,1,t5_2qhta
5074402,0,t1_cux2fnm,My cat is the strangest little thing. She hates having her stomach pet or being held... Unless I hold her upside down and rub her neck. She goes absolutely soft and relaxes and starts purring like crazy. She could be pissed at me and yowling and if I pick her up like that and rub her neck suddenly Im her favorite again.So we take advantage of that to cut her nails. I hold her and rub her neck and my mum trims her nails. She barely reacts except for when my mum has to push her nails out of her toes a bit to cut them. Its so strange.,cats,cuxnodz,5,t5_2qhta

5200117,0,t3_3m5wyf,i adopted a kitty like that! on petfinder or wherever you post the listing i would indicate that the cat is shy but very affectionate and will require a quiet stressfree home and a couple weeks of patience in a new environment but once shes comfortable she will give headbutts and snuggles and make biscuits etc. thats what attracted me to my cat. when i have visitors in my house i tell them to approach her but not facing her and dont look directly at her i.e. sit parallel to her not perpendicular and sit low on the floor by her hiding spot and then i advise them to slowly move towards her still not facing her and hold a hand out so she can sniff then pet her gently near the base of the tail so she feels less threatened than if you reach straight for her head. i have had luck with people doing the slow blink and even just closing their eyes while petting her too esp if she makes eye contact. though if potential adopters are scared away by the behavior at the pet store despite you telling them that shell warm up and be lovely later i think its likely they wont make it through the first week or two where shes still going to be hiding and will return her. before i adopted her my cat was actually returned to the rescue by a potential foster the next day bc they were freaked out by the cat freaking out if that makes sense.  sorry about the length! i have a soft spot for shy cats.,cats,cvct2lq,1,t5_2qhta

5500027,0,t1_cwemgrq,The lore of why black cats are considered evil is kind of scattered.  A few places to look at are the Scottish folk lore of Cat Sith not joking on the name who was a monsterously huge black cat who was believed to go around and steal the souls of the recently dead before the Gods could claim them.   In the Middle Ages black cats were commonly associated with the Black Death and had their population massively eradicated to try and prevent the plague that was killing people by the scores.  Ironically killing the black cats allowed the true culprits of The Plague rats to explode in population.Lastly black cats were associated with witches during the s.  This was spread due to the fact that many witches were seen feeding and caring for stray and feralalley cats.  The color black often associated with witchcraftevilLucifer was then associated to these feral cats.  This lead to people seeing the black cats as the familiar of the witch who would go out and do the witches bidding from afar.  Of course this is all ridiculous nonsense.  A black cat is no different from any other cat.,cats,cweoi2y,10,t5_2qhta

5748618,0,t3_3sahgx,I highly recommend you adopt dont buy. Heres why your a first time cat owner...which means that you should not get a kitten. Kittens can turn out to have any personality regardless of breed. Kittens are not for beginners. For one its a minimum  year commitment. People say they get this but many dont fully embrace how long that is. I never recommend getting one kitten. Always get two because like puppies kittens learn through social interactions with litter mates. Kittens sleep and play. They will want to play for hours including in the middle of the night. Do you want to get up at am to play because your kitten doesnt want to play alone? Most people dont. Also kittens who grow up alone can develop behavioral  issues like biting. Kittens learn not to bite hard when playing because their litter mates cry with pain when bitten. Without learning experiences like these kittens can miss out on important experiences that might effect them for life. So on that note I should mention how hard raising two kittens can be financially and emotionally. You say you want a NFC because of looks and personality. I can tell you that the personalities and temperaments described in cats vs dogs are very different. Dog breeds vary widely in personality where as cats dont as much. For example sphinx cats have a reputation for being very sweet but many of them are not. The reputation that a breed of cat has does not stay true like the reputation of dog breeds. So if you want a NFC because of their temperament dont count on your cat sticking to that reputation. Also NFC are not low maintenance. They are low maintenance Im comparison to other very long haired cats. Purebreds are also prone to illnesses more do than other cats which is more money and time. You also have to consider the financial and physical needs of any cat. For one food. You want to buy good food for your cat not supermarket brand junk for your cat. S healthy diet will save you money on health issues down the road. My cat is fed Acana which costs me  a month. You can go as low as  a month for a decent diet. Not including wet food. Cats have medical expenses too. Indoor cats need two shots a year and one yearly checkup minimum. Monthly flea meds are around  for  months. Even indoor cats need these fleas will find a way. Then theres emotional needs. Cats high up safe places. This makes cats happy and feel secure. Cats who hide under and behind things are not comfortable in the home. A cat tower and scratching post ate necessary. You dont want to declaw your cat. If you want info on why I can help just ask. Providing proper places to scratch will prevent your furniture from being used. Cats also take time. You need to play with your cat an average of  minutes hour and a half a day depending on the cats personality. Many cats are not happy with playing on their own so daily play is important. Now let me sell you on rescuing an adult cat. We rescued a  year old tortie named Millie. She loves to play more than most kittens Ive met. Shes cuter and goofier and best of all we knew who she was when we met her. I didnt just fall in love with her looks I fell in love with her personality. With a kitten you simply dont know. Millie is humble. Shes grateful for her home. She spend  years of her life without one and because of that she shoes me everyday how much she loves me. Shes grateful for all her things. Thats something you wont find with a kitten.  Millie has another  years on her which is still a long time. Thats enough for me and after rescuing her I wouldnt have it any other way. Ive had lots of kittens in my life. Lots of cats. None has been as special as Millie. I dont know if Ill ever want another kitten again. I have a bond better with Millie than any kitten Ive raised. Tips on looking for the right one be patient. Youre going to think youve found the one the first day you go into a rescue. But more likely than not its just infatuation. Every time you visit youll find one you want to take home. This isnt the one. The cat for you is the one that connects with you not just you liking it. Its not the one that rubs on you or purrs or plays with you. Its the one that looks at you like its been waiting for you its whole life. Even when you find it dont take it home. Go visit another shelter or two and after meeting more cats you still cant get that one out of your head thats when you know its the one. I should mention that you can find BEAUTIFUL long haired cats at no mill shelters. My local one had two amazing ragdolls last week. Blue eyes and all. Its easy to find a gorgeous long haired cat at rescues. Try petfinder.com.Good luck! If you have any questions Ill be happy to answer as best I can.

5987227,0,t3_3xeekb,My parents had a cat that didnt crave much attention at all. When I was a kid we had kids that always wanted to be close to you always wanting to be petted or played with but this cat wasnt like that  he wasnt unfriendly but just perfectly happy to be alone all day.Hed find comfy spots and hed always be happiest if not disturbed too much and would often just sleep seemingly blissfully unaware if youre there or not.Unless youd open a book or magazine in his presence. Then itd be a matter of minutes before hes sitting on the book staring at your face and demanding attention. It was always so funny to me the way he seemed to only want your attention when he got jealous that you were focusing too hard on something else. The rest of the time he didnt care much  if you went to read in another room he wouldnt follow he just didnt want you to pay attention to something else in his presence.I understand that the behavior of interrupting your reading is very common in cats but it just really stood out to me with this cat because of his personality. He was the only cat Ive known that would normally be so indifferent to your presence so it was such a stark contrast when hed suddenly be so interested in spending time with you as soon as you open a book.,cats,cy4ggby,6,t5_2qhta

Its unlikely youll find an exotic cat at a shelter but sometimes breeders insist that if an owner no longer wants their cat they need to contact the breeder first before giving it away. With many Savannah breeders it will actually be in the contract reason being owning a Savannah is not for everyone.

Anyone caught spraying gets a scare and chased back outside while we clean the spot with some enzyme cleaner mom got thats made for accidents according to the bottle its for anyone with cats dogs andor toddlers... which made me laugh so its not just diluted and wont prompt further spraying. Cat pans are checked and cleaned if needed two or three times a day. The cats themselves are clean of course anyone found with a noticeable odor gets examined for the source in case its coming from an infection or something.If theyre staying the night theyre screwed anyway though  best you can do is make sure the bedclothes are clean and fresh the rooms been dusted and vacuumed thoroughly and that its a nocat zone until further notice.,cats,cyga8kw,-1,t5_2qhta

6084412,0,t3_3t1w6k,I just stumbled upon this post! I got my himalayan ragdoll mix from kijiji actually  basically ebay craigslist. My heart was SET on a long haired kitten and I went back and forth between shelters for weeks. I was on every waiting list in the nearby area for a long haired kitten. Its been two years and they still havent called... Fortunately for me a mama cat gave birth to a litter of ten and her owners just couldnt get rid of the all the kittens fast enough. I figured they were headed to the shelter anyways might as well grab him. Total cost?  Mama was a champion showline persian and father ragdoll accidentally left his mark Around here adoption costs are  anyways so I didnt feel bad paying a bit more to get exactly what I wanted  and I lucked out all the couch potato persian goodness combined with ragdoll affection amp playfulness has made for a spectacular cat. Seriously my friends amp family are all obsessed with the little guy.The only thing I have to warn you about is the high chance of ringworm. Its very common in persians due to their long hair and squished faces which makes it more difficult for them to clean themselves. Owners often become immune to it and wont realize their cats are carriers. My kitten ended up being covered in it hence covering me in it hence having him live in the bathroom for the first six months of our life together  The FIRST thing you should do once you get your persian kitty is have the vet check it for ringworm just to be on the safeside and the preemptive testing is free! They just shine a woods lamp over the fur. If they do find anything a culture doesnt cost too much to run.,cats,cyh5anc,1,t5_2qhta

I personally prefer cats to kittens and suggest a cat for people who have less time less patience or who have young kids.  Note that every cat is different but in general a visit to the shelter will help you learn about them note that cats shed more in the shelter than they would at home due to stress.  It takes about  weeks for a new cat to adjust to a new home.,cats,cyrxvga,3,t5_2qhta

6268641,0,t1_cz260bx,Some cats just hate it! And thats fine not all cats really need to be walked. I just like that other people even consider the idea especially over letting their cat just roam around outdoors without supervision. I volunteer with a local animal rescue organization which works closely with our shelter and my position involves taking care of shelter cats up for adoption through a local pet store. One of my duties is to take the cats for walks around the store at least the ones that will cooperate. Some of the cats are like Hells yeah lets get outta this cage! and other cats are like Nope nope nope I dont know what that thing is but Im not letting it touch me and you cant make me! and thats fine. If theyre really opposed to it I just leave them alone. Ive had some success with giving them a treat every time I put the leash on them as well as letting them smell the leash before I even try to put it on them the first time. And some of them do what your cat does where they just flop over and act like theyre either sad or dead seriously they just go limp like if I think they died Ill leave them alone lol and if I carry them out of the cage and set them on the floor theyll eventually open up to the idea. And toys can help too if I take them out on the leash and then use a toy to get them distracted and energetic... But some cats never come around to the idea so I just dont push the issue with them anymore. ,cats,cz26ao3,3,t5_2qhta

6273018,0,t1_cz2nqul,I actually know exactly what youre talking about. I had my grey tabby princess then one horribly cold winter I had a young orange boy come up to me on my porch and just be so friendly. So I took him in and he was a wonderful sweet and friendly cat. Very very stupid but very sweet and friendly. But the girl cat HATED him and she beat on him every chance she got. She literally hated him until the day she died. That sucked but I did get to have that little orange kitten and save him from freezing. So while I understand that its important to you that the two cats get along sometimes you just have to accept that they wont. I spent ten years dealing with one cat who hated the other and it sucked. But when the girl died I adopted a sweet little girl who adored the boy. ,cats,cz2o6h5,2,t5_2qhta

6562862,0,t1_czxpi7q,Exactly. A friend of mine ended up with a total stray who was DUMPED OUTSIDEshes declawed a total inside cat and actively afraid of the outsideIf someone knocks on the door she hides from the human until she knows who it is she was basically a dark grey cat when he found her and then after a bath she was a light beige cat with long fluffy fur. She was beautifulbut some jerkhole didnt take good care of her or got rid of her.I think some people just are dumbyes you can buy a cat from a breeder but why would you do that when there are so many cats who are in need of love that already have set personalities that you know are good? I love kittens so I follow a lot of fosters on instagram to get my kitten fix and I have  adult cats of my own that are basically two big babies.,cats,czy5ksd,6,t5_2qhta

With that being said one issue was that they werent eating it which factored in with the cost made it expensive. When I finally budged and bought a formula from the brand that was ok for them to eat together there was no significant weight change over the course of time approx.  mths. I plan to speak with my vet again in regards to the brand but I guess my first issue to address is portion sizing.,cats,czywg3d,1,t5_2qhta

6627239,0,t1_d04t0dw,If you follow the doctors advice she should be fine but if you decide not to do anything because you cant afford it she could die.If your vet felt it was fine to go a day or two before scheduling more tests then Im sure shell be fine until then. If it wasnt treatable Im sure he wouldve told you that too but theres no way to tell what could be going on until you get those xrays.Recently my cat was diagnosed with diabetes I was told I would have to change his food now costs x as much and give him shots twice a day insulin could cost up to  a month. This included  doctors visits that cost about  each with tests. In the end I only had to give him shots for about  weeks until he went into remission so it wasnt as costly as I originally thought. The only way to know is to go through the testing and see whats really going on but delaying it will only make things worse and more costly in the end.,cats,d04tavu,1,t5_2qhta

He started out with the named Wicket but I would sing to him while I was in the bath Wicki Wicki Wicki and eventually that turned into Piggy Piggy Piggy.  He loved going outside and hanging out on our porch and would always come back in when he was done.  Sitting on the porch is going to be a lot different without him.  He loved eating grass and biting my toes in the morning to get me to turn the water in the bathroom sink on for him to drink out of.  I fear my toes wont miss him much.He started losing weight a few weeks ago and just plain looked miserable last weekend so I took him to the vet and they discovered a large tumor.  After looking at the treatment options and the vet realistically giving me less than a  chance that we could even make him more comfortable I made the decision that it was his time.  He just looked ready and worn out.  I got him to purr with me while we were there so that was nice.  Anyways the house just isnt the same without him.,cats,d0sjuja,2,t5_2qhta

Some things to watch out for cats can die if they dont pee. Its got to do with a chemical in their urine so if ur kitty is trying to go to the bathroom but nothings coming out or if its grunting while trying to have a bowel movement take it to the vet right away! We associate grunting with being constipated but theres a fair chance its because its having trouble peeing.  Cats hide their sicknesses well so make sure u pay attention and if they are acting strange stranger than usual a trip to the doc wouldnt hurt to be safe.  Please dont ever declaw it.

You put it in carpet etc. youll have to wash her a couple times a week and maybe find a safe lotion or anti itch cream you can use on her. I heard dawn soap works the best on washing them.

Its been about three weeks and I think about those last moments all the time.  I am always wondering if there was anything that could have been done.

Theres a small portable speaker right in front of her. Last night she was rubbing all over it with her neck and head.Before if I sit her on my lap she gets really really angry. Shell sit there furious. Or sometimes she will stare at me with a mean look. Just sit there staring endlessly with the look of how dare you. But now shes no longer mad.Also before I moved to my new place. When I first started playing with her I was petting her forehead. She seemed fine and relaxed but then she attacked me and started hissing. Since I moved to my new place she scratched and bit at me while I was petting her for a bit. Or she would bite at me for some reason but she never once actually really tried to bite me. Just bite at me. Now she doesnt do any of it. No biting or scratching me.,cats,d3y7rb8,1,t5_2qhta

It has never been much of a struggle to vacuum it off of anything so im not sure if it would go as easily for you or not.here is the only vacuum attachment i ever use to collect cat fur. it works very well in my experience so i would recommend grabbing one if you dont have it already.

The vet said a double dose may be easier and better.  My cat didnt have much control of her butt and she sort of slipped around the car.  She fell face first into a small hole in the stuff we had stored in the back seat and I had to scoop her out.  I would not recommend meds as they create new problems and in my case didnt really calm down the cat.Btw Im the cat scarf commenter above and Id take the wailing cat scarf over a wobbly drugged up cat for any trip.,cats,d4rv8wa,2,t5_2qhta

8249461,0,t3_4set1y,When I woke up this morning my cat Wilson  year and  months was extremely quiet and refusing to eat or drink. As well his back legs were seized and he was extremely bloated. Fearing the worst my fiance and i brought him to the Veterinary Hospital where he was admitted immediately. It turns around that he had kidney crystals and around Thursday or Friday a blockage had occurred preventing him from peeing. This was a total shock to us because he had been running around and playing and being goofy all weekend! The buildup of urine was causing his body to be overloaded with electrolytes and potassium which can cause extremely dangerous problems with kidney and heart functions. I was so scared. Surgery was on the table to remove the stone... but luckily after almost an hour of draining and  vets helping they were able to remove the stone and get his urine flowing again. To get an idea of how big the stone was this sort of procedure usually only takes FIVE MINUTES and  doctor. What caused this? According to the vets a variety of factors lack of hydration how much he was eating etc. The biggest cause however was stress likely related to the last minute move we had to undergo last month.Wilson is spending two more nights under observation. He is going to be okay but this is a life changing event for him. He will have to go on a strictly controlled diet for the rest of his already tough life he only has  legs one was amputated before we got him as a baby and we will have to be encouraging him to constantly be going to the bathroom. We also have to keep a careful eye on him as this does have a high chance of reoccurring. To all my fellow cat owners pay attention to ANY signs your cats give off. We had noticed Wilson hovering over his litter over the weekend but we attributed this to him having troubles peeing due to his missing limb not to mention the usual cat weirdness. According to the Vet cats are NOTORIOUS for not showing symptoms of illness and also not drinking enough stubborn cuties so always monitor and enforce water intake. And whenever undergoing a massive life upheaval like a move always show extreme care to your pets. We tried our very best to make the move as easy for him as possible but it was still clearly a traumatic experience for him! Pretty scary morning and coming that close to losing Wilson was amazingly hard on my fiance and I. But he is a survivor and is on his way to a speedy recovery. Thank goodness because I love this boy with my whole heart ,cats,d58qlm0,3,t5_2qhta

My guess was that she was between .Thats not really really old for a cat though.  or  or beyond ...now thats up there.Do you know what was wrong with her that caused her to pass? Did a Vet give you any idea?Sorry I just get curious when I see people sharing their stories here.Im just wondering if she wasnt fed properly by her prior owner or she had gotten that thin on the streets. Also just for future reference when a cat is in that type of shape they should be treated by a Vet or sudden feeding after a prolonged period of starving can be fatal. Its the same thing that happened to concentration camp survivors in Germany at the end of WW II. They didnt realize that these prisoners who were nothing more than skin and bones couldnt suddenly be fed and that their nutrition had to be raised slowly or theyd die.I dont know what was wrong with this old girl. She may have had cancer. Who knows.

8442125,0,t3_4uy0q4,If you look for cat training devices there are some interesting things available.  There is an aerosol spray that is supposed to keep cats away from plants and it works but you might not want the scent on your textiles.There are plastic pads with spiky shaped pieces sticking up that might work too.  They look very uncomfortable for kitty feet.We have a little spray can called ssscat with a motion detector that sprays a little water and hisses at anyone who comes near.  It really works but I think that you have to buy refills.The thing we have that works the best and was cheap and easy is the sofa scram.  It takes a battery has an onoff switch and folds up when you dont need it.  Generally it is about as long as a standard sofa or a portion of the kitchen counter which is where we use it at night.The sofa scram emits a screech when pressure is applied that claims to be  decibels.  When we first got it our counter climber set it off several times and the poor dogs came running to see what the hell was going on in the kitchen.After just a few days the problem was solved and even though we set it out at night we never hear the beep.The only problem with the sofa scram is that our kitten is not heavy enough to set it off  but she is growing.PS Check out items in Drs Foster and Smith online  they have a selection.

8568587,0,t3_4x5icu,Is this your first cat?  People like to think of cats as being independent but kittens do require a fair amount of supervision or otherwise theyll get into trouble chewing on cords digging through trash clawing your furniture and various other things.  You can isolate them in a room temporarily while people are away but a kitten who spends a lot of time locked in a room alone will be very bored and may develop anxiety or other antisocial behaviors.  In my completely unprofessional opinion its best to get two kittens if there will be frequent periods of no people around so that they can play with each other or adopt an adult cat who has already been socialized and doesnt need constant supervision.With that out of the way taking a one or two week trip occasionally is fine as long as you can have somebody check on them once every day or two to feed them and change the litter box unless you want excrement all over the floor.  Some cats also do just fine going on trips as long as you get them used to car rides and visiting new places from an early age.,cats,d6cnjw2,3,t5_2qhta

Kittens can be jerks.With that said I had a kitten who liked to bite very hard and kept doing it well past his kitten phase.  What I eventually did with him was I bought some bitter apple spray usually sold as a deterrent for dogs chewing on things but cats also strongly dislike it sprayed that liberally on my hands and then baited him into biting me.

The entire point of a pet deposit is to pay for any damages the pet might cause after all.  Maybe theyll be reasonable about it.If they refuse your best option is probably to ask for your deposit back and look for a different apartment.  If they wont give you your deposit back point out that this term wasnt disclosed to you before you made your deposit and tell them that youre perfectly willing to take them to small claims court and sue them for the deposit the cost of the your time that theyve wasted and how much effort it will take you to find another apartment.  it also may be a good idea to read up on how small claims court works in your state,cats,d6j41ax,4,t5_2qhta

He was fixed way to young had fleas and wormswhich he gave to spitz and he was so so sick. He had a massive fever he was lethargic and wouldnt move much when he was really feeling it. Had his third eyelids way up cause he felt like crap. Yet even sick as he was every time we touched him he would make this cute little beeping noise and purr so loud you could hear it across the room. Honestly it was like he was saying Im sorry  Im sick but I really do love you!I was scared then because hes more mine and Spitz loves my wife more. I thought he was going to die his fever was so high. I had him at the vet all the time the first few weeks. We eventually got him an injection of subdermal fluid to cool him and I took him home and laid in bed with him while he shivered through it. He didnt like that cold stuff under his skin one bit.

I was awfully worried when you mentioned that you werent sure he could handle bathroom chores on his own.  We had a old Himalayan with the kitty equivalent of a slipped disk who exhibited similar symptoms.  She gradually completely lost the use of her back end.  She also had heart trouble and wasnt a surgical candidate although the condition could have been fixed surgically.  We were told she had a very poor chance of making it through the surgery so we didnt try it.  Im still not sure that was the right choice.  Maybe we should have risked surgery.  From the cats point of view there probably isnt much difference between passing on the operating table or being euthanized.  So anyway Im really hoping that your kitty pulls through.

8973219,0,t1_d7qfjjc,Dr. Piersons site looks at feline obesity as well. It can sometimes be from all the carbsgrains in kibble. It makes me kind of sad when I see people posting pictures of their seriously obese cats on Reddit and going look at my cute adorable fatty or similar... the cat is miserable and unhealthy NOT cute and it cant control its food or weight the way a human can. I wish I knew about this stuff years ago  I fed my dog and cat on kibble for  years because I thought that was the best for them. Then the dog got cancer and died and the cat got kidney failure and Im still feeling massive guilt. Im definitely no expert and I know I have to take everything on the internet with a grain of salt but Ive done some poking around and found some studies that show that dogs have been significantly altered during our domestication of them  their genes show that theyve been so significantly changed via domestication that they can now digest starches grains and carbs. Wolves cant of course! But weve changed dogs in a way that they now benefit more from a varied diet that does include some fruits veggies whole grains and other things rather than just a pure meat diet.But we havent managed to affect the same change in the domestic cat  theyre still obligate carnivores who cant digest starches and carbs. Yet pet food companies havent changed their formulations for cats... probably because grains are cheaper.The dog is ever eager to please even to the point of happily evolving its digestion to match ours while the stubborn independent cat refuses to be affected by domestication and maintains its carnivorous ways  My apologies for all the rambling  its am and also feline nutrition is an area of great interest to me ,cats,d7qg1az,1,t5_2qhta
8973300,0,t3_536s3f,Short answer no.Longer I had a look at some info on it... what are nutraceutical components? What does that even mean? I dont trust a company that makes up buzzwords to make their food sound better.The ingredients are also low quality all grains and mysterious meat meal and fillerChicken Meal Ground Yellow Corn Fish Meal Brewers Rice Corn Gluten Meal  thats THREE of the first FIVE ingredients that are grains... cats are obligate carnivores and cannot digest grain. They derive virtually zero nutritional value from grains.Ground corn is high in carbohydrates allergenic and difficult for dogs and cats to process. Brewers Rice is the same  a carbohydrate filler that is unnecessary. Cats dont eat rice. And Corn Gluten Meal is highly allergenic and causes gastrointestinal fermentation and other GI upsets.Long and short most kibble brands are full of carbohydrates which a cat cannot digest. A cat is a meateater an obligate carnivore. It cannot get much if any nutrition from grains fruits or vegetables.I really recommend going with a grainfree cannedwet food and NOT any kind of kibble. Kibble is harmful to cats provides no benefits and causes a cat to be in a constant state of dehydration. Im not being facetious  cats have low thirst drives as compared to another animal such as a dog. Cats descend from desert animals who are designed to get their moisture needs from their food meat. They do not have an instinct to drink much and they will NEVER drink enough to make up for the deficit if fed kibble. This can lead to kidney failure and urinary tract issues such as stones crystals blockages and infections.Kibble does NOT clean a cats teeth. Their teeth are designed to shear meat not chew dried pieces of kibble. Its like saying a person cleans their teeth by eating potato chips. Its just not true.Kibble also has a higher chance of carrying bacteria and toxins than canned food.  this site was written by a vet who has researched the canned vs. kibble scenario extensively. She has a whole section on how to transition a cat from kibble to canned food.I fed my cat kibble for  years because I didnt know any better. Then she developed kidney failure and the vet told me she had  months to live she had lost over  of her kidney function. I did my research and found studies on how terrible kibble is and other peoples positive experiences after switching to canned food.I switched my cat to a canned diet and then to a fullyraw diet and she is still alive six years later at the age of  still playful and happy with all her original teeth. The kidney failure will eventually kill her as I cannot reverse the damage that I did to her with kibble but keeping her on a moisturerich wet diet has let her have more time than anyone believed shed have.,cats,d7qgdyy,2,t5_2qhta

I assume you are not feeding milk or dairy and that upsets kittys. If his poos are solid but he poops out of the box. He might have bad memories of being sick of in pain.

I lived with one for years so I know what they look like in the flesh Im not just basing this off picturesI think people can get very confused about this because it seems like the average person thinks tabby is a breed but this cat does resemble a norwegian forest cat it has a bit of a broad nose and so on. Its not just the fluffiness or head M even if thats what most people are commenting on. And its Swedish so it makes perfect sense for it to have that kind of bloodPurebred cats arent special as you said and also they will father kittens with any cat if they can and youll likely not have any proof. Its easy to see persian or siamese ancestry in some moggies and as these are very commonly owned where I live and especially were very commonly owned before widespread neutering moggies will have that ancestry despite being unquestionably only moggiesThis moggy is definitely prettier in my opinion than those broad faced maine coons and norwegian forest cats!

9028141,0,t3_53x18r,Heres some food for thought. Fleas carry heartworms. Once infected they cant be cured and from what I hear that impacts the quality of life for your cat.Fleas carry other lovely parasites like tapeworm!! Not just for the cats in your care but for you! Granted you have to ingest the flea but those suckers can jump! Right into your mouth. While you sleep. Sleep on that.If you have an infestation the whole house and yard must me treated. Just bathing the animals isnt enough. Fleas can live in upholstery short term and even on humans for a while up to  hours I believe depositing eggs and having sips of blood along the way.The diatomaceous earth recommendation is a good one but a thorough cleaning is also necessary.,cats,d7x1gvy,1,t5_2qhta

I just started crying hysterically because I didnt go to school much and my teacher was calling me I was doing a school project with this one girl and she kept messaging me why I hadnt done anything and my friend was trying to get me to come to school.I was kind of scared to tell anyone about my situation because most people probably think its silly to be so sad about losing a cat or any pet.

After about a month of me showing it love and attention he turned the corner...I came home from work dead tired one day and fell asleep on the couch. I woke up to him sitting on my chest purring like crazy... From that point on he seriously was my best bud. He got me through such a terrible time in my life and I miss him all the time.It is truly amazing what an animal can do for you...at times I really had depression so bad that I really didnt want to be here but I always found myself thinking if I did Perry would probably be back with those assholes...

We had an appointment scheduled with his normal vet for a little later in the week as we just figured his insulin needed to be adjusted. Then Tuesday night he barely ate anything and went and slept in our closet. Around  just as we were getting into bed he let out a loud howl took three steps out of the closet and collapsed. We rushed him to the emergency animal hospital and they kept him overnight as his sugar was really low and his belly was distended. Ultrasound the next morning showed that he had numerous tumors all through his intestines and the largest of them had ruptured. There was nothing that could be done. He was so septic that they thought hed hang on lonn enough for us to get there but he probably didnt have much more time than that.

9360027,0,t3_58q5bi,There are plenty of cats that are friendly with dogs available at shelters. Check online at petfinder.com contact some rescues. And see what you can find. That said if you dont have luck or finding an adult already friendly with dogs kittens are usually very open to forming bonds with other animals. However solo kittens are a lot of work and spend pretty much all their waking moments playing and getting into trouble. I had to play with my kitten for  minutes x a day really hard to keep him sane and well behaved. Two kittens are far easier than one if you decide to go that route but many are raised in foster homes with dogs and already love them. See what you can find!,cats,d92g8wf,2,t5_2qhta

9373800,0,t3_58w8ju,Find a good vet and ask them for some material that could help you pamphlets etc.  Youll want to get the kitten checked out by the vet too.  Youll need to get it fixed because with either gender it prevents further health and behavioral problems and helps to keep the population from getting higher.  It will need regular shots and preventive care as well.Dont play with a cat with your hands.  Its really tempting but it teaches the cat that your hands are things to be played with and some cats have a hard time finding a boundary of how rough to play.  Ive had some pretty bad bites and scratches in the past from cats losing control while playing and I dont play with my current cats with my hands at all only with toys.Often if a cat is alone a lot it can get bored and lonely and start having some behavioral problems.  You might want to consider getting a second cat as a buddy for your cat.  You could talk to your vet about that.Dont physically punish a cat  meaning not to hitspankkick the cat because of behavior.  That pretty much just is transferring aggression into the cat.  It will make things worse.  Also cats are very different from dogs and arent trained the way dogs are.  You teach a cat what is acceptable.  Rewards go a lot further than punishment with cats.  Cats are stubborn and if it becomes a battle of wills it just sucks.  I would recommend watching My Cat from Hell if youre able to.  Its a tv show that features cat behaviorist Jackson Galaxy and he explains so much about the way cats think and behave and how to communicate with them.  He also has a couple of books out.One thing Ive found helpful is playing with my cats for about  minutes before feeding them.  It kind of gives them the thrill of the hunt and then they can enjoy a good meal and go to sleep happy. Also people often assign motives to cats as if they are human.  My cat was mad at me and peed outside the litter box.  Animals just simply dont think like that.  And there can be several reasons why a cat suddenly isnt using a litter box.  It could be a health problem another cat could have scared them while using the litter box and now they associate it with that sometimes if that cat experiences painful urination they associate that pain with the litter box and try to avoid it.  Also some litter can hurt a cats paws especially if declawed.  Please dont declaw its inhumane and is pretty much cutting off the ends of all their fingers.As far as cuddling you cant make a cat cuddle.  You have to let it come to you.  Be kind to it play with it with toys feed it the appropriate amount on time the vet could help with figuring that out and what works best for you and show it respect and it will likely reciprocate that kindness back.  If it lets you know it doesnt want to be held and you put it down its more likely to trust that you wont force it to be held.  And having a cat decide to come to you and cuddle on your lap feels like a real honor.  To me anyway. Sorry this is so long.  Im excited for you!  Thanks for taking care of this kitty.   Feel free to message me if you have any question or need to talk about your kitty.Edit Also if they scratch a piece of furniture I put a cardboard scratching postbedetc next to it so Im putting a yes next to a no for them.

9399123,0,t3_59c7zy,Drugs for fearful behaviors that could be used on an ongoing basis include fluoxetine paroxetine or clomipramine buspirone or other TCAs or SSRIs might be an alternative. A benzodiazepine such as alprazolam might be used on an asneeded basis for situational anxiety such as car rides. Because of the range of individual variability in behavioral effects and adverse effects trials with different benzodiazepines should be done in advance to determine which drug and dose achieves the desired effect and for how long. Caution is necessary particularly with the use of diazepam for any indication of anorexia or depression because rare cases of acute and potentially fatal hepatic dysfunction have been reported. In some situations a benzodiazepine such as clonazepam might be considered on an ongoing basis for a more immediate anxiety reduction and to enhance appetite for counterconditioning.,cats,d97ekxa,1,t5_2qhta

BUT as funny as that particular incident was it gets less and less funny when its an ongoing thing lol.I have definitely had my fair share of cats over the years and its always a toss up of what Ill end up with which is why I would like to give a purebread a go. I have also had  cat long haired siamese that was an asshole from day  hated everyone hated any and every dog hated all other cats and I also had a little orange tabby that was absolutely psychotic  aptly named tweak unfortunately I didnt get to see him as an adult because I lost him to coyotes. But the reason I shared about the  cats I did is because they were all so similar as kittens yet so very different as adults.Thats why I originally posted here I have plenty of experience aquireing purebread dogs but Im at a loss with cats its definitely proven to be quite a bit more difficult to find a reputable breeder that also has kittens available the time of year may play a factor into availability and Im noticing alot of them will not ship animals so if I do get one it may involve a road trip.

The torbie part comes in because of the tabby pattern. Thats just her coloration though as far as breed shes a DMH or DLH domestic medium hair or domestic long hair.

But most of all I still remember Shadow and all the great times we had. He was my best friend and now I love my furry companions x harder. Heres to Buu and Shadow cuddling sleeping and playing with pencils and strings for ever. RIP lt,cats,d9sw4bu,1,t5_2qhta

If the cat slips out you drop everything track it down and shove it back inside.If you have a regular door dasher you spend some time doing some training. I had a foster cat that was an indooroutdoor kitty that was adamant that he went outside. We set him up I waited outside with a garden hose and had someone open the front door. When he stuck his nose outside I soaked him. It only had to happen once before he became much more cautious about going outside.

Do not leave food or catnip as it can attract other catsanimals that will scare your cat off.You can also try to trap your cat using something that smells strongly of you as bait in the trap but you will need to make sure you get a cat safe trap and you will need to be very patient because that can take a long time. If you do this you can bait the trap with some smelly canned food or tuna but be prepared to potentially catch a lot of other catsanimals.Make sure you hang fliers and talk to people in the area so they know that is your cat. If they know you are trying to get him home some kind hearted people may be willing to help you out with bringing him home.,cats,daimplp,2,t5_2qhta

9909184,0,t3_5hcni0,Welcome to cats! They will quite often produce mysterious substances from their bodies that will baffle and frighten you! That looks like a hairball otherwise known as a fur cigar. I recommend starting a grooming routine now while your kitten is young so it gets used to being brushedcombed. Do it once every other day or so if its a shorthair daily if shes a medium or longhair. This will just help remove some of the loose fur from her coat so she wont lick it up and carry it around in her stomach until its time to barf out the next hair loogie.Cats will often nom on grass when they have digestive problems as they cannot digest the grass at all cats are obligate carnivores meaning they cannot properly digest anything other than meat. The grass helps them vomit up whatever might be bothering them. I think in your little girls case she had a hairball that she couldnt hork up on her own so she ate some grass. You can keep a small patchbox of cat grass around for her to snack on  it wont harm her. You can find preplanted cat grass in pet stores and sometimes even in regular supermarkets in the pet supplies aisle. Note that I dont mean catnip  cat grass is usually oat sprouts or some other kind of sprouted plant that is safe for cats to consume. ,cats,daz6ut6,5,t5_2qhta

10106044,0,t3_5kjo4t,Try a product called Feliway. Its a synthetic pheromone designed to mimic cat face pheromonesmom cat pheromones. You plug in the diffuser and the Feliway will spread through the room. Its odorless and harmless to humans. Some people have reported amazing successes with it  curbing negative behaviors such as aggression and scratching but it also helps with anxiety. You can put several diffusers around the house  I have one in the garage for my elderly cat who has several chronic health problems  she doesnt have any bad behaviors but it helps her stay calm on her bad days when she isnt feeling so great. I also advocate using fear plus a mild physical punishment to curb bad behaviors  it worked wonders with my cat but many people are horrified at the thought of using physical punishment. However cats are animals and they dont speak nor understand language nor can they rationalize things like humans do. What does mom cat do if her babies bite too hard or do something else that displeases her? She gives them a swat with her paw. She doesnt take away their toys or give them a timeout.When Maisy engages in bad behavior such as scratching furniture slam your hands HARD onto whatever is nearby  floor wall countertop  and yell NO in a deep loud voice. Basically youre trying to make as much noise as you can at once to scare the crap out of Maisy. Cats hate being startled. You can do the same thing for the yowling at night  itll disturb your sleep to do the fearpunishment but shes disturbing your sleep anyway!You can also add a very light physical punishment to the fearpunishment  tap her on the top of the head with a finger along with a loud NO. Youre not hitting just tapping firmly  imagine that youre trying to get someones attention with a tap on their arm. Again most people will condemn physically punishing a pet but animals understand physical gestures not words. I know I said use the word NO when yelling  you can use any other word NO is just conveniently easy to bellow.My own cat was like Maisy in terms of standoffishness  I could not pet her nor approach her for most of her life. She was an outdoors cat though and was super skittish. Her only friend in life was my German Shepherd  they were inseparable. So my cat more or less didnt need me for social interactionaffection. When my dog died in  I suddenly had a superaffectionate clingy senior cat who wanted to cuddle lay on my legs and generally be within three microns of me at all times. Six years later my cat is  and is still supercuddly. She doesnt want to live in the house but she happily comes indoors whenever I let her and will mash herself into whatever body part of mine is closest to her. Im not saying Maisy will be standoffish forever but she may be basically getting all her social and physical interaction needs filled by Eva. You can try to slowly bribe Maisy to enjoy translation tolerate being petted and cuddled by forcing her to endure several seconds of scritches or pettings and then giving her a small treat. Keep increasing the length of time of the physical interaction and always finish with a treat. Shell quickly learn that being pettedscritched is actually kind of nice and its always a positive experience delicious treats!As for urinating everywhere  get her to a vet for a checkup. MOST inappropriate elimination behaviors have underlying medical problems. ,cats,dbotutr,3,t5_2qhta

10196679,0,t3_5lzlk3,How small is the kitten? Have you taken it to see a vet yet? They can usually tell the age. It sounds like the kitten is frightened and very scared and needs some time in a calm environment to get acquainted. I know nothing about your son but is he old enough and mature enough to not hurt or scare the cat even more? Some kids think they are helping by crowding the kitten chasing it smothering it etc. that they may be doing more harm than they realize. Shit in your sons room for a few days may have not been the best option in case he tried to force her to cuddle and possibly scared her more. Id give the cat a small safe quiet room to itself and maybe just you or other adults have access to for a few days to see if the kitten calms down. Its probably just very frightened. A lot of cats will warm up over time and some need different approaches to becoming members of the family. good luck!,cats,dbzulun,1,t5_2qhta

10199116,0,t1_dc01sz8,The bacteria is anaerobic and likes anaerobic environments.  Rusty metal tends to be found in reducing environments and a pile of manure is a reducing environment.gt Tetanus is caused by the tetanus bacterium Clostridium tetani. Tetanus is often associated with rust especially rusty nails. Although rust itself does not cause tetanus objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors or in places that harbour anaerobic bacteria. Additionally the rough surface of rusty metal provides a prime habitat for C. tetani endospores to reside in due to its high surface area while a nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospores deep within the body at the site of the wound.gt An endospore is a nonmetabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment. Because C. tetani is an anaerobic bacterium it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack oxygen. Hence stepping on a nail rusty or not may result in a tetanus infection as the lowoxygen anaerobic environment is caused by the oxidization of the same object that causes a puncture wound delivering endospores to a suitable environment for growth.,cats,dc04kld,8,t5_2qhta

10352146,0,t3_5o8kwx,High protein diets can be high in phosphorous which can be taxing to kitty kidneys especially if theyre already compromised. Often times cats that have been kept on a dry kibble diet for most of their life already have damaged many of their nephrons.  Raw diets are actually not high protein diets if you sit down and work out the grams of fat vs carbs vs protein. They are high in moisture and moderate in protein and low in carbohydrates. Fat will vary depending on what youre feeding.,cats,dchh5hd,2,t5_2qhta

10397830,0,t1_dcmmybl,Yeah when my cats ate together they pretty much left each other alone. They were both fed in a different room from the dogs because the dogs will just inhale any food but they usually drank all from the same dish. Its so funny to see the dogs whimp out when the cat just walks in front of their little watering hole line though. They give me that same look Why are you letting this happen? when the cat goes on the table. Especially since my one dog used to go on the table and hed get yelled at. Im sure he is confused as to why this very tiny and odd dog gets to do all of the things I like to imagine that the dogs thing the cat is just a very tiny weird looking dog and that the cat thinks the dogs are just larger and weird looking cats. ,cats,dcmns7r,2,t5_2qhta

Then he had a friend couple go on vacation for a month and he housecat sat?while they were gone. That sealed the deal.

10781646,0,t1_dds0nvs,Neo was originally a feral outside cat.  I was completely unable to keep him inside.  He was an escape artist. So I just gave up and gave him a cat door to make it as safe as I could.Recently my state released some cougars into the woods. Ive lost  cats at night in the last  years or so.  I have one cat left and hes only allowed outside in the daytime.We think Neo died saving that last kitten.  Kitten came barrelling in through the cat door with all his fur puffed out.  There were terrible sounds coming from outside from what I understand.  We never saw Neo after that So the night time took away my Neo.

10859047,0,t1_ddzxqok,I mention the pain of brushing out mats because with small and spaced out mats you can actually brush them out depending on the severity and how the cat takes it. Cat hair is surprisingly forgiving with small mats so that cats can simply pull them out in the wild youll often see this with bobcats during the winter where theyll pull snow and matting from between the pads of their toes.This is not a comfortable process and often leaves people shocked as their cats will end up looking bald or thin haired around where these mats come out. This is because matting forms when dirt dander and dead hair wrap into a hard knot around live and healthy hair. As a result the live hair will often get pulled on and pulled out with the mat. Cats hair breaks away from the skin fairly easily to allow little mats to be addressed before they become a huge issue. Youll also notice this happens with severe matting after a shave in areas where the mats were very tight youll see very thin hair due to the tightness and heaviness of the mats pulling out healthy hair before it was shaved away.I absolutely agree with you that in the case of severe matting the only option is to shave. You cant just rip out huge swatches of a cats coat. And anyone that owns a cat out there please do not EVER cut your cats mats with scissors. Matting pulls on hair and skin and it can easily become difficult to tell the difference between skin and mat. Using scissors even carefully can result in a not so fun trip to the vet when you cut a chunk of your cats skin off. If youre an owner of one of those cottony fluffy monsters that seems to always mat up I highly recommend in investing in a clipper with tight teeth and some combs like this Theyre well worth the money.,cats,de018oq,1,t5_2qhta

10956484,0,t3_5wgnnp,Youre not overreacting and it sounds like youve got a bored cat.They will do these things when they want attention. even if youre yelling and chasing them away youre paying attention to them. thats why they do it.My recommendation you wont like... get another cat the same age I have fosterd MANY litters of kittens and I always try to push people to take two. the difference in cost is negligable but giving them someone to play with while theyre young is just amazinglly good. it also will help keep him from getting bored and bothering you.As for the feeding thats a tough one and Im in the same boat. I have a cat that has diabetes and epilepsy I have to give him a shot and a pill every  hours. To give him th shot he MUST eat before its insulin. So i have to give him something he loves.I give him a half a tea spoon of tuna in water. just a little bit because the mercury isnt good for them. I also free feed him AND give him wet food because even the very expensive dry food I give him because hes diabetic the food costs me about  for a  pound bag versus  at walmart for meow mix. Even cheapo Fancy Feast classic is better for themNow doing all that? he begs for tuna every half hour or so and every single time I go into the kitchen. how do I know thats what hes doing? he stares at the fridge and screams.I dont know how youre ever going to stop that part. but I disagree that free feeding is bad. i have  cats. only the diabetic is fat insulin does that and i have to make sure he eats so i give him lots of choices the other two are perfectly fine and have food available  the expensive dry food.it just depends on the cat. however based on your description I think thats why the vet has you do timed feedings. because some cats just dont lose that instinct of inhaling food they do this because in the wild eating is a vulnerable time and they scarf things down.I can tell you one thing as he gets older he will slowly calm down and become better behaved. but you mention walking away when you pet him? I have found through literally having hundreds of cats in my home over the years they are all different. I have one sweet timid cat that will walk over to me purr and meow rubbing all over my legs and arching her back. When i pet her she has to sniff my hand for at least a minute before i can pet and even then im only allowed to softly brush the side of her face. she walks away as soon as I start then comes back for another drive by.They have unique behavior and i hate this. that cat i just described is beautiful and have super soft fur. i want so badly to cuddle her but she just doesnt like it. Ive learned to appreciate what she does like.One trick put your hand down then he comes by purring and see how he rubs your hand. Thats where he wants you to pet him Finally i visit this feline diabetes forum. Now you dont have a diabetic cat but these guys know about everything possible with cats and nutrition. They can help and youd be surprised how different their advice can be than a vet. Ive found vets themselves will vary greatly in their nutritional advice.try that for all sorts of behavior. its mainly for diabetics but tell him a member with a diabetic cat sent you and they will surely help,cats,dea30dm,2,t5_2qhta

What if OP has a strange obsession with the cat that causes his life to be very unhealthy? What if the OP doesnt take care of the cat as well as he should? I dont know. You dont know. There are reasons someone would ask for a cat to be transferred somewhere else that isnt only manipulation.

11001286,0,t1_deev14i,Sorry I didnt phrase my litter box sentence very well. We have two boxes but one of them he wont use anymore. He stopped using it ever since the surgery. Do you have any tips for how to get a cat back into using a box? The one he does like has special litter in it that is very expensive. We were in the process of phasing it out because we were spending so much on litter and wanted to go back to the regular clay. I wouldnt mind getting a third one but Id like it to be the clay kind the box he isnt using instead of getting a second expensive one! Both litter boxes are automatic which I think has helped with having two cats and two boxes. ,cats,deeyoz2,1,t5_2qhta

11207819,0,t3_5zzfkk,Have you taken them to the vet to determine why they might be getting urinary tract problems? My experience is that these cats are typically on dry kibble and are chronically dehydrated which leads to kidney problems over the long term. Simply switching cats to wet food or adding water to their dry food either solves the problem completely or greatly reduces occurrence of infections. If you absolutely must feed kibble there are urinary formulations out there. Hills Science makes one that I see recommended frequently. In no case would I recommend you self treat with alternative therapies not extensively scientifically researched.,cats,df2e68g,2,t5_2qhta

11213719,0,t3_5zx9mr,I love this!  This is exactly how we came to adopt our Bud.  He showed up at our apartment one night  years ago when we went out to walk our dog.  He was sick and he was so desperate for help that he practically dragged himself past me and Katie our collie to get by my husband.  It smelled like something was dead in the field next to the apartment and it turned out he had an abcess that had ruptured and that was the source of the odor.  I was a vet tech and I have two years of actual veterinary school so I cleaned him up and put him on antibiotics.  He healed beautifully but it would break my heart when we would go inside for the night and Bud would be sitting looking longingly into the apartment.  We decided to have him tested for FeLV and FIV and we had him neutered and Bud got his wish.  For the last   years he has been our very handsome Siamese boy that we love to death.  He instantly got along with our other cats right from the start.  He turned into quite the house cat.  ,cats,df328nk,2,t5_2qhta

11276241,0,t1_df9rxhx,Thats definitely not something Ive observed or ever heard of. uscenemissing is correct in saying that they are much more likely to be male though I cant think of any other instance where fur colour in cats leads to a generalisation of a cats behaviour. From my own experience a cats behaviour is very heavily dictated by their upbringing. Ive trapped and raised something like  kittens over the past few years. If I can get them at  weeks of age they always seem to turn out very friendly and affectionate house cats.  weeks or more and they become harder to tame. They get there eventually but they almost always grow up to me far more timid and aloof.The two gingers at the front of the pile are brothers trapped at the same time and raised the same way though they still have very different personalities. The big one is a friendly clumsy doofus who likes to stomp all over you in the mornings. The smaller one gets a bit slappy when new cats come into the house but theyre both still very affectionate cats ,cats,dfa592f,21,t5_2qhta

11286141,0,t1_dfb92uk,Were actually going to check out a shelter this weekend this is what he did when he got his cat some  years ago. Its actually a bit complicated  not too long after we put my cat down he was  and both of our cats had been sick in the end we adopted a brother and sister that were about  months old. It turned out they were sick and infected with a parasite that is commonly found in livestock and has no real cure. Many cats can live with it and have no problems but the male cat was effectively oozing mucus from his butt all over our house. We dont live somewhere that can easily quarantine a cat and had JUST gone through something like this with both of our older cats. It was emotionally exhausting never mind gross to have to constantly clean up so we made the heartbreaking decision to take them back to the foster organization I very well think the male will end up being put down as there isnt much that can be done for him at this point. That was about a month ago so he has been a bit scarred by the whole experience and is worried about getting relatively healthy cats. Which I totally understand but Im so sad without any animals in the house after having had them for  years. Well get there eventually but thanks for sharing I also love the ittybittykittycommittee sadly on the wrong coast!.,cats,dfb9n8g,14,t5_2qhta

11399277,0,t3_62mqqk,I live in San Francisco and I walk my cat in the city. The sidewalks are disgusting so I only bring him to parks or beaches.In my opinion a cat with a good personality for leash training is one who doesnt bolt at any little thing. It is best that if the cat is scared he runs to you instead of runs away from you.The leash I use is Come With Me Kitty but it is easy to get out of if he tried. However my cat never minds the leash so hes never tried. There was one instance where I tied his leash to a chair in an enclosed courtyard and he flipped out of the harness due to the tension. When he got out he just sat there. When Im carrying him through a noisy or busy place he digs his head into my chest instead of bolting away. I have another cat that bolts at everything even if I just walk towards him. I dont want that cat out much and usually i keep him in the carrier.We can chat over PM more.

She immediately took to me. This was hilarious because my wife is the cat person and Id never had a pet before. She started peeing in our bed. However she only did it on my wifes side of the bed and only when I left the house and the rest of my family didnt. She was jealous maybe scared trying to supplant my wife we think. We underwent a fairly intense couple weeks of exposing her to affection from all family members including threeway cuddles tee hee between me my wife and her. We also once we figured out the trigger were there to grab her once Id left the house and deposit her in the litterbox. Shes still my cat and if were being honest she probably thinks that she and I are mates and my wife is the concubine or something but its an easy truce.

11686490,0,t1_dgjjloa,I follow the askVet subreddit and try to find official articles from the government vet schools or vet hospitals to read. Basically anything ending in .gov or .edu. If its a source with .com or .org BE SKEPTICAL! The consensus Im seeing is that there isnt any explicit warning against dry food and theres even an article saying dry food causing obesity is not proven link here Dry foods and risk of disease in cats However many cats dont drink enough water. This is the main reason I feed wet food. I even add water to the wet food so they drink more I have a water fountain but one cat never uses it....Expensive doesnt mean better! Theres been a lot of recalls with blue buffalo. Try Royal Canin Slices in Gravy texture. My cat who is a super picky eater LOVES it. Im only found  brands he will eat and Ive tried literally all the brands available around me I went to petco and got several cans of each brandline. He licks the bowl clean afterwards.According to vets theres nothing bad about byproducts or fillers. Heres some links Ive collectedFDA warning against raw food And info on grainsgt Contrary to popular belief grainfree diets do not offer health benefits over a diet that contains grains and each diet should be assessed based on its overall nutrient profile rather than individual ingredients.Digestion of grains is no different from digestion of other carbohydrate sources that have similar nutrient profiles. Many consumers have been led to believe that dogs and cats lack the enzymes or capacity needed to digest grains as compared to potatoes peas apples and other sources of carbohydrates used in grainfree diets. The truth is that the starch the main carbohydrate in appropriately prepared grains is highly digestible usually  or greater for both dogs and cats.gtIn recent years corn has been described as a low quality filler in pet foods and implicated as the culprit in pets with food allergies typically by competitor food companies. In reality corn provides a nutritious affordable source of carbohydrate for energy essential amino and fatty acids for healthy skin coat and immune system function and a variety of other nutrients. These nutrients are released during the manufacturing process and are easily absorbed and utilized when included in complete diets.By Productsgt Byproducts are an excellent source of protein and other nutrients. A byproduct is any ingredient that is produced or left over when some other product or ingredient is made broth and gelatin are examples of meat byproducts in human foods. Byproducts in pet foods that meet Association of American Feed Control Officials AAFCO guidelines come from clean animal parts other than meat such as liver kidneys and other organs. Purina purchases all byproducts from USDAinspected plants. They must meet stringent criteria for nutrient content production and quality assurance. Some askVet threadsAskVets side bargt We usually recommend anything that has been tested in controlled trials on real dogs under the supervision of veterinary nutritionists. That includes anything manufactured by Purina Eukanuba Hills Iams and Royal Canin. The idea that the list of ingredients has any bearing on a foods nutritional qualities is hogwash plain and simple. Consult our FAQ for a list of reliable resources.This is a blog so take warning but still interesting to read his thoughts as it starkly contrasts the many popular cat food blogs out there ,cats,dgkoj6m,4,t5_2qhta

11770029,0,t3_67w8zx,I gotcha fam kitty IT support here.Your cat attempted to run flex.exe and encountered an unknown error.  What you need to do is gently grasp the tail and carefully swoosh it in a counterclockwise direction.  This reboots the cat.There is a  chance this will solve your problem and a  chance your hand will be bitten.,cats,dgu5wry,10,t5_2qhta

11784130,0,t1_dgvqp67,Lightly I think. My rule has always been that we dont play with hands so I pull back whenever my cat tries it. Do you know if your cat had siblings?  A cat who had other kittens to play with should know how to avoid doing any serious damage. Everything you describe sounds like hes trying to play with you like hed play with another cat. Making pain noises especially high pitched ones will get him to back off,cats,dgvrpr7,1,t5_2qhta
