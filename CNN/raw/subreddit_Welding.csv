1344545,0,t3_29h9d7,Im in the same boat buddy. You are asking a great question that after about two weeks Im barely discovering the answer to and even now theres probably an even better way!. If youre serious youre going to need training. For me I recently reserved a place in a beginning stick welding class at a local JC. The instructors are professionals so Im going to definitely ask about the proper and most efficient trajectory for a new welder assuming the ultimate goal would be to gain a foothold in the career which for me it is. Another thing you a can do is solicit a callemail from your local UA which are the unions responsible for welders. Not all of them have this super awesome function but I found one that lets you input your information and they contact you with more details. IMO its hard enough as it is. They should all be doing this but yeah.In the meantime you should learn as much as you can. Theres seriously not that much to know. And make sure you understand the dangerous and pay considerable attention to safety precautions and procedures. I wish you the best.,Welding,cikvl2k,2,t5_2serw

1387548,0,t3_29zgqw,I am from austriavienna and I started to learn welding when I was  years old. That was a hrs course and I got out of it with  or  certificates but with no doctrine. Over a year I seeked for work when I finally was able to work as a welders helper. From there on it went good last job I did was quality check for welding beads. Thing is though I never felt very much connected to the people around me. Most of them just wanted to curse their women and the work and pray for weekend. I feel germans apart from the different form of becoming a welder take their work more seriously and have way more people that really think when working and in spare time too. Also because of the fact that austrians dont really speak german and most of the times very bad english at least in welders circles I would suggest even more that you learn in germany or start working there. Probably better when you can deliver some basic skills when applying. From that one year almost only german companies would at least claim to give beginners a job. One last thing as tatpig pointed out if you have the skills you can just go to a certificate institution and lay your beads according to your needs.,Welding,ciq7lw8,2,t5_2serw

Just gotta build a box basically to hold all your coals all easy angles and basic fillet welds. Then make some tabs to hold the grates. In the middle make a frame from some angle make and cover it with expanded metal mesh for the veggie cooker shelf part.

This was my fourth die change that day and I was getting frustrated. The help I had didnt really know what he was doing and I was too flustered to hold his hand through another die change. Fuck it Ill do it myself I said. So with the crane remote in one hand and the sketchy sling supporting the due in another Im trying to push the new die in. It wont go. Up down up down I try to get our clunky old sky crane to lift it in just the right spot. Well I got my directions mixed up. Instead of putting the due down I was pulling it up against the break press. The sling gives up first with a loud pop.The die drops.The sky crane bounces up and down left to right angrily. And Im just standing there trying to figure out what just happened. Luckily the die was in enough to catch on the lowered top of the break. And the sling didnt hit me. Nor did the sketchy crane cables break. ,Welding,clvmtzb,4,t5_2serw

The silver rule is make a note of the answers so you dont have to ask the same questions again.Most shops are safety first so dont compromise that.  Dont assume your machine is setup perfectly each shift check the ground connection gas hose feeder gun etc.  If the shop uses more than one wire double check that as well. Ask to see the WPS as well as their standard shop practices.  Try to make welds by the book as far as size profile and general appearance. If your beads are not laying down like they should ASK someone to look them over the solution might me something as simple as a slight change in gun angle.

We only had  hour classes once a week with a variety of exercises and tests to get through during the semester so after a few classes of trying to get the three root thing to work I just gave up and went back to two. Then when it came time to bend a piece for marks I aced the test the whole plate welded up real nice and my roots both went inbent perfect. At the time I just didnt have enough experience to put in nice small stringers for a three root.And yeah weaving can either go awesome or its just an undercut shitshow lol. The last vert practice plate I did I figured Id try stringers all the way out and being completely honest I had a why the hell havent I always done this?? moment.

Make sure that your starts specifically arent held too long to stabilize the arc or if you have to long arc to heat up the tie in area because if you start pushing metal in while the arc is stabilizing youll end up with a bump on the back from pausing before you started to move.Aside from that it looks pretty good you can try different heat ranges and fitup too.

5351342,0,t1_cvuwlqq,Pipeline work is going strong in Canada at the moment.  Union Gas TCPL and Enbridge have literally billions in work over the next several years. There is a great deal of public outcry over new pipeline approvals but I feel like its mostly media trying to sell the story to the uninformed combined with some hardcore greenpeace activism.  If you look at current projects youd wonder why everyone is always talking about Northern Gateway or Keystone.  Other sectors are in full swing as well.  Power plants are still being built.  Buildings are still going up.  There is welding work out there even in the darkest of times.  Perhaps it isnt in Alberta but for decades Canadians from other parts of the country have migrated to the middle of the country for welding work.I dont know why you invoke Canadian partisan politics given the actual reasons for the oil price drops but its clear how you vote. Do you honestly believe that youve been having a hard time staying employed because of your government?  Our government has no part in the oil price dropping.  No matter how antioil the NDP may be when push comes to shove people need it to exist so they can continue to live the lives theyre accustomed to.  You better believe the general public will revolt if you take away just one of their screens or their ability to affordably drive or god forbid any consumer product containing plastic. If they push too hard youll have new government sooner rather than later.As a Canadian I expect my government to get more for our natural resources that are in demand not less.  If the price of oil was over  a barrel every single Alberta oil patch company could afford to fork over more and they would.  Given the current pricing those royalty increases wont solve deficit issues anyway but laying the ground work for an inevitable rebound can happen now.   When the prices rebound and mark my words theyll rebound money from increased royalties will pay for more healthcare schools and infrastructure..etc etc.  These multinational corporations are seriously massive.  While theyre shelving some projects theyre certainly not down and out.  As long as it is profitable for them to dig up the tar sands theyll be there digging even if it means paying more in royalties and corporate taxes.  For now what makes to them financially translates directly into cutting back a great deal of industry jobs.  Im not saying this doesnt suck for those of us who are affected.  It definitely does.Lastly these big companies think much further ahead than the current political climate.  They look at global demand a growing global population and invest in infrastructure to make their shareholders money  to  years down the road.  While they will never want to pay more but so long as they profit theyll continue to pay if only out of fear of losing market share to their competitors.  The trick will be extracting maximum value for the Canadian public and that value simply must be open to review.,Welding,cvvozoe,2,t5_2serw

5685648,0,t1_cx1g739,Aircraft guy here Im sure Ive knocked down tens of thousands of ac rivets over the years. Heres a fun fact we can go down a whole row of rivets without talking to each other although I might be outside the fuselage with the rivet gun and my partner inside the ac and we cant see one another. We can communicate verbally if we need to we wear a headset and a throat microphone which is a velcro strap with two lozenge mics which sit over your larynx pointing inwards so they only pick up what were saying and not the noise of the rivet gun. Like this except us aircraft guys dont look derpy like this dude. It goes like this I put the snap of my rivet gun on the rivet and wait. Partner inside puts his bucking bar on the rivet tail and pushes towards me lifting the rivet slightly out of the hole I push back harder than him to seat the rivet head and squeeze off a burst how much depends on rivet material type diam and length and comes with experience. If he wants another short light burst he taps the rivet tail lightly once with the buck which I can feel through the gun. A heavy single tap means he wants another heavy burst. When its a good one he taps twice which means thats a good one next rivet. A good team can go down a whole length of stringer without exchanging a word. We would only use verbal comms to change position or to drill out a rivet if the head or tail got chopped.

To me its not just kinda green its really green even moreso than the Speedglas.  In my experience Miller hoods are also not nearly as durable andor tolerant of abuse as the ms. My x has survived falls and frontal impacts that would have definitely killed an Elite. If I only had m and Miller to choose from Id buy another Speedglas over an Elite. Im still waiting for Lincolns new version of the  with the C filter to become available before I spend  though. It looks like something I would like Problem is right now the only hood with the new lens that my LWS can actually order is the stupid Chip Foose edition instead of plain black because I guess Lincoln wants to sell off most of the older version  stock first. I refuse to pay extra for graphics especially graphics that are free advertising for someone elses business.The JacksonBaldor hood is also known for exceptional colorclarity and being another popular pick with the please anything but green crowd. Only bummers are  It only has two sensors and  very few welding supplies seem to keep cover lenses for it in stock. Edit to add The gold standard I compare my lenses to is an Aulektro shade .

6378557,0,t1_czemtp9,gt Whats your take on the quality of osu gradsSo OSU is a good program if you want to do analysis and research and one of the only programs thats strongly aligned if you want to go on for a masters or PhD in the subject.The problem is its very light on practical and handson knowledge doesnt give a strong foundation in actual welding troubleshooting welding equipment optimizing weld parameters or talking the talk of welders.  Its really a material sciencemechanical engineering degree thats  focused on welding.Now the problem is that in my experience the vast vast majority of welding engineering jobs especially those at the BA level is that they fall into the more handson category.  Most places want the guy who can come in trouble shoot the robots optimize the parameters develop review and tackle WPS and CWI type problems etc. Most arent looking for hardcore analysis of weld strength and having done that work welding is notoriously an extremely hard problem to solve analytically so its best to tackle it experimentally.So OSU makes good graduates for academiabut they tend not to fit the majority of most job demands out of the gate and they tend to lack that strong handson skill base unless they had prior experience in that field.  They are the ones welders sneer at when they are struggling to fix a bird nested MIG machine.As you can tell I could talk about this forever I think the problem is schools like PCT and Ferris state put out better candidates for the jobs BUT since we are engineering technology degrees we have to work out of the hump that we are not real engineers or just glorified technicians. Doesnt help that Ohio state is technically the only welding engineering degree in the country by ABET definition and that the ABET definition and requirements do not fit well with what industry wants from a  welding engineer.  Personally both career wise and personality wise I am very glad  I went to PCT it has carried me very far.

6453712,0,t3_441wfw,First priority when searching for a school should be the amount of shop hours. A  month course that focuses on actual practice is far more valuable than a year course that is mostly classroom oriented. Being knowledgable about welding on paper is not as valuable as being able to produce quality welds at least when it comes to entrylevel. Second thing you need to look out for is if the school teaches to AWSASME specifications andor offers the opportunity to take real certification tests. AWS and ASME are nationally recognized standards and having a certification under them will give your son a leg up. Pretty much everybody teaches blueprints and welding symbols but not everyone teaches fabrication. That means using a tape measure a square basic tools layout fitting etc... Again this is a matter of classroom vs. shop. I did not go to the Hobart school but have heard good things about them. Definitely visit your local options first. Often times you can get a free trial day or two. The demand and pay in this field depends largely on the location and industry. Good luck I hope this helps.,Welding,czmute7,5,t5_2serw

In all honesty if you cant set up a welder you shouldnt be welding.There are very specialized processes that youll never see in a home shop that are technically capable of adjusting themselves but not in the way you mean.If you cant set up a welder you have no business welding on vehicle frames and if youre just doing body panel work then FCAW is a shitty choice.,Welding,d02r14d,4,t5_2serw

The BMW is a full rustbucket restoration street car and the A has been ridden hard and put up wet for  years and needs a LOT of work. The pricepoint of that Multimatic is great even with the TIG package. What Im worried about is switching between the two. How involved is it? If it is essentially as fasteasy as if my two machines were stacked on top of each other it could be worth it. I dont really care about down time. I drive a desk amp keyboard for a living. This is purely a hobby. Even if Im at an event someone else always has something I can borrow in a pinch. This is therapy and fun not a paycheck. I think the switching time is what would make up my mind. If its involved Ill keep both machines however if I can run two gas setups and simply flip a switch and change easily between the two Id probably consolidate down to one machine. ,Welding,d09f8lq,1,t5_2serw

6899269,0,t1_d0y6od3,Texas weave is just a slang term so it depends on whos slang definition you choose to go by. Going by what the old farts have taught me using old school terminology to me personally a true Texas weave is more of a stacked diagonal stringers or herringbone pattern. It looks pretty cool and its definitely not common to come across even less common outside the oilfields. I havent seen one in years and if you do see an old style Texas weave in the wild its probably going to be on some pipe at least  years old because I dont think code even allows it anymore. Old Farts I know would call weld OPs pic a lace weave.In the last  years welder slang terminology has changed a bit. Now most people will just call any bigwide weave a Texas weave because yknow  everything is big in Texas.I made my first beads in the late s and a lot of things have changed since then. Now if somebody comes up with a new slang term it seems like everyone on the planet is using it a few weeks later because of the internet. Terms evolve more quickly now.Case in point is what is a Lincoln Tombstone? I only consider the old Idealarcs to be tombstones because they are shaped exactly like an old west style tombstone youd see in a Cowboy movie  the nickname fits. Now a lot of the younger guys will refer to AC s as tombstones even though they really arent An Old Fart will call an AC  a Buzzbox. So whats the point of me typing out this long winded explanation?  There are no formal definitions for slang terms.   Slang definitions change over time and it doesnt take as many years as most people would guess.

Whip and pause at a steady rate and remember that even while whipping keep the arc length the same. The number of times you whip and pause per second isnt a big deal just as long  as your overall travel speed is ok. One thing that helps with the sticking issue is to strike an arc on your welding table for about a half second to get the rod hot and to burn off that top piece of flux. That will actually allow an arc to start without the rod directly touching the metal which will keep you from sticking.  is my favorite rod so if you have any questions Im happy to help.

It is less work to set up with  rods you can burn in small to medium sized welds in one pass more comfortably and stick welding is a lot more versatile on site. Its a lot easier to change rod types than wire spools.

8087089,0,t1_d4okmr1,Edit misread and thought you said stainless steel.  everything still applies but you can get a little further travel with carbon steel.  With small stainless its important to have good gas coverage.  If you dont have a large diameter cup  or bigger i use a  you can only travel about half a cup diameter at a time. You also need to be purging.You can put in a little more heat than you expect to ensure you have full penetrating you just have to give it a little longer time between restarting the arc for the metal cool.  When i do material that size i run about  amps.Another thing youre going to have to watch for is grinding your stops.  When you are doing stainless and you have to break the arc without a foot pedal you have to do so in a way that ensures the puddle is fully shielded.  This is easier on heavy materials because you can long arc. Then once its solidified break.  But on thin stainless you wont really have that option as long arcing will put a ton of heat in the tubing.  If you just pop off you will leave a contaminated spot that will need to be ground completely out before restarting.  Couple this with the fact that you can only run about mm of weld at a time is going to make this a very very frustrating task.How can your machine do amperage control without a foot pedal?  I am pretty sure crater control only works in smaw mode. What machine are you using?Im pretty confident you are using inadequate equipment for your task and are giving yourself a severe handicap. You really need to be using a foot pedal for this job even if its just for stopping the arc and ensuring shielding gas coverage.,Welding,d4p29c4,1,t5_2serw

8719895,0,t1_d6v8ymb,TLDR Their main purpose is earning money for the franchise stores that sell them. begin rantTheyre expensive and dangerous toys.    The logic being that an average layperson isnt really willing to invest the  time and difficulty required to learn to weld passably and thereby know the difference. The machine is likely to just get retired to gathering dust after a couple of uses either way. So it doesnt matter how well it functions. Buyers arent going to care enough to want their money back. Caveat emptor etc.The Chinese companies who make them reason correctly that what total noobs are looking for is a does it make sparks and deposit metal globs? b can I take it home and plug it in to the wall without thinking about it? c is it cheap as possible?Im not saying you absolutely cant use them to make a passable weld at least the ones that are slightly a step up from the bottom line models.However you kind of need to be a professional welder with a couple years under your belt to do it.RantConversely professional grade machines  or  V are the easiest to learn on particularly MIG welders.For this reason the usual advice if you want start welding is to save money and invest in a welding class a a local tech college or trade school in your area. They have most of the nice professional tools and supplies youd want.,Welding,d6vmlam,1,t5_2serw

9196199,0,t1_d8hifac,Wow! That is some seriously impressive work.Sure so I can explain. Currently all our power reactors are PWRs and BWRs pressurized and boiling water reactors.  The fuel assemblies that sit in the core are made of two main parts the nuclear fuel and the fuel cladding.  The fuel is uranium oxide unless they throw in some plutonium sometimes in the form of small pellets. But you cant just throw in a bunch UO pellets so they are stacked in these fuel cladding tubes. These filled tubes are then arranged into gridded arrays called fuel assemblies. The cladding tubes are made of zirconium alloy it was Zircaloy  or  but moved to Zirlo or M etc.  Their purpose is multiple provide dimensional stability so coolant flows properly and control rods can be inserted protect the fuel from the coolant water it will damage the fuel have good heat transfer for high thermal efficiency have good neutron transparency for neutron efficiency and to keep fission products out of the coolant water.  Now the reactor environment is super tough on materials. Radiation and heat and vibrationstress and water...woo! So the fuel ends up eventually swelling from insoluble fission gas and the cladding creeps down because of high temperature and external pressure and the two come in contact.  Any time you change the power temperature now differential thermal expansion is going to add even more stress to this cladding refueling is fun because we keep the fuel in for three fuel cycles. The cladding would be ok with this if it were still pristine from the shop but thats a damn pipe dream.  Radiation causes crystal defects and the material literally swells. Then you have corrosion. Water is going to corrode the zirconium and we cant stop it  we have to design for it and try to minimize it. We want this stuff to corrode uniformly so it doesnt make any pinholes and fail unexpectedly.  So you get this hopefully uniform oxide layer on the surface of the cladding that builds up over time reducing your load bearing cross section and making it harder to get the heat out because its a great insulator.  But wait theres more!  You also get hydrogen doing stupid things because corrosion liberates H and O.  So this little obnoxious dude goes through the oxide and into the metal where its solubility is total crap but way better in hotter temperature than cold.  Once the solubility limit is reached it precipitates out as zirconium hydride particles.  Normally meh but over time they also degrade the claddings mechanical properties. We are trying to get all the energy out of the fuel that it has but cladding craps out before thats possible right now and those hydrides can really do a number toward the end of life acting as fast crack paths if they are aligned radially across the cladding tube thickness. And once you take the spent fuel out and it cools down  haha now you really have a lot of them and mechanical stresses dont just disappear in the lovely waters of Lake Cooling Pond or dry fuel storage cough neither does all the radioactivity cough.  The cladding has to keep holding up even then.So that is an intro there is more than that even but that is most of it.  This is probably one reasons why designs might seem a little nuts  this kind of thing we need to consider throughout the reactor.  At the same time I really do not know how much the designers actually discuss with the shop along each step of the way and it seems like from what you say there is some room for improvement.  Fabrication specs are so stringent because reactors do bad things to materials.  They screw up solubilities of oxygen and hydrogen and other elements they make materials weaker by radiation damage they screw up dimensions from creep and swelling. You cant put in a we!d with a void because while that sucker might hold when the part is new it probably wont after its been in service.  And failures can be catastrophic though not usually  just expensive. We have learned from past mistakes to design certain problems away like passive cooling in case of total electricity failure to the pumps but good designs working as planned requires fabrication to be RIGHT.  We want to provide clean safe cheap power dear God SAFELY.I think it is great if you want to go back to school! Having the handson perspective will make you very unique.

Unless that school is a designated AWS testing center and issues AWS certs its just a certificate of completion for doing the course. In my field pipe welding you will be given a weld test atas the interview. Passing this test will certify you for the job. Once you leave the job your cert stays with the company. You will repeat this process for every job you take. If you cannot pass a weld test you should probably practice on your own or take more welding classes for the knowledge. Throw out the cert they give you or dont... it wont make a difference. ,Welding,dbp680t,2,t5_2serw
10130372,0,t3_5kzdub,Welding staggerd intermittentd is  a very good suggestion  you could also try Tac one side at the ends and middle.  You may need more than  tacks depending how long the peice is.   Then weld the reverse side.  After it cools u can grind off the tacs or leave as is if you can.Flip the piece so you have a F joint. Vertical   and weld the piece with downhand progession.  Welding downhand will minimaize your heat input.Mig loves welding in the downhand.   Im guessing you dont need a certified wps  but if you do then make sure downhanding is permitted. more option is to make a jig that will restrain the piece while its being welded. Half inch thickness of plate would work.  Or you can tac on something like angle iron or round bar that will also prevent warping by restraining.   Make sure the piece is cold off b you remove any jigweld attachments.  Hope this helps.   Lots of times when asking for help u ask  people and get  different answers!.,Welding,dbrzr5m,1,t5_2serw

10540948,0,t3_5qx6t8,Travel is very standard in the welding trade.  If you dont have a soft place to land back home if things dont work out dont jump until you have enough money to sustain yourself  including travel costs for at least  months. Make sure you actually have the skills to strike out. A good welder without any hugely obvious personality defects will get hired within  interviews.  A shitty one wont get hired at all.  Have a Plan A a Plan B a Plan C up to a Plan Q R S if needed. The fastest way to crash and burn is to have all your eggs in one basket.  Survivorship bias is strong meaning you only hear the stories of the people who go out and succeed. You dont hear about all the other ones who went out and fell on their face. Before striking out you absolutely must watch the documentary The Overnighters.   which is about people who struck out and failed.  Traveling as a welder is like anything else in life. The better you are at planning the more risk you will avoid the less disasters you will encounter. The goal is to get to the point where you can make a shitload of money and ride the gravy train until the bust comes then ride off into the sunset with all the money you saved.  Make contacts make contacts make contacts. Never be a dickhole to anyone. Todays lowly helper is tomorrows full hand the guy next to you on the line might be the guy who hires and fires this time next year  Figure out what jobs have earned your loyalty and which ones havent but remember that at the end of the day every employer you might work for can and will fire you if it benefits them. That means you can and should quit for better opportunities if it benefits you. If you luck out and land on a golden lilly pad then stay on it as long as possible.  Figure out as quickly as possible just what you want out of roadork. If your only concern is money then chase that money but if youre at all concerned about a worklife balance constant travel can seriously cramp your style and eventually the money isnt worth it so the sooner you know your limitations the better.  Youre going to encounter a lot of assholes. Welders are what we are but traveling welders these are people you see for a little while then theyre gone and youre all just there to get paid. The travel niche draws in some real degenerates shitbags and some great guys. Be prepared to deal with them all.  The sooner you get a decent th wheel or reliable RV the sooner you can bank your per diem. Given that you can get a decent th wheel for like k and something to pull it for KK this is going to be a priority expense Your first.  Save your money. Gravy trains are temporary. Every day you work you should be saving for the days when there is no work. If youre one of those guys whos doing this to buy a  dually but you have  in the bank and rent a single wide trailer youre destined to crash and burn. ,Welding,dd2xmo5,10,t5_2serw

The presence of moisture basically creates an aluminumairiron battery. Worse the reaction produces a porous aluminum hydroxide which tends to hold moisture and condensation encouraging further corrosion.Furthermore in xxx aluminum grades the high stresses in fastener locations can lead to StressCorrosion Cracking. Example.The steel should be painted prior to the Al panel installation. It is highly recommended to use stainless steel fasteners for connecting steel to aluminum in any situation.Id recommend attaching the panel with  stainless selfdrilling machine screws.

11487156,0,t1_dfy0edd,Yep copperceramic is a good choice though aluminum would still work fine. Youd just need to make sure the backingchill bar is substantially thicker than the piece so the heat input isnt enough to puddle it. ,Welding,dfy2g6p,2,t5_2serw

I hope they do because I dont think Im quite an XXXL head haha so surely theyd have a cap for me.,Welding,dgegmnd,2,t5_2serw
11645705,0,t3_66492f,Not bad though. You know your mistakes which is good. I came back in the field game after a year in a shop and it took me a little while to knock the rust off too. It happens. ,Welding,dgg1yz5,2,t5_2serw
11649203,0,t3_66492f,Quick question what is DIN steel? DIN is a standard used in Germany and elsewhere so are you referring to a specific grade or do you just think that ASME steel is somehow inherently better? Are you just finding welding the cast fittings annoying as you should?,Welding,dggg974,3,t5_2serw

11752719,0,t1_dgpi4si,The flange was welded in the shop. Welded in flat position. The g weld was done in the field. You quarter your pipes when you weld them out. It can pull on you and it will if youre. It careful. ,Welding,dgs77tx,1,t5_2serw

11763804,0,t1_dgt9864,I have a wire wheel for a drill its pretty useless I need to find one for my angle grinder. I didnt shoot it but I did grind all the joints but only about  inch at most sometimes less I should have done more I guess. I also went back today and hit all the welds with the drill bit wire wheel and primed them Ill paint the gate this weekend probably. Im going to build a fence out of this type of metal about  feet worth so Im trying to work with it a bit before I do seems like I can do what I need to do already though maybe Ill bring a fan along for the fumes I never felt like I was breathing them in but just in case. ,Welding,dgtgg4n,3,t5_2serw
