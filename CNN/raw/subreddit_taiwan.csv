204506,0,t3_1wf5w4,. you have offers already from a chain school. This should answer your question no?.  a month is ridiculous. Most people I know in Taipei pay  USD or less... even for shortterm housing. Do your housing search when you get here. Not over the internet from overseas.

441585,0,t1_cfqanxw,Why not just visit first and see how you like it? Youve got an awful lot of your future predicated on an ideal of Taiwan that youve created for yourself but which might not reflect your own personal experience of the country. You can teach English here with no experience and any undergrad degree. Dont waste your time with a teaching degree as it will have no effect on your salary and a TEFOL certificate is enough to boost employability. Theres probably more job opportunities in programming than you think. Why not start applying for jobs before you get here? Keep in mind most Taiwanese companies work their employees like dogs with more than  hour weeks being the norm.As far as dating  marrying local its hard to express just how many obstacles you are likely to encounter that havent even popped up on your radar. I know plenty of happily married local  expat couples but Ive also seen the difficulties they experience and the problems Ive dealt with in my own.In the long long term I highly recommend you do some research on Taiwanese laws regarding foreigners. A nonTaiwanese foreigner will never truly be at home here. From the inability to vote or naturalize through the completely lopsided justice system theres a lot of subsurface stuff people miss out on until they are here a decade or more with solid Chinese. When you start to pull back the curtain on Taiwanese society things get ugly. I recommend you read through the complete archives of Michael Turtons blog for a good analysis. Not to turn you against Taiwan but just so you can get a better idea of the intricacies hidden from most short term visitors. For some background I was a full scholarship student in the MBA program at NCKU in Tainan. I quit after one term when I realized it was a total waste of time. Ive been here more than a decade have a long term partner and speak decent Chinese. Not claiming to be an authority. To quote a classmate who is still in the program I would never recommend this program to anyone back home after the way theyve bungled and mismanaged things.Again you can accomplish most of those goals with short term travel and intense study. Why not do language study exclusively. WenZao is a language university in Kaohsiung and offers several advantagesCheaper than Taipei by a lotCloser to real Taiwan less English and more Taiwanese the languageLots of good public transportation MRTClose to the beachBetter weather sunny and warm  of the yearFriendlier peopleJust do a month visit and see how you like things in Taiwan. If you want to make real money pursue a serious MBA or really crank up your Chinese go to China or Hong Kong. Taiwanese Chinese have a serious accent and use nonstandard vocabulary example the title for Miss here means Prostitute in Standard Mandarin  the economy is stagnant and wages are falling  years ago college grad started at NTk a month now its NTk and the universities in Beijing have world renowned MBA programs. Also Taiwan does have serious pollution problems  just like China and the rest of Asia. ,taiwan,cfqj9rd,2,t5_2qhrg

604344,0,t1_cg8vsaq,That is not correct.You are being manipulated by the ruling party.The public had no idea of the agreement until June  and it was only because an expresidential adviser found out about it and posted an article on it. After then protests forced the government to agree to return to normal procedure to hold hearings and then to review it clausebyclause.Before this time everything was done in secret by a delegation of  officials with no parliamentary supervision. In fact they were acting under only a set of  guidelines which required them to only report their results to the parliament afterwards.How is that not blackbox operation? How is that not secret? It is the same as if the United States decides to sign an agreement to supply nuclear technology to Iran and the U.S. congress only found out about it on Washington Post  hours before it.The  hearings held by the ruling party were squeezed into  days over the span of  days. For these hearings many interested parties like industry leaders union representatives scholars etc. were only informed of the time at the last minute or not at all making it almost impossible to attend.The other  hearings held by the opposition party were spaced out to  weeks per hearing and invited the right people.Then at the scheduled session in parliament to deliberate on the agreement itself the ruling party physically obstructed deliberation making it impossible to perform the actual review which the ruling party agreed upton for  straight days.At the end of the scheduled sessions the ruling party then cited an unrelated clause which applies to executive orders not trade agreements that are classified as prospective treaties to deem the agreement to have been past review.You are being manipulated by the ruling party propaganda. I know you will not believe me because you already think Im manipulated. So please look up when exactly those hearings you talk about were held. Look up the attendees look up what those boycotts they were referring to and then look up the facts I refer to in this post. Compare them. Please do.,taiwan,cg8yu2s,0,t5_2qhrg

636420,0,t3_21exx8,I would like to remind people who keep referring to the democratically elected Ma administration of a fun mostly forgotten scheduling quirk of the last election.. How did a man with a  approval rating get enough votes to win by several percent only two years ago?After historically holding elections well into March the KMT moved the date of the election for . The election date was changed to be  days before Chinese New Year during exams for many students. So many could not afford the time or money voting would have required. The proximity to  the New Year also guaranteed that people with less money migrant DPP supporting workers that have taken over New Taipei City could not vote since they would have to make the trip back to their registered household twice within one pay period.It massively affected turnout of likely DPP voters and no one ever talks about it but I remember being enraged when it happened.

637298,0,t1_cgcp22p,I am not an legal expert but I dont think its about whether the rules are legal or not but whether the rules themselvesas it was applied in the current situation violates due process.  In this case the minority opposition did not get the chance to grieve  In other words the minority in parliament were not giving a fair chance to be heard.  I understand that the DPP was underhanded in the way the delayed the review but thats a different issue.I also think we need to consider the possible repercussion from all this too.  Basically the KMT can introduce any laws filibuster and delay the procedure it for  days and not give the opponent any chance to reviewrespond.  They can basically do that as long as they have the majority.  Abusing the article  can lead to rather unfair consequence for the minority.Regardless of what I think the bottom line is that the protesters are suggesting that the way it was handled was undemocratic and violates due process.  If thats the case I dont see why they shouldnt be filing a case to the courts.  There is also a disagreement between KMT and DPP as to weather article  applies to international trade agreements too.gtlastly line by line review of a trade treaty is a bad ideaI dont get this.  So does that my treaties and war policies should be passed with complete lack of transparency from the people?  Why cant you do a linebyline review and make a holistic conclusion afterwards?

KMT didnt just kill thousands of Taiwanese they killed over ten thousand Taiwanese many of them the thought leaders and leading academics of their generation. Then during the White Terror era over  Taiwanese where imprisoned.Not everyone that came with the KMT where the best and brightest of China as you might have imagined.gt The majority were from hinterland provinces and were unfamiliar with paved roads with a developed communications system or with simple mechanical devices which had long since become part of everyday Formosan life. We saw them frequently carrying stolen bicycles on their backs wandering about in search of a barter exchange or a buyer. They did not know how to ride.gt ... snip ...gt For many weeks crowds of soldiers stood about on the main floor of Taipeis principal department store gaping at the wonders of an elevator service. KerrIts kind of idle speculation to guess at what might have happened had the KMT never made it to Taiwan. Certainly its likely that the United States would still have pushed for its containment strategy of communism and continued to support a Taiwan separate from the Chinese Communist Party. Or maybe not.But its all kind of moot now. The current generation of youth grew up in a free and democratic Taiwan to parents that were born on Taiwan.

773909,0,t1_cgs041x,True to your username! To answer your question yea tuition is pretty expensive. Many of my own friends have mentioned to me that tuition is a bit high.  Although tuition is about K USD for the full year not K like you mentioned. From the people who I have reached out to that have attended the program they have mentioned that it was worth every penny of it since they all came out the program extremely confident in their mandarin capabilities. From what Ive seen and heard ICLP does a really good job at filtering out the people who are not serious because  the high tuition costs and the letters of recommendation that you need to obtain.  Lets face it it is a language school which are generally paytoplay and what you mentioned about their requirements is pretty general.  I do believe ICLPs reputation and other requirementstuition recommendations really do serve to gauge who is serious about their studies which create much better environment for learning.Having said that Im banking on getting the Huayu scholarship offered by my countrys TECO office so that should help reduce some of the costs.

1155147,0,t1_chzk3h7,Right. Its that lack of doing health check thats significant. The purpose of the sign isnt to keep the dirty foreigners out of our good clean toilet. Its to make sure people doing the health check in high volumes can move through the process quickly.I agree it singles out a group of people People there to do their health checks as opposed to people there to poop at their leisure while they wait for a family member. I can only assume this bathroom is in the area that foreigners must go to do their checks and that its at a hospital that gets a lot of people for that purpose. Here in my town health checks for foreigners are almost entirely done at the local branch of the  hospital which is where I go for regular stuff and every time I walk past the clinic for the health checks theres always a line out the door of English teachers and domestic care workers and engineers all with ARC in hand. To me its completely reasonable for the bathroom thats used for people to pee in a cup to have a stall available for said peeing especially since its otherwise right off the lobby and waiting rooms and on the way to every other part of the hospital where youre gonna get plenty of other people going in there. With the exception of the ER you cant get to any other part of the hospital from the main entrance without passing that bathroom.Ill be the first to bitch about foreigners being mistreated when it occurs. But this isnt that. Theyre not singled out here because of their foreignness. Theyre singled out here because of the volume theyre passing through here for a bathroomrelated purpose.I havent been to this hospital in question. But if its anything like the one in my city having a stall available for the constant flow of a specific kind of traffic seems not at all unreasonable. I dont have any problem with the stall being set aside. I have a problem with the English translation since it gives the perception of racism where none is present.

More and more foreigners move to Taiwan every year and most foreigners Ive known are grateful and respectful but there are some who are unstable. There need to be repercussions for this type of behavior not just public shaming.Edit Theres no excuse for this but at the same time it happens. It could have been a local who lost his temper but because it was a foreigner and from his accent an AmericanCanadian it reflects badly on all of us foreigners. But assault is assault and people who assault other people especially in a public place should be arrested. I hope this guy gets caught and punished but I also hope that if this gets reported in the news that its not framed as an epidemic of crazed foreigners assaulting public servants.Edit  so as it turns out hes not really a foreigner and the TV news has reported this. The driver is not going to press charges so its just going to end up being a loss of face after all. The fact that this guy is a fake foreigner as the news is calling him  speaking only English because of the special treatment he receives  brings up an interesting aspect of Taiwanese treatment of foreigners.

Complaining about that is not complaining for the sake of complaining. No I do not give the KMT any credit for the Taiwan we have today. They resisted democracy  Chiang Chingkuo deciding that democracy may be possible on his deathbed doesnt undo decades of KMT brutality.

As they currently are the KMT is an old ancient  princeling dominated unchanging relic that refuses to adapt and appeal to the next generation of Taiwanese.

2953951,0,t1_co3cgvr,This article is also quite old .The author also cherry picks his sources to present his worldview that Taiwanization is a carefully crafted political plot rather than a response to the  years of KMT thug rule on the island. Citing the Teachers Association is just plain stupid as most of them vote for KMT anyway for the sweet sweet  pension. Where is his counter examples of how the KMT literally rewrote history books to block any mention of ACTUAL Taiwanese history such as the Japanese occupation or the Portuguese influence on the island. Many people who grew up during the KMT era were brainwashed into learning about greater China to the extent that many couldnt even name simple geographical locations within their hometown. What Chen did was merely trying to get the education system in Taiwan to actually teach about the island its inhabitants grew up in rather than learning useless information like learning about every province in China and memorizing  years of emperors. Of course Chen did this in a partisan way. He had to there was no other option when the KMT stonewalled everything Chen tried to do. Chen and Lees policies have given Taiwanese people only two choices to renounce China or not to renounce China. I dont see how this is a bad thing. Renouncing China means finally breaking free of the international bullying that the mainland has over the island not to mention would you really identify with a country that actively threatens you with missile attacks while blocking international participation in events such as the World CupOlympics? Heck China even blocked doctor access to study the SARS epidemic years ago simply because Taiwan couldnt be part of the WHO. Thats just sad.

3914535,0,t3_359gqb,I guess Ill be the different voice here and say that living in Taiwan has changed me for the better. Unfortunately the nature of being a typical foreigner in Taiwan can make it very difficult to become a better person. The thing is for the average foreigner by which I mean a white male younger Anglospeaking ESL teacher life in Taiwan can be very very easy and this is a double edged sword. We make a lot of money and the cost of living is low. Its easy easier to get laid. And if you dont give a shit about being a good teacher the work can be very very easy. The point is its easy if you are a foreign male ESL teacher to just become a manchild. Especially if you choose to blow your disposable income on booze. I reached a crisis point a few years back where I saw myself becoming one of these manchildren. I decided I didnt want to do that not that Im noble or something it just frightened the shit out of me to imagine myself as a bitter  year old pounding beers at the  and chasing  year old club skanks in my cargo shorts. The fact that foreigners are generally able to make a lot of money is good if you learn to use it to your advantage. If you work hard and save so that you can move onto something else its great I have several friends who hated teaching and have now moved into starting businesses of their own. Or if youre like me you can take advantage of the fact that you can make a living and not have to work all the time if you live outside of Taipei you can survive on teaching  hours a week if you have some savings. Ive used the time not having to work to improve myself by learning skills guitar organic gardening yoga and exploring creative pursuits. Just dont flush it down the drain on fucking booze yall.

4202518,0,t3_390639,For burritos you can try Juanitas near Zhongxiao Fuxing heres a review from  or Macho Taco near ShiDa review from  here. As someone else recommended you can try Eddies in Tianmu  review here. Also I remember seeing last year a burrito place open in Shilin I think it was King Burrito. I think its closed now which if true isnt surprising  their burritos were insanely expensive.As far as I recall the burritos from Mach Taco are similar both in taste and price  about ? for a basic burrito without extras like guacamole of which at both restaurants you only get a tiny bit and its expensive. I say skip it. Juanitas provides Tabasco and Tapatio hot sauce but Im more of a Cholula kind of guy. Can you get better burritos back home? Of course. I would say both Macho Taco and Junitas burritos are pretty average. Note if you think Chipotle is the endallbeall of burritos then sadly youve never eaten a great authentic burrito. What exactly is the definition of an authentic burrito anyway? That said Id rate Chipotle a bit higher than both Juanitas and Macho Taco.I just happened to eat at Eddys this weekend having had the fajitas sopes and fish tacos. Everything was good I thought the fish tacos were quite good actually. FYI Eddie is from Canada with family from Guadalajara. Can you find better back home? Yes of course but I think thats an unfair comparison  at a minimum the available ingredients andor quality of those ingredients in Taiwan may be sufficiently different such that no matter how skilled Eddie is or authentic his recipestechniques are the food will never taste quite the same as in America Mexico etc. For example Taiwanraised pork tastes noticeably better different not necessarily better or worse than most Americanraised pork. Also a restaurant may have to alter a dish to better suit Taiwanese taste preferences Im not necessarily saying thats the case at Eddies.Oh and yes  whether its a burrito or dishes at Eddies the prices across the board will be higher. At Eddies I spent  which included the above dishes  fish tacos  sopes a glass of beer  and a glass of horchata  far too sweet for most Taiwanese people to enjoy I think. It was admittedly a lot of food for two people but we were quite hungry and wanted to sample a few dishes.,taiwan,crza172,7,t5_2qhrg

If your yardstick is not growing the economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis then thats a pretty wide net youre fishing with.

When you varify the source of an article you google the names of the organizations names of the people involved in it etc.  So this is already a bit suspiciousSecond I have done more googling with key words in the article too.  And I notice that the picture provided and the article sourced are all from this  And all the other webpages with these keywords cite themselves back to this article.Third notice that this article reads ...  And then it reads   Meaning that they are considering to take more more legal actions to make it so that the Ministry of Education cannot successfully add the slighly changed curriculum in August.And it seems that they have implemented legal action to the court.  But....     Even more telling the court seems to have rejected the legal action.  Now its not just Udn reporting this Cts Dailynews Sina myformisa Apple News  etc all agree.Now I gotta say if they had to take more legal actions to get the court to get the Ministry of Education to stop.  It sounds like in the court ruling the loser is  and its lawyer.  And now they still lost.  Its not looking like the Ministry of Education went against court ruling.  So even the link you provided me Liberty Times admit that the court ruling is in favor of what the Ministry of Education does.  So the lawyer has to take more actions which got defeated just yesterday.I believe that the students are free to protest peacefully.  No vandalism and destruction of property.  And most of all remember that it is not the KMT that went against court ruling.  It is you protestors that are trying to go against court ruling.

If your group is being ignored entirely the tactical situation may require you to occupy or disrupt before opening communication lines.Occupying is a tactic that fits into the overall nonviolent approach developed by Mahatma Gandhi Martin Luther King and so many others. An example is Selma to Montgomery  when protesters marched under severe police brutality in order to force open a discussion about voting rights that were being denied to people.An undisciplined occupying is however not very wise as it detracts from the actual goals.

If Crimea has shown us anything hybrid warfare is how Great Powers will leverage their military superiority over weaker opponent so to avoid precisely what you describe.Regarding the highly probable internal insurrection that would occur from such a take over the CCP is trying to address the issue your raised in your second point through diploeconomic means. The emphasis on trying because when your efforts are disingenuous as seen through the CCPs dealing with Hong Kong charm offensives quickly lose their momentum. Economic and infrastructural measures such as the BeijingTaipei highway fresh water pipeline and FTAs are less fleeting as well as offer the KMT incentives to be subservient so expect more of these proposals in the future.I would recommend keeping an eye on this thread as it has some interesting analysis on the situation. ,taiwan,cuq1v22,14,t5_2qhrg

Hoklo people migrated earlier to Taiwan than the Hakka then there were a lot of conflicts between the groups.  Most Hakka people now lives in Taoyuan Hsinchu and Miaoli historically more hill areas than the south in a way they were driven to the area of less desirably by the Hoklo.In order for KMT to maintain control over the majority Hoklo they basically utilized the conflicts between different ethnic groups so Hakka people tends to be proKMT in a sense that the enemy KMT of my enemy Hoklo is my friend.What I found personally is that Hoklo people have minimal understanding of other ethnic groups mostly out of ignorance.  Ive spoken with my Hoklo friend on how Taiwanese includes everyone its not just the Hoklo culture even when they are the majority and that POV taken by the Hoklo really annoys the Hakka people.  My friend was actually shocked to hear that perspective because they just never think of it this way.I am guess the aboriginals feel the same way since they were driven into the mountains by the Hoklo as well.,taiwan,cyy8ybz,7,t5_2qhrg

6422155,0,t3_43nnep,What kind of gift would be suitable to bring? Price range?First of all things that arent suitable to gift at any time clockswatches sounds like which is end umbrellas and shoes both asking someone to leavewalk there are more but these are just off the top of my head. You wont be expected to give out red envelopes but you can buy a couple bags of CNY chinese new year assortment candy from supermarkets to hand out to children. Often theyre from some local brands like this but youll now see some other candiesgummies like peach rings or gummy bears. Buying swallows nest or chicken essence  is a no go as theyre more for family member to family member but youll see them beautifully wrapped in supermarkets. How should I address his younger sister mother father and paternal grandmother? How should I address random family relatives that show up during the holidays?Ah Gong paternal grandpa and Ah Mah grandma is probably more commonly used than Yy and Ninai I think. But do follow the family and your friend. Normally if my friends were to join in on my family CNY theyd be calling my relatives the same way I call them does not apply to the momdad obviously. If the parents speak English then Mr.  and Mrs.  would be more appropriate than calling them by their first names. If not uncleShshu and auntiey is a pretty safe bet. Do Taiwanese have particular bathing habits? I.e. is it expected to shower at night? Limit the time?No bathing taboos although showers gtmins is a bit excessive. Depending on their bathroom keeping their floor outside of the shower stall or bathtub area fairly dry helps. This is just good manners. If they dont have a shower stall theres nothing you can do. If there are bones in the food should there be a designated place to put them while eating? Ive heard in China people just spit them out on the table.A lot of families have these paper trash box folded for bones. If not try keeping the bones on the side of your plate. I personally dont spit them onto a paper towel since it would get their table cloth wetoily but if its disposable and plastic table cloth then  feel free to do so. Spitting it out on the table is gross.Should I wait until others start eating before picking into the dishes? Am I expected to serve my friend or others portions of food as they eat? Yes. Even with visitors it should always be the elders that start the meal just the one or two oldest at the table not everyone older than you. After that you are free to pick into the dishes. If youre on lazy susan circular table with spinning middle plate it is still recommended that the elders get their portion first before spinning the plate to anyone else. If the parents insist to serve a dish to you first its on them. Normally there would be a full chicken full plates of fish a broth with lots of things inside and other dishes. The only thing to keep in mind is to not go for the one per dish items. Some examples are chicken butt fish head abalone etc. Not because its bad to eat them youre probably not interested in it anyways but again the elders get the first pick.Should I always empty my bowl to show I enjoyed the food or leave some to show Im full?Someone did mention that when you go for the soup its a good indication that youre done. Another good indication that youre full is going for the fruits. Fruits and dessert usually come after soup anyways. You shouldnt leave food in your bowl but you can leave some leftovers on your plate if youre not too fond of finishing it. No taboos here either. Im sure you know of the no leaving chopsticks upright in your bowl of rice rule. What do people do on the eve of the new year and the morning after? Are there appropriate greetings?Xin nian kuai le and gong xi fa cai are the two most common ones! Itll be fun to learn other phrases from the elders and your friend.Any taboos I should be aware of?Youll probably receive a red envelope from your friends parents as a nice welcome. Do not open up any red envelopes right away. Enjoy your CNY! ,taiwan,czjl5i2,10,t5_2qhrg

These are reasonable given the huge long life expectancy in Taiwan and how its rapidly rising.Or we could continue to pay out  until the system collapses and everyone gets nothing.In the end I do support the NPP plan for this.

Honestly speaking I have no idea either.To most parts of the world Taiwan doesnt have a strong identity beyond night markets. If you want history for westerner you visit Europe to see where most of the major western history took place. If you want Asian inspirations you go to India Japan and China. Something in between? Turkey then. Beaches... most people would first think of Thailand if they plan going to Asia.The concept of Taiwan is vague. Oftentimes I heard comments like similar to Japan a Chinese country but more westernized or mixture of China and Japan Thinking of all these I guess thats how western countries look at Taiwan. But for Asians people are drawn to Taiwan for food for a Taiwanese movie scene for a democracy etc. To be precise the tourism bureau is not lacking of marketing effort.

10279542,0,t1_dc97ic7,Again the context is what the students were against in the past had a legal loophole. Do you finally understand what this labor law that was just passed seeks to address? Finally!In fact the second report is from the MOL themselves.Now that it unpaid overtime is illegal the MOL can go after these cases too. In the past unpaid overtime was basically legal as long as you say it is the responsibility of the employee to complete said tasks even though it was not completeable under normal working hours. This harmed specifically student employees of schools and other jobs who were assisting in major papers or projects that couldnt be completed under  hours a week. Now that it is not legal to do so and that you must pay overtime the MOL can go after those cases.This is WHY theres the hourly limits to weekly work time to force employers since the old law regarding overtime wasnt easily enforced.Youre assuming the MOL doesnt go after any labor violation cases at all just because they couldnt go after a legal loophole in overtime in the past and then painting that as an assumption that it must mean they were ineffective.Do you finally get the whole point of all of this? What the Tsai bill is meant to do? What the problems with past overtime pay violations were?Those four major universities are now under investigation by the way.,taiwan,dc98qhg,2,t5_2qhrg

10763819,0,t3_5tzg4s,It depends on how you define culture or Chinese culture. I view culture as dynamic and Id say China is where many people have lived and many places in the world share part of its civilization. Taiwan happens to preserve some part of it a certain period of it. But if you view culture as a collection of historical relics NPM and maybe some museums in the West are where you find traditional Chinese culture. If you regard living styles and religions as the essence of culture many people in Taiwan and many in SEA happen to preserve some of the authentic cultural experiences e.g. Taoism and Buddhism in Taiwan. The Chinese may believe in a religion but in modernday China there is only one they should worship no matter they like it or not.  ,taiwan,ddq7i3h,1,t5_2qhrg
10763895,0,t3_5tzg4s,You seem to be misunderstanding what Chinese culture really means.Throughout history the land know as China continuously saw the rise of Empires their downfall intrusion of barbarians from the north mixing of cultures with the barbarians and creating new Empires afterwards. And every Empire almost invariably ended with a retreat to the south surviving a while and then eventually falling to the barbarians to the north. This mixing of cultures meant that Chinese culture was never static but rather a changing concept broken in inheritance multiple times along the way. Sometimes the remnants of of the previous Empire might be able to pass on its customs language and legacy for a while for example the Min dialectlanguage is older than all the others as it is closer to what Han dynasty Chinese would of sounded like while others were developed later in the Tang dynasty. It is because the Min area was first civilized near the end of the Han era and many choose to escape there when Barbarians intruded at around the same time .So in a sense what we have here is no different. I wouldnt call the communists barbarians but what they did is just about the same as the barbarians of the past  destroying the old and mixing in new. Its just the same Chinese culture but adapted and morphed by time. Taiwan would serve as the last holdout of the old Chinese culture but not necessary more authentic or correct than China itself.Even Taiwan itself is highly influenced by US  Japanese culture and modern Globalization. Were losing more and more of the traditions that we once had and the meaning they entail. This is most visible during the Chinese New Year where this year  for the first time ever  I didnt realize its already AM because nobody set of firecrackers in the entire neighborhood. There were no dancing dragons and lions none of the food that used to each mean something through puns. We actually had pizza for dinner. In that sense many Chinatowns in the western world might even preserve Chinese culture better than Taiwan did as those traditions meant even more to them than to us.I think one of the most telling thing is that Koreans and Japanese would wear their traditional clothing on occasions but Taiwanese have none of that.,taiwan,ddq7s8k,21,t5_2qhrg

10821848,0,t3_5uqru3,I dont know if people stare at foreigners a lot. But a common secret practice in my circle is before ordering anything we would pretend not to look at peoples dishes in a restaurant but we do try to figure out whats in their dishes to decide what we should order. The same practice for street food because we are always hunting for foodsnacks. If we go to a new night market we observe peoples food and their reaction. Basically thats a common skill to determine how you can get the best of the market. Sometimes its not about you its more about food. If people stare at you but youre not eating I guess theyre really staring. BTW its considered inappropriate to stare at or talk about dishes on the adjacent tables but it depends on the age the place youre visiting.,taiwan,ddw742f,15,t5_2qhrg

However they in general werent marginalized nor disenfranchised under the Japanese versus the Qing nor the KMT. In fact Taiwanese political clubs were free to talk about Taiwanese self rule. There were political clubs that even included communists and socialists to full on democratists that met regularly and even had offices. Pop music on Columbia Records and the radio in Taiwan in the s would feature womens suffrage among other weighty topics. This isnt always the case for the aboriginals in Taiwan at first. They were also given a comprehensive education and medical system light years ahead of anything they had prior.If anything compared to Martial Law under the Chinese Nationalists it was multiple layers better.gtBut to say Im Taiwanese period would be disrespecting the original owners of the land the indigenous Taiwanese.Virtually any nation would then not be able to call themselves any nationality then. Not Australians not Americans and definitely not the Chinese themselves.gtI know KMT was a horrible dictatorship especially when they took control of Taiwan. CCP freakin destroyed Chinese people and culture great famine amp cultural revolution. But who we are shouldnt matter with which government is in charge.I think this is where our perspectives differ the most. I agree with you and this is why I prefer not to hold onto that Chinese identity. Sure our ancestors were Chinese at least for most of us. But the Chinese government that came to Taiwan enacted nearly half a century of one of the most oppressive governments on earth the deaths of tens of thousands in a surveillance system that extended even to democratic nations abroad. Even back in China they committed the state slaughter of  million innocent Chinese civilians.This is why theres so many Taiwanese that prefer to be called Taiwanese  theyd rather be connected to the land and rule themselves.
