22301,0,t1_cegvvmg,He merely applies real life logic to games. He KNOWS that in the game it destroys Termina. He KNOWS Ezio and Altar survive leaps of faith. He just goes out to prove that in real life or under simple laws of physics things in video games couldnt happen. Mostly its satire and at the end of the day everyone is entitled to either believe in the lore of the game or to dismiss it and take it at a realistic  perspective. ,zelda,cegz0kz,1,t5_2r61g

76147,0,t3_1uwgn8,Congrats! Zelda is my favorite series of all time and Im glad that it had enchanted a new player. Theres some kind of charm some spirit in Zelda that just cant be found in other games.I will say though that your decision to tackle Oracles next is...odd to me. Good games to be sure but theyre about as removed from OOT as can be in terms of game design and chronology. These games flow the adventure of the hero from ALTTP. If youre still open to opinions I would recommend The Wind Waker or Majoras Mask. Majoras Mask is my favorite game of all time and follows the Hero of Times story directly. Furthermore if OOT pulled you in with its world and atmosphere Majoras Masks world is is about ten times more atmospheric and the richness of its world makes OOTs Hyrule look dull and boring in comparison. Its truly a masterpiece.If MM is my favorite game of all time Wind Waker is my second. I place WW above even OOT in overall quality and it would be a fantastic followup to Ocarina of Time. It follows the adult timeline and many references are made to OOT and the events thereof. The games story has the best one of any Zelda game in my opinion the world is phenomenal and the game hasnt aged a day. Even Ill admit that Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask feel aged to a degree but Wind Waker is so brilliant and so fluid and so beautiful that it could pass as a brand new game even today. I cant recommend this game enough.,zelda,cen3jag,1,t5_2r61g

86358,0,t3_1v2ur1,Honestly for me the most touching moment has always been the bridge scene in OoT with Saria. Even though she ends up playing a part later on in the game there is a certain sadness in his leaving behind his home and all he knew. There is a longing in Sarias gift even though it is done out of compassion. In some ways the moment is evocative of both the pain and pleasure of nostalgia and the inability to ever truly even with a magical Ocarina return to the past that once was.,zelda,ceo9ehz,4,t5_2r61g

Throw bomb arrows at their feet repeatedly this is how you separate them when they are armor free backslice them until they die. Helm splitter works well too.  Repeat with the other three.

Even with the most ideal settings it wasnt as accurate as a normal controller would be.The ratio between what it adds and what it takes away was just way too unbalanced if you ask me.   of the things that motion controls supposedly make possible could be done on a controller more easily and more accurately.So I agree with you.,zelda,cfsa8am,1,t5_2r61g

Simply put No.Zelda is a series full of huge full epic releases and Four Swords is more of a sidegamespinoff based around multiplayer.  It lacks most of the key elements that make up most full Zelda games and because of this it definitely shouldnt be where you start.  Its more for a bit of fun on the side for people who are already into the series.Id start with Ocarina of Time Twilight Princess or Wind Waker.

775589,0,t3_2312xs,Im probably not gonna have the most popular opinion on this one but Id love to see a style similar to Skyward Sword opposed to Twilight Princess. Dont get me wrong I love the style of Twilight Princess but I dont want the series to evolve into this dark and gritty world  much like how everything else is having this darker tone to it. I feel like Skyward Sword was a nice way to blend Twilight Princess and Windwaker. It was different at first but I think itll help make it stand out compared to everyone else thats going the gritty route.As for the story I would want something to run in connection with Lorule. I tried doing a timeline of the of the other worlds dark world twilight realm lorule a while back Incomplete idea and Ive come to the realization that even though the light world has a singular timeline the dark worlds and Lorule does not. With the Triforce being restured in Lorule I think itd be nice to see how it goes in the future as an indirect sequel. ,zelda,cgsft0h,7,t5_2r61g

1211791,0,t3_27zodf,Well enjoying others disappointment is a douche mentality. Its not because you havent shown interest in a remake that Nintendo thought the same. Just do your research before being sick of anything.There has been many hints pointing toward a remake. All these Easter Eggs in ALBW included. Many players have been asking for it for more than two years. Even Miyamoto himself said that if the fans want it we will get it.Its not just one entry in the franchise its OOTs direct sequel and one of the most unique Zelda in the series. I think its perfectly fair to be disappointed. Now of course thats not to say Zelda WiiU is pointless or less interesting but we know less about it for one secondly its officially announced so well likely only get worth mentioning informations in the upcoming months. As for now there is nothing to say other than Link looks fem or its stunning. We dont even have the games title lol.Whereas MM is still waiting for any kind of confirmation. I guess thats where there is a priority concern on here.PS I must mention the delicious irony. Youre sick of hearing about MM remake yet you just opened a thread about MM. ,zelda,ci5y0uu,3,t5_2r61g

1236996,0,t1_ci8devx,The game flat out tells you. Which part specifically? Right at the beginning you get turned into a deku scrub and meet the happy mask salesman. The HMS tasks you with getting his mask Majoras Mask back for him and hell turn you back to normal. Easy.So Tatl tells you what you should do first go find the great fairy. Again pretty easy. Just run around clock town for a bit looking for the great fairy. Maybe ask around.The game is fairly straight forward. Once you get back to human form it opens up a lot but has the main goal always right in front of you as Zelda games typically are.If you dislike that I feel like you dont really like Zelda games in general and probably will start disliking them in the future as they return to their roots. The next games supposed to be even more open than any of the others.,zelda,ci8s16j,-1,t5_2r61g

It keeps me coming back to Mario and Zelda games time and time again. ,zelda,ci9yw9x,1,t5_2r61g
1247987,0,t3_28cmi0,I recommend starting from SS and working your way down the timeline till you get to OoT. When the final fight goes down prepare yourself. There are several possible outcomes to this fight.If you succeed on the first try with more than half health play Adult Era Child Era then Defeated Era. Youre a champ and deserve to play Wind Waker ASAP. If you survive with half or less than half health on your first try play Child Era Adult Era then Defeated Era Young Link has met with a terrible fate and dies after he returns to his time probably internal bleeding leading to the quite morbid Majoras Mask.If you die thats it stop playing OoT and start playing The Defeated Hero Timeline which is  games long. Once youve finished the Defeated Hero Era redo the Final OoT battle and refer to the play order of the top two bullets minus the Defeated Hero Era and the first try thing.Have fun!,zelda,cia0inv,5,t5_2r61g

1274444,0,t3_28orgl,I dont have any its my favorite right alongside Ocarina of Time.The complaints I generally see not in any particular order. The graphics Some complain that they havent aged well. Others hate the toned down more realistic colors.. Difficulty its not a particularly hard game. While Id argue that a lot of that is thanks to awesome controls and being familiar with the types of puzzles the series has not like any of the other D games are really any harder and I dont think this is the right series for people that want a lot of difficulty not everyone feels that way. . Huge world everyone says they want this. Then they complain about it. People complain about Hyrule Field being pretty sparse and the world not being populated enough. They complain about having to go back and forth and how tedious it is.. Not everyone likes or connects with Midna. Shes a huge part of the game and not liking her is going to hurt the entire experience.. It tries to hard to be dark is another complaint I see pretty frequently generally from the diehard MM is  fans. I think MM had darker stories sure but I also dont think TP was actually trying to be as dark as some claim.. The forced wolf portions. Many find them boring and tedious. A lot of people didnt care for that mechanic. I enjoyed it and felt those parts were pretty short so it never bothered me but I can see why it would bother others. I wasnt a huge fan of being stuck as a Deku in MM and that was a whole lot shorter.. Some have only played it on the Wii. I feel bad for them. Those controls drove me nuts from the start I absolutely hated trying to figure out fishing with that remote. It was not fun. It would have been really hard for me to get through the entire game with that. The Gamecube version is like a freaking dream come true controlwise. Theres others. I can see the merits in quite a few of them others... not so much. ,zelda,ciczqdl,8,t5_2r61g

I personally subscribe to the idea that Hylias chosen hero was reincarnated into the Link we play in Skyward Sword by a spell cast by Hylia herself. This idea is outlined in the Skyward Sword Manga that many people say is noncanon but I find fits nicely into what is undeniable canon. Others claim that this is simply the way life in Hyrule exists and that we as players are supposed to suspend belief and accept that everyone is endlessly reincarnated though this has little to no supporting evidence.  ,zelda,cijy15k,4,t5_2r61g

1526972,0,t1_cj7bnwl,I know everyone doesnt have the same opinion. It seems a lot like theyre relying on the mere fact that the game uses Legend of Zelda characters and environments to sell the game to the fan base. Sure some people may like it I may have some fun with it as well but I cant seriously sit down and feel like the game is high quality. Seriously just looks like a copy and pasted L.o.z. universe in a Dynasty Warriors gameplay setting. They could have done so much more for a spinoff of this game could have even made some kind of coop game with similar mechanics to the regular series. Youre getting completely off subject with your whole who are you to talk down on their choices. comment. You seriously arent mature enough to read criticism of a game you may like without getting all defensive? It just doesnt seem like this spinoff strives for quality. They could probably dish out two of these games a year easily is that the kind of games you want? Or would you want a well thought out game with worthwhile featuresadditions and real replay ability? You realize im criticizing this game as a fan right? That I may genuinely disappointed with the direction theyre moving the series in?

1595073,0,t1_cjg4bdd,Haha yeah I spent hours getting Twilight Princess running perfect in HD and widescreen only to notice something was up with the bloom once I started playing.  I googled it and learned that Dolphin simple cant render the bloom right in higher resolutions and it stuck out like a sore thumb throughout the entire game.The problem is that the bloom works kind of like an overlay sitting perfectly on the outlines of everything and in higher resolutions it misses those outlines and renders where it would be in p.  So it looks kind of like a broken stereoscopic D doubleimage.  Its mostly noticeable in the Twilight where everything is massively glowy.,zelda,cjg890l,1,t5_2r61g

It can be used as a decoy to confuse enemies or to solve puzzles that would require two people but you cannot control both at the same time like the song of command in wind waker. If the marionette takes too much damage it disappears and has to be resummoned. Must require magic to summon rather than control as animating a puppet would take a lot of magic.,zelda,cl5tjoz,1,t5_2r61g

2119505,0,t1_cl981g7,Yeah. Without giving spoilers theres a certain mini game in which the swift sail is a possible prize. After you get it you press A once to activate the normal sail and then A once more to activate the swift sail. So if you have the swift sail but dont want to use it the only real drawback is having to hit A twice to turn the sail off.If you have a Wii U I really do recommend the game. Its not an allnew experience but it has a number of new polishes and features that made it feel fresh at least to me. And thats even considering that I finished a playthrough of the GameCube original less than a month before getting it. And the Miiverse social features are the most fun on the system thus far in my opinion.,zelda,cl98h06,2,t5_2r61g

However the story leading up to it is interesting how it plays out is fun and you still have a climax that wasnt expected.The actual events that lead up to Link waking upas far as Im aware are unknown and we dont know what Sheik is doing when shes not helping Link.

You had to have the skill to stay alive and the ability to solve maddening puzzles or you simply didnt go any further.Nowadays if you get stuck theres fifty things making sure youll know exactly what to do and pretty much everything drops more hearts than theyll ever manage to take from you and its ridiculously easy to keep a full stock of extralives in your many bottles.

Shes so cute yet so gloriously weird with her obsession with all things bug and she even loves creatures most people would find disgusting like snails ugly stag beetles or scary mantises.   The fact that she loves them all equally just adds to her charm.   And as has been said she looks through the world with innocent eyes to the point that a wolf that has everyone fleeing with terror she merely thinks is a puppy and tells him shed like to play with him when she has more free time.     I also identify a bit with her as I used to keep pillbugs and snails as pets when I was little.   My favourite was a little yellow snail called Buttercup I was very sad when she escaped the castle I built for her. After that I am very fond of Peatrice.   She reminds me a bit of Anastasia in the CInderella sequels.  Between you and me Id pick her over Zelda.

SwordShield comes at around an hour and  minutes.This guy takes about two hours.This guy with the title not the goats again lol is the quickest with about an hour and  minutes.This one comes in at around an hour an  minutes.So going with that trend it looks like the average is about an hour and  minutes just like I said before.So then what?

Navigating them isnt much of a chore once you get far enough in each since youll unlock shortcuts not unlike what you find in Metroid.Aside from the glitch that can screw your save up Nintendo has a channel to fix it and theres a Gecko GCT to prevent it while playing my only complaints are the Beetles inability to fly straight once youve steered it and the fact theres no landbased way to travel between the three areas. Had there been tucked away paths to get to each area Id have been thoroughly satisfied in the level design department.If youre a Zelda vet the puzzles arent particularly hard but they at least incorporate something besides blocks. Each item retains a use throughout the game too something I cant say about OoT or TP.The trials dont worry about it youll learn later were really cool too. A lot of people disliked them and compared them to the Tears of Light from TP but the change in gameplay and your utter vulnerability added excitement and depth to what would otherwise be a boring fetch sequence.tldr its one of the best D Zeldas  behind Majoras Mask in my book. SS is the realization of the promises that Nintendo made about the Wii. It uses every feature possible of the Wii to mostly successful effect.,zelda,cmrqaj5,2,t5_2r61g

2851939,0,t1_cns9822,I think its a bad port mostly because they tried to lazily patch glitches from the original. In some instances they actually caused a much bigger glitch. Many people accidentally ended up in Jabu Jabu as adult by trying to get to the Ice Cavern. Many people also started the game with random items such as Megaton Hammer on B. Its insanely sloppy. There was no excuse not to have Boss Rush online leaderboards. Finally they for some reason changed the falling mechanic to where if you hold forward while falling you take damage instead of rolling. Its a pretty fatal flaw in development of a game when a Deku Scrub tells you to hold forward while falling to not take damage and that mechanic isnt in the game anymore.I suppose that OoTD is fun to play but I dont see any reason to play it over the original N version.,zelda,cns9kpu,-2,t5_2r61g

There were several problems with TP. One of them was the methods used to teach which didnt blend well with the normal gameplay and were on the mundane side. The other problem was the quantity.Dungeons are interesting enough to break up the monotony so by putting the Deku tree in the middle of world building they made it less of a chore to get through it all.What was more impressive IMO is they made the break believable it didnt seem arbitrary as you are implying going and doing the dungeon was a natural part of the storybuilding process.

2930223,0,t3_2tp8on,Now that you mention it A boss fight similar to Shadow of the Colossus or Dragons Dogma would be pretty cool. Just one boss fight though. I dont think there are alot of series Zelda could borrow from without becoming something completely different.Other than that I really just wish TLoZ would start to include more significant sidequests again like they did in the early installments. No more arcadey find  poes and i give you rupees. or stuff like that. Sidequests that a have a small story line and b actually make a difference.That said Im always open to new ideas. So what do you think would be cool things to add to TLoZ?,zelda,co16ewm,2,t5_2r61g

2950078,0,t3_2ty4fz,I think remake will not happen maybe they will make some sort of sequel though.Now Wii games are being ported to the eShop they might do the same with GameCube games simply because of the adapter you still can play GC games on Wii U if they release the titles digitally heck.. Probably with a software update its even possible to let the Wii U read GC discs it only needs to emulate a memory card.They could make it so probably needs to reprogram the game for that part that you can use your DS or DS as a controller which will let you play the game the same way as the original with a GBA and multiplayer! and GC controller also available for single playerIt sure is possible but I dont think Nintendo will do it any time soon.,zelda,co3frj6,1,t5_2r61g

I think a mix between the two would be nice where it follows your arm but it doesnt have to be incredibly accurate. Trying to make sure the thing was calibrated right and trying to get the sword to hit a specific place when it just refused was really tedious so if it was all or nothing Id rather it go back to a button than full motion controls.,zelda,co578d0,1,t5_2r61g
2968059,0,t3_2u61a8,November . I didnt have a SNES when it was current and I never got the Zelda games for NES when they were new. I remember following Ocarina of Time when it was still Zelda  in Nintendo Power. Then I saw the ad. Preorder at Walmart and you got a gold cart. I did this. The day it came out I was hooked. I could not get enough of Ocarina of time. Then Majoras Mask came out. I had never been on an emotional trip like that in a game. It felt like a living breathing world and I was enchanted.

3060152,0,t3_2v682m,Its a fun theory to explain why characters are repeated but it doesnt quite hold up with certain aspects of the game. Particularly in the theory Link falls asleep in the woods which arent in Termina but in the end he rides out of Termina on his horse. So how did he get from one place to the other while asleep?Plus theres the fact that even after Majoras Mask is defeated were treated to scenes showing that Link really did help the people of Termina. Link is no longer wearing the mask and therefore would no longer be asleep under its control so why would everyone be celebrating that he saved them?But those things aside it is a fun theory and Id love to see this theory relate more to Links Awakening. In one you have Wart who lives in Subcon. And its overtly dreamlike. I think if this theory really wants to hold up there need to be more parallels between Termina and Kolohint island. Even though theyre different Links there seem to be some constants throughout the dream worlds in Nintendo gamesAlso yeah a TLDR in the post text itself would help ,zelda,cof6k3x,1,t5_2r61g

The Gorons are just calling you brother because you helped their people in time of need saving many of them. Twinrova is probably just giving a wink to say thats right! because it was a surprise when the two sisters fused together to form one enemy. From the side view on N at the beginning of the bestowing gift animation it looks more like the gift is coming from her chest not her crotch. When it shifts to the front it does look a little more crotchal in source but I dont think its on purpose.

3209595,0,t1_cotk5ue,Im not  sure that everyone involved with making the game agrees that Termina is real within the context of the series.In the article that OP links to Aonuma himself says this about Termina when asked whether reusing OoT assets was for timesaving or for a stylistic choice ...You know we described it as being a nearby land but in feel its almost like another dimension. Even though these characters have a similar appearance to the version of them that appeared in Ocarina they express something different in a different world.His wording of you know we described it as... has a barb of disagreement with the official Nintendo version of Termina.  He then goes on to directly say its almost like another dimension.In replaying MMDS lately I cant help but notice the weird transition that the player sees when first falling down the hole in the woods at the beginning of the game.  The colorful sprites that circle around the screen the  degree twist that Link goes through when he first gets to the area.  Its all very surreal.I can see a version of events where the Termina exists solely as a dream or a neardeath experience.  That would fit both the idea that Termina is a sort of purgatory where Link deals with the loss of Navi in a way note that he never gets Navi back in MM.  Then he wakes up and is free to live his life out and fulful the lineage mentioned in TP and the Hyrule Historia.,zelda,couo9fs,1,t5_2r61g

It could be as simple as the power of a goddess moving adult Links consciousness back into his boyhood body the moment before he planted the sword to start his hibernation.  Of course that means he has to undergo the hibernation every time he returns to the future.  Then again he hibernated in a separate dimension so his seven years could be an instant in Hyrule.

3503978,0,t1_cprmpnp,gt its definitely no Majoras MaskFor most of the game Id agree its lighter than MM but Id actually argue that at the end the two flip positions. At the end of MM The moon is sent back into the sky Majora is defeated Skull kid is sorry and all is forgiven. Thats a pretty happy ending for such a dark game. Its because all of its darkness is in the impending doom if you dont successfully help these people. The credits are happy as all hell except for the Deku butler. The only sad thing left at that point is that the Zoras never find out Mikau died.Wind Waker on the other hand has you fight to save a sunken Hyrule only to reach the conclusion that its too fucked to save. The King basically apologises for his part in fucking up the world and then resolves to kill himself in the process of allowing Hyrule to be destroyed. Yeah he tells you to go off and find a new land which gives it a certain element of hope which leads into Phantom Hourglass but it still essentially ends on a remorseful but well intentioned King accepting death to absolve himself of guilt.,zelda,cproff1,7,t5_2r61g

When Midna reveals her true gorgeous nature before leaving forever. I actually cried. And Blizzetas mirror possession. Eek. In Majoras Mask one time I didnt catch this alien that sneaked around the barn and seeing the abduction and then Romani look so depressed afterwards was hard for me to take as a kid.

3948769,0,t3_35nbyo,Ill be the odd one out but I still prefer the original version over the Wii U version. Honestly the game looks better visually on the GameCube to me since when they changed the art style for Wii U they gave it a sort of claymation effect that I didnt care for. The original artstyle fit the game more in my opinion. Also theres way too much bloom lighting on the remake.Theres also a bunch of little things that they changed that I didnt care for such as making all the sunken chests contain the same treasure and making the waiting time while getting said treasure very short. I understand that the game had some tedious moments but this is supposed to be an ocean but the short waiting time makes it seem like a puddle. I also didnt care for some of their solutions to cut down on waiting time like the swift sail though Im glad its optional the butchered Triforce quest though I understand why it was done as well as a few other things. Maybe its because none of the tedious things about Wind Waker bothered me I dont know.The HD version does have some good moments though like adding Hero Mode.I suggest watching this review as I share nearly all of these opinions and MathewMatosis is better at wording his thoughts than I am.,zelda,cr6e6mz,4,t5_2r61g

It messed up navigation and I would always hit one too many ice disks so Id have to go all the way to the bottom then go back to the second floor then hit the button then hit the other to make the pillar go back.  Then Id punch the disks get what I needed then in order to get to the next place I had to totally reset the pillar again blah blah blah.  It was so tedious.

4956446,0,t1_cuitvnp,gtThat was a different time period for gamers.You say that like there arent still games nowadays that treat the player the samesimilar way as they did in the ss.  There are.As was stated by others before designing your game around new players while neglecting the experienced fanbase the biggest reason Zelda games sell is bad game design.  Better balance for this was found in WW and TP which while easy dont shove it in your face like you have issues with the basic fundamentals of gaming.  No one except those who have never touched a videogame before would need the excessive help that Skyward Sword bombards you with.Options could solve this easily or something as simple as a journallog that keeps track of things youve learned rather than having you learn it multiple times throughout the game.  Its not a sign of the times  not all games do this  its bad game design and even Aonuma made a point to say that the next Zelda wont be that way because even he admits that direction was a mistake.  Miyamoto himself even referred to this whole sort of deal as pathetic.gtTheir attitude is OK I am the customer. You are supposed to entertain me.

You collect so much of it and for the majority of most of the games your wallet is full. Skyward Sword was a good start in that you can upgrade your items using money and other collectibles butI really like how Link between worlds made use of your money. To rent and eventually buy your items made more practical use of your rupees. I think future installments should make better use of your rupees!,zelda,cvy9uaz,2,t5_2r61g

5524932,0,t3_3qmelk,Interesting theory! Although I always associated their personalities with their respective voices from the Four Swords Adventures game for the NGC. Red Link had the highest of the  so automatically I felt like the manga did a good job in building upon that by making him the Link with a kind heart. Blue Link on the other hand had a deeper voice than Green so I associated him as being more hot tempered as shown in the manga as well. Purple Link had the deepest voice of them all but it sounded less of an angry deep and more of a mellow deep similar to Vios cool calm and collected attitude in the manga.Aside from their voices the artwork actually impacted how I viewed the different Links. On the Shadow Battle artwork Red Link is depicted with a prankster kind of look implying that he has a light hearted care free attitude. Blue Link as shown on most of his artworks has his mouth open aggressively showing his teeth. Finally Purple Link is mostly depicted as being angry too although his mouth is always shown to be closed this gave off a reserved attitude to me.Sorry for typing up an essay haha. Your theory is really neat and makes a lot of sense! I just thought I would share my observations with you as well ,zelda,cwhuyo1,2,t5_2r61g

That being said seasons is definitely creative in the use of the gameplay gimmick i.e. controlling the seasons.

5928690,0,t3_3wjwa1,gtIs there a way to play with random people online?Yep. Theres even a banning feature that allows a certain player to not be paired with you again if you meet any unsavory characters online. The online pairing system is also region locked so take that as you will.gtDoes it get repetitive in terms of the dungeons and puzzles?In the game there are eight worlds that contain four dungeons each and each world has its own theme. Fire Ice Forest basic dungeon motifs Id say within those worlds puzzles repeat as they usually feature the same items to equip but Ive yet to notice a puzzle from say the Forest temple that was reused in the Earth temple.gtHow much do the costumes affect your gameplay?. Are you forced to do some levels in specific costumes? Or is it more of a customization option where you can pick whatever you want in a level and just get certain advantagesdisadvantages from that?Its definitely the second answer. No one costume is needed to complete the dungeons so you could essentially go through all of them with just the Heros Tunic. Some of them are a bit more useful than others and some make puzzlescombats easier there are a few that boost one specific items powerspeedrange which are especially useful in the world centered around that item but none are required to play with.gtWhen playing online what happens when one of the players DCs?. Does the game kick everyone out?Sadly yes. In this situation you could remember the name of the person who disconnected and blacklist them if you ever get paired together again but not much more can be done about it.gtWould you recommend the game?Absolutely. Some people dislike it for being too silly but thats just why I enjoy it. You really arent missing out on anythig by not having nearby friends to play with except for two specific costumes that you can only get by playing locally. Theres even a single player mode if you cant connect online although its marginally harder without two other players to back you up. Also there is a PvP mode that puts you against two other players instead of with them but it really isnt the major focus of the game. A large part of it is collecting materials as rewards for completing dungeons and using said materials to make costumes for yourself. It really is a fun system. Finally heres the Den of Trials but I havent completed it yet. The reward at the end is really great though!,zelda,cxws6fj,2,t5_2r61g
5929493,0,t3_3wfw3k,Based on what you have at this moment you can get A Link To The Past And Four Swords GBA The Minish Cap GBA brilliant game Phantom Hourglass wouldnt recommend it too much Spirit Tracks wouldnt recommend this one very much eitherBut almost everyone agrees me included Ocarina of Time is one of the best games ever. It is more where the series started than the first NES one. Id recommend you trade in your DS andor some games and procure a DS a New DS XL if possible. With that you can play Ocarina of Time D a faithful port with an added twist Majoras Mask D A Link Between Worlds Hyrule Warriors Legends in  not a mainseries gameAnd heres the kicker on that not only can it play old DS games but it can play the first  Zelda games thru VC. TLDR Mate buy a DS.P.S. Do you have any other consoles? Answering this would help greatly.,zelda,cxwvywe,2,t5_2r61g

6061347,0,t3_3yjz1n,Id like to see it happen and think it is entirely possible to make an engaging maturebutstillaccessibleforkids cartoon. I would like it fit into the canon timeline in some sort of timebending way where the reveal is that the cartoons Link and Zelda are dangerously close to being ripped out of the cyclical nature of their destinies. So they exist separately and the other versions of themselves are trying desperately to inform them that they mustnt let that happen. This way the animation itself could take on various trips to different known Hyrules and styles in fun and remarkable ways. The first third is establishing LinkZeldaHyrule as we know it and concludes with the first peek into another world. In this first act the evil as always is creeping into the land of good and nobody has any good explanation. Zelda is more susceptible to suddenly speaking with former selves or getting glimpses of these other worlds so she is secretly working on reaching out through her network of people to understand. Link is in play mode and more or less is unfamiliar with his heroic tendencies of the past  so he spends this period merely adventuring and stumbling across peculiar leads on hardtofind items... perfect for his evergrowing collection of artifacts and treasure.The turning point happens when a piece of the world is ripped open and a flood of creatures comes pouring through. Link is drawn to it by luck of his latest treasure hunt taking him near and Zelda is there already trying to prevent it. We see through the shreds of worlds clashing dramatically that there is an evil presence trying to get through. Luckily however Zelda with help seals this tear in the earth while Link fearlessly slashes through the terrifying beasts.At the end of the battle among ruin and chaos Zelda and Link meet... and they realize they have to collaborate to even begin to understand what is going on. Even if they at first dont get along.,zelda,cye4xjj,2,t5_2r61g

You become stronger.In Zelda you dont typically have levels but you do gain items and can obtain tunic upgrades and such. One of the brilliant elements of Zelda is you often become stronger by literally becoming more skilled at something  not simply by increasing a stat number. Example Learning how to best toss bombs so they land where you want and explode when you want.Anyway I can see both sides of the argument. I have no issue with it being considered an RPG. I would personally classify Zelda as an adventure game first and foremost.,zelda,cypoo1p,35,t5_2r61g

There are so many ways to attack the enemies whether you want to use your sword incapacitate them with your tools or even use their own tools against them. Or you can make them attack each other if you jump out of the way in time.None of which has to do with difficulty. In fact some of that disarming them making them hit each other makes it even easier than it already is.gtThe most shallow combat in a D Zelda game is easily TPs wolf combat.That we agree on.

I love you.Any of these are just as viable as the next.gtthe relationships everything was trying to push this game to be more than a childs gameElaborate.  In what way are these things beyond that of what youd expect in childrens media?  Theyre the same things youd find in pretty much any anime with a young audience as its target.  These things are not adult theyre adolescent at most. Things which are adult tend to focus on things like politics in the broad sense morality philosophy hard truths of life and loss etc.  Not teenagers in love or mild sexual appeal no.  Those things are commonplace in media designed for an adolescent audience and even Nintendo admits that TPs style came down to nothing more than a marketing decision made to capitalize on the rising trend in realistic graphics in the mid s.gtEarthbound Fire Emblem Majoras MaskNintendo publishes Fire Emblem they dont make it.  Its an IS game.gtdont you think they have a deeper meaning then an imp riding on the back of a wolf?I dont because Im not one who buys into the idea that Nintendo has a thousand deeper hidden meaning hidden away in their games.  Now why do I feel that way in the sea of people who believe otherwise?Because Nintendo themselves say that is not the case and its painfully apparent.  Nintendo has always claimed that their games are primarily about gameplay and that any story in them comes dead last.  This much should be obvious to pretty much anyone because even their most indepth stories only reach typical animelevel at best.  Everything else is extrapolated from a tiny basis by passionate fans.  Its why the Zelda timeline is a reconnected mess and why the vast majority of their games feature literally no story beyond save the thing.There are some exceptions like EarthboundMother which was a labor of love made from the directors feelings about his recently deceased mother and Majoras Mask which was Aonumas debut as a director in a newlyhuge D industry but even those are stretched beyond reason by fans who pick everything apart looking for what isnt there.  Its because Nintendo stories are simple and ambiguous leaving a lot of room for fans to insert their own ideas but that doesnt mean any of those ideas are true.gtAnd why else would they push her sexual appeal so much?I dont even understand this one.

7150174,0,t1_d1qvt1d,Even after playing previous Zelda titles theres still an adjustment period while acclimating to new mechanics in the form of abilities and tools so I would say its less of getting a hang of the Zelda series as a whole. I would argue that a large part of the loz series is puzzle solving not just combat. Once youre aware of the solution that sense of adversity is eliminating so subsequent playthroughs dont have that same sense of accomplishment or feeling of difficulty.That being said does this formula diminish the fun of multiple playthroughs and if so should it be changed for that reason?,zelda,d1qwhwy,2,t5_2r61g

7321128,0,t3_4fnn13,Want. At least a little bit of reasonable challenge.. A large classicalmedieval styled soundtrack.. An open world that functions like a world with physical barriers and item mechanics that can only be overcome after you find the toolsabilities to do so.. Multiple towns with an NPC cycle system similar but more simple to what Majoras Mask had.. Lots of secrets..  The ability to influence the direction of your jump midair seriously Nintendo why was this removed? It does nothing but make platforming elements way more clunky.  The ability to independently use your shield again again why Nintendo?.  Big unique dungeons that are designed in a way that makes them seem like more than just a dungeon like the Forest Temple or Snowpeak.  Having them be connected in some way would be awesome as well.Not want.  An energy pool system like ALBW had..  Sprinting that relies on meters and energy fruits.  Id love for sprinting to return but not in the form of a powerup collection and and meter watching..  A bubbly animethemed story.  A cross between Wind Waker and Majoras Masks story styles would be ideal. A vast empty world where the gameplay consists almost primarily of walking like Skyrim.  If you can get anywhere simply by walking straight in that direction and mashing A I will be very disappointed.  Thats not a world its just a boring sandbox to enable combat and space out the content..  An itemrenting system that turns adventuring to find awesome tools into going to the convenience store..  Some random gimmick that puts a limit on gameplay for the sake of being different like the idea of only being able to carry  items at a time as some people have suggested..  A story thats handled through story missions rather than a progressive flow of events.  I hate that most modern games do this its just an incredibly artificial feeling way to handle a story.,zelda,d2ad1a9,11,t5_2r61g

I for example cant fathom playing a Zelda game with a name on my file that isnt Link and Ive played almost all Zelda games that way. Link shouldnt be like a Pokemon character who is simply your projection but be sort of an individual. Weve even seen different Links have different personalities. WW Link is all goofy yet still very brave while TP Link is more serious and maybe cautios around the unknown like the first time he meets Midna. ,zelda,d2l3rlj,29,t5_2r61g

7646592,0,t3_4k1fha,gt The temples are cool but many are too long and theres just so many of them. Having to go through three? as young Link and then becoming an adult and finding out that I had to do five more just made it feel like a chore.To make things worse everything is so dark as an adult. It was incredibly lonely and while that couldve added to the atmosphere it just started feeling drab after a few hours.To me templesdungeons and the little quests before you enter them make a Zelda game what it is. So I personally enjoy having  dungeons. Adult Link wakes up in a world of darkness ruled by Ganondorf  years later. Link is literally from another better time and ended up in a world of darkness where everyone lives in fear or has disappeared his only friends were the Kokiri and they dont recognize him because he grew up. So that lonely feeling fits the game in my opinion.That said everyone has their own opinion so not everyone has to like OoT. I personally dont like the pacingdungeonsday limit of MM that much although the weird atmosphere makes up for that.,zelda,d3bdjpj,6,t5_2r61g

7846582,0,t1_d3y05h8,Ah yes I had only skimmed it before but Old Castle definitely has some progression similar to what you hear in the Temple Theme around .  Maybe she is inspired by Kondo but remember that its very common to hear similar progressions just about anywhere in music.Ive been studying Koji Kondos music for about  years and I think the similarities here come from their classical and jazz backgroundsinfluences.  Both make use of techniques you dont typically hear elsewhere like excessive use of modes harmonics and more interesting time signatures and rhythm.  Asian composers also often have different ideologies in their compositions as is the case with most cultures but most of the similarities youre hearing are coming from Classicalinfusedjazz which I am a big fan of.And haha its a bit funny to me that youd cite Zeppelin and Uehara as your favorites as both are very complex and technical while Skrillex in the middle there is very simple comparatively at least on a music theory level but production is its own thing.  Nothing wrong with that though I like simple music myself.Shes an incredible pianist and composer though and Im glad I was able to learn about her today.  Seriously impressive.

You need a specific item. When areas have a locked route with a lock symbol you need to use an item on them to unlock the map usually a hookshot on hookshot markers or a raft on green wooden piers.If memory serves Princess Midna is in or close to the top right.

7995534,0,t1_d4e415q,Id have to disagree as far as landmarks go. Theres a sense of continuity in how the land changes from game to game. If you look at Lake Hylia from TP and compare it the one from BotW bridge and all theyre basically identical. Not saying this is  THE proof but its solid and its where Im putting my money for the time being. Besides the Temple of Time moves around from place to place via renovation or the continent falling or what have you but its only existent from the Alpha timeline through the you guessed it Child timeline even in its various stages of ruin. Its lack of placement in any other continuity is Id have to argue really important.As far as Koroks go... Its a really big assumption to make but its entirely possible that the Kokiri still became Koroks in the Child timeline. And from what we know about Koroks anyways theyre just spirits of forest children like dryads or a more cultural reference like kodama inhabiting those forms. The very last we see of the Kokiri in the child timeline was the lone skull kid possibly referencing THE skull kid from MM so its hard to say what could have happened. All Im saying here is that I wont rule out the possibility that they existed there too. They could also just be spirits in general and that they dont show themselves to just anyone. In the footage we see finding a Korok results in it exclaiming You can really see me?As far as which Link if any got revived I acknowledge that it might not be any particular one weve seen. And as far as the Master Sword goes it seems from the footage shown that it hasnt been housed in the current Temple of Time since the Temple is shown to be in ruins and the sword itself is elsewhere presumably in the wilderness in its pedestal  la Link to the Past. This detail is almost certainly related to the story at large and hasnt been given for this reason. As for why its chipped and rusted its likely another detail thats storyspecific and wont be revealed until release.And as far as Wolf Link goes I would suppose its convenient for BotW to happen in the Child timeline some time after TP. Up until now they havent had anything remotely like that be canon unless I forgot something somewhere. I dont think theyd abandon continuity here specifically in a place where it matters as much as it does for where the game happens in time.I dont have much else to go on until someone remembers some ungodly obscure detail that will throw our perspective off here. All Ive managed to do is narrow it down based on previous trends and timeline events enough to the point where Im almost certain the other two timeline branches cant support BotWs placement.,zelda,d4ervg7,1,t5_2r61g

8013825,0,t1_d4gjzks,gtPigDemon Ganon can only exist in one timeline you then imply that the Koroks can only exist in the adult timeline.I guess but lorewise I dont see Pig Ganon as a result of anything terribly specific but rather multiple possible reasons.  I dont think its ever explained and if it was please correct me but turning into a boar beast is kind of Ganondorfs goto thing whenever he gets power.  Even in Wind Waker in the timeline where he never transforms his puppet boss is a giant boar monster.  The legend in WW that shows him returning also shows him as a boar beast despite the fact that he looks human when you actually see him in the game.Koroks on the other hand evolved for one very specific reason  Because Hyrule flooded.  They also had one very specific purpose which was to restore it to its previous state.  Their existence was very specifically tied to Wind Wakers ocean while Pig Ganon isnt really tied to anything other than the fact that weve not yet seem him there.  Koroks being there are pretty solid evidence but Pig Ganon not being in that timeline yet is more about a lack of evidence. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.Besides I dont think Calamity Ganon really falls inline with the typical Pig Ganon anyhow.  Yes they could reexplain the Koroks but that would require more of a rewrittenretconned explanation than Ganon appearing as a beast again.  As for Gorons  contrary to Majoras Masks gameplay  they are not really harmed by water they just cant swim.  Twilight Princess shows that not only can they survive in water but they can also apparently breathe in water or just dont breathe.It fits the downfall timeline too.  I think its equally likely that it will end up being either there or postflood.gtI also dont understand why proponents of the Adult Timeline assume that Hyrule is simply going to drain and resurface. Didnt the king wish for old Hyrule to be flooded?Mostly the thing that supports that it will happenwas supposed to happen was the Koroks.  Their sidequest in Wind Waker was basically kickstarting the revival of that Hyrule.  Yes King Hyrule wished for it to be flooded still but someone could have easily wished for it to return or maybe that isnt even necessary and a Triforce wish isnt permanent or maybe so much time has passed that much of previous Zeldas magic has diminished. Seas do drain over long periods in real life as well.gtI just dont see why Nintendo would bring back the old Hyrule in that timeline when if they want to use it as a setting again they have both the Child Timeline and the Downfall timeline.No real reason other than someone directingwriting it thought it would be interesting.  Nintendo is king at making things happen for no other reason than thatd be cool.  I think its equally likely to take place either postflood or in the Downfall timeline.  The only thing that sways me towards either direction is the Koroks and their very specific purpose.,zelda,d4gtu87,1,t5_2r61g

He scolds the targeting system of OoT but fails to address how revolutionary it was for its time. If you compare these with other open world titles of the era such as Mario  which is a great game the freedom and exploration of games like OoT and MM  not to mention the awesome story telling elements that made each and every NPC part of a larger world in MM  was pretty much untouched by anyone.I get what this guy is trying to say but he completely contradicts himself throughout the video. Zelda games are known for innovation  pushing the industry further. They did this with the original Zelda they did this with OoT and MM they did this with the art style of WW in a time where photorealistic games were the standard and they did it again with SS which is still the best motion controlled game Ive ever played.

Of course this is predicated by the understanding  that these people myself included do not want to trade player agency for more storyscripted sequences whereas some other players will be fine with that.Hopefully this helps you understand the hate Skyward Sword gets.

Youre never a mage youre never a rogue or thief or Ranger or anything like that. Its an Adventure game with certain mechanics that are common to RPGs like an Inventory Loot and equipment with Stats.Its the same sort of thing to me as The Witcher .

8353890,0,t1_d5jl68y,Yeah but i think Nintendo wants this to be the phenomenon of the Series like Ocarina Ocarina splited the timeline into three so maybe something similar could happen maybe they merge together or a major event happens. The timeline placement is going to be hard this time around before we can tackle that challenge we should probably try to answer questions like what happend over the  years? Who is calamity gannon? If we can can answer those than well get a step closer to the timeline placement. I think its linked to Skyward Sword one way or another alot of areas are named after Hylia. Heck their is even a Hylia statue in the Temple Of Time. I think Sheikah technology is Timeshift technology maybe their linked since the timeshift technology has the sheikah symbol.,zelda,d5lsfdf,1,t5_2r61g

8565439,0,t1_d6b7j8d,Its not that it would lead to anything bad its just inaccurate. Especially as the change is intended to bring more accuracy when in reality it makes it more confusing.Wikis arent designed for people who know everything already. That is literally the opposite audience for Wikis. If I were completely ignorant of the series which I am for many other series that I visit wikis for I would see Shiek and see the pronoun as He. I would then think that either he is a male or that he is transgender and identifies as a he. Both are inaccurate interpretations. Shiek still is still Zelda who is still a female although the persona of Shiek is a male. Crossdressing and disguise is not the same as transgender and almost the opposite. It is a special case and cant be accurately summarized in a single word.Even the case which the moderator rests upon is shakey and does not warrant a full wiki wide change. If the team feels that it is important to make the pronoun distinction it needs to also recognize that it is giving innacurateincomplete information. We know many of the characters are likely cisgendered. Nintendo has given no indication otherwise and it is a misrepresentation of a series however minor.,zelda,d6c9bqu,-1,t5_2r61g

8756170,0,t3_5004lg,I love this dungeon probably my second favorite in twilight princess. The dark mist would make you remember your wolf abilities so you feel like youve mastered your skills since being cursed at the beginning of the game. Keeping the sol from the hand mightve been annoying for some but I loved how you were under pressure. and Zant was using everything he could possibly throw at you. Floating helmets illusions twilight beasts pterodactyls and bats everything is there to kill you.This is also where the master sword gets powered up and gets a golden glow. SHIIIIIIIINNNYYYYYYYY  I thought the fight against the Zant illusions were the only bad part of this dungeon. You hit him kill some enemies run up to him before he teleports lather rinse repeat. As for Zant himself... I ADORE this fight. We saw Zant as an intimidating leader in the twilight army he was menacing and terrifying when you run into him in lanayru spring. But now you know he was just imitating Ganondorf this whole time. He wanted to please his god like the suckup hes revealed to have been since he served the twilight king. Hes a broken man and has gone insane looking for recognition for his work and hes taken his need for attention way too far. Hes given so much more character in one cutscene I love it. The fight itself just shows how much of a screwup Zant really is. He copys every boss fighting style since hes so inexperienced in fighting since hes just been gifted his magic and summoned minions to do everything for him. He cant adapt well to his environment he swims very slowly in the morpheel section and doesnt expect to be knocked off his totem polls. When he realized link already knows how to deal with everything he goes for his own final push. He uses his sloppy swordsmanship. Spinning until hes dizzy randomly waving his dualwielded blades and teleporting at points where it doesnt make sense just to confuse you.  The music in this boss even represents Zants slow descent into madness. It starts off menacing more instruments are added the beat gets faster. It sound upbeat at points and reaches the point where theres so many instruments at once that you cant tell whats happening.  Sorry if this turned into an analysis of the Zant fight more than the temple itself. This fight just really makes this dungeon for me.,zelda,d706h4c,42,t5_2r61g

Aonuma confirmed in an IGN interview back in June that Breath of the Wild was purely a singleplayer focused game.gtI would like to take what I learned from Breath of the Wild and see if we can somehow fuse those learning points into another multiplayer Zelda Aonuma told IGN at E . For example with Triforce Heroes which followed a similar format of Four Swords there was a multiplayer involved in that game. gtThats definitely a possibility and we will continue to experiment throughout the Zelda franchise he added.gtThe answer came in response to a question regarding previous comments made by Aonuma in a Nintendo Direct. Back in  the Zelda series producer said he wanted to rethink the conventions of Zelda and allow players to complete dungeons and scenarios in any order. But at the time he also mentioned challenging the notion of playing by yourself.gtAonuma admitted that throughout the Zelda franchise hes done a lot of experimenting but despite that he confirmed that Zelda Breath of the Wild will focus purely on a singleplayer experience.Source,zelda,d7c1i9e,5,t5_2r61g

8942524,0,t3_52qe0b,a lot of people talk down on great bay temple but in my honest opinion the dungeon is well designed the mechanics just suck to deal with from a gameplay perspective and probably could be solved with an improved map and some better markings to find way aroundthe dungeons in majoras mask I dislike are the  stealth based mini dungeons. deku palace while not poorly designed in layout has skewed punishments for mistakes and an unintuitive sense of where to go first few times wandering through. considering how early it is in the game the punishment of going back to beginning for failing the deku flying section is absurdthen the pirates fortress obviously a reinterpretation of ocarina of time but with one major flaw. in a zone intentionally maze like that forces the player to replay areas when they make one mistake forcing players who do not have enough bottles to do it several times over is a poor decision and just punishes players who do things in what Im assuming designers considered wrong order despite stuff being optional like most stuff in majoras mask,zelda,d7mrd1x,13,t5_2r61g

When Link is struck by lightning I believe he has a near death experience that being the game. I do believe the Windfish is a real creature but I do not believe personally that Link was in the Windfishs dream. I believe Link was dreaming and the Windfish was able to enter Links dream and provide some direction for Link instead of mindlessly wandering his dreams and never waking up.

This results in the creation of the Adult and Child timelines and gives far more importance to the Downfall line.,zelda,d95y3ob,10,t5_2r61g

9434629,0,t1_d9bu6po,I mean considering its one of the Links with the most personality I guess I dont mind it much but theyre slightly off putting lol. Ive always been used to a relatively soft face for Link and then suddenly odd lips and strong eyes and eyebrows?? Please. You cant do that to my frail heart.I like the Tears sections  theyre better in the HD version because theyre just a little shorter and thus at a more fitting length. Its a good introduction to Link and his destiny by interacting with the Light Spirits his wolf form Zant the Twilight add something new to exploring give Midna a lot of screentime and gradually introduce the area to you without blasting you with info. The music is fine for the area but gets on your nerves quick which makes the length of it tough! To get people into the series I would absolutely recommend Twilight Princess  it was my first Zelda and a good way to get in.

Was that just a time and money saving decision or a stylistic choice?Eiji Aonuma Really it was a little bit of both whether it comes down to the decision of saving time in the schedule or it being more of a stylistic decision. I think a lot of it comes down to those character models having the ability to express something that they couldnt in the setting of Ocarina because we had this very different image for the world where Majoras Mask takes place. You know we described it as being a nearby land but in feel its almost like another dimension.

10067417,0,t1_dbjseo5,They did watermark it. They just didnt ruin the whole picture by putting watermarks on every square surface. The thieves cropped out the watermarks. The post explains all that. Its the artists job to put a watermark or signature on their work if they want credit. Its not their job to completely compromise their art and quality to prevent all possible theft. They could just put out a thumbnail with OC DO NOT STEAL across the whole but that ruins their work. Once you start cropping out other peoples watermarks and stealing their content youre at fault . It doesnt matter if the artist didnt use every possible tool to stop you they still tried to stop you youre still doing it anyway  and its still your fault. In this case where an artist wanted to share their work with the community for fun they did everything they reasonably could. They used watermarks they signed the work and they shared it using official accounts so that they would get credit. If they had taken any more extreme steps to prevent theft it wouldve made the art less enjoyable for the community which would ruin the point of sharing it. And uploading things at lowresolution doesnt have any effect at all on these sites. Again if you had read the post you would know that this site doesnt always send out the art people order and when they do fulfill orders the prints are often low resolution and hideous. Many of these artists are doing everything you want to prevent their things from getting stolen and it is still happening. Theres no excuse for this. Im not sure why were having this discussion. ,zelda,dbjt2ye,12,t5_2r61g

10264868,0,t3_5myyin,OOT link is one person though. He doesnt actually travel through time he persists through time.When adult link goes back to being child link hes essentially sending time itself backwards. What hes done in the future persists because hes created a separate timeline by doing it but both timelines contain one link.Adult Link results in Wind Waker because in the bad future Link never returns. So when Ganondorf rises again nobody comes and the gods flood Hyrule. He goes back in reverse to be a child again and warn zelda and thus never goes forward. He never exists again in the bad future.Child Link results in Majoras MaskTwilight Princess. He leaves Hyrule and never comes back. The hero fails timeline is a speculative But heres what might have happened timeline. So adult link could never go tell child link before he knew anything or anything like that. Time Travel in OOT is like riding a tram back and forth. Its not like in other media where you ride a tram to the future and then can circle around on a separate track that goes back to before the station or anything like that and see yourself waiting ahead at the station. It is pure back and forth. The second station is created when Link gets on the train but if he never goes back to it the people there never see him again. Link set off on a different station when he told Zelda that the first station was a bad idea. But he only told her that after he had already gone there and made it exist. Make sense? Its rewinding like in Life is Strange. Retaining memories and actions but setting everything back to before they happened creating timelines where those memories and actions took place. Life is Strange perhaps not being the best example as the game does imply multiple timelines with multiple Max iterations. But you get the idea. Its like a VHS tape. Forward and back.

You dont have to go Gee shes a cartoon character theoretically its possible that the developers just didnt add any indications that shes older and just made her without wrinkles and with large round features which are based on childrens anatomy because they didnt feel like bothering.

10365186,0,t1_dcio9yc,I have an idea about the Koroks. The Deku Tree is a guardian forest spririt like a demigod. We have no info before OOT of the Deku Tree and not after in other timelines we have remnants like the first dungeon in TP and level  in Zelda . We do though have guardians that take over such as Faron the Dragon in SS yes a water dragon but shes protecting the forest and Faron the light spirit in TP. There are other guardian spirits like Lord JabuJabu who the Zora serve in OOT who is called Jabun in WW who is guardian of the fish men. Point is the guardian spirits of the land change their forms in every age. There are usually a race that they look out for who in turn serve and protect the guardian. We have seen in the past that when the world changes so can the race that serves under a guardian to help it survive. So the Koroks when they were the Kokiri they were more conspicuous and would have the same weakness of any human with regards to mobility and possibly defense. In OOT they are told by the Deku Tree they would die if they left the forest and when the monsters came they could do nothing but hide. In a world gone to ruin if Kokiri forest was destroyed they would be extremely vulnerable and in their childlike form they could not effectively protect and serve the Deku Tree. Also it seems to me one of the main concerns of the KokiriKoroks is for the forest to thrive and for the Deku Tree to survive. in WW we see them actively spreading seeds around the islands. What if that was a need in BOTW? Sure there are certainly trees but the Deku Tree itself is huge and old and if old forests were being destroyed then its life would be in danger.  Perhaps thats why we are seeing Koroks again because despite how wild the land looks only  years ago it was blasted. Nature bounces back pretty quickly but it can take thousands of years for an old growth forest to form. To your other point yeah the destroyed castle town is the only thing that has me questioning a pre LttP timeline. The plateau and the old temple of time makes sense after all that and the OOT castle was destroyed in the game so makes sense it was abandoned and a new castle was built. The events after OOT to the Imprisioning war doesnt leave a lot of time for castle building especially when theres all kinds of destruction going on. If BOTW takes place during or after the Imprisioning War could still be the OOT link if he is defeated and survived I still dont see how a new castle could have been built... I just remind myself this story is one that is still in the process of being written and the game creators can change and modify their history if they need to. Theres no proof that what people in Hyrule write down about their history is actually fact anyway it seems to be more of a legend... sorry.,zelda,dciyf8k,2,t5_2r61g

10404462,0,t1_dcncfd5,I dont know where youre getting these statistics from but have you seen the increase in games with female lead playable characters lately? I can list several iconic female lead characters in critically acclaimed games. Samus Lara Croft Shantae Princess Peach playable in several Mario spinoffs but a lead character in her own game Joanna Dark Jade from Beyond Good and Evil Chell from Portal which arguably has two female main characters if you include its villain several Japanese roelplaying games and the list goes on. And that doesnt even include the games that are coming out in the future like a game that personally crowdfunded called Indivisible which I personally crowdfunded and it features a main character who is female and ethnically diverse as well as a plethora of characters of different sexes and backgrounds. The point Im trying to make is that Link doesnt need to be female because the real solution is finding great female characters in other great games! Women dont need to feel they can only be validated for playing videogames by making Link a woman.gt  if there were literally no games with female protagonists do you think that females would be less likely to play games?I see what youre trying to say but youre missing the point of what Im saying. We clearly dont live in a vacuum like that we havent ever since Samus took off her power suit.,zelda,dcnevi9,1,t5_2r61g

10407304,0,t1_dcn92u4, would be a full priced game.  Games that are not AAA do come out at that price.  And most remakesports.  Also my point with the PSP is the handheld thats a console is nothing new since the guy was acting like it was some new ingenious idea.  So I used the PSP and Vita as examples.  Things have changed though too.  While the PSP was a nice idea for its time over  years ago the Vita has sold even worse than the Wii U.  People arent really wanting to pay full price for a weaker hybrid anymore.  Price range shouldve probably been  with a game included.  Most likely their  Switch.  The console itself shouldnt cost anymore than  to produce on the high end.  Im estimating it would be even less but impossible to say without a hardware breakdown and we still dont even know everything thats in it.  And the docks and stuff theyre charging almost  for are nothing special.  You could do the same thing with a USBC and HDMI.  Neither of which cost more than  to a consumer.,zelda,dcnqhtr,1,t5_2r61g

So when I got to the Sky Keep SS and could literally touch and obtain it... yeahhhh. It kind of ruined it for me. I dont know.

10677405,0,t1_ddha3vd,Hey fair enough thats an awesome explanation! After posting this I did a lot more thinking and it seems like throughout the series the Golden Goddesses kind of just sat back and let whatever happen happen after they created everything. So I can accept that pretty easily. However when we finally have a powerful companion along side us such as Midna I still cant get over her mostly uselessness. Fi Navi Tatl etc they didnt do much but they also never received ancient Twili magic so they are excused from that. ,zelda,ddhal20,1,t5_2r61g

10735105,0,t3_5tjx23,What bugged me about this video is that he made a lot of already popular and well known theories and banks of information seem like no one has ever heard it before like a mind blown effect. The fact that the interlopers and the creators of the majoras mask were the same tribe.... for example....And how its such a shocker than OoT link is the hero of shade didnt see that coming?I was already under the impression that lorule and termina could be the same place simply based on their lack of triforce and gods and how many people had counterparts...

10746118,0,t3_5tpr6b,The Water Temple is confusing because of the constant raising and lowering of the water level and the many small keys you need. Its easy to forget where you are in the process and you find out that you actually need to change the water level because its at the wrong height for the thing youre trying to do or you find out you need a small key and you have to backtrack and dig around to find the one you missed.Its easy to forget a small key and its easy to forget what youve done and what needs to be done especially because the temple is very large especially vertically.Certainly the constant pausing to use the Iron Boots didnt help but that was honestly the least of the temples problems.,zelda,ddodpby,3,t5_2r61g

10761219,0,t3_5ty7n9,I personally like the game. It has a really unorthodox story while still giving me thwt nostalgia Zelda feeling. Also the relationship between Link and Zelda was done so well that alone is an upside to the game. The big downside is the control scheme. It makes fighting bosses much harder than it should be and fails to integrate it in a clever way.,zelda,ddpxuz0,2,t5_2r61g
10765792,0,t1_ddqeou9,Right but I think their point is this Im just providing counter arguments. Once you leave the plateau and by the summer most of us will have leveled up Links with all of the stuff we need to traverse the overworld. Those bonus chests might not have much worth to us at that point thats why I think they are offering them up front. ,zelda,ddqetwn,3,t5_2r61g
10765837,0,t3_5u0nos,My votes are for Wind Waker Majoras Mask and either Ocarina of Time or A Link Between Worlds. The first two are probably my personal favorites in the franchise and OoT and LbW are a good way to get a taste of real classic Zelda or in LbW an excellent modernized take on classic Zelda.Have fun!,zelda,ddqezx8,4,t5_2r61g

How ever did we survive playing any of the previous Zelda games without any addons? Oh because theyre really good games and didnt need any multiple packs added on.The reason the industry has a shitty rep when it comes to all this DLC business is because people lap it up and complain while paying for it anyhow  so we keep getting misc garbage addon packs that shouldnt even have to exist. Consumers then try to convince themselves its worthwhile when in reality if no one paid for it wed be getting it anyhow because if they excluded it the game would suffer and sales wouldnt be as great.You would be getting all of that content by default but we are trying to convince ourselves otherwise to feel better about spending  more on top of the base price.,zelda,ddqlsk8,4,t5_2r61g

The final boss where you take the immensive stairs towards the room where Ganon is. The music and the stairs which took so long to climb really made me so nervous and exciting for the final battle..

Ocarina of TimeI think the worst part of ranking OoT so low is that I know it looks like Im just one of those hipsters who find OoT cool to hate and cant think for themselves. I do think its a damn good game and maybe a lot of the problem comes from expectations set too high but I just didnt have fun in it like I did in the others and Im not even wholey sure why. Parts like leaving Saria before you first visit Hyrule castle then go to the Gorons only to have to go right back to Saria and back to the Gorons... Its half an hour of boring walking and cutscenes and for a game hyped up to me as the best of all time stuff like that seems like a very distracting oversight.,zelda,de8iu44,1,t5_2r61g

10955853,0,t1_dea05ok,Did it bother you at all that when you played A Link to the Past that the story it told didnt match that?

But A Link to the Past says that Ganon wished on the Triforce when he found it in the Sacred Realm he wished to transform the Sacred Realm into the Dark World he couldnt find his way out of the realm and the sages only sealed the realm once when evil from Ganons wish began to pour out into the Light World.

11028536,0,t3_5xhc6z,One way they can retcon the idea of it being the unification of all the timelines or at least making reference to other games in different timelines is that the Hylians in this game are very aware and serious about prophecy.. so it could be that they had Seers or someone who could see the possibility of other timelines which is why so many other events are mentioned in the game.Though from that quote from Zelda specifically only the Child timeline where the sacred realm is protected makes sense. While Link never took the Master Sword at least not until he was old enough to they might still refer to him as the Hero of Time despite not technically doing anything but warning Zelda and the King at the end of OoT.,zelda,dei25i3,1,t5_2r61g

11029889,0,t1_dei4wrf,The only thing we know is the game uses Double Buffered Vsync meaning if the FPS drops below the target at all it will instantly dip to fps until the GPU catches up with the refresh rate again and a lot of the time this happens because the systems have trouble when streaming new information like texturesfoliage. If Nintendo removed Vsync it could clear up the fps lock when frames get low but visually that wouldnt be pleasing because then wed get screen tearing. The only thing Im hoping for is Nintendo are looking at how they can make texture streaming more smooth on both console. Still completely baffles me that this game was originally designed with the Wii Us hardware in mind and  years later they bug tested the game so well but none of the QA team ever said Yo this frame rate is the worst you need to fix this It gets so bad in villages especially.,zelda,dei7o7w,1,t5_2r61g

11031547,0,t3_5xhs5y,Im playing on Wii U and about ten hours in heres my list of negatives no spoilers The layout of buttons is slightly awkward specifically the placement of dashing and jumping.  Im not a huge fan of the degrading weapons system. I do like the element of terror it brings to battles but its resulted in me losing a lot of cool weapons.  It grinds my gears that theres no gamepad functionality specifically for managing the inventory system.  Speaking of which the Inventory system is a little clunky. Thats about it. The frame rate doesnt bother me at all Ive run around Kakariko Village while its raining Ive gotten into heated battles with tons of enemies onscreen and while its noticeable it isnt detrimental to my experience. Overall its a tremendously detailed and amazing game and it may very well be the best Zelda ever to date. Contrary to the hype its not perfect nothing is. But its goddamn lovely. Majoras Mask will always have a special place in my heart but this may have dethroned it.  out of  broken swords for me! ,zelda,deiefn7,3,t5_2r61g

As we dont see any evidence of other villians like vaati bellamu etc. in the game the evil in hyrule is vanqished After ganon is defeated. And lastly i think the dragon break took place before the shieka built the beasts. Maybe at some point the soul  of ganon from all timelines decided to merge into one explaining why ganon here is not the demon King etc. But his whole wraith the entire calamaty demise set up in ss. And with the World exposed to nature its the perfect time to start new without any evil or corrupted time.,zelda,del9w50,2,t5_2r61g

Its not that Oh you got hit by a boulder. You lost  of  hearts! stuff that even childs can easily do. The game is now much more challenging and you have to think before attacking an army of bokoblins and you have to learn their moveset and how to parry. As a Dark souls fan this is really great because now i really feel great if i slay a big enemy. And if you have good enough armor  bonus hearts you wonT get oneshotted.,zelda,dem6bip,1,t5_2r61g

11066260,0,t1_dem9y3e,im sorry but thats just not going to be possible. weapons break way too frequently in this game as a purposeful survival mechanic. your  weapon will break pretty much every other monster encounter and youre going to be left in the middle of a group of  monsters with no weapons nearby quite often. Just to give you a better idea for a challenge that seems reasonable no slot upgrades. youre stuck with the default number of weaponbowshield slots this means youll have that same sense of limited resources that youre looking for but you wont make the game literally impossible. ,zelda,demcm4s,6,t5_2r61g

11106700,0,t3_5yedkg,Zelda is truly one of the most consistently good franchises ever. Almost every game gets critical acclaim on release even the controversial ones like Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess. For my personal top  list...its hard to make one especially since I havent played enough of BotW to place it somewhere properly. for me top  is easily MM OOT then WW. Then probably something like links Awakening Oracle of Ages and Skyward Sword. BotW so far would probably rank around SKyward Sword and Oracle of Ages right now but depending on how I feel as I progress the game it could go up or down,zelda,deqxo06,1,t5_2r61g

Also Aonuma said that the best game to play in preparation of BotW is TP.It is also mentioned in game that Ganon has given up on reincarnation to assume a form of pure malice or something like thatspoiler which implies that this is the last Ganon to exist in the timelinespoiler. Combine that with the futuristic shiekah technology not present in any other game and its looking to me like its the most recent.

11125326,0,t3_5yr95w,fps should really be the standard for the industry. Look at Platinum games on your wii u. Although that doesnt mean that Botw isnt a solid . The truth is that a lot of emulators out there improve the games. Take for example Dolphin that can upscale add filters and run with the help of some mods  Mario Sunshine at  fps. PCMR although i am a proud member  tends to be circlejerking at times. So if you are really interested in why these claims are made search on youtube about Dolphin and how it can uplift Mario Sunshine. Twillight Princess Custom Shaders and Textures and so on. These claims are true to begin with the way they are expressed is the problem here.

Having a game thats already upwards of ish hours long just out of sheer exploration requires there to be moments where you just leave the strenuous tedious puzzlesolving aspect out. While I very much enjoyed sitting down for a couple of hours getting through a single dungeon Id probably despise it in this game. Theres such a vast world out there that being cooped up in a dungeon for even an hour or so would feel suffocating. I like that its a quick in and out and the stories revolving around the Divine Beasts the Zora arc in particular make the dungeons seem less of a chore and more of a necessity. I love how they did them but Im not opposed to the other style either. I think each works to the games benefit. ,zelda,dexg3z1,31,t5_2r61g

11170682,0,t3_5zhh19,Personally no Im excited for what they can build on it for future entries but for me its not as great as Wind Waker Twilight Princess or A Link to the Past. I love the open world and with some changes it could be the best but heres a few of the reasons I like the others betterthe story is one of the weakest in the series. There are very little emotionally charged moments on the game besides from a few of the memories. Nothing that came even close to the final Wind Waker fight taking Midina to princess Zelda Fi leaving the sword saving grandma in Wind Waker confronting skull kid. The champions and the fighters were weakly fleshed out and had very little emotional connection to Link  The dungeons were brutal for such a massive game. For a game that wanted you to spend over  hours in its world the dungeons were easy incredibly short and inexplicably had literally one enemy in them before the boss. The bosses were also quite easy using Stasis and especially if you had bomb arrows. I understand why they didnt have music playing all the time but I still really really missed classic Zelda themes and overtures. Enemy variety was incredibly weak. No Redeads Darknuts or Armos. Guardians basically the only new enemy. Basically every enemy in the game could be found  minutes from the great plateau. Everything else was just elemental differences. it was repetitive. About  hours into the game I wasnt even excited to discover the last  areas. I knew I would just find the same enemies shrines korok seeds.  Im not one of the people that hated the voice acting but it could have been better. It was very awkward at times with Link not saying anything. This is just my opinion and I understand why some people might think this is the best. Im still really enjoying it and it does a lot of awesome things I hope they build on. But its not even in my top  Zelda games. ,zelda,dey6nzr,5,t5_2r61g

11174443,0,t3_5zioyh,I actually found a lot of the late game kinda disappointing. There really wasnt anything in the castle that could threaten my  hearts and endless pockets of steak. I started to miss the beginning of the game where everything was a life or death situation.On the topic of Ganon I thought his first form was nicely designed. Would have been a really scary fight if he could actually do any damage. I was really disappointed with how the champions chipped in though. Just a quick cutscene and half of Ganons health is gone. I was hoping theyd be a bit more involved. Like maybe Ganon would have a super powerful attack that Rudania would interrupt with a bomb giving Link an opening? Just something other than one simple laser attack.For the ending after reading their diaries I was hoping the king would meet with Zelda one last time and apologize. And maybe the champions could say goodbye to Link? I mean after waiting  years whats in the afterlife that you guys are in such a hurry to get to?

I really like how solemn and serious she can sound and yet in one of the memories specifically when she is talking to link about the flowers and whatnot her tone changes and she speaks with such enthusiasm and excitement. In the other games aside from SS which I have not played Zelda seemed very much like the generic princess character more a symbol than a person with emotions. In this game I find myself actually caring about her.

Do you mean like the controller to TV range? or do you mean the carry range and still being able to play the game on the screen because I am not sure if you know but the switch can be played anywhere! Think of the wii gamepad but instead the wii gamepad had the entire console inside of it! The only time you dock it is to charge it or if you want to play it on your TV! Its very simple to use and I love it very much I get a few hours use playing BOTW in portable mode and even then the charger is pretty portable too! USB C.So technically the range is pretty infinite within reason compared to the Wii U.,zelda,df2pzi7,1,t5_2r61g
11211909,0,t1_df2uk0u,I got stuck for multiple days probably nearly  hours. I was determined not to use a guide but eventually gave in.Funny enough I made it into the room I was supposed to go to but I didnt know there was a metal door that needed magnesis. Since it had a treasure chest in the room I assumed it was just a random treasure room.My complaints on this section arepoor layout hard to see enemies too close together short barriers to hide behindunforgiving one detect and you get slaughteredunreliable detection sometimes bananas are ignored or the wrong enemy goes to it causing even more troublepoor room design the room with the treasure chest looks like a simple treasure room. why hide the door tooI went into this thinking I needed a key to free a prisoner. Not thinking I needed to find a hidden door to fight a boss.Another complaint is the massive trigger fight for getting caught is so absurd and unnecessary. Just blow a whistle and make me reappear outside. Why even give me a choice to fight that losing battle? If youre strong enough great! If not you either run outside wasting time or your have to reload your game wasting time.The only positive was the master kohga boss fight is a classic Zelda boss fight and much better than the blight ganon boss battles.,zelda,df2uv3l,1,t5_2r61g

11226343,0,t3_6095di,If were going off the speculation that this takes place in the Child timeline then we need to remember that the last time Ganon was seen he was sealed within the Four Sword NOT the Master Sword as Four Swords Adventures takes place last to our knowledge within that timeline. In that case maybe our best course of action is to search for evidence and information referencing the Four Sword or Vaati or something else from Four Swords Adventures for example I feel like the map from FSA has at the very least a similar layout to what we see in Breath of the Wild the desert is in the same place with a snowy region to its east followed by grasslands and forests Hyrule Castle is central to the area with large volcanic mountains to the north and watery regions to the castles east the area northwest of the castle could easily over time have changed in to what we now see as Hebra of course all of this could be totally irrelevant or simply not as referenced as the map for Twilight Princess which I have not yet gone over. Plus theres the obvious evidence of Zeldas mention of twilight during Memory  as well as the existence of the Arbiters Grounds within Gerudo Desert.If we go off of speculation for the Adult timeline we do have the existence of RitoKoroks plus the description from the rock salt material. However Ive also been told theres some kind of carvingmural within Castle Town in Twilight Princess HD which alludes to the Rito so maybe the evidence for Adult timeline isnt as concrete as we thought.If we go off of the Downfall timeline we have the obvious thematic similarities to exploration and discovery as well as various names and locations that soundlook similar to locations from Zelda . Of course these could all simply be that thematic or referential in nature only. That and the fact that the names of the OoT sages would not exclusively be known in this timeline make it hard to place without more information.To address the first link you posted... how does that confirm hes a descendant of any previous Link? All Links are at least spiritually related through resurrection or something similar as discovered in Skyward Sword I believe but theres little evidence to suggest our BotW Link is related by blood to any previous hero. His father being a knight within Hyrule Castle is the only clue there but its also a very light link at best.Ultimately... I just dont know if we have enough concrete evidence or interpretations to fully decide without large contradictions. Currently if one timeline is to be picked the Child timeline offers the most concrete option considering Zelda again specifically speaks of twilight. But even then its just not easy to place without errors. And hell most of the larger references Im finding are to Skyward Sword or Ocarina of Time so thats hardly helpful in this case.,zelda,df4hpjt,2,t5_2r61g

Obviously some games are direct sequels and have references to the other games Ocarina of Time gt Wind Waker but many of them clearly were made to not fit into canon Four Swords Adventures. Nintendo just made a timeline because fans demanded it.At this point I just consider it a story that occurs after Ocarina of Time. We know for sure Ocarina of Time occurred. Thats about it. I feel like Nintendo told the very first Zelda story with Skyward Sword and Breath of the Wild is the very last Zelda story. ,zelda,df4tv17,4,t5_2r61g

11240356,0,t3_60ddkk,agreed. hebra is already pretty fantastic but a lack of anybody makes it feel a little lacking. at least seeing other hikers or something around the snowboarding place or just on the trails would make it feel a little more alive not that it needs to feel much more alive  its a fricken cold harsh environment  it just could use a little more at least near the minigame cabins.faron jungle is ALMOST great but if it had a little more depth it would totally blow me away. maybe some sort of hint of where the ruins come from or a bit more with them. theres a surprising lack of emphasis on any the ruins outside of the shrine of courage which is a spinoff of the main quest so its not particularly tied with the areas unique story. gerudo highlands are cool in that they are more of a lategame area than any other. its hard to climb up there and its super cold so its almost completely unthinkable until link is pretty strong. but then there also doesnt feel like theres much reason to be there? there is absolutely NO ONE here and not all that much treasureshrinesanything but enemies that you find in other places. maybe it wouldnt stand out so much if it werent for being parallel to the totally amazing gerudo desert to the south.and of course id LOVE for there to be region specific music and bosses to match these extreme environments. seriously though why do only the gerudo desert and death mountain have unique music? hebra and faron for sure deserve something as the other two most extreme regions of the map. ,zelda,df62tig,1,t5_2r61g

The joycons have the buttons right above or below the joysticks so its a bit more cumbersome. This saves on space though so for mobile gaming I see why they did it.,zelda,df9lybm,1,t5_2r61g
11272059,0,t3_60vo3b,Personally I like Wind Waker better but I can see why people prefer BoTW. I think a big reason why Wind Waker is my all time favourite game is because I love all the things that everyone loves but the things that annoy people I actually enjoy. I love the sailing. Even in the original before the fast sail I enjoyed every minute of sailing. I love the art style. Heck I even didnt mind the triforce hunt. To me Wind Waker has the best of everything Zelda. Fantastic exploration you never knew what you were going to find on that next island what the challenge would be awesome dungeons and items one of the best stories and awesome characters Tetra King of Red Lions Makar Medli Grandma etc. ,zelda,df9o6ja,8,t5_2r61g

11425180,0,t3_6335iq,If you look at politics Spirit Tracks evidently had a parliamentarian government system. Terminas a different universe but Clock Town seemed to be outright republican. The average tech seems to vary a lot ranging from dark age to th century levels which gels with the variety of government types weve seen. Even then Hyrule seems to act as a federation of sorts uniting the political systems of Zora Gorons and so on. With the addition of magic quality of life might vary as much as it did over  years of European life with very superficial changes in culture and art.Real life actually has an analogue that remained in stasis for about half as long assuming SS was around the  year thing since the robots in SS existed for a while already its plausible  Egypt. Egyptian art was remarkably conservative changing relatively little in style or idiom over  years of history. They maintained certain states of their language as long or longer than Europeans maintained Latin as a lingua franca. Their technology was relatively sophisticated with some gradual developments here or there but kind of stagnated like China did recently. Egypt owes a lot of its conservative features to the relationship of the priesthood and the godking Zelda of course is a GoddessQueen supported by the sages. I mean Egypt really didnt see  change and at times power shifted between the pharaoh and the priesthood but it was still remarkably conservative.So maybe its not quite as weird as it seems at first glance? Hyrule just has the advantage of being surrounded by oceans and canyons that make it really hard for outside cultures to come in and conquer everything and remake it in their image. Much like how Egypt itself mostly only had to worry about Nubians and the occasional threat from Sinai until the Greeks got powerful. ,zelda,dfr16pz,22,t5_2r61g

The tutorial teaches you to chop trees but it also teaches you that there will be tutorials along your path and there arent. Seeing the old man again makes it feel like you are going the right way but then you are on your own.And yes in this game you are often on your own.

The former is just because I think it would make everything very interesting aesthetically really. I would love s Castle Town and Ganondorf in a suit.

They felt more like extended shrines than actual zelda dungeons.,zelda,dfyoc3l,1,t5_2r61g
11493279,0,t1_dfyr8un,I think the reason this didnt happen was because they wanted to break free of all conventions and returning to the hero of time might have seemed like overkill to some people. A lot of fans wanted to see the series let go of Ocarina as much as they loved it. I get it. Wind Waker and TP both great games but both used the OoT story as their foundation. BotW seems to be replacing that. I could see the next several games referring to the hero of the Wild in the same way other games mentioned the hero of time with such reverence. ,zelda,dfyrg56,3,t5_2r61g

11503514,0,t3_645lpb,I definitely agree linear games allow for more developed progression whereas open world games need to account for being completed out of order and as a result things like the difficulty scaling and item progression suffer.For a future game I hope they maybe make the world a tad smaller while also making it more dense with more towns and the like and also add some linearity to it.One of the things I sorely missed in Breath of the Wild was the key items Hookshot Iron boots etc. Once I realised about halfway through the game that these key items were just no in the game at all it took all the surprise an excitement out of things like shrines because I knew that at the end of every single one would be a random sword and a shadow orb. Its honestly weird to me as well because I feel as though items like the Hookshot and the Iron boots could have been in the game but also could have been completely optional and gated by maybe extra large mini dungeonlike shrines? And what I mean by optional is they would not be required by any means to complete the game they would have just been neat extras to help you out. As an example you could equip the Iron Boots to get things underwater as you would expect I killed a Silver Lizalfos in the water yesterday and the gems he dropped sank beneath the water but only just out of reach which was annoying hookshot for climbing easier etc. ,zelda,dfzx9cq,1,t5_2r61g

Like someone else said in water it gives off an AoE blast of sorts and all the fish just float up to the top for easy pickins.   Might seem wasteful to some but every blood moon you can get a shit ton of electric arrows from that one lynel on top of the zora domain area and hes the weakest kind of lynel too so its good for regular practice.

11739723,0,t1_dgqpc63,Thats totally fair and like I said BOTW is a good game I personally enjoyed my time with it more than fallout and the witcher. But if the argument is that the world in BOTW is as populated w things to do and as densely filled with points of interestnpcsquests as those games I mentioned then I just cant get behind that. Having played all the games mentioned for many hours thats just objectively false and I see it get parroted a lot in the Nintendo centric subs which makes me think that maybe there are more people out there who havent played those games than I thought. I guess if you have been a Nintendo stan the past five or so years youve really missed out on the leaps that have been made w open world titles specifically ones of this nature. Again BOTW is awesome but it is by no means pushing the boundaries of what games can do or doing anything its contemporaries havent been doing for years already. Other than the climbing mechanic which I just personally dont see as being that revolutionary despite people acting like its the greatest thing since games moved to d. ,zelda,dgqq78l,2,t5_2r61g

11744560,0,t1_dgls3hg,If Im being honest I thought I was pretty fair overall...Although I will admit I couldve probably worded myself better in some regards.When I was comparing Wind Waker to this game I was mainly talking about story I just feel older Zelda games like Wind Waker or Majoras Mask were more memorable in that area because of their linearity. And since BoTW takes a more nonlinear approach I found myself accidentally skipping a lot of important quests.I did go back and get the rest of Links memories and while the ending cutscene was better than what I had originally gotten I still felt like I didnt get any closure from it.I dont see any of the Zelda games or just any game for that matter as perfect that includes Wind Waker. And yeah I can definitely apply what I said about the overworld in BoTW even moreso in Wind Waker. And what you said about Wind Waker are definitely valid complaints.While I do see Wind Waker as one of the easier Zelda games when it comes to combat its still in the zone of familiarity for me Fast paced swordplay. Whereas in BoTW I feel like I was just chugging away at every enemy that wasnt a Bokoblin Stalfos or Keese and then my weapon would break so Id have to run away a small distance so I could equip another weapon that I wasnt saving for the Calamity Ganon battle which was pretty much all of them and then Id chug away at that enemy again until they either killed me which happened way too often or they finally decided to keel over and die rinse repeat. It just felt very slow and frustrating for me to the point where I would just run past enemies and not bother to fight them. And again with the Parrying and Dodging I found that even if I timed it correctly I would still get hit or my shield would break or it wouldnt prompt me to flurry rush an enemy. Personally I feel like BoTW couldve benefited from a combat style like Twilight Princess its the fast paced swordplay that were familiar with but you also learn more combat skills as you progress through the story. From this whole thread I feel like a lot of people just read its no wind waker and just completely disregarded the rest of what I had to say.I loved exploring the new Hyrule.I loved the cutscenes.I loved the voice acting.I loved the art style.I loved freeing the divine beasts.I loved the Calamity Ganon fight.Really the only things I didnt like about this game were things that were either drastically different from other D Zelda titles like the controls the difficulty the combat and the nonlinear story or things that I just simply didnt enjoy like the beginning and end of the story Midstory was great tho The Lightning strike mechanic or Ganons second form.I went into this game expecting a traditional D Zelda Which I now realise was a bit of a mistake I didnt get what I was expecting and was disappointed. Again its not a bad game. I just didnt enjoy it as much as others did.,zelda,dgr9xnb,1,t5_2r61g

Therefore they are usually gonna have a Zelda a link a ganon of some kind and a fucking castle. But apparently that resembles ocarina too much? Also wind waker was a brilliant game alot of peiple get on the train of hate because it had a cartoon style which is annoying.
