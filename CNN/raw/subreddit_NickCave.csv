2247217,0,t3_2ji0w1,I just flipped over to side two of From Her to Eternity and it sounds absolutely amazing. The cover is nice the record is flawless and it sounds unbelievable. If youve got a decent vinyl set up or know someone who does pick it up.         Shit PM me if you live near Philadelphia and Ill play my copy for you.    ,NickCave,clph2yg,1,t5_2tpyl

2497253,0,t1_cmjwows,I think the Miley Cyrus lyric is one of the most brilliant lines on the album. Saying that she floats in a swimming pool suggests an ambiguous ending  shes either drowned signifying a happy ending as the supreme symbol of everything wrong with society is no more or shes sitting on an inflatable mattress the opposite ending. Although he song takes place in the future that one detail could swing either way and affects the whole image.However I do find the lyric a strange choice as Miley didnt gain real notoriety until a few months after the albums release with We Cant Stop. Cave is clearly referring to her as she appears in Hannah Montana. Although the meaning isnt that different either way the lyric holds more impact now. Quite the luck there.,NickCave,cmkj2a3,4,t5_2tpyl

Besides the girl in the first one is already spinning Girl in amber trapped forever spinning down the hall but in the second stanza And now in turn you turn... Susie. And now in turn my head is spinning. Your interpretation is also beautiful maybe mine is too forced! ,NickCave,d9yojzk,1,t5_2tpyl
10408420,0,t3_5p209p,It kinda depends what you mean by slow and dark The Boatmans Call and No More Shall we part are both mostly sad or mournful pianobased songs but dont have the richer more mysterious soundscapes of Push the Sky Away or Skeleton Tree. Your Funeral... My Trial is a  much earlier album thats very brooding and intense but pretty subdued for him in that period. But even then its hard to say that the mood is really that similar to his two most recent albums considering how different Nicks singing style and the production of the album is.Or you could try Murder Ballads which I think is a great introduction to his more narrativedriven songs and showcases a lot of his strengths one after the other.,NickCave,dcnv1st,11,t5_2tpyl
