10604347,0,t1_dd6vgjn,gt If it were me I would rather people use masculine pronouns  name because really thats who I was all along. Deadname was just a role I had to play to survive for a while.Im always really glad to find other people who feel this way. Especially because I have a few family members I still have to play the role with not in person thank fuck but over the phone or by mail or etc...Like its not a coincidence that I didnt come out to anyone with any real sway over my life until I was out of college financially independent and had a bit of savings. I grew up in the deep South and probably would have been skewered alive if Id come out to certain people any earlier. Almost certainly never would have made it out of poverty.And its definitely not a coincidence I always felt like I was wearing a mask for other peoples benefit  even if I couldnt consciously think why until later.,FTMOver30,dd9ra9p,4,t5_3ibyi
11362574,0,t3_622dp2,Mans fashion can get really boring I feel you. What I try to do is go for interesting fabrics so that a simple tshirt and pants look becomes a bit more sophisticated. Also I think cos has really nice options that come off luxurious and fancy but still modern and not too buttoned up. ,FTMOver30,dfjxcw8,2,t5_3ibyi
11380563,0,t1_dfltbj4,I relate to so much of what you wrote. I even remember longing to be able to be a dad despite the fact that I didnt want to bear children or be a mother. There were so many clues I just didnt read enough into them. I thought women who liked feminine things like makeup and shaving were brainwashed amd hated female business attire especially. But I never imagined myself in a suit instead. I never imagined myself as a man at all. Id hate my circumstances as a woman and then go right into feminist analysis of why they sucked and what could be done to oppose it or negotiate it from a feminist perspective. I never really asked myself what i would rather have on a personal level. I think thats one of the main reasons it took me so long. And I chalk it up directly to what is called female socialization which can include putting the greater good over your own personal needs. I came from that headspace so deeply that I didnt even know what my needs and desires were. It took the dramatic end of a fiveyear relationship during which Id served the relationship above myself and tried to be the perfect girlfriend with the perfect helpingothers nonprofit career before I got selfish enough to actually identify what I truly felt and desired. And then it all came to the surface. ,FTMOver30,dflyug9,2,t5_3ibyi
