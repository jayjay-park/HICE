522985,0,t1_cfzoyhk,I would not say Germans are overpowered. I think both armies certainly have their strong suits but Id say that the best strategies revolve more around a progressive solidify and adapt playstyle for the Germans whereas the Soviets have a few very effective allin preplanned strategies in the current meta.What I would say is that the Germans are more familiar. Their progression throughout the game is very reminiscent of the Wehrmacht in the original Company of Heroes and it is likely that many fans of the older game would naturally gravitate towards what feels comfortable.That said there will always be a level of German fanboyism. A lot of people just find the German units and aesthetics cooler and for some people it may extend to ideology Youll know the types when you see their names.Also you can play mirror matches but it has to be in a Custom Game.

Coh s multiplayer is relatively active and honestly pretty good. Although you dont like the Russians the Germans are a very fleshed out faction in it and are good fun. For campaigns though Coh  takes the cake.  very good campaigns and more with the rd DLC which i never bought so i cant comment on it. It is also focused on the BritishAmericans so if that is more to your taste id recommend it.

639880,1,t1_cgczy19,Sorry I mean T as in it doesnt require teching to build. I see you point but if the enemy is dumping bunkers all over then he is bleeding his manpower. If its only one bunker and that causes you to lose the game then there is another issue at play. You can still counter with pgrenpgren or pgrenscripts if you spread the two squads out enough for one to eat the suppression. Forcing your opponent to play one way is an integral part of the game. Just because you cant charge into a bunker with a carpgren isnt the bunker useless then? without any risk or thought doesnt mean its not balanced anymore.

843093,0,t1_ch04089,Vehicle ModificationsA number of modifications were made to medium and heavy vehicles to better align the units relative to one another. German vehicle penetration tended to be fairly high resulting in a devaluation of Soviet armor values. These changes also seek to solidify unit roles and remove any ineffective units from the game.AOE Profiles    Very similar to the changes made to grenade AOE profiles. Long and midrange AOE no longer has a chance to miss its target the weapon profile damage has been averaged out to compensate. Slight adjustments to AOE radius or distance values were made on a number of vehicles to better align them with their intended performance.Mobility    The goal was to better distinguish light medium and heavy vehicles from one another. By increasing the applicable speed range we can better define light vehicle mobility relative to heavier units. Vehicle acceleration has also been adjusted to accomplish this goal.        Increased max speed by . tuned rotation to ensure smooth pathing        Negative cover from .x to .x max speed vehicles move faster on roads        Adjusted vehicle terrain performance based on type. For example vehicles with tracks can move through heavy and light cover easier than wheeled vehicles.        Acceleration is now properly functioning within the game previously vehicles incorrectly used deceleration to define the rate at which they accelerated resulting in near instant max speed.Vehicle Penetration    Vehicle penetration is now based on distance to target. High velocity weapons have a lower drop off than low velocity. High explosive weapons do not drop off over distance.Vehicle Criticals    Engine damage criticals will only occur on the front or rear armor of a vehicle depending on engine position. For example a Panzer IV no longer receives an engine critical if hit from the front. However this does not impact weapons like the AT grenade which force criticals. Main gun destroyed criticals function in a similar manner a SU can no longer gain a main gun destroyed from a rear penetrating shot.    Rear armor hits now display a kicker to indicate to the player that the enemy tank has been exposed similar to Company of Heroes. Scout Car    The armor reduction increases the vulnerability of the Scout Car to small arms fire increasing the overall risk associated with its use vs. these targets. The fuel increase furthers the risk to the players tech progression and overall use of this unit en masse.        Armor from  to         Manpower cost from  to         Fuel cost from  to Panzer IV    The Panzer IV will continue to dominate the T in the antiarmor role but will perform worse versus infantry. That said compared to the Panther the Panzer IV does perform better vs. soft targets including infantry and light vehicles.        Armor from  to         Rear armor from  to         Reload from . to ..Ostwind    Relative to the Panzer IV the Ostwind performs extremely well vs. soft targets but is vulnerable to other medium vehicles.

Recharge time from  to Tiger    Heavy armor saw an increase in performance to better highlight its tech placement. When a player transitions from light to medium armor there is a very clear differentiation in the power of medium vehicles vs. light. This change better highlights the transition from medium to heavy while still retaining the role of medium vehicles in the late game. Lower rear armor maintains the value of flanking while increased combat potential better addresses the tech level of the vehicle. Additionally the new AOE profile on the Tiger has significantly increased its antiinfantry performance.        Rear armor from  to         Penetration from  to         Reload from  to ..

The added penetration on the top gunner will increase the performance of this unit vs. other lightly armored units such as the  Scout Car or  Halftrack. Additionally we wanted to increase the impact of fielding light vehicles on the players tech progression.        Penetration on front gunner from  to ...        Health from  to         Manpower cost from  to         Fuel cost from  to M Halftrack    Penetration was added to both the  cal and Quad mounted gunner to bring this units performance in line with changes to other heavy weapons MG Maxim etc.        Penetration on front gunner from  to ...        Quad penetration from  to ...T    The T saw a number of changes to bring it in line with other light vehicles. The new AOE profiles improve the damage output of the T vs. infantry. Additionally its mobility was improved to better enable its recon role and offensive capacities. This unit functions as a very effective hit and run unit or on the flank.        Armor from  to         Manpower from  to         Reload from . to ..        Fuel from  to T    The goal was to improve the antiarmor capacity of the T to open up the number of viable strategies available to Soviets. We wanted to improve the appeal of the third building by reducing its dependence on additional antitank units. Relative to the Panzer IV the T will lose the majority of engagements unless it is able to capitalize on its superior mobility. However the T outperforms the Panzer IV against soft targets. The previously low armor of the T provided it very little protection against most German antitank sources the increase to  significantly changes this relationship.

1148671,0,t1_chyrny2,Sorry i mean CoH  as a whole aspiring to be better than its predecessor. See I bring up the M because that is the least realistically balanced unit in vCoH. Youre totally right the M is garbage when in reality it is functionally just an upgunned Sherman with an open top. Realism would have made the M infinity more usable because that was the way it was designed to function at the time. I point out the Ms speed because it was goofy not because it was op. About criticizing relic i think youre missing my complaint. There are no doubts in my mind that Relic will put plenty of effort into the Oberkommand to make them balanced and unique. Its just one thing the previous game lacked was realism as a foundation and what we got were Ms and that is something that CoH  could have to improve on the formula. And I find it upsetting to see any chance of that destroyed by the new factions when there are other things they could have done. If immersion is part of this game you can officially pronounce it dead when Oberkommand hits the field even though the game may still be just as good mechanically.

If they dont have a lot of AT then flamers in the back is good but I usually put zook riflemen in the back to do any light AT duty.  The arty call in is one of the best in the game IMO.

1454816,0,t1_ciymddj,I think it was a lot more even before the expansion although it averaged to being German biased which increased the more the player size increased. Then if there was a rather imbalanced patch it would skew towards that faction especially in v.Although Ive occasionally seen it about  in Allies favour its been pretty consistently Axis favoured about  when Ive been on even in v where the Allies are at their best. I get that the Germans are always popular in WW games but Im not sure why its so Axis favoured now. OKW are fun but so are the US. I was thinking before the expansion that the faction balance would become more even as the US would be more popular than Soviets. The only thing I can think of is the turtling playstyle which OKW can do quite well is really popular and have  rather aggressive factions on the same side doesnt help especially when one doesnt get heavy tanks.,CompanyOfHeroes,ciymx7r,1,t5_2rn3p

Remember that rifles are always going to perform better than assault weapons at longer ranges but its vastly more important that you shoot stationary from cover. Yellow cover halves accuracy green cover halves accuracy and damage. This means that yellow cover is  longrun DPS green is  longrun DPS.When youre moving you get  accuracy on rifles and  accuracy on StGs the Sturmpios weapon.

1551903,0,t1_cjaspiq,Sort of. I get youre frustrated with what Im typing but Im just trying to say that saying Enfield to pretty much the entire world sans the USA means the ubiquitous SMLE rifle. The M Enfield was based on the Pattern  rifle or Rifle . Pattern  which despite in the United States being referred to as the Pattern  Enfield was not manufactured by the Enfield plant and so while calling it an Enfield may be popular its really not an Enfield at all And the British didnt call it the Enfield. Its a Mauserbased design and is about as far removed from the LeeEnfield as possible.Yes it isnt far of a stretch to say the Americans might have a few Ms laying about to use but when the OP doesnt differentiate between the M and the SMLE its a bit confusing especially when he also mentioned the British Boys rifle which wasnt used by the Army but by the Marines in the Pacific.,CompanyOfHeroes,cjasz1s,1,t5_2rn3p

1569827,0,t1_cjcibix,I think you guys are drawing a few too many parallels between the SU and the Stug III. The  is on a  T chassis but mounts a dual purpose gun which you all know. That means that it isnt really in direct competition with the Stug a Panzer III chassis with the KwK . The design and purpose of the vehicles are so different that i think comparing there stats is a little beside the point. The SU is meant to be an infantry support weapon and with a few buffs i think it would preform well as one. The Stugs role is more a tank destroyer than a support weapon being supported rather than the supporter. It has more armored kills than any other German vehicle in the war for good reason. The reason it is worse than a tank is because it has no turret which makes firing while moving almost impossible severely limiting the guns assault abilities. It doesnt need to be limited by also having SU health and armor or something comparable. Its justified expense and one track use should be enough that it should be much better at a direct fire role head to head.,CompanyOfHeroes,cjd1uxp,1,t5_2rn3p

Its supposed to something youre constantly scraping by one battle away from losing a company.Here check out this thread. Notice that most players some of whom are top ranking only have a single company above .You should be good as long as nothing too badly so the best tip I can give you is that if you quit a map by exiting directly to windows without having saved in it youll restart the game back at the campaign map and be able to replay the mission without losing company strength.Finally dont worry too much about german retreats too the strongholds dont actually get more troops it just unlocks the next perk on their list.

3371857,0,t3_2ysslb,Stuarts suck unless you can rush one in the first ten minutes of the game. Bazookas also suck beyond the light armor phase. My current goto strategy as USF vs blobby OKW players is to use a three layered approachThe first layer is a screen of at least  BARFlamer riflemen or Paratroopersand maybe a Lieutenant or Captain. These guys provide sight and should be able to hold their own against shreck blobs. Use them to focus fire ObersFallschirmjgersSturmpioneers who pose the greatest threat to your own infantry. Spread your Rifles out to minimize losses from explosives and keep to cover or use defensive posture with the .The second layer is the true anti infantry champion of the USF the MA Scott motor carriage. You might supplement with a single Sherman with HE rounds but the MA is much better at dedicated antiinfantry. I usually have at least  of them which allows enough saturation fire to decimate most support weapons that might give you problems. Keep them far enough behind your riflemen to give supporting fire against blobs from safety. Use their barrage ability to wipe squads on retreat or to target antitank guns.The third and final layer is the AT layer. I prefer at least x Jacksons which will make short work of any German armor except for King Tigers and Panthers. However if you are in a pinch for fuel the mm AT gun is also an acceptable substitute. These guys should hang back behind the MAs and only hunt down tanks if you know you can score a kill.With this strategy only really viable in team games honestly you should be able to crush any blob while maintaining decent mobile antiarmor presence. Move up your retreat point as close as you dare and try not to retreat all at once. You need to be aggressive as possible as the USF. Once the motor carriages vet up they get very accurate and have reasonably long range. In order to field everything however you might have to abuse the USF decrewpurchase loophole to get around population cap limitations. However at this point I consider that an intentional feature of the USF rather than abusecheating especially considering how paper thin their armor is not to mention OKW blobbers deserve to be punished. ,CompanyOfHeroes,cpcm7bx,1,t5_2rn3p

3583758,0,t1_cpznz3o,Well for the Ostheer going for either Panthers or Tigers is pretty much necessary. Some players are crazy and good enough to pull of a mobile defence Puma doctrine play but otherwise there arent many options. By the time the Panzer IV arrives the U.S. easily is on its way to their first Jackson if they went for a Sherman first or already has one thus completely negating the Panzer IV. The StuG G is entirely useless for the cost because you need at least two of them to be effective  at that point a Panzer IV combined with a PaK makes more sense even though it still is a poor choice. The best way is simply to either hold out fighting with Fausts and PaKs depending on the American playstyle a viable option and tech up to get Panthers or hold on and get an early Tiger.Depending on the map the Elefant commander with spotting scopes dat visual range! is also a viable option especially as you can use your halftrack to lay down mines less damage than Tellerminen but immobilise vehicles making them easy targets for the Elefant,CompanyOfHeroes,cq0rzfh,1,t5_2rn3p

Im pretty sure their radios also work for allied paras so you can get your radio network across the whole map if you want to.

IR STGs also negate cover and will slaughter anything within medium range but are a lategame response and also doctrinal.You can try using a light vehicle like the puma to crush the walls of the building by backing up and running into it over and over. The Flak halftrack is also great vs buildings.While grenades are hit and miss with buildings keep in mind they are more effective the smaller the structure and they will go exactly where you click.

3906719,0,t3_3554q3,I actually find OKW easier to play against compared to Wehrmacht. You say you are winning early game so Ill skip that. I tend to get an LT as soon as I have  fuel so that I can get his BAR and prepare for the M HT. Depending on circumstances you might want the . cal to suppress his infantry rushes but if you can fend him off with your rifles and RE use the Volley fire it pins really quickly then you might not need it. I get bazookas soon after because you will face pumas or their flak HT. Killing these early on will seriously set them back. Once you have your M HT you can use it to support your infantry to suppress and shred his blobs. Always screen with at least squad you need to keep their AT infantry away from your M.If their AT infantry start to close with your HT which you should reverse into combat just start driving away. Its forward gear will let it zoom out of combat and its guns can still put a lot of firepower down even on the move. Also when its moving the Panzershrecks will be less accurate. Once you have enough fuel move up to tanks. I prefer getting a Jackson first because your infantry and HT should be providing enough antiinfantry support.,CompanyOfHeroes,cr1lmji,1,t5_2rn3p

They are for medium range and cost  muni vs  muni. You have to get really close and the bleed closing in on green cover grens will force them away since lmgs are good at all ranges they are much easier to use. IfA dug in opponent is hard to dislodge? Are you seriously complaining that you cant just charge down a squad in green cover without taking losses?gta gren squad comes across  BARs in green cover they can just rifle nade it and clean it up while still being under the cost of the rifle squad. Rifle nades are hugely telegraphed and really only truly effective against bunched squads just like conscript molotovs. They have the same flight time as the clock on a regular grenade when you factor in the launching animation and they have a minimum range. What does all this mean. CLOSE AND FLANK. Your riflemen have smoke use it. Close and flank. Your riflemen have bars. Use them. Close and flank. This isnt hard. Indeed this entire paragraph is negated by smoke one of the most powerful and underutilized mechanics in the US inventory.gt Axis can easily get an MG for every rifle squad. It wont be a v fight it will be a v.And if they do they have decided to play a game where they entrench.

The upside is that you will deal with fewer of them than say conscripts and they are much more expensive to reinforce than conscripts..  They are at their strongest relatively early in the game before combined arms is as important.  They are still strong in the lategame but they are EXPENSIVE what wweapon upgrades and high reinforce cost.j.  Best way to deal with them early game is a loose group of grenadiers with maybe one not two! HMG.  Dont be afraid to fall back not full retreat if he smokes and charges with a bunch of squads.  This costs him munitions and grouping his riflemen like that stops him from spreading them across the map which is when theyre strongest..  As time goes on aim for a balanced grouped force.  As part of an army grenadiers contribute much more pound for pound than riflemen.  They can heal others build bunkers and have lazerguns wthe lmg upgrade.

I love watching them loft over the Churchill and land on top of the enemys tank. Theyre so easy to mass two on every heavy engineer squad for what feels like no cost at all. And they do absolute work to heavys. With the arty doctrine a pair of churchills and like  PIATd heavy engineers I was able to take on a KT and a JT at the same time and not a single squad or tank was lost. And thanks to the wonderful repair bonus those churchills were back up to full health in like  seconds. Also they vet up so damn quickly with those things. Just picking two up practically guarantees triple veterancy. ,CompanyOfHeroes,cups0ah,1,t5_2rn3p

5057276,0,t1_cuvcqj0,Global vet was actually brilliant and very poorly communicated. The biggest issue was that Wehr vet was perceived as being identical to American vet when the reality couldnt be different. American vet was much much stronger as it should be for earned vet rather than bought with the main exception of Wehr infantry vet  which served as a necessary BAR counter. If theyd made it clear how much worse Wehr vet was than American theyd never have had people turn on it as they did.The genius of purchased vet was that it required a Wehr player to invest to meet the effectiveness of American troops. It greatly diversified the factions by making the Americans a faction of generalists with an emphasis on unit retention and the Wehrmacht a faction of combinedarms specialists who could afford a little more attrition if they specialized in infantry.It was perfect in v and v but the flaw was that it broke down in vs and vs. Its a shame because differences between CoH Wehr and Americans was brilliant and subtle and much of that has been lost in the transition to CoH.,CompanyOfHeroes,cuvlche,1,t5_2rn3p

Reality is if your opponent is paying attention behind green cover and forcing you to cover large amounts of ground your going to be in a world of hurt before your in effective range.Russian conscripts work best in numbers. No scratch that. They work best when you have a fuck ton of bullets flying at the enemy. Cons have trouble standing toe to toe even against basic grens when in equal numbers. By working in pairs or even in groups of three makes them devastating to most german defenses because its hard to deal with conscripts swarming from every direction or overrunning your green cover  outnumber them by rifles. Alternatively like someone else said here supporting your conscripts with MGs allows you to get the bullet swarm upper hand  suppression support. Russian MGs are very well suited to the task of literally following your conscripts around and just laying down the fire quickly since they can move really fast and deploy really quickly adding a lot of fire power to your conscripts advancing forward.,CompanyOfHeroes,cxbpbtg,1,t5_2rn3p

6039801,0,t3_3y4tnn,The biggest strength of brits early game is good micro of infantry can shut down OKW. And OKW needs early game momentum to stay strong. They have great late game power but if early game goes south mid game can be a struggle.Best advice for an OKW player pick on individual squads as much as you can. If there are two brit squads in cover they can easily be microed to just trash your assault so just disengage and push differently if you run into that. If you see a vickers just dodge it until you have indirect. And kill mortar pits as soon as you can. They can trash your buildings VERY quickly.Other than that always have a raktenwerfer. They are the bane of brits. All other at options brits have a decent if not great counter to. There is no reliable way too kill support weapons for brits aside from being in range of a mortar pit. Fireflies are amazing so if those are sighted use your armor as backupdeterrent.Never underestimate the PIAT as well. The brits may not have indirect options that are good but recon tommies with PIATs will trash those emplacements very quickly. They actually sight beyond PIAT range so attack ground with them is amazing.Thats all I have for now.

7030446,0,t1_d1d8gn2,A turtle is someone who plays very defensively they push up far enough to control vital parts of the map but then dig in and try to bleed you out slowly rather than going in for the kill. Indirect fire is the only sure fire cure. Blobbing you hit the nail on the head.The Commandos are a solid elite infantry unit and being able to spawn from buildings is huge. That said theyll struggle to close into range with anything but team weapons. It sounds like you already used them for exactly what they were designed for though so thats good.Get as many Land Mattresses as youd like as long as youre not delaying your tech too long. The more they try to turtle and dig in the more they need to be boom boom boomed on. However  and this is important  if you have the initiative and you have the map control think twice about getting a semi mobile artillery piece. Youre probably better off just continuing to pressure them with the traditional build path into a couple thousand Cromwells.,CompanyOfHeroes,d1d976j,5,t5_2rn3p

7247711,0,t1_d21mpc4,I agree my op is a baseless rant so Ill try explain my opinions a bit.Sturmtiger is not a gimped unit as soon as It gets called in and especially against usf the game has a time limit till Usf loses all of its vetted units because it has no way of countering. The sturmtiger and avre punish players for something they cant play around firing from fow. Now when Im playing vs people with good micro I cant watch engagements for longer than a few seconds before I have to move to different parts of the map you cant dodge Sturmtiger every time its totally unreasonable to say that its not like Stuka dive bomb where theres a big forewarning or demos where you can just make sweepers sturmtiger will just consistently wipe squads with no counter play because its such a hard to kill unit and it doesnt need to expose itself.  Now if it had the same weapon profile as say the brumbarr but with more aoe I think it fits into the games design more it wouldnt be mindless consistent t wiping of infantry but it would punish a player for blobbing and being careless with idle infantry.The sniper thing is just me being irrational but I do legitimately feel that the counter snipe meta is the most dull one Ive played in coh snipers should be killed by flanking infantry but it can walk over red cover at half Hp and survive several volleys. I just think the received accuracy should be toned downMy issue with NDA is more that there is absolutely  contact to the community other than a select few that know people at relic which triggers me quite a bit regarding any new content ever people always give up on this game because they think its over I just wish relic were more transparent with their plans for the game DLC commanders are my issue with paid content I think cosmetics and AA and theatre war are all the type of content that should be priced.

Ive personally not seen it since CoH where it could be as bad as a minute inbetween commands registering. Its a host side issue so theres not much you can do besides playing with people in your country or continent.,CompanyOfHeroes,d6ocbk9,1,t5_2rn3p
8742103,0,t1_d6ydqre,gtIm sorry but have you played his balance patch even looked at it fore you commented?Im sorry but no I have not played his mod. However I have watched several games of the mod and are aware of majority of major differences. gtUSF needed a t mortar but not the hilariously overpowered campaign one.I disagree as stated multiple places in this thread.gtThe mortar we even got during the patch test was balanced then they threw it out for the campaign one for no other reason than it was named properly. The mortar we got on release was buggy af. Also the mortar was changed because they already had the mortar model in game so they could use the correct assets for the mortar. The issue was not that the mortar was imbalanced so much that it was broken beyond belief. It had all the vet bonuses at vet  amp stacked them again as it vetted up. It also could track units through fow and had double the range it was supposed to. gt His views were not controversial the only controversial thing here is the horribly bad relic decisions.The fact we disagree on the necessity of the mortar in unmodded Coh would indicate otherwise and there was plenty of disagreements on the coh subreddit back when the june balance preview was available. FFS Nobody is saying everything ever done in that patch was garbage. The normalization of tank sizes was nice as well as the armor changes for heavy tanks. The mortar shouldnt of been added. There are still alot of units in the game that currently have no function due to ineffectiveness.His personal mod is irrelevant here. Saying he has no responsibility for his actions is just silly. ,CompanyOfHeroes,d6yeyjh,-1,t5_2rn3p
8742268,0,t1_d6yeyjh,No they litterally threw out the balance patch mortar and used the campaign one. Not just the models but the stats and the sight bug that was never fixed. They had a working and tested model that was weighed in on by Mirage WHICH WAS THROWN OUT FOR NO REAL REASON.Say again his work WAS THROWN OUT. Just because they left a vague mention that he helped hes now the target of ignorant people looking for someone to blame?

10583246,0,t1_dd74q3w,Ooo yeah I like the idea of morale. I have thought about this concept before and it would be cool if morale took into account a fear factor element like artillery and tanks Tigers for example soldierstanks dying around other units prolonged fighting stress and losing. It could be a bar that fills up and when it hits max theres a strong chance theyll break and retreat automaticallyThings that could reduce that would be staying out of combat resting numbers on your side winning officers nearby and etcThe only downsides I see are how you scale it in team matches and  maybe morale could add too much for players to also consider especially in a chaotic late game team matchBut hey I still very much like the idea and want to see it implemented if it works POh Wargame does have a morale system too in addition to logistics I mentioned. Calm Cautious Worried and Terrified I think. It affects their aim rate of fire and speed.

10905351,0,t3_5vtf4c,Heavy cav should probably be your first commander option.  Its just that good.Mechanized is actually pretty decent in vs.  The truck is good at pushing around okw early you can go heavy into light vehicles without delaying your medium tanks too much assuming you keep them alive and the arty call in is good against okw hqs.  You dont want it against ost but it is nice against okw.The other possibilities for your secondthird commander are rifle armor and tac support.  All are viable it just depends on what you are looking for.  Airborne is also decent but it isnt great and I think it works better in team games.  Infantry is mostly just a weaker tac support and recon support is simply bad.That said you can play whatever you want.  If you play well you can potentially win games without selecting a commander at all.  Commanders help obviously but picking a shitty commander that synergizes well with your playstyle is reasonable.,CompanyOfHeroes,de4t5g1,5,t5_2rn3p

Wipedhave had multiple wipes from all sorts of grenades with the latest patch including rifle nades bundled nades shock trooper nades and the gammon bombs. Some like the gammon bombs and bundled grenades certainly do not need a buff or cost reduction since they can already wipe fully spaced squads without any issue. Anecdotal evidence aside remember that infantry in green cover get a  damage reduction so its generally better not to bother wasting munitions unless they are really clumped up. However yellow cover only grants a received accuracy bonus harder to hit with small arms but comes with all of the familiar clumping issues. Therefore toss grenades at infantry in yellow cover for best effect. I do think it would be interesting if grenades applied suppression.,CompanyOfHeroes,dfmkqie,1,t5_2rn3p
