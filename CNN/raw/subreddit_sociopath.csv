1297435,0,t1_cifhyks,Abused people often form this attachment to their abuser where they will come back over and over hoping to get better treatment. Whats the psychology of that? In my own relationship with my abusive wife I try to get better and better at understanding her and dealing with her so that it becomes a kind of game. Theres also the ability to forget pain so that even the hope of a kindness is enough to pull us back. Theres also love hormones attachment that denies all logic.Id say he loved you but thats trite. You probably gave him a depth of feeling he didnt ever have before and wanted again. Maybe even the abuse felt real compared to other interactions.As for nurturenature its a fun argument though the only reasonable conclusion seems to be that you need the talents and you need the opportunity to develop them. A sociopathic family clearly provides both. Twin studies show that the talents are strongly inherited which suggests to me that sociopathy has evolved over time as a successful set of talents.,sociopath,cifktt4,1,t5_2rdt9

Sociopaths want the same thing that everyone wants. Its just they are more likely to try to get it by any means necessary. Think of something that you really want but your conscience or morals or whatever stand in the way of you actually going and taking it.. Usually what I want is a person. If someone is interesting to me I try to become friends with them. Find out what type of person they are and then become a person that they would enjoy.  However sometimes I want material things like for example I recently needed a place to live. So I spent a summer becoming friends with this guy I knew who was looking for a place with one of my friends. I initially wasnt invited to be one of the roommates and I feel like that would stop a normal person right there. But I didnt want to live with a random person so I basically included myself in every conversation they had about housing and eventually it was almost unconsciously for him I was just part of the group and he would tell me whenever we were gonna look at a house and stuff and now I live with him. And then funny thing is that I turned out to be a better roommate than the person he initially was gonna live with.,sociopath,cmghpyy,3,t5_2rdt9

4949446,0,t3_3inocg,College wasnt successful for me at all. I went for all the wrong reasons ended up hating my major after years of knowing that was what I wanted to do I was completely free with my body to the point I was putting myself at risk by being intimate with others and I was constantly in trouble with alcohol sexual partners administration and the police. My main focus was to try to cultivate relationships because I had no friends. That is when I realized that it was never my situation that caused me not to have friends in high school and that it was really only me. I didnt seem to really want them. I just liked the idea of them. At times when I should have lied I was brutally honest to the point of coming off mad and then times that I should have been honest I was constantly compulsively lying. I failed two semesters in a row and have yet to finish my degree. The only success I had in college was creating a cohesive line between the insecure girl I used to be and becoming who I am now. Before I thought something was wrong with me slowly in college I realized that I was different now I realize that its not a bad thing to be different and in this case I personally believe that it is better to be the way that I am. In college I gained my confidence and finally stopped caring about being different. ,sociopath,cuif1kq,4,t5_2rdt9

They cling to stereotypes so loyally that they are incapable of mingling with people like me Im sure theres some name for this phenomenon.

7260308,0,t1_d23a7o3,I shit you not I was seriously just thinking about this not an hour ago. I was sitting by myself watching the sun go down and waiting for some drugs to wear down before I went back to work. I was thinking about what percentage of time Im alone and its basically something like  of my life. I think a lot of people are. I think most people are. If you dont have an SO and live alone its possible the that first words out of your mouth for days are good morning on Monday. I dont technically belong in this conversation because I think I am capable of empathy. Ive just gotten to a point in which I truly find it impossible to relate to other people in more than a transitory way and I dont feel that I have any deep need to fill that gap right now. Mostly because Im really happy with my career the work Im doing the rest of my life. The truth is having empathy isnt all greener grass and group hugs. Have you met people? Just cause you know what theyre feeling doesnt make the majority of them even tolerable. Having a capacity for empathy doesnt stop loneliness or disconnection.My definition of loneliness is not exactly missing being in the company of others but feeling the lack of being in the company of those whom I feel I can be genuine with as was mentioned earlier in the comments. Yes you can be the center of attention and still feel lonely. You can feel lonely in a relationship you can feel lonely with family you can feel lonely in a world with . billion people. Which is totally absurd but no less true. I think loneliness is the human condition and how we deal with it define us as people.So keeping in mind that loneliness is a commonality between those with and without empathy  connection is the antitheses to loneliness or disconnection and becomes the only solution itself. How to really connect with someone? Theres only one way. Through authenticity. I think a lot of people trade in their authenticity to be liked to be popular to socially engineer themselves into a spot where they end up questioning who they are. I think most people have to do this to some degree and feeling disconnected is par the course. Im not directing this at anyone here its just my opinion about people in general. Being authentic whenever possible awards me the  few rare instances of connection I do have in my life even if they are in the end just an illusion.Some lose all mind and become soul insane.Some lose all soul and become mind intellectual.Some lose both and become accepted.BukowskiAt the end of the day my genuine self is probably a goddamn freak. Fuck it. Ill take loneliness over mediocrity any day. ,sociopath,d23g26k,2,t5_2rdt9

Sometimes humans display other emotions then that which they actually feel. Some are just posers. Some just narcisstic assholes. Stay updated on what they are on becuase the moment you arent those motherfuckers will turn on yo ass so quick without giving a shit and they call you guys crazy pssht. They seem to pick fights with people to impress others. If you want to destroy them mentally wait for the moment when they are humiliated and everyone is laughing at them to take action. They will wonder why you arent laughing or making fun of them etc and they will start to open up to you on a really deep level. Throw some fake weaknesses out there so that whenever they feel the need to betray you they dont have your real weaknesses but you have thiers...then crush them how..ever...you...like. Other methods that work is to copy their speech pattern movements and share similar not all because it comes off as suspicious interest...humans like relativity and similarity.

7624719,0,t3_4jocxt,I cant really offer any advice for coping with depression because all I ever did was drink and take drugs and that was only a very temporary fix. Exercise helps a great deal but its almost impossible to do when depressed.What I can tell you is that you shouldnt simply accept depression as part of life nor should you consider it part of having a personality disorder. I spent  years on and off of antidepressants and antipsychotics before I discovered that my depression was caused entirely by a hormone problem low testosterone and since fixing the hormone issue I am medication and depressionfree for over  years. Fixing my hormone problem made me feel emotionally strong for the first time in my entire life and I wish that I or my doctors had realised it sooner. Somewhat telling of healthcare these days  I actually found the problem myself after experimenting with anabolic steroids. An expartner also cured her depression by fixing her hormone problem hypothyroidism.There are so many things that can cause depression that walking away from the doctors office with a script for Celexa and considering the matter finished is frankly ridiculous. Investigate diet vitamins hormones have a full bloodwork panel done alcohol and drug usage bugs and infections i.e. Lyme disease and then as a last resort start looking at psychiatric causes.IANA doctor but I am somebody who suffered depression for  years longer than I had to as a result of sloppy healthcare and I would like to spare others from that experience where possible.,sociopath,d38w1li,3,t5_2rdt9

That I agree with but for the purpose of study it is beneficial to use set criteria to determine a point where you can say that one is a sociopath.

To the point where our whole existence is based off of mountains of lies starting basically since the beginning of time? That the facts of our lives can beprobably are muddled to the point that we are living a lie and we dont even know it? To put an example out there you could have two people with almost identical lives but they view the world entirely different based on how things were presented to them originally in life doctoring a huge amount of indoctrination. Couple this with bias and cognitive dissonance and you get a human being that lives a lie and cant even help it due to the psychological walls that are in the way. The next problem is that even if someone could expose the person living a lie to the truth would it actually be the truth?

Its a very extreme case I dont have ASPD but the bipolar does give many ASPD symptoms even on the downs as I find my downs are much more of an empty than a depressed. The mania though especially you become very very focused on yourself and stuff like leaping off buildings and all that are some serious extreme cases far from the common. Your level of being delusional isnt normally that awful mostly just being super goal orientated thinking youre incredibly smart the next Freud. Strong seeking of stimulating and often dangerous activities tends to give a heavy disregard of others in these acts though that isnt always a symptom for all people some become overly empathetic. It works a lot in the brain like how cocaine does dunno if anyone here has done blow or seen someone on it but imagine that for days to months will create some ASPD symptoms alone.

9661416,0,t3_5bvzv3,Actually a question to you guys. My mom was very abusive and manipulative. One example of this is when she brought my brothers to the front yard put a gun to her head and threatened to kill herself in front of them. Ive always kinda wondered what was wrong with her. I figured that it was either borderline personality disorder or ASPD. I feel like the purpose of making a show of it and threatening to kill herself in front of my brothers had the goal of emotional control over them. If it was BPD it would have been done because she genuinely wanted to end her life. There would be no need to make a show of it if that were the case.I talked to my uncle who has dealt with similar issues their father was an abusive piece of shit. He said that its not BPD but it can look exactly like BPD. He said that it stems from the need to have control and the inability to let your guard down and trust others.

I think people sometimes say some here may just be depressed and saying that they may be depressed instead of being sociopathic because that may actually be the case for a few people like MDMA and at least a couple others before. Using idea of sociopathy or antisocial behaviour as a coping mechanism or something like that. Itd sound like an attractive label to someone depressed I think.  To touch on something said earlier in the thread about whether or not shallow affect could be mistaken for depression I think the reverse is probably more likely mistaking depression and anhedonia for shallow affect.gt Oh and to the sociopaths who are always trying to disprove each other I just want to know why. Do you just want to be so special to believe that only you and a select few have some special disorder  which is btw nothing to really be proud of?  I dont think I am really who you mean here because I havent at all gone around claiming most posters are or arent sociopaths but I have posted a couple of times doubting people who I think sound depressed and Ive seen a couple threads before where I think it sounds more like the thoughts of someone with autism and pointed it out.  I dont think its special or do it to put others down or selfvalidate and look like a real sociopath but I think if someone sounds a certain way it can be good to call it out as its a potentially harmful label to attach to. I would say the few times Ive done this have been more expressing concern or trying to help and make someone think twice and introspect more than anything to do with myself.,sociopath,db5t3j9,3,t5_2rdt9

10325357,0,t1_dcecfqk,My perception is that regret is an intellectual property while guilt is an emotional one. People that feel remorse will also regret their actions but it is coming from how the situation made them feel or made others feel. When we regret something it is because of how it may have effected our end goal or negativily impacted our plans. It is not coming from a place of emotion but a place of necessity. We use regret to understand how to better approach a situation versus how to hurt less people with our actions.If you do not have regret it is likely because that event did not cause you enough inconvenience for you to reflect on how it could have gone better.

10390925,0,t1_dclvktx,Hi! Heres a summary of the term No True ScotsmanThe No True Scotsman NTS fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs when a debater defines a group such that every groupmember posses some quality. For example it is common to argue that all members of my religion are fundamentally good and then to abandon all bad individuals as not true myreligionpeople. This can occur in two waysDuring argument someone redefines the group in order to exclude counterexamples. Instead of backing down from all groupmembers are X to most groupmembers are X the debater simply redefines the group.Before argument someone preemptively defines some group such that the group definitionally must be entirely good or entirely bad. However this definition was created arbitrarily for this defensive purpose rather than based on the actual qualities of the group.NTS can be thought of as a form of inverted cherry picking where instead of selecting favourable examples you reject unfavourable ones.,sociopath,dclvkw1,3,t5_2rdt9

10513413,0,t1_d9wbxhv,It seems odd to me that autism and ASPD would be neurologically similar. Im no psychologist so take all this with a grain of salt but I am autistic and have had a very longstanding relationship with someone with ASPD. Autistic people tend to be those who are very poor at reading other peoples emotions. They tend to not be able to see Or at least interpret and take into account more subtle social or emotional cues in others. They can sort of ass their way around this by developing an increasingly broad body of knowledge about how the social world works and it IS true Although unlikely that an autistic person can be terrifyingly charismatic on occasion. But they dont usually start out that way. And let me tell you Even with comorbid DID seemingly designed as a social coping mechanism the trick is extremely difficult for me to pull off. Even one social event can exhaust me completely for days afterward. In the disability rights community this is called running out of spoons. ASPD people on the other hand tend to be absolute masters of emotional manipulation and societal control. Thats not just a stereotype. Even the most powerless among them can usually make a fantastic first impression. The one I know is hyperanticipatory of what other people want and need and can alter her personality at will to match the situation. Her weaknesses are that in her case what I intuitively grasp takes her conscious effort. In a weird sense were mirror images of one another because of course her mastery of people is completely foreign to me. We tend to treat disorders as if they prevented a person from doing something at all when in Reality they just make it a pain in the ass. But my lovey and I being neurologically similar even if were just at more extreme ends of a spectrum of human difference....Doesnt seem likely. Especially given that back in the old Wandering Internet Asshole days we had we deliberately acted as a straight mancrazy man combo to destroy whole forums.  P,sociopath,dczt2wu,1,t5_2rdt9

Like I know I get mood shifts from mundane things but the things are so mundane that the second Im not in that dramatic mentality I cant even remember what it was I was freaking out about.Usually Im selfaware enough to at least keep a clear ironic distance from my feelings when theyre retarded. So when it comes to lashing out I guess I usually just express it in a nonserious edgelord fashion to my close friends over text. Or if Im with a friend in person Ill just kind of shut down andor leave and listen to music or something.I guess music is how I deal with overdramatic emotions for the most part. I dont really have any responsibilities because I dont have any responsibility lol so I can listen to music and let artists vent for me pretty much all day.I should say also that I have antisocial and schizoid features as well as anxiety and severe depression so my experiences are probably different from the average BPD person.

11751676,0,t1_dgs11pg,My guess is that the system in place for herding people down the path is not designed for people with ASPD.  That being said empathy is only one way of manipulating people into behaving in a certain way.  There are plenty of other biological and sociological pressures that can be placed upon a person particularly with it starting at such a young age to keep them in line.  Perhaps another way to look at it might be that rather than people with ASPD cant be brainwashed would be that ASPD are the people who werent brainwashed.  That the underlying conditions existed for many but were managed enough for them to fit into the system and thus never get the ASPD label.This is all just me thinking out loud of course.  Im at a pretty early stage in terms of thinking about this stuff.  ,sociopath,dgs2ymk,4,t5_2rdt9
