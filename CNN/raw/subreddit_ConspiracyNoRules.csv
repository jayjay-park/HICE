This can constitute stalking which the main sub is against.To avoid things like this in the main sub we need to get better with the way we word things and stop the direct calling out of users by names. But feel free to do what you please here as long as it does not violate Reddits terms themselves.,ConspiracyNoRules,cfnqrfn,2,t5_30ia4

Cant just give up on the home hub.But whereever there is a theory silenced for no reason well be there.Wherever there is idea that most would downvote just because they be hatin well be there.I really thought i had more but i dont what I mean is those that wish to discuss things that seem to get shut down all to quick for whatever reason on other forums of conspiracy NoRules will have your back.I ask only one thing watch out for those that would and will try to derail or demean this forum into oblivion.,ConspiracyNoRules,cfpstzy,1,t5_30ia4
