4337511,0,t3_3antiu,My friend Allah forgives all sins he is the most beneficent and the most merciful. We all go through stages that we regret. Its fantastic that you have come to Islam it is the most sensible path the simplest and the best. Like uTariq said when you take Shahada it will be as if you are a newborn and all of your previous sins will be washed away. All sins can be forgiven through serious repentance. Do you know how to pursue reverting? Is there a masjid near you? Also do you have an English Quran or if youre not a native English speaker a translation of the Quran in your first language? Use this time to really learn my friend and your path into Islam will be easy and well informed it took me  months to fully revert!Asalaamu alaikum wa rahamtaullahi wa barakatuh.,converts,csekfja,3,t5_2u6cs
5744560,0,t1_cx8nfft,I gave you an answer.  I never stated that the murders spurred me to embrace Islam  thats just a strawman your willful misrepresentation of what Ive said.  The attacks spurred me to investigate Islam as I realized I had very little knowledge of the religion.The rest of your questions are loaded horseshit and I will not dignify your outrageous implications with comment.Good day.  Peace be upon you.,converts,cx9636s,2,t5_2u6cs
8343843,0,t3_4to4kn,Suicidal thoughts are no fun and intentionally killing yourself has disastrous effects on your life in the hereafter. With depression and other debilitating mental illnesses on the rise were seeing a rise in suicidal ideation among people of all faiths including Muslims.Theres no denying that suicide is unacceptable in Islam. Though you may be suffering its worth remembering that no matter what affliction or sickness or tragedy or worry befalls the Muslim bearing it with patience is a means of expiating sin. Subhanallah! What a beautiful reward from Allah. Hes so full of mercy that even the things that seem to harm us have an element of help.Take this from someone whos been suffering from depression among other things for most of their life. This world is a prison for the believer and paradise for the disbeliever. Avoid wishing for death and instead make dua for a beautiful end. There is no beauty in suicide.,converts,d5kj90p,1,t5_2u6cs
