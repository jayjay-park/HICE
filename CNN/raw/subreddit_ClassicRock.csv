3815250,0,t1_cqr5x4k,Well there are a lot of songs based off of poems and such but the poetic elements might come from the poems themselves if you get what Im saying? Anyway I was thinking The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Iron Maiden not exactly classic rock but close. Obviously based off of a very famous poem but it does retain some of the poetic elements in the lyrics those that arent direct lines from the poem.,ClassicRock,cqr63ur,1,t5_2r3kh

5227138,0,t1_cvg16mu,I like Dylan throughout. I heard that he does different renditions of his songs and if I go now He may be playing all that Martin and Sinatra stuff. Its good but thats not what I want to see. Rolling Thunder Review is where its at.I would love to see the Stones but those tickets are astronomical!Yeah I heard Roger had meningitis. That sucks. I wish him well.Back in  My friend surprised me surprised me at school with tickets to a concert featuring Def Leppard Foreigner and Styx and it was going to be awesome! Our first concert together and seeing pretty cool band. When I got home later that day I saw a MySpace bulletin post from ACDC yeah it was long ago announcing tour dates for their upcoming Black Ice tour and our city was on the list and I called him immediately ACDC is our favorite band and the main reason were best friends and told him. Less than a week later we sold out tickets to a friend and got ACDC tickets. It was a trip.Charlie Daniels was awesome! Saw them at a Volunteer Jam in  or so. He was headlining and supporting was Marshall Tucker Band and The Outlaws. It was a great show. He knows how to throw a concert. I loved Country music before rock so it was a real treat. I would absolutely see him again.,ClassicRock,cvg27u6,1,t5_2r3kh

From what Ive seen on eBay they sell for  in a good condition and thats for the original harvest print or a  reprint from an original. For mint condition with everything like new I think they go for about . If it was never opened or one of the rarer issues they can cost upward of .
