Im just skeptical because I dont think his role on Kentucky has showcased his diverse skillset whatsoever. Randles best asset at the next level is his ability to attack the basket from the perimeter as a bigman. Calipari doesnt need him to do that at all given his wealth of perimeter talent who have all underperformed. His back to the basket game is incredibly ugly but has been effective. Im in the camp of people who dont think that will translate to the next level given his size advantage in college. I think he has a good head on his shoulders a great motor and a shot with potential as his mechanics arent broken.,sixers,cfpwhtr,1,t5_2scmr

Remember that the draft is still a crapshoot at best there are many busts every year and MCW is proven to play at a very high level with still a lot of upside to go.Sometimes basketball fans who think about these things a lot tend to overrate the trade value of these draft picks especially when the draft starts getting close and the hype about these players reaches a crescendo. Draft picks are very valuable but so are good young players.This is just my opinion. None of us are GMs and know the actual value but thats my gut opinion.

I saw in person Kobe go against Rip Hamilton in high school.  Kobe was phenomenal.  But thats besides the fact their games arent comparable at all.  Kobe could shoot he was crazy athletic.  Exum seems athletic in the sense that he can stretch the court but I see no real leaping ability and no willingness to really take full advantage of his size.  Plus the one thing we have to see of him going against USA competition he got manhandled thru roughly before finally checking out of the game.

2409585,0,t3_2n1msn,Let me preface this by saying Im an optimist and I feel the need to look at this team and season with a positive spin because its the only way I can watch but I also believe what Im saying.We lost back to back games by  last year before the deadline so with Spencer Thad and Turner on the team. I dont think that just having veterans means anything.Regarding looking defeated and not playing with fire who is likely to play harder or take losses harder a young guy who is fighting for a job in the NBA or a veteran journeyman who is only here for the money? I think the vet would probably get fed up with losing faster than a kid with something to prove would.I also disagree on Hollis Thompson having no business being in the NBA and we havent really seen enough of Covington or Gordon I guess to say it of him either.I dont think the record really reflects leadership or culture. I think the culture is coming from the coaching staff and the front office. The team is building towards the big time by putting in real investments the practice facility the coaching staff and analytics departments future assets. Everybody that knows anything about Brown Malik Bruce Bowen other former Spurs has talked positively about the culture that hes currently creating and the process that hes going through. I also think MCW has shown quite a bit of leadership and that when the wins start coming these early growing pains are going to make the good years seem even better.Also I wouldnt want vets just for the sake of vets. Id rather see a guy who might be a longterm piece get a shot to earn playing time. The team isnt going to be good this year regardless. Theres no real point in sinking a lot of money into players who wont be part of the future if the losses arent detrimental in the longterm. That cap space might be better served elsewhere through trades where we could get assets Im aware though that we have so much cap space that even signing a few players wouldnt hinder us from having a ton of space.It sucks to watch the losses but I dont think theyve gone too far.

2515756,0,t3_2ofirb,The main positives that come from Embiid playing this year selling a couple extra tickets generating a bit more excitement and positive media reports are things that they rightfully shouldnt really give a shit about at this stage of the rebuild.The main positives to Embiid not playing this year eliminating the risk of reinjury getting a much better chance at a better draft position giving them more leverage in potential trades of the Sixers draft pick by making it seem more likely that the Sixers are willing to just draft another big man are things that they definitely do give a shit about.If it was up to the Sixers I dont think he would play this year.

4065112,0,t3_374eez,Thats a really good read.  Heres the point that I think that hes making  Embiid wasnt tested by our crazy system of school and AAU teams where most people are proven durable or not.  Now hes in the intense setting of college ball and his body is betraying him.Im no sports physician but I dont think it is that simple.  Its not like theres a spectrum with Greg Odens knees on one end and Tim Duncan on the other.  Thats too deterministic for me and as an American I just wont stand for it.  P  I think that durability is a function of flexibility conditioning strength genetics and luck.  And I think that people can work hard to improve some of those components.The college athlete who wrote the post was coming from an experience of trying to prove himself to scouts.  He was right to be aware of significance of each of his opportunities to make an impression.  This meant a grueling schedule and significant personal risk.  Embiid had a different experience.  He was discovered as a prospect and put on a path of rapidly increasing intensity.  After making his impression on the scouting world that intensity caught up with him and hes basically been rehabbing ever since.  But thats the important part  when Embiid was drafted he no longer had to spend himself aggressively to make an impression on scouts.  He hasnt played any games yet but hes made it into a guaranteed contract on a professional sports team.  His physical health has become an asset to safeguard and nurture and he has all the assets of a professional training staff and a progressive front office looking out for him.  His back and foot werent up to the task before but now hes had a significant amount of time to build a foundation of physical health that might give him more durability as his career moves forward. Again Im no sports physician but this is how I dearly hope things will turn out in the end.,sixers,crjngm9,8,t5_2scmr

4159978,0,t1_cruf113,My point is Hezonja vs. Saric is very close on talent alone. The bulk of the difference lies in the fact that Hezonja will play next season while Saric wont and will consequently avoid rookie scale.Adding the Miami pick could be enough to make someone bite on that deal but I think Philadelphia discounts the present more than any other organization so were more likely to make a deal like that from the other side.I think its really close but Id actually be more likely to pull the trigger if the script was flipped.Hinkie preaches optionality and this could be a solid case study.,sixers,crug4qs,1,t5_2scmr

4539689,0,t3_3d8x2d,I mean  hindsight is fun and all...gt Pick  MCW Rookie of the year flipped for the Lakers pick. Hard to evaluate as he was dealt for an asset. If we look at the pick in of itself it was a bad pick. While MCW had the best rookie season Giannis pick  and Schroeder pick  or even Gobert pick  have much more potential and would be keepers going forward. Look I was not a big MCW fan at all but I wouldnt call it a bad pick. Sure its fun to cherrypick the  guys out of the next  picks that wouldve been more useful but theres lots of guys before and after MCW who were worse picks than MCW.gt nd round McDaniels Grant Micic McRae Early but Grant seems like he will be a meaningful contributor.. could be a decent bench player a good team. McDaniels showed some flashes and seemed like the right pick at the time Miss early to judge especially with so many foreign players..Clarkson stands out as a big one.Honestly whats even the point of evaluating hits amp misses of nd round picks? Theyre lottery tickets. Its fun when you hit one but its not worth looking at oh they shouldve taken this guy with pick . Honestly Grant amp McDaniels is a pretty good haul for nd round picks in the same draft.gt  NBA Draft Pick  JahlilNot sure why this is even a section.

Based on last year I think Canaan has a very small chance of being a contributor on a contending squad. Jackson and Wilbekin are also longshots but worth trying out. So that leaves me with PG T.

5504308,0,t3_3qgfso,As a nonsixer fan I dont relate to you but I think I can offer some advice toward getting behind the team. Personally the sixers are my third favorite team in the league because I think Hinkie is the best GM in the league. I can only find one decision made by Hinkie that I think was the wrong decision picking Okafor over Mudiay otherwise every single other move by Hinkie has been amazing. With the sixers the exciting part of the team isnt the winning and the losing of the individual games this season its the higher battle that is going on between Sam Hinkie and the structure of the cba. He plays the CBA to perfection and watching him manipulate small parts of the CBA to give the Sixers the slightest edge is amazing. Heres the harsh truth about the process its not a guarantee to work its possible the Sixers go up in flames spectacularly and the whole Hinkie Era becomes a  for . But if you follow whats going on you realize the Sixers are mathematically positioning themselves to have the highest chance of success and thats all a management team can do. Get behind the team because of the day to day minutiae of Hinkies science experiment and while you enjoy that every once and a while you should watch whats on the court and realize its starting to look like something really really fun.

5893539,0,t1_cxs4ih3,Theyre FAR closer?  How?  Theyve accumulated assets which is nice but nothing has translated or shown a glimmer of hope in that direction.  Nerlens was evidence of it working last year but hes not a superstar and was never going to be.  Hes a solid defensive anchor at best.  Okafor might pan out he might not.  His last few games have been pretty discouraging but well see.  Embiid has all the upside in the world but he has yet to play an NBA game.  There isnt much in the way of tangible results from this aside from maybe Covington but its arguable what his role would be on a very goodelite team right now.  The Lakers pick looks like a sure bet not to convey at the moment.  Theyve gotten progressively worse by design recordwise over the last three years.When we set out on this tank a couple years ago I think all of us hopedthought wed at least be starting to put the pieces together in year .  Im sure some people even predicted it.  Most of it has been bad luck but theres no guarantee we come away with Simmons or the Lakers pick after all this.

5916629,0,t1_cxv5bgq,yeah to me its a contradiction of Hinkie going against the grain and trying to draft the perceived BPA no matter what even if they are loaded at that position but then also falling to traditional stereotypes of Cs are more valuable whereby he goes with the grain. I think an important point in this article is the reduced negotiating leverage you get from having  centers  teams will know you have to move one of them so while theyre all certainly valuable and will yield a good deal you may not be able to get the kings ransom that would have justified the selection. This is nothing against Jahlil since he is putting up numbers but its hard to feel good about the strategy behind the pick since im buying the argument that BPA has its limits when it comes to Centers due to their typical lack of versatility. Whatever the future entails for him I think that Hinkie deserves to be recognized with a good legacy for the way he has grown the sixers assets and positioned their future. I think his cutting edge strategies are by far at their best in deal making I particularly liked flipping MCW for the lakers pick. But taking Jahlil looks like a huge screw up. Not only with the benefit of hindsight where Porzingis might objectively be a better prospect by now but just from a pure strategic standpoint. I really think too that Jahlil was seen as the safe pick but the sixers are supposed to be finding their franchise guy and A LOT of media sources definitely said Porzingis had that most upside which implies he wouldnt have been as safe. They shouldve swung for the fences to try to get a game changer and not an Al Jefferson I think the duncan comps are rediculus to Jahlil given his lack of defense. This also would yielded a much more coherent team  even if Porzingis wasnt playing quite up to the level that he has in new york.,sixers,cxv79jo,1,t5_2scmr

6168016,0,t1_cyqpa79,I think Jahs scoring ability is incredibly hard to find. Hes already more advanced than big men who are offensive hubs. If he was on a better team he could score  a night. Bball Breakdown also did a piece on how point shots created by postups are better than any other type of point attempt and that the notion that post play is dead is absurd. Jah will almost assuredly draw double teams his entire career. As his body develops over the next few years I cant imagine anyone who will be able to stop him oneonone. If Jah fails in the NBA it will be because of his defense and relatedly his terrible motor getting up and down the floor. Nerlens is a special player and I love him. He fits the style of play that Brown amp Hinkie have built. But at the end of the day his biggest strength is that hes a long athletic freak and there are lots of those. Im not sure I wouldnt want CauleyStein over Nerlens for example. Heck even Jerami Grant is doing a pretty good Nerlens impression these days and he can guard wings and s and sometimes hit a jumpshot! Also Nerlens weaknesses are very concerning to me. He has terrible hands. So many turnovers because he cant catch a pass. Good passes too right on the money where all he has to do is dunk it. Those hands arent great with jumpers or free throws either. The kicker for me is that hes looked much worse than expected at guarding stretch s. The defensive versatility weve come to expect isnt quite there. Hes still an A rim protector and the steals he generates are awesome but hes kind of a tweener right now. Slim frame means he cant guard postup centers very well. Defensive  while guarding s is terrible. DeAndre is the epitome of what Nerlens wants to become. But if you cant catch passes and you cant bulk up DeAndres frame is huuuge its gonna be tough to get there. Even then Id prolly still rather have scoring prodigy who you can at least hide a bit on D like Dirk for instance.

6300587,0,t1_cz5spai,What? Youre implying that you can only make up for a lack of defensive rebounding by being a three point shooter? Nothing else? I dont follow that logic at all. He makes up for it by being our best offensive rebounder and being valuable on the offensive end. That doesnt even really make sense. He can still space the floor anyways since hes a good mid range shooter right now. I seriously dont get this. You cant just find a pattern and say this is the end all be all even though I cant find or put a finger on any real connection. Defensive rebounding and three point shooting arent actually connected. What you found is that big men who can space the floor usually arent tough players so they dont rebound well because of a lack of physicality. Also teams will usually play other stretch fours when these guys are on the floor so a lot of times these guys are out by the perimeter on defense and dont have a chance to get good rebounding position. So what do they do? They make up for it because they space the floor well. This DOES NOT mean that the only way to make up for poor defensive rebounding is by stretching the floor. Thats NOT at all how statistics work. ,sixers,cz5t08y,1,t5_2scmr

Okafor only does one thing well. Scoring. His passing is slightly below average his rebounding and defense  are  below average to not say bad. He gets tired quickly. Its not very versatile in both ends. Hes a player out of his time. He would be superb  years ago. The current game just augments his weaknesses to the maximum.

6557178,0,t1_czxhb5v,And you raise some good points as well. But very very disappointed?? Its hard to accept that as a valid criticism because he wasnt a great defensive player at Duke. I could see being very disappointed if he was a fantastic defensive player in college and dropped off considerably in the pros. Even then one would expect a rookie to gradually progress in key areas to the pro game. Also some of your assessments ascribe judgements that are really not supportable. Is he lazy without the ball in his hands or is he not yet conditioned for the pro game? Or does he not yet really know how to move without the ball? If you just simply accept that hes lazy it sets up a false narrative and leads to very very disappointed. If you allow for the fact that he still needs a true NBA offseason strength and conditioning program and could use veteran mentors to show him how to move without the ball then it sets up a counter narrative that suggests he can improve in those areas. Still to be very very disappointed that at  hes not yet a great defensive player is shortsighted. Moses Malone was a prolific scorer but NOBODY would say he was a great defensive player in the least bit. He got in the way at best. Same with guys like Kareem. Most NBA big men have traditionally been great scorers or great defensive players. The few who were good at both are mostly in the hall of fame. I think the initial article was nothing but clickbait. I dont think anyone at ESPN truly thinks Jah is a disappointment. I think they see him for what he is an extremely promising rookie big man who is mature beyond his years offensively. If this was a year ago and we knew our first round pick would be that wed have all said sign me up! That you expected great D to instantly accompany his fantastic scoring ability is a tad unrealistic  and I think those unrealistic expectations have led to the depth of your disappointment. No one who watches him play could truly say that rookie is really underperforming. Especially since most of the year he has led all rookies in scoring and ranked in rebounds and blocks.Im wondering if this is where we have gotten to in sports today? Folks are either headed to the HOF or they stink. Nothing in between. Id suggest that theres a big fat middle and there are decades of basketball history to verify it. Jah is ahead of the curve in some aspects needs to grow in others. And he has a TON of upside. If thats very very disappointing then I dont think youll enjoy watching basketball much going forward. ,sixers,czxke2n,1,t5_2scmr

6560362,0,t3_45gta6,It was cool because it came in a time where the Sixers were mediocre and still irrelevant in the city but when we played Miami in the first round it seemed like everyone in the city embraced the team by using the hashtag. From Philly.com It began during an exchange between Lou Williams and rookie Evan Turner. Although only in his first season Turner carries himself like hes part owner and it wouldnt take a sociologist to note Turners penchant for responding to advice or a critique with an explanation or justification. Rare is the occasion when Turner absorbs and nods without offering his own take on exactly what happened.Turner had trouble finding his place in the locker room. His oncourt struggles reflected this disconnect.So when Williams addressed Turner about some miscommunication or lapse or flawed execution and it wasnt met with a response this was a surprising event for Williams like turning on the TV but not hearing the audio.Whats wrong man show your love Lou remembers saying.

7174341,0,t3_4dri09,He failed because the product he put on the floor this year was so horrible that it caused ownership to lose complete faith in him and brought Colangelo in.He went into the season without a point guard and an offense with two incompatible bigs. The first  of the season we couldnt even get an entry pass into Jah. And on top of that he had two nonshooters in McConnell and Jerami getting huge minutes because we literally had nobody else. Okafor and Noel was an experiment that never even got off Stage   because the two things we needed for it to work Guard play amp Shooting were never there.I think Hinkie was amazing at finding value over expense. We saw it with Covington and Jerami  players who played beyond their contract. The problem is he never took that philosophy beyond the minimum. He never made a signing comparable to Cory Joseph in Toronto or Jae Crowder in Boston. We viewed spending as the worst thing possible and we were wrong  as long as you are getting more value from that player than what you paid him its a win.We needed to be bad to continue the process but we didnt need to be the worst team of a generation.

It is negatively affecting the business other franchises have.  It also has damaged the reputation of the league that a GM could sabotage his own team in order to have an easy attempt to build a championship.  This prevents others from following in his attempt and tarnishing the Championship to be an award for whoever could lose the best.Sports is competition.  Tanking for one year understandable.

But hes very inconsistent and hes struggling now that theyve moved him to different spots on the floor and he went into a slump. But Hollis sped up his release. Jah looks to have extended his range and gotten better from the free throw line. And as bad as it still is Noels jumper has gotten better.But to go from no shot to good shot takes years.

In  Sacramento was one of the best teams in the league and averaged . threepoint attempts per game. This year San Antonio put up . threes per game good for th most in the league and had their best season ever. Meanwhile the modern style Rockets attempted . threes per game and would get swept by San Antonio if they had to play them. The Warriors are just a great team up and down the roster and since they play at a fast pace and have two of the best threepoint shooters ever they take a lot of them.

NBA stats has him in the  percentile on pick and rolls thats pretty bad. I agree hes a solid passer for his position but its just that. Hes not really a playmaker. I dont really know about the JordanChandler comparisons. Jordan is a much better finisher and rebounder. Chandler is another guy who was a ton more efficient less turnover prone and a better rebounder. Amongst big men Nerlens is in the top  in AST so that is pretty good for a defensive minded big men. On the other hand big men arent known for being good passers. On our team he ranks th out of guys who played at least  minutes. Thats right in front of Jerami Grant and right behind Isaiah Canaan I think that puts it in perspective. I will say that Its somewhere I see him improving as he does show flashes of being a legit playmaker from the high postblock but hes not there yet. He does get to the rim a lot but  on free throws is bad. Just because its not Hack a Dwight territory doesnt mean its good thats an incredibly low bar. I said All NBA rd team because honestly I wasnt looking to get into any arguments over specifics but here we are. It really seems like you want Noel to be a good offensive player trust me so do I. But you cant make up statistics use bad comparisons and not look at the whole picture. What youre trying to do is make the definition of valuable offensively fit  Nerlens when its Nerlens who has to fit the actual definition. ,sixers,d333dxh,1,t5_2scmr

7750524,0,t1_d3n5g6c,Well first and foremost we arent saying Ingram will be KD. Fans obviously wish for the best among these prospects and thus we keep comparing Ingram to KD because his CEILING is indeed KD. Thats the best that he can be. But in all fairness KD was a far more polished scorer in Texas than Ingram was in Duke but physical profile wise they are very similar tho Ingram has a long way to go to even get near KDs level.He can very well end up a Tayshaun Prince too but thats unlikely considering his talent and potential is already greater than Tayshauns. Tayshaun Prince came in as a ampD guy a solid perimeter defender who can hit that perimeter shot. Ingram has already shown that he can be better than that. He got successful isos in Duke getting by guys with his handles and is deceptively strong for that skinny body frame as he occasionally charges right into bigger guys to draw fouls. Tayshaun at any stage of his career is never ever a consistent isoguy so theres that.To put it simply talentwise KD gt Ingram gtgt Prince. Thats why we never really compare Ingram to Prince because hes technically already better.Edit Also Ingrams game leans more towards offense than defense. KD is obviously an offensive powerhouse while Tayshaun has always been known for his defense. So playstylewise he seems to be the type that focuses on offense.,sixers,d3n6dyq,1,t5_2scmr

A player signed to an underpriced contract is an asset regardless of whether theyre a longterm gamechanger. You can always trade them or get something back in return if cap space becomes more important.Adding a couple wins this season is meaningless in the long run. Besides if Philly surges in the win column it will be because young guys improve or in the case of Embiid Saric and Simmons rookies exceed typical performance. It wont be because of some chump who couldnt find a multiyear deal elsewhere or a role on a contender. Those dudes are unwanted for a reason.And just as those guys are unlikely to add many wins the idea that theyll help develop young guys is even more doubtful. Theyll be new to the system have zero vested interest in the future and will be eyeing their next contract. From what we saw with Hawes and Turners declining effort and chucking the absolute worst dudes to add to a team of young guys are impending free agents.

Instead I found the opposite. In the past Per Diem predecessor John Hollinger noted that players coming off a down season tended to do better than expected but I found the effect both ways. How prospects perform at a young age appears more telling than whether they dominate younger opponents as upperclassmenAlso it links to another insider article from gt. Age. Everything about the draft has to be seen through the prism of age. This is hugely important yet teams underestimate it almost every year.Thats why veteran rookies like Ely Dickau Rafael Araujo and Francisco Garcia have underwhelmed at the NBA level while the freshman stats of a player like Chris Bosh take on new meaning when you understand his youth.Kevin Durant Jamie SquireGetty ImagesSkys the limit for Kevin Durant whos only years old.This years draft is especially alluring on the youth front since the NBAs new age restrictions resulted in several coveted players going the oneanddone route  most notably Kevin Durant and Greg Oden.On the other hand Florida States Al Thornton is walking around with a giant neon warning sign as he will turn  a little over a month into his rookie season.

Okafors . rebounding rate specifically is pretty mediocre that puts him th among rookies and out of the top  for centers.

Its very possible Murray is a defensive liability in the NBA and look what happened to Kevin Love as the rd option on the Cavs. He rode the bench and averaged  points a game in the series and they won he did grab  rebounds and played good in game ...still  pts  from threept land. Point is...you cant really have a guy who is a defensive liability out on the floor at the championship level when the matchups can be exploited. Do you think Murray even can be a better defender than Steph Curry is? I doubt it highly. At least Curry gets steals Murray is noted for having slowass foot speed and lateral quickness. ,sixers,d4hn3sd,6,t5_2scmr

Shooting sub  in Nov Dec April and only  in March. Ish Smith had a hot month in March shooting  on . attempts per game but outside of that couldnt hit a three to save his life. Also teams sagged off our shooters all season so its not like they were facing extremely tough perimeter defense. Our only scorer was Jah and teams knew that.OUR SHOOTERS COULDNT BUY A FREAKIN BUCKET LAST YEAR.,sixers,d5ari83,2,t5_2scmr
8267040,0,t3_4snlkq,Im for keeping Holmes over Wood although I will say I like Wood. Theres just no room for him.Theres two primary reasons. Which you pointed out Holmes is the better defender. Wood is a better rebounder sure but not enough to negate that Holmes is much better protecting the paint. As well Holmes shot has been bad in the SL but last year he proved he had some range.. More importantly when it comes to deep rotation guys they have to understand what their roles are on the team. Wood has shown hes a much better offensive player with the ball in his hands than Holmes but if Wood were to make the team hell never be in a situation where hes creating offense for him or anyone else.Wood is the perfect SL player because its an environment where youre free to show off what you can do and the competition level is low. But at the NBA level Woods likely ceiling is role player and hes not shown any idea of what role he needs to play. Holmes has.,sixers,d5axrk1,7,t5_2scmr

8275159,0,t1_d5br2vk,Well in this scenario we have  roster spots open. I wrote this pretty late so I actually forget about a few things like Korkmaz and our new vets. I think in this situation we have korkmaz stay another year his build is so slight and we probably keep Bayless to have bench shootingscoring.However if he plays well this year I could see us keeping him and in the hypothetical scenario where we trade a big we do it for future assets and have him at the backup  spot. I really dont think we keep henderson in this scenario hes making bank but itd only be for one more year so I could see us cutting him to go to a contender or if someone was willing to take the salary trading him for picks. Your right though Id definitely like to keep at least one of them for vet presence. Bayless is the better shooter so I say him.

8866919,0,t1_d7dc10v,One reason I have heard for reaching the salary floor besides not wanting to waste the money is that the salary not used is split between the players. BUT if I remember correctly the players decide how the money gets split up. The Stepover pod laid the argument out like thisSome players might believe that they deserve a larger portion of the money. This seems most likely in the case of Hollis or Nerlens as they have been paid very little comparatively and played through all those shitty lineups that included the Larry Drews or Jarvis Varnandos of the league. So why should Gerald Henderson who just got to Philly and got paid well to come here get as much of the leftover money as Nerlens or Hollis? I dont know if this will become an actual problem maybe they decide to split the money equally but it could be an issue if they dont reach the salary floor.Edit should also mention that players fighting over money could be really bad for team chemistry and morale.

Whenever someone breaks a th metatarsal bone by rolling their foot its usually caused by the tension thats caused by the tendon pulling the bone apart. Its messed up. The tendon is literally strong enough to snap the bone when pulled in an awkward way. Kevin Durant had this same injury and it took him forever to get back on the floor. There is usually poor blood flow in this area which delays healing. So when people say it typically takes  weeks to heal its more like . And then there is rehab of course.

9410472,0,t1_d98qsbw,Personally these are my thoughts The idea that he is going to command some starting level guard that shoots well from  and is a great defender is likely way overblown.  We probably wont get anything close to that given how this has transpired and he is on the last year of his contract. The next window to trade him will be if a team like the Warriors really feel he fills a need and they are trying to win now.   But it probably wont be anything substantial.  The trade deadline may bring a surprise.  Some team is looking to tank some decent player on another team wants to relocate etc. If hes still here after the deadline and Embiid is healthy I do think theres a chance they let him walk.  Perhaps a sign and trade but that  seems to be happening less often these days.  I think they think the dropoff from Noel to Holmes really isnt that substantial Holmes will still have  more years left on his deal I think and they will decide they will only resign Noel if its on an extremely reasonable team friendly deal which I dont think Noel will agree to. ,sixers,d98udfw,1,t5_2scmr

I dont want to draw conclusions from a small selection of minutes while hes rusty but there arent any indications that hes changed from last season or college even.It would be nuts to trade Noel without giving him and Jo time together on the floor.

9768037,0,t3_5eyyoc,I think the reason to why everyone hated the way the rebuild happened was because there was no denying what we were doing. Hinkie was constantly trading players for picks and veterans then waiving veterans drafting players who were known to not play due to injury or overseas and then not signing any real NBA level players but going to the D league or undrafted players. IMO I think if Hinkie had gotten the number one pick in  and  then he would still be our GM.

9789295,0,t3_5fe4h9,There are two numbers to keep in mind  and .Thats the number of games and average minutes per game that Joel Embiid played his entire career at Kansas.So far this season Joel Embiid has played in  games and is averaging . minutes per game. He has already played . of the total minutes of his entire college career in the NBA.The fact is that he has not played a lot of basketball in his career and his body already failed on him once. To expect him to suddenly be able to play  minutes a night is asinine.Innings limits are nothing new in baseball. You wouldnt let a kid whose never thrown more than  innings in the minors to suddenly throw  in the MLB. His arm is simply not ready for that kind of work load  you need to ease him into it. Its the same thing with Joel Embiid.He needs to build strength in his foot. He needs to build stamina. Weve been spoiled by what weve seen so far and it freaking sucks to see him on the bench for half of every game but we cannot stray from the path.By the end of the year Id like to see Embiid up to  minutes a game. If you can get  games out of him at roughly  minutes per game then I consider that a win. Because that means next year his body should be ready for the grind of a full NBA season and we can enjoy a full season of EmbiidSimmonsTop Pick and maybe a star free agent? This team is poised to go  real quick. Just as long as we dont get greedy and rush things.,sixers,dajqrss,11,t5_2scmr
9799783,0,t1_dal127a,Which is something that not enough people talk about. From Woj via Herbertgt Miller didnt make it easy for Philadelphia to draft Porzingis at No. . The Sixers wouldnt be afforded Porzingis physical nor get a private workout nor even a facetoface meeting. After most of the pro day executives cleared out of the gym in Vegas in midJune ers general manager Sam Hinkie lingered to meet with Miller. Hinkie stopped him in the lobby area and asked Miller about a chance to sit down and visit with Porzingis. gt You said that I would get a meeting with him here Hinkie told Miller KPs agent.gt I said Id try and its not going to work out Sam Miller responded.gt An awkward silence lingered the GM and agent standing and staring. The Porzingis camp wanted no part of the Sixers situation at No . Miller couldnt stop Philadelphia from drafting Porzingis but he could limit the information they had to make a decision. And did. No physical. No meeting. No workout. The Sixers passed on Porzingis on draft night clearing the way for the Knicks to select him.Thats why I dont think its totally proven that they twisted Hinkies arm into taking Okafor.

Fultz would be most complete offensive player in the field by a lot and would have the same defensive tools and potential that the others shown. He would be very much be in the conversation.  he goes at the very least n and possibly n if you dont take what KAT is doing right now and only what he did in college. DLo was nowhere near the same caliber of offensive player or defensive. Still KAT probably goes n because centers with those type of tools are extremely rare.  hes at least n and side by side with Simmons until draft day. Taking into account our needs in the backcourt and they being in the same base of talent theres a very good chance we take him ahead of Simmons,sixers,dbwlo99,1,t5_2scmr

10265301,0,t1_dc7lni3,He has another superstar next to him in Lillard so he isnt even running the show really. They have solid rotational players around them. The only thing they are really missing is a guy that is an elite rim protector to guess what cover up the big holes that are Lillard and McCollum. Other than that they should be doing much better than they have. Especially on a weaker Western conference.Its starts to be that they are part of the problem why they are so bad.With that defense and that offensive output he should never be a rd best player on a contender. Not even close. A  type player that really only had a  season so far as a peak should never be a rd piece on a contender. That is setting the bar really low. Danny Green or George Hill are better fit to be rd guys than him and both are not considered ones although Green has put together great seasons that McCollum never did.

10280450,0,t3_5n7kn0,I feel like Im in the minority but I would make a very strong push for CJ McCollum. His skill set is an absolute perfect fit next to Embiid and Simmons He is signed through  at  million AAV. The cap is likely to continue rising and is expected to hit  million as early as next season. He is only yearsold and has improved statistically every single season.I think most people would agree that the best case scenario would be to get the  pick and draft Markelle Fultz but not only we will have only roughly a  chance at best to get  its not even a sure thing hell be as good or better of a player than McCollum. With that being said Id be willing to part with. Noel or Okafor. Sixers unprotected  draft pick. Sixers  Lotter protected pickAt first glance I know that seems like a lot to pay but consider this The Sixers get a top  scorer in this league thats only  yearsold and is signed for  more years The Sixers could still possibly pick in the lottery with the Lakers pick this season In this scenario if the Sixers losed their  pick it would be outside of the lottery and they would still maintain the Kings unprotected pickEssentially youre clearing up the big man log jam and giving up a very valuable lottery ticket for a very good player.Now imagine some possibilities.Scenario McCollumEmbiidSimmons trio helps the Sixers attract a top free agent.Now you could have a starting lineup ofPG  Kyle LowrySG  CJ McCollumSF  Robert CovingtonTBDPF  Ben SimmonsC Joel EmbiidThat could be a Top  team in the East as early as NEXT seasonScenario Sixers get Lakers pickPG  Lonzo BallSG  CJ McCollumSF  Robert CovingtonTBDPF  Ben SimmonsC  Joel EmbiidMy point is that I dont think its too crazy to give up our pick this year for a guy like McCollum. If Embiid continues to improve and Simmons is who we think he is then we can create a seriously good team around that Big .Now before half of you kill me Yes I know McCollum is not a good defender but playing alongside Covington and Embiid should help cover that.The whole point of the process was to acquire assets to. Find a superstar. Build a teamI believe we have already completed step one. Now we need to move on to step two. I would love to have Fultz but I would be willing to trade a chance at him for  years of McCollum and the chance to build a team that can compete at a high level in both the short and long term.,sixers,dc9cfy6,11,t5_2scmr

The counterargument is Sam Hinkie just was a poor judge of talent and he couldnt hit because he didnt know but others could.  Put it another way The Bucks selected Giannis th in .  On their draft board did they have Giannis name highlighted and underlined with arrows pointing towards it as if to say they knew ahead of time he would be something special?  Or were they unsure and selected him without strong feeling?  I dont know.  I dont think anyone truly knows except their GM but he Im sure would give a diplomatic half answer when asked about it.  He did also hit on Malcolm Brogdon.Basically its not literally just a Bernoulli equation because you are assuming its strictly a math game but the players arent simply inputs into probability models.,sixers,dcoyf8e,2,t5_2scmr

10569812,0,t1_dd66yap,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,sixers,dd66ye5,1,t5_2scmr

It describes how driving a new strategy is like getting a huge flywheel into motion. Initially there is no movement  many people think that the strategy is absurd  it is almost impossible to imagine the flywheel at speed. With great exertion of will the CEO is able to deliver some results that get the flywheel moving. They appear small and trivial initially but create the credibility to move to more ambitious results. As more and more results accumulate more and more people throw their weight behind the wheel and the momentum of the flywheel builds and builds.More info here,sixers,de645mj,1,t5_2scmr

Also Noel needed and still needs A LOT of work on both his body and his game. What were you expecting after a massive knee injury and him being so young?gtbad locker room culture and not signing enough veteransThats fair but Colangelo isnt doing much better.gtdrafting Noel and MCW instead of KCP McCollum or Giannis which all look like superior playersYou could levy this criticism at every team in the league. Hindsight drafting is the lowesthanging fruit you can possibly reach for.gtdoes anybody remember the period between the end of  season and Embiids second surgery?Philly is still shitty with telling anybody what is going on with the health of their players. This has not improved with Colangelo.gtOkafors knee surgery original timetable was  weeks Kendall Marshall and Wroten returning unfit to play basketballIs this Hinkies fault or the players? Can Hinkie determine how Embiids body reacts? Can he change Marshall and Wrotens professional mindsets? Neither of those players stuck with another team afterwards. Its more likely they just suck.So all of your Hinkie Criticisms are moderately fair... most of them dont really apply to him but to the organization.Now lets look at how you grade Colangelogthe probably did very well in the  draft Did he?

10999883,0,t3_5x1f9n,Ok lets get this out of the way. What is the common thing with all this injuries? They are in the extremeties of the body and reduced blood flow is a thing which means slower healing. We are also talking about big dudes which another story. Diet is also a huge component of healing. And for Simmons i think its not the case. But for Jah and Embiid? Yeah. Jah is a selfadmitted foodie so his diet is not very balanced i believe. And Embiid loves shirleys so i might go on a limb and say that he digest more sugar than he should. If you remember a story last year about the mango drinks theres a reason they did that its because it helps the healing.And let be honest both Simmons injury and Embiid recent one were from freak accidents. Simmons landed on a teammate foot and Embiid fell awkwardly.This is has been a high combination of bad luck genetics extreme caution and not full committment to rehab the diet part.,sixers,deesy8p,2,t5_2scmr

Also you act as if any of us knows the future. All Im saying is that based on the decisions made over the past year Id expect them to move Embiid. At that point I dont have any attachment to the Sixers. Youre a homer. I get youre attached to the team and you want them to succeed. Youre allowed to hope that Im wrong.

11113358,0,t3_5ymnzt,Im very satisfied with Dario.  He plays with alot of maturity and polish for a rookie especially one thats adapting from euro ball.  I like his court vision his playmaking ability and ability to score.  Yes his defense and  ball need work but he is a rookie after all.   I can see him being the starting pf next season with Simmons being the sf and Joel at the center.  Hes a promising stretch  and if the Sixers can improve the backcourt play and shooting from the backcourt they can have one of the most versatile starting s in the League.As for trading him nope I wouldnt do it.  Guys like Saric are glue guys.  They can do a bit of everything on the floor and are team orientated.   Once the team gets Simmons and Embiid back along with their high first round pick picks hopefully he will be instrumental to the teams success.,sixers,derouce,1,t5_2scmr
11115519,0,t1_dervvx5,Yes theres a winwin scenario. Keep Noel and then trade him after another year of Embiid if he stays healthy. You could then trade him for maybe the same package less of a package take the second rounders out or Anderson or virtually nothing since thats practically what he got anyway. The point is the logic behind the move was retard if he wasnt going to get close to fair value. The better move was to hold off and see if Embiid bounces back from injuries.And Denver made a trade for a better player at the time but it happens that Nurkic flourished lets see if it holds. And using a bad move from another GM as an excuse for ours its just bad rationale.,sixers,derxnxt,-1,t5_2scmr

People were genuinely worried about his career and the amount of ankle surgeries. Once Steph started to reevaluate and got different trainers that focused on building up different parts of his body everything changed.You can say the same for Brook Lopez. He still suffers from the injury prone tag but hes played  full seasons after his foot surgeries. The only time he didnt play was for end of year shutdowns or this year to retain his health for trade value.Embiid can have a long career and I think Philly are doing right by playing the long game and rehabbing him now.,sixers,dfabnuv,1,t5_2scmr

Maybe like  ming since I dont think it would be ideal for longstretches.

11646539,0,t1_dgg55nf,Absolutely. He has some potential and can be at least a solid rotation player for a few years until we need to start paying our big names some big money ,sixers,dgg5did,1,t5_2scmr

11684656,0,t3_66pul1,Man people are really sleeping on Paul George. Hes easily a Top  player in the NBA and borderline Top . His supporting cast in Indiana is terrible. The Pacers are a bottom  team without George.That being said Im not giving up anything for him unless hes guaranteed to resign with the Sixers which is pretty unlikely. But thats really the only reason I wouldnt put together a significant offer for him.People seem to forget that Hinkie initially got the Sixers job because he demonstrated move by move how the Rockets were able to put together an offer for James Harden. Accumulating the ammunition to pull off a deal like this was always one of the possible scenarios of the process  it was all about optionality.I am  open to a move similar to this but given Georges contract situation Im not willing to pull the trigger at really any cost that would be worth it to Indiana.,sixers,dgkh1i0,39,t5_2scmr

11724576,0,t1_dgoz87r,It doesnt matter what Simmons offense role is. Hes going to be guarding forwards and will be guarded by forwards. Hes a forward who happens to be running point. Philly will have two actual guards on the floor who both happen to play off the ball.Just like say Ryan Anderson isnt a shooting guard despite the fact that he mostly just takes threes. ,sixers,dgp0er7,2,t5_2scmr

11769429,0,t3_67xczg,The answer is Doncic and TJ right?,sixers,dgu3git,1,t5_2scmr
11770421,0,t3_67xczg,TJ shooting spot ups at  makes him playable with Simmons. Two play makers like that on one team is so valuable. Thats why Dallas plays like  short ass point guards together because they value the playmaking. ,sixers,dgu7ih2,1,t5_2scmr

11793243,0,t3_6841wt,My main issue with avoiding big external free agents is the fact that there is a window to be had where all these young players are being paid below their market value.Once the team is consistently good there will not be this same opportunity worse young players coming in. I think in order to fully maximize the initial window the team has you have to combine young underpaid star players with star veterans. When SimmonsNewPick reach their first max deal we wont have that space. Ideally they are good enough then to continue playing great and keep the window open but the only way to extend the window is towards earlier and that initial window might even be a stronger team.,sixers,dgwsy7r,2,t5_2scmr
