9643524,0,t1_da1ohel,Ugh that sounds so stressful. Living in that kind of limbo definitely gets to you. My apartment is luckily more s than s haha although the building is from  so everything is concrete no drywall or anything. But its got like half panel and messed up floors and stuff so I just want to get this room finished take a little break and then continue on with the kitchen. My living room had this huuge brick fireplace that spent more energy heating up itself than the room and I had it torn down a few weeks ago and replaced with a more modern wood burning stove so its gonna be super nice to actually be able to use the new one and get some cosy heat from it.Not really sadface just scared D Its soo dark but I just finished that wall and it looks super nice on its own Now I just have to wait until its dry so I can put masking tape on it to get the edges nice and even tomorrow to finish the rest of the walls. Hopefully the end result will be nice and it wont steal too much light.,TeamMeteor,da1rhrk,1,t5_3gvew

If you cant sleep lying down sleep on a comfy chair or at least put a crazy load of pillows under your back. Dont do it for days but it does help me when I reach insanity due to my coughing fits and sleep deprivation. ,TeamMeteor,db3sw9p,2,t5_3gvew
