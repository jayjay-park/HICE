23266,0,t3_1twh2p,Take some time to decide overall which parts youre wanting to be epic and what parts you want to be more functional as a part of the song. It sounds like youre trying to make everything be special which causes confusion within the track. Youve got a great idea going on here but I think if you simplify a few things it will give the track a bit more clarity. I would also take a look at not only layering the horns but changing the sound for the horns when it hits that really low note will help so it doesnt take away from the track. Next dont be afraid to change an idea mid way through the track. Give your track some more depth and expand your ideas. Free up your track to expand beyond the depths of   mins consider . Music doesnt have to be so cookie cutter and can be whatever you like it to be. ,maschine,ceh2ypo,1,t5_2tl6j

9407336,0,t3_598hp9,I got you man.   Ok so you need to setup a MultiOutput device not aggregate and include your audio interface or internal output whatever your source sound is coming out of and soundflower  ch.   Next set soundflower as the master in your new multi output device. And make sure the other one is indeed selected as well so the two devices are working together.    Now go in to maschine software open your preferences and go to audio set your device to soundflower.    Now you have audio being routed from your source through soundflower and your speakers simultaneously while its being recorded through maschines sampler.   Note that when youre done recording your sample you have to change back to your interface as your output device. Hope this helps. ,maschine,d98g27f,2,t5_2tl6j
