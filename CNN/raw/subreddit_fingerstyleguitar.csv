3458448,0,t1_cpmhaph,My nails are hard as well and yes that can cause them to tear away from the bed before the crackbreak.  My problem has been that Krazy Glue pretty much only lasts until my next shower. less than  hours. Doing the baking soda thing really helps to build the nail up so I can play without worry that its going to let go.  Bottom line I still have to watch to make sure I dont do something stupid to tear my fingernail away from the nail bed but if it happens I at least have a shot of salvaging the nail.,fingerstyleguitar,cpmhlhm,1,t5_2scmn

I might have to steal that  eigth note accent pattern for a tune of mine sometime haha.,fingerstyleguitar,d2q6oi8,2,t5_2scmn
