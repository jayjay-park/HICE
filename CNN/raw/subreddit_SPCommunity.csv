2553817,0,t1_cmrilkh,I feel like you dont understand what Im saying.Do you own any albums that have one or more songs that you dont like on them? I know I do but I weigh the songs I dont like versus the songs that I do and Ive decided that most of these albums are worth owning because I like a majority of the songs even if one or two arent great in my eyes.,SPCommunity,cmrx5xk,1,t5_359oq
2575329,0,t1_cmuq6dx,Well in terms of it being the most blatantly conceptual part on the album I love it! Im a big fan of the Machina concept! Now in terms of it as just a song it seems fillery and incredibly pretentious. ,SPCommunity,cmuqfe8,2,t5_359oq

4189279,0,t1_crxrkar,Billy always seems to do the opposite of whats expected of him Id have thought a few songs from MTAE mixed in with the Greatest Hits but who knows?When I saw them in London in  it was pretty much a greatest hits set apart from a block of songs from Oceania played back to back midway through the show.  Billy had a reputation for playing mostly deep cuts and Bsides before then so a run through the hits minus  and anything from Gish surprised me.If you havent brought a ticket yet keep an eye on what the setlists are in the lead up to your show via the Pumpkins forums should give you a good idea of what theyve got rehearsed and ready to perform.,SPCommunity,crxs0q6,3,t5_359oq
4265347,0,t3_39gop8,I love this song as the intro to my favorite album of all time.  The intro of I am One kinda reminds me of to a lesser extent the wall of guitars that hit you in Cherub Rock.  I also think that the dual soloing later in the song is very unique and adds a lot to the song.  People that only know the Pumpkins from  Disarm or Tonight Tonight may not realize it but Billy can definitely shred and I am One showcases his guitar abilities well.  As for his singing in this song and the rest of Gish I would have to say I enjoy it more than his usual way of singing though I enjoy both.  In Gish he sings a lot less harshly than he does later which I think really contributes to the dreamy psychedelic feel of the album showcased in songs like Crush and Rhinoceros.  All in all I think this song does a good job of giving the listener an idea of what to expect with Gish but I probably wouldnt play it to get someone new to the Pumpkins to like them just because it is so different than a majority of their work.,SPCommunity,cs6f85u,3,t5_359oq
