10546715,0,t1_dd20s0m,Im not keen to give any firm dates as it depends mainly on my kids. The bulk of the update is complete and Im just bug testing at this point. Im also ensuring the Current HQM stuff works. Given how much of a pain that is to work with that might take a few days. I hope to push this update in next week or two and then have an update or two to follow with some nonessential content.  If you are thinking of moving to this update I can whitelist you to see dev pack. You can see if the changes justify reset. If you go that route you could start pregenerating with beta as the worldgen is complete barring some unexpected bug. ,Technode,dd3l6gj,2,t5_2zj6e
