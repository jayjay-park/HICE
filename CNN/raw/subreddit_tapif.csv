11462104,0,t1_dfv7qt2,I was a freshoutofhighschool  year old when I went over there. I loved it. I can genuinely say that it was the best year of my life hence the reason Im trying to go back!!. I did do a lot of babysitting as a teenager so I had experience but I had friends over there without much childcare experience. One thing I will say is that it is very emotionally taxing to live with your employers. Some au pairs get lucky and the family has a separate apartment or outbuilding for them. Id try for one of those positions. Paris would be a good place to look for that. ,tapif,dfv80id,1,t5_2zspb

11556018,0,t1_dg5u5b0,I applied to TAPIF and BEDA as well plus the ministry program in Spain. Im in an oppisite situation as you because Ive studied French and know french culture and barely speak Spanish. I was admitted but not placed in the ministry program so if I dont get into TAPIF and get into BEDA it will be a tough choice. But if I get into TAPIF Im going to do it because Ive studied frenchFrance and really want to experience living in France and improve my french and Ive heard overall better things about the program. Id be struggling for sure in Spain but I think I could do it if it came to that!,tapif,dg5vmy1,2,t5_2zspb
