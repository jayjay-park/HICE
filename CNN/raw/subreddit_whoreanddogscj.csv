9352842,0,t1_d91j9fv,Succesful stun gt heal. Why take damage in the first place. Why risk an NP in the face? Oh wait you decrease enemy gauge already for that. Every  turns for  turns turn enemy damage to ticklish and you wont even need heals in the first place too pair him with Mashu and you get something better than TeamNeverDie WaverJeanneTamamoIriMedeaLily called TeamNeverGetDamaged which can also have someone else placed in the team to actually deal damage to enemies.Plus we are going off topic here.

Kaminas going to eavesdrop do it outside of the team doesnt get an AMAZING fucking finale Im just mad. If Holo had broken down in tears when she realized that he needed an exterminator knowing full well who and what you did makes you a mistake of reality in his realization that maybe he can be surprisingly badass when shes human? Kizunaiver Wasnt terrible but the rewards were still an unknown.
