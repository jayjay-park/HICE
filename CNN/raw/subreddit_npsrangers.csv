10305732,0,t1_dcbyqrd,Well Im moving out there on my own dime so I doubt theyll reimburse me but maybe when taxes are due I can use it.LOL I know.  Later in the day yesterday I told myself really the only thing stressing me out is finding a place to live.  Ive moved out to AK before on short notice and it wasnt that bad.  In fact I got there early lol I kind of laughed at myself for stressing out.  I mean if I decide not to do it or they need someone earlier than I can get there then oh well.  Ive applied for other seasonal jobs in AK and will hope to get those.  I dont know why I was stressing so much LOL,npsrangers,dcc7kl4,2,t5_2ze9j
