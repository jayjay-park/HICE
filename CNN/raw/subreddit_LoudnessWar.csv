10693712,0,t3_5i67ux,New attempt. Mike Posner  Cooler Than Me legally downloaded from qobuz.comThis time I did  attempts. One with Audition as usual and one with Audacity using the Dual LinkwitzRiley Filters instead of Auditions FFT filter. Results were very close. I screwed up a bit on the midrange but thats because I was careless not because of the VST filter. When performing this kind of process prefer doing it on headphones rather than speakers preferably good headphones not cheap ones as they tend to mask possible artefacts caused by the process.The main problem with external VST filters as opposed to Adobe Auditions builtin FFT filter is that they add a variable delay depending on the frequency band youre working on. So you always have to find the delay by yourself and writing it down if performing the filter a second time.Suggested frequency bands Dominion and GGate settingsLows Hz Dominion attack level at  GGate threshold at Lower mids Hz Dominion attack level at  GGate threshold at Higher mids Hz Dominion attack level at  GGate threshold at Highs Hz Dominion attack level between  and  GGate threshold at Heres a more detailed description of what I did in Audacity. You must have  duplicated tracks of your working frequency band. One on which you will apply Dominion and one with only the Dual LinkwitzRiley filter applied in addition to a track of the original song untouched with only its volume reduced. For the moment you only have one track with your song and one track on which you applied your filter. Dont duplicate it yet. You must find out how much delay it added to your track compared to the original song. Dont hesitate to zoom in very closely in order to observe waveforms of both the filtered track and the original song. Once you found out an obvious spot you can delete the quantity of samples that are needed on the filtered track. Both should line up perfectly. Once its lined up you can duplicate this Dual LinkwitzRiley filter track for later. Apply Dominion on the first Dual LinkwitzRiley track and delete  samples at the beginning. Invert the second Dual LinkwitzRiley track. Now merge both the effected track and the filteredonly one. Now if the delay previously found was correct only expanded loud parts should remain. Now you can apply GGate on this track and repeat this process for another frequency band. Dont hesitate to apply a second Dual LinkwitzRiley after gating for increased transparency but youll have to cancel out its delay again by the same amount as before.Obviously using Audacity instead of Audition proves more cumbersome for this process but yields very good results. If you want to full freeware route this is the way to go.I posted second samples at the hydrogenaud.io forums,LoudnessWar,ddiz6r8,1,t5_31ccr
