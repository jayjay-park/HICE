Home Depot has much more policies in place to not only fix these errors but to placate customers whom are upset. Your friend was under no contract or obligation to purchase anything from Home Depot. Your friend instead settled for something they didnt want by someone they didnt like and are now complaining about it on social media which will garner support from people who already dont like Home Depot.

Our current DH is moving to another department and a current team member is replacing him. In addition another part timer is moving to garden and I know at least one guy is getting fired shortly. Weve only taken on one temp for the spring rush so we are losing  people overall. Were running about  people a night currently with the DH calling us in early or on days off if needed. Im hoping for at least one temp that can keep up with those of us who take our job requirements seriously and not just half ass it.Im not sure how packdown works whether they have them during the day as well or if we just do it when we can.

If you quit or are fired THD can and does cancel payouts. weve just gone over this with  people who quit for different reasons.

I realize that might seem ridiculous to you or some contractors might complain and give you shit about it but all i can say is FUCK THEM.... you only have one back my friend make sure you take care of it! I dont care how strong you are but you really should be very careful when lifting those bags if the customer doesnt want to help and theyre buying  bags or more use the FORKLIFT... Just get one of the guys from building and lumber and theyll be more than happy to help you out and always remember to make sure youre back is not ROUNDED...meaning you have to maintain that natural arch in your lower back when lifting that we all have...If you dont youll run into a lot of back problems...Ive was doing barbell training and gymnastics since I was in high school and I blew out my back in less than  year because I didnt follow this advice...

In my experience the person we hired as a head cash from outside was on a register for the first few weeks  this allowed her to learn the systemcircumstances etc. I dont think you can be effective without knowing the system.

The day the Freight team starts decontaminating my electrical fittings PVC boxes PVC fittings metal boxes outdoor boxes breakers wiring devices dimmers etc. is the day I focus on freight. If I know a class is hurting Ill sort through the silver carts and pull that specific class freight.  But Im not going to have myself or my guys spend  hours of the available working day concentrating on freight when we have an overnight freight team and day shift has tasking in the aisles that needs to get done.  After a good weekend itll take  hours to recover bulbs.  Itll take  hours to recover wiring devices.  And these arent the only classes that take this long to recover.

9746564,0,t1_dae2022,tedious routine gripeTheres plenty of accountability for not getting  hours of labor done in a section given  employeehours of actual pay in a day.  Working with a spotter requires twice the number of people that not working with a spotter requires.  Quite often even in a large store like mine management will do things like schedule one person to open and expect them to do heavy packdown from a reach from  and expect them to get it done damnit.  I doubt any store follows procedures for gates at night and Ive heard more than one person express incredulity about the rule existing  Respecting it in my corner of the store would mean doubling staffing and still slowing down freight because every gate is an impediment for someone else that needs to be moved out of the way or set back up afterwards.Unlike a lot of people I am fully capable of being a stickler and memorizing the SOP and following it religiously  I am enthusiastic about fulfilling whatever duties there are and I have a legalistic mindset I blame an upbringing rich in videogames.  But I see everyone around me pressured to work quickly enough stockingcleaningsetting that they are unable to follow SOP.  Including the people that are training me to follow SOP.  I see my prospect of insisting on SOP being not only unwelcome but actively disrupting store veterans.  I see people that expect me to finish a safety checklist in  minutes to get to the actual work while the safety checklist wants me to circle the department for an hour.  Tell me to do one thing with one side of your mouth and tell me to do something contradictory with the other and I have to pick something to violate.If Atlanta didnt want it set up this way Atlanta wouldnt incentivize ASMs and SMs to cut hours so deep or expect so much.  The cynical take is that they just need to ritually fire someone every so often to pretend to care.  The less cynical take is that theyre not expecting perfection this is just an ideal model like a building code and ASMs will flesh out what actually matters via selective enforcement and experience and if your building actually falls down someone will be strung up but otherwise....One store veteran recently Dont worry so much man.
