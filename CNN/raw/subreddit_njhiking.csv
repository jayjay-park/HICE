11733931,0,t1_dgprddu,Would you be happy if people were trying to prevent you from hiking there? I dont think you would. Try to look at it from their point of view.list of parks Jorba already do work in  Go examine the parks for yourself.  I personally think they help more than just bikers. They clear debris mark trails and when they build they try and take water flow into consideration.  They are not just some hooligans in the woods shoveling dirt around. ,njhiking,dgq2kb4,2,t5_2shj3
