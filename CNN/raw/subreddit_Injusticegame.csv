688168,0,t1_cgieh5q,Ok well if he gets killed once and comes back hes just gonna get killed again. I dont know Ive had this argument too many times. I dont firmly believe goku couldnt beat superman but DBZ is so so so inconsistent with its power levels and capabilities that I also dont understand how you could firmly believe goku could beat him. Like right off the bat freeza destroys a planet. Then Goku makes a remark about how Cell a stronger being that freeza will destroy the planet if he fires his kamehameha into the ground. And then Gohan and cell clash kamehamehas and theres almost zero damage to the ground. I think there may have been a small crater but nothing else. And whats weirder still is that kid buu blows up the planet and Goku and Vegeta together dont even try to block it or deflect it. Even after both of them have probably doubled their power  times since the Cell fight. A planet destroying blast is now somehow completely outside of their blocking capacity. It just doesnt make sense.,Injusticegame,cgihvii,1,t5_2vo7i

1055134,0,t3_266ujb,Deathstroke really isnt that big of a problem. No offense but it sounds like youre just salty. Go play Mahvel and deal with constant lvl  X factor Vergils or Blazblue pre nerf Kokonoe. Deathstroke can be a pain but his character design is fine and fits perfectly. If he is constantly running away that gives you time to setup your offensedefense. There are characters in this game that are designed worse than DS by a long shot. ,Injusticegame,cho823i,3,t5_2vo7i

3549909,0,t1_cpwtmbu,OK thank you.If you dont mind I hope you may help clarify using the video above as a guide.At  seconds in DD is on the left side of Catwoman having just jumped from the right side and successfully performed his J.At  seconds DD is in the air again performing his J just as Catwoman is getting up. So at that point since the attack is coming from right side you should block right i.e. hold left.And then immediately follow by blocking low from the same direction right?Its hard for me to understand where I am going wrong as I did spend time in practice mode before posting. I havent had to ask for help in overcoming a type of spam so far until now.Its probably a bit much to ask but is there any chance you could share a video of Lex beating out that DD spam? I might have a better idea of what I am doing wrong if I see someone doing ti right.If not thank you for the advice and I will spend more time practicing that along with what sacreddj suggested.edit this video    shows Batman being able to block the spam and I was able to do it with Zod. I just havent been able to do it with Lex as every time the character is still getting up he gets clipped.I guess I need to block sooner than I have been assuming..,Injusticegame,cpwwv9l,1,t5_2vo7i
