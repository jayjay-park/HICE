3800228,0,t3_33y5nh,Last year I emailed the student activities department my portfolio because I was dissatisfied with their atrocious designs though of course I didnt tell them that and they gave me a job! Its not terribly thrilling and Ive come to realize how disorganized my college is but its been fantastic practice and its very satisfying to get paid for it. Im not proud of everything Ive made but I think Ive come along way. Ive gotten a lot of positive feedback from my campus but I wanted to know what other designer type folk think. ,idesignedthis,cqpgf6c,2,t5_2txi0

4377849,0,t1_cpz3hb8,I think the top left one with scissors and barber pole is brilliant. Fix the kerning and clean up the pole where its broken in half so it doesnt look like a white box was pasted over it. You can barely see stripes starting on the inside. Tighten it up maybe?After that Id say you have a solid logotype whichpresumably on the side of a truckwill work great!The sansserif geometric typeface definitely communicates the modernity of a driving barber shop. A black letter logotype as a callback to travelling caravanssalesmen in feudal times would have been clever but making black letter sufficiently legible at a distance might have been difficult. I think the choice for a modern typeface seems sound and works in this case.,idesignedthis,csj4aus,1,t5_2txi0

10826047,0,t1_ddwmddt,Well the process was mainly just making small adjustments for a very prolonged period of time until I was happy with it! It was a very free brief from the guy from the record company it simply had to have SOMETHING to do with music I was thinking along the lines of Music of the Sphere a stretch I know.I also really dig the kinds of illustrations with that grainy type of shading and Ive had been meaning to develop a way of my own of creating that kind of effect. I ended up creating the shapes with a gradient meshes and then overlaying it with a noise mask.Like I said with this project it was a very free exercise and there was not much a of a structured creative process!,idesignedthis,ddwmpdx,1,t5_2txi0
