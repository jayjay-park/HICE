3017182,0,t3_2upegc,The peak times can vary and you may have to adapt to the most popular game type to find a match more easily.You can add varying game types via PlaygtMatch MakinggtAdd Item button.Your best best is to queue for the match type you want to play like v or  vs ai. Then you can add Scrimmage game types to play to pass the time. So you can do like a v or v while waiting for your v to pop. On top of this you can either go to ProfilegtHeroes and Try Hero or PlaygtCustom Games to make a custom game against golemsbots. When a game is ready from these modes you will be able to join then and there. Hope this helps!,SinsOfaDarkAge,coaq91s,1,t5_2uo02
