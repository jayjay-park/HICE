204844,0,t3_1wgp61,nulling a variableIf its a variable intended to hold an object you can use noone which is a GML constant corresponding to . Then before you do operations you can check if object  noone but if you dont have it deactivated instanceexists will work too provided it was set to noone.instanceexistsnoone will turn up false but instanceexists will actually return true usually because  is often the object ID of something you are using in your engine.EditsHowever this doesnt fix your problem.In your example chipPrize is the object ID NOT the instance ID. This means that you are going to change the variable for all instances of the object instead of just the one that you created.So instead you will need to set temp  instancecreate... and then change the direction of temp. After that there should be no need to set it to noone.Bonus QuestionYou need to have drawing in the draw event or else it wont do anything. When you left click you can specify a variable and then check it to draw or you can just directly check the left click inside of the draw event via GML.,gamemaker,cf1rxg9,4,t5_2qw2g

The cheerful music and graphics create a nice mood I can think of the following two improvements I dont like the delay that makes you unable to flip for a short while after flipping. That delay is frustrating and in combination with the current level randomizer can also cause you to end up in situations that are unbeatable. If you think the game is too easy without the delay then perhaps there is some other way of making it more challenging. Add Google play services so that people can compare their scores to that of their friends and also to the global leaderboard.

Fact is that much of the artwork for the first one is highly repetitive. You say there is x amount of artwork in this one. Id rather you say x amount of artwork with x amount variations. Was the price I paid worth it? Yes because I got it at the discounted kickstarter price. However I wouldnt tell anyone to buy the first one because of the issues I have with it.

But the space in between the frames is static. Therefor a  fps game scale nicely because it can hold the frame for hz or hz updates of the monitor. If you have a game running  fps you end up having one frame showing for  of a second and the next saying for  of a second. Its not that big of a deal in the end but it is nice to have all the frames show the same amount of time.Technologies like gsync are being made to enable a dynamic update rates on monitors but are not that wide spreed and is jet to see the implementation on a phone.,gamemaker,chv8qzg,1,t5_2qw2g

1863142,0,t1_ckdeh5u,Right so in most of my examples I talk about using a single rooms and generating the tiles inside those rooms. This concept can be moved to a bigger scale to give you exactly what you want. Imagine that each room is actually just a really detailed tile. Now you can come up with rules for which tile room is the starting tile and which one is the finish and how you get there  ect.The trick to BoI is that each room is premade might want to read up a bit here its a really good read.All that the BoI generation code does is define a path through rooms with a few rules. rules like This is the room you start in. or this is the floor youre on so only pick from rooms from that floor.It creates a D array or dsgrid that contains very simple information about the rooms. it might keep track of the name of the room and weather or not it has been cleared yet. in the case of BoI it also keeps track of if the room has been seen and if it has any consumables in it.moving around that grid can be a bit more difficult. In the past you could use a neat trick with executestring to make room names based on a grid but now that function has been removed so you need to be a bit less creative.you would save the ID of the room to the grid or array then when youre moving between rooms you would have to look up that x and y on the array. then just go to that room.,gamemaker,ckdpbqd,2,t5_2qw2g

The xscaling also stopped at the same time which left a gap between the bullet and line equivalent to the bullets speed.

Last couple days have been mostly cleaning up and optimizing the code but today I did reach the pretty major milestone of making it completely possible to draw multiple consecutive lines of text in a single object which is trickier than it sounds because of all the variables involved that cant interfere with each other from string to string.Future plans involve adding more markup such as a ref tag for clickable text which some visual novels use to link to a glossary entry for example text log for when you accidentally click through something too fasthate when that happens auto continue and of course all the fancy graphics like backgrounds and prompt icons and animated character cutins.

You could also make it so the turn radius is never less than whats required for a corner. Maybe add some jumps? you could just increase the size of the sprite to make it look like its going higher up closer to the camera and take away control from the player and add some of your own basic physics. Have some things going over the track like banners or walkways to give the game some depth. Separate collision masks for things like trees so you can drive behind them.

A lack of any struct construction is one that frustrates me. The inability to create clean slate objects and classes without the extra baggage attached to them such as rotation sprite and many other variables that arent neccessary that only further add to the already bloated memory needs.The lack of typed variables is a big thing that would save many headaches for many people. It also breeds shitty habits for newcomers to programming.An old complaint was that the debugger was... fucking trash to say the least.

New Taste enemy tongue sprites.  Main character emits sparkles. Light emitted from main character is now bluish and originates properly from the body instead of the shadow.Screenshot  Blood from enemies can stain the main character. The more blood the deeper the red. The UVs for the blood overlay are randomized for each facing direction similar to the randomization of Spindas spots in Pokemon Screenshot  Random room partitioning using the recursive division algorithm Used for generating random levels for those days when I dont feel like doing level design.

It is okay to have friends and family vote.Two straight s were given to your game by users who did not rate any other game nor did they write anything in their comment. Does that seem fair to you? It doesnt seem that way to us so we removed them which unfortunately meant for you that your game has a lower standing than it did before.

3918078,0,t3_358tlp,Your .ini files generally should be created dynamically from code rather than being precreated. Not only will this place them in the working directory but if something happens to the file it will be recreated automatically when the game runs. Otherwise without this functionality the game will crash if you rely on files that may or may not be there. Read up on the ini files commands in the documentation.If you do want to start out with a .zip though you can make your .zip file add it to the games Included Files folder and then when the game runs execute the zipunzip command to extract the contents.The tricky thing to keep in mind with all this is your game technically has two working directoriesa readonly directory and a writable directory. The place where the game is executed from is a readonly directory to GameMaker meaning if you put an ini next to your executable the game can read from it but it cannot write to it. If the game tries to write to that ini file what it will actually do is create a copy elsewhere in the writable directory. On Windows this directory is either in CUsersYOURUSERAppDataLocal or CUsersYOURUSERAppDataRoaming you can set which directory to use in Game Settings.Thus Id most strongly recommend just generating your ini files from code to begin with. That way the game wont crash over them missing you wont have to worry about managing directories yourself and the ini files will end up in an AppData folder that the user probably wont see.,gamemaker,cr2wanf,1,t5_2qw2g
3987054,0,t3_364s9n,From the docs on eventinheritedNormally when an instance has a parent object it automatically inherits all the same events as the parent but if for example your parent object has a create event and you add one to your child object all instances of the child object will run the new create event that you have added and not that which is in the parent object.Child objects will automatically run their parents events the point of using eventinherited is so that you can use the parent event AND your own code. If you dont want a child object to use its parents event create an event there of its own. You can just have it run exit or something if it really needs a code block there to register.,gamemaker,crarcue,1,t5_2qw2g

4108961,0,t1_croabc9,Well the method is kind of bold and somehow remind me of an old trick used on ancient computers thinking expanding the number of showable colors on Atari ST here  which is a good point for you in my opinionHere the limitation youre trying to overcome with a trick isnt one of the machine but of yourself. I believe its perfectly ok as long as the limitations of your very method arent too bad. So your baby processor doesnt suffer from it but  having more lasers going than just the one may deal more cost to the processor the big drawback with your method lies in its lack of precision stopping and various places in front of a block depending on where your start point is.Just those details should justify to try to delve more into other yes more conventional ways.

Love it.One thing I did notice was that the target respawns too closely to the spike. Basically right in the center of it.What I would suggest is to make it progressively harder. Which it as I understand already is but make it even simpler in the beginning. Because I died almost immediately several times in a row and it made me feel cool game cool idea but too hard for me.I guess the balance is important here not too hard not too easy.I think if you want to make it addictive Id say  jumps should be very easy. Once the player has performed an action successfully several times in a row now they have momentum and investment. The investment bias says that the more time and energy someone has invested into something the more they will keep investing.So get them hooked with skill control   and then keep them engaged with challenge arousal.,gamemaker,csk3a83,1,t5_2qw2g

4630082,0,t1_ctdvngg,It depends on what youre doing.For example Im currently making a turn based strategy game with an isometric view.The origin of the objects that comprise the map grid little isometric diamond squares is the center pixel of the top most row of the sprite.For anything that goes on the squares the origin is where that same spot on the grid they occupy.This does two things.  It ensures that things are properly aligned on the grid when they move to a particular square.  Everything is using essentially the same point of reference when they determine their depth using depth  y with slight modifications as the situation demands.So where the origin is if you do your planning right will more or less be game specific and have some good reasoning behind where its placed.  Some games it honestly doesnt really matter so long as you can still slap together levels with it but its generally a good idea to have a method to your madness.,gamemaker,cte6y29,1,t5_2qw2g

In example when you break a vase and want its pieces to linger around this could cause a massive drop of your performance if theres lot of breakable stuff. So when those pieces have stopped moving you could draw them on the surface and then destroy the pieceinstance!If you want your footsteps to stay on the field just draw them on the surface as you walk.Sprites you cant change that easily but with surface you can do anything you want to. Its like... MSPaint! A canvas where you draw what ever you want. Performs pretty good if you keep it small!

My question is this.  When making a game I often feel discouraged by how much stuff I have to look up while getting into the game.  Whereas when learning C or C I was able to grasp concepts and quickly recall them for use later.  In Gamemaker I have to look up a LOT of stuff.  Collision movement jumping all that stuff.  Ive done it in a few different small one room games and still during my bigger project need to look up how to do it or reference the GML documentation or online tutorials.In Farons Fate did you find yourself looking up documentation  tutorials more than just doing stuff by memory?I know its probably an odd question thank you.,gamemaker,cwciq3z,1,t5_2qw2g

5767251,0,t1_cxbfm39,Good thought but but I highly suggest against this approach. You actually dont have a guarantee this will ever finish running and it will likely take considerably longer than expected. Try doing  to  with a random number generator by hand. Youll quickly find that when you get a repeat number you go through the entire list. More importantly as you have more numbers in the list the more times you have to go through the entire list. The best runtime you can ever get is n which isnt bad but your worst runtime is near infinity depending on your algorithm.  Itll work where you need a small number compared to the n options but I still advise against because that one run a player may wait  minutes for a load vs  second.,gamemaker,cxbzb6l,1,t5_2qw2g

5781353,0,t1_cxdpt2g,Ill break it down a little bit more. You should probably have a control object that handles all global variables etc. but for explainings sake you could just do it in the player object.Player game start    global.checkpointX      global.checkpointY      lives    you should probably have  as a variable just in case you want to do something with that later onEdit Actually now that I think about it checkpointX and Y dont necessarily have to be global unless something that isnt the player does something with the checkpoints. Oh well do whatever you want with them.Player collision event with checkpoint    checkpointX  other.x    checkpointY  other.yCreate an object and name it something like parentenemy then set that as the parent for all of your enemy objects.Player collision event with enemy parent    lives   or lives  a damage variable in case you want the player to lose more than one life    x  checkpointX    y  checkpointYThat should work. Basically what this is doing is setting a global variable to the X and Y of the last checkpoint the player has touched and if the player touches an enemy they will go back to the last checkpoint. This is again a really basic way to do it but its a good start. If anything goes wrong let me know!,gamemaker,cxdqcn5,1,t5_2qw2g

Have you noticed that when you write code theres this neat thing on the bottom of the code editor that shows you a little help on each function you type? Like for example when you typed pointinrectangle it shows pointinrectanglepx py x y x y? Lets add one of those for our script!    sfxplaysound    var sfxindex  argument    if pointinrectanglex y viewxview viewyview viewxview  viewwview viewyview  viewhview         audioplaysoundsfxindex    Now every time you call this script it will show sfxplaysound on the bottom of the code editor so you dont forget how to use it.Okay now you can call the script from within one of your objects. Select an object on your project and replace the action youre using to play the sound with an Execute Code action from the Control tab on the object where you want to play the sound. Inside of that action youll write the following line of code    sfxplayyour soundwhere your sound is the name of the sound you want to play of course PNow youve written your first script. Where to go next? Ill suggest writing on GML stuff youve already done on drag and drop. Open up the GMS documentation it has everything you need. You can access it by pressing F anywhere on the program. You can also open documentation on specific functions and things by pressing the middle button on what you want to consult.I hope this writeup helps you!,gamemaker,cy1xa9m,1,t5_2qw2g

Hasnt been for some time now.Most of the indie and dev related subreddits are in a similar slump.People make games to follow a passion sure but they also make them hoping to make money.  To make a career for themselves.All these subreddits are so far up their own asses theyve considered damn near everything to be selfpromotional in an industry where most of us hope to make it alone or in small teams where weve got no damn choice but to be selfpromotional!Sure we dont want people spamming useless crap.  We dont want people endlessly posting and reposting about the game theyve put into an early access Greenlight tailspin that will inevitably result in the games cancellation.But what the hell is the point of being involved in a game development community that constantly shits on the very idea of sharing the things were developing!Ive been saying to myself for months that I might as well unsubscribe from most of those cesspools that nothing of value has come out of them in damn near a year simply because the subreddits themselves dont allow anything of value.Its all also probably got something to do with the rise of these Indie Game Promoters and Indie Game Marketers who are happy to get in a contract for  of your games profits because they have the connections to get a game featured on an article which will somehow make the cut for these ridiculous subreddits as fair game and not selfpromotional.,gamemaker,cytt9ns,2,t5_2qw2g

6286340,0,t1_cz3zhry,Just taking a quick look at the code you just added and it looks like you have your code referring to the wrong thing. If the code you wrote is in the creation code of the room just following the flow it is checking if an object exist which came true since you probably had the object in the room. Then you have set a variable value to . The problem with that is that I believe its still referring within the bounds of the creation code. Meaning you would have to put value   in the creation code. But that would be pointless since thats not the value you want to change. You want to change the value in that particular object in this case ObjNumber. Havent tested it in my free time but what you can do is refer to that object by using with. So for example     ifinstanceexistsObjNumberchecks if its in room           withObjNumber within ObjNumber                             everything between the brackets are now referring to ObjNumber                value   set the variable value in ObjNumber to                  or you can access it again like you did before with an accessor    ifinstanceexistsObjNumber            ObjNumber.value      This is more so to replace that second piece of code you showed in your post to connect it to the object. Hope that helped some what. Seems like it was just a scope issue.

6435131,0,t3_43llr6,I am currently using GMS to develop a hybrid text adventureotomevisual novel game with some features of an rpgadventure game. Before settling on GMS I tried a variety of engines to see what would be a best balance of executing all of the features I was looking for while providing an easy workflow of a time saving engine. While I love GM for creating action event games I loathe using GM for any heavy text based games. If I didnt have the extra elements that I needed to implement than I would definitely use Tyrano Builder hands down the easiest engine for game making I have seen it allows for complete customization and nails any of the features someone developing a dialog heavily game would want but it is geared towards text and adventure games so if I wanted to add say a mini game that involves platformer style mechanics in the middle of my text game that would be impossible.If I was doing just a text based game but also interested in something more powerful and advanced than Twine I would choose Tyrano Builder. It is only  dollars on steam you can make as many executable as you like with no extra licensing fees you can execute to different builds like pc or android for instance free once again you do not have to worry about paying extra after that . They also provide some very nice royalty free assets that can act as nice place holders while you begin building your game. The interface is very intuitive with everything very straightforwardclean simple but overall the engine is very powerful in creating a feature rich text game. You can create a dynamic interactive fiction game within hours with the drag and drop system you also have the ability to use scripting if you would like to. The drag and drop features control text clickable buttons which the engine can make for you and they look very modern and nice or you can upload your own sprites selectable areas it breaks up branches as easy as Inklewriter or Twine and it also has the following features variables sprites and character control options where you can store all the expressions of a character i.e happy angry and easily switch between one expression to the other simply by clicking and dragging a change expression event the engine also allows you to adjust the duration of a sprites expression which in turn can produce complex animations within a minute like blinking or talking screen effects like quake and transitions the ability to add movies and sound. They begin you with a demo game with everything you need to start your game built for you and all you have to do is change the sprites or tweak the functions to your liking or you can start with a blank game. It took me less than ten minutes to grasp everything and from there I built a pretty sweet game in like  hours. I also am fond of the easy to follow tutorials and helpful community they have as it was released I believe recently they are constantly updating it with even more features. haha after writing this short story about it I might just say F it and go with Tyrano builder minigames be damned just so I can suffer less.,gamemaker,czkxifp,1,t5_2qw2g

In terms of loading perroom versus loading at the start Id go by the following heuristic Things that will be used in all rooms can be loaded at the start and retained. Things that will only be used in one room and arent huge can be loaded at the start and retained. Huge data items that are only used in one room can be loaded for that specific room.Bear in mind that huge is relative and depends on a bunch of things.

Now think of the rooms in order from left to right we have  rooms. The top left most room is room . The one to the right is  and so on until we get  in the next section.So what you could do is use a dsmap lets call it dsmap.occupied to populate the rooms that are occupied in order from gt in this case because our total field is . So their key would be  and their value would either be true or false.Then to to check if a room is occupied below the room you are currently in you just changed the checkvariable you are using through to map to see if your current rooms numberfieldwidth is occupied. To check above you do the same but fieldwidth. To check to the right . To the left .In cases where you are up against a barrier ie in rooms numbered  you could do one of two things. Either you could create a wider shell of rooms around those ones OR you could have it do checks with the rounding functions to make sure it never crosses.I got this to work in the movement system for my SRPG you should be able to figure something out as well...,gamemaker,d1ooocq,2,t5_2qw2g

They have the same name of the variable and use the same object they just have different values and each instance of the same object keep tracks of their own values.You do this on collision events so each one have their own value when the frames are colliding.,gamemaker,d21u8of,1,t5_2qw2g

Negatives Color functionality is not as intuitive on a keyboard as it is using a controller.Opinions Not a lot to keep bringing me back for additional plays.

One workaround I have found to avoid having to manually add a bunch of repeated objects I create an object with a draw event.  I scale the object to fill the space where I want the Sprite to be drawn as tiled.  In the draw event have a repeat loop for xscale and yscale drawing the intended Sprite that many times.  So even though its a single object it appears as a repeated tile.  I also use this for platforms and the code automatically draws a different tile on the left and right side and fills in the center.  This way the tedium of drawing separate tiles in the editor is avoided.  It is quite nice and I assume it saves processor some work as it has only one object rather than !I can see this system being extended to draw an entire map in tiles using scripts or included files such as xml from an external editor.  ,gamemaker,d2zphbt,3,t5_2qw2g

8077519,0,t3_4pq0cb,Ode To CavesA TurnBased RPG inspired by the Paper Mario and Mother series weeks have passed since my first Screenshot Saturday. I dont have a team of people its just me but in that time much progress has been made today I will be showing some screens of how the art has been revised after last time showing you earlier designs.This is where you can see screenshots for the game.In this specific screen you can see there is a ZAxis.Here you can see Im poking fun at how in typical RPGs when you talk to people you stand right in their face. In this game you need to give people some space.I will now explain the game below.In Ode To Caves you do not play as the main characters of the world rather you select your own group from a wide cast of characters. I want players to have the freedom of forming their own story by making decisions and creating relationships through their favorite characters. There is a heavy focus on Groups. You play as the leader of your group taking your friends into battle. If you do not fit the role of a proper leader you will need to learn or risk being overturned by your group or abandoned. The character you chose is important as some people just arent compatibile with some.Battles in the game are also revolved around the group leaders have commands to control the party. Enemies may also have leaders Group battles can become intense when so many people are involved.There is PermaDeath your characters cannot live forever and depend on your leadership.Im really excited sharing these small details and i cant wait until I can show you more but I have to reserve myself for now.

If you move the view to the bottom right corner the topleft corner is at position  in the room so when you put drawtextviewxview viewyview it can also be read as drawtext .Hopefully this helped and wasnt too rambly but it is right before lunch so my train of thought isnt running as smoothly as Id like.,gamemaker,d54gxvo,1,t5_2qw2g

If you want to preserve what you drew then you shouldnt clear it at all.Consequently using drawclearalpha with an alpha value of  makes the color irrelevant because its already fully transparent.

8516870,0,t1_d665579,While you could make a launcher to automatically update it it wouldnt be worth it.  Imagine running an exe but deleting the file its running on.  Its too risky so youd have to use another program besides the get file function is for downloading community maps or text files for some other functionality I have yet to explore.  Im not aware of any other third party programs for creating a auto downloader I guess you could just make another game maker game that downloads for the first game maker game.  Really the biggest problem is that I havent seen anyone else do it.  No one really makes downloaders for their games.  If its a small project it really isnt that worth it to make such an expansive project like a downloader and if its really for bug testing builds or sharing with friends the best way is for them to just download the game from better websites besides youd need a pro version of Dropbox or some dedicated file hoster for an auto downloader which makes them really not worth the cost.  Game maker devs havent really used auto updaters because theyre really not worth it unless you specifically want to avoid larger and better updaters like steam or itch.io.  So you are right in theory you could make a second game maker game to update your game.  But it wouldnt be worth it and it would be hella untrustworthy your unlicenced downloader downloading unknown files would get blasted by other users unless they knew your trustworthiness in person.  Downloading games off of third party isnt that bad.  Ive done it for  years as a high schooler dev Im sure it wont be that bad before you get the game on steam or a third party platform.Edit What I meant to mean by the fact I havent seen another game maker dev use the  is that I havent seen it used often by larger devs.  That doesnt mean that you cant be the first once to do it.  Dont let my lack of utility for this function get you down because Im sure if you put some elbow grease into that program you could get it to work.  ,gamemaker,d6662n6,2,t5_2qw2g

8607971,0,t3_4xq29d,The problem here is that its going to get a bit more complicated than it might seem on the surface. For example I see you used assetgetindex. Thats fine for retrieving the index number of the object from your resource tree in GMs IDE. However an object resource does not contain variables while an INSTANCE of that object does. Once you attempt to grab an instance of that object youre going to have to do some conversion along the way. I would assume it would look something like this. The user types in an expected object resource name.. You convert that string to an object resource index number using assetgetindex. You run a with construction through all active instances in your room to determine their resource index. I imagine this would use some combination of objectindex objectgetname and assetgetindex. Compare the user entered index with the index of each instance run through using the with construction. If there is a match you can now gather the instance id by returning the variable id. This can be saved into your array to refer back to that specific instance later. However if there is more than one instance of this object things get trickier. Youll need an additional step here to filter if you so require. For now Im skipping that.. Now you can use another with construction to access that specific index using the id you saved into your array earlier. Array should be holding the id which would be a real number that stores the exact index of the instance. You can now compare the user input for the variable to change and affect a specific variable that way. You will not be able to refer directly to a variable by storing it into the array because the value will be duplicated not reflected into the instance. This means your if else conditions or switch statements could get lengthy.    with array         if stringarray  name             name  stringarray         else if stringarray  level             level  array            OR    with array         switch stringarray             case name    name  stringarray                            break            case level   level  array                            break            If you want to directly run scripts without having to preplan for each and every condition youll have to use a Game Maker version older than Studio use version  or . In these older versions there was a function called executestring that would allow you to run a line of code exactly as written as if it were GML that was hardcoded into the game except its running at realtime. This could be run based off user input or loaded from an external file.

9043784,0,t1_d7ymbl8,This was interesting at first I dont think Ive seen a game like it before.  But it quickly got boring  after about the nd level I felt like Id seen everything there was to it and there wasnt much sense of progress.  I played through  levels but it felt like I was playing the same level over and over.  And while you could say that about idle clicker games with those youre constantly doing something whereas the click and hold mechanic feels so much more slowpaced like youre spending a lot of time just waiting for the enemy to approach.Id suggest that there be some way to be more aware of how much youre leveling up such as by the map being more open  you can choose what level to play but if you try to play a later level right away maybe because theres some special item to collect there youll find youre too weak to do it and so then when you can get past it later it might actually feel like an accomplishment instead of just the same stuff again but with different graphics.  I suppose having some story told as you go along would add to the feeling of progress too and actually give a reason to continue.  Like Defenders Quest I guess but with this gameplay instead of the tower defense gameplay.  Certainly its interesting to see a game mechanic I havent come across before and the graphics and sound look very polished so it would be good to see this game continue.,gamemaker,d7yx261,1,t5_2qw2g
9046125,0,t1_d7yxbox,Parenting is definitely the way to go and personally I would take it step farther to save you from putting the collision code in every weapon by making a parent weaponbullet object. You can then check for a collision between the parent enemy and the parent bullet and the parent bullet can be set to do n amount of damage where n is a set in the create event of each unique child bullet. If need be you could also add other variables for range or bullet speed etc. That way you dont need collision code for each type of weapon you would only need to set the unique variables. Thats what Im doing in my current project I do it the other way around for enemy bullets as well so I only need collision code in two bullet objects the parent enemy bullet and the parent player bullet.,gamemaker,d7z773n,1,t5_2qw2g

9108018,0,t1_d86g2ny,Having hand written vector math and the like gives you far more precise control and you can see what you are changing relatively easily but ultimately leads to far more work setting it all up. There is also a very very minimal difference in performance that is fairly redundant to care about truth be told. As long as you understand how the builtin vector functions work you will achieve the exact same result as manually using your own but thats where the challenge lies. In tutorials ultimately I feel they want to reach a wider audience as possible and young teens and hobbyist adults are typically not going to be all too familiar with vector maths unless they paid attention and retained that information when it was taught to them in school. I know at  I didnt have a clue what the magnitude of a vector was or where and when to care about it but when I moved on to other engines and cross products and the like were things you had to think about in the simplest of games I was more than happy to go watch some vids or pick up some maths books to learn it. For a quickfire tutorial though wanting to throw out as much information as quickly and have your audience see results though... Spending ten to twenty minutes explaining what a vector is why theyre used etc. will probably drive them away to another video or turn them off from game development entirely as it quickly sends them back to school.,gamemaker,d86my6o,1,t5_2qw2g

Maybe you have more free time than most and maybe youll pick things up quickly and see good progress. Like others have said though start small. It seems obvious but focus on making one level. Dont think about the rest of the game dont think about future abilities just focus on your character physics then one ability and one enemy and then one room design. This will teach you a whole bunch and also give you an idea of your road ahead. If this goes well then you already have your character you just need to make more abilities enemies and levels.

Room persistence works well right up until you have a game of decent size then it becomes a memory problem.Have a room transition object either an invisible object that the player collides with or a single object per room that check when then player leaves the room and which side they left from and then transitions the room. Before the room change set global variables for desired player x and player y. On character creation set player x and y to the global variables you stored.I actually got pretty fancy with this and store desired player x and y as player.x and player.y or whatever so if you enter the next room at the top of the door youll enter the next room at the top of that rooms door.

9775291,0,t3_5f7bah,Its because youre making more than one instance of objtext.  When you press Z to advance it also interprets that as talking to the entity again and another objtext is created.You should seriously consider making an entirely new state for dialogue sequences because right now a ton of code is running during dialogue that shouldnt and it could potentially cause all kinds of problems you can walk interact with other things during dialogue and you have the potential to be trapped because as soon as dialogue ends by pressing Z you just initiate it again.

I have a system in place for it but its not as pretty as i would like code wise that is it looks fine    Draw Sprite using fakeD sprite offset Distance Offset Direction  is up ignores viewangle rotation.    Only self can be animated due to performance issues with getting spriteindex for name lookup.    suffix the animated d sprite with A where  is the amount of subimages per model.    a d sprite with  subimages would be A            Get the subimages per frame d height of the sprite    spriteHeight  getdspriteheightsprite        forvar i   i lt spriteHeight i            var xoffset  xpos  lengthdirxoffsetLength  i viewangleoffsetDirection        var yoffset  ypos  lengthdiryoffsetLength  i viewangleoffsetDirection                var xoffdone  xoffset  lengthdirxzpos viewangle        var yoffdone  yoffset  lengthdiryzpos viewangle                drawspriteextsprite ifloorimageindexspriteHeight xoffdone yoffdone scaleX scaleY angle color alpha        You draw all the diferent frames in the animation like a normal nonanimated d sprite and put them after each other bottom of frame mid of frame top of frame bottom of frame  mid of frame  etc etc.you need to add A to all your animated d sprites. The two  are how many subimages there are in a frame so to say.If you would need  subimages to draw the model standing still you write call your sprite something like sprmySpriteAIf your model seems to warp through the ground the A isnt correct and you have a different amount of frames.you may also need to alter the script a bit since your variables may be called something else This means your sprite may have several hundred subimages though.I hope that made sense ,gamemaker,dcoz4oa,1,t5_2qw2g

11120220,0,t3_5yrp53,Its because the Draw GUI event comes after the Step event and since it executes both statements on the same tick you press the key objcontroller checks for the key instantiates the dialog box the dialog box checks the key advances to the second line it would make more sense to either a execute the code for changing the line in an event that comes before the event that instantiates the dialog box b having some sort of cooldown timer that locks the dialog box from advancing to the second line until it reaches  or c executing both actions on the same event with an ifelse conditional.I did the third one.

Understand each line you copy from tutorials and in the future you will understand these things by yourself But now to the issue    imageangle  minabsdd   signddMeans that for each fram your are subtracting dd the angle difference. Meaning the object will turn until this difference is . mindd make sure it never turns more than  degrees per frame. This code is okHowever what you want to do    imageangle  minabsdd   signdd  This makes you subract the angle difference capped to  MINUS . so for each frame you subract at least  degrees. Making your object spin atleast  degrees per frame. This code is not ok. Becuase the orignal idea was to make the angle difference . But you dont want that. You want it to be .

I dont think I had this focus from the start it just kind of appeared at some point. Im sure there will be a moment when it just clicks for you and you just lose interest in doing pointless stuff like watching TV TV shows are a trap every single one.Most people will tell you to start small and finish a simple clone to get yourself familiarized with the engine. I cant say if thats a good or bad advice because I didnt follow it but my advice would be make a game YOU would love to play. For example I love Souls games and thus I am making a game that is somewhat inspired by Souls design.
