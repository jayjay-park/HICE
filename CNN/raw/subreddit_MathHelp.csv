3330529,0,t3_2yanu0, WALL OF TEXT WARNING.  Ive tried to explain it as simply as I can but I honestly dont know if youll understand it all.This is due to these things called hypercomplex numbers.You may have come across complex numbers before numbers of the form a  bi where i is the square root of . Hypercomplex numbers make things even more complex in both senses of the word by having more square roots of .For example quaternions aka dimensional hypercomplex numbers are numbers of the form a  bi  cj  dk where i  j  k   ij  k jk  i and ki  j. HOWEVER multiplication is NOT COMMUTATIVE that is to say order matters ji  k kj  i and ik  j. Note that the quaternions right now are merely mathematical creations with few reallife applications. Also note that reversing the order of the operands will give you the original answer   if you remove all the real values prior to and after the multiplication. Look familiar? This is also a property of the cross product. Ill admit I dont fully understand this link but this should at least provide you with some sort of enlightenment.Similarly the dimensional cross product is related to the octonions dimensional hypercomplex numbers which are of the form a  be  ce  de  fe  ge  he  ie. The multiplication is absolutely horrible and so therefore not on your syllabus but the ideas are the same reversing the two multiplicands will flip the sign of the result ignoring any real numbers.If you read a bit more into hypercomplex numbers youll find theres one last set I havent mentioned the sedenions or the dimensional hypercomplex numbers. The reason why the sedenions do not give you a dimensional cross product is something that unfortunately requires university mathematics to understand but the gist of it is that you can multiply two nonzero sedenions to get zero whereas you cant do so with either the octonions or the quaternions. This completely screws with the definition of the cross product so mathematicians simply throw it into the trash.You may think that theres a dimensional cross product given that there are complex numbers dimensional. Youd be right! However this particular cross product is of NO INTEREST WHATSOEVER because crossing any two such dimensional vectors always gives you . P,MathHelp,cp7wnv6,2,t5_2qz84

And I suppose it would make sense to have cycles for one third of a week also but that would have to be an irrational number in terms of days so most people probably would think of weeks in terms of either days or cycles but not cycles in terms of days.It occurs to me that people in my story could talk about sleeping for a day or so which would sound funny to someone who still uses the terrestrial time system.,MathHelp,cpe45l2,1,t5_2qz84

The thing you are solving for is time and time is your unknown quantity.  Just because you dont right an equation doesnt mean its not algebra because you have an unknown quantity of time.

8505796,0,t3_4w5h4o,Quadratic equations can be expressed in a couple different forms. There is ax bxc called standard form I think but also sometimes called yintercept form. In addition to what uedderiofer was talking about the c is also the yintercept. Then there is vertex form which looks like axb k The point b k is the vertex of the parabola. It is important to remember the b is being subtracted in the equation so when youre figuring out what point the vertex is at you need to invert the sign. For example if you have the equation yx   the vertex is at   and if you have the equation yx  the vertex is at  .

10076738,0,t3_5k33k7,Ive noticed that a source of difficulty in this problem is the interchangeability of digits that repeat the same number of times see my earlier comment.There are several ways to organize this but I see you start with picking the three digits so lets work with that.The procedure then could be. Pick the digits you will use.. Assign all the digits to the letters. In the case of letters that repeat the same number of times we will assign the smaller digit to the earlier letter alphabetwise. This prevents a case where simultaneously interchanging both letter positions and digitletter assignments yields the same final result number. In practice we look at categories like letters that repeat  times and assign two digits to that category smaller digit to the earlier letter alphabetwise.. We permute the letters.. Multiply all the nowindependent choices.For exampleHow many decimal digit strings are some sort of anagram of the pattern AAABBBCCDEFG like  or ?. we need  digits so  C .. We assign  digits to repeat  times then  digit from those remaining to repeat  times then  digits from those remaining to repeat  time so  C  C  C . This is equivalent to permuting xxyzzzz or !!!!. We permute AAABBBCCDEFG so !!!!!!!!. Final answer N   C  !!!! !!!!!!!!Finally in your approach you handle the two patterns AAABC and AABBC separately and apply step  to both afterwards. This is fine and organization is up to the solver.,MathHelp,dbl0qkm,3,t5_2qz84

10398464,0,t3_5ox73g,Percentage difference is just that the percent different these two values are. Percent change is just that as well how much one has changed from one to the next. What you want is percent difference as these two values are independent from each other. Think of it like this  If it were Player A in Game  scored  points and then the same Player A in game  scored  points percentage change would be helpful to determine just how different this same player did between two games. But when comparing two different values from two different players you want percent difference in order to compare them. Percent change would give you how much changed from Player A and Player B which doesnt make much sense because they arent the same player at all so it doesnt yield a useful number. Percent difference will give you useful data because youre comparing two different players. ,MathHelp,dcmqdh0,2,t5_2qz84

10588438,0,t1_dd83r0u,Yes. When you plug in a number greater than or equal to  into gx you get a number greater than or equal to  i.e. something in the domain of g. When you put that into gx you get the number that you started with. And yes you should specify the restriction when you define g. Im not sure whether youve come across this notation before but if you have a function f  U gt V then the inverse function absolutely has to look like f  V gt U. To put it more simply you can only put numbers into the inverse function if you can get them out of the original function and you can only get numbers out of the inverse function if youre allowed to put them into the original function.The key point is that you want g gx   x. But if g gives us some number that isnt greater than or equal to  then we cant have this because we have no idea what g does to such numbers.,MathHelp,dd846y6,2,t5_2qz84

10793196,0,t3_5uddaw,So for the first one the easiest approach is to get all the xs on one side and all the constants regular numbers to the other side. ie xx  . Then combine like terms and then youll want to divide the coefficient the number next to the x across so the variable is alone.The next one is a little more involved. Youll want to distribute the y on the left side then move the  to the left side as well so every term is on the left equaling . Then you can factor the polynomial use the quadratic equation or a graph to solve for y.,MathHelp,ddt8pr5,1,t5_2qz84

11141378,0,t3_5z2kgq,Dont try to introduce time into the model it kind of mucks things up. When the dog is at the point xy suppose that the rabbit is at the point a. That the dog is running directly at the rabbit can be expressed with the equationgt y  ayx  yaxsince ydydx is is the slope of the tangent line along the dogs path and this tangent line connects the dog and the rabbit. The main problem then is to figure out what a is in terms of y and x and this is where your observation of a term in the given DE resembles something found in the arclength formula. Regardless of what time it is when the dog is at xy you can calculate the distance it has traveled by the arclength formula. This is the same distance that the rabbit has traveled theyre moving at the same speed which happens to coincide with a.
