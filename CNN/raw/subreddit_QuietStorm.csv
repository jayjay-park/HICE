5214639,0,t3_3mfi5b,Just posted This Time the Janet song with Kathleen Battles soaring soprano background vocals over at another subreddit Im involved with rlongerjams. It leans heavier on the rock side but its a clever idea to capture music that lasts for a while of many different genres. Link in the sidebar as well.edit the Portuguese lyric video accompanying this song is due to the fact that it had the highest quality audio of the song by far from the ones that came up when I searched. Whenever possible guys try to link to a higher quality audio clip  or above would be great because then it sounds nice and consistent on the raddit player. Thanks ,QuietStorm,cvek2li,1,t5_36l3v
