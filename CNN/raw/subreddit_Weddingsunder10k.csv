If youre going to do that I would say you should keep the invites to just close family and friends. Some people go by the rule that guests must know the bride and groom.  Think of who else you could cut out to compromise.  Co workers?  That friend you havent seen in a long time?  I would set a hard and fast age limit.

7576825,0,t3_4itg3v,This may be me reliving what I WISH I did for my own wedding but I dont think anything is wrong with having a small intimate ceremony and then a large reception at your place. I wanted actually the reverse where fill the church!  for the ceremony but wanted a small intimate BBQ about  at my home afterwards. I wish I would have held my ground and done that but got persuaded by all the thats not right and thats ridiculous by select family and bridal party. I ended up having all guests at both about  people.My point is I dont think you should compromise your ideal scenario because of what others think. If you and your fiance like the idea do it! In the end it is you two that will live with your decision.,Weddingsunder10k,d33g5nk,3,t5_2vplf

The thing is hers hasnt arrived yet and the wedding is in  weeks. It has been shipped yesterday though and should arrive any time now but she is flipping out rightfully soMy point is If you have nerves of steel you can save a lot of money and get a very fancy dress.If you order your dress online and it gets lost or it doesnt look good then youre left with some hundred bucks wasted and additional stress.,Weddingsunder10k,d44rljc,3,t5_2vplf
7975761,0,t3_4mq8ge,I totally agree with the other two here.  Do whats right for you and your fiance first and foremost!!  Im a planner and Ive had this discussion with a few brides in our first meeting.  They ask so how much money is this all going to cost.  Everyone goes on and on about this Budget issue and how in the beginning you have to come up with this final dollar amount.  In reality you pay for things a little at a time.  For example if you book a venue for a year from now you have a year to pay for it.  So send money every month or quarter to pay it off.  Then start buying little things as you go.  There is so much on craigslist for second hand decorations because other brides buy a ton of mason jar centerpieces and now doesnt know what to do with them.  But pay for things a little at a time.  You may end up going over that k budget but you wont even really notice it because you are getting things you can afford at the time and that you love.  Dont ever skimp on something to save money and regret it later.  So that also means if you need to postpone thats ok too.  You have to be ready to get married and if there are other things that are popping up that is stressing you out more then handle that first.  You and your fiance are still together and thats whats important.  Do it when its right for you.And when you are ready and if you go see a venue and they ask you what your budget is lie and tell them k.  I mean do the research on venues and pick one that you can reasonably afford.  But so many venues expect you to have a number already and its unreasonable.  Trust me I work at a venue and when I see potential clients I never ask the budget.  I show them what we have and a breakdown of the costs for everything and remind them that if they breakdown the payments its affordable.  I hate when I see other venues ask what your budget is and when someone doesnt know or says a number too low the venue blows them off.  Thats so frustrating for me to watch.  So its ok to guess since thats almost what they are expecting you to do.  Then take home the paperwork and talk about it and figure out if you can break the total into monthly or quarterly payments that can work for you.  If not tell them thanks but no thanks.Hope it helps!!!!  Good luck and congratulations!,Weddingsunder10k,d4cjuvj,2,t5_2vplf

Why dont you ask your mom to help with a DIY wedding project like making fabric flowers from thrifted fabric so she feels like she contributed.Side note I was grocery shopping with coupons once and one of the coupons wasnt working properly but I was willing to wait.

If you can try to consciously focus on working to stop that as it really can take away from spontaneous lovely photos.

11011199,0,t1_defl863,I cant ditto this enough. It really is up to you if you want to do your hair and makeup they arent necessary by any means. You should be comfortable on your wedding day so if you dont usually wear makeup and it feels fake to you then by all means skip it. If you want to wear makeup you can find a artist and ask them to go super light and natural on everything and a good one should be able to accommodate this with no issues. As for hair again do what you want to be comfortable you can do simple curls with a curling iron or curlers if you want to be fancy. As the PP said if you have a regular hair dresser then you can ask them if they would be able to do your hair and they might even have a recommendation for a makeup artist as well.  If you decide to go with hair and makeup artist you can pay for your brides maids or offer up the option for them to pay if you want them to have a certain look then again according to the etiquette you should pay. I opted to pay for mine to have their hair and makeup done. ,Weddingsunder10k,deg37fm,3,t5_2vplf

We arent having a plated dinner service serving lots of appetizer type foods and fancy cheeses and fruits mentioned on the invite that is was a light refreshment reception so everyone knew there was no substantial meal.Having a limited alcohol menu beer and wine only with non alcoholic choices as well.We arent having any favours I cant think of a single wedding Ive been to where I remember what the wedding souvenir was. Vistaprint sale for invites no savethedates and email RSVP.There is minimal decorations just using fresh flowers as my mom is a florist by trade got lucky there.I think that the most important piece for us was finding a venue where we didnt have a minimum and we are able to choose what we want to serve. My SO and I are pretty simple when it comes to our relationship the day is about getting married to one another and not so much about impressing guests.
