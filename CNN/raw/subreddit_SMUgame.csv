2231500,0,t3_2kp3yn,Level up system has been changed too get way more xp but it costs a whole lot more now too I ranked up   and   and it cost me  vials.pic You can also view all the kinds of different spidermen to get from a specific portal now which is nice.,SMUgame,clnh6el,2,t5_33oof

2247127,0,t1_clpdvik,I think the lag problem is more prevalent on android lots of different hardware and the app is not optimized for all of them specifically.I get lag sometimes on ios too mostly when I get an emailapp notification it is very manageable though.Bad swipes havent really changed at all in my experience.,SMUgame,clpgo53,2,t5_33oof
2262984,0,t3_2hmg33,So lag and popin are causing some serious issues on my runs.  I just spent  hours trying to get  bosses beat for Fright Night I got it for anyone wondering  and I died more times to lag than anything else.  Basically it would lag when I went to change lanes and sometimes it would register sometimes it wouldnt and Id be waiting for almost a second to see what happened throws off my rhythm.  It wasnt every time but it was nearly  times every run which is ridiculous.Pop in when webswinging was also an issue.  The precision combo targets sometimes wouldnt load in until I was already too high or low to get them along with the lasers that would surround them.  I didnt die from this but it did cost me some combos.I definitely think we need some sort of graphics slider or reoptimization of the graphics.  Im on the iPhone s so I know Im a bit back when it comes to uptodate software but I shouldnt be handicapped because the game is poorly optimized.,SMUgame,clrfbb8,2,t5_33oof
2267552,0,t1_clqv9pl,Ive had this happen before. I gave it a few ours and made sure my score was reflected on the page where you get to select your spidermen then I just shut down the app and reopened it a few seconds later. Seems to work so far. Be sure to give it some time though a couple hours. Ive shut it down too quickly before and lost my score.,SMUgame,clrzmcl,1,t5_33oof

2481562,0,t3_2nzwqr,Serious props. Just open two didnt pull any. Pulled a Epic BP SpiderMan and a Rare Last Stand SpiderMan. Waste of  ISOs Id say. Part of the game I guess. Maybe pull him in my event portal. ,SMUgame,cmih8id,1,t5_33oof

2536945,0,t1_cmppi3f,I think the  to near miss would be great as well but nearly  of my deaths have been from trying to near miss and I have been getting much lower scores because of it. I feel that unless you are really good at it the  to attacks is better. Just get good enough to near miss to keep your combo active rather than attempting to near miss all the time. I feel this is the best strategy for myself.,SMUgame,cmppqql,1,t5_33oof

2889516,0,t3_2t7oty,The best explanation is that the multi day events are allowing players to rack up plenty of ISO s allowing to purchase more spideys to rank up their own. Especially since their is a portal that gives you  and up for  ISO. ,SMUgame,cnwjhxh,2,t5_33oof

3901916,0,t3_354608,I enjoyed a lot of the upgrades. One thing is thats annoying is when the goal is KO and one of the characters has a  on KO it doesnt register on that event toward your total.

I didnt get any of the six star spideys that it promises so Ive got that going for me which is nice...But yeah the Titan thing is a mess.Its an unfortunate reality of these types of games where youre little more than a piggy bank. And partly due to that its completely lopsided by those that pay through the nose to get higher scores. And someone is always going to pay so theyre never going to stop.Its just a pain in that arse that I actually really like this game.Hadnt heard about the layoffs but I cant say that Im all that surprised.,SMUgame,csywkq6,2,t5_33oof

4984122,0,t1_cumr915,This is another one of those placeholder events theyve been doing lately to keep us occupied until the next update and because of layoffs. This event was originally a week long which is why the requirements for the progression rewards are pretty high.

5307270,0,t3_3nk94t,Welcome Maria! May your tenure be long and bountiful. If youre listening I will gladly give my feedbackWhat I like so far Collecting the different universe spideys. So many interesting ones and I made it a bit of a mission to collect some of the issues. Daily rewards. Even when I am so busy I cant play much I am banking somewhere around  isoday saving for a rainy day. I had a few issues and support was fast and accurate This subreddit. While I initially looked for bugfixes and news of the gametap Gameloft forums this subreddit contains far more info. I REALLY like you are taking an interest in us. You will find much positive feedback constructive criticism complaints praises and sharable moments. I hope we will come to like each other on here What I dont like about the game Drops for legendaryTitanbuffed spideys are too low for event portals. I frequently pull spideys that I could find in the regular premium portal deterring my desire to complete the event progression rewards effort vs reward I am unable to play while on my boring conference calls Nexus ...soon to be  or x. Premium portal is dry. I have almost all available spideys from that portal save for ranking up  or .  VIP contains a lot of repeats for me. I burned through too much to trust itgo for a titanMy Wishlist Spidey trading! Restricting to each tierlevel but trading a samelevel unneeded  Gwen for that last  Arachnido Jr each party needs to rank up...a euphoric dream Ability to play while on a call nexus  Cycle out the epicsrares in the premium and vip portal On the spidey info a picture of the spidey card AND a cover of their first appearance or feature example SpiderArmor  Faster scrolling when picking spideys side scrollbar I find myself swiping and swipng and swiping to manage my spideys  Spidey symbol notification icon on notification bar currently the fine Gameloft logo.

5362696,0,t1_cvx3abk,Not really. Its a fine compromise between not giving titans and doing so. Theyre giving out titans that are only useful if you already have one.,SMUgame,cvx58j9,1,t5_33oof
5743690,0,t3_3tr4e4,This is the shit feature that these geniuses half baked into the update that has been the source of so much mind numbingly stupid UI bugs that is plaguing the game inability to easily use the first rank up card on a Spidey  side scrolling problems on climbing and free fall areas  messed up Spidey ops screen uiHorrible development discipline  Im pretty sure thats what is plaguing the dev team of GLSMUgame. I wouldnt be surprised if it came to light that they do not use a modern version control system to track source code changes... Heck! Most likely they may be doing zip over email as the method of development... ,SMUgame,cx926x3,4,t5_33oof
6011451,0,t3_3xtfhy,No its better to try and pull Agent Venom from the portal. If you do hell have  stars already. It would be a waste to use them all at once now because youd have to then pull MORE Venom from more portals to fully rank him up because youll only be left with a  star to begin with. Also youll have  buffed characters for the current event hold off!,SMUgame,cy7mpwu,3,t5_33oof
