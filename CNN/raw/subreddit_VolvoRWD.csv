2072428,0,t3_2ikmaw,Hey there. At this point the simplest solution is probably to get an identical radio from another . Im sure someone on Turbobricks will have one. Given that most people chuck them to install an aftermarket head unit I bet you can get it for like .Another much better if you ask me option is to bin the stock head unit entirely and install a modern headunit. Youll get an AUX IN jack and the radio will have a better signal and tune faster. In the US you can get a decent basic headunit for cheap e.g. this Sony oneIf you do go the aftermarket option youll also need a fascia kit and an ISO wiring adapter Without the adapter you will need to solder wires.If youre thinking that swapping the headunit is hard provided you use the ISO lead adapters its really super simple  its all plugandplay. You only need a screwdriver to screw the fascia adapter in place and to bend the clips into place on the mounting bracket.,VolvoRWD,cl391uk,3,t5_2qk38

11062369,0,t3_5s9w85,Dont know if this is still an issue for you and its been a while since Ive had charging issues in a redblock car.  Assuming you have probably exhausted everything else try checking this. If I recall its called the exciter wire but its actually the wire that goes from your alternator to your battery light on your dashboard. Im pretty sure you alternator will not charge if this connection is bad. Do you see the battery light when you turn the key to the on position?  not actually cranking the motor if not look into that wire being an issue. I dont know if the actual light bulb in the dash being burnt out whilst all wiring is good matters. It may. Try googling exciter wire Volvo  ect ect. Im too tired right now but it may be worth looking into,VolvoRWD,delwgny,1,t5_2qk38
11268601,0,t3_60r1fn,Use the diagnostic tool embedded in the engine. You will get codes if its an MAF issue. I think its unlikely but its worth a shot and only takes a few minutes. Vapor lock is also unlikely slightly more so if its a turbo. Clean the throttle body housing and check all the gaskets and hoses on the intake path to make sure they are in good shape. The fact that it only happens after hours of operation means something isnt reacting well to long exposure to heat. Oh and check your thermostat. In fact consider outright replacing it since youll already have your head under the hood.If the air pathways check out move on to the fuel. Pressure checking is very easy on these cars just Google it and you will find solid instructions.I had a  with a similar issue a few years back mine turned out to be a very small crack in the fuel uptake hose of all places. Anyway start with the front of the car air intake and work your way back to the gas tank until you find the weakleakycracked part.,VolvoRWD,df9a26i,1,t5_2qk38
