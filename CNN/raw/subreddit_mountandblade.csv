It was tedious but highly worth it to see their recognizable faces around me in battle. This is me and my buddy after one of my favorite MampB experiences.The story behind the imageMy character had become separated from the rest of the army in some extremely dense forest with Vaegir everywhere. Getting overrun I commanded the companions to follow me. Lyle was the only one around but charged in with his twohanded axe and after some initial desperation together we cleared that forest.  The screenshot is pretty dark but we are both covered in the blood of our enemies.Moments like that are why I game. ,mountandblade,ceg82l4,2,t5_2qzpd

309849,0,t1_cfcuqem,i do too. it would be nice if you could issue slightly more in depth command but i like that it feels like youre a single dude shouting orders and not an omnipotent all seeing eye like say total wari would like to be able to sort my units differently though. i would really like for unit groups to be able to belong to more than one group. That would cut down on a lot of annoying button mashing.I.e. i can tell infantry to move forward or whatever and i have both companions spears and swords lumped into infantry.i can then issue finer grain commands by telling my companions to charge and my swords to step back.much it much easier than fiddling with each group and trying to get them all lined up.or perhaps i have all my companions sorted as companions but also companion footcompanion horse but also just infantry and cavalrythat would make things easy. Rather than switching everything before battles. Say its an easy one i just want my companion cav to sweep through i can just select them and tell them to charge.or i just want my companion infantry to go in and gain some xp solo. easy. ,mountandblade,cfcvtwg,1,t5_2qzpd

597267,0,t1_cg1msn8,I like this question because I just did this.It might be different because I used TweakMB to make much higher army sizes i could get  soldiers if i wanted and prisoner sizes up to  for me but this is how i did it.Basically get a moderately sized military force together. Maybe . Then go into Swadia and Rhodok and find bandits with lots of Manhunter prisoners. Attack and hire the manhunters. Then you can slowly start tbuilding them up. I got lucky I have  Slaver Chiefs  Slave Crushers and  Slave Hunters. You can store your other soldiers in a castle or town now.Its impossible to defend or attack towns with this setup because they are all useless off their mount but in the field? Unstoppable. And why Manhunters? They pay for themselves. Ride into battle with a Maul or Warhammer with your Slaver warriors and you can knock out all of them. I regularly take out  groups of outlaws. Coming into town with  prisoners for sale will bring in  denars if not more. Its really really easy money. Sell Peasents and Looters and I to Slavers and the rest to the Ransom Broker.The Hard part is keeping your manhunters alive for their first couple ranks so I suggest either keeping lethal units with you until they level up to a hunter and crusher. Crushers are really really hard to kill Chiefs are near impossible unless they lose their Elephant. A single charge by a chief can knock out  people. ,mountandblade,cg85vim,4,t5_2qzpd

895690,0,t3_24d3y4,It is pretty fun so far. There are lots of features that will be very familiar to Warband players but the addition of ships and naval combat adds a whole new angle that is refreshing and exciting after years and years of playing Warband and the various mods for it. It is a little buggy at the moment but I have not found anything game breaking after a few hours of play. My biggest complaint at the moment is the economy but that is something that the devs have stated is a work in progress. If you like single player Warband and have an interest in this genre I would say that  is a small price to pay. Im looking forward to future updates but what they have to show so far is really fun. ,mountandblade,ch63eih,18,t5_2qzpd

953963,0,t3_251f4b,Well for starters Warband is the right way to go. Itll be a long while before youre able to field a big army. Your best bet at this point would probably to have yourself a smallish band of warriors say  archers or crossbows plus another  infantry and go from there.What youre going to need soon is cash. Easiest way in the early game is to trade between Curaw and Wercheg salt for iron and viceversa. If you run into villains at least you have a fair chance of beating them at this stage. Later you can head down towards the Sarranid lands and pick up dyes and spices theres serious money to be made from that. The risk you need to balance that with is the desert bandits very tough to beat on open ground without good troops.When you have a few thousand quid go to a city and buy a business. The most affordable one with a half decent return is probably a brewery. Vanilla Warband sees breweries make an average of about  denars a week so youre probably going to want as many businesses as possible. When you have enough cash buy up more lucrative businesses.When you have a steady income then you can start thinking about a bigger army. By now you should also have a few companions hanging around. As they level up consider making the more combatorientated ones into trainers. Your own levelling points can go into things like prisoner management and your personal combat skills. At this point you should be pretty much selfsufficient so can start thinking about conquests or vassals.Some things to think about With a couched lance and decent horse you are the most powerful soldier in the game. Be careful though as getting knocked out of a battle in Vanilla Warband makes your army lose. Avoid bandits in the earliest stages. One of the biggest frustrations is getting captured just when you have yourself a half decent group of men. Looters are pretty easy to deal with but wait until you have some higher tier troops before tackling anyone else. Run errands for lords villages etc. though avoid rescue missions early on. You will fail and you will be locked up for days. The easiest missions involve taking letters to other lords getting grain for villages and hunting down fugitives. They dont pay much but they can improve relations making life easier later. You can become a mercenary for a lord. Similar to being a vassal though you dont get a holding to look after. You do get apid though which can help with troop upkeep. Never run out of food. In fact the more variety you have with food the better but pork beef and chicken tend to go rotten before your army eat them all. Bloody hippies. Tournaments are a good way of getting money and experience if you win. Well worth taking part.The best troops are the most expensive ones naturally. But each faction specialises in a particular fighting style Vaegirs and Rhodoks have the best ranged troops the former has archers the latter crossbowmen. Both have their advantages and disadvantages but you can find out for yourself. Khergits go with horse archers which can be devastating under the right circumstances but theyre tough to manage. Poor for besieging castles and towns as well. Nords have awesome infantry. The best. If youre going to take over a town then these are the only way to go. Swadians and Sarranids both have amazing cavalry but they are very expensive.This should be enough to get you started at least. Id say once you have a decent band of men and a bit of regular cash flow you can choose whichever path takes your fancy.,mountandblade,chcq2af,6,t5_2qzpd

I myself wish for several quest to v some of the strongest impossible to beat foes. v a Bloodthirster is my dream...But others like making the Grail Knights to not be part of the main troop tree is impossible since Bretonnians are already a very weak faction without many troops. And having them not be hit I think is impossible on this engine. In fact I play Bretonnian in this mod and I have been asking for a buff so much in fact that one of the devs answered my complains and said that on the version they are working on they buffed the knights to better reflect the blessings. Yet thats something that will mostly be done like armor or  STR something like that. I know there will be a lot more content to come yet theres some things that we might never see. Painting troops? That might be impossible for this dev team. We can only hope that GW contacts the team that is making Bannerlord and asks for a Warhammer expansion. ,mountandblade,chmcmb0,1,t5_2qzpd

You can maximize this by taking prisoners and selling them.Tournaments can be good if you can win reliably quick way to get k if you bet on yourself at every opportunity.Tax collecting quests can also work like a loan or just easy money if you dont mind shafting the quest giver.If you have the upfront capital you can make investments in the towns which will give you a regular income though profits vary and it can take a bit to make back the initial investmentLong term what you need are fiefs this is where your substantial income will come from though you will have to keep them in good condition or profits will drop like a rock.You can also do some trading or raiding but I dont have much in the way of specific advice there.some of these options might not be available if youve joined a faction ,mountandblade,cii8zoo,1,t5_2qzpd

1341359,0,t1_cikgsdq,Snappy arent you?I played it but only because of the praise and the tips that circles this subreddit its honestly a grindy version of native with less stuff. Alright you found two orignal features which is custom troops and invading factions. Lets go over the rest you said. Noldor  Sure its not a native feature but its just overpowered bandits with top gear called Elfs its just a faction. You cant even become their friends without doing like the normal bandits and joining them in battles till they like you enough. Achivements  Its just Achivements if you think thats a reason for playing a game then thats silly. Qualis Gems  dragon tears just a rare currency item to get some of the OP troops of the Noldor still not a feature in its own but more of an addon of one of the above.My main issue with this mod is that almost all the things you listed and all the features it says only appears ONCE you form the Kingdom there is no content inbetween early to midlate game. Its impossible to found the kingdom without grinding to the point you can fight the other kingdoms and units. A good mod and a good game in anything is gameplay and features the whole way this does not have that. Might as well just stick those features into Native and get more gameplay and fun from the product. ,mountandblade,cikio7m,0,t5_2qzpd

I go to the Iron Islands and they hate me as well for an event taking place all the way across the other side of the map. Update  Im pretty sure I never went to a priest to declare myself a follower of rhllor but even if I did how would I renounce it?  if thats the case than it makes no sense to make me an enemy of EVERY single townvillage given the east may be more accepting or the fact that storywise I should still have good relations with Dragonstone given their forced to at least openly announce their love for their new god.

1646916,0,t1_cjmp55d,Interesting.  For some reason it never occurs to me to actually do quests for lords.  How long did it take because I hate waiting for quests from lords.  All my generals during my run were companions with only one lord recruited from Pentos when I conquered it. I constantly conquer Essos because Lorath is so ideal even in late game. It snowballs out of control considering the Dothraki keeps commanders in line long enough for me to pick apart factions.  I went straight to Volanqis after finding out they were at war with the Dothraki and had lost. I took the Dothraki controlled territory as fast as possible while they were sieging Volantis and waited for the Volands to fight the Dothraki off.  I conquer Volantis after eliminating the Khizra off the map by paying them my entire treasury and go after all of the Volands territory.  Regroup siege treaty repeat until I had everything on that continent.  Issue is I constantly tried to fight off desertersslaversdothrakithief hordesbasically everything that was spewing forth from the desert. I did it because I thought if I protected the roads caravans would reach my territories and enrichen my castles.  Thats when it got too grindy for me and I quit. ,mountandblade,cjmr9yz,2,t5_2qzpd

Still trainer is pretty good.About you decide  Just about what you did You joined Swadia and befriended Halrus but then rebelled so he become your enemy? Why i should even bother with leveling relationships with him?If i recall correctly trainer is personal skill not party so no one receives bonuses from other part members and you cant level up skills past  with books.

2596506,0,t3_2pjc0g,As an NA admin Im intrigued. Who was the admin in question? When was this happening?Bear in mind also that the admins cant see everything that happens all the time. We cant be everywhere at once By and large we arent supposed to punish a TKer unless we have concrete proof that it happened i.e. witnessing it ourselves or hearing it from multiple people or if the offender says something like Fuk u or Dont get in my way. There have been times when I trusted someone ingame whom I knew from the community who told me slay that guy he TKd me on purpose and then I get a Steam message from the slayed saying wth I didnt TK him on purpose it was shot from across the map. Conflicting stories.People tend to have unrealistic expectations of admins for this game unfortunately especially when theres a very low adminplayer ratio. I cant tell you the number of times that Ive been yelled at in dead chat for not preventing a TKer or responding in less than  seconds to a guy trying to TK or for slaying someone who DID accidentally TK but said something dumb about it afterwords that made me think otherwise. I wish I could be everywhere so that everyone else could have fun but even if I sat in spectator every round and cycled through I would still miss offenders.Now that you were tempbanned was a bit over the top I agree. If in the eyes of the admin in question you had committed a second offence then the next step would be a kick as a warning before a tempban. There are some admins who are heavyhanded especially when dealing with someone they perceive as a troll.Finally I have to say that I take offence with your blanket statement. Id like to think that I am  of the time a just admin as are most of my colleagues. But there are those that have less patience with trolls or people they might think of as being such.,mountandblade,cmxi0n1,1,t5_2qzpd

2919923,0,t3_2tja5w,Personally I travel from town to town doing tourneys and killing the occasional bandit group until Ive got around k. That takes a long time though. A good bet would be to join a faction as a mercenary should eventually come up if you ask enough lords for a job and just raid a metric fucktonne of villages while avoiding any battle in which your victory isnt assured. Youre already a vassal and have castles so youd have to ask your liege to release you from your oaths. Before that Id take as many of your highlevel troops with you. Itd be expensive and youll probably be pretty slow but its worth it incase you ever get into a battle during your time as a mercenary.Once youve got a lot of money go to every town possible and buy productive enterprises. Dyeworks usually give the most profit and are the most reliable but are the most expensive at k. Once youve got a good economic base youll be able to maintain a large army of hightier troops without bankrupting yourself.

3053079,0,t3_2v4ebv,From one aspiring writer to anotherI intend this to be constructive criticism only. What you have so far is good but I personally would add some improvements. It may be we have different writing styles but to me this story begs to be more descriptive. Weave us a tale of the jingle of chainmail as wind sweeps across verdant suntouched plains of Calradia! Let the thundering of hooves and the clash of weapons break the silence of the day! In my opinion a little extra describing never hurts and many things seem ambiguous the way you write them. admitably I am guilty of doing this too.I think you have a good batch of starting characters and Im interested to see where you go with them. One thing I feel I should note is that if you are going to turn this into a full fledged book I think it would be a good idea to give small refreshers on the specific characters factions and locations in Calradia as even if you play the game for hours on end and have sunk weeks worth of time it still helps to be prompted about things. I know I dont remember where every village is or who every lord is. Describe these as you see them!I hope you continue to work on this you are off to a good start I believe. Also never give up on this if you are truly passionate about it. I look forward to more!,mountandblade,coeg716,9,t5_2qzpd

Definitely not shattering after multiple uses unless theres lateral force is applied to it and if youre giving point properly that wont happen.Being forced to let go of it based on it being completely stuck in an enemy though? Thats more likely.Really the only types of lances that should be shattering are ones based off of the ones Polish winged hussars used precisely because they were hollow but they were also ridiculously long.

The Sassanian Empire which was middle eastern culture but spoke Persian which in Arabic is called Farsi doesnt mean the Sassanid arent based off the Sassanian Empire.

If you ever get an invitation to join a kingdom directly always decline because the fief you get is almost universally at a bad position was recently raided gets raided often etc.. You can get hired by a kingdom by just having enough men and talking to a lord about work. You then get payed a sum whihc isnt nearly enough to cover costs but it gives you opportunities like war loot and prisoners and raiding without losing reputation Having a high rep helps a lot. I advise against looting villages you want to conquer later as the higher the opinion of you is the better soldiers they are gonna give you.,mountandblade,cpudzir,1,t5_2qzpd

3802993,0,t1_cqpqy1w,Well the support for large battles is pretty terrible as far as optimization is concerned. Highend machines struggle due to the poor resource optimization. I remember getting a large FPS boost from turning off blood and other weird settings while general details did not affect much. I want the ability if you have the cash to afford the power to send out s of units and expect a good framerate and minimal crashes. That combined with a better combat and tactics would improve the base game environment and allow more ambitious mods.And I am not talking about a coop campaign but a more streamlined time wise multiplayer mode that acts like the single player setting. It could be in and out  drops but supporting  human entities with their own war raging armies. I  want to have more structured battles against equally challenging opponents. It could be like eve online but you are building up armies to attack others or support them. A very dynamic system for those who do not like to role play for the sake of it and instead create a dynamic passion rivalry and political environment. You might get over confident beating bandits earning gold sieging castles. But then two playercreated armies are matching all over your territory and the fear and adrenaline sets in. You could have NPCs  human characters on the field. Maybe  large dedicated servers with over  players that are constantly running never really ending with each defending their factions or creating chaosanarchy. Perhaps even a permanent death system and the ability to spend a few aspects of the game up no need to have  day waits for buildings and stuff. I do not really see the AI improving too much and this realtime based gameplay plus battle tactics could open up a huge number of possibilities. In fact I thought the multiplayer for warband would be something like this but unfortunately it was not still fun though. ,mountandblade,cqprs7l,2,t5_2qzpd

4119601,0,t1_crprh6f,gt Tracking is good when you want to track down suitable enemy armies to fight i.e. you have  knights and want to take down  enemy army you can find their tracks and follow themEh. I dont really worry about it. My solution is just to always have the biggest party I can get and if I want to get in a fight I just hang around in their territorysiege a fief and theyll show up sooner or later. And if theyre too strong I leave or split them up.gt Also in Phantasy Calradia there is an item called Dwarven Throwing Hammers which has  ammo and has a really nice base dmg  I think. Plus its blunt so you can kite around an enemy army throwing these and take them all prisoner in which case power throw is a must.Im not embarrassed to say I got really turned on by that. Ok well you got me there. Power throw is good in Phantasy Calradia. I wont debate that one. Id agree that its usually for troops.gt In mods like PoP slaving isnt really much of an option. Sure you can take down lowtier units easily but Anaconda knights Knights of EventideDawn Adventurers? You wont really be able to contest these guys until you have a good enough army and even then you wont knock them out much either theyll kill you or your troops will kill them much faster. So trading is the way to go earlymid game as its saferish and the points into CHA would also let you hire more units and let you get Persuasion and Leadership.Interesting. Ive always wanted to try playing a CHA character. When I play Pendor Ill give it a shake. This was just a general list not necessarily accurate for all mods.. Ive never made it to late game outside Native and in Native you dont WANT to recruit a whole ton of lords because they just end up hating you.

4731518,0,t1_ctqs44n,Not really you dont always have to start from scratch with mods though most mods require you to do so.Its not because they have different universes its because those mods usually add new slots in their mechanics which usually adds new features which makes saves from Native being unable to be read perfectly in those mods. For total conversions such as A Clash of Kings  AD Prophecy of Pendor etc obviously you need to have a new game since its a new universe different world map different troop trees different NPCs but you can always try your luck with MountampBlade Save Game Converter to convert your native save and play in native expansions such as Floris.If youre just looking for QOL improvement mods IMO get Tocans Calradia instead of Floris. As said Floris changes a lot of things. Its hardly Native I say. Completely reworked troop trees hundreds of new items etc. Its built on Native but youve got new stuff you need to learn again especially troop trees.Dont get me wrong its a great mod but its kind of overkill if you just want a native improved mod. Tocans Calradia gives you QOL improvement mods and just that.ukramman,mountandblade,ctqy78k,2,t5_2qzpd

4744569,0,t3_3fwf8f,Ill give you my opinions on some of the most popular mods that Ive tried out.Floris Think of this one as what the Native game should have been. It features multiple different mods in one package. The character models are redesigned there is a ton of new gear which is faction specific so if you want to get a longbow you need to look in Swadia but if you want a Sabre you need to look around the Khergit territory. Theres more diplomacy options the freelancer mod where you can join a lords army and level up as one of the factions units it adds  new heroes that can join your party. Its basically what Native Warband could have been. Prophecy of Pendor This one is known for its brutal difficulty throughout the entire game. Right at the beginning youll be constantly steamrolled by powerful aggressive parties if you dont know what youre doing hire mercenaries rather than peasants buy a mace or an axe instead of a sword at the beginning and see if you can get a fast horse. But that difficulty along with the highly detailed and interesting lore just make you want to keep playing. It makes you go Okay game you want to crush me into the ground? Fine! Ill do the same to you. At least in my experience. Lots of cool weapons armor factions and units. Plus you can form your own knighthood order and customize it however you want but that isnt until very late into the game. Anno Domini Probably the largest of any Warband mod this mod is set during medieval times in Europe. You can start in pretty much any part of the map from Northern Africa I think to Russia to Norway to Ireland and you can even start out as a vassal right from the start. All the weapons and armour are accurate to the time period and while you can still recruit units the same way like in Native you can also set it to its special Lance recruiting system. Basically you recruit a random number of recruits from a place and theyre all at different levels and types as opposed to starting out with just simple peasants. Perisno This is my personal favourite but you have to keep in mind that its not finished. Its only in . right now but its still a ton of fun. Lots of fun factions interesting lore awesome looking gear units special mounts like war elephants tigers wolves and even dragons which arent finished and cant fly or breathe fire. The only way you can get them is by using the cheatmenu because the quest to get one is bugged. It sort of matches Prophecy of Pendor in terms of difficulty but I actually find it much easier in the late game. Definitely would recommend this one.Brytenwalda This is the father of Viking Conquest. Theyre pretty much the exact same but from what I heard based on what people said about VC when it first came out Brytenwalda has a lot more features and content dont know about VC Reforged. I didnt play a lot of this one because Ive had a lot of technical issues with it like crashes and the game refusing to launch in the middle of the loading screen so I cant say much. What I did play was fun though.Light amp Darkness Heroes of Calradia is a little different. It uses the original map from the first game instead of the Warband map so no Sarranid Sultanate unfortunately and is more story focused. Its more like your traditional RPG. This one is pretty cool but the story is really generic and its also a foreign mod with a horrible English translation. Still I would recommend this one for those who are still fairly new to MountampBlade.Phantasy Calradia. I havent played a lot of this one either because the lag on the world map for me is intolerable. Its really bad but then again my PC is crap. This one uses the Warband map but makes all the towns castles and villages farther apart from each other and it adds several fantasy inspired factions like elves dark elves orcs the undead and dwarves and probably more that I dont remember. Magic is added for you to use as well as hundreds of unique units. There are a bunch of new companion characters added as well a lot of them being from these new factions. This one is currently incredibly unbalanced though because you can steamroll all the Native factions with the overpowered fantasy units. But Ive heard that in the next update they are adding more powerful units to the Native factions so that they arent as easy. Theres the very popular A Clash of Kings mod which is based on the Song of Ice and Fire books Game of Thrones. It takes place in all of Westeros and Essos. There are a number of different random events or encounters that happen across the world and depending on how you react to them they can give you a permanent bonus or a permanent penalty usually a lowered stat or two. There are also a lot of story centered quests. I havent played a lot of this one because my PC cant run it that well. Also I would suggest getting caught up by around season  of the show or the second book in the series before playing this if you have problems with spoilers. There is also one quest that is apparently is packed full of possible future spoilers but Ive never done it before. Oh and beware of stumbling...just beware...Blood and Steel is a fun one. You can affect the difficulty of it right from the beginning by choosing who you are at the start condottiere being the easiest and peasant revolutionary being the hardest. Over time some strange evil returns to the land and the game because even more difficult. Unfortunately its not finished and as far as all of us know the developer is no longer working on it. Still I think its worth it to see all the unique units and cool weapons gunpowder weapons being one of the main attractions.Thats about it for the ones Ive played. Hope this helps ,mountandblade,ctslj2u,14,t5_2qzpd

4750023,0,t1_ctt9x0s,Its really a simple concept once you get it. Your weapon has two states it can stay in. Neutral and chambered. Chambered is when youre holding the mouse down and you have an attack in the chamber.On the chamber animation that is moving from not touching anything at all to holding your sword ready your weapon is fully modeled. Its a solid object and if it hits your opponents weapon it will block them. Just like in real life.When your opponent has released a swing at you chamber your weapon so that it strikes theirs and you will block them.

4767281,0,t1_ctvg2na,Alright let me try to answer those questions . I started a game of Warband wanted to write an AAR about it. So I created a character I named Floris after count Floris IV of Holland During the game I learned about several small mods that were available and I wanted to try them all. In the AAR I wrote about these experiments and people got interested. This led to me polishing this mashup a little bit and releasing it as the Floris Mod Pack. After I released this small .version the mod started to grow into something really big. My first created mod for Warband was Faction Arms Coloured My first ever created mod... hm... If I dont count stuff like buildings for SimCity  and maps for Heroes of Might and Magic  amp  I guess it was a mod for Europa Universalis . What do you mean by your third question? If I cant create a mod for a game I love for some reason probably time restrictions due to work or stuff like that Id continue to play the game. I have had some cool mod ideas for a few games but I havent had time in a while.

5367423,0,t3_3oj6gj,The best way to trade in VC is to buy furs from Norway then sell the furs in England while buying wool in England and selling it in Dorestad. Also always buy stuff from villages since it is cheaper.In starting your own kingdom you can go the brute force method of attacking lords and besieging castles but make sure you have high right to rule.If you wanted to join a faction first then usurp the King then you go about just straight up rebelling and causing a civil war of sorts. But be sure to have high relations with the other lords so that they can join you easily. Also have high right to rule as well so you wont encounter everyone else waging war on you. In the end it is up to you to see if one method is the better way.I cant really help you with the whole preventing your troops from stealing because I know very little about that mechanic.

Imagine three or four people all trying to go through a doorway at once and youll get the idea.And then the rear ranks of the French troops tried to force the assault through by weight of numbers by throwing their bodies against the backs of the men in front of them.

5890854,0,t3_3vxap6,As far as Warband its pretty much just an open world sandbox game.  I advise getting the Floris modification for Warband just because it gives you a lot more to potentially do in addition to generally making the game much prettier and adding tons of items.  Native expansion is another mod along similar lines.  Empire III apparently expands the game to absurd levels with  factions and eleventy billion locations.Otherwise I suggest that finding a mod set in a favorite fictional or historical setting can make for a cool experience.Floris ModNative ExpansionEmpire III.............................................................Fires of War Greco Persian Wars circa BCSuvarnabhumi Mahayuth th Century Southeast AsiaLAigle Napoleonic WarsThe Red Wars Communist Civil Wars in th Century Warband UniverseGekokujo Sengoku Era JapanBellum Imperii Roman Imperial EraPhantasy Caladria High Fantasy With DEEP MagicTwilight of the Sun King War of Spanish Successions Western EuropeCursus Honorum II Early Roman Republic Era.............................................A Clash of Kings A Song of Ice and FireGame of Thrones  Some consider this the most entertaining mod ever created for any gameWarsword Warhammer Fantasy Tons of crazy units and races very much a Warhammer Fantasy mod.,mountandblade,cxrtpqr,4,t5_2qzpd

Try to get a couple dyeworks going in the north especially Rivacheg.  During wartimes you can extort a toll on enemy caravans for denars that increase with level.  You dont lose honor or relations with a lord or fief doing this the only drawback is finding their caravans.  If you search the game options you can change soldier names to show their tier do this so you can take the prisoners with the highest value to sell.

6374518,0,t1_czdrcy9,Yes and yes. But minor faction armies attacking cities is a really rare occurrence. If you have a proper garrison and are there to lead the defense such an attack isnt very difficult to repel either. As for being enemies with that kingdom yeah but thats the case when you capture something. You should be ready to play on the defensive for a while. Sometimes it feels as if it takes forever for them to give up but they always give up eventually. Another way to do it is to capture it and then send an emissary right away to a king of your choice and ask if you can be his vassal. If he says yes youll be part of that kingdom but the fief will remain yours also after you rebel again. Kings are only going to accept you when your RtR is high enough otherwise they will say something like I dont want lords with stolen lands or something like that. So crank the RtR up to    or so grab one of those cities and beef up your defenses. Or stay in your faction and request a city whenever the opportunity comes up that also works. But generally Id recommend to try and run your own kingdom at some point. Its more challenging but also great fun and you wont have to obey the retarded kings and marshals anymore. ,mountandblade,cze7o56,2,t5_2qzpd

Still seeing the same wacky sword movements and overall stiffness in combat gave me a frown cEdit After seeing the stream my opinions changed a bit. On that fight against a couple of bandits I loved the handed sword moveset and animation. Ragdoll really makes a difference in Bannerlord compared to previous MampB games. On the other hand its only mounted combat that I still dont like. Watching the guy control the horse and swing his sword felt too artificial IMO.

7851257,0,t3_4mtzri,The Broken ManHis ragged breaths were the only thing to hear.Considering how hours earlier the screams and clashing of steel were enough to make a man go deaf Barringer might have laughed if not for the fact that his throat was dry from not having drank in hours and that the multiple stabs to his abdomen limited his ability to do much of anything.At least my fatherll be happy. Died that warriors death hes always gone on about. Barringer slowly sat up and rested against a broken down wagon next to him. He let out a painful sigh and let his eyes scan the carnage before him.Well catch them off guard and slaughter them like the vermin they are. His sergeant eagerly told him and the rest of the Rhodok troops around the fire nearly a fortnight ago. Barringer swept up in the wave of nationalism eagerly cheered with the rest of them.Hoorah. Barringer let out a small chuckle causing him to grunt and nearly cry out from the pain as some blood spouted from his wound. He looked to the horizon and could make out Uxhal in the distance.All these lives lost and for what? Being a man of thirty and seven he had seen more than his fair share of violence in the name of God and Glory. Perhaps it was being among the dead that caused Barringer to start to crack. He always had preached unwavering loyalty to King Graveth and his fellow soldiers certainly enjoyed mocking him for it.He tilted his head to the side and saw Largn laying on his side a gaping hole where his shoulder would have been his face slack with pure terror. A lad of ten and nine merely a boy when he joined their company.He was soft of speech and heavy of heart. He thought back to the day him and the boys convinced Largn to visit his first brothel. The boy nearly pissed himself. Barringer almost wanted to reach out and touch him even though he was clearly too far away. Now hell be forgotten to history just like the rest of us. He looked to the ground and saw some Swadian lord laying dead at his feet a cleaver buried in his body which cut from shoulder to chest. I dug it in so deep theyll have to bury him with it. Barringer stifled his laughter and looked down to his chest wound his hands covered in blood as they tried to keep his guts in.Its time.He unsheathed his dagger and stared at it for a good while. In the reflection of it he could see himself but not for long. He saw his times as a child running through Buvran without a care in the world. He saw the time he was saved from a group of bandits by manhunters and how his dream as a child always was to join them. He saw many other things such as his time he spent with the Vaegirs when they fought alongside the Rhodoks against the Sarranids or when he served in the town watch of Jelkala. He was only a boy then. Those times were so much simpler.He held the dagger to his throat as his breathing quickened.

8514846,0,t3_4wcq6r,Hey guys. Recently Ive started recording gameplay as a hobby and to add something new to the process. Ive decided this time around to go and do something I havent really done in the past which is to hunker down and grind out a full playthrough in Warband Native normally I waffle around too long in mods Im sure some of you can relate.Thats not entirely what this post is about though. While Im fairly firm on what type of character build I want to do this time around Im always open to different army compositions as I have had success with all the different branches from vanilla to heavy skews in one direction.So I thought Id get some input. What do you think I should play? Feel free to vote on the Strawpoll or leave any comments or suggestions as well. Note that I am not a new player so this isnt an advice question Im familiar with what the most viable options are this is more of a funflavorthemechallenge run suggestion type situation.Extra Note Im not sure how Ill want to actually finish the game vassal king etc etc so perhaps leave those ideas down below as well or I can always try another poll hah!Disclaimer Im sure some of you are thinking Why Native? Well its more just a stubborn mental thing I want to complete the base blank slate game despite any flaws it might have for completionist sake. Im well aware of the many merits of even just Native expandedFlorisetc or the more stand alone mods.Thanks for taking the time to read this vote or leave a suggestion. More than aware I might be opening the floodgates for faction fanboying.,mountandblade,d65wxgq,3,t5_2qzpd

8594544,0,t3_4xhdx8,Absolutely nothing wrong with training in the arena.And by training I dont even care about your characters EXP points no. Im talking about YOU. You see when I first got this game I was only interested with the combat mechanics it was the only one of its kind at the time and didnt really care about the squabbling of the lords of the land. Having a particularly bad day week IRL I just wanted to bash some heads in. So I loaded up my save and went to the arena to get me some of that lowpoly virtual headbashing luv. This went on for a while to the point that it was my daily stress reliever.One day my wife walks in on my playing and asks me about something that I dont even remember anymore. I justly respond and subsequently had a hearty chat about things and goingons under the sun. I didnt even realize until she pointed it out that I only ever look at the screen whenever I had to talk to the Arena Master to start a new round after Ive cleared all  well... not really some of them killed knocked unconscious each other off but you get the point only glancing every now and then during combat!What Im saying is just keep playing and eventually youll get to the point where you can relatively accurately predict the AIs movements relative to yours. You dont even have to think! You kinda just know where the hit will come from and block. Occasionally your brain tells you that hesheitthey isare DEFINITELY  sure that the attack will come from here at this exact moment and you kinda just let it do its thing and chamber instead of blocking.I know Im far from the best in terms of combat skills but Im fairly certain that if you were to ask them theyll tell you that they started off similarly as well.NOTE Throw everything you know out the window when you go to multiplayer melees though.,mountandblade,d6fwqdf,3,t5_2qzpd

Hey we know its the last round of a tournament and youve dumped a bunch of money into betting on yourself but were giving you a bow and a blunt knife while your opponent gets a two handed sword. Good luck! snickersNot being able to ransom lords on my own time. Im playing the Deus Vult mod and my faction just overran the County of Tripoli in a few days. Now their faction doesnt exist anymore and no one offered to ransom their captured lords during the war so theyre just sitting in my prisoners menu and until they eventually escape.My army not being able to do anything without me. I get knocked out by the last defender of a city whos nearly dead and my three companions drag my body all the way out of the keep back through the streets up the walls and back down the siege tower into camp and give up the battle instead of just killing the last guy and proclaiming victory.How worthless sieges are. Why do the towns have  days worth of food? Who the hell is ever going to sit there for  days waiting for them to run out of food?! Especially since you cant detach yourself from a siege to find more food for your own army so you have to carry enough food to feed your entire army for  days if youre even going to try. Even castles have enough for  days and Ive never even tried to take one by starving it out.Siege assaults.

The village elder or castle manager or whatever will occasionally send you a letter saying they need help with something and you go to the fief and help them work out the problem and deal with the effects.For example sometimes theyll capture a heretic and ask you for advice on what do do with him.  If you tell them to hand the heretic over to the knights of dawn you get a relationship boost with them.  If you tell them to double check that its actually a heretic you get points with the knights of the Eventide.,mountandblade,d7rjdcm,3,t5_2qzpd

I just ride from one tournament to the next ask the Arena Master in towns where the tournaments are being held and chain together wins. On the way between towns you can killimprison bandits for extra cash.If youre currently in a faction war take a small elite party I recommend  Swadian Knights or Sarranid Mamlukes and hunt down enemy lords in the field. You get nice renown bonuses for being the underdog in spite of the fact that your elite troops will wipe them out with minimal losses. If you catch anyone just let them go and get free Honor which will be VERY useful later on if you plan on making your own kingdom.,mountandblade,d82vk2m,9,t5_2qzpd

9232169,0,t3_56tb88,Prestige is everything in Nova Aetas. You progress through the social classes based on the amount of Prestige you have. You need to have either  or  Prestige if I remember correctly before Kings and Lords will give a shit about you at all. You can gain Prestige in a few ways. Crafting items mining orechopping down trees buying property the kind you rent out each town has  slots for properties I think maybe completing quests for lords? some character traits you get from random events can affect your Prestige and having a large positive weekly income from fiefs properties and taxes. The mod tells you you have to do peasant things. Get an Axe or Mining Pick and go pay a lord to use their mine or forest. Fill up your inventory with either stone or timber and become an apprentice of one of the professions at the guild hall of the city of your choice. Then every day in game train with your professions master in the town you became an apprentice in. Every day you practice will improve your chances at successfully convincing the guild leader to let you lead your own shop. Once you get to around  chance of success you can just save scum until it works and you earn the right to have your own shop. Once you have your own shop you can turn timber and other materials into goods weapons furniture and ammunition to sell. Making an item gives you Prestige. How I started I went to the town next to the Ruins of Uxhal sp? and asked the guild leader to become a carpenters apprentice. I then trained once a day every day for a month in game yes its kind of boring. This is because every day I practiced carpentry with the master I gained  increased chance to convince the guild leader to make me a master. I then savescummed until I successfully crafted my masterpiece and became a master carpenter. Then once a master carpenter with my own carpenter shop I bought the rights to chop down trees in the forest across the river by talking to the Lord who owned the land. It cost  money IIRC. I chopped wood in the forest with my Woodcutters Axe until I had my entire inventory full of timber. Then I crafted a shit ton of chairs and used the money to buy some basic properties the cheap shacks and apartments in the surrounding towns. There was a certain point where I could now join tournaments I dont remember what Prestige level it was and I started chasing down and competing in l tournaments. With the Prestige coming in weekly from my profits and the stupid money I made from tournaments I started selling the cheap properties and replacing them with the more expensive versions.Eventually with enough tournaments won enough weekly positive income and enough highclass properties I got the offer from the King of Swadia to become a vassal. Hope this helps! If you have any questions feel free to ask! ,mountandblade,d8m8tx9,3,t5_2qzpd

9401513,0,t3_59dqnk,I always play the Empire love em. Pikemen are good in siege when they spawn with the  handed hallebards. They also level up faster I think which can be good in early game but apart from that they dont deal enough damage IMO when they spawn with the shield they just awkwardly try to pike the enemy with absolute inefficacy.I feel that Pikemen not withstanding a cavalry charge is a general flaw in MampB which is a shame. But if you use F F stand together you dont really need them anyway.Legionnaires are definitely top notch. Best regular melee unit in the game. Crossbowmen are good for the fact that they are also very good melee units but far from being the best ranged. Still an army of them will decimate any AI army. PoP ranged are broken. I also had armies of  xbowmen take a castle on their own unlike archers when they run out of bolt they will still deal crazy damage.I would say  gladiators is too much for your ratio I generally go  legionnaires for  to  glads. I always play with immortals they re the coolest got the strongest armors and do crazy damage. Unlike other KO they do need the supports of other units though. But once you have them I feel you dont really need gladiators anymore.But tbh I always play with the entire set of units because I like diversity and they all look great. I cant get enough of watching gladiators running at the front of the line great sword over the head and ready to strike. Half of the time they take an arrow in the head before reaching the enemies line ... then its just funny. But when they do manage to strike you feel the PAIN !Edit But really if you play infantry only gt F F F F F F gt cavalry get stuck on your line gt F F gt horse whinies people die gt  days later youre the Emperor of Pendor,mountandblade,d97phqa,1,t5_2qzpd

They get random weapons but one of them is Heavy Lance they wont use it if theyre not charging on horseback others are Heavy Mace Elite Scimitar or Sarranid Cavalry Sword. Theoretically it means that they have  chance to spawn with blunt weapon but in practice almost all Mamlukes I have use Iron Mace.

9963312,0,t1_db61yl3,   Id highly recommend reworked personally. I found the expanded troops to be a little too many in number and while having a variety of troops can be fun for tactics I felt it lessened the impact of each side having advantages and disadvantages a little much. The reworked lets each factions unique troops shine while still providing a decent amount of variety in your troops to make an army as you please.   My reworked troop tree Nord playthroughs were always very fun. Generally I would amass a large amount of the standard infrantry route of the tree. I would order them into a realtively compact shield wall and generally stick to the point of a hill just below the crest. This allowed me to avoid a lot of ranged fire in the lead up to the forces meeting and prevented cavalry from getting that initial burst of speed to breakthrough a line of infantry. Once the enemy came over the crest of the hill my Nords short range but devastating throwing axes and throwing spears would blow through archers or shields. Once the enemy hit the wall my troops would easily cut them down.    Problems develop when you fight in more open territories like the desert or steppes and tiaga but quick thinking can make your shield wall a force to be reckoned with.,mountandblade,db68uq8,2,t5_2qzpd

10071261,0,t3_5jyuw2,As stated on the Taleworlds forums here  Step  flat reduction Reduceddamage basedamage  armor  soakfactor Step  percentage reduction Final damage   Reduceddamage     armor  reductionfactor There are  ways armor reduces damage. First it reduces it by a flat amount. This is equal to the armor value multipled by a soak coefficient which depends on damage type cut pierce blunt. Then you take that reduced number and reduce it by a percentage equal to the armor value multiplied by a reduction coefficient also different for cut pierce blunt.So lets take an example of  armor vs. an incoming swing that would do  cut damage to an unarmored target. Im going to use PoPs coefficients which are . for soak and . for reduction on cut.  Step  flat reduction Reduceddamage      .   Step  percentage reduction Final damage          .  So  damage gets through obviously armor is amazing vs. cutThe coefficients have I believe changed over time and are changed in various mods. The basedamage number as I understand it is the final damage after all skills velocity and location bonuses so it can be quite high. A good cut weapon wielded by someone with high Power Strike charging at you on a horse is still going to fuck you up in your full plate. ,mountandblade,dbkb3bg,7,t5_2qzpd

I prefer when you have to work more for money and cant easily cover all your costs without even trying.

I personally think getting beaten early on is part of the game. You need to get captured you need to see your men killed you need to lose those fancy new boots to bandits you need to be a mercenary and have your  recruits get demolished by a Marshals war party. You start off sucking and you get better. So thats my advice. Pick your battles and be patient. If you need money try tournaments or doing some quests for lords or guild masters. In time itll feel easier and youll lose a lot less often. ,mountandblade,de1q5wq,8,t5_2qzpd

10977263,0,t3_5wlnet,My first character TJ.  Hes the only character I played enough to conquer the whole world.  I swore fealty to Swadia.  I saved up money for enterprises as I fought in their wars.  They gave me one shitty village as a fief.  I think that it was called Rduna but I could be wrong.  It was the village between Halmar and the Vaeghirs.Soon enough I had a pretty sufficient army and a lot of money from quite a few enterprises.  Because of me Swadia became the largest faction on the map.  We were at war with the Khergits.  I singlehandedly captured Halmar and requested to have it as my fief.  King Harlaus denied it to me so I revolted and started my own faction with Halmar as my capital.  Before making peace with Swadia I captured the castle that controlled my original shitty village because I had spent so much time upgrading it and making the people there love me that I didnt want to let it go.Firentis my first companion became my first lord.  He was loyal to me and never betrayed me.  I gave him the castle I took from Swadia to get my shitty village back.  My first target was the Khergits.  I conquered Narra and took it as my own fief.  For the rest of the game I held Halmar Narra and my original shitty village as my fiefs but by now that shitty village wasnt so shitty anymore.  It was actually doing really well.I slowly expanded from there.  Going to war capturing a city or a castle or  before making peace and going to war with the next faction.  First I conquered all of the Khergits.  Then it was the Vaeghirs.  After that I took the Nords and then the Sarranids and the Rhodoks after that.  I saved Swadia for last.  I hadnt even touched them since I originally rebelled against them.  Finally I crushed them and became the king of all of Calardia.  It took about  days in the game but I really dragged it out and made the game last longer than it could have.,mountandblade,dec95kk,5,t5_2qzpd

10989456,0,t3_5wvbyk,So after playing a ton of mods here are my favorite featuresRecruiting BanditsMore interactions with bandits the ability to sell gear to the bandit hideouts when you have a low enough rep in VC is genius. Id love to see native mods do this. Just in a general sense anything that makes a different style of gameplay more viable and interesting particularly a dishonorable one makes the game more interesting mid game. The knighthood orders and minor factions as in Pendor the way theyre built in pendor meshes really well and the invasion mechanics with the ability to get quails gems is awesome. Plus running a massive army into Noldors and then joining the noldor side to fight is maybe the setting for my favorite battles in MampB yet. Also the challenges and rewards added to it qualis gems!! really make you just wanna keep playing the game forever.Anything that builds more economic options has to be balanced though. Like putting slaves to work in mines or buying land in cities and so on. There is so much gameplay to be had in building and maintaining financial empires. Again creates different styles of gameplay rather than just pure conquest.MampB is great but Ive always had a very hard time playing past late mid game because once I conquer my first city it just seems too easy or tedious... Basically I like the features that allow me to play as different types of characters or build an economic empire or anything that creates more challenges and rewards built into that part of the game. Oh and Freelancer! Thats a freaking genius feature. And ships and naval battles in VC. And the ability to upgrade weapons in VC Im surprised Ive not seen this anywhere else in native mods is it just too hard to code?.,mountandblade,dedmbyq,9,t5_2qzpd

Second option is like said elsewhere just have a lot of Ranged and let them pelt the enemy. Starving out the enemy might not be the best idea because of how long it takes.

11706169,0,t3_66z3nn,They keep holding it back wanting to fix more bugs and add more content. Seems like they are stuck in perfectionist mode  scope creep. They are constantly asked to release a version and patch it later since the current release is very buggy and laggyespecially when fast traveling. They arent planning on releasing it anytime soon and with their current mindset will either give up or just never release it.It looks to be in development hell to sum it up,mountandblade,dgmx4v7,9,t5_2qzpd
