970928,0,t1_chel7dj,He asked BMXQ where the money from Queensland Government grants was being spent because after viewing the state financial strategy plans the numbers werent adding up.BMX Australia have not said a word on the matter.With the way it happened he definitely hit a sore spot and BMXQ definitely doe not want to divulge where monies are being spent. Which to me means they arent being spent correctly and are possibly being abused in some way.,bmxracing,chenjzm,2,t5_2t6bj

8633843,0,t3_4y2uny,This is the qualifying format for BMX for those who are not familiar with it. For those who are familiar with World Cup qualifying the Olympic format has a few differences. Everyone does an individual time trial.  The men are seeded into quarters based on their time trial time. Women are seeded into semis.  Both quarters and semis are three rounds each. In qualifying rounds first place gets one point second place gets two points etc. The total points accumulated during the three rounds of quarters is added up. The four riders with the lowest points in each heat advance to semis. Semis work the same as quarters with the four lowest scores after three rounds advancing to finals. Finals is just one lap.One thing I am not sure about is if quarters and semis are scrambled or if they stay with the same people for the three rounds. Has anyone seen that info?,bmxracing,d6ku5xd,5,t5_2t6bj
