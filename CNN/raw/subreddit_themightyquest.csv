388968,0,t3_1yizlu,Either you happened to hit an unannounced maintenance period or the game didnt update for you right away after yesterdays patch.  Im connected now.  If problem persists try going into Steam amp opening the games properties and run verify cache.  Otherwise try an uninstall amp reinstall of the game if it isnt too much of a pain.,themightyquest,cfl2z07,1,t5_2vez2

464262,0,t1_cft0xpx,Cyclops bone puppeteers and defendotrons and also the elite versions of them as well helped me get through low level attacks. Also at low level I would recommend cramming most of your monsters into the boss room throne room the one with the treasure as that room allows more monsters to be aggroed onto the hero.,themightyquest,cft1doo,2,t5_2vez2
477672,0,t3_1zf1ep,gtAllow players to toggle onoff automatic shielding. Turning shields off also turns off hard castles becoming practice only.What if instead of implementing a forced practice only mode turning off the shield only disabled it for other players whove turned it off? Easymode players would still see everyones shield for better or worse but hardmode players could successfully raid each others castles as often as theyre able. Easymode players could still be raided by hardmode players and vice versa but they would still be subject to the shield. Turning your shield off is good because it gives you access to potentially unlimited loot. Its bad because it makes you vulnerable to potentially unlimited lootings. The decision to disable shields or leave them in place wouldnt have any effect on those who dont wish to use the feature but it also wouldnt prevent the two groups from interacting normally. Ideally you could see if a castle has its shields toggled before you attack it. Ideally the toggle would have a cooldown so that it cant be flipped on or off more than once or twice a day. ,themightyquest,cfukbjk,1,t5_2vez2

929860,0,t3_24qj87,YesYou can be raided by anyone at any level if you can see it in the region screen then you can raid it.You can try to store the resources but the more resources you have the more likely you are to be raided. I recommend upgrading the castle heart one level and then max everything little by little before the next castle upgrade.I dont follow any youtuber in particular and there are not much videos around most of them are from a while ago. The best way to learn is to attack and take note of what kills you because if it kills you then it can kill others or at least you can see in the replays how do the other players survive.,themightyquest,ch9z9wn,2,t5_2vez2
