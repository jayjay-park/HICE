610987,0,t1_cg9hnsr,I was obsessed with Poe and this story as a young writer so I might have set myself for something that would be easier for me than others  I am usually criticized for writing like this so I guess it helps get the overly verbose and long sentences out of my system.I used some of the exact same sentence structures as Poe. Its unedited so there are some repetition issues. I used hisor itself too much like heregta laterhand account itself was unthinkableI also repeated stretched in the same sentence... twice. I dont know how Poe edited his stories but I have a feeling these problems would be not be in his writing.I cut ahead near the end to finish writing though I could have gone on definitely. I just wanted to be done.Instead of the narrator being on a mountain hearing the story directly from the adventurer he is in his kitchen trying to tell the story he heard to his Mom in a way she will believe him. She thinks its madeup and like the narrator in A Descent into the Maelstrom isnt mentioned again in the end. I finished the story with quotations from the storyteller. But the difference is that the storyteller isnt the person who experienced it.I tried to make use of sentences with a bunch of clauses. This sentence is the same structure as one of PoesgtIf nobody believed me then surely no one believed the manthe space travelerthe one who reached deeply into the stretchedout purple blackness of the object known as Beta who only barely survived being stretched out in its spacetime barrel.Heres Poes version of the same sentencegtA boat picked me up exhausted from fatigue and now that the danger was removed speechless from the memory of its horror. Those who drew me on board were my old mates and dally companions but they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the spiritland. It isnt a precise match but I did do it from memory and also made it into just one sentence.Overall it needs editing but I dont want to! and I could elaborate on what happened INSIDE the wormhole which Poe does about the maelstrom. I gave my maelstrom a couple of different names like in aDitM and used the word barrel a few times like Poe,writers,cg9pzhw,1,t5_2r1ti

Yes many things werent completely predictable but the reader would know Chapter  time for the helper to pop up.Thats it Im calling and telling him to run with the original with the basic edits.

4242653,0,t3_39g3ix,A good first step is to reach out to an organization like It costs some money for a variety of different services but even for a minimum buy from them they can honestly tell you if youre book is ready for an agent. And they can go through a full edit with you for more.If you dont want to spend money totally understandable. Just check out agency websites. They often have a place for submissions.Agencies usually have a large backlog so you may not hear from them for awhile. If they like it but dont think its ready they may refer you to an organization like the ny book editors. If they like it and think its ready youll probably go through an edit or two with one of their agents before that agent starts submitting it to editors.Because this would be your first book that likely jr. editor would then have to probably convince their boss to place a bid.If youve got something really great your book can go to auction where multiple houses bid on it. then you can look forward to another round or three of edits from your new editor.Thats the general gist of the process. Good luck!Oh and try to find an agency with a track record in whatever kind of book youre  writing. Double oh! NY book editors are not agents theyre freelance editors. They dont submit your work to publishing houses.No legit agent or agency will charge you money to submit work or for their general services. They are strict commission and rights distribution only,writers,cs3uquz,2,t5_2r1ti

6564176,0,t3_45dbc0,Hi SharkeyInteresting piece there I like it and as far as creation myths go its pretty good I do have some observations. . You have made the cosmology of the your world for now lets include the observable aspects of the universe such as stars and other planets as part of any characters understanding of the world inherently feminine. This I like Patriarchal myths boo hiss!!!. However it is missing a lot of material Its a start for sure it establishes the source of creation as female. However you need to add more detail and heres why. Take just about any earthern mythology and you will find that the act of creation itself is only one among many stories that establish the relationship between heavenand hell typically. So now youve got the creation bit out of the way for more interlinked tales and myths need to come into play. You mentioned somewhat undefined players in your mythology as the Scepturi and that there nature is crystalline.  Thats fine but not to put not to fine a point what if any is there gender. Are they in any sense to be regarded as human archteypes? I am not clear if they are objects or if they are regardless of appearance and form some kind of person. Are they subject to the same strengths or weaknesses inherent in the human condition. to be honest it is important since how a character in your story regards them and or interacts with them and the creator herself. So it seems to me now that you have made the source of all things feminine more myths are needed to account for the presence and or cosmologicalethical role of the male of the species. Are the myths of the coming of men necessary for your story  I ask because for all I know the species of beings that there myths contain may not require a role for men that sadly those of us born to a patriarchal system cant help but avoid So you have alot to tease out there in terms of creating a substantive account of both creation as an act of will and the role gender itself will play in the myths and the kind of ethics they instill in those who believe it. Just a quick note about background got a basic degree in Anthropology and philsophy. Fascinated by the role of myth in societies both familiar and exotic. I intend someday to put my own myths down on paper someday so Im curious to see how your attempt plays out. I believ many fantasies stand or fall on the way the protagonists and antagonists relate to the myths they share or are in conflict about. For instance does a another faction  religious or political have another mythology or a diametrically opposed interpretation?. Anyway hope those thoughts were useful to you I like what I see so far I look forward to reading more if you post so keep me in the loop happy to provide you with any critiques that might be of help.   ,writers,czyagz9,1,t5_2r1ti
6662239,0,t1_d089dsd,I agree that there arent very many self published authors out there pulling down the big bucks but the fact that they are out there shows that A It can be done. And BSelf publishing does sell. However I would like to point out that Amazon doesnt have the stats for what authors make through Kobo iBooks GooglePlay etc so while they might have some good data they dont have the full picture. Dont get me wrong I think theyre very close on numbers but since they are a publisher with several imprints I tend to take everything they say with a grain of salt.  Selfpublishing is definitely a slow burn process so you need money to live while chasing the dream. It also depends on the genre you write as to how slow a burn it can be. Kids books being one of the slowest earners and romance titles generally being the quickest. But it comes down to how much you work for it not necessarily how much you spend on it. You also have to know the right places to spend money. k is ridiculous to spend,writers,d08fl52,1,t5_2r1ti

Ultimately its still up to you. Alright here I goI was a bit confused as to why when Jamice was asked about what his uncle policeman had to say the next dialog was not in any way an answer. So it can be a bit confusing to tell if that was Janice avoiding the question or someone else speaking.Next thing that caught my attention was the I know right!. Right from Welp I was guessing that you were going for a casual student conversation but I think I know right? would look better. You could still add the additional exclamation point if you want.After the morning bell you used your chance instead of my chance.First scene with Fred I think brushed Fred off is better that brushed off Fred.Talking with Fred Well its not really near nearby isnt it?  I just think you should italicize the first near.I wasnt altogether surprised at Fred taking off or at the teacher from before poking his head.. I feel that the or at the middle is off. There really wasnt a choice in that sentence so I think or isnt the correct word to use. Since youre using altogether you could change or to and to indicate that the two actions in combination is what altogether is referring to.At the cafeteria the first time the leader spoke you used you again instead of me or us but as others have already pointed that out I wont write any more comments about it.Random feedback I was imagining the leader as a guy but when you used her that was a fun surprise. Nice.Hmm the description of the school bus is something you can omit. I believe people are aware that school buses take students from their home to the school and vice versa.Talking with Janice after going to the washroom I think you forgot to delete the second was from this sentence I was thinking about what I heard was in the newspaper..Last paragraph This phrase was weird when I heard it in my head I wasnt buying anything maybe you can change it to Im not going to buy any of itthat?Anyway thats about everything I could say.

First its a lot for the reader to remember and its uneventful being told about history. I think it better to let the reader experience and learn the history through your characters. Another thing I noticed is when you write the hunters skills were so adept that he knew there was no one else. Rather than writing that you could try writing exactly what skills he used or how he knew them. Like the absence of human footsteps outside the clearing or he circled the camp once to ensure no surprises awaited him. I think specificity is supreme because although you know which skills he used your reader doesnt.

The entire iceberg is what YOU know about this world. The part above the water is what you put in the book. And that part is best revealed through characters and plot.When I read your synopsis I was fighting to stay interested until I hit  Donandrux decides to find an alien race terraform their world enslave its inhabitants and force them to farm it. . I quite literally only cared about ANY of the stuff you wrote out after I read that line. The worldbuilding is a large part of why people write scifi and fantasy. But getting readers to care about it is rooted in good characters and good story. If I take what you just said this is a shorter version that would get me to read moreIn a distant galaxy a crumbling empire led by a desperate monarch seek to conquer a new home Earth. Mark Smith was as ordinary as his name. Until the day he discovered that he was humanitys only hope to stop Donandrux and the Malgur Empire from destroying Earths civilization.Reframing your story and I know I probably messed up the details but the point remains that way suddenly gives the reader a reason to care. All of those millions of details youve been thinking of become answers to questions I only ask because I care about what happens to the characters.As far as help with the actual writing youre probably unlikely to find that help. The simple reality is that most of the people interested in writing to explore your idea actually already have their own ideas. Im working on a novel at the moment myself but have notesoutlines for another half a dozen that I havent had time for.The writing partnerships Ive seen or heard of nearly always came from either established writers deciding to work together on an idea they come up with together or from people in a writing group who decide to collaborate. This is your idea and the world youve been thinking about for years. No one else is going to do it justice.To sum up it really is worth your time to watch that entire series of lectures and apply what he says to your idea.
