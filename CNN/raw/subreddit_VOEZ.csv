7947651,0,t3_4o3sjt,yeah this game is super tight on timing like o!m and sightreading feels harder than usual. Like joint notes have to be very close together to both get perfectmax perfect and it takes a fair amount of dexterity to sync up two hits with different hands to the level required for MPI can only come close to a full max perfect when Im purely playing on gut instinct I cant be confident Ill be able to play a song blind like in other RTGschanging my offset to .s seems to be helping a lot but of course everyones mileage varies when it comes to offsetsthe answer for both of us is probably just play more but I think practicing finger play is a great idea,VOEZ,d49e2re,3,t5_39g1n
