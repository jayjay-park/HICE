279745,0,t1_cf9r2wh,See how bad the situation is? She lets out a fabricated sighThe Arc project was supposed to be a secret. Then its snatched from under our noses by a gang of criminals. We managed to track some of them down but then the project leaves the Fire Nation and our trail goes cold. The only thing we managed to learn is that it was brought to this city by a man Fire Nation and somehow connected to the Pro Bending Arena.She looks over at you trying to interpret your reactions. Now the problem is that there are hundreds of men of Fire Nation birth who works compete or is in any other way connected to their business. Now of course we do not have any suspects. But it would help Mr. Hakai if you could tell us where you have been the last few months. And if anyone can confirm your story.,TheAvatarRP,cf9rb3g,1,t5_2zms6
