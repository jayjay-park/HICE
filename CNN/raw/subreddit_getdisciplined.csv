Who wants to be angry and fearful the rest of your life? This is absolutely not how I live nor how I achieve my goals. My motivators are selfsatisfaction andor competition either with others or with myself. gtThe best way to become disciplined is to be forced.The best way to be disciplined is to have a goal you want to attain. If you are forced to do anything you become resentful and eventually reject it unless the goal becomes your own.gtTo become a better person you must first destroy the current one. I disagree entirely. You build upon what you currently are. That may mean rejecting some of your current habits but without knowing what doesnt work you will never know what does work. Even the Marines have this nonsensical myth that they break down the person into nothing and them build them up to a Marine. Even that is false. The Marines break down the civilian habits and instill a military bearing in their Marines. They dont destroy the person.gtIf youre not feeling some sort of physical or emotional pain on a daily basis you can try harder.I guess I can understand the physical pain for a workout.

109979,0,t1_ceqy0wn,I had cognitive therapy for a few months. It didnt click with the therapist but I have learned one valuable lesson my brain isnt always right.Regardless of whether or not you believe in one universally true truth your brain can be trained to believe whatever. This works for negative things like how victims of abuse often feel guilty while nothing at all is their fault if anyone who has been abused is reading this forget about your feelings every single thing you felt and did regarding your abuse is natural and nothing is your fault tell someone! but also for positive things like I can do these  pushups today.A way to find out whether or not your beliefs are reasonable is to really question them. For example people often say I cant handle this pressure I cant go through with this or Its not useful to do this right now like when you wake up at am because you set the alarm to go running because you felt inspired to do so last night. Lets take that last one apart in a way you would during cognitive therapy Step  Define the thesis that is in your head in very basic terms. For example I cant handle this situation. Step  Ask yourself question  Is that right?. Just go with whatever pops into your head as a first reply. gt Yeah of course its right! I have a test tomorrow and I have no clue what to study. All I have is a .pptx file with  slides full of keywords that I cant find any structure in. How the hell am I supposed to make sense of that and deal with this? Step  Ask yourself question  Is that really right?. Think in simple basic needs. In the beginnings of doing this exercise this will be a sighcringeworthy answer for most of you. Thats fine. gt Well maybe not. Im still here. Im breathing. Im sitting on this chair doing fine and I dont even have a cough. Step  Verbalize the antithesis. Think of a statement that is the opposite of your original thesis. Again if this is sighcringeworthy to you thats fine. Do it anyway. Your brain too is clich like this even if youre a badass cynic. gt The antithesis is I can handle this situation. Step  Internalize the antithesis and act on it. Now you can go and be productive about your problemsolving.Works if you apply it seriously and regularly.E words.,getdisciplined,ceqycen,20,t5_2uzju

124933,0,t3_1vigny,You are choosing the wrong kind of exercise if its making you breathless and upsetting  its easy to feel that it has to be hard and punishing to be effective especially with that insanity dvd program and similar being promoted really heavily recently. For people who have a difficult relationship with food and emotional attachments i.e. eating for reasons other than hunger then it isnt  diet and  exercise. Food will always be the more difficult challenge as that relationship is explored and its not something you can quit like other comforting addicting things like smoking or coffee or whatever. So heres my advice for you to succeed. Track what you eat but reset your  hour period from the conventional if thats what it takes. Eat enough to maintain your current size by working out the figures using calculators available for BMRBasal Metabolic Rate or RMRResting Metabolic Rate and BMI. Use ones which use an activity level and set it for sedentary.Now heres the exercise bit  you stand up and you walk on the spot. You can do it whilst watching tv whilst cooking whilst rocking baby any pacing around the place. Dont go up and down stairs put on special clothes or equipment. Just walk on the spot. Going out for walks is awesome too but that requires more effort and planning. For your arms just bend them like a bicep curl  no weight needed as often as you can through the day. Over the course of a week doing this during ad breaks or downtime between tasks will add up to hundreds more movements. I was able to eat within my calorie range for  years and maintain a good weight because of walking and arm exercises. No miracle gym membership just walking and being more active. I wasnt hungry and I wasnt grumpy. Ive only gained weight due to a medical reason and Im getting treatment for that now and fully expect to return to my old weight using this method. ,getdisciplined,cesnpml,2,t5_2uzju

166166,0,t1_cdah4af,i just ran across this post via another this is excellent advice ryan.  you hit on a lot of points that tie back to ancient tradition and mythology which remain in our consciousness over millennia for one reason they are true.   i think you should consider publishing an essay with these pearls... given the tremendous feedback youve clearly hit a nerve.  based on my own experience i would add one other thesis zero negative.  the idea being that when ones mind wanders into negative thinking about oneself others world events realize and circumvent that thougt stream as quickly as possible and switch it off by reaffirming that we all have our ups and downs our own good side and bad thats core to the human condition so we shouldnt dwell on past mistakes we can only try to do better right now... be your own hero.  this goes back to your point on selfforgiveness and forgiveness of others which is crucial.  the difference this action can make is profound rather than dwelling in regret and selfloathing focus on what is good and what positive actions we can take going forward.  in forming this habit we can immediately redirect our energy from negative to positive in the moment.  over time this will result in huge positive gains not only for ourselves but also in the grand scheme.  as the buddhists say enlightenment comes one mind at a time. quantum physics also affirms this possibility reality is a strange trip.  thanks again for the post im sure youve had a very positive impact on many people and there is probably no greater gift we can give.  ,getdisciplined,cexcy04,4,t5_2uzju

Are you asking if I have a job in addition to my PhD?gt What you call unpleasant should be the most rewarding and pleasurable work.Well although I personally chose the topic of my PhD I had no idea itd be this hard to tackle mostly because it involves a completely different area of study than what Ive been working on until now.IIRC optimal productivity occurs at a level of challenge slightly above ones skill level and I feel the challenges Im dealing with in my PhD are above mine by a lot. That makes the rewarding moments of this work i.e. satisfaction from achievement amp accomplishment be much rarer than in my previous experience.gt Assuming you are doing something useful aimed at a goal you desire.I do desire this goal because besides being a topicfield well worth working on and one I had been curious about for a long time I also love learning and teaching too if my limited past experiences in that regard are any indicator and a PhD degree is a solid step in the direction of a career as an educator.What seems to cause the lack of pleasure is simply the hardness of the work coupled with my inability to overcome it because I expect to be driven simply by my intrinsic reward system. In other words my extrinsic motivation system is underdeveloped.Hence my conclusion that I need to come to terms with the fact that the work I do isnt supposed to be always rewarding.,getdisciplined,cf1jwff,1,t5_2uzju

Occasionally Ill find myself possessed by passion and motivation and when I do it seems like I can accomplish anything. They arent manic episodes or anything I just find these kernels of motivation and then I lose them. Everyone has always had more faith in me than I have in myself even though I truly believe deep down that I could accomplish great things I dont believe that I really will.For me though the biggest challenge is finding goals and a direction. Ive been out of undergrad for  years now and though I was originally planning on going back to school Ive only been working deadend jobs trying to decide what I want to do with my life.

To be honest when I read your post I see you as either someone who just has no care at all up until though or someone who may have a learning deficit like ADD.

Think about it this way  those professors want to show that they have good students who are enthusiastic and involved so they can show you off to colleagues prospective students etc.  So if you show interest they are usually willing to help you.   Its like this  every organization wants a golden boy right?  Often times that golden boy isnt nearly the best in the field theyre just the one who wants it the most.  Just show that you want it and people will help you.   Same thing for awards and stuff.  I used to get nervous applying for fellowships awards internships etc. but then I realized my applications dont have to be close to perfect because those organizations are just excited to give away awards and such.

What do you think of the idea of setting up a commitment device to enforce a predefined limit on how many hours per week you can spend playing? RescueTimeBeeminder is my highly biased suggestion for how to do that.Or you could attack it from the other direction and have a commitment device to spend say  hoursweek working and studying and then fill as much of the remaining time with video games as you like.

1160914,0,t3_27echz,I would have to concur with this.For a while I was doing what I do with the goal of Doing good for my family and for those that are needing a steppingstone to get into the gamedev industry... And though that motivation was helpful for the short term I started to resent the work that I was doing which was a shock since Ive been passionate about making games for a long time. It became a slog and I had to constantly tell myself Remember who youre doing this for to keep the steam on.Then after a bit of a breakdown and having a potentially calamitous event happen... Broken hand my drawing hand... and since Im more an artist than a programmer that could have spelled the end of my aspirations. I did a lot of thinking about it and I realized that I wanted to do what I want because I want to be well off if not rich. I know that gamedevelopment wont likely make me rich unless I manage to get a sleeper hit made that sells well into the millions over its lifetime but making the realization that I want to be wealthy changed everything.Now I actually look forward to the work I have to do because its something thats going to directly benefit me. Sure I still want to use the wealth I hope to earn to do good things for both my family and my peers but thats secondary to the desire to have wealth.... The hardest thing however was breaking out of the conditioning that actively seeking wealth was inherently bad or greedy or selfish. That took some work because its not hard to see how theres a culture of shame surrounding people that have wealth the occupy movement is a big example that perfectly highlights some of what I mean. But you know what? Some words I read on a blog a while ago helped me realize that the people that actually BECOME wealthy are the ones that are selfish. Not in the evil kinda way more just an acceptance that what they want is the good life. So doing all this for me though it might seem selfish and greedy has helped me to break through this veneer of social acceptability and really get my gears turning getting the shit done that I need to get done to get what I want.Theres no shame in being selfish... In fact its actually kinda our natural state. We always want the good things in life because those represent an easier life in a sense... A freedom of sorts... So in that respect every single one of us are selfish in a sense. Sure we may not be sociopathic in our drive to get what we want but at the core selfish behaviour is tied very closely to our sense of selfpreservation and embracing your selfishness isnt inherently evil as long as we remember to maybe do good things with the things we want.Being selfish is okay as long as its not depriving others unfairly. You can get the good stuff and have a wealthy life and still be a good person. Hell just look at Bill Gates. One of the wealthiest people in the world and hes used his wealth to do a TON of great things to benefit humanity. Hes insanely rich but hes certainly not evil. ,getdisciplined,ci07yzs,2,t5_2uzju

Every dollar that doesnt already have a job should be going there  dont even worry about saving at this point because youre hemorrhaging money until the CCs are paid off. Right now do whatever you need to do to make that happen even if that means a parttime gig at Starbucks for a while. Your career advancement will have to wait  that kind of debt is an emergency.The good news is that with a sixfigure income you should be able to pay it off quickly if you treat it with the seriousness it deserves.

Your mindmap has a neat layout though it focuses on many negative things.To begin with if you are having suicidal thoughts visit rsuicidewatch find someone to talk to either through reddit a friend or a hotline. Sharing your burdens is important.Upon seeing all the negative aspects of your life in a collection like that its hard to see where the possibility for improvement is. In reality you do these things in sequences one bad habit at a time. You have to focus on quitting one bad habit and letting the other remain for a while. As you surpress one bad habit you will need to fill it with a good habit instead. If you dont do this the other bad habits may just increase and take the old habits place. Start but start simple.Where do you want to begin? What habit is the biggest obstacle right now? Which habit could you get rid of easily? Some bad habits could easily work in moderation but others become addictions. Do you recognize these?Your seem very focused on our negative habits but remember this what you focus on grows.

1504056,0,t3_2bekn2,I struggled with this in high school.  There was no magic formula that fixed me but there were a couple of things that helped out immensely  Changed my environment  I had a chance to move in with my dad parents were divorced.  It was a major change and it was a good one.  I had a new perspective on my life and the world in general.  Some would say this is running away from your problem  I beg to differ.  Depression is about you and dealing with it is simply you taking care of yourself.  If youre in a place that makes you depressed  get out of there.I had new routines new friends and it made a difference.  It wasnt the magic wand fix but it helped.  I will sometime lay down on the floor and look at the world as if Im upside down the floor is the ceiling.  It will give you an immediate different view on life. Meditation  Shouldnt sound so strange nowadays  it sort of was in early s where I lived.  It helped to take away the emotions and focus on being positive.  I really wish I would do this more nowadays. Exercise  Youll feel good and later on youll start to look good. Break your routine  If you come home and have things you have to do  like watch a particular TV show eat dinner at the same time eat the same thing be in bed by a certain time etc. maybe its time to change ALL of it.  Dont go home right away go for a long drive.  Listen to your favorite music.  Go see more of the world  eat when you feel hungry.  Buy something youve always wanted.  Even if you are on a budget or just flat out broke you need to treat yourself to something.  I call it sanity maintenance and believe it  you need it no matter what your income level. Revisit your past the good stuff  embrace your past mostly the good stuff even some of the bad.  Remember who you are and where you came from.  It will motivate you to get to your goaldream.  Like Sammy Davis Jr. said Show me a man without a dream and Ill show you a man thats dead  real dead.  Have that dream baby! Reconcile your world.  By that I mean youve changed or maybe you just found yourself and you need to reset your routines and your life.  Look at it like youve pulled everything out of your house or apartment  cleaned it all up and are moving the things you want back in.  You can decide what you want to bring back and what to leave out.  Hopefully by that point youll be focused and ready to lay down good routines and discipline.Depression is like alcoholism in some ways.  Youll always been somewhat prone to it  hell some part of you may even like it in some ways.  You need to be careful and remember what happens that triggers these things.  Remember what to do.  Dont romanticize it music tended to do it for me I avoid those songs sometimes.The above worked for me several times in fact  maybe it could work for you.

I forgive you.Itll feel a little silly at first and it wont make any bad feelings go away but over time it really helps.I should also note that feeling guilt and shame after a mishap is not a bad thing! Guilt and shame are social emotions that let us know that something has gone wrong and they help us remember to not do that thing in future  very important! If someone cannot feel guilt or shame theyre a psychopath or autistic or have some other disorder. Rumination causes us to draw out these feelings past the point of usefulness  so while it is not wise to try and eliminate these feelings entirely moderation is key.,getdisciplined,ck8igbz,1,t5_2uzju

1959571,0,t1_ckpblef,Thanks for the reply. Let me slightly tweak my advice and see if its more what youre looking for. One thing Ive been trying this year to deal with the exact problems youre describing is picking one day a week where I do not open my laptop. Ive been doing this for about six weeks and the day Ive picked is Sunday because I wont be at work from  in front of a computer. I found this has been pretty successful in getting me to do noncomputer related things like read books listen to music while cooking work out etc. Just getting used to the idea that I can be entertained outside of a computer has been important. I find its making me better at consciously turning off the computer on other days of the week as well. Id suggest you give it a shot. Again I think its about convincing yourself that you can break the habit even if its only for a day a week to start. Eventually I think youll notice a difference in your ability to manage that behaviour on all of the other days of the week as well. ,getdisciplined,ckpbwnz,12,t5_2uzju

We also get rewarded that person says good on you. Because we feel like weve had progress and we feel like we have received the reward we lose drive to actually do the thing. Here is an article on it that links through to the original study The exception for me is accountability. I will share my goals if I believe the person Im sharing the goal with will help me stay accountable e.g. the current October challenge.I also dont like telling people about my goals unless I am well on the way to them anyway as I dont want to feel fake.,getdisciplined,clbr1ba,5,t5_2uzju

What Ive been trying to do lately is tell myself that certain habits morning runs are nonnegotiable. Thus every time I start thinking about sleeping in and making up exercise later or taking a rest day a little voice basically says dont try to talk yourself out of this. It usually works.This strategy fails when another activity interferes with the habit. E.g. waking up early is dependent on getting a good nights sleep when I dont sleep on time I wake up late and dont run in the morning. The solution is simple but so far its very hard to make  hours of sleep nonnegotiable.,getdisciplined,clfnnxl,3,t5_2uzju

2208102,0,t3_2kdn4h,I recently discovered that autohiding the taskbar helps a lot by removing all the distracting icons from my field of view. Ive also read some books on habits and something as simple as seeing a chrome or firefox icon can subconsciously trigger a desire or even a craving to visit a website that you find rewarding. Also I actually completely disagree about the benefits of the pomodoro systemIve tried it several times also because it creates a distracting environment because youre now constantly checking it wondering how much time you have left. Also the pomodoro system cements the rewarding behavior of checking internet ect whatever you do when you procrastinate by offering you these consistent  minute breaks.Your true goal should be to find your work rewarding itself to the point where you dont want a break. So autohiding the taskbar also solves that problem of constantly checking the time by getting rid of your clock. Dont think about time just try to get lost in whatever you need to do. Forget about the outside world. that is the goal. Anything that reminds you about the outside world is a distraction. In regards to stopping bad habits and creating good habits the one book I cannot recommend enough is The Power of Habit Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business  It can change your life. ,getdisciplined,clki5a3,2,t5_2uzju

Write down the entire goal everything that must be done at the end.. Think about the order in which things must occur and the time necessary for them.. Draw columns for the number of weeks you have available and write the work to be done into each column. Move them around until your weeks are balanced.. Draw  columns for each week and write in what must be done on each day.  instead of  because you will inevitably hit obstacles or procrastinate and need the weekend to finish your weekly goals.. Print out a calendar with big boxes and write in your daily tasks. Put this up where you can see it from your desk or work space.. Every day after your morning routine sit at your desk and look at your calendar. Copy down your tasks for the day on a piece of paper on your desk. Rewriting the tasks reinforces in your mind what you plan to accomplish for the day. Cross them off as you complete them. This feels satisfying. . Plan your breaks and set a timer for them. Set the timer on your phone for one hour. When it goes off wrap up what you are doing and set your timer for  minutes. During your break stand up eat a snack browse reddit and screw around with no guilt. When your timer goes off set it for one hour and go back to work.

So I finetuned the track order made it as compelling as I could and really looked for a label that would be interested in that type of music. I mean I just looked at it like I really want this and I want my daughter to have something she can be proud that her father did. And once you get that first thing out into the world suddenly you get this confidence  because when other people around you see that a publisherlabelgallery etc. is backing your work they see that youre serious. So that provides confidence too. The hardest part for me was getting to that place where someone wanted to put my work out there.

And thats when we started talking againSo DONT contact her after this is my first advice. Id invite her to movies buy her things she couldnt afford since she was too busy spending all her money on drugs now... DONT backslide dont keep seeing her. Dont buy her things or take her places to prove to her dating you was awesome. It wont work. Then she told me she just wasnt ever going to date me and seeing me was weird. So I cried. A little. You can cry. Then I drank a lot. You can drink... But just a little. Then I proceeded to have sex with every girl I could. It seemed like a good idea at the time. The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else.  Not everyone else. Pick out a girl looking for a little fun. Proceed to have an incredible casual non exclusive relationship.

So thats something.  I think Im on the brink of entering a slump motivationwise so Ive gotta try and resist and push myself through it. Ive had moments like this in the past where I have a period of motivation and then...I just get lazy and stop. I dont want that to happen this time. pAnyway have a good weekend everybody!,getdisciplined,clwejsk,1,t5_2uzju

2337147,0,t1_cm09ep9,A couple days ago I did mostly move out of boxes.  I moved most of my dishes and food supplies over to the kitchen area and I took all my clothing out of boxes and hung most of it up.  I still need to actually try on and sort through all my clothes and decide what I need and what I dont.  Going to the gym almost every single day sometimes multiple times like in the morning for my own workout then later for a class I accumulated a lot of athletic clothes and wore almost all of them.  But now if Im hardly exercising I dont need  pairs of pants and  shirts.That does give me an idea.  Rather than just knowing that I should clean my room because normal people dont like living in disorganized chaos I want to clean my room so that I can do yoga here.  The groupons yes I stupidly bought two before I even tried it once I got were for hot yoga which I cant stand and thats part of the reason Im so hesitant to go back. I want to just be able to watch youtube videos and do roomtemperature yoga in my own place.,getdisciplined,cm0l1cn,1,t5_2uzju

Its essentially just more serotonin being produced in your brain. For the first month or so you feel absolutely terrible but after that you gradually get better.i got fits of rage i was probably qualified to be in a mental hospital for the first  weeks of taking them hearing voices and shit. But now? Im fine. Im on mg and soon it will be increased to  and possibly mg in which case i will get even better.anti depressants have worked miracles on me. Not only is my mood lifted but my anxiety and ocd has reduced A LOT and i only had one session of therapy so far just discussing stuff whats been going on etc.maybe your father was like most of the other people on the internet who shit on anti depressants. maybe he took them for only a short period of time and not giving them a chance to work. of course anti depressants will fuck with your mind its a load of foreign serotonin which your brain isnt used to having. after a few weeks you will see benefits though.,getdisciplined,cm51od6,1,t5_2uzju

Finding a way to do that is a whole question of its own. Alarm clock away from the bed sleep cycles lots of water before bed whatever works.Once you spend a few days up early you will feel tired earlier too.

2486177,0,t3_2o0rln,Youll get through this youve probably been here before right?I totally know that feeling. I still deal with it a lot especially how to look at my relationship with my girlfriend. Sometimes it feels like shes just another energy sink for me and I think one of the best moves I make while depressed is changing that perspective. She is happy to become a pillar of my mental health if I give her the chance. One of my tricks of the trade with depression is doing little things until I forget my feelings for a moment and can start climbing back up to positivity. For example I sat in bed this morning for about two hours  pretty unproductive  so I decided I need to go to the bathroom. No nothing came out but after I was done I put on some clothes grabbed my recycling bin and drove down to the recycling station even though I could just put them by the curb.

2510582,0,t3_2od9lj,You cant work all the time. You need blank time where you do nothing to let ideas gel lessons consolidate and so on. Its important for creativity and motivation.Problems arise when people engage in enjoyable activities that dont actually allow for this sort of recovery. In psych people are starting to research soft fascination  just chilling out and taking stuff in which seems to help people recover mentally. This can be looking at nature or people watching etc.Unfortunately what most of us do  surf the internet or play competitive online games and process a lot of useless information  does not seem to have that same positive effect. You arent working but you arent really recovering either! Nor are you thinking idly about the things you care about letting creativity run about. I personally call this hard fascination but thats not a real term as of yet. TLDR its OK to get tired by too much work. You need empty spaces of time to just chill to be maximally productive and creative and good sleep too. Just make sure you spend your free time in ways that allow you to recover and feel good. ,getdisciplined,cmm9s2o,35,t5_2uzju

3252627,0,t3_2xbpig,The same thing happened to me as I started this journey a little over a month ago. My fiance and I noticed a rift rising between us in the past few weeks and last weekend we had a pretty big fight about it. I definitely had become very absorbed in myself and improving in all these ways that I had started silently mocking those around me that were doing less. My fiance noticed this and led her to losing self esteem. After I realized what I had done I had a very similar reaction. This week weve been keeping in touch more spending time together as part of our daily habits and taking time away from our tasks for each other. Its quite an improvement. I would add that while taking ten minutes and complimenting her are great ways to start your significant other should be one of your top priorities. Ive lessened the amount on my daily task list because I dont want to cheat my time with her.

3291091,0,t3_2xsvzv,For the gym Right after work every day. I struggle with time management and have to cram the gym into my life. I also struggle with a deep love for sleep and extreme fatigue during the day. For the fatigue I drink lots of coffee on the days I need it but I try and stay away unless its truly necessary. I know going right after work would be tough but in doing so you get it out of the way early in the night plus you get a nice endorphin rush during and after especially in the post workout shower...mmmm which might help with just feeling better overall! You might also want to look into multivitamins even if its just a placebo effect whatever works for you. Learning another language can be hard and the best way to do so is to immerse yourself in another culture. That may be hard right off the bat so try studying a little bit  min every day. Youll be amazed how much you pick up even after the first day!Video games are great fun but too much of anything is no good.

This instant gratification does not exist in that many activities. Also games usually have a steeper learning curve they are easier to get involved with. A gamer can pick up any game and play it decently. You cant pick up a guitar or start painting and expect to be decent until after many hours.

After work I am drained and dont feel like doing anything productive. Instead I would play videogames or watch movies mind numbing activities. I also tended to binge on sweets frequently in the evening because I was bored and told myself I needed the sugar to have energy for my productive projects. Instead I binge ate which ruined my diet made me even more sluggish and unproductive.  To fix it I went to sleep about an hour or  after work so around PM and started waking up at AM. This gave me about  hours of MAX productivity projects working out researching etc. This makes my day very productive but I also get weird looks when people find out I wake up at AM.

Maybe you can find out what of those is making you wander off and work on that? You could scan the text and filter out the important stuff too. Or break down big syllabuses into smaller parts. Sometimes you dont need all of the info just the ones e.g. for solving a problem.

3759650,0,t1_cqkoqxs,Like the other poster said grammar is not the hard part of Mandarin. Although it is a relatively challenging language I would personally rank it below Japanese in difficulty due to the differences in the way characters are used and the ease of grammar. As was mentioned pronunciation is much more important in Mandarin than say Japanese. There are some good materials for this around the internet but I cant remember which ones Ive seen recommended. It is something you need to start practicing from the very beginning. As far as I see it you have two options regarding writing and reading. If you want to learn to write it is very very useful to learn to write the Hanzi characters separately. Remembering the Hanzi book by Heisig is great for this purpose. The method uses mnemonics to help you memorize the writing system relatively fast. As an added bonus you also learn to recognize the characters from each other as well as some meanings attached to them but you will not be capable of reading Chinese only with this resource. I have personally finished the Remembering the Kanji book by the same author and it helped me immensely especially considering Japanese kanji can be even a bigger pain in the butt to learn.The second option is forgoing writing for the time being and using a program like Anki to learn words using the hanzi characters. Because you are not familiar with the characters it will be very difficult at first. You also havent gotten to know the characters by doing the Heisig book so in all honesty you will have a big challenge ahead you will be learning a the characters b the spellingpronunciation and c the meaning of the word simultaneously. On the other hand this approach may help you to start readinglistening to native materials faster. If you did the Heisig book first then you would know the characters already and would only need to learn the meaning and spellingpronunciation making the task a lot easier. What is good about Mandarin is that the characters often have only one pronunciation as well as meaning! so there is little need to guess how a single character is pronounced or what it might mean. When you learn it once you know it. This is not the case in Japanese where a single kanji may have  different pronunciations while the words often have little to do with the kanji in question. This is why bruteforcing the words in Mandarin should be easier. Of course we need to remember that Chinese uses more characters than Japanese something like  vs. . This may seem like a big deal but in my experience it isnt. Once you know  characters its incredibly easy to just keep going to learn the other . The hard part is getting to know the characters initially. Later on you learn to see small details easier and thats what youll be doing a lot since all hanzikanji consist of relatively few patternsradicals. Not to mention you might see an exponential effect on your vocabulary after some point considering Chinese is full of words that are simply compounds of the hanzi you already know. The hanzi compounds also make many words very easy to remember e.g. Mercury is simply water planet.Whatever you do I advise you to not be afraid of the hanzi and just start tackling them from the very beginning rather than trying to use only pinyin or something. They are not so hard to learn only time consuming. You might soon learn that they are quite useful and that it is better to have them than not!,getdisciplined,cqktt7a,1,t5_2uzju

3776512,0,t3_33nty8,I feel the need to comment because I myself am female and struggle with the same issue. As of now I usually shower as soon as I wake up. It helps me transition. If I washed my hair I almost always let my hair air dry. This was not always the case I lived and breathed by my hair appliances. But I learned to love my hair the way it is naturally. Ill spray a little bit of dry shampoo on my wet clean roots what?!? try it sometime it adds texture and volume to it! and then Im good in the hair arena. Speaking of learning to like my natural appearances I finally cleared my skin of its blemishes thanks to a facial cleansing brush! so now I am more comfortable with not wearing face makeup. I will apply eye make up concealer liner mascara and run a little bit of blush over my cheeks and thats it! I only go all out with makeup like if Im going out which is never.The night before I check the weather for the next day and get an idea of what Im going to wear so come tomorrow I generally know what clothes Im going to reach for. But I dont by any means lay my clothes out. I find that kind of unnecessary.As for breakfast I dont eat breakfast! Its something that works for me. I know a lot of people discourage skipping breakfast but Ive heard it all before. I dont know Ive always been this way but I maintain a healthy living otherwise!Thats my routine as far as getting ready goes I believe thats what you were looking for. Other people incorporate reading walking meditating creativity into their morning but I am just not at that level yet. Best of luck and if you take away anything from my post it should probably be that I used to organize my morning routine around applying makeup and doing my hair which would be an hour of my time minimum but I just learned that there are more important things in life and people dont care about your looks as much as you worry that they do. xoxo,getdisciplined,cqmr0ms,-2,t5_2uzju

3907778,0,t3_357fx5,Ah best of luck with your AS levels! The benefit of AS levels is that the exams tend to be quite repetitive and are going to test creativity less than a STEP exam for example. So if you can do past papers under exam conditions youll probably be cool. Onto the anxiety. I recommend you spend a short time meditating in the week leading up to the exam and even when youre in the exam hall. Just focus on your breathing and let all your thoughts just pass through your head. Youll notice that after a while that the anxiety will leave if you dont latch onto it. More often than not we put ourselves into a feedback loop of Im nervous  i cant do this  this question is difficult  i cant do this  Im even more nervous. Attempting to break the loop by spending a few seconds focusing on your breathing youll be able to go back to thinking about the exam. Now heres an important part. Have confidence in your abilities. Youve done well in past exam papers which means that you have the skills to do certain things presuming you havent just memorised techniques which is evidence in your favour that youre capable of doing well. Remember you dont need to think of everything straight away youre allowed to spend time figuring stuff out. I sometimes forgot that and got worried when things didnt come to me straight away.

I wake up late dont shower when I wake up eat poorly fall behind on studies and get depressed. When friends invite me out I barely want to leave the house.To me it seems that any day that I dont have scheduled out by the hour or where I stay home all day just ruins me.Mind you I beat myself up for not yet being successful.

4333219,0,t3_3ambry,You need to read Learned Optimism by Martin Seligman. Your problem is your thinking habits. Everyone screws up.  When you screw up you tell yourself that youre a lazy worthless scardeycat and youve ruined your whole day.  None of those things is necessarily true. But you say they are and make them so.  Read this book change your thinking and change your life. ,getdisciplined,cse302i,2,t5_2uzju
4340329,0,t3_3aph1x,The key is to change your mindset from being on or off your routine. Your day and life is just a series of moments. Each moment is a chance to make a good choice. Break what you are referring to as your routine into a set of goals or habits you want to encourage. Align each of those to existing triggers. Every time I... do X... I will do Y. Theres obviously a lot more to it but to sum up my core advice it is to not get hung up on on or off your routine. As soon as you fall off a wagon that big you will have a hard time getting up the motivation to get back on. If you break your routine into smaller parts you are not going to have a big fall. You can incrementally encourage positive actions daily. Treat each positive moment as an achievement to be celebrated. Get away from the idea of failure or big massive overnight change. Edit Specifically in regards to your question on wiping out video games completely I dont see that as a good idea. Why? If you enjoy playing video games theres nothing wrong with it. My guess is what you dont like is mindlessly playing games too often or when you want to be doing something else. Work video games in as a reward for other habits you want to encourage. Theres nothing wrong with nonproductive time. The goal to focus on is to spend your recreation time mindfully. Its a decision to relax and do xyz. Youll also find you enjoy that time more when its a mindful decision. ,getdisciplined,csevvq7,4,t5_2uzju

4347419,0,t3_3asw5c,I use this precise link as my goto youtube front page. It only has a feed of my subscriptions which are all set to show me only videos the channels themselves upload and NO related videos. Id use this as the first step to try to reduce exposure to related videos which one should acknowledge as being there for clickbait purposes.    Also after watching any video it might be helpful to try to consciously acknowledge every time you wanna click or actually click a related video. You dont have to force yourself to actually stop clicking on these related videos if you wanna watch them but it is important from the perspective of recognising where youre investing your time to make this conscious effort. You could even stick up a postit on the right edge of your screen to remind you to do this at first.    Then finally it comes down to seeing for yourself and analysing what your actual subscriptions are how much time you invest into watching the videos each of the channels post and for each channel balancing enjoyment vs how much of a waste of time you think it is. You can then gradually unsub from the channels that are most useless to you while keeping the ones you really enjoy seeing videos from. In addition you can start to add in some productive channels that you think you might enjoy but the same logic applies here just coz theyre productive if you dont enjoy the videos too much youre doing yourself a disservice by allowing them to stay on your feed. Your time is the most valuable thing youve got in life after all.    When I started doing the above I had about  subs of mostly gaming channels now Ive got about  of which about a dozen are gamingrelated. Sometimes Ive had to be really ruthless in cutting channels out that Id been subscribed to for a long time but in the end I told myself If Im really missing this particular channel I will remember that it exists in the future and I can always go back and resub and even catch up on its videos if I want to. And a couple of channels did make a return but it was worth it to get rid of a lot of what turned out to be in the end timesucking ones.  Finally Id say the time saved from making the cull has over time transformed into time that I spent rediscovering reading which has been really enjoyable and oh so worth it.

I think that when you recognize those moments where you lack motivation you need to reach down deep within yourself and suck it up and make yourself do the things that you may want to do. Do it. No one is going to do it for you. Study for that test run that extra mile stay away from the distractions.

By exercising our gratitude in appreciation of the world around us and in the inherent difficulty of being alive we are increasingly able to persevere through psychological difficulties.  I say even more important because when things get really tough it often takes an attitude of gratitude in order to get out of bed in the morning and off to the gym.edit In the interests of Full disclosure it was only in the past few years that I came to understand the virtue of gratitude and began to actively cultivate it.,getdisciplined,cta41um,1,t5_2uzju

4727907,0,t1_ctqfo7j,Meditation is a great suggestion. Also try writing in a journal every day for just a few minutes. It really helps you lay out your goals and it doesnt take much work. I used to do this all the time and I found myself in tears some nights as I forced myself to face the hard truths of my life. Its extremely liberating to have your goals on paper. Even if you just write something as simple as I will be happy itll set your brain into the right mindset. And be sure to write dont type it. There really is a more intimate experience when you use a pen and write your reflections on paper. side note Im a very big dude and body powder has been a game changer. I sweat like a Thanksgiving turkey and the powder keeps me feeling fresh. ALSO... be sure to drink plenty of water. Soda makes you feel terrible.

4774853,0,t3_3g7k40,I started learning how to play the bass by playing an intensive  minutes a day every single day. That means after  days I had done  hours. Sounds about right thats probably the time it took me for it to become fun and enticing enough that I wanted more than  minutes. Playing more than that when you completely suck is very discouraging thats why I think its a good method. I think its important to enjoy what you are learning so if I had tried to drudge through hours of practice in the very beginning I would have felt like shit. Theres something about the very first steps on a learning curve that just makes most people want to quit... if only they knew its hard for everybody but not everybody believes they will suck forever.,getdisciplined,ctwevdy,2,t5_2uzju

5179964,0,t3_3lwvxp,I think the very first thing you should do is see a doctor. There could be a medical issue here. I have a relative with OCD who is always late as a result of her condition. I have also heard that chronic lateness could be a symptom of other mental issues maybe it was ADHD but I am not sure.  As someone who is deeply frustrated by people who are chronically late I would not read a blog about your lateness. It would be like reading a blog about a person who loved being selfish and pissing others off. Thats not behavior I would reward with my readership.  Here is my thought on lateness. If I sincerely offered you  to meet me at your closest Starbucks at exactly  a.m. tomorrow what would you do? You would set MULTIPLE alarms. You might enlist a few friends or family members to call you or even physically drag you out of bed. You might set your clocks an hour behind just to make sure you were on time. While most mornings you might sit down with some coffee and surf the web tomorrow morning you would not risk it. You might even leave your house one or even two hours early to make sure you were where you needed to be on time.  If you would not do these things and youd rather sleep in or risk losing a lifechanging amount of money then reddit cant help you at all and you need professional help ASAP.   If you would do these things to ensure you were there on time to receive the money then that means you CAN be on time you just choose not to.  So firstly make a choice to be on time. Secondly stop with the little habits that cause you to be late. If you KNOW you need to leave the house by  to get somewhere by  p.m. then you should NOT be sitting on your computer at  surfing the web working on anything finishing up just this one last thing. Make sure your keys wallet and phone are always in the same place so you dont waste time hunting for them. Have them  ready and in your hand  minutes before you have to leave.  Let your dogs out  minutes BEFORE you leave so youre not on your way out the door saying crap! I need to let them out again!   Instead of waiting until  and scrambling at home looking up directions grabbing a bottle of water searching for your keys checking your email again  one last time and so on do that at  so you can leave by .  I have fired SO MANY people for chronic lateness. I dont care if a person stays late to make up for it. I dont care if there was traffic  I didnt have an ironed shirt  I got to bed late  breakfast took too long  insert excuse here. PLAN FOR IT.  If you have OCD or another medical issue GO TO A DOCTOR  that is  your responsibility. If you dont then develop better habits and a smoother routine.  That means CHANGE. That means stop websurfing ten minutes past the time when you were supposed to leave. That means having your stuff prepared and ready the night before or an hour before so that when its time to leave you leave.  What is stopping you from developing these habits? When you know you have somewhere to be in say two hours what is stopping you from getting your things together looking up the directions programming your GPS sending a final email or two and then getting out the door  minutes ahead of time? ,getdisciplined,cvadizx,8,t5_2uzju

5263822,0,t3_3n2qpo,I took this journey recently.  Well I say took but Im still taking it.  Its a long journey.  In a way its a lot like trying to back off from an obsession with food.  You cant simply stop eating.  So how does it happen?  For me two really important words were Sonder and Namaste.  But those two words and their definitions dont describe a process or even a destination but they more describe a shape.  They describe the shape that Im trying to make my brain take whenever I look at a sentient being.  For the sake of this particular argument theyre the shape Im trying to make my brain take whenever I look at a female human being.So how did I start my journey?  The first thing I did was limit my enjoyment of pornography and attempt to change the stimulus for masturbation.  Ive heard some technical labels applied to that second one but in a way its just associationaversion therapy.  I tried to stop associating the pleasure of an orgasm with the act of viewing pornography and tried to start associating the pleasure of the orgasm with appreciating the character of a person or particular personal accomplishments I walked  miles today!  Well done me heres a reward!.The second thing I did was to limit the frequency of things that give me physical pleasure.  Everything is tied together.  Some things more tenuously than others but physical pleasures are pretty closely tied IMO.  One mantra I had to repeat pretty often is The absence of pleasure is not pain.  I came to the conclusion whether clinically accurate or not that I was addicted and I needed to learn to back off.  That meant that I would have to go through withdrawals.  Oddly enough and be very cautious about this because it could end up being an unhealthy replacement I found that a certain amount of physical pain during my withdrawals gave me perspective.  That what I was feeling despite how my mind equated it with suffering was not indeed pain and that I could tolerate it enough to continue.Other aspects of my life that I have at least partially everything is connected associated with my hopefully former obsessive behavior are  time management priorities how to enjoy life without receiving physical pleasure other sources of physical or behavioral pleasure that may be causing problem sugaralcohol was a huge problem for me persistence and discipline.tldr  treat this like an addiction and find productive ways to change your behavior and thoughts.  ,getdisciplined,cvkifht,7,t5_2uzju

Ended up calling someone and talked it out for a few hours. It hasnt been that bad ever since. Ride out that high dude. Everything feels a little more fresh doesnt it? If your diet isnt great definitely change it. I was on like a  year fast food binge. Ive been eating much less of it over the past couple months and I feel way better about that. One of the hard things of shutting yourself in for so long is that you can forget what youre actually interested in. Rediscover those things!

5346112,0,t1_cvux8mh,Yeah I absolutely enjoy it too.  I always felt like if I was in solitary confinement in prison at least they couldnt take away my dreamland.  Its the one thing I have. But it can be a burden in classes or anywhere you wantneed to pay attention.  For me it has gotten better through the years.  I was prescribed medication as a child which I largely now think was a misdiagnosis.  I was depressed as a child which shares a lot of the same symptoms as inattentive ADHD and its easier to tell parents there is something wrong with their child than it is to say there is something wrong with the way you are parenting your son.  Anyways for me the meditation has helped immensely.  Some people it works for some people it doesnt.  All depends on the person and how you feel about it going in.  Research has been very very strong in favor of mindfulness meditation lowering symptoms of depression and anxiety and improving attention.,getdisciplined,cvv0y4e,2,t5_2uzju

Youve completed  percent of your assigned taskslist for today but stayed up late you did a good job but possibly could go to sleep a little earlier so you can work on going to sleep earlier more slowly than the rest and eventually youll hit equilibrium.

5415906,0,t1_cw3kcwi,I just looked up the book. Its funny that the thought I had in mind from what you said was that I have been building a routine after work. And thats been working for me somewhat. I also track what I do thats not on the routine and evaluate their value and repeat the good ones and not the bad ones. Sometimes it works well and other times I keep getting invited to do social activities which I dont want to turn down. I dont want to be more of a loner than I already am and I like people in small groups. I still try to do my routine but it limits you. Also at work you get endless interruptions meetings and fires to put out. It turns out the book is about building a morning routine. I will read it because Im sure there is more to it. Ive read books on the topic of morning routines already.I have also done the thing that you said where you work on one thing and basically just stop to move your legs to the bathroom get food etc. I got through a pretty hard task by jotting down every negative thing about it or thought about why I should stop until I was done. Filled about  pages with that but I could keep going easily enough.Ive also done that where the thing I focus on is a promise to myself but I still have to fit it around the other things I do. Thinking of it as a promise to myself is something that I thought of after watching the TED talk of the guy who started becauseisaidiwould.com. ,getdisciplined,cw3xvno,1,t5_2uzju

5470058,0,t3_3px5u8,I think we all have been where you are at some point in our lives. For a period of five years I did just enough to get by on my job. I had no desire to move up and had no confidence to move on. Then one day a close friend of mine passed me a book called Failing Foward by John Maxwell.When he put this book in my hand he stared me in the eyes and with passion and conviction told me Youre great and going to do great things.Those words and the wisdom found in this book set me on fire! I havent been the same ever since. There is something powerful in the knowledge that someone believes in you. Another powerful factor is passion. You have to find something you love so much that you want to do your best. That requires the courage to explore. You have to try new things talk to different people and learn something thats not graded. Then one day something will spark your interest and give you that jolt you are in desperate need of. Now dont let me lead you to believe that I dont have moments of laziness but now I know how to prioritize my day and get things done. I actually just wrote an article about it.You should check it out I really think it may help you. Seriously no spam intended Its about making priorities and avoiding distractions to get things done.

5473874,0,t3_3q0xug,Everyone in this thread is missing the point. You dont need to pick more challenges to accomplish because youll end up picking easy shit that you know is easily doable. Because thats what youve been doing your entire life. That wont help anyone and might act as selfvalidation when not much is actually changing. What you need is some perspective on life and the world in general. Do something drastic. Go travel on your own for a month yes Im aware you have a family. Go to a mixed martial arts center ask to spar someone and get the shit kicked out of you. Maybe do this a few times. Go find some psychedelic drugs and take a good dosage of them. OP I bet anything you just read these suggestions and said No way this all seems crazy. And you just proved my point. This issue is not that you dont have challenges this issue is your mindset towards life. You are scared of everything. You are even scared of your inner bitch. Trying to learn trumpet wont change that. You need to get in a situation where you dont have complete control and get your foundation shaken.

5604905,0,t3_3rvr01,My sleep patternstress level was all over the place about a . years ago. I was experiencing the same things you mentioned and I had the same beginning stages you did. I started by getting on a good schedule I went to bed and woke up at the same time I was wishywashy at the beginning but a month into it it got easier and I was much more disciplined. This helped a lot but whenever I had a little bit more stress than usual I would start having small issues waking up early taking a bit longer to fall asleep not sticking with my scheduleAfter I had that down I started working out regularly and this made the biggest difference for me. I had much better results working out in the morning but you can try different things and figure out what works for you. Working out just fixed a lot of things I fall asleep almost as soon as I lay my head down I have much more refreshing sleep and I wake up feeling great in the morning without disruption in the middle of the night my mood is much more positive on average as well.Third I fixed my diet big high proteinlow carb breakfast healthy lunch and light healthy dinner. I also cut down on sugary foods I treat myself to one square of dark chocolate a day but thats it when it comes to sugary food. After implementing all these changes I sleep great I feel great. I stopped needing coffee I stopped experiencing the midday lull.Now Its not all perfect I occasionally have the super stressful day and things can get thrown off but its much rarer than it used to be maybe once every three months or so and it takes a lot more to throw me off. Hope this helps it has made a huge difference for me. It took about a month after implementing a routine before I started seeing significant benefits. Obviously this is just me and you might have to do things differently but I would recommend you try these steps and see if it makes a difference. Start slow and be persistent.

Sending out your work is easier but takes more guts than doing your work in isolation.Id figure out the reason for why youve been procrastinating on that Id attribute it to discipline if you procrastinate in general but since you didnt procrastinate on the portfolio thing i bet there are deeper reasons and find arguments to disprove it then it should be easier to take action.,getdisciplined,cws2cnp,2,t5_2uzju
5627787,0,t3_3s1wid,Hello SirI hope you can appreciate my thoughts about your problems as I can see myself in some of them.When we are young our parents are responsible for us but now you are responsible for your own situation. Everything you impress upon yourself expresses itself eventually in your life. Its no wonder youre depressed if you only sow negativity thats obviously the only thing youll reap.  Change what you think If you want to change your state you have to change what you impress upon your mind what you think about. Being in a habitual state of self criticism doesnt really help so first of all you need to break this habit. You have to keep destructive negative thoughts out of your temple. Having a thought in your head doesnt necessarily mean it is yours and surely you dont have to accept it or even dwell on it. We have the ability to neglect and kick out negative thoughts and can replace them with a positve beneficial one.Your outside life is  a reflection of your inner life. If you have a cluttered mindI dont know if you have chances are very high your room is cluttered as well.  You have destructive thoughts you have destructive behaiviour i.e. smoking. Im  and smoked for  years and went cold turkey almost  months ago. If you project selfhatred the feeling of helplessness and disappointment in yourself your enviornmentalso people will react hating you feeling helpless and dissapointed in you. Please be aware of that.I hope you get what Im trying to say here.Youre only  you dont really know who you are! Please dont be offended I dont know you but I dont really think youre Trans. Call me crazy if you want but from what Ive read it just Sounds you just have to embrace your masculine side more. Work outproven cure for depression and start to take your life in your own hands. Lacking willpower acting slothfully and feeling depressed are honestly just signs for imbalance IMHO. Act or React penetrate or be penetrated.Law of Gender.Nontheless if you still feel that way after getting your life back on track I would still wait a few years before starting such a life changing transition.Go for a   min walk every day and be in nature more often that helps a lot with clearing your mind and thinking about life.No musicTry to take other peoples POV Have you honestly communicated your issues to your parents in a proper and understandable way? I often think I have but thats not always the case.Do you still have free time? Read that Learn this If you want.You may think its BS but it really helped me very much.

5661074,0,t3_3smabp,Try catching yourself goofing off. When you do change your behavior to something that will make you feel more productive. Do not feel bad when you catch yourself. That is a sign of awareness. Your post is a sign of awareness and you are already moving in the right direction.I would recommend mindfulness meditation or just teaching yourself to focus on your body and life as it is right now. It doesnt have to be spiritual but more of a retrainingrewiring of your mind. Your goal at first is to focus on all of the little things you feel in your body. Observe how the air feels going into your noselungs and other things like the air and clothes on your skin. As your thoughts try to distract you tell yourself not to attach and run with them but to let them go as you go back to feeling your breath. Try not to judge yourself or any feelings you have as good or bad but just passing emotions.These techniques have helped me with similar issues greatly in the past few years and I know they will help you as well.

5798146,0,t1_cxfss58,Thank you very much for the reply its very helpful to know that others are pondering the same ideas about life as me and yet they still came to a good conclusion. I do try to question why things are how they are and my part in all of it. I dont study philosophy but I feel it is sort of everyones duty to get why they live and all that so I read about stuff like the free will problem I mentioned before.I feel that over all Im not in a crisis in my life because I am studying enough and am passionate about all my subjects I chose to study. However I could definitely improve my sleeping habits as well as start exercising as a more long term habit because I often get in these weird moods when Im tired and have been up in my head for a long time. Thats when I get all confused and dont even know WHAT I dont know but just feel weird about where my life is. This is when meditation helps as I can just step back and chill the hell out. Maybe the reason I even get to these confused points is because I dont meditate all that consistently and so I get up in my mind a tad bit too much.Also I often question why I even care about all this discipline and selfimprovement stuff as others at my age  dont really seem to think about these things of course this is only based on what I see so it might be that everyone else is like this in some way for all I know. I often think that I could just not worry and go back to playing video games all day or something but I guess Im afraid of wasting time and not developing in life.Im thankful for that at least as it prevents me from sinking too low into laziness and complacency. Maybe all this change of attitude stuff is just part of growing up and also becoming a better version of myself which I really like the idea of but am not always doing it enough.,getdisciplined,cxftcs3,3,t5_2uzju

While the statements youre thinking way to hard about your issues and you just need to do something might be true they betray a lack of understanding of people in OPs shoes. Of course people in deep depression just need to do something. Being depressed is a totally different experience than not wanting to clean your room because youre lazy. For example I got on meds and it gave me the energy to do those things. I still have a shit mindset but medication gave me the will to do basic shit. I also go to therapy and it helps me quite a bit.

6132536,0,t1_cyme2vi,what do you mean by real habit? Going to the gym is great if not one of the best habits... What makes it habit is repetition and its helped immensely by repetition of the exercise at the same time or anchored to something else.I bike to work everyday. Im now at a point a where I dont think about it anymore. Right now its C and snowing but I instinctively dress myself in my biking gear immediately after breakfast without a single thought about whats about to happen next or what the weather or how cold Im about to be. Once youre moving everything is fine.Similarly I have a little note to myself on my phone about my diet and my fitness goals that I read before I go shopping. Its anchored to when I enter the store. Sometimes I reach for my phone when I enter another store with similar doors.

Be friends with everyone and the gender dynamic gets easier plus the girls will like you which in turn only helps your credibility with other people especially other women. The way to succeed is all over this and a few other subs. Make a plan set goals dont worry about falling try every day.

I only really have it at the end of the day if Im going to be asleep when I hit that dip.Eat more protean for that sated feeling and eat lots of veg for the bulk in your belly and the nutrients.Make healthy stuff as convenient as possible. I make my own frozen meals and keep nuts with my for when Im lazy and hungry. Try to avoid sugar swap out fat if you need to.Also and this one is a bit counter intuitive your willpower is connected to glucose. When youre hungry you lose willpower so sometimes its worth having a planed! snack.

6555204,0,t3_45euwz,When I had serious issues with online gaming I went to see a special psychiatrist for addictions in my city. He told me the only way to remove a relationshipas a general term is to realize why its bad for your life and constantly remind yourself of that whenever you think about it. You basically demonize the activity you force yourself to hate it. You swear at it you make it seem lame and harmful in your mind.It might seem like lying to yourself but in fact its the opposite. You are telling yourself the truth that you came upon consciously  you want to get rid of it because it is harmful to your life. But you keep getting back to it  why? Because it gives you immediate gratification. The brain is marvelous but stupid at the same time and sometimes you have to trick yourself to feel the truth.Thats the way he treats serious alcoholics  everytime they think about a drink they literally say out loud something like Beer is disgusting makes you feel like shit I hate it and then do a couple pushups to feel better and stronger. Eventually their paradigm shifts and start to see alcohol in a bad way as default which is contrary to what most former alcoholics do  refuse to drink but still love alcohol.,getdisciplined,czxd0sk,1,t5_2uzju

First I went to a technical college then I studied philosophy and until recently Ive studied cognitive science. However I finished with a degree every time because I didnt want to quit. Now Im  MSc and I have no clue where Ill be in a year from now. What I do know for sure however is that I have zero regrets about any of my decisions because I always did what I wanted to do most when I started and Ive always learned a lot.Currently Im trying to find a way to as you said do something that helps the world or helps change someones world. Im certain that if youre an expert in any field and youre creative about it youll find a way how to apply what youve learned to give something of value to the world. But to become an expert or someone of similar value you have to stick to a field at least long enough to really acquire skills and knowledge. If you still like marine science and you have nothing else youre way more passionate about then fully immerse yourself in it and dont worry about wasting your life.

6637781,0,t1_d05p48i,The router solution is interesting... someone should provide a DNS service that routes YouTube and other time waster sites to empty sites. Then an addict trying to quit can put this DNS server on their router and set a hard password on their router save the password somewhere but make it super inconvenient to get it e.g. print it out on paper and store it at your work or whateverWell.. but its quite easy to circumvent just tell your computer to use Googles DNS server.There was a tool for Linux that would also change your root password so you really couldnt access the settings. Well technically you could reboot to a recovery disk and access the settings file that way. But apparently its just about the inconvenience.

Yes I thought it was plantar fasciitis before but most of the pain is on my heel though I think its not a heel spur either. I feel the pain even if I stand on a bed. The pain comes within just  minute of standing in place. If I stand too much the pain extends all thorught my feet and then feel a pulsing feeling when I finally get to sit down and rest. Its like this basically all the time.Another issue is my buttocks they hurt similarly as my feet when I sit down for just a few seconds. They get alleviated when I lay down flat. Even sitting on my bed hurts.Another symptom is my hip they hurt when I sit down for  minutes or more. They get feel when I flex around and lay down. Finally I have some shoulder pain for the past  years or so.Can I make an appointment with a chiropractor directly or do I have to first speak with my primary doctor? How do I figure out of the Chiropractor spends enough time with its patients?,getdisciplined,d0whg0o,1,t5_2uzju
6892458,0,t3_4a424d,What sort of things do you want to accomplish? Thats the biggest question. I have to agree with one of the other commenters here it definitely sounds like youve got some bad depression. Continuing therapy or medication would likely be helpful. If that isnt exactly the option there are a few suggestions I have for helping you progress out of your situation. Mindfulness mindfulness meditation has been very helpful for me specifically in watching my thoughts and figuring out my thought patterns. When I see bad thoughts arise I can sort of take them apart and get rid of them. Understanding how I think allowed me to start to change how I think which changed how I started to act which changed how I started to feel. This was huge for me.Another thing Id suggest is to really think about what you want to do. Stepping out of your comfort zone is hard but its the only place where you learn about yourself. Think about what you want to be how you want to feel and then figure out how you can become those things. Then you do those things. Its a big task. My journey to very depressed to where I am now took me almost around two years and Im still going because I know I can get better. Start small youre not going to be who you want to be after a weekend. Just keep working at it. Make yourself proud of yourself. To take a quote from Bojack Horseman Every day it gets easier. But you got to do it every day. Thats the hard part. But it does get easier.,getdisciplined,d0xktih,2,t5_2uzju

My point being it sounds like you need a fire lit under your ass and something jarring needs to happen in your world. Thats what helped me get started...now its just momentum and totally external motivation. Im working towards shifting my motivation to be internally based...but for now my exs potential success is keeping me motivated at the moment. Additionally I hacked the shit out of my habits.

Basically the process is Establish belief Understand values and vision Plan goals Be held accountable Track progressWe are thinking of starting with established goals and focusing on the accountability. Every night the user would submit a number of things that they are going to do to progress on a wildly important goal and the following day there is a  minute accountability call to follow up on those items.With regards to becoming a billionaire the first thing I would want to understand is why? What is underlying value that is expressed in that goal? From my experience a goal needs to fit with my values for me to stick with it. Also there may be a faster way to meet the same value.

Is the the current you better than before? No? Go work on yourself. If yes take pride and go work on your self. It shouldnt stop.Okay so youre going to be  this year. Awesome. Usually s are where people have all figured it out. Maybe you will maybe you wont. But dedicate yourself to you. And stop the damn complaining and self pitying. It never fucking works and it will just drag you down. And currently youre at one of your lowest. Good. Go climb your way out. Reconnect with your friends after you start working on yourself. If you want. Tell them about how you discovered youre actually pretty good at this and that and maybe youre going to try your hand at that and maybe even master it. Then ask them about their life. Genuinely support them and feel for them. Then hang up and go work on yourself. Lets see you cant find work. Stop finding work and go network. Whether in real life or online. Whats important is that youre going to be helping them with your skills and theyre going to help you with yours. What skills do you have? You dont have any? Build up some. Try everything and see what youre good at and what you enjoy. You want to do all of that. There is time. Life doesnt have to be in milestones. Whatever that even means anyway you dont have to be at an age to do something.Go out talk to people. Connect with them. Genuinely get interested in them. Let them get interested in you. They might or they might not. Its okay. Rinse and repeat.And one last most important thing. Write down EVERYTHING that you wanna do. Write a plan and stick it on the fridge. Look at it everyday. And work. Stop waiting for motivation to come. That will come later on. Drag your weary self and work on becoming a better you. Work on your person mental health social life intellectuality psychological needs spirituality.Sorry for repeating stuff but Ive never been organized.,getdisciplined,d41nnb7,23,t5_2uzju

7951642,0,t1_d491fac,I have been through some rough times too and I have found that approaching myself with kindness and understanding even when ive been really shitty to myself has been helpful. For example I used to do a similar thing to OP when I was trying to move away from self harm. I would get the urge to self harm and I would shout down that urge by ridiculing it. I even pictured a kind of avatar a version of myself that i often pictured in a bath with slit wrists like an overly dramatic tv suicide which I would chastise as weak and pathetic trying to convince me to hurt myself instead of face up to improving my life. This did seem to help pull me away from self harm on some occasions. But in the long term it was not until I accepted and loved the parts of myself that were destructive and looked at myself with the same kindness and understanding that I would look at a friend with if they expressed my feelings that I was able to avoid the urge to self harm in the first place. Obviously your experience will be different but it might be something to consider. ,getdisciplined,d49u92z,7,t5_2uzju

8131281,0,t3_4qm0yd,Hey welcome to rgetdisciplined!First youre not alone a lot of people have trouble focusing on things for extended periods of time.I would highly suggest you have a discussion with a professional about the possibility of an anxiety or attention related disorder while it is overdiagnosed these days a lot of people do in fact have things like ADD. Get professional help and that alone might solve the problem.No professional help does not necessarily equal pills and drugs a good psychologist may be able to suggest memory tricks or focus methods that give you the little boost you need to push on through. Go try it out and see what you can learn!In the meantime this advice will sound worthless but you just have to force yourself. You normally lose focus after reading a line or two in a book? Consciously force yourself to make it to the end of the page. Thats all one page.See youve made one page. Now push yourself hard for the next one. Thats it just another page you can do it. Now another another keep going until youre done with what you need to do.How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time You will make slow and steady progress just think of it using that imagination of yours like eating an elephant. Youre slowly taking chunks off and eventually youll be where you want to be.Best of luck to you and be sure to come back if you have any concerns or want to update!,getdisciplined,d4u123v,2,t5_2uzju

8224173,0,t3_4rvvf2,Hey budI just graduated in May with my MSC in comp sci.  You can do it but it wont be easy. I was almost in the same boat as you... my thesis submission came down to the last day and it took every ounce of my energy to focus on the work and just get it done. I had to start setting small goals for myself... sometimes as simple as just write one sentence or just read this paragraph. Then take  and come right back. Use your compsci skills and break this problem down into its basic components. As for the academic science writing... its a bitch but it does get easier. I would sometimes just get my ideas down in simple english and then reedit them to sound more intelligent or take out the pasttense and focus on the active only writing style.You need to identify what your trigger for procrastination is.... do you think your ideathesis is crap or not good enough? everyone does or doubts it at some point DONT WORRY! When you become an expert in anything you realize how much there is to consider and calculate when presenting solutions or work google impostor syndrome for more info. I had to break my habitual procrastination by physically leaving the house coffeeshops are awesome places to work and for me the social pressure of having people around forced me to not just play games and reddit but actually work!.  Look up setting S.M.A.R.T. goals  it sounds silly and lame i know... but just making a plan can really be helpful when youre down in a rut.. just stick to the plan man. i.e.  I will graduate in September by committing to coding  hours a day and writing  hours a day. Then.. as time goes by you can measure your performance and adjust accordingly. However you have to be honest with yourself you cant develop sentient AI by Sept. thats the R in SMART realistic!. Above all my friend you have made it this far... come September this will be over  one way or another.

This is a really good idea because its gonna help you be more organised. Instead of thinking fuck today I have to write something for my thesis and I have no idea where to start you could say today I have to find articles for Chapter . Its more precise and its easier to be motivated when you know what you have to write. Break this fat task into a few skinnier ones haha. Just start.

8452708,0,t1_d5w4coz,Hmm so I think that having a high standard for oneself is important in general but I dont think its achieved through discipline. Discipline sounds like the method youve been trying so far and you are finding limited success.Instead of trying to set an artificially high standard and meeting that standard through sheer will  the challenge here is to find the correct standard to adhere to for the project and for you. Well start of by acknowledging that the reward must be worth the effort for you. This is important. Dont let other peoples ideas of what rewards are worth what levels of effort bias you.  This is about you understanding the types of rewards you find valuable. Then you set a baseline. If you could see into the future and knew that this project ultimately had no postive impact on your career or professional  personal growth whats the level of effort you would put into doing it based on the compensation youre getting Remember compensation comes in many forms like quality of life and closeness with coworkersmanagers. Not just  . Thats the standard you should commit to. Not every job is worth putting your soul into. Once again were back to the effort matching the reward. Now factor in the external motivators. What about this project excites you and makes you want to do more than the baseline? This could be anything from personal interest in the subject to Doing this well could mean my next promotion. How much reason do you have to believe these external motivators apply to this situation? Decide what extra effort is worth it if the external motivators did apply and work at that level until you find that they dont. Then go back to the baseline level. Part Three Now you know what rewards best motivate you to be engaged with your projects. Success is a numbers game of  of projects you take on where the rewards are in your top list.If you find that the baseline effort level you come up with is pretty much what youre doing now then the real issue of why you arent motivated is due to you subconciously perceiving yourself as being under compensated. This is a signal that it may be time to ask for greater compensation or move on,getdisciplined,d5y4hqr,1,t5_2uzju
8457102,0,t1_d50xwkf,. I got my scheduling app up to date and always checked this plan before planning my week. I usually checked my weekly plan before planning my day. I used Pomodoros and SelfControl on occasion but not as much as I would have liked. I never slept too late but I didnt exactly get out of bed right at my alarm either. Both of these are things I can improve on next month. But overall I wasted less time this month.  . Ive been learning a lot during clinicals but like last month I didnt meet many of these goals. I havent read any JAAPA I mostly just studied ObGyn at work I didnt take any notes and I didnt use the online PANCE material to the best of my ability. I think I need to be more aware of these goals when planning my weeks and more specific when incorporating these goals into my daily plans. I also struggled to stay present in the last few weeks on my clinical. Im not sure how to improve on this other than being particularly mindful towards the end of my next rotation. Overall I did not learn enough new things this month.  . I maintained my sleep schedule even on weekends. I think there were only two or three days that I stayed up past . I made a lot of soups this month nothing particularly fancy but was nice to cook all my own meals rather than eating out. I did pretty well being confident especially in new situations unfamiliar hospitals. On my rotation evaluation paper my preceptor said I should be more of a presence in the exam room so that is something I should improve on next month. But Im not letting this constructive criticism get me down since Im not dwelling on my mistakes! Despite the weather I got outside a walked quite a bit this month. Overall I was my own best friend.  ,getdisciplined,d5yo82a,2,t5_2uzju

8464644,0,t3_4vk8c2,I too sometimes have the nihlistic conflicts with myself. I for a long time felt there was no point to anything so why bother.However these days I find myself trying to recreate the awesome experiences that helped shape me experiences that I think made me a better human being.Now Im a game developer the experiences I talk about are things like Warcraft s awesome campagin or the experience of winning a DotA match with my friends. I want to and have created experiences for other humans that bring smiles to their lips and gets them thinking its awesome to help society even in a tiny way.I like to view society as one big living mass and our actions can help push it even a tiny bit in a better direction.Thus the evolutionary need to procreate to pass genes isnt the only important thing.Einstein gave more to society with his mind than his genes.Seek to better humanity in every way with every tiny action.Asking someone not to litter is a tiny task but a task that can help shape to world into something better.Now you might ask what it better you get to define that yourself based on whatever morals and ethical codes you follow.Can certainly be tricky if you think everything is pointless however I am fairly confident you have an opinion on moral matters even if conditioned by society.I disagree with people who say Dont overthink it Fuck that you have a powerful brain. Sit and read some philosophy and always think about your place in the world the universe and all existence. However at the end of the day we do need to eat and sleep we do need to be happy and by slowly sifting through your minds thoughts about why you exist you should drive yourself closer to happiness.Hope my random thoughts on the matter gives you a different perspective to consider it all from.

8512618,0,t3_4wb4h6,Hey welcome to rgetdisciplined!Generally speaking if youre just generally unhappy with your life without anything specific to target I can only offer four big things you should focus on before that would you mind answering my question quick?What are you exactly unhappy with?Could be your weight general health fitness grades dating dressing style living situation whatever what do you want to change about yourself?Alright now that youre hopefully thinking about that heres the four big things that I already discussed with another individual here on Reddit. This is a version of that.So you want to change yourself but you dont know how?Thats okay. Really its okay! Youre smart enough to ask questions which puts you above a lot of people. Heres what I want you to focus on in a broad sense. Take care of yourself physically.A vast vast majority of people who come here and are unhappy with their lives are not in the best shape physically being under or overweight isnt healthy. This is also one of the easiest things to control for . of people get yourself in shape.Dont know where to start? Use this BMI chart BMI is not the beallendall of good physical health and fitness but its a hell of a lot better than nothing.Getting yourself into a good place physically can do absolute wonders for you in terms of mental and physical healthFor most people I speak to this often times solves their problem right out of the gate being in bad physical health messes with your brain and makes you do less than optimal choices. Take care of yourself mentally.So youve gotten yourself in good shape youre now within a healthy BMI range and you still dont feel that great.Thats okay! There might be a mental component you need some help with. There is no shame in getting help.THERE IS NO SHAME IN GETTING HELP.Determine exactly what youre feeling. Do you feel saddownapathetic all the time? Do you suffer mood swings? What happens when you try to do stuff you should do like work out or study? Once youve determined that go talk to someone. If youre in a schooluniversitycollege setting your school almost certainly has a free or reduced cost service available to you. Use it! Youre paying for it! Even if youve graduated college you still may be able to get reduced cost from your college as an alumni.If that doesnt apply to you in any way then start looking at private mental health care or public clinics if you live in a country with them. A lot of the time with mental health many people need someone to vent to and bounce ideas off going to a psychologist isnt saying give me happy pills. Often times theyll work with you to find a plan that helps your specific needs in my case losing weight was  of my mental issues and the other  came from lack of social grace. Maybe all you need is to get out and socialize more! Get a job or a hobby.I cannot stress the benefits of this enough. Get a job or a hobby preferably ones that make you money and make you happy. This means dont pick up something like Magic The Gather or tabletop gaming. While both can be pretty social events they likely are a step in the wrong direction in terms of social grace and notspendingmoney. Need some ideas? Drawing. Dancing. Pick up an instrument for cheap at a garage sale. Go learn to lift weights and get jacked. Go to a local park and develop gymnastic ability. Learn to animate D or D. Write stories learn to build shit for the house tables wine racks whatever. Learn to repair your home if you own a house. Theres countless ideas out there! Do not worry about dating.Seriously dont worry about trying to date. Based on your writing style Im assuming youre a guy. Unless youre currently in a relationship which you may or may not no idea dont even bother trying to date.Good dating is asking what do you bring to a relationship to draw people in. So you see a cute girl walk up and chat end up wanting to date.No one wants to date the mopey lazy person nor do they want to be with someone who has no future plans ideas or ambition generally speaking not to mention someone with no interesting hobbies.Work on the three things above theyll not only help with your laziness but make you a better happier person!,getdisciplined,d65mv7b,3,t5_2uzju

8571397,0,t1_d6bn1yf,I get your issue. Theres no problem in actually doing these for  hours but for most people its not practical. For me the biggest change came from forcing the habit. For example today I woke up  minutes before a class. However I did the ritual in  minutes devoting  minute to each. Now I wouldnt recommend doing this everyday but it builds momentum. I am now on day  or something like that of consecutively doing this ritual everyday. Its become such a part of my life now that if I dont do this Ill feel uncomfortable for the rest of the day. About affirmations yeah youre right. It does feel like lying at first. But thats alright. Just do it for the sake of it. Experiment doing it for atleast a month. Heres one I use I completely accept my body for what it is and yet I strive to improve it. By repeating this affirmation everyday I am now way less self conscious about how I look. I also have an affirmation about taking care of my body and exercising so I do that as well. I know that those visualizations dont seem realistic but theyre what motivate me. Heres how I do it. I visualize the end goal for me in  things Health Wealth Love and Happiness. So I do visualize myself with a super athletic body with a beautiful girl in a great house. Its not realistic to me either. So what I do is I also visualize the process that will get me there. For health I visualize myself exercising everyday. For love I see myself talking to girls that I like and trying to build a connection. I hope this gives you some ideas. Feel free to ask more.

8632051,0,t3_4y36c7,Serious answer here if there is little to nothing in your life that actually makes you feel happy see a mental health professional or your doctor because it sounds like you have the textbook symptoms of clinical depression loss of enjoyment of things you feel you should enjoy feelings of dread and hopelessness selfhate and being overly selfcritical. Thats not borderline depressive and feeling like that for a long period of time is not normal  thats depression. I think you need to get some professional help because as a random person on the internet I cant diagnose you which means I dont know the best way to help you.If youre not sure how youre feeling exactly you can try keeping a mood diary every day rate how you felt overall on a scale .  is feeling like literal shit  is neither good nor bad  is one of the happiest days of your life. You can optionally list out the good or bad things that happened that day. If you see a LOT of lt days in a row thats very telling of your condition. Finally I will also say that it is possible that your job is causing you to feel this way. If you were still enjoying your free time weekends and personal life I would say that that is your only problem. But it sounds like youre unhappy with life in general even during your free time.If nothing else know this you deserve to be happy. Even if you werent as hardworking and disciplined as you actually are you would still deserve to be happy. But theres an obstacle in the way and you need to find out what that is the best way to do that is to check up on your mental health. ,getdisciplined,d6km2nt,4,t5_2uzju

There is something like a beginners grace period where you feel that desire for  months then after that you lose a lot of motivationenergy to continue. This is where discipline kicks in where reading your goals and sticking to them regardless of how you feel really plays a pivotal role in getting yourself over that  month hump where you feel less energy. After that its pure habit that will help you move forward.

8879259,0,t1_d7etol6,Happy to help! Glad it helped you out some.To answer your questions.For the record I do make games and D animations for living I am mostly an artmodelsmanagement guy but until recently worked entirely alone doing both art and C programming. Please bear that in mind when I discuss some specific ideas I have for your learning. If they dont apply as well as I suggest its a lack of knowledge on my part so adjust accordingly. This is one of the harder things since to each person good studying comes differently especially regarding topics they may or may not possess an inherent talent at. What works as a study method for you may not work for me and vice versa.Generally speaking if you can at the end of your work period sit back and remember a good chunk  of what you just did well enough to briefly discuss it with someone educated on that topic youve learned well.In terms of measuring your effectiveness its a lot of how much review and going back you do. For myself learning C was a horridly inefficient process since Im selftaught so there was a ton of going back copypaste rewatching and redoing work that already existed.If you can studylearn for  hours and then tomorrow pick back up with a brief review youre doing awesome. If it takes a little bit of review and relearning thats OK too!You do have to consciously check yourself however. If youre reading or practicing and then have that realization of oh my god I dont remember the last page I just read its time to take a break. Keep an eye on yourself mentally and take plenty of breaks as needed. This one is very easy to answer actually!Screw it if your goals are lofty. Know what you can do with super high level goals?Break them down.The proverb how do you eat an elephant? small bites comes to mind. Take your super high level goal Learn C for example and break it down. What exactly does it take to really know how to program in C? Learn basic commands Learn the API for a game engine youre working in Review and read through the documentation learn how the code interacts with itself Does it allow Methods? Is it object oriented? What do I need to enable when doing different codes?Quick example In Unity  you have to enable UnityEngine.UI to get Text objects on screen. Learning that and learning exactly what UnityEngine.UI enabling gets you would be a lowlevel goal.In terms of handling not reaching your goals thats a little more complex for you because its all about how do you deal with changes to schedulesnot reaching it.Odds are youre not going to learn an entire programming language or punch out a whole precalc course in two weeks. The best mathematicians Ive ever met couldnt do that and they work at Graduatelevel math because theyre insane.Thats totally fine!Learning is about the journey not the destination. If you leave these two weeks with a really solid foundation in a variety of subjects that you wanted to study youre doing really well.Then when you head back to college be sure to continue your learning!Hopefully I answered your questions let me know if theres anything else I can clarify or do.Good luck!,getdisciplined,d7f5ucy,1,t5_2uzju

The bottom shot is my RescueTime log of the past month Ive been using Squad.To build Squad I used Swift clientside and Go serverside. I didnt use Xamarin or another crossplatform tool because Ive written several iOS apps and can iterate faster with Swift. As to how long its took to build this I started playing with different productivity mechanics a few months ago and this is the third major iteration. Previously I experimented with recording my screen and keystrokes then creating a work montage from the moments where I had bursts of keystrokes. Another experiment was integrating with GitHub code commits so your profile would show your latest commit and commit message and the most recent committer was at the top of the friend list. Next iteration will include a task list and help around what I call flinches when you hit a rough point in your work and reflexively start typing redd into your search bar. Thatll be ready in a week and a half.Thanks for the support!,getdisciplined,d7g9aj0,1,t5_2uzju

While plenty of licensed therapists work with people who are not mentally ill and just want to improve personal skills therapists are licensed to diagnose and treat mental illness.Coaching is for people who are well but want directive advice or input. Its like the difference between going to a physical therapist vs. going to a personal trainer. The former is to help you recover from injury or trauma. The latter is to take you from relative health to better physical fitness. There is overlap but if your goal was to develop a fitness routine you wouldnt necessarily need a licensed PT  a trainer with a solid background would probably be a better fit.Edit Im on mobile amp have middleaged eyes with fogged up contacts.

9006426,0,t3_53kqbt,From what you wrote its clearly a problem of mindset to me. You know the methods to lose weight  eat less calories than you eat now and exercise more  and the methods to be financially more stable  save more money and dont waste it in useless items like you wrote. But not being able to complete these steps means your issue is not about methodology its about mindset. The issue isnt how do I lose weight? its I dont have the motivationdiscipline to go to the gym.So how do you solve this issue? By changing your way of thinking obviously. If the issue is in the mindset thats where you have to begin. Your way of thinking which Ill call mindset from now on dictates the outcomes in your life. Unfortunately many people misunderstand this entirely. They assume that by wishing for something to happen and by having positive thoughts eventually the outcome will be great. So just think positive thats what you hear many people say. But thats not how it happens. Your mindset gives you the description of things around you. This description becomes the way you see the world. See the world doesnt have intrinsic characteristics it has the characteristics that you project into it. In other words you see the world as you choose to see it not like it really is. So the way of solving your problems is by seeing your world in a different way. Or by looking at things and seeing something different. So whenever you think about gym you think tiring exhausting timeconsuming... What if you associated gym with lifechanging? What if you think about gym and imagine yourself in a few years all ripped with  body fat and lots of muscles? These arent some things I just made up going to the gym is how you get those things. So replace the bad thoughts with better ones. Going to the gym isnt bad its how you change your life. Its how you get fit its how you increase your selfesteem. See yourself with less than  of body fat and lots of muscles. How does it feel? Really close your eyes and imagine yourself with the body of Thor or Captain america. How does going to the gym feel now? Tiring and exhausting or lifechanging? The same can be applied to your finances. Buying useless items is cool when you feel the instant gratification but in the long term its not. So imagine yourself in the long term with a million dollars in the bank and being able to be free not stressed because of money etc... By imagining this youll look at this mindless consumption and think how stupid was I? Its all about the mindset man. ,getdisciplined,d7ufjok,2,t5_2uzju

9031846,0,t1_d7x8we4,Thanks for the reply.  Sometimes it genuinely is fear  youre right.  I think this was the difference for me between university and work  I did physics at university and completing a task was a lot more black and white than when I started working in consulting.  I found myself taking way too long on simple tasks purely because there was infinite room for improvement compared to university assignments.Some other odd examples of this dont agree with this view.  For example I look at my past and what I want to do now careerwise and I feel like the path I have taken is not optimum for the career  that I could have been doing other things.  This isnt about fear  its about looking back and irrationally wishing I had a linear route straight into what I want to do now even though I hadnt even heard of the field back then.,getdisciplined,d7xhgve,2,t5_2uzju

I did all the huge things I wanted. The only massive longterm goal I have now is the way I want to look in the years to come but Ill never get to my fitness goals at this rate if I dont set some small ones along the way.My long term goals were aplenty enough that it kept me focused. I never thought about what would happen when I achieved them though. I thought I could just chill and everything would be easy to ride through because everything has to be easier once I already did all the hard things. Turns out Im just so bored I cant even do the things to prevent boredom.Whether or not I take up bullet journalling I think the principle still applies.

Ill never forget what one of my music professors once said In high school your passion is a hobby. You do it for fun. In college its what you study. You pick it apart and analyze it. Then it becomes your job. Its what you do every single day. Your ability to pay the bills depends on it. You cant get away from it because its now your job AND your hobby. And for many people thats when they realize that maybe it should have stayed a hobby in order for it to still bring you joy. Some people just arent wired to have their passion be their job.That always stuck with me because I think deep down I knew that was me.

9420782,0,t3_59c1he,I think that there are two things he is saying.. Happiness is possible despite your circumstances. You can still be happy even if you came from x y or z situation. Sometimes getting out of our comfort zone means getting away from these people or places and making different choices.. In order for you to find this happiness you must stop looking for outside reasons to be unhappy  they will always be there. Instead find out for yourself what makes you happy. By doing that action you either eliminate that possibility or allow that to grow. Say you call that girl  you may hit it off or not so much...Even though her rejecting you would make you unhappy the prospect of never calling her and wondering what would have been would make you unhappy for much longer. This action in itself creates a new choice for you and you can move forward in whatever way you choose  creating more possibilities. I dont think its a matter of discipline in this case more so a matter of getting out of your comfort zone as the author was saying.Being disciplined plays a part. To me it means that I am going to be accountable to myself and others. If you start to be accountable for your own happiness and growth in life you might make better choices that will benefit you long term. I do struggle with doing this myself so Im not saying its easy! The more you practice at something the easier and more natural it will come to you. Its okay to try something and say Well thats not for me. ,getdisciplined,d9a5dln,1,t5_2uzju

It wasnt directly about my discipline or routine it was something much more specific diet.Diet in fitness is very important. Changing your body is nearly impossible if you dont fix your diet first. Seriously you can lift all you want but if you dont give your body the proper fuel it wont grow. After struggling with my diet Ive finally got it down properly and my gainz are going really well. So my advice to you is to study up on your goal is it getting bigger? Losing weight? Choose a routine fit for that I use a pushpulllegs program for gaining muscle. Next up is getting knowledge on food and diet. How does the body work? What do you need to fuel it with? Lastly get back at it. This time with a proper diet. Youll make noticable change within two months. I did. I drink beer in the weekend. I know I can because I compensate accordingly throughout the week. Good luck!,getdisciplined,d9j0mde,2,t5_2uzju

9582111,0,t3_5c6zjo,Two things that worked for me  Have a pint of water next to your bed down it as soon as you wake up.  This is good for you for a bunch of reasons it also forces you to get up shortly afterwards.  Use an interval timer on your phone.  Plan what your ideal morning routine would be and plug it into the interval timer one with text to voice like Seconds Pro.  Plug everything in e.g.  Get up  min  Go to bathroom  mins Make cup of coffee  mins Write in journal  mins Meditate hr As soon as you get up promise yourself you will just start the timer and turn the volume up. This is a very small step and reasonably easy to achieve you dont HAVE to do anything more than just that.  But it will yell what you should be doing outloud. You dont have to think about what you are doing you dont have to summon up willpower you can ignore it if you want to but you might find it is easier to just surrender to the timer and do what it is telling you to do.  Then an hour later you find that you have had a productive morning without having had to put much effort in at all. ,getdisciplined,d9u6vph,27,t5_2uzju

9969512,0,t3_5i82rv,Your question is quite relevant and valid.Sometimes in the process of becoming disciplined you get stuck in a particular situation. Lets say that you find that you dont mind working out at the gym once that youre at it but you find it very hard to go from doing nothing to starting your exercises. Lets say that you have tried other methods and that they havent worked to pull you to the gym without a heavy internal struggle.So yes its fine to go as far as you can without an artificial reward artificial as in one that is not provided by the behavior itself nor as a result of the behavior but in cases like this you just want to try something that works.The thing is that you have to be careful lest your behavior ends being strongly conditioned to the reward.One solution could be to use some tokens with the condition that you have to accumulate a preestablished amount of tokens in order to receive your reward. This way you dont receive the reward every time.Another solution could be to turn your behavior reinforcement into a jackpot machine. Every time you arrive at the gym throw a pair of dices just once of course. Reward yourself only when you get a twelve. Again this way you can avoid getting your behavior too attached to the reward.What you want is to find the right balance so that you can use as little artificial reinforcement as possible.When it does work keep it for ten days or so and then make the rewards a little more expensive. If you needed  tokens for your reward change it to . If your playing the jackpot machine game put  yellow beads in an opaque bag and  red bead and reward yourself only when the red one is the one that you picked without peeking.The objective is to space out the actual rewards more and more until your behavior becomes independent from them.This is one way of becoming disciplined. It is not the only way.,getdisciplined,db71ycz,1,t5_2uzju

10367389,0,t3_5ocyjf,Yo bro Ive been fat and fit before.  I never experienced being ridiculed in the gym once in  years... for anything.  It will feel uncomfortable walking in there at first.  But believe me even if it doesnt feel like it gymgoers are a bunch of folks that are more than likely silently cheering you on for being in there.  Which is kind of funny because as a fat person it was where I at first felt the most uncomfortable.Outside of the gym is another story completely and people just treat you way worse for being fat.  I dont know why people harbor so much irrational animosity towards fat people.  It is honestly crazy.  They are more hated than say a person that is known to drink and drive regularly.  Yet the fat person is really only hurting themselves.  Lots of people are just irrational and shitty in the world.  Realizing that should give you some comfort.The other thing I feel like mentioning is that losing fat will almost entirely come from your dietary choices.  Exercise has a lot of positive benefits but fat loss is not one of the primary ones unless youre willing to do cardio several hours per week... and even then it wont do too much if you dont control your diet.  So if losing fat is your goal I would strongly urge you to closely track your calorie intake and long term weight trends.  There are a ton of supposed great systems for this but at the end of the day it is just about calories and having the self control to significantly limit them.Finally one huge warning sign from your post is I should continue to treat my body badly because someone was an asshole.  Passing off self responsibility in the face of adversity is an extremely self destructive trait  one that way too many people have.  Dont do that.  Take responsibility for your own actions rather than blaming others.,getdisciplined,dcj7f3b,2,t5_2uzju
10372034,0,t3_5oer5g,Ive been a student of several foreign languages and one of the most effective techniques Ive used is singing. My high school Spanish teacher had us sing slow pop songs in Spanish every week. It slows you down so youre not rushing through your words giving you time to concentrate on pronunciation and it frees your attention up from what youre going to say. All you need to think about is how to say it. Also the act of singing focuses your attention on imitating the sound. It was the most helpful pronunciation exercise Ive ever done in many years of learning several languages from many teachers.

10610519,0,t3_5rqlsj,I had to drop my classes this semester for the spring. It was the hardest thing Ive ever done  admitting I wasnt able to do it. Ive been struggling with my choice. I broke down in the advisors office when I made the appointment the week before classes started. Family and job situation changed and I wasnt able to afford the tuition or set up a student loan. I did not have the time or money to go to school.  I was struggling with my degree as well. To top it off my mom was one of the first women in her family to go to college.  She didnt ever really say it but I felt she was proud of me when I was attending. Telling her I had dropped out was the worst feeling in the world. Im going to change my degree to something I am passionate and dedicated to in the fall.  Im still job hunting and planning on applying for fall scholarships but this post made me feel better. I have hope. It helps to know struggle isnt just experienced by one.  Thank you. ,getdisciplined,ddae72v,3,t5_2uzju

10665596,0,t1_ddfziso,I used to do the billing for a health care company as a finance guy. This involved coming in and running some extensive reports tying them out and billing. Takes about  hours total done weekly.Many weeks I had issues balancing. Then sometimes billing. One day when I woke up to do it I reviewedvisualized the day going  perfect. Oddly enough it did. Tried next week same deal. Then I started using it for other things.Its not magic but when you visualize achieving something or things working out your mind will work to move you in that direction.Think about it like driving  if you focus on a point your car will just naturally move that way without you thinking. Say youre sliding in snow and theres a telephone pole. If you focus your attention on it youll tend to hit it.

10747965,0,t3_5tim7q,I think you are looking at this the wrong way. Instead of thinking How can I force myself to like things that are hard? think How can I make things easier for myself?Running is a very good example of this. You can absolutely design a running program that makes running  or  miles easy. Itll start with running just one minute and increasing the time as you get more comfortable exerting yourself. Each run starts with only the requirement that you put your running shoes on. What people lack isnt as much the ability to push themselves but the patience to let the results come to them. They want things to happen quickly and power their way through frustrating themselves along the way. Working smart instead of hard and looking for ways to make things simpler and easier is a skill that needs practice just like any other but it allows you to achieve things you might not otherwise achieve. ,getdisciplined,ddokjuk,2,t5_2uzju

I think that you are just becoming aware of the problem and you try to quit. But it is a little bit more difficult than you might think. It can be solved and about your permanent brain damage look it is true than for example you where addicted to porn and you quit those neutal pathways are still there and will be easier actived then when you watch it for the first time. These neural pathways become weaket and weaker that is how you get rid of addictionby stop doing it. Your brain adjuts to this and all is fine. But what also can cause trouble is that you have a deficieny in building blocks of neurotransmitters because your brain used it all up because of all the overstimulation and your diet is lacking the proteins to reple ish this. It might. Check out julia ross and proteins. Watch out if you take medication for this but you should look into this. Talk to your doctor about this. Consider protein powder. Check out nosuf check out nofap i can higly recommend that there are more guys like you.Good luck ,getdisciplined,dej9qnd,1,t5_2uzju

Dont be afraid of failure or making mistakes just try to learn from them. And Ive found the best way to fight it is to register any negative thoughts as they happen and INSTANTLY try to snap out of it. Focus on the task at hand think happy thoughts and try to map out a timeline of goals to become better at what you do. Realize that it is a journey and your experience is growing more valuable by the day. Easier said then done but try to forgive yourself and also dont ever denigrate your own work to your superiors.

11545329,0,t1_dg4ksjm,Ooh I feel that. Its really difficult to do anything when it feels like nothing matters. Speaking personally I also have a really hard time feeling like stuff matters whether its school work whatever.It absolutely makes sense for you to feel like hedonism is the only thing that matters. In fact even though they dont say it out loud Id honestly bet that most people agree with you. Nobody is ever going to enjoy a thing they have to do as much as they enjoy doing what they want to do. Thats why I can focus on video games for hours but need a break half an hour into a study session.I think getting other people involved is a really good call its a lot easier to stay motivated when youve got people with you which is why I can do like three times as many crunches in a fitness class as I can alone at home. Your boss sounds great and Id maybe talk to them about what keeps them going.I think coming to terms with doing stuff you dont want to do is like  of being a responsible person. Its hard though. I find that practicing gratefulness helps a lot this job might not be inspiring but at least I get to go home afterwards and do what I want with the money Ive earned which is more than a kid of people get and mindfulness is awesome but theres a lot of trial and error in figuring out what works for you. ,getdisciplined,dg4nyd1,1,t5_2uzju

A good week! My last few weekly reviews have been pretty disappointing but nothing gets me out of an unproductive funk like high stress levels and this week was very stressful. Two minor due dates this weekend two major ones and a highstakes test the following Monday that if failed would threaten my upcoming graduation. But I handled them all with planning. I got the minor stuff out of the way early on and worked a little bit on each bigger project broken down into specific goals every day. I even found time to apply for a job cook a meal and keep in touch with friends. I did well in keeping my mindfulness goal as well as limiting my internet surfing. The only thing that suffered this week was my bedtime. I stayed up past midnight most days which I havent done since undergrad. While it did help with getting stuff done the stuff is now done so I can spend then next week trying to get back to a regular sleep schedule.  ,getdisciplined,dgo3cnb,2,t5_2uzju

11799523,0,t3_68bdx6,The thing that strikes me most about your post other than that I can totally relate is that you say growing up you were told by everyone around you how smart you were. There is solid research that shows how damaging this can be in the long run in terms of messing with your psychology. It is possible you are grappling with some of the outcome from constantly being told you were smart rather than having been told for example how great you were at sticking with a project and seeing it through to the end or being praised for effort rather than an innate intelligence that you may not believe you actually have.  It could be a confidence thing you are struggling with now. Some therapy or maybe a good self help book or two might get you over this road block. I was just reading about some of the best books over at rpsychology becauseas I said I can relate!  Good luck to you. ,getdisciplined,dgxilxi,18,t5_2uzju
11805342,0,t3_68fvng,im relating too hard to your middle paragraph. its horrifying im horrified. cant help with advice because im basically you  except im doing the scary studies thing amp i am terrified. have a safety net. a safety net is good because being able to fall back is better than trying and having anything confirmed. that can help ease the anxiety. that way youre mostly just challenging yourself not feeling like itd stop you from a job if you already have marketable skills in something. ,getdisciplined,dgy6cvz,2,t5_2uzju
