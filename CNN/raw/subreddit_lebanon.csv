And once divorced the woman gets half. Furthermore the woman gets the house. So your friends mother could have divorced her husband and gotten his house if she wanted to. The process is a bit lengthy but it is valid and no different than when a woman divorces her husband in islam although not as easy as when a man divorces his wife in islam.So yes i put down islamic religious laws because it is indeed not equal to women as are many of the practices of islam. ,lebanon,clqoz4e,1,t5_2qzpg

4602608,0,t3_3dygmk,Both my parents and their families lived through the civil war and my father was an adult at the time he is  years old today. Since we have talked a lot about it at home I can help with your questions a bit. However it should be taken into consideration that all these answers are from a very devout but not fanatic Maronite Catholic point of view. I also apologize in advance for the English mistakes. The following answers can be considered my dads . It definitely broke the little bit of trust between the religious sects in sight of building a better nation at least in our parents generation. In the Christian camp I think its inaccurate and exaggerated to say that the war left a feeling of islamophobia. However a lot of older Christians think that a lot of Lebanese Sunnis sympathize with ISIS and would side with anyone against Christian presence in the nation. Of course this sensation is geared towards Sunnis much more than Shias since in the end Sunnis were the ones to side with Palestinians against their nation.. My dad says he risked his life multiple times to go get food for the family. He also says that a friend of him once asked them if he wanted to hide with him in his shop. My dad refused and a few hours later a war projectile fell inside killing his friend.. My dad says he did not.. It is mostly rebuilt structurally however its safe to say that it is still socially fragmented with areas belonging to a religious sect or another. Also Palestinian refugee camps are still in an awful condition.. Yes but with a SunniShia conflict more probably than a ChristianMuslim one.   ,lebanon,ctaqvg3,1,t5_2qzpg

An equivalent to a French saying hes not European is me saying Im not middle eastern.Agreed. I didnt have the time to hone my examples. Regardless Arab corresponds to a specific definitiongt Arabs rbz Arabic  arab are a major panethnic group whose native language is Arabic comprising the majority of the Arab world.Definition of Arab World gtThe Arab world Arabic   allam alarab formally   alwaan alarab also known as the Arab nation   alummah alarabah consists of the  Arabicspeaking countries of the Arab League.Thats what Arab is if you want to stick to a formal definition. If you dont you are outside of the boundaries of commonly agreed definition and as a result forming a personal opinion about yourself. Again you dont get to define what Arab means no more than you can define what table means.  You can however discuss the semantics of Arab just like you can discuss the semantics of table and attempt to change its meaning. You are allowed to say a table should always have four legs and a three legged table should be called something else. But it is a new definition you will have to convince people of not something you can from the get go use as you please.gt Nope not really. The Arab identity from the Gulf to North Africa makes no sense the peoples in those countries are so different we are not one peoplegt It does we are NOT the same people.No group of people large enough is one people. Even in Iraq there arent one people. Egypt has coptics and a bunch of other ethnies. Lebanese are definitely not as we all know one people. That we have different habits and ethics has nothing to do with our geographical affiliation.gt Well I am saying it D and Im not alone in doing so.Sure. And I can say Im a slice of ham. Being able to say it doesnt magically imbue the statement with sense.gt Here were and still is plenty of nationalist movements in the area that claim were not Arabs. Arab nationalism did succeed with Baathists and Nasserists taking over much of the MENA region but dont think its written in stone and have never been challengedSure. As a movement to not be part of the Arab League why not. As a movement to redefine a definition it is moot. I havent followed the link youve posted though as I have no time right now.

When I make my order from Lebanon Ill input Borderlinxs address and my suite number as if thats my real address in the US and the package will ship there. When the package arrives at Borderlinx because it has my suite number on it Borderlinx will know who the package is for and will notify me on my account that I created on their website and prompt me to release it.

Through that link and without  a lot of details   armed men accompanied my grandmother  mom and aunts to a building to identify thier belongings. All was returned except  for a few invaluable stuff. One pregnant lady at one of the flats started  taking  her dress off to hand back until  she was told to consider it a gift.It was interesting for my grandparents. My grandpa was a known ssnp member from Zgharta and living  in Tripoli. Good  thing that trouble in koura  zgharta and tripoli was staggered so they always had somewhere  to go.....Another  funny  story  the old man was well known and liked in zgharta despite  his ssnp background. When marada and ssnp had thier fallout  he was called frequently  for mediations and such. The one time  a lady called him to ask for her sons  release since although  he was imprisoned  during a clash  he still didnt  get to shoot his rifle and therefore  hes  innocent.

It still cost less than buying them locally to be honest. They enforce payment by holding the product at customs either the shipping company clears it or the recipient gets called in to clear it.However if you ship with libanpost their shipments are exempt of customs. like aliexpress. Though this option is not commonly available internationally it does exist sometimes.,lebanon,dbf2qqe,4,t5_2qzpg

But tell you one thing  and thats just a personal advice or opinion if you had brought up the take a chill pill statement in an actual conversation where i perceive I am doing you an indirect favor by taking the time and writing some awareness factors of the current situation in a country you and many like you are living in even though I am far and away from it and that i think would be beneficial to any smart person who wants to pay attention from experience of another regardless if he or she perceives t as right or wrong. May seem from your end towards the person writing the info as for the lack of a better term condescending. And while i dont pry on other peoples affairs in forums I have read a recent post of yours where you do express your feelings that you are looking for that inner light that you feel lost in this world and man i dont blame you and i can totally relate  most of us go through it but trust me you would be doing yourself a big disservice if you ditch other peoples arguments on a subject matter entirely unrelated to your feelings but on the contrary one which may help you maybe just a bit in the future when perhaps dealing with face value information of this kind. I feel you are a nice guy and im not trying to put you down just saying it and hope you understand if you dont have something meaningful to say sometimes its best not to say anything at all rather than get yourself tangled in a conversation where the end factor is almost always not going to be in your favor.

I cant speak for the other countries of the Middle East or the other countries on the list from the original post.ampnbspgt I dont see the circlejerk youre talking about.

Faith in reddit restored!That being said while you understood what OP was trying to say a lot of the replies in the original post are confused because OP wasnt particularly clear with the intention or wording of his post. However what ticked me off was that even though a lot of the replies were confused none of them questioned the barbarity and antiSemitism of the countries that had an Israel ban one of which is Lebanon.Thats why I posted my reply.

10666509,0,t3_5shl0f,I am also a first generation Lebanese American.Heres my reconciliation between both worlds.My thoughts on Lebanon  I support all Lebanese in an effort to better themselves and the country I do not approve of infighting and support Lebanon to be successful the people must work together and help each other. Divide and Conquer is a strategy to damage an enemy and honestly I believe that was done to Lebanon intentionally and outside forces want Lebanon divided to keep it weak.  I support Lebanese overcoming this bullshit to work together and ultimately realize that it is the Land and heritage that binds us together.  Our national symbol is a tree entwined with divinity and just like that tree it has many branches and so too Lebanon has many branches of faith but we all are from the same tree.  One tree One God many interpretations but ultimately one Lebanon.  There are those outside who want a divided Lebanon because I honestly believe they fear a united Lebanon.  A united Lebanon is the last thing they want but they wont stop it from happening.My thoughts on the U.S.  I want the us to quit the bullshit in the Middle East and ditch Israel which does absolutely nothing for the U.S.  I have yet to ever receive my friends of Israel check and yet billions of tax dollars a portion of mine included go to funding their stupid civil rightsinternational law violations.Im pro America but very much anti interventionist anti israel nanny state.  I dont think the us should be a nanny state for anyone including Lebanon.I believe the US should just sit back invest in its own people and just worry about itself.  If a sovereign nation attacks another sovereign nation then the us should attack the aggressor.  That should be our policy.  So if Israel attacks Lebanon in any way. We hit Israel.  If Lebanon attacks Israel we hit Lebanon.But that should be our policy.  We keep the peace by slaying bullies instead of acting stupid like we are now screwing up the whole region.As to Hezbollah my views are they are fine as long as they arent aggressors they can have their weapons but the expectation is that they only use them to protect Lebanon and all Lebanese.  ChristianDruze Sunni etc. A civil defense militia is fine but for defense only.,lebanon,ddg63x9,1,t5_2qzpg

11108569,0,t3_5ymd5q,Newly appointed Lebanese Army Commander Gen. Jospeh Aoun Friday called on soldiers to remain steadfast in the war against terrorism.I receive the command of the army in the midst of difficult regional circumstances as terror waves are still threatening the border of the country in an attempt to slip it into chaos and sedition Aoun said on the occasion of his title inauguration.Thousands of militants belonging to ISIS and Fatah alSham Front  formerly known as the Nusra Front  are believed to be holed up alongside the eastern border.The army pounds their hideouts on a near daily basis to keep them at bay and has carried out several arrests of suspected militants.Aoun also called on soldiers to set their sights on releasing nine servicemen who were abducted by Daesh ISIS to ensure their safe and swift return to their families and their institution.The nine soldiers have been held captive since Daesh along with Jabhat Fatah alSham briefly overran the northeast border town of Arsal in August .More than  soldiers and policemen were initially captured but most were released. Some were killed in captivity however and nine army personnel are still being held by Daesh.Aoun who succeeded Gen. Jean Kahwagi at the helm of the military expressed hope in soldiers who he said faced previous challenges with determination and resilience.Be ready along Lebanons southern border to fend off the threats of the Israeli enemy and to guarantee the implementation of U.N. Security Council resolution  in cooperation with the friendly international forces.He added that the new presidential term in Lebanon depended on the military to maintain comprehensive and sustainable security and stability ... which in turn ... is keen to fortify your the soldiers capabilities through local backing and the support of friendly and brotherly countries.I am honored with the great confidence given by the President Michel Aoun and the Cabinet that appointed me as the commander of the Lebanese Army he said.,lebanon,der5ad8,1,t5_2qzpg

So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruises door and Tom Cruise shoutsDave! Whats happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!Although impressed Daves boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruises house he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.No no just name anyone else Dave says.President Obama his boss quickly retorts.Yup Dave says Old buddies lets fly out to Washington and off they go. At the White House Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over saying Dave what a surprise I was just on my way to a meeting but you and your friend come on in and lets have a beer first and catch up.Well the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave who again implores him to name anyone else.Pope Francis his boss replies.Sure! says Dave. Ive known the Pope for years. So off they fly to Rome.Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vaticans St. Peters Square when Dave says This will never work. I cant catch the Popes eye among all these people. Tell you what I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and Ill come out on the balcony with the Pope. He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.Sure enough half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony but by the time Dave returns he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.Making his way to his boss side Dave asks him What happened?His boss looks up and says It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?,lebanon,dfcdkgb,1,t5_2qzpg

BUT when you break down Tripoli you get different accents too which is why some might say a hint of Koura here and something else over there. For example even though Tripoli is a city its also a district with Qalmoun amp El Mina where people will talk a bit differently. Then even Tripoli itself people from Abou Samra or some of the mountain towns like Baqasefreen will also have different accents despite being considered a part of Tripoli. Obviously when hes acting he might accentuate differently for the role or for emphasis etc which is all a part acting whilst some will be his natural accent. listen to Asad speak normallyAsad againFor example he says mnameleh not mnamalaaa with an accentuated end like you might expect him to do when acting. He also doesnt say mnamelha like other Lebanese accents might which is the trobolsi kicking in.The guy speaks as we call it TROBILSI A YA MALLEMListen to Mahmoud Mabsout here and youll see its very similarSo its important I think to realise that acting voices and accents may not directly reflect actual voice and accent.,lebanon,dg8v4ih,4,t5_2qzpg
