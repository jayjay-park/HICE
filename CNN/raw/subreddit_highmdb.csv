6686511,0,t3_477fq8,I hate screens of any kind if Im tripping but if I had to watch something it would be something like a quantum mechanics documentary or some sort of astronomy documentary with Neil Degrass Tyson or Morgan Freeman narrating. Nature documentary would also be cool if guess. But honestly go outside and trip in the woods or by a lake or somewhere with lots of life and natural light where you can make a connection with the universe.,highmdb,d0axzbt,4,t5_38q81
