647003,0,t1_cgdjgnl,Thanks! For coop are the postings generally paid or do they expect you to coop for free? If paid what range of payment do you see? And by postings do you mean that the school has an internal board that helps students find coop jobs so they dont have to do it alone?,niagaracollege,cgdtbxx,1,t5_2suxa
