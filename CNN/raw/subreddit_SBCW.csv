4931514,0,t3_3igcmu,SHOUT GUN SATURDAY NIGHTSeattleWA PT.Clip of the win by DC over EA the US champion followed by  post match madness reairsJC  League Of Nations now holds all the power.. however tonights story is about DI domination continues after last week EA regaining the US belt and tonight despite losing to DC DI still made their impactful marks over HH DC and S tonight. We still have Jive V Crave and the Four Way Fray. Are we in for more chaotic action or what Taddy?TB Normally I would think things can not possibly get more  hectic and rowdy but knowing the final matches still knowing the Worlds Champion is here tonight rumored to bring FOUR Nurses with him tonight....this night is is only gonna get more intense and I dig itJoey!JC You would Taddy you would! Puts s finger to his ear piece then nods.Speaking of thr World ChampionEmily Everready is standing by with a participant in Four Way Fray whos been on a mission and believes the title matchm Emily take it away with guest Cameron Bennett!taken backstage with EE with Cameron BennettEE Tonight Commissioner Crave has just put you in a fatal four way match in order to earn a shot at Dark Doctors World Championship at the Allegiance PPV your thoughts?CB Lovely isnt it? I have to prove myself worthy of a title that I was screwed out of by Nurse Ratshit... Sorry Ratchet. Proving myself wouldnt have been an issue if those two freaks hadnt interfered with my match last week. Which leads me to my point Crave you need to make sure they dont interfere because if I get screwed again the only thing youll crave is Morphine.back to the ringsideJC Its time for Geno Blazes exclusive Sit down Interview w Kahuna. This was filmed from studio where we filmed Out Of The Box.GB  Hello thanks for joining us Multiverse as I am joined tonight by the FORMER United States Champion a member of The League Of Nations he is The Hawaiian Destroyer Kahuna.Camera pans over to show that Kahuna is there with Kimona.GB  Welcome Kahuna.KAHUNA  Thank you Geno Its always a pleasure to chat with you. After all you held the Ring for me so I could propose to my Princess. Grasps Kimonas handKimona Domo Arrigoto GenoGB It was my pleasure Kimona.  Since day  it seems you have been on a collision course with Evan Almighty and his Divine Intervention. What has been your take on that rivalry and is the an end game for the ongoing war between the League of Nations and Divine Intervention?K Well it seems to me that the  of us Siren amp The Canadian Dragon with Angelica and JIVE and myself with the Fair but deadly Princess of Submission Kimona have proven that you can honorably win a Championship without resulting in using Dirty or questionable tactics just as you can by cheating like I did when I beat Evan in a fair oneonone matchup. But you can rest assured I WILL GET MY TITLE BACKGB We really cant mention the US Title without discussing the man who has had your number in SBCW Herbie Hughes. Weve seen him shatter guitars over your head on several occasions screwed you out of the US Title not to mention a moment where things got real person when one of his guitars struck your fiancee Kimona. What are your thought on Hughes and his mockery of you you with those guitars in cradles and his constant assaults on you and now Kimona?KI may have gotten sidelined with a slight knee malfunction but this is gonna be a picnic in Honolulu compared to what has been done AND WHAT WILL BE DONE to Herbie amp Evan when I get my hands on them again. You see since I lost The U S Title Kimona has reverted back to only speaking Japanese and will continue to do so until Justice has been served and Im wearing Gold again. You dont believe me? Just ask Nurse Ratchett.... if you can find her!  GB  Now last Saturday you were defending the US championship between both Hughes and Almighty in a Triple Threat match. Unfortunately youd be attacked early on my question is Kahuna do you know who was the one to attacked prior to that match? I suspected either Evan amp Herbie or both incoherence attacked me but the  of them put together dont have the intelligence that GOD gave a grape. Someone smarter than the  of them actually ordered the Backstage Assault on me. I have some suspicions but at this time everyone is guilty until proven innocent. I dont know for sure as to whoever ordered the attack but havent found concrete evidence to show exactly who is responsible GB  It still amazes me Kahuna that despite all that went down backstage you still mustered up real heart as you courageously would eventually make it to the match and try to defend your then US Title. Kahuna it was purely an inspiration to witness. Do you regret doing that and furthering your injury that at the time had no idea the significance of that injury?K  Absolutely Possitively GUARANDAMNTEED NOT. When I won the Title in the First Place I seriously took it as an obligation to The SBCW Multiverse to give it my ALL to defend that championship with everything I got and when that strength ran out I looked at my beloved Kimona and the Fans urging me on until I just couldnt stand the pain any further and I passed out!GB  Kahuna the Multiverse loves you and have been Tweeting about the huge controversial end to the match. Have you had a chance to view the match and the outcome? If so please share your thoughts on the match as a whole and who do you believe won?K  Actually I did see it. JIVE got one of the guys in the Production Truck to make a BluRay of the match and he brought it to me to look at after my knee procedure. I had plenty of opportunities to watch in SLOMO and Pause amp rewind amp rewatch. If you look VERY CAREFULLY youll see  referees making a pin count  on me when I passed out from Herbies Figure  leg lock and the other counting the pin on Herbie when Evan draped his arm over Hughess chest. The Referee who was making the count on me was just a slight beat off in his count thus Evan pinned Herbie just a half second before Herbie pinned me. Im a  year veteran Referee who knows about a Referees Cadence is EVERYTHING in a Championship Match and although I hate to say it Evan legitimately pinned Herbie first and won the Title because of Triple Threat Rules which is hindsight now as I was thinking about making it a total elimination match as well. I woke up after Herbie released the hold on me and I probably could have done a sneaky schoolboy on Evan after that but I didnt. I do maintain my Rematch clause which you can believe I WILL CASH IN.JPA  Finally Kahuna the question everyones been asking about. What  is the diagnosis of this injury and time table for your return if you can return at all?K Im getting examined Friday August  by SBCW Doctors if I can pass their inspection then Saturday August  when Shout Gun Saturday Night is in Atlanta Georgia is when I demand my Rematch against Evan JPA  There you have it Multiverse  Ladies and gentlemen this has been an exclusive interview with the very popular Kahuna. We take you back to the Key Arena in SeattleWA. THANK YOU for joining us. Back to you Joey!JC  Wow Kahuna a man of integrity an inspirational to fans all over the world.TB  Kahuna if you ask me is in denial if hes trying to convince anyone that hes not hurting and him returning by next week hes in complete fantasy land!TC Never count out The Kahuna.When we return Mack meets Taylor Bat on a pole match.
