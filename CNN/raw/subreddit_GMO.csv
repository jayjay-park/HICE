1684231,0,t3_2do8h3,gtBy artificially selecting through careful breeding of plantsanimals one is merely combining genes from a species pool that have been combining and recombining for centuriesNot true. Artificial selection also includes mutagensis and horizontal gene transfer. Both ways of introducing novel traits into populations.gt and being consumed by people with no ill effect.Actually there have been many sometimes deadly ill effects. Carcinogenic celery that blisters farmers hands. Nightshade laced potatoes that poison and kill. Even cyanide producing grass have inadvertently been created by careless artificial breeding. Whats worse is that despite the thousands of and thousands of documented poisonings and deaths we have zero regulation on their release and little public concern. This is contrast to GM crops which are heavily regulated and have never been shown to cause human health harm to anyone anywhere ever.gtTherefore surely we can have more confidence of the safety of interbreedingbased modification that we can with a crossspecies labbased approachI think the dead herd of cattle from the article above disagrees.,GMO,cjrgl8u,5,t5_2s7ab
1686670,0,t3_2do8h3,Here is what you are essentially doing by framing this a debate over whether GMO is fine or notYou are ignoring the actual traits of the crops in question in lieu of how they got the traits.Does it matter how an entirely harmless variety of corn became harmless? Not with respect to health its harmless after all.You have essentially framed the question thuslygtNormally Im open minded about whether carpenters can hold the hammer with their left hand but Im having a hangup. Carpenters have been holding the hammer with their right hand for millennia.What is absolutely essential to take away from this type of phrasing is that concern of the root causes of whether the table will be safe have been entirely ignored. You are not concerned about the actual qualities the table has but rather how it got them.Genetic engineering is a type of technology it is a tool. It simply is another way for us to get desired traits expressed by our crops. You cannot lose sight of the forest for the treesWhat matters in terms of safety for any crop is the actual traits and qualities that crop has not how it came to acquire them.,GMO,cjrrp5w,4,t5_2s7ab

2043709,0,t1_ckzgmq1,gtWhy should we reform the system if we can get by without the reforms? Good point people tend to prefer the status quo or at least lack the motivation to change it even when the change would help them.gtLike new enviromentallyfriendly agriculture which produces cheaper food using GMOs?But would it be possible to produce even more environmentallyfriendlier food which would cost a bit more? For varying values of a a bit which would only be acceptable to consumers in the West.gtCry toxin producing plants decrease pesticide use by half and RoundupReady plants decrease soil erosion and safety testing generally decreases risks associated with agriculture.I think there are other ways to decrease soil erosion. Isnt notill plowing a feature on most new tractors already? But more importantly  is it possible to farm and have very high yields without any herbicides and pesticides? I think this has been done on very small scales with a lot of human labor. The resulting food prices are very high. But I wonder just how far the price could be lowered if we try to scale that up with the kind of super cheap  labor most often used in farming? And I have no idea.  But farm work is now starting to use robots  And again I have to wonder could robots remove the need for herbicides and pesticides with anything like comparable costs? And again I have no clue.gt But then why do you think cheaper food is worth the risks of agricultural reforms?Its not just the cheaper food it is also the corrupting influence of subsidies which make it necessary for lobbying to make sure the subsidies continue or grow. Also I perceive zero risk from removing subsidies. It is a purely financial matter and removing tariffs and trade restrictions would guarantee access to the cheapest foods in the world.gtYou are completely comfortable ignoring the positive effects of one revolution yet wonder why people do not see the possible positive effects of another one.I dont think that is completely fair. For example I want GMOs producing drugs. Also I think some agricultural GMOs are so good everyone should use them. For example if this work  successfully gets cyanobacteria like photosynthesis in agricultural plants then the difference would be gigantic and absolutely everyone should use them. I realize only half the work or less has been done so far but this has potential that I get truly excited about. As opposed to Golden rice where I knew the original study had cooked it with g of butter and I thought it was deeply flawed.Also I am not favoring GMO agriculture over nonGMO agriculture. I am trying to figure out what the most sustainable and least risky agriculture could be.  Which may well include GMOs. But it may also be organic. Especially if it is possible to get rid  of the grandfather organic pesticides like copper sulphates. Which again may not be possible or might be possible with more labor and higher food prices. And organic farming is less productive but the gap appears to be small  And maybe there are ways to close it again with more labor which may be human or robot.Now I do have to honestly ask myself am I totally comfortable with robots and not with glyphosate because I am a computer scientists or because today robots are objectively less dangerous than glyphosate?Is it just my personal bias that me think spraying RoundUp on your front lawn where your young kids play to kill dandelions is dumb but I have no problem with robotic lawn mowers?,GMO,ckzlmrk,1,t5_2s7ab

They are a weed when they are outside of their desired distribution and are abundant enough for us to notice them or their effects typically negative ones.We is human society that participates in the domestication of plants for agriculture. This includes everyone that consumes agricultural products as they are participating in the system. That probably includes most of the human race excepting surviving hunter gatherer societies.,GMO,cnopxim,1,t5_2s7ab

6221261,0,t1_cywpawh,Bt protein works by attaching to a specific receptor in the insect gut  a receptor humans dont have.  In order for it to become toxic to humans it would have to gain some new unrelated function.  This is extremely unlikely.  Further there is no reason to particularly expect this protein to gain some new toxic protein as opposed to the thousands of new natural mutant proteins you eat regularly.,GMO,cywsgd8,5,t5_2s7ab
