4354055,0,t1_csgchx3,I was with you right up to Governors.  I had a really bad dinner there last year  but have had much success with the drinks menu and the entertainment!  The Highwheeler Cafe in Baddeck where the AGB Museum is has a fantastic trail lunch.  And really great oatcakes.  Louisberg takes pretty much your whole day given its location if youre staying in Baddeck.  Unless youre TOTALLY into fortresses its a whole day you may not wish to waste. If youre into hiking there are some really fantastic trails and hidden gems.  Id go whale watching at Pleasant Bay andor the quick tour of Baddeck Bay on the Amoeba.  Have fun and enjoy!,CapeBreton,csgfnt7,0,t5_2s93w
5106763,0,t3_3kxdt8,I work at CBU.  I interact with newcomers all day everyday.  I love talking to them!  But some coworkers are there to just do a job.  Talk stamp next.  I cant function that way.I want students new to the island to have the best experience they can that I can control anyway.  But the actual friends portion is difficult.  I know what its like to feel lonely and I really dont want others to feel the same.,CapeBreton,cv1k0tj,1,t5_2s93w

8506057,0,t1_d64rjhs,Yeah theres a campground around there owned I believe still by Mike Crimp hes a family friend and a good guy. I forget if he still runs the campground  he used to own the Wreck Cove General Store but I think he sold that but I think hes still running the campground. Lots of good places to hike and the Wreck Cove beach is... Well interesting. Its all rocks rounded rocks from sons of erosion. No sand at all but we used to go there all the time all the same to swim. A little ways down the beach is a huge rock thats been there since time immemorial and thats where we used to hang out. There other beaches in the area too of course but that ones a bit special cause thats where my family used to set out from for lobster fishing many years ago. Anyways yeah talk to Mike Crimp who according to Google is still owner at the Wreck Cove campground and hell hook you up. There also used to be a campground at Breton Cove a little further to the south maybe  minutes south of Wreck Cove. Not sure if its still open as it passed hands a few times over the years. ,CapeBreton,d64t8q2,4,t5_2s93w

11250768,0,t3_60l1u1,A connector program is good to have but hopefully it also features a public strategy plan for Cape Breton such that would be investors in business can see what CB has to offer.  It has a local CollegeUniversity and Vocational Trades Regional Hospital Airport deep water Piers a Regional Police Service and local power generation.  You would figure with that infrastructure there would be more business coming to town.  Nothin is perfect but if you want people to buy in to a prosperous future then someone needs to sell a picture of the possibilities.  Go get em.,CapeBreton,df79ato,1,t5_2s93w

Policing in a tough job that requires a thick skin but with anything if you treat people with respect you usually get that it return.  Safe to say the criminal minded will not share that line of thought.,CapeBreton,dfih4po,1,t5_2s93w
