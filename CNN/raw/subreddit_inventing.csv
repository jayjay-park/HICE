5063242,0,t1_cuvy9vo,Haha.  NICE! When did you get diagnosed?Im coping. Sometime its really good amp sometimes its so so. But overall when I look at the overall picture Im doing ten times better. I can think of a long term goal and have the discipline to complete it. I do whatever research work needs to be done. I still dont want to do a lot of the work but I CAN do it. I can motivate myself to do things that need to be done etc.I socialize better higher self esteem healthier emotional patterns more exersizing better at work..... Its been about  months since i got diagnosed. The difference is day and night. ,inventing,cuwb98v,1,t5_2sq0a
