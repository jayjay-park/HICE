961122,0,t3_252dwa,I really wanted to love this.... But the pose just doesnt do it for me. I love the detail in the suit however. Will wait to see if it grows on me. ,Marvel_Daredevil,chdjedy,1,t5_2u4xn
1752678,0,t3_2ejbd6,I dont think its considered canon  any more that Daredevil Noir is considered canon. I feel like the story had some good moments for DD and his dad but the ending was pretty WTF. ,Marvel_Daredevil,ck0303q,3,t5_2u4xn

If they ask say it was TYP A MS GXXXX a street cleaner was using it and you got splashed.    AND THAT STREET CLEANERS NAME WAS MATT MURDOCK ,Marvel_Daredevil,cq7jyx4,12,t5_2u4xn

3654668,0,t3_328ha7,I felt like near the end of the scene it was meant to be comical the way they all kept getting back up and it just kept going. It only added to my enjoyment of the scene.,Marvel_Daredevil,cq8uwhf,10,t5_2u4xn

3671074,0,t1_cqadbes,Darn! Admittedly I dont know much about Jessica Jones so I was a bit more excited about Iron Fist. But I cant be sad  everything thats come out of the Marvel has basically topped itself thus far. ,Marvel_Daredevil,cqaq5tc,1,t5_2u4xn

3679635,0,t1_cqbes4q,Spoilers Ahead I definitely wouldnt call it an exaggerated love triangle. At first it starts off as FoggyltKaren KarenltMatt and MattltClaire. Throughout the season though Matt and Claire just dont work out but they remain really good friends and still care deeply for each other. Foggy starts off by crushing on Karen for most of the season but they never really end up working out and then Foggy ends up with his exgirlfriend who starts off as a total bitch but she redeems herself by the end. As for Matt and Karen they certainly both likelike each other and Season  laid the ground works for a potential future relationship. With Karen its pretty obvious shes crushing on Matt all season but in Matts case there was one scene that stood out when they first met Elena and Karen was translating even though Matt understood Spanish he told her to continue as he liked listening to her voice. While this seems like a baseless flirtation but later in the season during a flashback in college when Foggy asks what type of girl he is looking for he tells him I guess someone I really  like listening to.,Marvel_Daredevil,cqbpaw5,3,t5_2u4xn
3704135,0,t3_323khf,I like how humanized Kingpin is portrayed. The best villains have a twisted logic that could make sense from a POV and this show does a good job of doing that for Fisk.,Marvel_Daredevil,cqehvhq,14,t5_2u4xn

3762780,0,t1_cqi0wx5,Really Nobu was going to kill him. So DD killed him. Theres a difference between murdering a villain in cold blood and killing someone in selfdefense. There were similar complaints when Batman shot people trying to protect the bomb in TDKR and it didnt make sense there either.Thank god there was no agonizing over this.,Marvel_Daredevil,cql6o8d,2,t5_2u4xn
