704033,0,t3_20xed1,I hate this. Its great to do that but raising bill payment option to  is horrible. It was way better for me and so much faster. Plus you only need to be level one verified ,BitcoinCA,cgkauu9,1,t5_2wqe8
2286107,0,t3_2la8mw,QuadrigaCX does seem like a great exchange from the looks of it. Respectable fees for the most part and they offer Interac etransfer withdrawals which is real nice. But truthfully now that QuadrigaCX is charging  for Interac deposits Im going to continue to use CaVirtex and VOS when they have a flat rate of . and . fee respectively for Interac Online deposits. Nice to see Quadriga stand out though having ads I constantly see on YouTube and promoting merchant services and all their verification method seems nice as well. Edit Quadriga changed Interac Online fee to . thats actually pretty reasonable if you are only doing small amount. ,BitcoinCA,clua2rd,0,t5_2wqe8
2779856,0,t3_2r4xzt,Just to be clear ... We require no ID for you to deposit BTC sell it and then withdraw the fiat.  This is the perfect option for those doing arbitrage miners or if you are moving your holdings from VoS to QCX but now want to remain unverified.,BitcoinCA,cnk26gb,2,t5_2wqe8

5862638,0,t3_3vjkkk,The rumors are true.  However no need to pay their  fee.  If you require fiat simply withdraw your coins and sell them on QuadrigaCX or buy coins with your fiat and then sell them on QCX.  We dont charge any fees for almost all withdrawal options.  Same applies to most funding options.  See full list ataglance here ,BitcoinCA,cxo4ek6,12,t5_2wqe8

6414969,0,t3_43h8o0,Yeah spreads are tighter and theres much more liquidity on the EUR pair. And youre right that we dont do fiat FX. But we just acquired Cavirtex and merged in all accounts so hopefully CAD will pick up! We also offer dark market CAD trading and can facilitate large block trades through our trading desk.p.s. Im seeing a  spread right now on CAD.  was anomalous.,BitcoinCA,czitf9u,2,t5_2wqe8

10848706,0,t3_5v22l2,If youre willing to accept a  hit in order to buy btc either youre desperate to unload your unwanted Amazon gift cards or you have carded Amazon gift cards. I used to do Perk and Swag Bucks to earn some beer money and the PayPal CAD point conversion rate is abysmal compared to the USD Amazon rate. So I would trade Amazon ecodes regularly. But there is so much fraud with ecodes that no one trusts ecode trading anymore. Purse io is riddled with ridiculous levels of fraud on the part of the person doing the Amazon ordering.,BitcoinCA,ddyyudf,1,t5_2wqe8
