You could also say raise just to clarify for sure that youre intending to raise.One thing you CANNOT do is go back for more chips for a raise without declaring it.  In other words in the example above you cannot put out  and then reach back for  more  doing this is called a string bet and is not allowed in pretty much any casino.  You must put all  out in one motion.Also another subtle thing is say someones bet  in front of you and you want to raise to  so you throw out a  chip.  This would count as a CALL.  The reason this is different than the previous example is when you throw out a chip and its unclear whether its a raise or call and you dont declare it verbally itll default to being a call.  In the previous example when you put out  theres no confusion as to whether youre calling or raising.But in general if you want to avoid any confusion just declare raise anytime you want to raise and you wont run into any problems.Other than that youll find that live play and online play are pretty much the same.,gambling,ctmbfna,3,t5_2qhuo

The testing standards used by those labs are usually published and available to the public. I would wager that most standards for electronic roulette are very specific in how the random number generator should work. Just like a physical wheel the electronic version should give each possible outcome equal probability of being selected on every game. Otherwise its not roulette and the game would not be fair or legal. The testing labs rigorously verify that this is the case before they approve.,gambling,cvb9wz6,2,t5_2qhuo

9724445,0,t3_5ddbsw,Let me tell you man... those promos are a trap. Im on this board right now looking for posts about gambling problems and let me explain why I play poker. Im not terrible at it and I play online at  cent  cent tables its fun and its good practice for the live games I play in. Im a consistent winner at poker Ive been playing for  years I dont ever get impulsive. Poker barely feels like gambling to me Ive been doing it so long. Poker is not the issue.Now recently Bovada was bought and became Ignition poker. I moved all my money over and got a new depositor bonus. Unfortunately you cannot unlock any of that money with poker you have to play with it. Now I hope im not being patronizing but your question makes me think you arent very familiar with online gambling so Ill explain it to show why its much worse than it seems. They have a concept called rollover which means that you have to wager X times the amount to unlock your money and these requirements are bonkers. X is common. So for example to get  dollars of bonus money you have to place a total of  in bets. Thats if youre playing slots. Other games count for less like blackjack because their edge is lower. On Ignition blackjack credit builds at . That means that to unlock  dollars in bonus money you would have to place a grand total of  dollars in bets. Some sites dont count blackjack at all. Additionally keep in mind that any free money they give you is going to be treated the same as a deposit bonus. In order to get it you have to clear that rollover. Good luck with that.  Think of it like this if you bet with the free money and you win you cannot cash that money out until youve cleared your entire bonus. So even if you won a bit early on you still have to keep gambling. Honestly these bonuses are incredibly insidious. Its a ploy to get you to join and make a real money deposit. Then you can keep gambling to unlock your bonus and lose all your real money. So while you may have nothing to lose if you get a free sign up bonus I would say its very close to impossible to build it up and hit your rollover before you lose it. I just lost  trying to unlock  in bonus money money I had previously used exclusively to play poker.  I also just learned that I become a completely uncontrollable gambler playing blackjack. It was unreal I lost complete control of myself. I know all the warning signs of a gambling problem and it meant nothing while it was happening. Started out betting  a hand played for an hour or so and I had only unlocked like  dollars of that bonus money. Bumped my bets up to  then ... started getting really low bet . Won. Back to betting  lost that . Did it again ad nauseam. Eventually I was betting  a hand and periodically throwing in  bets. It was gone within minutes. I tell that story just to highlight that I did exactly what they wanted me to and what they want everybody to do. A lot of people just play poker so they have to figure out a way to get you into their casino games these free promotions are how that happens. You cant beat them at their own game they know exactly what theyre doing. If offering those promotions didnt work in their favor they wouldnt do it. Edit Changed did to didnt right at the end. ,gambling,dabr1eb,1,t5_2qhuo
