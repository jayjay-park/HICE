2540154,0,t1_cmq02vf,Well I meant visitors from other cities. I guess they dont really want those kinds of people in their city though so of course theyd set it to a rate thats pocket change for their targeted customer base. ,eastbay,cmq4unr,1,t5_2s4if

3953246,0,t3_35qlvu,Take a ferry over to Alcatraz. Ive been in the Bay Area all my life and just recently went there for the first time. A little touristy but really cool experience IMO. And while youre on the ferry theres Angel Island that has a lot of history and great views of the Bay Area. If theyre into hiking a little bit theres the Marin Headlands by the Golden Gate bridge where you can walk to the military barracks,eastbay,cr6wjgz,3,t5_2s4if

5117486,0,t3_3l36vk,Ive been to Shell Ridge after dark without issue though if its listed as being against the rules theres always a chance youll run into trouble and Ive only been after dark once or twice. Ive been to Lime Ridge after dark countless times without issue both from the Treat Blvd parking lot entrance and the residential Court Lane entrance so I can speak more to that than Shell Ridge. But tbh I doubt youll get in trouble if you arent doing anything egregious which it doesnt sound like you would be. EDIT also I believe they keep the exit from Mt. Diablo open at night so I think you could go in the evening while its still light and then exit at your leisure though I havent tested this since probably  so it could have changed though I doubt it would since blocking the exit seems like it would be a big hazard. I think youd probably get a better view up there ,eastbay,cv2uk54,3,t5_2s4if
