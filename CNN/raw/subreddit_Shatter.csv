2432094,0,t1_clud0bh,Next time you cut something instead of holding it down in the sink to catch the blood apply pressure to the wound with some clean absorbant material bandage and support it above your heart. Sitting down would be good too to lower your blood pressure. Plus go to AampE,Shatter,cmcbawd,2,t5_2t9q3

7764227,0,t1_d3oo5n7,They have him on crutches but havent seen a doctor really since it initially happened and we got back to Canada. He is on crutches with no weight bearing but he says he can feel the rod and its really uncomfortable. Im glad youre back up and going sorry that that happened to you! And yeah thats what im trying to tell him hes stubborn though so hopefully he does take it easy. He thinks hes bionic now with this rod in his leg.,Shatter,d3oqcr1,2,t5_2t9q3
