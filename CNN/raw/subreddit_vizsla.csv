2611462,0,t3_2ppqy9,My Delilah has never climbed a ladder but she is definitely gifted in the climbing department.  I kenneled her when I went to Jamaica and told the lady working there that she could climb chainlink fence.  Well when the lady comes outside later her house was right next to the mortonbuilding that served as the kennel there was an extra dog playing with her two dogs at the house.  Delilah had climbed the ft fence to escape her individual run to get into the common area and climbed another ft fence to escape that as well.  The lady ended up leaving a large piece of sheetmetal over the top opening of Delilahs run to prevent another escape attempt.Ive also watched her clear a ft fence at almost top speed when she was trying to chase a deer who was outside the dog park.  Shes so damn fast that I was actually worried that she might catch it.  ,vizsla,cmzgef6,1,t5_2touw

3555995,0,t3_310si8,Im definitely not saying that it is as I am no doctor but I once had a GSP with similar issues. It turned out that he had Addisons disease. Again not saying thats what it is but it could be. My first sign that something was wrong was that he would just pee randomly while walking drinking water siting down randomly. And I guess thats a sign of the disease early on. Regardless I hope you can find an answer for your girl!!,vizsla,cpxlvha,2,t5_2touw

4942794,0,t3_3ilulr,Bones Bull Pizzles Raw Hides Antlers Kong w Peanut butter etc. And lots of variety. Our V will go to town on them while we watch TV. He gets bored of one after  minutes so we always have several different kinds for him to chew on. He just goes from one to the other and gives us a few hours of peace  Hope that helps,vizsla,cuhku85,7,t5_2touw
5018356,0,t3_3jnk0w,Our V was  when our son was born. She was a bit spooked when we brought him home and had to get used to not being able to get the attention she normally did. I fussed her a lot when not occupied with a newborn to let her know she was still very much loved and shes fine now. Shes really patient with him now hes a toddler. He chases her about hugs and kisses her. Its adorable to watch. Shes really protective of him when other dogs come close to him when were out. Shes also good with our nieces. If she gets chased shell just run away to safety. Having said that wed still never leave them alone together. Shes an animal and hes a child. Our V also had no problem with house training. She was paying at the back door to go outside to do her business a couple of weeks after we brought her home. ,vizsla,cuqwih2,1,t5_2touw

9402790,0,t1_d909ixs,Neither breed is self cleaning. Its true that smooths as a less coated breed produce less dander and therefore need bathed less frequently assuming they dont enjoy getting themselves dirty as some do but all creatures need to have occasional baths some at different frequencies than others. While a smooth should probably have a bath monthly to help keep their skin and hair clean and healthy and keep from an excess of body oil a wire should be bathed only when necessary. The wire coat is more brittle and can be damaged more easily with frequent bathing also their skin dries out more frequently. When they are bathed its ideal to use a wireterrier coat specific shampoo amp conditioner because it is specially formulated for their skin amp coats. In the event that they are simply muddy I find it best to use water only most of the time and sometimes I just let the mud dry and brush it out of the coat once it has. Yes a wire coat must be stripped. How hard that is and how much time that takes depends on the dogs coat and how well it has been maintained. A broken coated dog partial wire has a sparse jacket of wire hair with an undercoat that when exposed looks not unlike that of a smooth. They dont need stripped very often and the coat they do get isnt very intensive. A full wire is stripping intensive and can take several hours of nonstop work to get it all out if not maintained and doing it from scratch. It is important to strip it and never cut it though since cutting it ruins the quality of the coat and allows the dead hair to remain in the hair follicles which can clog them preventing new healthy hair from growing and can lead to skin issues and discomfort. Heres a pic showing the difference between stripped and unstripped.Temperament is variable. Overall Id say theyre similar but more sensitive and require a great deal more socialization to more things to be a welladjusted canine. If youre the type of person to take your dog everywhere this shouldnt be much of an issue. If you never take your dog anywhere but will expect them to be okay with new people places and things if ever they arise youre going to have a very under socialized dog with behavioral issues. Weather resistance ABSOLUTELY. This is one of the things the breed was bred for. Im in the northeast US. She was from the deep south. She was in for a nasty surprise her first winter with me and it did take her off guard. But she quickly adjusted and now LOVES winter.,vizsla,d97vcbu,1,t5_2touw
