7591978,0,t3_4j84vw,Reading their guidelines they have way too many rules about what a meetup can and cant be. For instance they are REQUIRED to meet in person and not online.Its silly. How do these rules benefit them? They should just be a general tool for organizing events regardless of content or venue. Google calendar doesnt tell you what type of events you can and cannot have on your calendar.Meetup is not a platform intended for such content or activities is a stupid statement. Building a useful tool and putting stupid limitations on it makes me not want to use it. If I could buy a hammer that explicitly refused to work on screws Id instead buy the model that didnt discriminate against what it hit.,censorship,d3564m5,2,t5_2qoft

8790427,0,t1_d74gwmd,gt there is a character account limit and the fluff needed to be removed to meet this.Thats not the rule. Thats what you want the rule to be. It follows the rules is not It follows what I WANT the rules to be.This is the rulegtDo not add remove words or change words. Where does the rule say fluff can be removed.? The rule explicitly says  Not remove words if you need to. Its the exact opposite of the very explicit wording of  the rule. Grow the fuck up and stop lying to yourself because reality is too much for you to handle. What do you think you gain by making a fool of yourself and establishing people of your cause as delusional liars?Sorry dude its over. Youve done nothing but harm your causes credibility because you cant get past your biases and the resulting misconceptions.,censorship,d74h95s,3,t5_2qoft
