670072,0,t3_21tltz,Is the game firstperson or thirdperson?  Im a little sleepy this morning and am not sure whats going on in that picture sorry!If its firstperson I did something similar in UDK by setting the objects render settings so that itd always be rendered last thus show up on top of everything.  Ill have to look up what the setting was called in UDK and Im not sure what itd be in UE but Id imagine the option is there somewhere.  In fact Id check out any of the sample games they give to see how they handle it.  If you have the time to hunt for it that is.If thirdperson what the other guy said sounds kinda cool.  If theres a way to just change the players collision bounds to include the arm you could also try that but Id only recommend that if the arms always gonna be sticking out might make it hard to navigate the level.  I havent done much in thirdperson yet unfortunately.,unrealengine,cggfpur,1,t5_2x11n

Most games on the market do not support hyper threading however hyperthreading would be useful for compiling rendering converting baking ect. If you have the money to go i I say do it because if you plan to make a game you will use it.For animations and modeling you need a modeling program like dsmax maya or Blender which is free.

1918566,0,t3_2g0wxw,basically doing it the way you have is going to be problematic. as there could be another bullet that goes through while your bullet enter andor leaving.It might be best to do this on bullet itself. For every update you trace toward your velocity direction for say around  tick range. If you hit something then use a interface call to determine if your direction can pass through or notreturn a bool. If true use either setCollisionProfileNamethis is preferred or setCollisionResponse to All Channels to toggle between overlap or block. Then its up to the walldoorfence bp to decide which way to bullet is coming that determines if bullet can go through or not from interface call implementation.edit if your bullet is going really fast that it is unlikely to hit different things and probably die in say  frames time. you probably want to do things like hit scan which will be more efficient.,unrealengine,ckkdh8e,1,t5_2x11n
1969628,0,t1_ckqf82y,If youre getting random models from the internet itll probably be touch and feel since you may not know the unit scale the modeler was working with. If youre making them yourself then you just need to figure out what the difference is between the unit scale in the software you make the models in and the Unreal Unit then scale all your models by that amount when you import them this is what the Scale Factor in UEs importer does which saves you having to rescale every object you place in the world.If youre getting models from lots of different places then you might want to make yourself a ruler you can import into the game world to compare against other models. Just make some long object of a known length in Unreal Units by default  Unreal Unit   cm and if you know that the model youre trying to import should be X meters you should be able to figure out the right scale factor just by comparing it against your ruler. Bonus points if you texture your ruler with accurate length gradations ,unrealengine,ckqjhjd,2,t5_2x11n

3033287,0,t1_coc8wva,That sounds like a pretty neat implementation! Do you use separate actors for everything though? For large maps that would quickly become quite slow. If you arent already Id suggest having some way to convert your tiles to instanced static meshes which help with framerate immensely.Im using pawns for my units though I might actually just as well have used regular actors as they dont need to be possessed and I dont use the regular navmesh.Im doing as much as I possibly can within the grid blueprint itself with only minimal logic contained within the actors. Actors are moved along a spline which feeds a float to the animation blueprint that drives an animation blueprint blend space for walkingrunning. Animations are called from the grid blueprint by calling a custom event in the animation blueprint that toggles a bool that tells the AnimBP what animation to switch to. In some cases I then use animation notifies at the end of animation to again launch new custom events in the grid blueprint. Hope that makes sense I also havent touched the behaviour tree stuff and have set up all the AI myself in the grid blueprint.,unrealengine,cocecx4,1,t5_2x11n
3100783,0,t1_cojdk6s,Depends on the asset.  Many of the good ones are sold in FBX format which makes it trivial.

I managed to get a lot of good D models this way to work from Unity store to UE animations textures everything.Its more difficult with some... you basically just do the same deal as above but add the step of opening it in a D editor like Max or Maya then exporting the thing back out as FBX before importing into Unreal.

Its kind of like it cant work out how to go from  degrees to  so does a full negative  twist to get back to normality.ANYWAY usually if you slightly rotate the spline point before or after around the spline axis  the X axis I think in your example  unreal will figure it out and your twist will disappear.,unrealengine,cpcexxy,1,t5_2x11n

3434819,0,t1_cpjq3ek,You know I agree with most of what you said.  I agree that more resources provided in the sidebar will help.  Youre right that a lot of people will probably ignore it just as they do now.However referring to history and online communities in general there are a couple of possibilities.  We could just deal with that.  One result is the sub gets flooded with questions that are answered in the first few minutes of videos explaining how to use UE.  More experienced devs leave potentially creating a new place to talk openly and ask questions then again maybe they dont.  The other which is less likely is that it just eventually stops.  Problem is unless Epic charges for the engine again it will remain free  and until the end of its lifecycle these same questions will continue.On the other hand the idea of adding to the sidebar stepping up the moderation adding tags or even adding additional sister subreddits have merit.  All of them could contributing to a solution.  Or we can pretend there arent any problems.  Dont know about you but Ive seen more than a handful of pro  year old devs making the next big MMO all over other communities.  Yet to play one yet though  theyre still waiting on someone to tell them exactly what to put in all their code.  Perhaps getting together and coming up with ideas on how to approach the issue rather than claiming it cant be done or we should ignore it will be more productive and beneficial for everyone.TLDR We could stick our heads in the sand and pretend like things cant be improved or we can actually brainstorm and come up with a solution.

4093513,0,t3_37axuf,Hi there! ElectricalComputer Engineer here who went on to be a AAA level designer.I think Id need some more info before really being able to tell you what to do. Why do you feel that you need to learn a D modeling program? Are you passionate about D modeling? What is your end goal  to make games? Why Blender? There are way better tools out there and you may be able to get a student discount on them. Have you thought about particlesVFX? They require artistic flair as well as logical analytical thought to create. Have you thought about creating materials? Thats a major part of creating D models these days and material design can be facilitated by knowledge of mathematics and good problem solving skills. You even get to use linear algebra for some of it! What would you expect to do in UE?,unrealengine,crmvwbr,1,t5_2x11n

4475302,0,t3_3cecqy,In addition to the other comments I will say having a team helps tremendously. As well as brute force determination and strength of will. There will be the hard times. If you can have at least one other person to help provide backup along the way be it mentally or spiritually have faith in yourself that you will prevail. While I dont have experience with Unity personally Im sure your overall plight isnt engine specific. And likely rolling your own engine is no option eitherif youre set in your game design and already relies on UEs huge featureset. By using UE you get to stand on the shoulders of giants. However at some point youll be navigating brand new waters and youll have to sometimes dog paddle to survive. Anyways I know Im not supplying any actually useful information but me and two friends from college have managed to do this using Epics software and we dont fear release and launch our independent title. It sounds like you may be dealing with multiplayer which in and of itself sounds rightly intimidating. As an indie you have to play to your strengths. We transitioned from UDK to UE and now solely utilize Blueprints.  Not sure precisely where I can help but reach out if you have any specific questions.,unrealengine,csus6p3,3,t5_2x11n

But it doesnt fit your scene so lets try to figure out whats causing the light to interact with the post process volume in such a weird way. In your post process volume try setting lens flare intensity to . If that doesnt fix the issue try decreasing the Bloom intensity. On the light actor itself try experimenting with some of its settings including Min Roughness  which affects how the lights brightness reacts to shiny materials like the walls and floors in your scene. EDIT Also mess with the Light Source Radius! This could be the most helpful. Just occurred to me.As for the tiles try disabling their shadowing rebuild the scenes lighting and then see if the issue persists.

The problem is epic relies too much on the community helping itself and didnt write new and up to date documentation or tutorials for a long time. Even for us bigger developers this is a pretty big deal because we also need tutorials to understand how some features work in Unreals context and if those are completely outdated we end up not using Unreals builtin systems but coding our own which takes more time and burns away the budget.

5199028,0,t1_cvcly9g,Alright heres how I would go at it and how I know most dev would go.If Im understanding things correctly you will need different actors in various level that you will make statically but they need to be wildly modular as in easily configurable and usable by artists.You are completely right with using C theres no other way to go at it. I believe the easiest way would be to find correct abstraction for your framework and then making it highly parametrable probably with .ini configuration files that would be loaded with the levels and so forth.the blueprints would be mostly parameters and variables. Some would be accessible to the artist using UPROPERTY macros while other properties would be statically loaded in an .ini file provided by your interface. Youll probably need to code some sort of library for UE Editor I guess? The way you put it is very vague and I understand you have an actual precise idea that you dont want to get stolen. It really depends on the scale of the project but I dont see any problem with doing only fullc actors with editable default properties and dynamically then spawning form statically loaded files  probably some homebrew editor modifications. its going to take a lot of work tho Am I answering you correctly?,unrealengine,cvcocke,1,t5_2x11n

Then just have your particular meshes check if they are ever overlapping on of these light blueprint shapes. Im sure you could also figure out how much of the mesh is overlapping with a little more math and feed those values to your variable.You may need to add in some trace checks to account for instances when something is blocking the actual light but it should be doable I think.,unrealengine,cxd133k,1,t5_2x11n

Then if it hits anything whos hit normals z value break the hit and then break the hit normal is less than like . or . meaning its a relatively vertical wall then allow the wall jump bool to turn on which if you hit the jump button again and the bool is true then go ahead and call the launch function where the direction is your velocity plus the wall normal scaled by some number which is your impulse off the wall.  That should be everything you need.  Shameless plug warningHowever Ive got an inexpensive blueprint which allows for Wall Running and Wall Jumping on the marketplace now if you dont want to fool with it.  I just released a major update which includes full body first person and a timer option.  With my asset you can decide if the player can only wall jump so many times before hitting the ground whether they can only wall jump off different walls same for wall running.  You can change the wall jump height and impulse away from the wall as well as whether the input controls have a large influence on the wall jump imagine you jump off a wall but your still pressing forward towards it do you want the player to hit the wall again or does the wall jump override the directional input to some extent.  You can change the Wall Run height and length making any type of arc for the wall run.  You can have a super long horizontal run a very high and short in distance wall run or anything in between.  It can look very quadratic or very linear.  With the new timer feature if you want to only be able to Wall Jump you can set that very low like . or so and then that means as soon as the player hits the wall runjump button they have to release to wall jump or nothing really happens they just rotate towards the wall maybe plant a foot down and then fall.  But no jump off.  You could set it to something like . and theyll wall run for a little and then fall off.  The timer option also allows you to decide if you want to reset the timer after every wall jump or only when you hit the ground.  ,unrealengine,cy0y4gf,2,t5_2x11n

6260288,0,t3_41byak,You can create a complete game using just blueprints if you wish. In Unreal  they are treated as first class citizens and anything you can do with code you can also do with them.  While its rare you can find yourself in a situation where a plugin or third party piece of code is not exposed to the blueprint system and will need to get your hands dirty and write some C code. That said its a rare situation and even then you could do the necessary code just following the docs instructions and some trial and error.  Another case where you could hit a wall with blueprints is on more complex algorithms for things like random generation of terrain or anything with tons of nested loops as those cases could hit the execution limit for blueprints. Its another rare situation and in most of those cases you really should be doing those operations on code for performance reasons anyway but i think it should be warned.,unrealengine,cz1850o,4,t5_2x11n

6625452,0,t1_d04gwp6,Oh so your item is basically only a struct!?Ive never heard it done that way before. Usually your item is an object and structs only contain a bit of data.I guess that works just fine as is then...Keep in mind that you will not be able to have specials on your weapons like this. They can only hold stats or your code gets really ugly real fast. And you should definitely use different actors for different actors for your item types. Making it so you can use everything with just one actor is quite the nightmare and you definitely will run into tons of issues and bugs as well as tons of unused overhead code on every single actor in your level. Your armor cant be consumed or equipped as a weapon. Its just a mess.,unrealengine,d04mn8v,1,t5_2x11n

I tried Life is Strange again and it ran at  FPS for just a few minutes then dropped to  FPS. So it doesnt seem to be all Unreal games. I tried a few other games with the monitoring turned on a couple weeks back and the voltages were not dropping weirdly. So I think the PSU is fine. I was able to run Mind Path to Thalamus way up around  FPS at that time with no dropoffs either. So at this point its only two confirmed Unreal Engine games that have the issue.

7778556,0,t3_4lux0e,GetActorRotation of what? If its always  I highly suspect you try to get the Actor Rotation of your PlayerController which often isnt used at all. Or something along those lines. The Player Character itself will always have a rotation and return the right values. Just make sure its properly possessed if its the default in your game mode that happens by default and you actually use the player character and nothing else accidentally. The dishonored system works with a trace.Im not  sure but the behavior especially the elevator glitch makes me believe they used a sphere trace checked for  angles and used that information where youre looking  the knowledge of whether or not there is a ledge to determine the location.Check for sphere trace by objects or to make it simpler for the beginning try single line trace by objects or just line trace?.The start location is your character the destination is the forward vector of your character multiplied by the maximum distance of your teleport.  CAREFUL! THIS ONLY WORKS FOR FIRST PERSON! IF YOURE CREATING A THIRD PERSON GAME USE YOUR CAMERA INSTEAD OF YOUR PLAYER CHARACTERAs result you get a Hit Result. You can break it to get things like location angle what type of actor youre looking at etc.Now that you have the location teleport the player there and youre done!From here on theres a few things you wanna take care off.. Make sure to teleport the player not exactly to the hit location but rather a few steps before that.. Add checks to make sure theres enough space to stand.. Add fancy markers animations and whatever else you need.I hope that gets you started at least.,unrealengine,d3qcvxs,2,t5_2x11n

By that I mean do you know the sorts of things you want to make and can realistically achieve alone? If you do then grab Unity fire it up and go to work on your hello world project which is sort of traditional of any first step in a new language or system. You wont be amazed by the results but from there all other things come.As a hint new project d or d it doesnt matter youll only use the console in this example. create an empty gameobject in the default scene leave everything else alone. create a c class call it anything you like helloworld for example. Open it and modify it like so    using UnityEngine    using System.Collections    public class helloworld MonoBehaviour            void Update                                 void Start                         Debug.Loghello world!                   Save it attach the script to the empty game object you crated in the scene run it and observe the debug console.

8642118,0,t1_d6lv6uk,For the clients point of view you can spawn a projectile visually if youd like and have the particle emitter for the hit graphic once client detects a collision locally.Thats all fine.Having it immediately cause a force and expecting all clients to accurately simulate the player affected being pushed exactly the same on all screens is your problem.What I explained to you involves clientsided physics you dont seem to understand that. My solution makes it so clients will end up with the exact same result on their screen which is what you want and it will also make the clients simulate physics completely locally after the server gives them the right info.Oh and you dont have to do it for the player that does this they can do it immediately without waiting for a server RPC just make the server snapshot it for other clients so other clients simulate it exactly as you saw it on your screen.,unrealengine,d6lvhsx,1,t5_2x11n
8670240,0,t1_d6p9moq,Competitive games usually involve low latency in the first place. Players at a competitive level expect to play with a good latency.Like I said you can increase the update rate on the projectile and see if that makes it feel better.Oh and you could make a system that makes clients fire off projectiles so they see them instantly but have those only act as a visual representation projectile model hit decal etc. but still have the server do all the work behind the scenes with its own projectiles. That should make it so players dont even notice a difference with the projectile lag and cover most bases. But it involves creating a whole subsystem and dealing with server spawning actors when the clients have their own projectile actors too.,unrealengine,d6pefk3,1,t5_2x11n
8684666,0,t3_4yxpw1,Hi there also old Blender user. Best way to learn UE IMHO is to pick some content examples which are usually keep somewhat uptodate with the released engine version in particular this one is a good starting point and can be downloaded from the UE marketplacelauncher.  Clone that template and make a new project click on all the meshes in the scene and examine the materials! Youll soon get a feel for the material system  it has a lot in common with Cycles and a lot of differences too. Couple of things that can help with interiors like these  they are heavily reliant on baked lighting and reflection map to get the kind of results you see in that demo especially with reflections on things so you might want to spend some time getting to grips with Lightmass its a beast  recent versions of UE added a light portals feature which helps with getting better lighting through openings doorswindows etc similar to how light portals work in Cycles.  look up IES light profiles and how to import them to UE its easy and looks cool.,unrealengine,d6r7jko,1,t5_2x11n

8775282,0,t3_505ivj,You ran Setup.bat and UEPrereqSetupx.exe??Its been a while since Ive done any development with Unreal Tournament but according to this documentation they require that you build the UnrealSwarm.sln Agent project before building the engine UE.sln.  Have you done that? Based on your post the fact that you unchecked the ClickOnce manifest option within the UE project Im assuming that you have skipped this step... so Id recommend going back and following the documentation step by step. Only after building the swarm agent should you Generate Project Files on the UT project.But assuming you actually have successfully built the Agent project in UnrealSwarm.sln and you are still getting errors...You must build ShaderCompileWorker before you build the engine your project or open the editor. You also must do the same for UnrealLightmass and youll need to do UnrealFrontend if you package any content for distribution.Be sure to run Visual Studio as administrator.Be sure that none of your files are set to Read Only and be sure that you actually do have permission to access them. Maybe take ownership of them if youre unsure and check Full Control on their permissions configuration.Ensure that you recreate any precompiled header data by deleting the following directories from your project folders Intermediate DerivedDataCache SavedAfter deleting these directories you should Regenerate Project Files and rebuild the project.You might also try using the Clean and Rebuild options from within Visual Studio.,unrealengine,d72ksx0,1,t5_2x11n

9664372,0,t3_5dfhjr,Setting objects to movable isnt fixing anything. By default its just not baking lighting. Unless you intend this interior to be moving around it shouldnt be set to movable as it can be a huge performance hit. For best lighting results you want to bake lighting. You have to fix the UVs. The best results is creating those yourself in the UV editor of a d package. However you can open the mesh in UE gt Build Settings gt check the Generate Lightmap UVs and click Apply Changes to automatically generate those. Its not the best but works. You can preview by clicking the UV icon in the top bar and then select UV Channel  or whatever it ends up being in the drop down.In the Static Mesh Settings theres Light Map Resolution. You can increase this for better results but youll run into another issue of large areas as a single mesh have that single lightmap as a hard limit. Its often worth the hassle to break the mesh up for a room such as floor wall ceiling etc. to allow for more control.From there getting your lighting right is learning more about lighting and post processing. Once you dont have overlappnig UVs your room will look completely different as itll be baking correctly.,unrealengine,da4c3xl,3,t5_2x11n

Ive just been bouncing between different forum posts and video tutorials.  I need a starttofinish project course to hopefully give me a solid platform to learn more.  It seems like every time I have an idea and I try to figure out how to implement it everything becomes so complicated I lose my place completely.  Its like trying to solve a linear algebra equation without understanding the number line and integers.

10754012,0,t1_ddorsvf,A few things Id look at to start if I were doing this double check the lightmap resolution Unreal has in the second UV channel  at first glance this looks like it could be a lower resolution lightmap compared to the rest of the mesh. If you made your own UVs in your modelling program for the lightmap channel reimport the mesh and uncheck generate lightmap UVs  double check that the vertex normals are facing the same way down on the top parts of the mesh  on second glance it almost seems like assuming no UV issues that the vertex normals arent all facing the exact same direction.  third thing to check is make sure any the mesh vertices and UV vertices for that part of the mesh are all welded. I think this is probably the least likely of issues since if the mesh vertices werent welded youd see messed up geometrymaterials less the lighting issues. Fourth definitely give the lighting live stream mentioned earlier a look. Lighting is a huge topic and bad lighting can be a symptom of things outside the engine like UVs geometry errors etc and it goes over most things that can go wrong. ,unrealengine,ddp70ue,1,t5_2x11n

10973379,0,t1_debslh1,The sloshing is doable just need to replace the height check with a proper Which side of an arbitrary plane is this point on? test and then use that for the normal of the top too.Simple ripples should be fairly simple they wont bounce back off the edge of the container but theyll look decent enough.The top plane isnt there youre looking at the DynamicMilkInner material applied to the inside of the bottle.  Think of how a standard normal map can make a flat plane look pitted and grooved this is just a variant where instead I take a fixed vector in world space  Up and convert it to Tangent Space so it can be used as a surface normal suddenly we have a material which no matter what always renders as though its facing upwards.  Think there may actually be a quicker way of doing this by turning off Tangent Space Normals but didnt think of that when I was writing it.It should work with translucent fluids too at least good enough for most game purposes.  Was thinking of getting that working and also making the DynamicMilkInner shader render the glass inside of the bottle too above the liquid.When I look into the sloshing Ill add BP methods to check if a point is aboveonbelow the water plane and to return the point on the plane directly abovebelow.  With that youll be able to build what you need for your particle system.I do indeed have a Vive and would appreciate a copy when youre done.,unrealengine,debu7ps,2,t5_2x11n
