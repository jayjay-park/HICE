10859407,0,t1_de0160x,gtThe problem isnt the price or the DLC. Its that theyre making a DLC while theyre claiming to be working on the base game.Thats how game development works. By the time a game approaches its launch date and is  done there are devs who have already finished their portion of the base game so they begin work on the planned DLC or expansions. This is how CDProjektRED put out a big expansion to The Witcher  only  months after it launched. Working on both at once is commonplace except for studios like Infinity Ward who outsource their DLC to other studios.gtPeople buy into early access on the agreement that their funds will be used to produce the game.This is how literally every game works. If a publisher funds the development that just means they now owe debt to that publisher that they must pay back by selling copies of the game otherwise they lose funding and get shut down. The funding for every gamestudio inevitably comes from the gamers. Its just more transparent with early access.gtIt doesnt matter if the game is  done or  done. Making DLC with funds given to them for the base game is at the very least a shitty move.Except that they arent using the money from the base game to make that DLC. Theyre using the money from the DLC sales.gtIf the game is done release it. Dont keep it in EA so you can ignore bugs and optimization and just cash in on DLC.Ignoring bugs and cashing in on DLC is not a problem exclusive to ARK. What do you think assassins creed unity was? Theres also the fact that theres zero evidence that theyre ignoring bugs seeing as how they update the game regularly and those updates usually dont contain new content. This is a strawman argument.gtIts devs like this that give Early Access a bad name.Wrong. Its devs who abandon their games or rarely update them and keep all the cash they made on their unfinished game who give it a bad name. ARK has more content and polish in its unfinished state than most finished AAA titles do with a  price tag these days.gtSome great games have come out of Early access but if people keep pulling bait and switches like this and straight up lying to their customers no one will want to support even the good EA devs.Bait and switch means to give players something other than what they promised. They promised a dino survival game and they provided it along with a cool DLC. Its honestly preferable because it means you can choose to pay less for the game if you have no interest in that DLC considering the base game is already so big. They could have lumped it all together and charged a standard justifiable  for all of it but instead you have options.       ,REBL,de02kuu,1,t5_2xdn8
