His previous article to this one was about the random spot checks which arent random at all and arent really spot checks. he then criticised BASC for doing a UTurn on a topic their statement has no bearing on whatsoever.He hasnt replied to my email yet asking him where the Police have stated that random spot checks will take place they havent Unannounced Visits ! Random Spot Checks.The analysis in the OP of this thread seems reasonably thorough thought and admits to and explains its own shortcomings where they lack data and have had to extrapolate and why theyve made the analytical choices they have etc so more of that please!,ukguns,clf2ktp,2,t5_2tc9q

2552151,0,t1_cmotpdo,Its a pitty our NRA is so spineless maybe we wouldnt have lost pistols and semi centre fire. All this talk of having sensible or moderate views mean basically allowing the Gov to shit all over shooters thats the reality of the past and thats the reality of the future. When they come for whatever next probably semi shotguns  all this moderate and sensible views will mean absolutely nothing and then when we have nothing left except for a wooden OU we will all be wondering why the public and the state didnt return the favour in being sensible.

Wheres that? For hunting maybe but not target. Itll vary from area to area but for target Id apply for at least rds. All my local dealers sell by the brick . Going in and buying a couple of a boxes at a time on a weekly basis would be a ballache for the shooter and the RFD wont want to break open bricks unless you buy a brick and collect it bit by bit.Even for a single . youd want to maintain a stock of training and competition ammo so  of each would be entirely reasonable.,ukguns,cxgtgrn,1,t5_2tc9q

6668834,0,t1_d08ljzw,gt and in the UK everything is illegal unless an exception is made. a bit sad Thats not even remotely true. We just have some slightly more restrictive laws in place on what is banned.For instance LongBarrelled Pistols. After  it was realised the government didnt ban pistols they banned short firearms. So they developed the Long Arm which is a pistol but with balancing rods added to bring it up to length.It went to court because the Police wouldnt put it on licenses and the Home Office said No its a pistol. The court pointed out they hadnt banned pistols and ruled that these were section compliant.Section  is anything which isnt explicitly banned by section . So its not a banned unless exempt  its a legal unless banned. Our banned list is just a bit longer than in the US.Moreover weve managed to resist stupid dickingaround with laws such as magazine capacity limits banning moderators or the Federal Assault Rifle ban the hilarious notion that a firearm is more lethal because it has a folding stock or a bayonet lug.What gasgasgas says is accurate  our laws are supposed to be commonsense based not all of them are which is to say things which are banned are banned thing which lie in a grey area are legal unless you do something stupid or try to find loopholes to circumvent them in which case you are normally demonstrating illintent.For the purposes of of offensive weapons law distinct from firearms anything can be classified as a weapon if its used as such. Punching you would be assault. Sticking a biro through your throat would be assault with a weapon. But you couldnt arrest me for walking down the street with a biro in my pocket unless you could demonstrate intent.No one cares if you have a plasmalauncher in a lab as part of some experiment like say a fusion reactor. Conversely if you go out with a flamethrower blowing fire in the street youre going to spend the night in the local custody suite.,ukguns,d0945ac,2,t5_2tc9q
6682854,1,t1_d0ai2p1,God no and i say that as someone who owns both pistols and semi auto center fire rifles and lives somewhere that has more relaxed laws than several US states. Nothing petrifies me more than the near freeforall system the US has existing here. The Americans can bang on about freedom all they like though few realise that a constitutionally protected right to bear arms is one that they share only with Guatemala but limiting the ownership and use of firearms to those members of society who can be trusted to own and use them sensibly is not a limitation on freedom in my book precisely the opposite.,ukguns,d0akddn,0,t5_2tc9q
6700675,0,t1_d0c0obo,The reality is with guns or anything else you DONT get around it.  When some previously law abiding person wakes up nutty one day and decides to kill a bunch of people there isnt always anything you can do about it.  Even if you managed to eliminate every gun on the planet there will still be fertilizer and diesel fuel or they can drive a truck through a crowded outdoor cafe or dump a bunch of strychnine in a water tank or poison a bunch of Tylenol on the shelves of convenience stores.  You cannot prevent all crime.  All you can do is kill or lock up the bastard afterward.  What we COULD do something about is how often we let dangerous animals out of their cages to go hurt people a SECOND time. Edit  May be extreme but far from unheard of.  Several of the mass shooters in U.S. had no disqualifying problems in their background before they went postal.  ,ukguns,d0ceoxz,1,t5_2tc9q

10812747,0,t1_ddv63sx,No worries. There are certain blogs and facebook groups that you can follow which are primarily political. If you only read those then you would indeed believe the world to be all doom and gloom. Of course it is necessary to be aware of what is going on in that field but there is plenty going on in what is now a growing sport with thousands of Scouts shooting international success minor victories in legislation and regulation etc etc etc. Yes some of them are very small  almost insignificant compared with herculean tasks like getting pistols back. But equally they demonstrate that there is a dialogue between policy makers and our shooting bodies with the former now more willing to listen when the latter come to the table and say This makes no sense can we have a chat about some amendments for everyones benefit.
