6181958,0,t1_cys871n,Didnt have the camber tested but the shop owners said that the skis are probably a size too small for me but they should still do the job just fine. Maybe Ill look further into the camber.. thanks!,xcountryskiing,cysbole,1,t5_2s9a7

7879845,0,t3_4n37lg,Seefeld in Austria  ToblachDobbiaco just south of there in Italy  Goms ValleyGoms ValleyValle de Conches in Switzerland  All three are ones Id recommend. All have vast networks of trails for skate or classic. All offer the chance to ski from town to town on day trips.   All are sublimely beautiful in different ways. Toblach for the tooth like Dolomites and skiing through old railway tunnels. Goms for its wide open gentle trails and Swiss farms. Seefeld for their perfect trails and onion domed churches. Hard to pick a favorite theyre all so different from North American skiing.,xcountryskiing,d41rnog,1,t5_2s9a7
9221399,0,t3_56nuay,here are conditions for Slovak tracks so you can check them during the season  and here you can find locations in one map   Unfortunatelly it is really nonuserfriendly web with no english version but you can maybe google about those places. I usually go to Little Carpathians  close to Bratislava where I  live but I would not recommend that. Somewhere around Banska Bystrica  Kremnica  Donovaly it is way better. Best groomed place in Slovakia is probably in Mengusovce,xcountryskiing,d8kvox7,2,t5_2s9a7
9475258,0,t1_d9gcvd4,If youre a big guy skate skis need to be really stiff so you dont collapse it completely. If a skis camber is too stiff you lose grip too soft and you lose glide,xcountryskiing,d9h138n,1,t5_2s9a7
9983391,0,t3_5ik64q,gt I think its pretty obvious xc is more of a workout overallThat may be true but dont be surprised if you get tired faster than you thought you would because alpine uses some different muscles than youre used to.,xcountryskiing,db8v43j,3,t5_2s9a7

11069668,0,t1_demmwwt,Dunno where youre from presumably Europe? but Cascos glasses arent really brought into the US.  In terms of eyewear only the Spirit models have any wide availability and those are neither especially cheap nor would I really consider them sunglasses.,xcountryskiing,demqiwa,2,t5_2s9a7
