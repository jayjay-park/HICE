I stand by what Ive said about attributes  and will fight tooth and claw if I have to but its better to table that stuff for now and just get the rooms and exits stuff going.Ill split it up in a little while I still have couple hours before I can knock off work.,TheNomic,cgehbso,1,t5_30p12

1354660,0,t1_ciljnls,I believe the Checkin is valid but the minion hiring is not. Since the content is essentially gibberish due to the failed hiring would the CIA not equate to something like urobpancakes CIA in this thread?Reference Materialgt.. CheckIn Actions  A CheckIn Action abbreviated CIA is an action that a player may perform by posting an appropriate declaration as the sole content of a toplevel comment on the current CheckIn post. The particular text of such a declaration will be detailed in the rules defining each type of CIA.gt.. CIA Validity  When a new CheckIn post is created the mod will judge the validity of each CIA declared in the previous CheckIn post and implement the necessary results for each one that is valid. Each CIA in turn will be judged according to the rules in the order they were posted to the CheckIn post  starting from the earliest and proceeding to the most recent as denoted by timestamp. CIAs judged invalid will be ignored. Each valid CIA will have its results implemented before the next CIA is judged.gt. Minion Individuality  Minions have a Minion Type which is a text string no longer than  characters long.gt. Give Me Back My Name  A Minion cannot have the same name as a Player.,TheNomic,cim3iu1,1,t5_30p12

1420742,0,t1_ciu6gq7,I wish you wouldve said something in the staging.  Staging is useful for more than just making sure it fits into the rules its a place to discuss your thoughts and concerns.  I think the biggest advantage of staging is to create a Prop that will garner For votes because youve gathered an informed opinion about the subject.   ,TheNomic,ciud91h,1,t5_30p12

5730247,0,t1_cx4s413,Thanks for posting this.My main concern in addition to what uTazakiTsukuru mentioned is that voting isnt totally clear.  Put to a vote is maybe fairly obvious in person but that can mean anything on here.I think we should start a new ruleset with the online nature of the game in mind which is what my proposal tries to do or start from an existing ruleset made for an online game.My ruleset proposal though not perfect covers the basics of the game in an online setting and is pretty specific about certain things which I think is important when playing an online correspondence game of Nomic where things can be scrutinized.  Is there anything missing in your opinion?  Or anything about those rules that you dislike?,TheNomic,cx7e5o5,1,t5_30p12
6340553,0,t1_czabn45,I agree that players are always free to dismiss whatever they want but I dont see a defensible argument based on the idea that a vote is only intended for the proposals wording at the time of the vote.  The rules dont justify that notion at all.The way the rules are written were voting on whatever this proposal happens to say at the time that it closes.,TheNomic,czacmkg,2,t5_30p12
6345329,0,t1_czavx7i,I thinks its okay as long as the content itself is not tampered with the formatting should be allowed to be changed. Whether two names are on the same line or not doesnt change the information as a username cannot have spaces anyway.,TheNomic,czaw6hy,2,t5_30p12
