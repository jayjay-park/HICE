50202,0,t3_1unyoi,My family owns a flower shop and Ive done a good deal of work there as well so I figure Ill drop in my anecdotal two cents WARNING  I HAVE A LOT TO SAY  businesses will almost always claim to use local florists  and the kicker is they do. Its not like they have a warehouse of flowers around the world where they deliver flowers from. No instead they undercharge you for the flowers promising say a  arrangement. From that subtract a  delivery fee and the commission they take on each order... and now what the florist has to work with now is about . So often these orders get bounced around from florist to florist until someone finally picks it up and throws together something that frankly might not even be worth receiving. Order by phone. Yes online ordering is easier  dont do it. This is where clientflorist miscommunications occur. It takes longer but youll get a better price estimate it helps us form a more personal bond with you and you can get a firsthand account of what is in stock and what is fresh. Flowers are expensive. Be prepared to spend. Theres a comment here that says you get the flowers at a better negotiated price through the big flower chains  that is strictly from the customers perspective. In fact they are not negotiated with local florists at all. Youre paying less but the product will reflect that in some way. A cheaper vase a different stock of flowers cheap filler greens whatever.  Good quality from online orders reflects the quality and competitiveness of the local flower shops not the efficiency of big business in the floral business. For christs sake support your local flower business. It is a dying industry and the big chains are a part of the problem. We operate in a wealthy area and guess what? My mother works  hrs a week for what really amounts to about a minimumwage job. Of course this is because personal rant incoming my mother is a saint who would rather make sure her employees take home something worth working for rather than reap every cent of the business profits but still. Support local florists. Pretty please? Prices vary according to location. A standard dozen roses costs . down in the South. . at my familys location. Easily . in New York. .. in Florida. If youre calling a flower shop in a different location be aware that prices vary. I hate to say it but... the more expensive probably the better. Keep in mind  flowers are a luxury item. They are purchased for aesthetics and beauty not for any sort of utility. A flower shop that operates successfully in an area reflects the population it serves and the quality expected of them. I will say it unabashedly  a flower shop that operates in a wealthy area has a very good idea of the kind of arrangements that may be kitschy and the kind of minimum standard that is pleasing to the eye. This is not because poor people have no sense of aesthetics!!! This is because wealthy people have the money to constantly have the input of personal designers. For them the florist is as much a designer of the aesthetics of their life as is the architect that built hisher house the tailor that fit hisher clothing etc. Florists in these areas from my experience are constantly dealing with a population that have a certain baseline designer aesthetic. If youre looking to really wow somebody  be prepared to spend. A dude came into the store on Valentines Day  years ago handed us a credit card and said something really special around . I wish I had a picture of the arrangement my mother put together. It was absolutely jawdropping. Willow branches standing tall entire stems of orchids drooping from the vase just... spectacular. Seriously. If youre looking for something special you have to be prepared to spend a special amount.No TLDR here. If youre interested in the perspective of an incredibly talented floristbusiness owners son read the whole thing.Anyway. Take it or leave it.Edit Obligatory exclamation for... gold?!

754036,0,t3_22reel,Full house is overpowered as fuck and let me explain why I think that.  Yes it is statistically less likely for you to get a full house than a flush or a straight if you were to be dealt just five cards.  However in reality in holdem at least if youre trying to put together a full house youve already either got two pair or three of a kind.  Already decent enough hands to bet on.  If your going for a straight or a flush and you dont immediately get it on the flop you just have a bunch of useless cards so at that point youre more likely to just say fuck it and give up whereas if you were building a full house you already have at least a decent hand so you keep going.  And with that in mind I when I play hold em with my friends we end up seeing way more full houses than flushes or straights.,everymanshouldknow,cgpzo56,0,t5_2u82c

You could also calculate your own TDEE total daily energy expendature  When you know how many calories you need per day you should add between  and  calories  calories over will gain you  half a pound per week  will gain you a pound and  will gain you  lbs. to your expendature to gain weight. The more weight you gain per time the more muscle youll build  per time but with diminishing returns. The more weight youre gaining per time the larger the percentage of the gains will be fat. The more fat you gain the harder and longer youll have to cut diet for losing the fat. Most people seem to opt for  calories over. You also need to manage your protein intake. The general advice that youll find on any bodybuilding website is to eat g of protein daily per pound of lean body weight. Ive seen studies that indicate that around . g per lb total body weight would get you equal results but theres no down side to eating more protein other than that other than that protein costs more than carbs and fat. Many people will tell you that after a workout youre supposed to eat at least g of protein and g of carbs. many people do this with a protein supplement and some kind of fruit. The evidence of the effectiveness is spotty but there would be no harm in doing it and if it is effective there would be a positive result. So why not do it? As for fat and carbs There are various schools of thought but from what Ive seen the exact ratios arent too important and are mostly a personal preference but you should get some amount of all three every time you eat. I recommend using a calorie tracker like myfitnesspal to keep track of your calories and macronutrients protein carbs and fat because people tend to be horrible at estimating their food.,everymanshouldknow,chs90vl,3,t5_2u82c

Beer is primarily made of  ingredients water malted grain hops yeast. The darkest grain color generally gives the beer color the more sugars that are extracted from grains more grains in general the higher the abv. The yeast is what creates the alcohol does most of the work and gives the beer a character  this is why yeast strains are named after the beer type.

1224395,0,t3_283ixi,uGalacDitka has a pretty good response so I will try not to repeat.  I shave after showering and nice hot water makes a huge difference in shave quality. To help this process I also prep my headfaceneck by scrubbing over with a hot washcloth.   www.dollarshaveclub.com.  USE IT.  The shave butter is PHENOMENAL.  Better than any other product I have ever encountered.  I have tried and used all three levels of razors and currently use the executive.  Mach s are fine but every razor DSC offers is less expensive and just as good if not better in quality.   Like Ditka mentioned I will also prep my razor by running it backwards  the same washcloth I used is what I prefer.   Do not press the razor against your skin!  Let it do the work it was designed to do.  With this in mind I will generally shave with the grain first on face and neck against the grain everywhere else and in missed spots.   Rinsing with cold water supposedly helps close pores and heal up any cuts.  Both of these seem to hold true in my experience.  Lotion definitely.  Lubriderm makes a fantastic in which is very reasonably priced.  DSC just started offering a similar product today is the first time Ive used it.  So far so good.  ,everymanshouldknow,ci7d2io,2,t5_2u82c

You want your girlfriend to put you in a chastity belt for months? Go for it. Have fun. What is very important to me though is if you no longer enjoy something you previously agreed to or asked for does it stop? If you no longer enjoy calling him Master in bed or all the time does he stop telling you to do so? If you no longer want to be solely in charge of chores and go get a job is your partner supportive?

You can improve on saying no to people and maybe other small areas but thats not the point. The point is she treated you poorly and thats awful. The problem is with the red pill is that one of the core tenets of TRP makes women a thing instead of a person. There are good things you can learn about how to hold yourself being more confident etc but I think there are better places than theredpill for that. If you make a person into a thing its a static strategy that objectifies a person. It makes you forget that who youre interacting with is a person rather than a goal.Not only that but reading some things on the red pill legitimately makes me afraid. ,everymanshouldknow,cilqc1g,5,t5_2u82c

If theyre still going to try to manipulate me they are NOT my friend and Im going to choose to distance myself from them because being around that is withering.Same as a physical confrontation... fight for an escape nothing more. Fight only as much as is necessary to end the encounter. In a physical fight you can knock out or disable your enemy. Youre unlikely to do that with words youll just stir up their ire. So fighting back emotionally rarely makes the situation better.Though by all means if you find a way to knock somebody out by making them feel like crap let me know I want to learn that!

There are a ton of other ways to use this square expecially when building hips and valleys.  Because the Hip runs at a deg. angle from the center ridge line to the corner.  The hip value would always run at a   which is  inches of rise over  of run.  which if you put it on that handy little hip line was correct every time.

2974096,0,t1_co5yd1s,I think this is ultimately the biggest source of your issue. I smoked for a few years in college and after I quit my morning congestion almost entirely went away.  What happens is that when you smoke your body produces extra mucus in your nose throat and lungs to help protect it from the heat and particulate that you are inhaling.  When you stop smoking or take a break for a period of time read sleep for a while  your body begins to purge itself of the extra mucus it was producing to protect itself in the first place. Heres a link to a study about mucus production in smokers with bronchitis and another about mucus production from smoking in generaland here I went from smoking to vaping and while I definitely have seen a decrease in my morning purge i know that once I stop vaping altogether I will breathe better than ever. ,everymanshouldknow,co6651l,3,t5_2u82c

They do separate the topics at the end though which is great and definitely go through the symptoms anyone with depression could relate to.Its too bad many people in university abuse the illness to warrant extensionscurvesetc. to get them through schooling.

This results in a kind of hot flash that makes victims of severe hypothermia  who are already confused and disoriented  feel as though theyre burning up so they remove their clothes researchers have concluded.gtParadoxical undressing often occurs immediately before terminal burrowing. The researchers in Germany investigating hypothermia victims noted in their article that the final position in which the bodies were found could only be reached by crawling on all fours or flat on the body resulting in abrasions to the knees elbows etc. This crawling  happened after undressing as there were abrasions to the skin but no damage to the corresponding parts of the removed clothing. ,everymanshouldknow,cpc04b9,47,t5_2u82c

It basically just spins around in there with all the other coffee which can lead to heat in the chamber. Heat is bad for ground coffee it can damage the flavour. Its not impossible to grind the right consistency using a blade grinder. In one of the sources above theres a picture of what your grind should look like with regards to a couple beans. Id say take it super slow pulse the power then take a look at it. Its going to take some practice to know how long it takes to get to the grind you want.

3786906,0,t3_33rs6o,Not currently bald but I did use to shave my head regularly for about three years. I was hooked on it! Theres plenty of great advice online but Id like to describe to you some of my own experiences. Hope this helps!FIRST  Get yourself a dedicated razor just for your head. If youre shaving with any regularity youre gonna get through a lot of razor heads. You can go for a safety razor cut throat or a Headblade. Personally Ive no experience with cut throat razors and while Ive heard great things about Headblades I always found a standard safety razor to be absolutely fine. For me theyre safe easy to use and familiar especially as Id been using them on my face for years. And if theyre good enough for your face theyre good enough for your head!  Just stay clear from cheap nasty razors  theyll tear your scalp up something horrible. I used a Gillette Mach .SECOND  Have a hot shower. Itll soften your hairs and relax the skin on your head. Ive heard some men like to shave whilst they shower and if thats for you great! But personally I found it easier to do it in front of a mirror after Id left the shower.THIRD  Start getting familiar with the grain of your scalp. Feel around your head to find out which direction your hair grows in different areas. Everyone is different but trust me learning the grain of your scalp is the key to having a great shave.FOURTH  Lather up your scalp with your shaving gel foam oil or whatever you feel most comfortable with. Ive heard some men absolutely swear by shaving oil. Me I just lathered up my head with Nivea Sensitive Shave Gel. When your preshaved bonce looks like Sisqos hair you know youre good to go.FIFTH  This is where the fun begins.  PLEASE NOTE  What Im about to discuss are the techniques that I used myself. There seems to be a lot of conflicting advice online that discusses safeefficient head shaving techniques and while my own techniques worked for me I have no doubt there are many other balder wiser men who might disagree with my advice. What follows is purely my humble opinion based on my own experiences  I recommend shaving AGAINST THE GRAIN not with. Now the reason I recommend shaving against the grain is as follows The key to achieving a beautifully smooth head without cutting yourself is by making AS FEW STROKES AS POSSIBLE. The more strokes you make the more you will irritate your scalp. You run the risk of making cuts or at very least leaving nasty looking sore patches. When I first started shaving I followed some of the more safetyconscious guides I read online that said Always follow the grain of your head. Never shave against the grain. Sadly this just didnt work for me. Shaving with the grain left me with numerous patches of unshaved fuzz. I had to shave the same areas repeatedly before I felt smoothness and of course the longer I shaved the more irritated my scalp became. I tried doing a twopart shave once with the grain then a second pass against it but in all honesty I did not find this to be any more economical than one single pass against the grain. Maybe Ive just got weird hair who knows. Either way this is what worked best for me.Imagine your scalp is divided into sections. For me I had six  frontleft  frontright  backleft  backright  left side including left ear and  right side including right ear. Your goal is to shave each section slowly and methodically IN AS FEW STROKES AS POSSIBLE. Do this in a controlled deliberate manner one section at a time. Light yet firm against the grain of your scalp. You really dont have to press the razor into your head to get results. Once its touching your head just keep it going in one direction up and over the contours of your head. Oh and once the razors on your head DO NOT move it sideways or you will cut yourself!Any little lines you miss first time round leave them for now and move on. You can come back to them after youve completed the other sections. This is just the first pass so it doesnt have to be perfect. I would always start my shave by touching the razor just below my hairline at the front of my head and going backwards up and over the centre line of my head until I reached the point just beyond where my hair changes direction. Holding the razor with my right hand I would follow closely with the index and middle fingers of my left hand tracing my fingertips over the line I had just shaved. With this twohanded shaving technique you can easily feel which parts of your head have been done and which have not. This is especially useful for the parts you cant see the back and sides. It takes some getting used to before you can shave yourself purely by touch but believe me it beats having to constantly hold up a mirror to check how done your head is.The front parts are the easiest. Once theyre done move on to the back. Remember be methodical back left half then back right half keep it in sections. And dont forget your neck hair! Move onto the left side of your head. This can be quite tricky especially if your hair shoots off in different directions like mine. If you need to put your whole arm over your head to get the razor pulling in the right direction so be it! It might take a bit of choreography but youll soon find what works best for you. Move on to the right side and repeat. Change hands if you need to or just change your grip  whatever works. And like your mum said dont forget to do behind your ears.Once youve completed your first pass go back and get any bits youve missed. Still against the grain still slowly and carefully. By now you should start to feel smooth skin with your fingers as your bare scalp comes through. Take care of any random fuzzy streaks as best as you can but try not to get too hung up on stubborn patches  its far better to leave one or two little invisible bits of stubble than to have a lobsterred overshaved head. Know your limits Master Wayne.SIXTH  Congratulations! With any luck you have achieved a shiny silky smooth bonce. Throw on some aftershave lotion for sensitive skin and enjoy! Just remember to keep it covered in the sun. Believe me sunburnt scalp is NOT cool. Of course theres the matter of your next shave. Id recommend leaving it a few days before shaving again.  days was about right for me. That was long enough for me to be able to shave again comfortably without irritation. Youll soon know if youre shaving a bit too often. Just be sensible.Anyway this got out of hand quickly. Hope this helps! Feel free to ask any questions.EDIT  words and that.,everymanshouldknow,cqnxr4b,13,t5_2u82c

If it is for special occasions then try to choose slim models that have simple but elegant designs. Try to stick to brands that are known for watch making rater than fashion brands since those usually have better movements and quality. This does not mean fashion brands are bad just that they focus on the exterior design rather than the watch mechanics for example Fosil is a fashion brand and has nice designs and a  year warranty if you like the designs it is an ok watch but most of their watches are not mechanical and some are faux mechanical they look mechanical but require a battery. On the other hand Citizen is know for their watchmaking and the new watches are all eco drive meaning they work using light and do not need a battery. ,everymanshouldknow,ct4ybkq,4,t5_2u82c

5692203,0,t1_cx25wlo,Similar story happened to me and my Girlfriend in Rome. We were both enjoying a nice drink at one of the bars. For those that dont know in a lot of Europe it is very typical for these salesmen to just walk into establishments like restaurants and attempt to sell things. Anyway the gentlemen rudely interrupted my girlfriend and Is conversation and even after I nicely waved him off he continued to be very pushy and adamant I buy a rose to the point where he said come on man dont be douche. At this my girlfriend who had been drinking but is usually the shyest person I know shouts I dont fucking want it! I was stunned as I had never seen her yell like this before but it got the bastards attention and he finally moved on. I have now lived in Italy for  years and I can say as an American it is a very different lifestyle in many many ways. Growing up in the Midwest I was always nice and kind to everyone I met but Italy has changed me. The only way you can get through a city like Rome is by being dick to the salesmen or supposed helpful people. I dont mean you get in shouting matches with them but you have to give a very firm NO and then ignore them at all costs nice guys finish last in a city like Rome. ,everymanshouldknow,cx2o8vd,25,t5_2u82c

6314705,0,t3_42389v,This article presents entrepreneurial depression as a byproduct of the highs and lows inherent in running a brand new business. I have an alternative theory completely ungrounded in research but supported anecdotallyPeople who are existentially depressed may seek distraction from the emptiness of life by trying to change the world as much as possible if only to convince themselves that their existences are meaningful. Entrepreneurship is a wonderful way for a bright young person to both get distracted from emptiness and attempt to fill it. This kind of depression cant be muted by any amount of activity though. Anyone with enough intelligence to face serious existential questions headon will likely deal with the depressing ramifications of such questions forever. The few studies done on the subject show that entrepreneurs tend to be smart and it stands to reason even if there isnt much empirical evidence on the subject that smarter people would be more prone to the kind of existential depression that cant be fixed with pills or exercise. TLDR Maybe entrepreneurs come from a subset of the population that tends toward depression anyway rather than becoming depressed as a byproduct of the entrepreneurial lifestyle.

It may be prudent to let it dry completely before applying. Its not great for beard hair to dry it out but it beats beardruff.Beards are technically kind of gross. Its a lot of surface area right around a bunch of orifices. I would rather have a clean damaged beard than have any facial hygiene problems.And it isnt always a hygiene issue.

But even if it is difficult it is useful to apply probabilistic thinking for a number of reasons.. It stretches your mind to consider a broad range of outcomes. Most people never even consider what might happen if their plans get derailed.. Writing down the likelihood of various scenarios can give you a point of reference to discuss with others.. This example totally glosses over this but it is also important to take the riskiness of any endeavor into consideration. If youre trying to predict a number like what will be my annual income from my new business its less helpful to think of a single number than a distribution. If you expect k its very different to have range of k versus a range of k.,everymanshouldknow,d1nf17g,1,t5_2u82c

The entire idea behind the motion is to impart as little lateral momentum to the object being thrown while maintaining the maximum forward momentum. The entire release motion should be as straight forward as possible with no curves in any direction up down or sideways. Any type of deviation causes loss of forward momentum and unstable flight.

9936047,0,t1_db27wer,Agreed that I wouldnt want to be the one one the receiving end of the legal system when Ive fought so long to catch them at it.That chase was the only time Ive done something like that though I have approached loitering vehicles and calmly questioned them after the littering and vandalism incidents every time they would leave in a civilized manner though the situation is still ongoing and likely involves individuals Ive already approached. I think what influenced me to chase them was when me and my brother went to toilet paper this girls house and before we even threw a roll her brother ran outside like a lunatic and chased after us we ran in shock though we had a laugh about it but we didnt try another attempt. I do feel like they are doing it for the lolz but Ive gone months without giving them such reactions even when they tossed the football at my car and retreated into their friends garage I simply looked towards the house and knew they were there one of their cars had their headlights on in broad daylight and some of them were in the car looking at me they came out shortly after I went back inside and start throwing the ball again as if to bait me back out. I really had two choices at that point confront them and try to make a scene in front of the neighbors parents and friends in a character assassination attempt or give them no reaction which I chose the latter. Stuff continued to happened regardless.Thats unfortunate that they were able to commit such damage towards you and not receive legal repercussions video evidence is seemingly a necessary tool to defend oneself in todays civilized age.,everymanshouldknow,db2oxl8,1,t5_2u82c

Noone ever got seriously injured even though there was a lot of fighting. Everyone understood that once you were on the ground you had lost and it was time to walk away in shame.One particularly unpopular kid got into his position after a fight where he got back up and hit the winner in the back of the head at which point he had the whole crowd against him and the winner of the fight was telling people to stop kicking him.

I was in a rush to find examples and those are just a couple of quick ones I thought of. One as a backpacker the bear one and the camp fire one seemed helpful to me... the sinking car one is pretty inexcusable.. And yes I do agree with you that ideas such as Cognitive Dissonance and Fundamental Attrition Error do have their place in the tool box of what men should know. There is no denying that. Perhaps this sub has become something of a catchall. A mix of rgetmotivated and rLPT. Maybe its not the content posters that are the problem rather the sub doesnt know what its own identity is. Honestly Im not the best person to start figuring out whats the best thing to do. Nor do I want to be. I just felt that the content that we have now versus the content we used to see even just a few months ago have become so different that it has become increasingly frustrating to comb through the good and the bad. ,everymanshouldknow,dcygwhi,4,t5_2u82c
