2977302,0,t3_2ua2fw,Well its all together for better or worse.   Had a few clear hours tonight so decided to put things through their paces a bit.A few thoughts on things. The quality of the SVs machining and craftsmanship makes old people like me shed a tear. The feathertouch focuser is everything its cracked up to be...and more.  Cant say Im thrilled with the business side of Starlight but the product is first rate all the way. Cant count how many times Ive been told wood cant be used for an AP pier.  Blow me. I havent noticed nearly the difference Id expected between the nm and nm Ha filters.  The Astrodon is clearly higher quality and has eliminated the halos my old Orion produced...but Ive not seen many if any of the other ofttouted benefits of the narrower bandwidth.  This may well simply be my complete inability to notice such things...Im pretty hamfisted when it comes to things like that. Overall Im tickled to death and will enjoy this scope for a long time I think. Acquisition Details Stellarvue SVST on a Losmandy G mount w Gemini  all sitting atop my new pier.

3175752,0,t1_coqlk8u,basically youre matching the brightness levels of both images so that when you combine youre not overwhelmed with chrominance or luminance.  Overwhelming with chrominance can lead to luminance noise and overwhelming with luminance can lead to chrominance noise as you continue processing if you dont linear fit.,Spaceonly,cor5z2e,1,t5_330q4

Whats your graph look like?  whats your capture software?Beautiful image I wouldnt change a thing.  I think its got the right balance of noise background and signal.  great job!,Spaceonly,cpaelid,1,t5_330q4

3995499,0,t3_368m6w,This is a rather old image that I never posted. It was the last one for the season for me from the UoG observatory. Captured on March th  from the University of Guelph Observatory. Celestron C Edge HD mounted on an Astrophysics GTO . Nikon D ISO . Approximately x  second exposures. I used shorter exposures because this object was rather bright and I wanted to get good detail on the middle of the nebula. The telescope was decently sharp on this particular night. Unfortunately I think that it couldve done better with a collimation before image capture but we were running an event for the club so we didnt have time. Processing was pretty easy as it usually is with planetary nebula. Im pretty happy with how it came out although I think I could do better in the future with a sharper OTA. ,Spaceonly,crbpxr9,2,t5_330q4

4719830,0,t1_ctom4fd,Not as much progress today as I had one more piece to glue... Heres the insulating layer now glued to the backside of the secondary heater.  Also shown is  of  strips of copper tape on one of the veins the second is on the other side.  These thin conductors will keep a very low profile for routing power to the secondary heater preventing the wonky diffraction spikes that would otherwise be present if I tried to route wires along the vein.  Wires from the heater will be soldered to the inner side and wires soldered to the other side will be used for attachment to the controller.Now I need to wait for a few parts to arrive to button this thing up  One maybe two panel mount jacks will be installed to the OTA for easy heater connection so that I dont have wires dangling from the thing in storage.,Spaceonly,ctph27c,1,t5_330q4
4746807,0,t3_3fvvc6,Personally I love the framing here.  Im a big fan of different takes on popular objects and really like the opposition of Big galaxy vs Little galaxies.  Kudos there.I also think you did a nice job of controlling what was probably some fairly high noise without turning things into a smudged oil painting.  Again kudos.I cant immediately decide if the softness could be improved by focus or if were just talking about a soft perhaps miscollimated? SCT here.  Ill leave that discussion to those more knowledgeable about such things.Hard to be sure since we dont have the uncropped image but...gt ..minimal field curvature..Looks an awful lot like field rotation to me rather than field curvature.  Again...would be much easier to be sure if we could see the uncropped original if youd be willing to share.All in all a winner of an image imo.  Thats NOT an easy rig to carry on that mount especially long enough to get fainter stuff like this out of slow objects.  A nice attempt at an enjoyably framed image for my money.,Spaceonly,ctsvowb,1,t5_330q4
5188742,0,t3_3m2adn,My first guess is that frost developed on the chip at that spot. It usually shows up at the edges first. As soon as it appears again take the camera out while still on and examine the chip frost is pretty easy to spot.,Spaceonly,cvbfmda,1,t5_330q4

8256085,0,t3_4sb7f5,Its a terrific image of a rarely or never seen nebula. This is  rock solid imaging. Congratulations. Like Eor said any complaint I have is purely subjective your image is technically impeccable.I dont actually have a complaint just a personal preference the version I saw in chat didnt have quite as much star reduction or whatever youve changed on the stars. I think the stars in the field have an interesting variety of color brightness and distribution and all those things were much more up front in the prior edit. For me the interplay between the bright nebula faint nebula dark areas and the stars are a lot more subdued in this image making the bright nebula a standout by itself. Its a calmer image in comparison if that makes any sense.Also like Eor mentioned the brightest parts being stretched I agree that perhaps youve pegged the red so to speak and as an alternative to stretching to the end you let the brightest bits of the nebula to exist a tiny bit on the blue and green channels like we discussed in chat. But in his immortal words but again purely subjective and Im probably full of shit.    uEorEquis ,Spaceonly,d59kflq,2,t5_330q4
