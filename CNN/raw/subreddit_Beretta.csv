8471110,0,t1_d60d8nb,Thanks for the heads up was wondering about if i needed to do anything before discharging a few rounds. Just a few dollars over  with tax ammo and cleaning kit.,Beretta,d60fgfu,2,t5_2uoie
9688220,0,t1_da6paye,Yeah For one its nice to have a trigger made out of metal rather than polymer but it did help a bit. I later added WCs trigger bar that comes with this but just be warned that the part is blued so it looks a bit odd on my gun which has the Brunition finish which I believe is a type of epoxyparkerizing combo. Ditto for the WC mag release I linked in the post about my first few upgrades above as well as the little mag guide that replaces the plastic mainspring housing retainer plug with that dumb lanyard loop. But all this is moot if your pistol is blued. Oh and if youre trying to achieve a better trigger pull i.e. lighter and less gritty the short action trigger and the Ultimate Action Tune Kit the package with the trigger bar go really well with this thing it replaces the normal trigger return spring which is insanely hard to install if you take it out so thats an added bonus of the WC part. If you get one and find that you feel a little grit just relieve a teeny tiny bit of metal on both sides of the body of the part the thing with the hole where the trigger bar crosspin goes with some grit sandpaper and then bring it up to a mirror polish with some grit sandpaper. I rented a stock M at the range just to remind myself how much better my gun is now with those few changes and I would definitely recommend it to you. Short of either messing with the searhammer engagement which I wouldnt mess with unless youre a gunsmith or trying to make a reduced power sear spring like Mosin Virus did I think thats your best move for a significantly improved trigger pull. Good luck man!EDIT sorry my whole point in bringing up that action tune kit with the trigger bar and the trigger conversion unit was to say that they both seem to do their best work when they are used with the Wilson short reach trigger so keep that in mind too.,Beretta,da7a16i,3,t5_2uoie
10238115,0,t1_dc425ne,I do have the overgrip on. I had a hogue grip on my fs and it feels like the . The thin grip isnt bad just doesnt feel as good as the fat one.,Beretta,dc4jpxt,1,t5_2uoie

11047222,0,t1_dek27nv,I carry a full size beretta or CZ  during the winter. The trick to carrying full size is dressing around gun good hybrid holster and a belt designed for ccw. If you use a normal belt your pants will sag and it will be uncomfortable. Tejas Alien gear comp tac and . make great ccw belts just to name a few.,Beretta,dek6m8e,2,t5_2uoie
11515632,0,t3_62l5xs,You know how the  is inherently more accurate because the open slide design allows the barral to only need the tiniest range of movement to facilitate the locking action? Well the PX attempts to retain this level of inherent accuracy while adding the advantages of a closed slide by implementing a rotating barrel. The PXs rotating barrel stays trained on the target as it rotates in place so you dont have the barrel tilting upwards and affecting accuracy. Also as mentioned below the rotatation is supposed to absorb some of the recoil. So in short the PX should be able to perform on the same level as typical striker fired polymer framed guns low bore axis advantage but with the advantage of a DASA system and manual safety. That said the slide mounted safety is harder for me to disengage than it is for me on the  for some reason. ,Beretta,dg1ar3b,2,t5_2uoie
