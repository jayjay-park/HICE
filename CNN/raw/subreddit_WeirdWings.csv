6982166,0,t3_4bb4d2,This would probably be much more feasible now with modern software similar to the tail landing rockets going around.  It might be safer than the  rotor V even given counterrotating props are an allornothing arrangement.  If you lose power youd at least retain control in the glide.,WeirdWings,d17rn4o,3,t5_35fvr

11584922,0,t1_dg95e2a,Not diametrically but the single blade generates a forward pulling force offset from the axis of the plane and engine. That produces a bending moment in the shaft and a cyclic vibration on the airframe. With a twoblade prop the shaft is only in tension since both ends of the prop pull symmetrically.,WeirdWings,dg95p2o,6,t5_35fvr
