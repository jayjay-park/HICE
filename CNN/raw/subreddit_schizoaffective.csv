So that was good. I been painting or drawing every day not really happy stuff but its all real emotion. I asked my doctor to increase my antidepressant she said no.

4032646,0,t1_crfthfl,Well I went off of my antipsychotic right after leaving the hospital not by choice but because the pharmacy couldnt get it to me in time once it got in I had already gone through very intense withdraw symptoms it felt like my hart was going to pop it was beating so fast. Once off of it I was okay more or less so with my doctors approval I discontinued it completely. I kept on lithium and a mild antianxiety for a while but my emergency medical coverage eventually ran out and I was doing fine so I figured I would see how it goes. I was quite put off by the changing cocktail of drugs and fucked up way they interacted with my actual symptoms. Now I was at full tilt when I was in the hospital so I understand why they just wanted to drop a bunch of drugs on me but honestly a little counciling instead of directed questions intended to funneling me into a diagnosis would have calmed me down a lot. Once I finally had a single moment where I felt safe and could rest my brain started healing itself. I really havent had much problem until recent stresses combined with reaching out about this condition triggered a small resurgence of symptoms. I dont know if I should post this because I dont want to encourage experimentation but I have a medical marijuana card and one of my canaries in the mine is how THC effects me lately its been more like it was when I was afflicted so I decided to get some super low THC high CBD marijuana. It is suppose to have antipsychotic effects. I noticed an improvement in clarity and a reduction in mania. Only down side is I get tired but that could be from being a little manic for a few days.,schizoaffective,crfyayz,2,t5_2sfb8

4164662,0,t3_38g8kg,Hi  Ive been diagnosed schizoaffective. Started experiencing paranoia and some delusional thinking in my preteens and started with depression and anxiety symptoms around . At  I started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. Prescribed  antidepressant and  antipsychotic at first and these got switched around over the years new medications added dosages increased side effects that felt impossible and me occasionally stopping certain meds and restarting. I was taking so many pills for a while barely into adulthood and it felt like they sucked away my personality and who I was. A few years ago around age  maybe? I decided I wanted to simplify the medication regimen cut out the medications under supervision of my psychiatrist until only the most effective ones remained. It took a few years and I did it slowly especially after past experiences of withdrawal symptoms and relapse. A little over a year ago I decided I wanted to get off my antipsychotic medication completely. I sought a therapist with experience with psychosis and told him my intention from the start. I then worked with my psychiatrist to slowly taper off the medication watching for return of any symptoms that might indicate needing to slow down the rate of tapering. A few months later I took the last antipsychotic medication to date now  or  months.I was never fully symptomfree while on the medications but fairly functional at times. Id still have paranoid thoughts intrude into my brain and hear things at times but when the meds were at their best these symptoms felt less intrusive than before as if faded into the background in my brain and a little less bothersome though still present. While tapering down and then since Ive been off the meds over the past year and  months Ive been practicing other ways of managing the same symptoms. Ive experienced my symptoms for so many years that when they emerge I can recognize them for what they are usually pretty quickly. Knowing that they werent real or rational hasnt really helped in the past from keeping them from becoming severe and me becoming dysfunctional. What Ive been doing over the past year or so when I notice the same old thoughtsexperiencesfears pop up is  practice responding to them differently. I try best not to try to get rid of the symptoms hush the thoughts or fight them away I also try not to spend time assessing each paranoid thought each sound etc to determine how real each threat is looking for supporting evidence or trying to make sense out of these experiences. Both of those things always seemed to make my symptoms worse over time. What I found helped me was to notice the symptoms when they popped up and then let them be without fighting to get rid of them but also not paying lots of attention to them. Turning my attention towards the psychotic symptoms allowed them to grow and feel more disabling. I try not to feed the symptoms with my attention anymore.I notice when they are there and I move forward to whatever my plans for the day were and work towards my goals. Id say that my level of symptoms for the past few months is equivalent and sometimes better than symptoms when meds were at their best. BUT now without side effects fear of future med complications and I feel my personality and creativity return that felt so blunted by medications. All to say getting off meds can be done successfully AND at least for me it needed to be done carefully. Stopping dosages suddenly has made me feel more symptomatic than before ever starting treatment in the past. Going slowly watching myself carefully having support mental health professional or otherwise were crucial. Be cautious and take good care of yourself. ,schizoaffective,cruzb5e,2,t5_2sfb8

4545304,0,t1_ct2xtc3,I think I got it situated but after being off abilify for a while and suffering withdrawals its hard for me to want to go back on them again.

4798494,0,t1_ctz9in6,I Tried Abilify for  weeks.  It was the worst three weeks of my life.  I completely stopped sleeping.  I was maybe getting an hour or two a night for three weeks.  It gave me to much energy and racing thoughts which made my psychosis much worse.I know some people like it but for me it was hell.Im now on lamictal for a mood stabilizer and I have never been better in my life.  The only problem is that it keeps me up at night so I have to take tamazapam to sleep.  Im also on respiridone and xanax as needed.  I was officially diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder after  years of an initial diagnosis of bipolar.,schizoaffective,ctze108,1,t5_2sfb8

5454676,0,t1_cw8pvb6,gt I now know that my delusions are just that  delusions though it is still very hard to draw a line between the disease and meThese beliefs are so deeply ingrained and such a knee jerk reaction for me still.  It seems like I cant even know what is real and what is delusion until I ask someone.Im so sorry you see everyone as an enemy too when you are off medication.  I know what this feels like it is so scary and makes me feel crazy and fragile and exhausting to keep my guard up all the time like a scared bunny in a field of wolves hiding behind tall grass.  I hate this feeling and I know its not real but it doesnt matter knowing it does not stop the delusions.I want to get on medication even temporarily just to see what its like to have peace.Thank you so much for reading my entry and for your response.  I have never told anyone about how I feel not even my therapist until this past week. I thought it was normal.  I feel so much better to know that someone else can identify.  Thank you thank you.,schizoaffective,cw8vxkx,2,t5_2sfb8

9132148,0,t3_55cn26,Hey!Im a bit like you in that I have hypnagogic auditory hallucinations which cause me a lot of stress because I misinterpret them to be evidence for my delusions. Delusions being due to psychosis and auditory hallucinations being hypnagogicWhen I was at my worst I had horrible bowl movements pains everywhere strange bodily illusions where my hands and legs would feel numb and not there etcI think its normal when you get stressed out for your physical health to be impacted. I cant remember what chemical it is exactly but theres some chemical that gets produced with stress that can effect you physically and often physical symptoms and somatic complaints are seen in those with major mental illness.I find that physical symptoms can make you worry more so try not to worry about them just mention them to your doctor so that they know to what degree your mental state is affecting you.,schizoaffective,d89kd7a,3,t5_2sfb8

Its not what its intended for. And side effects. Not worth it. When I am in my mixed episodes I have safe music that I listen. It is calming music and not sad or upbeat. Just chilled.

Theres also the time I woke up in the Hospital ER being stun gunned by  other people. The funny thing is I couldnt feel the stun guns I actually grabbed the stun part of the stun gun and nothing happened. They finally found a weakness on my inner thigh and I stopped lol. Sometimes we forget what we did when we were psychotic and other times I think we act out of aggression because we wake up in an unfamiliar environment.
