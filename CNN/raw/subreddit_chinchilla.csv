1730807,0,t1_cjwjvux,I had to create an account to respond to this. I have no obligation to defend the owners but I hate to see them so misrepresented by PETA. I purchased a chinchilla from them a few years ago and all the animals there were well cared for and not neglected.  All comments from previous customersvisitorsvolunteers of the ranch will reflect this sentiment as well. The owners of the ranch taught me everything I know about raising and caring for my chinchilla. They were always willing to provide help and answer questions for no personal gain. Also the humane society said that there was no evidence of mistreatment. I hope all these chins find a good home and apologize for the ramble. Included quotes and source below.Kelli Schry a spokeswoman of the humane society said she was aware of the electrocution claim but humane society officers visiting the farm did not find any evidence of mistreatment.All seemed to be in good health and good behavioral health she said.check out the comments for more testimonials.,chinchilla,cjxbzsj,6,t5_2s30d

4412219,0,t1_csmy1l5,Okay. Im glad you have let that one slide but Im going to point out these militant tactics are only going to lead to people seeking out an alternative community. It will make new people fear posting pics and questions because they will see attacks in other comments rather than information. Yes we all get sick of saying go to the vet  times a week But as responsible owners dont you think its in our best interest the entire hobbies best interest to inform in a manner that will get the point across better? Breed discussion like we had on what you meant by backyard breeders instead of forcing a person to shut down shut up and shamefully retreat?Do you know why I have never posted a picture of my chinchilla to here? Because Im  convinced I will get critizism. Most of that is on me just being silly. But... these last few days? To say the least they havent made me more willing to share pictures here.Im not accusing you of banning anyone Im not accusing you of being a bad owner of the subreddit. I just want to see this subreddit and our hobby grow. The reptile hobby is SWAMPED with misinformation disreputable breeders feeders and everything. And we have to help people across a wide range of species figure out humidities and substrates for desert lizards tropical geckos hell today I was helping a guy figure out how you would feed a captive thorny devil. Those lizards that eat ants and only ants. You dont by the way. You need several colonies of ants just for one lizard. Its impractical unless thats your thing. But I didnt tell him to not buy it. I just told him everything that went into it.  My point being that we can be like this too! There are other ways to get people on the right path. We just have to do it. And for all you random people reading this as well that goes for you too. We are all in this together. We CAN change this hobby and the way people look at it. For better and for worse.

Panicking makes figuring situations out even more difficult. Staying calm will help your little buddy relax too. Heres what jumped out at me  while separating your chinchillas you mentioned grabbing his tail. You may know already that chinchilla tails are incredibly fragile and not a good place to grip. Can you check out your little buddys tail?

5019052,0,t1_cuqz0ty,I appreciate your input. The ultimate goal is for me to get ahold of a ferret nation or similar cage but Im trying to do the best with what I have now. I probably will replace the plastic ledges eventually but for now I covered them with fleece to diminish chewing on it. As for chewing what you cant really see in the picture is a lava brick and several wooden toys that she regularly goes to town on. Ill be sure to look into a cuttlebone. I also make sure that she ALWAYS has timothy hay available. As for her teeth I have looked at them from time to time and they appear orangish like you said they should which is good. Whenever she was my sisters chin she was not tame at all to the point where you really couldnt even touch her. I slowly got her acclimated to me and now she is very friendly especially with me will come up to you and I can even pick her up and hold her. Thanks again for the suggestions Ill be sure to look into them.,chinchilla,cuqzjao,4,t5_2s30d

Try putting her cage in a corner if you havent already.  They feel safer that way.You should never chase a chin. Theyre Prey animals.  Youre only going to scare her more. If youre having trouble catching her try using a net or something to reduce stress and accidental harm.Ive been in your situation before.

6331326,0,t3_42clon,Despite what pet stores say they can NOT have a lot of things the pet stores sell. They say it is chin safe when it really is not good for them. Most of the treats and feed are terrible at pet stores. No fruits no veggies no nuts no seeds no sugar no salt. Safe treats include rose hips and a plain cheerio every other day. They can also have plain mini shredded wheat. I would read everything to the right. There are many links and good tips. Click the topic you want to know more about.  Chins need a dust bath twice a week. Blue cloud or blue sparkle dust. Reverse osmosis water is best for them to drink so they do not get parasites. They need unlimited fresh timothy hay and a good pellet such as oxbow mazuri or Tradition.  tablespoons of fresh food everyday. They need apple sticks or other safe wood to chew constantly. There are many wood vendors you can find online to buy from in the links to the right.  They sleep mostly during the day. They should not get wet. ,chinchilla,cz9aw2h,7,t5_2s30d

7593893,0,t1_d35ca53,I just want to remind you that normally people have to work during daytime and chins are active during evening and night. Yes they are sometimes awake during day but it should not be decisive that I can play with them during daytime. So to say you should not own a chin because you cannot play with them during daytime is quite unfair. Cats and dogs are awake during day and sleeping at night so when someone is not at home they likely notice this more than chins. They are waking up when we am coming home from work so I believe a chin is a better pet for someone who is workingEdit and she is living with her boyfriend so there are  persons to take care of the chins.

9142754,0,t3_55ijte,How about ridiculous in an Im amazed they didnt die way?So we had Zeus and Chico sharing a cage for a week while we waited for her new one to come in. She was spayed at this point so we werent concerned about her sharing a cage with Zeus. Zeus had one of those Snak Shak logs that he loved to sleep in.We also had our friends dog staying with us at the time. He was a huge Belgian shepherd who also was police trained. He had strict obedience training too so if you didnt know he had the police training you would think he was just an aloof family dog. He only went into police mode if he work gear was on. His name was RingoOne night while we had them sharing the cage I guess they were playing too hard. They had knocked the log off the shelf and directly into the door flinging it open. Zeus and Chico being curious little shits escape the confines of their cage and out into the wild blue yonder that was the living room. Ringo also slept in the living room. Now my father hunts and we would occasionally feed Ringo fresh wild game. He would usually get squirrels or rabbits. We now had two rodents on the loose in the house with a dog that would totally eat said rodents. I went downstairs to get ready for school and their cage which I could see from the landing of the stairs was wide open. I freak out and immediately look for Ringo. I find him sleep by one of the end tables in the living room. I wake him up and he seemed WAY too cheerful. Preparing for the worst I look at him and ask where are they. He then sticks his nose under the end table.There were Zeus and Chico completely unharmed under the end table. The table was in a corner and against my couches that sit flush to the floor. He had cornered the chinchillas under the table for me. I grabbed Chico but Zeus got away and Ringo ran after him. I got Chico in the cage and Ringo came up to me with Zeus in his mouth. I put my hands out and he plopped Zeus down again unharmed. They were both returned to the cage in perfect conditionHe somehow understood on his own that they werent for eating. He was even smart enough to make it easy for me to put them away properly. This happened  years ago and Im still dumbfounded about it to this day. We now attach everything to the cages to make sure any midnight escapes never happen again. ,chinchilla,d8awr8i,10,t5_2s30d
