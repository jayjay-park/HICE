5705711,0,t3_3t8cgb,The giant map is not tedious and you can be at the point of training at round  onwards. It takes about  mins to get to the pack a punch and after that you can shoot zombies to your hearts content. In shadows of evil as long as you get juggling and staminup you can train in the first area for ages before you need to go into the rift. Its really not that difficult to have fun. Once you have jugg and a gun off the wallbox you can shoot zombies if you want to. Dont get mad at the people that want to unlock cool rewards and exciting storylines.,blackops3zombies,cx4ckjm,1,t5_37rgw
