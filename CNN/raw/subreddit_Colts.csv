104599,0,t1_ceqan0v,Its not fair because its obvious the problem isnt him hes constantly ordered to run up the middle where hes hit almost as hes taking the ball from Luck.

104783,0,t3_1vaitd,At first he seemed a little lost which is to be expected. As soon as he started to look comfortable his injury happened. He came back into the rotation slowly but you could see that his comfort level had greatly increased. He began picking up the run much easier and got some decent pressure on the pass. I think he will grow in the offseason but will still split snaps with Walden. I expect a  sack season next year and I would be happy with that. He has the potential to be a very solid all around player. I dont think he will be dominant in any phase but he wont be a one trick pony.

With one injury youd be missing a punter AND a kicker and teams can tell you this year the amount of talent in the free agency and its not good. Plus it would be kind of unsafe for him to continuously kick punts AND field goals because of the differences in form.

Year after year some guy throws up  reps and then proceeds to impress everyone in the weight room and no one on the field. Same with the test.

We are only in year  of the regime and Ive seen a lot of people ready to jump ship if we lose. If it was that easy to start from scratch and build a super bowl contender then no team would ever be terrible.

I should also note that Phil Simms during a live broadcast a of a Packers game that when they did the pregame interview with Aaron Rodgers that he said he likes to overinflate the balls above the NFL regulations.

Are you that badly unaware of your flaws?gtInsubordination and not cheating. Okay... if by insubordination you mean that when the league specifically said you cant do something because it is against the rules and then you do it anyways that is insubordination and not cheating sureThe punishment was insubordination.  Reading comprehension seems lost here.gtWere not stupid. Well..not being able to differentiate between cheating and insubordination is pretty revealing. They are not mutually inclusive things.gtHeres the thing now. Its no longer one instance of cheating. Your team cheats.None of this has been proven. The Patriots have yet to be proven to be cheaters in this instance or any others. You are grasping at straws to emphasize a poorly concocted argument based off of a very little information yet to even be confirmed by the NFL.gtYou can call them insubordinatesNo..their actions during  had them punished for insubordination. Do you even realize what you are typing or do you just put a bunch of words down in hopes nobody bothers to question it?gtEveryone outside of the delusional Patriots fan base knows what they are Cheaters.Only delusional people who have no ability to form a cognizant argument can just repeat a word or accusation dozens of times in hopes that it sticks.

Clearly we can see that it has moved toward a more offensive minded atmosphere as all the big penalties award the offense in a major way.  The NFL has all this money they do things to promote safety on the field and yet everything takes away from that hard nosed game that we fell in love with as kids.  The Legion of Boom and a few others around the league still give you those John Lynch style hits but they are few and far between.  Hell even Pat McAfee will lay the wood from time to time.Im saying they should invest in equipment to help protect players rather than diminish one side of the game to promote safety.  Also I think all helmet to helmet hits should be reviewed before a penalty is solidified on the field.  Call it on the field wait for NY to give the yes or no.

And with our secondary being lessthanstellar and Brady being Tom Fucking Brady After a Scandal ft. Gronk wed need everyone healed and at full strength.

The Cowboys really disrupted the Pats offense early in a way I hadnt seen in a while and even though they couldnt sustain it all game I think they showed Bradys not immune to pressure especially from the edge nowadays and Gronk isnt totally uncoverable.

We heard this many times about Erik Walden weve heard this many times when early contract details come out.  Then the dust settles players settle in player contract details get looked at a bit harder.  And knowing this and how the salary cap looks and player pool is shaping up well know over the next two years how his salary cap system will pan out.  But as of now his FA contracts rookie contracts and salary cap management has looked fantastic.  I mean really when we got Vontae Davis locked up with a contract we initially overpaid then literally the next day we see other top CB contracts several million over Vontaes contract and guarantees.  Its moves like that and not moves like Laron Landry that make a huge impact.FA misses happen all the time.

6275921,0,t1_cz2zeuz,The Cowboys have if not the best OL in the league then one of the best. They have three firstround picks starting and a guy who would have been a firstround pick if not for an unfortunate legal incident which he wasnt responsible for. Tony Romo got decapitated twice this year.By contrast the Patriots havent drafted an OL in the first round since  and Brady stays upright. And that firstround pick of theirs is on IR. Theyre starting midround picks and UDFAs and flourishing because their coaches have developed their players better and because Brady has an incredibly quick release. Sacks are as much on the QB holding the ball for too long as they are on the OL. Possibly more. You could basically subtitle Tom Bradys autobiography Three Seconds or Less.Drafting OL high is not a panacea and does not guarantee your quarterbacks survival. Spending high picks on guards and centers is a great way to end up without gamechanging talent at far more premium positions.I really dont want to see elite QBs carve up our defense for another two years.

8584818,0,t1_d6els57,I agree with Reox plus just for the record before the suspension and injury he had . but that was  year old Mathis who had that this is  year old Mathis. There is a difference. I am not trying to down him at all I am a fan of his but Vontae is the answer here by a rather long way for me. Langford was very good last season and so was Anderson before the injury. Mewhort played well TY played pretty good. But if for no other reason the the absolutely lack of depth at corner for the colts Vontae is the answer. If Mathis gets hurt it will hurt we need more pass rushers badly but you can blitz and do some other things. If Vontae goes down we are just straight fucked. Now I mean we still have to see how Patterson plays and maybe he will help with that but in todays nfl you need more than  good corner just like you need more than  good pass rusher. The colts can get decent pass rush from blitzing and Langford and Anderson and other ways. As for last year there was nothing behind or beside Vontae in the corner area.,Colts,d6eotpt,1,t5_2r6es

Basing off of how we did last year we should be on track to  right now. But Paganos coaching has regressed hardcore. Firing Pep didnt matter because Chud still uses Paganos preferred schemes. Grigson is improving imo but him trying to take the blame off himself is hurting his image. And now I think Pagano is slowly losing the locker room. ,Colts,d8jo0jh,8,t5_2r6es

9222571,0,t3_56o0m7,First half OL was nice and similar to the Lions and Chargers games. The two sacks were coverage sacks where Luck had time to make it through his reads but no one was open. Second half that all changed. They stopped the no huddle and that added pressure onto the line. Good and Haeg got whooped time after time on stunts. I wish we had some continuity there right now but with knocks and rookies its not happening. Three things leading to OL issues are having rookies make mistakes WRs not getting open enough Luck holding ball to long. Luck only seemed to hold a couple balls too long today. WRs struggled a few times as well which lead to sack. RGRT not having played together enough to work together and provide propert protection.,Colts,d8l11ha,2,t5_2r6es

9261265,0,t3_5784um,People will do whatever mental gymnastics they need to in downplaying this. I continually see Nate Dunlevy and others bring up that Peyton Manning was a top player by year  according to DVOA. This is so intellectually bankrupt its mindboggling.DVOA is a great stat. But its relative to what everybody else is doing. When Manning entered the league a bunch of guys were on their way out. And those guys werent Brady Manning or Breeslevel anyhow. Theres an exception like Warner but some of the other guys up there with Manning early in his career are Gannons and Garcias. Luck has entered the league at a time when there were multiple Hall of Famers putting up some of the statistically most impressive seasons ever. After the  locks for HOF you have Big Ben Romo Matt Ryan and Rogers who have at some point or another absolute been crushing numbers. If Manning entered the league at the same time as Luck regardless of what team he was on he probably wouldnt be a top  player either. The only real exception is Russell Wilson and I wont go down that road except to say that I think hed struggle as much as Luck given the shitshow that the Colts have been.You can go into team strength but what is more overlooked is the absolute lack of consistency Lucks had. Its Browns level of mismanagement. Manning had  years of Tom Moore and one system basically with a core group of players for a large portion of it. Luck in season  is on his rd OC and his th offense Pep season  and  were different enough imo with some of the same receivers but not even a solid base personnel package except TY is in. ,Colts,d8pxki6,14,t5_2r6es

He will probably take a goddamn receiver.When I heard him spout that bullshit about not being able to field a competitive defense with Lucks salary my opinion of him was finally solidified.Then he has the balls to say we need to be patient and it will take time to build a defense through the draft.

9330388,0,t1_d8yoayy,The thing is he addressed the line.  He made mistakes in the past.  He acknowledged them.  And apparently at least in some fashion Polian gave him a pass on it.Only thing I can say is he at least did something this time around to protect Luck.  And based on the way contracts work we should have those  guys for  seasons so long as they are worth keeping.  Now he likely gets some more flexibility and can resume BPA or whatever were calling it.As for Freeman there very well may be more to it than that.  If it was simply a pride thing then he absolutely screwed the pooch but no one besides Freeman and Grigson really knows the truth.And as for our pass rush Id simply say that nothing weve done there has really been astounding.  Mathis is in the twilight stage Cole didnt do what theyd hoped Walden is servicable and playing some decent ball and then we have two rookies in Maggitt and Bates.  Weve gotten good pass rushers in later rounds ala Robert Mathis.  I suspect they invest heavily in the LB corps next year.At this point I could still see it either way.  Were about another draft away from being decent and one more draft from being good.  If he makes the right moves along the way we will be a solid team.  Or if someone else does...,Colts,d8yp0sl,1,t5_2r6es

9353631,0,t3_58i8wg,Lets talk about the way the world is and not how it should be necessarilyIts the old headachesTalent issue. If Andrew Luck said Death to America and laid down during the national anthem we probably wouldnt cut him. If Vontae kneeled in protest we wouldnt cut him. When Cromartie first kneeled we didnt cut him. When other guys got healthy and he played poorly against the Jaguars he might have been benched if he never protested but keeping a backup corner around who creates even a little bit of arguably negative media attention... The Colts thought he was expendable. Because thats the thing its possible that his poor play AND his protesting got him cut.

9356234,0,t1_d91w19s,I dont care if its a free pass.  I care when someone is so disconnected from reality that they dont even realize its a free pass then get upset when they they dont get that free pass that most people would never get in the first place even though they probably got it.I mean take a step back and look at the situation.  Here is a player who almost certainly got released because he wasnt doing great at his job not because of protests.  Because Irsay is at least smart enough to know that if he actually fired Cromartie over it thered be a shit storm.  But his wife blames his being released solely on the protests.  Which by the way he was doing on national television while wearing a Colts uniform.  Not during his own press conference.  Not on his own time.  During a game televised because of the efforts of the team and the organization of which Cromartie is a part.  In other words the exact sort of thing that would get most people fired.  But again it didnt get him fired.  Maybe there was some bias and Irsay was more easily swayed by his performance on field because of it.  But its just disingenuous to say that he was fired because of it while completely overlooking his lack of onfield performance which was clearly the biggest factor here.TLDR. So heres the problem someone is complaining that they didnt get to do something that basically nobody else gets to do you can maybe make an argument that they should but that overlooks the reality of daytoday life for most people even though they did get to do that thing that nobody else gets to do and thats just ridiculous and completely out of touch with reality.

9367427,0,t3_58urlm,Fire Pagano keep Grigson. Sure Grigson hasnt been great and the team probably has as many holes as it did when he took over but at least he has brought in some good players whether its trading free agency or the draft who have contributed to the team. Pagano hasnt really improved as a coach at all. When he came in he said that we were going to run the ball and stop the run. That hasnt happened at any point under his command weve had  games with a  yard rusher and Im honestly trying to forget when Jonas Gray ran for  yards and  TDs against us. Also as a defensive minded coach our defense has sucked the entire time.So to me it seems like Pagano has failed at his job many times and Grigson while mostly bad has at least done his job well a few times. Plus I also think that you could have the best GM and roster in the whole of football but any random guy at coach you probably wouldnt win many games.,Colts,d93dzqr,14,t5_2r6es

Go on rnfl even now and youll see it and its been that way since his rookie season. Dig through some threads from . We made a mistake not taking RG. Lucks ceiling isnt that high he just has a decently high floor.People were legitimately still on there after year  saying he was going to bust out of the league and getting dozens of upvotes. People still call him a turnover machine even though he has at worst a league average int  over his career. People were ready to anoint RG when I was calmly trying to point out that regardless of his injury issues his absurd rookie stats were a smoke and mirror show of short easy completions and a great run game. Youd get downvoted into oblivion for saying something like that. Its obviously true now. Theyll anoint anybody. Foles. Carr. Wentz.

10058668,0,t1_dbijn73,The problem is that our starter who is good enough is . We have to have a guy that can continue at the same level Gore is whenever Gore either retires or being a  year old running back in the NFL kills him. He cant continue forever we have to have a backup plan and as much as I like Turbin hes probably not going to carry the load. If Gore hangs it up after this season weve got to make a move and the good news is we can target a guy in the th rounds that will have the ability to do so. Backs arent truly a dime a dozen its been a long time since Indy has had a good one and its shown. The offense is better with a good back. Its true that good backs can be found later but good QBs can too its just harder to find. So I agree we probably shouldnt use a high pick  on a back this year we should see how the draft is falling and if a guy is there that could carry the load we take a chance on him. Were going to end up with a th round comp pick for Fleener so well have an extra pick to use.  ,Colts,dbio339,4,t5_2r6es

If someone is going to argue we dont have talent than the only other option for us to win that many games is that we must have great coaching which I dont really agree with. Maybe its a mix of both?

Offense isnt really our issue we were th scoring in the league and the oline could possibly be patched with a veteran or two if our current guys arent panning out...defense is historically bad for the Colts franchise. We need to hit on a few of these st round picks on defense and get a game changer on that side of the ball immediately and thats hard to do outside of the st round.

Advancing to the playoffs is legitimately in reach in .  We absolutely cannot go backwards.  I would also say that we absolutely cannot enter the playoffs and get stomped on like we have in the past.  We have to win or at least put up a solid effort against a solid opponent to have the appearance of being a competent team with a competent head coach.TLDR  Its put up or shut up time for Chuck.

The ONLY problem I see with that is that even above average pass rushers seem to be getting paid serious money in FA regardless of how limited their past production is.I still say that if we dont have the defensive player there that truly fits that need Cook or Fournette can make a LOT of sense.  Take pressure off Luck take pressure off the receivers and we could likely stand to improve our time of possession.

For some reason Ive always valued RBs that looked smooth and slid through contact running between the tackles because in my mind if they are slippery in there and smoothly shed arm tackles I feel like they will be more durable through their career.  This could be completely wrong and definitely not technical terms .  But just giving my thoughts between the two I would be happy with either later round.

11467984,0,t3_63ozld,Ill write some general notes out because Im lazy and dont want to type out a lot but Ill still try and stay informative like I usually am. EDGE probably isnt our biggest need anymore with signings at OLB such as Barkevious Mingo John Simon and Jabaal Sheard. I would expect a pick dedicated to EDGE though but it doesnt necessarily need to be first round. With the release of Patrick Robinson our CB corp is the most obvious weakest link with an immense drop off in talent from Vontae Davis to whoever is our CB. Along with that we are also in need of a dedicated slot CB so we should look at guys like Jourdan Lewis or the popular Corn Elder I like Lewis more personally. There is one good LB set to go in each of the first three rounds Reuben Foster st Raekwon McMillan nd Anthony Walker Jr. rd. Any one of these guys would be an upgrade at ILB but my personal ranking has Walker over McMillan as Walker has more potential at a coverage LB which we need to compliment Pound Cake. Ballard and Irsay have made a few things clear our OLine is not set for the future we are looking to trade down in the first and possibly any other pick and BPA will dictate our picks rather than need. This essentially means that we will take a lineman in this draft at some point probably earlier than anticipated and Ballard isnt going to be stuck on team needs. Whatever that implies its still something. No word on RB position from what I can tell.Thats pretty much it in laymans terms.,Colts,dfvw1iv,5,t5_2r6es

Texans were  above average QB away from having a real shot of reaching the SB last year with the defense they had. Watson has all them makings of an above average NFL QB so I would assume that if the Texans defense doesnt have a drastic drop off then they should be set up to make another legit SB push. I am glad the reports are stating that Watson is not the started day  I do not believe that. They traded up for a QB because Tom Savage is their started Watson will start day  if he can grasp the playbook at all.
