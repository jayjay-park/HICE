1243923,0,t1_ci9jbzb,It used to be you could watch classic car prices balloon directly after a widely televised bigbucks auction. People see these idiotic selling prices and decide thats the value of the cars.Now the damn things are on TV all year long and were stuck with these ridiculously inflated values that only seem to increase every year.Theres a guy in my area asking K for a rusted out  charger with no motor tranny or interior. Just a rotted shell.Or Mustangs! Theres a metric shittonne of Mustangs. Used to be a good cheap car to get into classics with. Not anymore.Camaros? Dont even think about it.,mopar,ci9k2f3,5,t5_2sehf

1303043,0,t1_cig495e,I havent touched anything on the carb I put on  so maybe thats the problem. When we bought the car the seller have us an extra reman carb and I just put it on.   It did however shift a few times. I also read I might need to adjust the bands. ,mopar,cig7iwy,1,t5_2sehf
1756398,0,t1_ck0jkko,Definitely an interesting way to approach a project.A  isnt bad in those categories and itd be able to push a bigger car if youre set on... well pretty much anything other than an abody.They seem to be more abundant than s as well. Blew your motor up? Look for a dodge truck or van lates into the s thats been rear ended.Though I might be a bit biased. haha,mopar,ck0jv7t,2,t5_2sehf

4358666,0,t3_3ax1al,Its a charger. Year one amd metal classic industries. Pretty much anywhere. If you are looking for mechanical pretty much any auto parts store. What are you looking for?,mopar,csgydl8,2,t5_2sehf

5189022,0,t1_cvbgbgr,Well I know both muscle car and x suspension pretty well. What I was thinking of and still am is an IFS lift somehow applied to a muscle car IFS system. Those aarms or controls arms are still stupidly short and would be at a steep angle with very little lift and would be stiff as hell. They would probably break on his first bump. So that entire front suspension system will need to be custom made with new mounting points for the aarmscontrol arms and everything.,mopar,cvbgucj,2,t5_2sehf
5444087,0,t1_cw6vyyd,Thanks for the advice! I definitely plan on taking my time and making sure I do it right.

5453418,0,t1_cw8b1v4,VERY bad advice. Pan bolts must all be torqued to the same spec or the may can leak. I have found more often then not they are lightly torqued like  to  lbs ,mopar,cw8q5kh,3,t5_2sehf

7508967,0,t3_4f7xc1,Hey sorry for the late reply. I have a  SRT that Ive had for roughly a year or so. It was also mostly stock just intake and lowered. As it sits it has k miles on it. Its been a great car and I love it. All of the issues were induced by previous owners and they really werent too major or hard to fix. Parts are pretty cheap usually. ,mopar,d2vqcon,1,t5_2sehf
8370751,0,t1_d5nukhm,I never thought of that. I spent  months teaching myself to plastic weld on old chev x grilles before attacking my grille. Now word has gotten out locally that I can plastic weld and I get bugged to redo all sorts of muscle car ABS and I am no way comfortable doing that. I would hate to screw up some one elses  of a kind piece. ,mopar,d5nw6wi,2,t5_2sehf

10498031,0,t1_dcy23av,as long as theres a decent amount of coverage by the snow on the road all I need to do is plant my foot. The  rear bias makes it handle more like a RWD car anyway. This is not the current system as my car is an  this is a fixed ratio setup always in AWD.,mopar,dcy298k,1,t5_2sehf
