5124761,0,t1_cv3iohf,I dont know if this will be helpful but my opinion as a user granted as one that has tried to stay out of the drama up to now is that he is a good guy trying to do his best.  Hes not the problem.The thing is the other side isnt the problem either.  The various issues  selfdetermination banning problem users communication breakdowns efficiency joke subs privacy free speech complex rule sets etc etc  none of those are the problem either.  Nor is the problem a combination of all of those factors.  The problem at this point is the sheer mutual antagonism that has built up over the last year.  As someone on the outside it seems to me that both sides are composed of wellmeaning people who are now essentially traumatized.  Both sides respond with a kneejerk defensiveness.  Both sides distrust the other and assume worst intentions.  Every tiny slight brings up the memory of infuriating unresolved threads in the past.  Both sides are emotionally entrenched not because of the what they would be compromising but because of who they would be compromising with. Its like rChristianity really needs to see a good couples counselor.But most couples dont each have a fringe contingent of ... highly emotional .... friends who lurk into all of their conversations and mass downvote everything the other team says.Honestly I just think we need a break from it.  Both sides need to try to get to the place that they dont see other users as the enemy.  Both sides need to give a little bit both sides need to admit that theyre a little wrong.  And the first step is both sides need to recognize when theyre in an unwinnable fight and walk away from it.  ,ChristianityMeta,cv3q58m,9,t5_39p1l

5154983,0,t1_cv7cwmy,right so they disagree with the church but consider Catholics good people and good Christians which is hardly hostile and exactly what Id expect to hear from the reformed crowd about Catholics. compare that with r.christaintiy heres a sample of the posts I linked in OP on seeing an example of a post making fun of the bible gt If thats the worst thing that happens at rChristianity today then Id say it was a pretty good day for them.anothergtHad a similar experience recently when I voiced the Biblical doctrine of election on the question how do I become a Christian? A flurry of downvotes followed not to my surprise.Election by the way is mainstream theology also accepted by Catholics its not just a reformed thing and another gtrChristianity is filled with secular Christians many American Christians that either dont attend church or attend seeker sensitive at best churches that have been feeding them milk all their lives. There is very little theology and many want to look like the World. I have given up trying to inject Scripture into their discussions because many just block their ears and gnash their teeth. Especially when it comes to dealing with sin issues.and another gtIve found it best to think of it as a sub about Christianity but not at all a Christian sub. Indeed I usually get more comments from atheists and other unbelievers when I post there.and another gtits very discouraging.gtI love this sub. I also created rProtestant because I couldnt mention anything remotely theologicallysound in rChristianity without being waylaid by someone CatholicOrthodox.and another gtrChristianity is the new rDebateAChristianand thats just one sub and that aint even all of itif that seems the same to you then you have a problem if you think they are compalining about your liberalism then you have a problem.  ,ChristianityMeta,cv7d8yx,-5,t5_39p1l

See my use of meta threads as an example of something I have done as a suggestiongtas well as silly rabbit trails about things like whether or not a mod did or didnt coach a userExcept it might still be going on to a degree.gtIt would just be an echo chamber here. No mod would really answer our questions anymore.It might be worth it. Also there is always the mothersub. I would post there but I bet I would be called a trouble maker.gtI stand by the principles I set aside for the state of post as a start anyhow.But that is you talking not the mods.,ChristianityMeta,d0dg8r8,1,t5_39p1l
6755833,0,t1_d0e60kj,From the metagt If your conversation has gotten to the point that you demand someone answer your question there is a good chance that you guys are getting to the kind we would rather happen elsewhere and we may prune it. I think that sorta established the precedent here. That said its terribly vague and awkwardly worded. I think retooling the metarules is necessary in a lot of cases. ,ChristianityMeta,d0i3yk4,2,t5_39p1l

9422073,0,t1_d9aayos,I havent had a problem with your scripture quotes or your discussion questions aside from today and the one with cussing last week.  The core of your intellectual engagement is great its the feasts and saints and martyrs stuff that Ive been taking issue with.  I know Ive been getting downvoted to oblivion  with these posts because Im being a brat or whiny or whatever but I dont think Im crossing a line when it comes to the overall tone of the community because its beginning to feel like this isnt a place for low churchgoers.  ,ChristianityMeta,d9ab9n9,2,t5_39p1l

11012330,0,t3_5x1m5n,The bottom line with Mormons and JWs is that while many Christians think that members of these denominations are in grave error are heretical are nonChristian or are even are nonChristian cults and while some moderators may feel the same subreddit policy is that we remain neutral on these issues and allow Mormons and JWs to express their theology and we afford them protections from attacks similar to those afforded to members of other denominations.gt protectedYoure all protected to pretty good extent from nonChristians ...gt I can think of no doctrine more central to Christianity than the idea that Jesus is God. Except that I cant make that claim without violating rule . and implying that someone is not a Christian.... but you are less wellprotected from each other. You can point out that other Christian subscribers are in error in threads if they say something that you think is in error but please dont unload your whole laundry list whenever you see someone with those flairs say something that doesnt pertain to anything on your list.If the subject is whether or not Mormons or JWs are Christian you are welcome to say no but you may not dismiss someones arguments on the basis that the person making them is not Christian.    A Are Mormons Christian?    B No.B is not going to get busted but A might get downvoted depending upon how boring his actual question is.    A What do Christians think about ltsubjectgt.    B As a Mormon I assert ltargumentgt.    C Your argument has no value because you are a Mormon and therefore nonChristian.C is going to get busted.    A As a Mormon I assert ltargumentgt.    B Interesting.    C Dont listen to A because Mormons arent Christian.C is going to get busted.    A What do Christians think about ltsubjectgt.    B As a Mormon I assert ltargumentgt.    C I disagree with your argument for ltreasonsgt.    C I disagree with your argument which is out of line with mainline Christianity which asserts ltargumentgt.C is not going to get busted for either reply.Your mileage may vary but if you get busted or not busted contrary to the above send us a mod mail and youll get to witness an interesting conversation among mods.,ChristianityMeta,deg7tdt,6,t5_39p1l
