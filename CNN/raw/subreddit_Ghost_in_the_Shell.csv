986120,0,t3_25eep0,The reason that  merged with Motoko was explained by  but not especially clearly since the conversation goes on to other subjects and philosophypoliticsetc.The basic idea is that  became self aware at some point. However Ghost in the Shell well  at least is arguing that self awareness is not synonymous with being alive. One major part of a living creature that  was missing was the ability to reproduce. The reason reproduction is important is because it preserves some of the data DNA in our case of each parent. Offspring can use the data from each parent to evolveadapt. This is essential to living beings because as the environment changes our response and way of living must also change to be able to survive. Motoko says this to Togusa in the bus at one point overspecialization leads to the death of an organism therefore adaptation and bringing in new and different ways of thinking is essential to the longevity of an organismspecies wanted to merge with Motoko in order to bear children into the net. The children are neither  nor are they Motoko but something of a combination of both. In other words  wanted to merge with Motoko in order to be alive. I hope this helps. EDIT a major theme of GitS is What does it mean to be alive? What does it mean to be human? Because if you can just swap physical body parts around if you can manipulate memories what is a human? I personally think that GitS is saying that being human is being able to relate to other humans and combine our data knowledge and way of thinking to continue humanity. Its pretty convoluted but the basic idea as I see it is if Motoko is fully a cyborg is she human? I would say yes. Is  human? Well he was missing the ability to pass on his information but once he merged with Motoko he fulfilled the requirement and became human.,Ghost_in_the_Shell,chgdoct,22,t5_2t38b

10111413,0,t3_5kov1u,The handwritten note by Sanders that is in the previews also reads that the realization is that she is Motoko I am Motoko which I assume means it is at the end of Act . Does this mean that she finds out she is Motoko Kusanagi part way through does the movie comment on its own race changing?. All super unlikely but there we go.  EditI also actually find the previews worrying because Ghost in the Shell has never seemed to be a Who am I? story that is very western too  very individualist. I find that the Buddhist ideas the Puppet Master says at the end of the  movie and the Puppeteer in SACSSS and at the end of the manga are usually the strongest qualities in that the self is always changing and defined more by what happens to around it than what it is at its core or in the past that these things even change memory changing.It is a bit worrying to see that his starting point may have been an old fashioned who am I government is evil plot line as even the government parts were always more tangled than that as in section  is still public security and fights to remain separate often failing.  ,Ghost_in_the_Shell,dbpizav,16,t5_2t38b

I think it may be just about as popular which is most people into anime know it thats a big group and a lot of film buffs know it another big group but neither are the mainstream but plenty of movies are made for buffs and fans instead of mainstream and still do pretty well  I think of Warcraft just see the gap in fans to the critics and the fans on meta  Also we need to remember that the world contains a lot more than the Americas  all of Europe which could also watch Ghost in the Shell and many US movies are big in Asia.

11050130,0,t1_dekh161,The music has always been important to Ghost in the Shell it has always been important in everything. It has usually been about taking from different places and melding the old with the new  the juxtaposition of a foreign traditional music piece with the cyborg creation visuals or the traditional Japanese lyrics with the Bulgarian style are the fusion of different parts that represent the movies key theme  the instability of things that seem stable essentially the elements that exist in the world coming together and making something new. Hell the lyrics are about two things unifying in marriage  it is all chosen very meticulously and seriously. You can make this argument for this track as well unfortunately I dont like that it seems to be similar dubstep parts that I have heard before connected to the old theme only by fading out the dubstep and letting the original track just play  seems to miss the point of fusion and only represents two things existing at the same time both trying desperately to stay distinct. The very idea that the Puppet Master tells Motoko she needs to let go of. Or you know the other interpretation  music has no meaning or significance and we should just be happy it sounds cool. Edit also it was Kenji Kawai who did the music that wanted the Bulgarian stuff but ended up using a Japanese traditional choir he had used before  which was then pair suitably with their style another fusion  ,Ghost_in_the_Shell,dekihct,8,t5_2t38b

11460460,0,t1_dfurp9z,As a fan of the original movie and film lover in general it wasnt a good movie to me. But it wasnt a terrible movie either. If you are a fan of the original go see it. There a lot of things you can appreciate as a fan of GitS if you go in with a low expectation even though the movie isnt that great. If you do go in with any sort of expectation I think the some of the changes they made many of the missed opportunities especially in some of the important scenes and finally the lack of subtlety will likely leave bad taste in your mouth. But dont take my or anyone elses word for it. Go see it for yourself and decide. All forms of media is subjective and subject to different opinions. One should hold their judgement until one experience it first hand.I do think refreshing on GitS  in particular before viewing is a good idea if you havent seen it for awhile.,Ghost_in_the_Shell,dfv1app,5,t5_2t38b

11529883,0,t3_64hube,I appreciate for what it is as a GitS fan. My expectation wasnt high to begin with due to couple of factors such as director and writer. And the fact that it wasnt very Hollywood source material in the first place. But as a film lover it doesnt make any where near top movies either. I cant help but to feel underwhelmed by its weak points. If there is a silver lining here it couldve been much worse and at least it wasnt as bad as some of the horrible gameanime adaptation of the past. And my biggest satisfaction is their ability to recreate anime style sequences without feeling corny. I look forward to other adaptation with possibly better directors and writers.,Ghost_in_the_Shell,dg2wx7h,6,t5_2t38b

11778641,0,t3_67vark,For me the scene seemed to be a commentary again on what defines the line between human and machine. From the girls or perhaps more accurately Volkersons perspective the dolls were a tool they used to expose the plot and ultimately save the captured children. Batous anger stems from the fact that this line of thinking completely ignores the idea that the dolls albeit unnatural have a life of their own. It hearkened back to the conversation Batou and Togusa had with Haraway regarding the act of the dolls committing suicide. Togusa immediately questions whether a robot can actually commit suicide but as we find out later the act of ghost dubbing actually gives them a fragment of a soul making them a living thing. Regardless of this however the dolls still must obey commandsprogramming and thus at the end of the film the ship is filled with dead dolls which Batou struggles to accept as an equal price to pay for the lives of a few children. Ultimately I think their anger isnt necessarily directed at a child but rather their frustration with the situation and society in general that allows this sort of thing to happen. Perhaps its precisely because Batou himself has become so mechanical and the Major has ceased to even have a human form that others wanton disregard for that which is unhuman causes them such strife. My two cents anyway. ,Ghost_in_the_Shell,dgv5a46,5,t5_2t38b
