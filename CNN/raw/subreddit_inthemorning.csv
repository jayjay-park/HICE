2332268,0,t1_clzyq9a,gtThere are numerous criminals that flee. We throw up our hands and say oh well. There are several obvious reasons why high profile cases might be prioritized particularly cases where a celebrity is able to commit a crime with no punishment.  If you want to take the most negative interpretations while ignoring any slightly positive ones you may do so.  Then we have reality which is usually in the middle.gtTheir goal for notoriety caused it though and they ignored the impact to the girl. That is my point they arent doing this for her or future victims. This is about their own power and fame. They arent about justice or societal good. They are about themselves and votes. If they need to pretend to care they will do that. If they need righteous indignation for votes they will have it.You are assuming goals and motives for them based on your own prejudices.  The real world is not black and white.  Some people involved may be motivated by fame and some may not.  Some may not care about the girl while some may have just weighed their priorities differently than you.  If you feel that the victims feelings trump all then your qualm is with the law which says that criminal cases can proceed without consent from the victim.  However there is one thing which is black and white about this case.  It is  illegal to drug and rape a  year old girl and it is  illegal to plead guilty than flee the country.  Everything else we have discussed is opinion and conjecture.,inthemorning,clzzcf7,1,t5_2s0if

Im sure a few people wrote them about it.  It really does nothing but give easy fodder to anyone trying to discredit AC and JCD when they dont fact check positions they take on live broadcast those which are easily verifiable.I think its obvious when you watch the two first person videos that he did indeed pull and point the weapon straight at her then glance at the camera guy and realize that the woman is not in the shot.  He pulls back the weapon and pauses until the camera guy pans back to the interview ongoing.  Then he points and shoots.Full synchronized video of the entire incident here where you can see him point and then pull back and wait.,inthemorning,culwsh3,2,t5_2s0if

9833054,0,t1_dap5fzr,Jesus. They really MUST.Its like if my doctor said I had cancer and needed chemo I have three choices. I can accept an experts opinion. I can get second opinions. Or I can learn medicine and make myself an expert.Option . Trust the expert. There is obviously a risk here but if you are lacking any other evidence your own skepticism is not a valid reason to reject the claim of an expert.Option  Get a second opinion. Preferably one from an expert who doesnt have a financial interest in the conditions that led to your getting cancer in the first place. Or better yet experts from across disciplines in multiple agencies in academia industry and government. Sure there will be an odd expert paid by the tobacco industry that will say that smoking CURES cancer. There will be some quack homeopathic doctor who claims the other  doctors are all hiding the true cure for cancer from you and that you should buy his toilet water. When unrelated experts agree on a subject your skepticism is an extremely poor rebuttal.Option  Become an expert. There is really nothing stopping skeptics from joining NASA or NAOA. In fact scientists are skeptics at heart. Or battling cancer go ahead and learn the peerreviewed treatments. But if your expertise is limited to a Dr. Oz segment in which he tells you raspberry ketones cure cancer maybe you arent qualified to argue with the experts.Yes the media is guilty here. They are guilty of creating a controversy where there is none. It is as if they were saying that the Earth is round is a controversial issue. Sure they could hire the flatEarth expert who pleads to people to keep an open mind but if millions of lives were in the balance that is wholly irresponsible.Global climate change is real. Currently the climate is rising as a result of the burning of fossil fuels. That presents DIFFICULT CHOICES as much of our economy continues to depend on burning fossil fuels. Climate deniers and skeptics rely on the stubbornness of Americans to keep themselves in work. Might we find other solutions to climate change? Almost certainly. If the consequences of climate change are as bad as scientists predict you can bet that they will be spending much of the next century trying to reverse the effects.There used to be a scare about population growth. It may have been a disaster too had we not made advances in genetic engineering. Our ability to produce food for growing numbers of people has increased. We scienced our way out of it. But relying on new scientific discoveries to get us out of pending catastrophes is not an ideal position.Skepticism about the media is very healthy. But that goes both ways. Indeed the media can dismiss legitimate controversies. But that is not what is happening with global warming. The media is MANUFACTURING controversy where there is none. Its like if Jesus and the Devil appeared on Earth now and Jesus said to love one another our media would have pundits paid by the Devil to undercut that message saying NOT ALL ANGELS AGREE WITH JESUS. And in a way they would be right because the Devil is a fallen angel. I used to enjoy No Agenda but it seems like more and more John and Adam pander to their producers. Every homophobic act by an official is a media stunt. Every school shooting is a false flag. But then they see media reports that align with their producers worldview and they swallow those up whole hog.One thing that used to bother me was Johns sixweek cycle theory about FBI antiterrorism. Yes there seems to be a pattern of the FBI baiting relatively innocent people into terrorist plots the FBI orchestrated. This used to bother me. But someone explained to me that the FBI was acting as a lightning rod in those cases. The FBI infiltrates extremist groups and defuses them before they can grow into terrorist groups. That would be an effective measure against terrorism.Once you selfidentify as a believer in something youre selfworth becomes wrapped up in making sure all cases fit your belief instead of making sure your beliefs fit all cases.The fact that the media creates a controversy out of global warming is neither evidence it exists or not. The evidence is in the scientific community whose peerreviewed findings OVERWHELMINGLY point to the existence of manmade climate change. If you allow media to create a political controversy out of data you ensure that the media can control all narratives.Today we found a mathematician who claims that  plus  equals . More on this controversy after the commercial. That is the media abuse that Adam and John advocate. A consensus made into a controversy by the media is just as dangerous if not more dangerous as a controversy made into a consensus.,inthemorning,dap9opc,5,t5_2s0if
