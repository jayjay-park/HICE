2110364,0,t1_cl7lwe2,Yes thats what Im saying although expected probably was not the best choice of description. Im thinking more along the lines of treating gfycat links special similar to Youtube links and imgur albums. An optimal mode where if its a gfycat video then it loads as a video instead of a webpage. Leaving readability as a default is a must for those using the app on a lower powered and especially lower memory device. As gfycat links become more prevalent it does hurt the user experience.A setting to automatically turn gifs into gfycatvideo would also be cool.,ReddHub,cl82m4b,1,t5_2vaik
