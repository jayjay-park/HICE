11475293,0,t3_63t0x0,China is the opposite of the Seto Kaiba antagonist. China realises that what he was playing for was not what was going to satisfy him. He changes his mindset and becomes far happier.The Seto Kaiba antagonist keeps trying the same thing over and over again without success. Seto Kaiba antagonists include Makishima from Psycho Pass Orochimaru from Naruto though he has success every now and then and Kyubey from Madoka Magica.In fact China who was the initial antagonist ends up drifting away and just becomes a guy who loves to play table tennis no longer anything like an antagonist. He doesnt linger on being angsty for more than he needs to. He knows when to give up.When it comes to Dragon who is the primary antagonist he too does the same thing China does. He knows when hes done and as you stated Peco displays that Dragon no longer fulfills the role of antagonist once he loses.,ThatBoldnessEmpire,dfwpxi9,1,t5_3jvnt
