6309911,0,t1_cz67oeb,A few years ago when he did the whole protest against Nintendo I was thoroughly entertained.He should just put the game development off for a while and get a real job. I hate to say that because it goes against the whole sticking it to the man thing he has going on but its really the best option. With his skills I dont see why he couldnt just get a job in the tech industry and work on the game in his spare time.,bobsgame,cz6v6zq,1,t5_2z999
9333305,0,t3_56prlu,Im not sure. i actually quite like the puzzle game as an avid fan of games of this genre excluding match s And at this point i just want to support the guy himself. like if he offered it i would gladly let him crash at my place and maybe teach me programming as payment. I dont even want him to finish the game just for him to be happy and in a stable place in his life. Thats all.,bobsgame,d8z2c2g,1,t5_2z999
