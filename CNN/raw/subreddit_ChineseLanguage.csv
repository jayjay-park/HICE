Theres a lot to do in the city and I had a great time. Im guessing that your Chinese would improve more in Harbin because it isnt the touristexpat mecca that Beijing is but theres definitely more to do in Beijing.Also of note its ridiculously cold in Harbin. Im from New England and the Beijing winter was the coldest Ive ever been. To make myself feel better I would look at the Harbin weather forecast and be glad that I was at least  degrees warmer. But they also have that ice festival which is supposed to be incredible.

1362036,0,t1_cimzzl0,You definitely dont have to. I just think it looks nicer and I had plans to go to Taiwan where they use Trad. By the way this is imrons method. Extremely simple but takes some time to master. Ive found it by far to be the best way to learn characters. The more you learn the easier this method becomes.gtAnyway here is how I learn characters  Initially I spend a short amount of time analysing the character and breaking it down into its component parts and strokes. I close my eyes and stroke by stroke picture a nice large image of the character being drawn by my minds eye. This I repeat a few times until I can fluidly draw the character stroke by stroke. Still with my eyes closed I draw the character again but instead of going stroke by stroke I go component by component making each component pop instantly into view. e.g. for  the component parts I would break it down into are  and . So first I practice until I can get  to pop into view in my minds eye. This might take a while at first especially for an unfamiliar component and I may need to go over the individual strokes of the component a few times but before long its not difficult to make it pop into view. Then I practice until I can make  pop instantly into view in my minds eye. Once I can do that then I draw the character component by component making each component appear instantly. I just timed myself then and for a character like  I can draw it in my mind maybe  times in about  seconds. Unlike writing a character out by hand though my brain is actively involved in the entire process visualising the character to make it appear which makes the process much more effective than writing the same character out by hand  times. After numerous iterations of that then I practise making it so I can visualise the entire character instantly and once again run through multiple repetitions of having it pop into view in the space of a few seconds. Once it has popped into view I might also take some time to study it more closely holding it in view and going over each aspect of it clearly and vividly in my minds eye and noticing small details such as how the middle stroke of  is slightly shorter than the others by approximately the same height as the top stroke of  and that the height of  is approximately the same height as the height of the rightmost stroke of . All of this can be done in a fraction of a second. While this entire process is going on I will also be visualisingthinking about the meaning. Not some unrelated scene of heads of people shunned by society falling into a river but rather the meaning itself. Most words Im learning now Im learning from context  newspapers novels etc and so typically Ill visualise the scenestoryarticle at the point related to the character.  Likewise for the pronunciation. I dont have a problem of trying to remember which tone it is because I dont think of it as shun fourth tone but rather I think of it as shn  a sound that is completely different from say shn or any other tone combination and Im not likely to mix them up any more than I am likely to mix up shn and chn. In the same way that I know that sh and ch are different sounds despite the only difference being one is aspirated and the other isnt likewise I treat individual tones as completely distinct sounds e.g.  is not just afirsttone but rather it is  a sound at least as distinct from   and  as ch is from sh. It takes some time initially to develop this ability especially if you are not familiar with tonal languages however a small investment learning to do this greatly simplies the whole learning of tones. You can basically stop learning tones because you encode them into the sound that you remember as being correct. I cant emphasize enough that this is a learned ability. It was not something I was good at in the beginning however many hours and thousands of characters later it is now second nature.Anyway that is a slightly more detailed explanation of how I learn a character. It is not just remembering it it is putting in a concentrated amount of effort to remember it. Its also the long version. After having done that for thousands of characters its now essentially reduced to the version in my post above. Visualise the meaning visualise the individual components associate them with the pronunciation and then conduct a large number of repetitions in my mind in a short space of time.  seconds is usually enough to get an unfamiliar character firmly entrenched in my mind and as long as Im coming across the character enough in my readingdaily life it stays there pretty well.I want to emphasize that being able to visualize characters like this is a completely learned ability. At the beginning I couldnt do it that well and it was nowhere near as efficient and fast as it is for me now but like everything with practice it becomes easier and easier.Thats the system I have in place and I find it works wonderfully. No need to come up with stories unrelated to the character no need to associate the pronunciation with an English word that doesnt really sound like the Chinese pronunciation SHUNNED WHO etc and I only spend time remembering things related to the character itself. Even better the more I learn the better I get at doing it and the simpler and easier it becomes and no problems with jumbling up with HalfLife  and Final Fantasy. ,ChineseLanguage,cin0rb7,5,t5_2qyz1

2460820,0,t1_cmfcqgj,Ive never directly hired parttime native English speakers but instead look to translation companies most companies here prefer to hire native English speakers to be editors rather than translators. This is the case with fulltime positions too. A foreigner costs a lot of money and moreover can edit four to five times the amount she could translate herself. Most Western translators top out at  to  Chinese characters net into English per day whereas Western editors can edit  Chinese characters worth of English per day. And of course a visa outside BJSHSZ is a huge hassle for any company.Ive evaluated dozens of local companies in Jiangnangreater Shanghai area. Most are not very good. Terrible quality ChinesegtEnglish parttime translation involving no foreigners whatsoever costs as little as  RMB per  characters. Its common for unscrupulous agencies to simply run things through machine translation and then have staff touch it up because theyre selling to companies that either dont care that much about quality or dont have the means to evaluate it. Decent quality costs  and good quality costs  RMB per thousand characters. So if you do want to work with local companies consider looking into software localization outsourcing firms which vend to companies that actually care about quality. The better firms might also let you work with their proprietary translation platforms!Western vendors pay more but might have you take a really hard test or demand things like translator certification.,ChineseLanguage,cmfuxjo,2,t5_2qyz1

I dont know what to recommend as I dont know what are your taste are. The thing with Chinese is unless you immerse yourself constantly with it its very hard to be fluent or even lose fluency in it like what happened to me. Another reason to recommend shows movies and books is because they provide natural motivation for improvement kinda like how people wanna learn Japanese because of anime Im learning Chinese because I want to get the  undiluted experience when watching moviesshows it doesnt take a fluent speaker to realise that Chinese is really hard to translate without deviate from its meaning and understanding Chinese enriches the experience so much more.A mistake a lot of people do is learning individual characters instead of words for example the Chinese word for sex is  people who learnt characters instead of words would just see Up bed. Also familiarize yourself with different definition of words for example another word for sex is  it can mean Dry or Fuck depending on how you use it thats why sometimes you see Chinese made shirts with a Do not fuck warning.To answer your question yes its definitely possible to be fluent in Chinese youre just gonna have to immerse yourself in it.

6723411,0,t1_d0eillh,Correct  is not a morpheme. A morpheme has to be a meaningful unit of language. It may be helpful in this instance to view Chinese characters as syllables forming words of one or more characters where each part may or may not have its own meaning. Sometimes in language each part of the word has meaning as in farmer with er meaning a person or thing that performs a particular function but sometimes the parts as you mentioned do not carry specific meaning like the cu in curry.What Id like to ask though is if a character or syllable in English or Chinese or any other language is a morpheme but does not carry that meaning in a certain context is it still a morpheme in that instance? For example the transliterated name  Jack means outstanding gram but does not carry that meaning in this context just like how not every word with the prefix re in English does not always mean again.,ChineseLanguage,d0erc21,3,t5_2qyz1

I mean surethere is technically a standard pronunciation contrived by the PRC Government but in real life almost no one talks like that.Could you elaborate on in real life almost no one talks like that?I beg to differ. Most mainland speakers whom I have interacted with speak according to the standard pronunciationtone or so called  when communicating with someone from outside of their . It is also the default that they would be aiming for when interacting with other people and the speaker is not sure about other peoples background. As much as I would love to sound more authentic when I am speaking Chinese as someone learning Chinese as a nonnative language and whos not yet perfect with producing the tones it just makes sense for me to focus on the  at the moment.I have clearly defined the two main accents in my previous post. That was however after I made an edit. Feel free to go back and read what I added in.gt The point is this guys pronunciation isnt wrong.Nowhere in my posts have I said that his pronunciation is wrong.I have only suggested that it is more helpful to advise the standard tonepronunciation. gt Native speakers dont have the standard tones memorized for every word. This speaker of Malaysian Chinese who was very kind enough did in fact know about the mainland usage of using the th tone for the syllable that I pointed out. This is where I have issue with. If he knew it all along and it can usually be safely concluded that learners of Chinese language are not aiming for Malaysian Chinese accent by default I think it does not make sense that he suggests his regional tone for that syllable.,ChineseLanguage,d44repv,1,t5_2qyz1

Furthermore this sentence is a bit confusing because it could be read as  modifying . But moving it to the front with  indicates that this is a sentence primarily concerned with a book.Similar for  which I think is perfectly fine without  if written as  which also moves the object to the front. However I think this second construction doesnt really satisfy the second condition of indicating that something is being done to the object.  could be followed by all kinds of things like  etc. in which  is obviously wrong because no action is being performed on the book though  works.,ChineseLanguage,d5oqs8v,6,t5_2qyz1

The easiest aspects to pick up include music you dont have to understand to like it dramas lots of subtitles and fashion Chinese girls are obsessed with these huge frames that make their eyes look bigger Asian guys love the trimmed sides and swept back hair.Aside from all that start learning Chinese on your own. Consider spending a portion of your summer abroad  thats the quickest way to learn about Chinese culture and language. Pick up a book on Chinese history or culture at Barnes amp Nobles. Go learn calligraphy. And considering China is a country that is roughly the size of the US you should look into what region you find yourself drawn to. When I traveled to China I fell in love with Shanghai and Chengdu. Beijing was blegh. Wanting to go back to those places is one of the biggest motivations for me learning Chinese in college. Lastly since youre in high school you should start looking for a college program that offers language classes for HERITAGE students students who can understandspeak Mandarin far better than they can write it.

10520236,0,t3_5qn7fn,The language spoken in Taiwan and China are basically identical. The biggest difference is accent with Taiwanese using a lot more z c s sounds and Beijing using a lot of zh ch sh and also tend to mix a lot of their words with .  There are some terminologies that are used in Beijing that arent used in Taiwan but that happens everywhere with language. Think of how the word soda is used in the western US but the word pop is more popular in the Midwest. Like  can mean potato in China but means peanut in Taiwan or Taiwan calls a tomato   vs chinas . In general the language is the same in the same way British English and American English follow the same rules but have different spellings and pronunciations for certain words. Wikipedia has a page on Taiwanese Mandarin. Id recommend Taiwanese movies as well for language immersion as itd help you understand the differences in accents as well. ,ChineseLanguage,dd0kz84,9,t5_2qyz1

10712310,0,t3_5t6gcf,It depends what type of word.  If its something interesting where I get the impression the meaning is not guessable from the hanzi used then I look it up and add it to anki.  If its something where I kind of get the idea without looking it up then Im more likely to just pass over it and worry about it it I notice it becoming a problem.I also make sure to always make a card for new hanzi unless they seem exceptionally unimportantlike  which I saw yesterday or stuff just from namesIll also mention that I strongly disagree that the only thing you should be doing is extensive reading.  Lots of readinglistening is important but if vocabulary is a big problem then you should make it a goal to increase your vocabulary.  Dont just ignore the problem and stick to boring readers with low vocab.  Of course this doesnt mean you should go read Tolkien level stuff as your first experience with native material but you shouldnt be afraid of a little difficulty so long as it is not so hard as to kill your motivation.,ChineseLanguage,ddkw7uu,1,t5_2qyz1
10736501,0,t3_5tljtm,gtIs this how one makes up for not having the relative pronoun thatwhich in Chinese?Short answer Yes. Longer answer Well  is the particle that youd use to introduce relative clauses Since a relative clause modifies a noun and  does the same thing in other constructions youve learned before  is the natural choice for introducing relative clauses.gtI suppose I might have not used the correct hanzi for to receive and everywhere for this context but the point here is solely the wordordersyntax. I hope you understand.Sure. Of course  is not the best way to say it   has a directionality to it that isnt translated by everywhere. It implies that one is out and about everywhere or at everywhere so its not used to describe an action originating from everywhere. Youre looking for the expression  an idiomatic expression that means all over the world. from and come from may seem similar in English but the former is a proposition and the latter is a verb  proposition.

10807047,0,t3_5ugoea,hi im a tobe TESOL teacher and im volunteering to teach as well English not Chinese because mine isnt that good. Some suggestions would be asking him to bring a picture then have him introduce people in there or talk about it if you teach vocabs on family members vacations etc customize it with whatever youre teaching show him a video then talk about it ask him questions what did he do? why do you think he did it? raise up grammar points through the video. I know how hard it is to only have one student and try to make learning fun. From what you said conversation and you reading to him are not only ineffective but also boring. Include lots of visuals cards pictures posters might help you can play game to test him time how many vocab words he can say from looking at a picture. You can printwrite out sentences and chop them up so he can put it back together or let him guess what a new word mean base on the radicals. Cover up texts and let him read only one portion to see if he understands. Dont give out definitions right away but ask him to guess the meaning of a new word base on other words that he know.For conversation get to know your student well will be good for you too. Ask him what he did what his family did his hobby his new shirt. You can also talk about yourself and let him ask questions. Pick something you know hes interested in. This will get him to talk more. You can look up ESL lesson plan online for ideas and just modify them accordingly. There arent a lot to do with only one student but it does not mean you cannot make it interesting. Be creative think of different ways to test his skills and knowledge while sticking with what catches his attention especially or younger students they like colorful picsvideos draw crafts. Using reallife examples and authentic information will help as well. Good luck ,ChineseLanguage,dduo5uh,3,t5_2qyz1

To me you basically only have  useful categories at a time. Current level the level above that and maybe the level below.
