1671703,0,t1_cjpiv1f,Yes you are correct.  I was just saying I am not a little kid as like to other KIDS on there that are really young or are really hyper and dont know how to play.  Obviously Im not a little kid but apparently you guys think Im saying this as a fact. Im a Teenager  but hell who cares Im just ready for some NHL! ?,NHL15,cjpvov2,0,t5_2x0ob
1832524,0,t1_cka0dvp,seems like most of the complaints are about offline modes...i cant stand playing sports games against only the AI. ill just have to try not to get addicted to UT packs like the other two games!,NHL15,cka0hhr,3,t5_2x0ob
1887921,0,t1_ckgo1cg,Exactly. Hitting Triangle on the player card PS will show you how many training spots they have and how many games left on their contract. Even if the contract expires if you keep the card it counts toward your collection. If you sell it then it doesnt.You can buy the contract cards and training cards in the auction house or get them in the packs.,NHL15,ckgopty,1,t5_2x0ob
1890189,0,t1_ckgxwx1,That is true but I did play NHL  and now I wasted my money on an almost exact replica of the game. EA scammed us and the only thing better about this game is the commentators which i hardly listen to anyways.,NHL15,ckgyk32,1,t5_2x0ob
2062368,0,t3_2hwsat,Efficiency. Saves time rather than playing the rest of the game out. Raging. Who cares honestly? People quit because they want to quit in the end. I could ask why anyone plays a sports game online but I wont P.,NHL15,cl1z05w,0,t5_2x0ob

2711767,0,t1_cnaujj9,too bad ps takes an hour to load every menu. Dont understand why  had that figured out but sony didnt.,NHL15,cncbf9x,1,t5_2x0ob
2719309,0,t3_2r6lgj,Its really based on momentum. You dont even need to use the hit stick. There is actually a setting that turns off hit stick.If you click in the right or left joystick they also do hip checks which a more effective especially when skating backwards and trying to pin against the boards.Dont try to hit a player head on...itll only end up with both of you on the ground.God I hate this game,NHL15,cnd69nm,1,t5_2x0ob
2847275,0,t3_2sk9o5,Its not real.  Put Bure on your team and tell me hes not faster than everyone else.  Its just that people make the mistake of thinking better players  better results it doesnt.  Skill is  of the game.,NHL15,cnrqgcv,2,t5_2x0ob
3263647,0,t3_2x38w7,I play on superstar but I find it easy to score I just use the players as a screen when I shoot from the point to score with defensemen and forwards I will shoot high corners unless I can get in front of the net cleanly and deke. I dont play fancy I just cycle the puck and shoot as much as possible for example when  I play the AI I will usually put shoot them  to  or so.,NHL15,cp0aeij,1,t5_2x0ob
3459994,0,t3_2zvb99,I had NHL on PS and I just bought the game for PS for the sole reason of playing EASHL. It is definitely worth it.,NHL15,cpmny9w,3,t5_2x0ob
4020203,0,t1_crehcny,Exactly. Its sad that we are now excited that a feature is coming back when said feature is a basslike expectation to begin with. ,NHL15,crej822,1,t5_2x0ob
