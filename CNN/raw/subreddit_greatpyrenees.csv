1345527,0,t3_296pul,We bought our Pyr from a rancher who bred working Pyrs. He charged . She did not have papers but was clearly a purebred she had the double dew claws and we saw both her parents. She was our first Pyr. Shes very sweet but sheds a ton. We have to vacuum every day. Still shes a great dog.,greatpyrenees,cikzkg9,3,t5_2uhd2

9708103,0,t1_da9dd4v,They can be but ours have always stuck with us off leash. Granted we normally only do it when we are at the beach or in an area unpopulated by distractions. I had one Pyr who  didnt leave when our gate was open just laid in the driveway and guarded the property. They like to be part of a pack we prefer keeping them in pairs and if they get bored thats when they get dangerous. ,greatpyrenees,da9qd7d,3,t5_2uhd2
10196027,0,t1_dbzqftf,My intention was to get a newfie looking through adoption ads i discovered Effie so on a whim I went to the adoption place.....When I arrived the women in charge brought him out.Effie was very sad and broken he came right up to me and placed his paw onto my lap. It broke my heart I fought hard to hold back my tears ...a big dog like him i thought shouldnt be without love and lots of it.After I got him home It took a long time for Effie to really bond with me.My other dog Lacy really helped him to feel at home they became instant friends and with lots of love from all of us ...Effie changed both physically and mentally me and him have an inseparable bond now wherever I am Effie wants to be there too.Here is Effie and Lacy now ,greatpyrenees,dbzrxwu,3,t5_2uhd2
10198873,0,t1_dbzzuwa,Our Pyr Candy is definitely definitely scared of men. When we have her at a pet store she hides behind us when a man comes up to her. She was scared of our vet too but she trusts me so she let them examine her as long as I was petting her. Im definitely part of her flock she herds me around and tries to protect me. Fiance not so much. She just tolerates him because he gives her food and pets. ,greatpyrenees,dc03kva,1,t5_2uhd2

11484632,0,t3_63wrtk,Oh what a sad story but what a happy ending. Many Pyrs get outescape and get hit by cars. So wired to roam. She is beautiful. A lovely senior!,greatpyrenees,dfxs4v7,2,t5_2uhd2
