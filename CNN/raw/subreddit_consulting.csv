Whether you get dinged could depend on the response you have to this question.gt getting a full time tech job is difficultgetting interviews are easy thoughThis is a big red flag to me. At least in my market the chances of getting the job once you get to the interview stages are usually much higher than that of getting past the CV amp application stage.Have you identified why you keep getting denied at the interview level? Its obvious that they like something on your application but lots of interviews without an offer requires some review though Im simply someone judging you by a few paragraphs. Maybe theres something to work on before you go to your next interview?gtI discussed pay ranges and they seems to be on Par with the tech jobs I normally interview for.Unless youre experienced with a highly marketable skill I would never bring up pay ranges until they explicitly ask me of my expectations in an interview.

I believe its where the opportunities are and are more transferrable than hard technical skills. Being uncertain and cagey is no good in an interview. If you told the interviewer that you would like to spend more years in tech before consultancy I wouldnt be surprised if they cross you off.

At a minimum for most good boutique firms they will be looking for a background in statsmath  for lateral hire that would mean a degree in statsmath and work experience applying it to client problems. The reason they pay more is because they demand more and their clients expect true expertise. Get out of visualisation and BI  its not what most data science boutiques do. Go into anything where you can apply hardcore statsmath to a complex business problem. ...or even become an actuary this has been a path for a few of my colleagues though the exams were insane.

2814832,0,t1_cno12yv,Even when I filter for location I get k with a huge range on Glassdoor. Some people at Manager level are making k but I just dont think its the norm.Also MBA programs compensation data is dubious. They have strong incentives to report high numbers and as far as I know the numbers arent audited. Neither are Glassdoors numbers but Glassdoor doesnt have the incentive to encourage overreporting. Inflated compensation data for MBA programs could easily be obtained through selection bias in sampling.For example straight out of undergrad I went to work for a nonprofit. Its not surprising that my school didnt ask me to respond to any employment questions  months or  months or a year after I graduated. It would be very easy for an MBA program to just select for students job functions or other categories in order to get the results they want.Anyways Im not an authority on compensation at all. Management consultants definitely make a nice living but a major source of compensation seems to me to be diverse and deep professional experience in a variety of fields. Its not about the paycheck and therefore to my original point not about the car you can buy. Its about leveraging current experience for future earnings.

It was my understanding from speaking with some of the people at Krappy Professionals Management Group I kid I kid dont shoot me that they were going to focus solely on organic growth as of now. Part of the problem with KPMG is that within the US they are traditionally the smallest of the B and unlike Pdubs or Big D the firm is still primarily accounting driven and consulting is not viewed as an equal business unit. Plus they spun off BearingPoint only for DeloittePwC to acquire the US operations a few years later.

It had a PC counterpart called Revelation and a later version called Advanced Revelation so I added that to my tool box and wound up in a couple of full time and consulting jobs doing development in PickRevelationAREV.Then I moved to VBAcess development for a few years and made my biggest jump at the time to SAP and SAP BW consulting. This kept me flying around the country for about  years doing implementations for various clients.I then decided it was time for a major change and joined KPMG as an I.T. Audit Senior. I did this for a couple of years but it never felt right for me. I was a databaseBusiness Intelligence developer I really took to SAPs Business warehouse product. But I was noticing a dearth of local SAP BW based openings. So I took a couple of  FT jobs that gave me the opportunity to learn and use the Microsoft BI stack. So I made the jump back to BI consultant where Ive been very busy for the last three years.So yes you can do it.

4733190,0,t1_ctqte5z,While the term Consultants tend to lend the image of the suit wearing Rolex sporting Business Management consultant.  The Bain Accenture etc. alumni theres more to it.  Theres a huge market for lower tier consulting and by lower tier really I mean lower cost.  Multinational corporations and big banksinvestment houses are only a small part of it.  For example there is a huge community not on reddit though... at least I havent found them hah of Consultants who specialize in the Construction space.  Also the same for Manufacturing Agriculture etc.  There are software systems tailored to each industry and usually a handful of really good ones and then a basket full of not so good ones.  Those systems all take expertise to implement and maintain.So if you have development experience you can try to just find a job anywhere or you can try to look at an industry that you have experience in.  Remember that IT is a core functional area to ANY major business these days it doesnt have to be a traditional ITfocused industry Construction is that way a lot of companies are just now modernizing their IT systems hence my paychecks.  I would probably start by looking for smaller lt  employees software development  Managed IT Services shops.  Thats a good place to get your foot in the door at least.  Anything with client facing projectbased work.

Im practicing cases for an upcoming interview and ran across a case that I didnt have the background to solve. Im a neuroscience PhD so this isnt surprising but I was hoping someone could point me to a resource to read more about this. Basically the case was about a company who recently acquired another company and wanted to know how they should proceed with the integration process.I sort of babbled my way through it by focusing on the individual business their strengths and weakness and tried to come up with a strategy that leveraged synergies to maximize revenues and minimize costs. I felt like I babbled through the whole thing much as I feel like I am right now.So I was wondering if someone might be able to point me to a resource where I could read more about this so I dont end up embarrassing myself any further.

5086786,0,t1_cuvumj1,I posted elsewhere here as someone who has worked at both McK this summer and returning next year fulltime associate and Deloitte out of college as a BA.So Ill say this on a high level  theyre both great firms and both will set you up for success.That being said a few points I respectfully disagree on here. Saying McKinsey people constantly get screamed at as a blanket statement is as far from the truth and ludicrous as everyone at Deloitte is chill and friendly. Neither statement makes sense to me. Trust me I was working at one of McKs most intense practices this summer and dealt with some tough partners and hours  extremely tough even by McK standards. But screaming? No. And Ive never heard of that happening from any full timers. Also Ive been completely reemed out by Deloitte partners when I worked there and made to feel completely unappreciated. There is absolutely no difference here  you will have completely asshole partners to work for in both firms and you will have great people as well. Its luck of the draw. I will say that McK perhaps works you a bit harder on average that much is likely true but I dont think its THAT much more.Also pointing out a person here or there that has a good exit from Deloitte is  fine because Im sure people there do great things after I know people from my analyst class did but  doesnt mean the exits are nearly as good as from MBB. This is just the fact. You WILL have a leg up and access to ops from MBB you wouldnt from Deloitte. Now is that to say a standout stud analystassociate from Deloitte cant end up at the same place as a mediocre MBB person? No of course not. But will a Deloitte person get a call from KKR or Goldman any time soon? Hell no. It just doesnt work that way. Is that fair and make sense all the time? No. Is life tough sometimes? Yeah it is.Finally you can always go from McK to Deloitte but almost never vice versa so going to McK and hating it as you say most do you can always make the switch down a tier. Finally I will agree with you that many people at McK burn out eventually and move on but I think that happens with client service in general.tldr I really think it is poor advice in  circumstances to choose Deloitte over MBB. McK is a clear choice here  people can be tough in both places hours can be tough in both places though probably higher on average at McK but projects and exit ops are significantly better at McK. Pay is probably relatively even at junior to mid levels. ,consulting,cuz5fix,1,t5_2r121

5226954,0,t1_cvflwl6,Sure no prob. As you can imagine any career change is a multifaceted decision but if I had to summarize my motives down to the bare bones it came down to not being ready to have my face buried in a text trying to memorize hard facts for years to come even though didactics end after . years theres still endless studying to be done afterward. Depending on what type of medicine you go into the MD path is roughly the same as consulting in terms of the number of hours a week youre doing something jobrelated. Im sure youre already equipped to work long hours but its the nature of the hours that youll want to make sure youre ready for. Memorizing information for  hrs vs. doing a task you know how to do for  hrs is just very different. I had a top  MCAT but that score was carried by my verbal and physical sciences scores whereas my bio lagged behind. In hindsight it was a clear indicator that I should have pursued something more strategy and language oriented earlier on. I just assumed that I would eventually learn to love Biology but that day never came. I certainly appreciate Bio but not love it.Anyway heres a quick and dirty list of tips Id like to shareLike I said in the previous post think about your core values as you make the decision and not take the route that others suggest. No one really knows what its like for you and how you feel about things other than you.Try not to let money influence your decision. I know this is a luxury not all can afford but if you can leave the dollars out of the equation. Both paths will more than take care of you financially although the MD will take longer to reach that point which is why pay difference doesnt matter in the long term.Make sure you really really love biology and are good with memorizing a lot of new stuff every day hahaI like what someone else said about the calling thing. Spend some time shadowingassisting a doc if you havent done so to get a small taste of what the job is like. Unfortunately this wont give you the perspective you need on the path that leads to where the doc is at. But there isnt really such thing as med student shadowing.  I suppose you could drop in on your local med school and listen to some lectures. Its not like theyll check for ID and kick you out or anything.,consulting,cvg1f6k,1,t5_2r121

6586386,0,t1_d00ihmu,I think it depends on what the research is. If you are researching something in direct support of an SOW deliverable like a fitgap of technologies in advance of a vendor selection then it might make sense to bill the hours. If you are building out your own sector knowledge then it might not. My stance has always been that a client should get direct value from every hour you bill. If the primary reason for the research is to fill in knowledge gaps that you should reasonably have to support the client that isnt directly value add for them we shouldnt bill them for that because we should have provided a resource that had that knowledge.  Its not like you dont get paid for those hours  that would be unfair.  We just dont bill for them and you dont get utilization. ,consulting,d00l3v0,3,t5_2r121

The firm theyre recommending me into is Kurt Salmon which from my preliminary research done on the firm seems to be an amazing place to work at.  What you said about wanting to show them you have the ability to pick something up is a great point.  Ill keep that in mind for sure when I go over my CV a few more times.  Is the stoic disposition in times of conflict more of a cover letter thing?  How did you actually highlight that on your CV?  Im glad you mentioned that story because I feel like I could probably put a few good stories down on paper.Also any thoughts on how to rephrase my writing experience into something that could be beneficial towards consultingsomehow make it stand out on my CV?  I dont think it came across well on the CV but I think its one of my experiences that has more potential than my other work related experiences.  So basically Ive been doing a part time gig mostly unpaid where I edit essays for prospective students applying to graduate schools on a per project basis.  I dont even know if Id call it a part time but in each project I take on Id go back and forth with the person Im helping and break down the objectives they want to touch upon in their writing and how to improve.  Wed exchange ideas about the tone the essay should have what qualities the person wants to bring out to fit their school of choice etc.  All of them got into Ivyleague tier schools Stanford Albert Einstein MDPHD Johns Hopkins.

7556571,0,t1_d314qj9,Its often hard to break down large goals such as starting your own firm. There will be multiple steps between now and achieving it and if youre very serious about it you should look to plan it out with at least the next  months broken down to a monthbymonth plan of actions  and repeat this process every year.It obviously depends heavily on your capabilities appetite for risk industrysector and a thousand other factors. But my opinion of what it would look like at a high level is  .    years. As per my previous comment  work within an existing consultancy firm or two for a few years..    years. Become a contractor as part of a resourcing agency  you should aim to get to the point where you dont struggle to secure work through your agency. This will let you know if youve got a productservice that people want when sold through an established organisation thus taking advantage of their networks and marketing and so on..    years. The next step would be to become an independent contractor in your field. Success here will demonstrate that you have a productservice in demand AND that youre capable of generating business for yourself..   years. To make the step up to running your own firm you would want to be able to generate more business than you can satisfy yourself.

Here are the tips that I can give you for staying locala Move to a place where there is a significant number of local or localish projects  it seems obvious but still needs to be stated.  If you live in Montana you will need to travel.  If you live in SF or NY then you increase the likelihood that you wont.  Even if you cant be truly local having a regional concentration of projects can at least enable creative travel like going back home on Tuesday nights.b Understand that there are several levers for staffing industry function client team location responsibility.  Understand that if you control for one location you must be flexible with the rest.  My own background is background is in west coast bleeding edge consumer tech but since having moved to NY Ive had to shift much more towards working on digitization for big old companies.  So it goes.c build your network with people  Partners who are established at local clients  the best projects can often be taken by the time the staffing announcements roll out so its best to get that feed directly from the sourced invest in developing capabilities that are useful for your locality.  Maybe you decide you want to do NYC fintech.  Well its unlikely that will work out on Day .  You should still seek out these opportunities if they exist elsewhere so that you become comparatively more valuable the next time a local project of that sort appearse if youre considering consulting for a career do this as early as possible. As someone who did not and am now midtenure it has been a challenge to rebuild a new base of champions and clients while maintaining existing professional relationships.

I had worked on a study with a client who was bringing in an outside brand to become an incubator project for them and I met the CEO of this startup while on the study. Through numerous conversations with the CEO and some of my mentors I insisted that I wanted to try my hands at entrepreneurship and was approved.Over the  months I was supposed to be in the business development role but  week into it I was promoted to become the next CMO with a team of  and no prior experience in running a marketing department. It turned into a fantastic experience of understanding how teams outside the consulting world works and just how much time managers are spending on simple things like recruitments and board meetings. I greatly valued the experience as a whole and when I came back to the firm I was seen as a eComm industry expert and helped to expand my profile within the firm.My recommendation is to definitely pursue it if you find an interesting project and find a Partner who is willing to help you push for it. Make a case for the value it might have on you and how that will translate to future client work.

Having talked to consultants at both firms I am aware of the differences in culture and problem solving approaches between the two and of the slight edge in prestige that McKinsey has over BCG. Ive been seeing a lot about McKinseys push in the Digital space which is getting significantly more coverage than BCGs Digital Ventures arm and this has me wondering how big the gap really is between BCG and McKinsey not just in the digital space but overall. It seems as though McKinsey tends to be constantly innovating and pushing in new directions while BCG is lagging behind. Is this gap becoming wider?

10022973,0,t3_5j7pzy,Happiness is highly comparative and much less absolute. As the research shows you need to make a certain amount to cover you bases. People wonder though why people much wealthier than them do not seem as happy and why they quickly fall into unhappiness again after that promotion which they thought that would make them truly happy.This all comes from the notion that the brain is a comparative mechanism which needs its basic needs to be fulfilled. The brain only reacts to chemical imbalances of natrium and calcium and not to absolute amounts. Your happiness is largely regulated by serotonine and dopamine. These neurotransmitters are only secreted when the expected level of happiness your positive reinforcement e.g. your longworked for promotion is active and unexpected. This means that the level of dopamine transmitted is higher than in the baseline situation. Hereafter the level of happiness your dopamine secretion you attained becomes your new baseline by being regulated quickly lowering the dopamine levels again. The loss of the true happiness you had after the last promotion makes you ache for the next spike of dopamine as it felt so good. And you are positive that after youll hit the next promotion youll be truly happy. The previous promotion was only a miscalculation and was not the end goal after all. Right?The painful truth is that there is no end goal that makes your truly happy as happiness is very delusive. Do things that make you happy on a daily basis while still being able to cover your bases on an absolute level. People say that its the little things in life that matter. This has perhaps painfully enough for us in the rat race a scientific basis as the small things that make you happy will give you a higher and more sustained frequency of neurotransmittrr secretion than one big reward.So for all who think that happiness comes from within is bullshit and that the next promotion will make you truly happy youre largely chasing a ghost. Your next promotion higher salary or higher social status indeed will make you happier on the short term but you accomplishment will soon be regulated by the wonders of nature. That is not to say that you shouldnt be ambitious. Many us chase as a byproduct of the rat race intellectually stimulating work and thats certainly something that can make you happier on the longterm. Just realize that you should be chasing a life that makes you happy and not a promotion.,consulting,dbe0rwn,3,t5_2r121

That being said every feedback I have should accomplish two goals point out flaws fallacies areas of improvement and mistakes made as well as outline a path to improvement and instill the motivation to get it done. Theyre around. And I believe that mistakes and sucky quality are both not inherently intentional so lets work together on making sure theyre the best asset to the client the team the company and most importantly themselves. I have a bunch of stories where Ive helped with feedback once and theyve helped me with other things more than a dozen times. I make the assumption that they want to improve... and I live by the wisdom that when people stop being honest with their feedback or stop feedback all together thats when youre done. Because thats when you know nobody cares to have you even improve. Thats why I think PIPs are the wrong approach since we all should be on PIPs all the time.

Then I was a group director for a large Chicagobased international engineering firm where everyone in the firm received a bonus as the intent was to award team work and everyone was considered contributing to the team. Of  course this was more popular and led to longer retention.,consulting,ddtrg0s,2,t5_2r121

11433786,1,t3_637v8a,I find it interesting that people who want to beat up the U.S. healthcare system rarely get into the details of Tort Reform.  If you want to know one of the biggest reasons our healthcare system is so expensive spend some time understanding of often lawyers sue and how expensive court battles are.  Understand how expensive Malpractice Insurance is to deal with possible future litigation.Then when youre done with understanding Tort Reform understand how noncompetitive the U.S. health insurance market has become.  It is a governmentcontrolled monopoly that allows for limited offerings per state.  In a free marketdriven country we treat selling healthcare insurance like we would if we were in a socialistic or communistic country.  Whats worse we let the insurance companies sit at the government decision table to help drawup the noncompete boundaries.Finally force Providers to publicly publish the costs of medical services so the market can compete and drive those costs down.Do the above and the arcane classification system will fix itself because there will always be a company thats hungry enough to provide more and better for less.Finally keep government politicians out of designing healthcare solutions.  There is nothing more incompetent or selfserving than a career politician.  We saw this over and over again with Obamacrap.,consulting,dfs0aw5,-3,t5_2r121

11518350,0,t3_64esdb,I think its important to frame your responsibilities in a way that works for you. I know when I was a more junior resource I basically was just doing all the things that people had asked me to do and there was little prioritization that I had to do myself since I basically had a senior or manager I reported to and that was it. When you get higher up and doing things that are much more involved youre going to have to learn how to prioritize what is important and what is not. This means  Lean on your team and support system more you dont need to be alone in everything that you do but figure out whats the most essential things for you to be able to do and have those be the things you manage pass everything else down Talk to your employer or someone whos higher up than you are as this is an issue because if they dont know  theres nothing they can do to help. Ive had a very good junior resource tell me they couldnt handle the work that my team and I were piling onto him and I backed off. Its not a big deal if you communicate it early enough. Learn how to separate work and actual life. We all suffer from this considering how stupidly involved consulting can be in your life with the MondayThursday travel occasional Sunday night flights and sleeping in a hotel  nights a week. It means you have to be a bit more involved in planning out weekends finding dates and going to have social interactions beyond your coworkers. It seems like when you dont hit a deadline that its the end of the world but it really isnt.Id consider talking with a coach or a counselor or even find a mentor thats been through this before despite how expensive all of it is. I assume youre making a pretty healthy salary for a single person you can afford it and it will pay off in the long run. ,consulting,dg1luge,7,t5_2r121
11518791,0,t3_64esdb,I concur with much of what has been said here. Many people blame employers for poor worklife balance but frequently it comes down to people failing to manage their own balance and communicate their needs to their colleagues and their superiors. This is often because were afraid that if we say no or if we dial back the timeeffort weve been putting in that we will be perceived as less of a team player or lacking in dedication. Unfortunately some managers or firms behave this way others dont. It sounds like youve been in the workforce long enough to be able to get an understanding of your options and at your current firm long enough to understand the culture and the attitudes of your superiors. Sit down and think about how you can communicate your personal and professional development needs who you can talk with and then execute. Your happiness and your health are of paramount importance  not your career.It sounds like your firm is big enough that they probably offer an EAP employee assistance program  you should DEFINITELY give them a call and see what kind of resources they will provide for help. There is absolutely no shame in availing yourself of this benefit and it can be tremendously helpful. Ive used it in the past and it absolutely saved me from crashing and burning.
