5912903,0,t1_cxum64f,I see I was referring to the second keyboard in the corner of the picture. I cant tell but it feels mechanical to me? I dropped something on it and a few buttons came off and they arent the electronic switches that i see on some appliances when I take them apart. ,mechanicalheadpens,cxupprf,1,t5_35mvg

8837195,0,t3_518nmx,Advised to post this here Id had no idea this sub even existed. Fountain pens amp mechanical boards I feel at home already! Oh and headphones though I am super happy with my QCs and wont be getting into those fancyass ones headphone amps? thats a thing??!. Id half expected to see watches here too in peoples posts as these sometimes appear in pen shots posted in the Fountain Pens Australia group. Another common crossover. Also whiskey!,mechanicalheadpens,d7a3txx,2,t5_35mvg

10560164,0,t3_5r449h,What nibs do you have for the ECOs?,mechanicalheadpens,dd543y7,1,t5_35mvg
10563316,0,t3_5r9d8p,Sensitivity tells you how loud theyll get and impedance tells you how much resistance the driver has but since they have their own power source and you cant plug them in neither of these specs are particularly important since they have their own amp. Honestly looking at headphones or speakers based on specs wont tell you much about how they sound and even looking at an accurate frequency response graph wont tell you everything. The only way to figure out how they sound is to listen for yourself or try to find a reviewer you trust. Check rheadphones if you want to find someone since thats probably your best chance. You could also try Super Best Audio Friends but Im not sure anyone there would really be interested in wireless stuff I dont use it but Ive heard its good.,mechanicalheadpens,dd5gz5w,3,t5_35mvg
10626528,0,t1_ddatxfe,Figuring out what is going on is half the fun! And even when you do do you really? Haha. Its my favorite book. I need to re read it this year. ,mechanicalheadpens,ddc1n0p,2,t5_35mvg
10734710,0,t1_ddmz2k3,Yes its the notched FA nib. I havent tried on that hasnt been modified though so I cant give you a comparison only my impressions on this one. I can however compare this to the Spencerian modded Falcon nib of which I have gone through two DNever had any problems with hard starting but that might be down to the extremely fine point this one has.Its picky when it comes to ink as it must be very wet  I basically only feed it Iroshizuku.  Yes it will railroad when pushed too far but that is when pushed really far and not something i notice when just doing regular writing and I tend to flex pretty hard.All in all Its a tricky pen. Scratchy super fragile picky when it comes to paper and ink... But god the contrast between the hairlines and the shading makes it worth it every day of the week.,mechanicalheadpens,ddn7ds2,3,t5_35mvg
