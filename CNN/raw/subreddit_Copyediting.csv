This accounts for downtime and gaps in clients hopefully similar to how a restaurant will charge about three times the food cost for a plate to cover overhead.Part of being freelance is that you dont get paid to sit around in the office. It sounds like you simply need to juggle projects a bit better or get more of them in general such that if youre waiting on one client to get back to you you can just work on another project for a different client. Long term projects like full manuscripts are nice for this since you can budget out a perday amount of time to work on them and have flexibility for any rush assignments.,Copyediting,co3vds7,2,t5_2tqkq

With reported speech you drop back a tense thus possibly giving the illusion that something isnt happening anymore but you are effectively just reporting something from a different perspective i.e.I love the Greenbay Packers and want them to win the superbowl said carradee.or as reported speechCarradee said that he loved the Greenbay Packers and that he wanted them them to win the superbowl.With the latter example carradee could have changed his opinion making the quote outdated but the author has no idea.. nevertheless if he chooses not to use a quote he has to use reported speech.,Copyediting,dcxngse,1,t5_2tqkq
