1713282,0,t3_2e1a53,This matchmaking issue is usually due to multiple reasons. One factor is the matchmaking can possibly be broken.Another is the player base time you queue. Im not sure on the numbers for people playing this game in general or simultaneously but I could assume its decent because my games I usually get matched with people of my tier. However I do sometimes get matched with people of lower tiers. That is usually due to not enough people similar to me queuing exactly when I do. If you play at odd hours of the day that can also be a factor.These are just a couple of ideas that come to mind when I see those unfortunate match ups.Dorito Dainty Dudley Dumpling,battleparty,cjv4dp0,1,t5_310en

1821488,0,t1_ck77sud,gtassuming an optimal...  champion kos and a full minion wave clearjust a small sidenote and im REALLY not trying to be belittling this is a pedantic sidenote but i dont think that im wrong when I say you when win the level  teamfight the first thing that you should do should be to clear a wraith the  monster campBUTassuming you get a  teamfight in the beginning of the game it literally doesnt matter what backpack youre running because you have a full level advantage over the enemy team. You should be able to  man one of their camps and leave before they respawn and walk to their camps.this will give you level  while your opponents are either  or . This would translate into your team being able to contest their next jungle camp respawn if they even arrive at the camp within  seconds of it respawning which will give you level  before your opponents which means you get goo buff controlYeah the early game teamfight is REALLY important. This is another reason why EE is a bad backpack. You really do want those early game statswell tbh its important to just not die and give your opponents level  from the fightanywaysgtEE can potentially give  ad... at level if youre fucking fully stacked at level  on your EE you are a godeven against bots i dont think I could pull that offI dont know if you were here before the EE nerfs but trust me man there is a reason why everyone went from running EE every game to saying it was garbage. Because it is.It gives marginally greater stats for a stupidly large riskI could see EE being used as a tank backpack now that it has cdr and good defensive optionsif youre the  in a v you HAVE to just win teamfight after teamfight. You do not push faster than your opponents v. DC buff doesnt make you push waves faster. it makes you better at fighting. If youre ever a member of the  in a  or v you want to just push waves because your opponents are going to be inferior in that department  You wont win a v by pushing lanes and out map maneuvering. Yes if youre fully stacked on EE than you could potentially v without dc buffbut as far as youre concerned trust me when I saw that NUWW or bella PB would push a wave JUST as fast as EE would and you arent risking anything AND you get a guaranteed late game power spike with NUWW or lotsoturret damage with bella throughout the whole game which really helps with lane clearing and camp clearing,battleparty,ck8od8e,1,t5_310en

1920005,0,t3_2gml7y,Ive been having tons of success with Lemongrab postpatch but Im inclined to disagree to an extent. I think what defines an OP character is either . Being so effective in a role that theres no point playing another character or . Having no hard counter whatsoever. Lemongrab most closely fits  if were talking OP when paired with the right characters Im hard pressed to find a better support champ who can have such an impact on momentum. But he doesnt fit  at all. Building TechnoBella makes you rely on a perfectly placed stack Dungeon with a follow up My Juice for a reliable kill. If you build more AD you sacrifice tankiness. He has no sweepingchase cleanup potential though Sound Sword helps. Ultimately though he is toptier now. Whether or not the Devs decide this merits a small nerf is up to them. EDIT Upvoted you for starting the discussion though. My opinion is mostly limited to mid Bronzelow Silver matches.,battleparty,ckkjpvs,4,t5_310en
1970760,0,t1_ckqnuqk,Ive noticed that Ninja is assigned to characters with big mobility like Gunter who actually has double Ninja and Flame Princess.Fighter means the character benefits from stacking up some AD and diving in to crush faces. Finn and Fionna are prime examples.Wizards on the other hand have abilities that are either spammable or have good damage ratios and thus can build Power Damage as their main damage stat. Examples Ice King with his low cooldown Q and W spells and Flame Princess with  of her spells passive very well suited to deal damage.Tanks are able to consume way more damage than an average hero. For example Jake has  HP from level  and Lemongrab likes tanking spells both due to his passive and his large natural shields. Dont forget that just because theyre tanks doesnt mean they cant dish out damage as well.Trappers have a root or stun. Important thing about roots in this game is that they also prevent dashes. Marceline dark energy shot roots for  seconds and Lich mind control forces enemies to walk at you for  seconds have reliable disables.Jinxers have more unusual spells like PBs Cherry Bomb that push enemies around or Rattleballs has a Vacuum ability to pull everyone in.,battleparty,ckqoe1v,1,t5_310en

3617401,0,t1_cq4l5tn,Yep but if you could get negative shield gauntlet would be the best item in the game. Nothung starts out pretty good too. It in fact out damages golden sword of they have over  armor and you have AD. Everyone in the game but lich starts with at least  armor some have  I think Lemongrab use to have  armor and every melee starts with AD.

3619486,0,t1_cq4rjd4,That makes perfect sense. I use to build Techno Tank on Finn all the time. I really like maxing Robo Suit lv to  now instead of maxing Tote because the defensive stats are so much better but some games you really do just need the movespeed.

3774610,0,t3_33lobg,Hunsons ult is sort of awful. At least with Gunters you can position your self to be some what safe. Hunsons requires you to be stacked up on enemy champions. Almost everyone has an ability that will cancel it and leave your ass vulnerable. You need a lot of targets under you to make the power vamp worth while. Enemy champions just tend to walk out of it with out taking significant damage. It only really combos well with Billys Empowered Amber Prison and Lemons Dungeon. ,battleparty,cqmj7kw,2,t5_310en
