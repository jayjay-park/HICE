It s a vast Gothic pile somewhere near Seattle with staircases winding up into the gloom and a hidden door to an attic room where a child s tiny wheelchair moves by itself. Scott plays the man who moves into the house. He s a composer who recently lost his wife and child in an auto accident and he s come to Seattle to forget the past. He rents the big old house because it has a large music room.Michael Straczynski was contacted by a source at Los Angeles City Hall. The source told him that officials were planning to burn numerous archive documents among them something Straczynski should see. The source had discovered a transcript of the city council welfare hearings concerning Collins and the aftermath of her son s disappearance. Straczynski became fascinated with the case he carried out some research and wrote a spec script titled The Strange Case of Christine Collins. Several studios and independent producers optioned the script but it never found a buyer.The style for women of all classes was to dress to create a boyish silhouette using dropped waist dresses cloche hats that complemented bob cut hairstyles furtrimmed coats and knitted gloves. Jolie said the costumes her Collins character wore formed an integral part of her approach to the character. Hopper consulted historians and researched archive footage of Collins to replicate her look. Hopper dressed Jolie in austere grays and browns with knitted gloves wool serge skirts accompanying cotton blouses Mary Jane shoes crocheted corsages and Art Deco jewelry. In the s sequences at the end of the film Jolie s costumes become more shapely and feminine with a decorative stitching around the waistline that was popular to the era.Straczynski s agent passed the script to producer Jim Whitaker. The House On The Lake  Frank Wood as Ben Harris So it seemed important to me to put in those clippings because you reach the part of the story where you go Come on he s got to have gone off the rails with this. Best Foreign Actress Trish Van DevereDirector of the Year Roberta Maxwell as Eva Lingstrom John Russell George C. Clint Eastwood said The period could not accept it. The character quotes the real Jones public statements throughout the film including the scene in which he has Collins committed.The introduction of brass instruments evokes film noir playing to the film s setting in a city controlled by corrupt police. The theme shifts from piano to a full orchestra and as the story develops the strings become more imposing with an increasing number of sustains and rises. Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of those in a horror film score during the child murder flashbacks. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Lennie Niehaus. It was released on CD in North America on November   through record label Varse Sarabande..   ,commonfolkmusic,cx1y3uh,1,t5_2xknu
