Now if youre talking about settings and assets for a more customized arcade youll have to wait until more custom cabinets are made.  On the digital cyber cherries site it looks like they are planning on releasing new packs in the future maybe with the help of the community here putting together awesome cabinet artwork ,NewRetroArcade,cpg1ndn,5,t5_37esf

8693059,0,t1_d4xt4o1,In order to get some of the Williams games working such as defender you need the  version of mamelibretro.dll made active for the Williams arcade rom you want to use it with a mame file structure with an nvrm folder in the EITHER the steamappsgtcommon folder or the root Cdrive try both use only one when you find what works and a save state nvram file in a folder with the rom name in the above nvram folder. I suggest after downloading the  mamelibretro that you rename it to mamelibretro.dll. Dont forget you must select this dll in the arcade builder or edit the xml file for a game like defender to use it. The  mame emulator is available in this archive here A workign core is also avaliable in a defender fix .rar file on the Internet here New Retro Arcade Neon when using the mamelibretro  emulator will read from a mame folder with subfolders that is located here steamappsgtcommongtmame. You should be able to use any version of mame to create your own nvram files and other files.For example the location that works for me for the defender nvrm file is steamappsgtcommongtmamegtnvramgtdefendergtnvram.You might find windows ? what works for you is cmamegtnvramgtdefendergtnvram.,NewRetroArcade,d6s9fqi,1,t5_37esf
8968183,0,t1_d7pu4mr,its a suggestion I made to them back in August as they were returning from Gamecom and I think from their response they had just heard the same suggestion from someone there.    I was wracking my mind trying to think of a way that would make this work.  Despite my lack of fully understanding how this stuff all works I was fairly certain doing this would be a decent solution even though it is a bit clunky.  ,NewRetroArcade,d7pu8zn,1,t5_37esf
