10467781,0,t1_dcto8ku,That picture has been used in news articles and the name used on that site is also the same name they said she used at her place of employment Vanity.  Also she hasnt logged into that site since September of last year.I think its possible her car left the road and was damaged which is why the car hasnt been seen and why the tracking stopped. They will find this car in a ditch or creek and she will be deceased.,Toni_Anderson,dcumoq1,1,t5_3io89
