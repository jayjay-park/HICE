142552,0,t3_1vpvjq,My Orchestral Remix of Eight Melodies from Earthbound ZeroMother. I always loved the kind Earth Anthem sound the original Eight Melodies had and worked very hard to bring it out as much as i could in my version. This is probably the most complicated song ive ever worked on using about  layered Instruments and huge amount of self composed parts including very complex harmonies. The remix is inspired by Vangelis Christopher Tin and Pachelbels Canon in D. It also got quite a few references to various soundbits from EarthboundMother . Its taking me literally forever to finish it. Its quite a change from the original version but I really hope you will enjoy this song. Feel free to link and share!,gamemusic,ceuo0sw,2,t5_2rmsp

It was ported to the Gamecube in  for the American and EU market. Two years later with the release of e featured an improved gameplay of the original but was only released in Japan.,gamemusic,d4pgim9,1,t5_2rmsp

10525913,0,t3_5qpx8j,I really like the way you were going with this! Can I just suggest that from the beginning it sounded like you had  instruments come in playing the same really cool pattern. But why dont you try doing what this final boss theme does where the  equivalent instruments at the beginning each play a different pattern?Im not sure if that would work its just an idea because when I listened the song I felt like it needed more complexity in melodiescountermelodies. Its really cool though.,gamemusic,dd186d7,2,t5_2rmsp

10804166,0,t3_5uiynv,The most notable for me are Undertale and Hopes and DreamHis Theme from Undertale One Final Effort from Halo  and the main menu theme to Starbound. Undertale and Hopes and DreamsHis Theme both made me step back for a second and made me cry by the time they finished. The dialogue that is said during both those moments tore into me and the music dealt the final blow. One Final Effort marked the end of a era for me. The final part to what I think is one of the best games of all time and a phenomenal trilogy. Marty ODonnell really knew how to create an epic soundtrack to get you going. Halo s ending made me cry because it was over. My favorite story had finally come to an end. The first time I booted up Starbound I sat for about  minutes listening to the opening theme. I am actually listening to it now. Its so simple but carries so much emotion. It feels hopeful but distant at the same time. It also feels as if there is some melancholy attached to it. A YouTube comment on the song upload put tears in my eyes as I listened to the song. It read My friendsss... the top of one world just wasnt enough for you in the end. You had to climb higher... sssee all the peaks your hearts yearned for. Explore far into the ssstars. We had only each other and ssship but we made the most of it. Heresss hoping thisss peak... at the top of our homeworld... isss where you wouldve wanted to ressst after it all. Ill never forget you. Or the adventuresss we had. Thank you friendsss. May you find green fieldsss and higher peaksss wherever you are. From the Diary of a Floran left at atop a mountain upon a lush flowering world. Beside it three graves. One detailed in Avian markings one adored with an Apex Insurgents Helm and one with a Hylotl blade laid at its side. All around the site flowers bloom planted by hand and gathered from across the cosmos.Its thing like this in Starbound that keep me coming back to it.,gamemusic,ddudgp8,22,t5_2rmsp
