3105540,0,t1_cojvqdp,That reminds me of this lovely article that picks apart the awful rhetorical devices that our opponents just love to use to make themselves seem intelligentgtSarcastic ParaphrasegtThis device is discourse cancer. Seriously. If you mapped the downfall of a forum relative to how frequently this device is used I would bet money you could get a strong positive correlation going. There is this mistaken assumption that satire including this kind of satire is intelligent or witty or indicative of intellectual sophistication. It is none of those things. Satire is easy. Writing like The Onion isnt hard. The sarcastic paraphrase is one of the laziest ways to argue because it doesnt require a clear and coherent logical structure  the terms of argument are implied. As such fallacies are harder to expose.gtThe sarcastic paraphrase presents a loud or obnoxious mocking paraphrase of the opponents position with a counterposition implied through the sarcasm. It does not have to be in all caps. You can sound sarcastic if you write with exclamation points too!

Although some of the sites make an attempt at civility and try to back their arguments with facts they are almost all thick with misogynistic attacks that can be astounding for the guttural hatred they express. What follows are brief descriptions of a dozen of these sites. Another resource is the Man Boobz website manboobz.com a humorous profeminist blog its tagline is Misogyny I Mock It that keeps a close eye on these and many other womanhating sites.If you use a site called manboobz as a source I think its safe to say everyone should ignore you.
