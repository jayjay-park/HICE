Several predefined ones exist i.e. propvehiclejeep propvehicleairboat propvehicleprisonerpod etc and setting the model for a propvehicleprisonerpod to a chair will probably work.

6196252,0,t3_40ggyq,Initially I extracted the addons using GmadExtractor and packed the additional contents into my map. Few days later a creator whom works Ive placed into my map contacted me and wished to have it removed from my map. I managed to settle the dispute by repacking the map without the custom models and created a workshop collection that lists the addons required by subscribers of my map. Obviously this was proven to be an unpopular move among the existing subscribers as they now have to subscribe to more addons just to avoid the errors and missing textures. However I myself too considered it unethical to repack the works of others despite already giving them credit as it might discourage others from downloading their submissions.,hammer,cyty4uk,1,t5_2rtqo
