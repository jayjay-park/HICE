9051824,0,t1_d7wv89a,Yes I helped build the archives site most of the good Flint old bands are on it. It needs to be redone.Phil Scary is a graphic designer now down near Detroit and Jim the last I heard of him was after he was in some normal rock band from NOLA they were on Letterman or something back in the late s. At the wake they did a Phil Boxed Set both of his records stuck in a pizza box with a Dissonance sticker on it. I took one.Edit  Phil S would wear his Taco Bell uniform to school because it technically passed the dress code. Like his dirty uniform haha.,flint,d7zvvd9,2,t5_2rmf0
9709880,0,t1_da69zyb,sorry for the late reply but I am assuming based on your college choices you want to major in engineering? If that is the case I would not go to UM flint for all  years. I have heard from some friends there that they were not pleased with upper level engineering teachers and courses. They blame the two plus two program for taking a lot of the best students away from UM flint and as a result the institutions focus on it. This is definitely anecdotal so I would do even more research on that but this brings me to another option what you could do is go to UMflint for the two plus two program. You go there for two years and if you hit certain goals for GPA then you get to transfer to Ann Arbor hassle free. Ann Arbor has an amazing engineering program. I would look into that especially if you have good aid and scholarships to flint. ,flint,da9y9iz,1,t5_2rmf0
