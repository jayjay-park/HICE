2222121,0,t3_2kifv4,I feel like I HAVE to get it. The Herald is the reason I finally caved and began to back the game.Shortly after they hit whatever Stretch goal it was that unlocked the Herald I read the description and it triggered a total William Gibson Neuromancer moment. My imagination ran wild for a bit.a few sentences in the description made the scope of this game really hit home. Featuring a powerful central engine for high speed transit and generating the power needed for effective data encryptioncontainment advanced encryption software and an armored computer core the Herald is unique among personal spacecraft in that it is designed to be easily cleaned when in danger of capture. The Herald includes an array of heavy duty internal options for data protection including redundant power subsystems and EMP shielding and a highpowered broadcast array for data transmissionInfo wasnt simply going to be another tradable commodity basically no different than algae medical supplies or Fuel Cells but actually an entire gameplay mechanic involving hacking and security and god knows what else.Thats when I thought no fucking way is this going to get made thats too much awesome. BUT Im going to do my best to help it happen.The rest is a sordid tale of poor budgeting decisions.,TestSquadron,clma9jt,3,t5_2y0r3
