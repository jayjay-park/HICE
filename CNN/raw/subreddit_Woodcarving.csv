882582,0,t1_ch4lpeg,ampampamp Coping saw sfw gtgtA coping saw is a type of hand saw used to cut intricate external shapes and interior cutouts in woodworking or carpentry. It is widely used to cut moldings to create coped rather than miter joints. It is occasionally used to create fretwork though it is not able to match a fretsaw in intricacy of cut particularly in thin materials. Coping saw blades are always thicker and much coarser cutting than typical fretsaw blades and many others of its family members.gtA coping saw consists of a thin hardened steel blade stretched between the ends of a square cshaped springyiron frame to which a handle is attached. The blade is easily removed from the frame so that the blade can be passed through a drilled hole in the middle of a piece of wood. The frame is then reattached to the blade and the cut starts from the middle of the piece. Long cuts perpendicular to the edge of the material are possible but the shallow depth of the frame rather limits how far from the edge one may cut. The much deeper frame of the fretsaw is more useful for cutting well away from the edge but conversely cannot manage the thicker materials commonly cut by the coping saws.gtThe coping saw blade is removable by partially unscrewing the handle. The blade is prevented from rotating by means of the short steady bar provided where the blade is attached. Loosening the handle also allows the blade to be rotated relative to the frame as desired. Carefully aligning the finger steady bars at the top and bottom of the blade ensures that the thin blade is straight and not twisted along its length. Retightening the handle tensions the blade and locks it at the desired angle relative to the frame. The short steady bar nearest the handle is held securely between finger and thumb while the handle is tightened to ensure the blade remains at the desired angle. Unlike the fretsaw the coping saw blade has holding pins which lock securely into the angled slots of the rotatable blade holders.gtgtImage i  A coping saw.Interesting Fretsaw | Scroll saw | Fretwork | Coping joinery Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwchlpla oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletechlpla.

3053316,0,t1_coebutv,A few times probably isnt enough.  I  do around  times per side after a fresh sharpening.  Try cutting paper right after sharpening it if it cuts paper really cleanly but starts breaking down pretty quickly with wood you need to strop more.  What happens is the edge is so thin it isnt strong enough to handle the wood.  More time on the strop right after sharpening puts on a microbevel which adds quite a bit of strength but is still small enough that you wont notice it.  Once you get things squared away  strokes each side on the strop every  minutes should keep it sharp for a long time.  Best of luck,Woodcarving,coeh2w7,1,t5_2sz8p

6773522,0,t3_487e99,I have one extremely similar to the Powerplus one.  The flexible attachment makes detailing work mush easier because you can get right up in it plus if you look in stores they sell for about the price as one of these kits so already youre ahead. Also the case is a great accessory because everything is in one spot making storage and travel a breeze.  I wish I had the clamp stand thing I always have to find a place to hang mine from which makes it a bit of a hassle.  For the price and adjustable speeds hands down is the best option.  You can go to any hardware store and buy Dremel bits to fit this if and when you break the ones in the kit.  Ive had mine for about  months and it hasnt burnt out yet which is longer than I thought I would be able to use it for.  I compared a lot of different rotary tools when I was buying mine I wish I got this one just for the added stand but still a great deal.  You may get one that craps out on you but for the price and the utilities that you can then keep and use on a different rotary tool I say it is  worth it.,Woodcarving,d0k27xk,2,t5_2sz8p

7309731,0,t1_d28p5ss,This is one of the most informative posts Ive seen in this sub. Awesome information. Rice bran oil Ive seen sold at specialty food stores. Ive used it for cooking as it imparts no flavor and has a very high flash point much higher than normal cooking oils. I dont know if theres a correlation between flash point and iodine number but the lower iodine number oils you listed also burn at lower temps. Sunflower oils nice for cooking because it doesnt burn as easily. Same with avocado oil. Havent cooked with walnut oil only used it on a few bowls. I live in a mild humid climate so curing some finishes takes a while.Edit Wiki has Rice Bran oil as under  iodine value so Im thinking there isnt a correlation and its probably not a good curing oil. Hemp seed oil however is listed over  in a few places. Might be worth a shot.,Woodcarving,d292er9,1,t5_2sz8p
7425473,0,t3_4gz4le,Never charged for a carvingIm not that good but as a freelance artist I can tell you how I do it.  Just treat it like any other job.  Come up with how many hours it took you to make it and think really think about how much your time is worth to you.  Include how long it took you to come up with the idea as well mental thought is worth something.  Once you have your hourly figured out see if the price is right.  Since its your first piece you might consider making a deal but I might warn against this unless its a friend.  If you sell something for  and its worth  then repeat business isnt going to pan out.  Likewise if someone buys your work for x amount and recommends you which is what you want then the person they send over will expect the same price.  As an artist never undersell what you are or youll find yourself worthless.  It took me years to learn this and I lost clients as a result but the ones Ive secured have allowed are much better.  Ive found that people that dont have the money to buy something at its worth really just dont appreciate how much its worth.  I make a living just doing art now but I could have done it much sooner had I realized my value.  Good luck. edit if you are making quotes do your best and eat the cost if you cant deliver what you promise.  On the invoice for the piece make sure you include those hours in your rate but make note they were free.  That will save you in the future.,Woodcarving,d2m884i,8,t5_2sz8p

10176077,0,t3_5kv2j2,The Flexcuts are decent and you should get years of use out of them with a little care. Strop them using one of the Flexcut slip strops  as you carve. When I first started carving Id strop each tool as I finished using it but over time Ive learnt to feel when an edge needs more honing either by the difficulty in pushing it through the wood or if I get more tearing than I think I should. I rarely ever have to sharpen the Flexcut tools but a few passes over a fine diamond sharpener like  for the flats and a fine rounded slip stone for the insides no link couldnt find the one I have.ProTip to keep your fingers healthy always think about where the gouge is going to go beyond the cut and dont put any body parts in the way.  This way when not if the gouge slips out you wont get injured.  And yes I think we all learn this way... at least with a super sharp tool the cuts are clean and heal fairly quickly ,Woodcarving,dbxij5u,1,t5_2sz8p
