North Texas is just what theyve called it locally for ages. Nightly news calls it that its nothing odd to locals... So with it in Arlington a city that has paid like crazy for those stadiums and doesnt want to just be where dallas teams are located Im sure they insisted on north Texas  ,wildcats,cgh88ic,2,t5_2s4oi

If you get a parking pass which is the way to go IMO stubhub one or visit a local scalper at the stadium get there early and tailgate. Get a bucket of chicken and a case of your favorite beverage and enjoy the atmosphere beats the hell out bars IMO.  Otherwise Winchells or Marikkas both on Southland drive are solid and close to the stadium...perhaps even walking distance about  miles. Both serve food. Go in early and enjoy the pregame atmosphere.,wildcats,cu21jaz,2,t5_2s4oi

8706252,0,t3_4z44zg,I still have my autographed picture from Pitino. I look at it occasionally and wonder what if we had won that title in . What if Derek Anderson had played. Would Pitino still be here? Would we have ten eleven maybe even twelve titles? It sucks but we should honor him for what he did for this program. But definitely not now. Maybe one day he and Calipari can have a relationship like Joe B and Crum and look back and laugh at there disdain for each other. Then we can honor Pitino. Maybe fifteen or so years from now.
