3019386,0,t3_2uor1e,The big question is what this guy is going to be like in  years. When you are  youre only starting to learn how to think for yourself and start questioning yourself and those around you. I mean for sure he isnt some kind of a child prodigy but Id say its a good thing that hes trying to take up the more intellectual pursuits in comparison to his peers. The question is whether hell become a selfimportant neckbeard knowitall or not. Having been on a similar path myself Id say the make or break factors are  having welladjusted friends who you respect on an intellectual level having a fun social life outside of your studies. Drinking and partying in particular! DGood luck to that kid whoever he is!,yahooanswers,coaygbd,1,t5_2qqo6
