3330087,0,t1_cp7s74n,gtThe operational aircraft had the official designation of FA. Most modern U.S. military aircraft use post designations in which the designation F is usually an airtoair fighter B is usually a bomber A is usually a groundattack aircraft etc. Examples include the F the B and the A. The F is primarily a groundattack aircraft so its F designation is inconsistent with the DoD system but it is an inconsistency that has been repeatedly employed by the U.S. Air Force with several of its ground attack aircraft since the late s including the Republic F Thunderchief and General Dynamics F Aardvark.,WarplanePorn,cp7uush,3,t5_2tugx

11093151,0,t1_deoy9hh,There were a lot of things we couldnt do in an SR but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if because of this fact it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there at least for a moment.It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed  hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts  feet below us I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was finally after many humbling months of simulators and study ahead of the jet.I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was with no really good view of the incredible sights before us tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult too for me to relinquish control of the radios as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground however. Walt was so good at many things but he couldnt match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center far below us controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope albeit briefly we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied November Charlie  Im showing you at ninety knots on the ground.Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna or to Air Force One they always spoke in the exact same calm deep professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the  Houston Center voice. I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this countrys space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didnt matter what sector of the country we would be flying in it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely over the years pilots always wanted to ensure that when transmitting they sounded like Chuck Yeager or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.Just moments after the Cessnas inquiry a Twin Beech piped up on frequency in a rather superior tone asking for his ground speed. I have you at one hundred and twentyfive knots of ground speed. Boy I thought the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue a navy F pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. Center Dusty  ground speed check. Before Center could reply Im thinking to myself hey Dusty  has a ground speed indicator in that milliondollar cockpit so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it ol Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. Hes the fastest dude in the valley today and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply always with that same calm voice with more distinct alliteration than emotion Dusty  Center we have you at  on the ground.And I thought to myself is this a ripe situation or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still I thought it must be done  in mere seconds well be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.Somewhere  miles above Arizona there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally and with no emotion Walter spoke Los Angeles Center Aspen  can you give us a ground speed check? There was no hesitation and the replay came as if was an everyday request. Aspen  I show you at one thousand eight hundred and fortytwo knots across the ground.I think it was the fortytwo knots that I liked the best so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say in his most fighterpilotlike voice Ah Center much thanks were showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A.came back with Roger that Aspen Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.It all had lasted for just moments but in that short memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed and more importantly Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine days work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.For just one day it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.,WarplanePorn,deped13,1,t5_2tugx
