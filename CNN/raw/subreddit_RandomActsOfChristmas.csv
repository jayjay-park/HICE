I know the kids dont know its their first Christmas but the parents do and IMO its a special time. when I was a teen mom and my first baby was  months old on his first Christmas we didnt have money to get a tree or presents or decorate or anything so it was kinda a bummer. However we did go to a family members house for Christmas day so he got presents there and it was fine but not everyone has a family to go to. JMO and it doesnt affect me at all since were not having any more kids and all of ours are over a year old.ETA I can see not allowing requests for as yet unborn children but just not too sure about the not under one year rule.,RandomActsOfChristmas,cn6t4sn,4,t5_2t3dk

2672676,0,t3_2qls47,Its so sad that this happens it ruins the magic. I agree with those who posted before me though you failed no one. You went out of your way to try and help someone. YOU did beautifully if in fact that person scammed you it lies on their conscious now. They have to wake up every morning knowing they conned a CHILD out of a gift. And if that person did scam you I really hope that eats at them. ,RandomActsOfChristmas,cn7fwdp,4,t5_2t3dk
2681529,0,t1_cn6vcx6,I agree with photo part because even though I put my childrens pics on theres reasons like custody issues foster children etc where a child can not have a picture on the internet for everyone to see. I know this year I tried using imgur threw my phone and it simply didnt work for my  year old pic so I emailed it to a mod. She was leaving on a marching band trip and I was late in posting already. But if one can not provide a pic for all to see I think sending it to a mod to verify or to a Santa asking should be ok. ,RandomActsOfChristmas,cn8lh6t,1,t5_2t3dk
2681631,0,t1_cn8lox7,They were very happy to get their gifts.  The things you guys got for them were their most favorite gifts of the whole holiday.  Mia is using her little makeup kit box to carry nearly everything she can fit in it and Ive had to threaten her with bodily harm if she doesnt let me wash those pajamas!  Tyler is working hard on his Perler beads and completed his skull puzzle less than  hours after he got it.  He wont let me see what hes making with the thread art kit because its a late birthday present for me and his sleep pants have made him warm and cozy!  The chess set and Snap Circuits kit have also been wildly popular I had to referee a chess match last night along with helping the little one figure out her next moves and Mias face has been made up in a new and fascinating way every day since Christmas.  You guys really gave them some great experiences and memories so thank you!,RandomActsOfChristmas,cn8lygr,3,t5_2t3dk
