6124419,0,t3_3zec3d,There is one semipaved part you have to do at the very start of the ride because they dont want you taking the steep main road up to the road.  Im not sure if they would be ok with you just walking it.  They want you to take this path which has some ruts and roots and not all that difficult or long.The main road isnt totally flat its pretty easy rolling hills with a few short climbs.  On a clear day you get awesome views of the entire Bay Area and its short enough you might as well do the loop in both directions.  Very few cars just park rangers and the tour tram.  Once I got a ways away from the main ferry dock I encountered very few people.Also the restaurants dont open until June and fewer ferries run this time of the year.  I dont know what that semipaved part will be like when its rained recently maybe kind of muddy.,BAbike,cyls6qf,2,t5_2sfn4

7347554,0,t1_d2dbabs,The Bay Trail may work for you Its not fully connected from Berkeley to SJ so there will be decent chunks through traffic but a good percentage of the route would be on the trail.
