1980234,0,t3_2hdzb0,Overall team looks great you will be absolutely stacked at WR with Green Megatron and Dez. You can roll with Rivers all year I think hell finish top . Youre weak at RB and TE post trade but I think Gore will rebound. Any RBs with upside on the waiver wire?,12TeamStandard,ckrthzj,1,t5_33ppk
2013897,0,t1_ckvu7qp,My record right now is . This week I am down  going into monday night. I have Gronk and Vereen to play while my opponent has Brady this game is up in the air for now. I have swapped Sanu for Marvin Jones  did this on saturday hopefully I will get production from there. What are some WR that you think are in reach of a Kaepernick  williamssmith trade? Im trying to get AJ off the guy who has  QBs that are doing worse than Kaepernick but I have yet to get him to even offer a counter. I am banking that Tate will be my Starting RB when he is healthy. ,12TeamStandard,ckvvdkh,2,t5_33ppk
2026878,0,t1_ckxdeba,General question How valuable it it too keep blount on your bench if you have L. Bell? Ive heard people use the term about handcuffing your starters backups but is it worth keeping them over a potential help to your team? Unfortunately I was beaten on Waivers for Mckinnon but the person who picked up Mckinnon dropped AP so he is out there on the waivers. Im going to have to follow his appeal because that could be an excellent pickup if his suspension is dropped. ,12TeamStandard,ckxgjvr,2,t5_33ppk
