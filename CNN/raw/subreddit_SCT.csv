218977,0,t1_cf372m6,Thanks so much for sharing! Im glad things are starting to turn around and that there are people out there who can relate so closely to these problems. Some of your points really hit home especially the nonauthentic smiling something I employ quite frequently. I saw an interesting TED talk about how body language can alter the physiological states of your brain. The tag line was instead of fake it till you make it it should really be fake it till you become it. I guess I experience that in some capacity. I started forcing myself to chuckle at minor comedic instances and sure enough I now laugh pretty naturally.Now that Im aware of this disorder Im still having a difficult time differentiating between who I really am and what the SCT imposes on me. Im sure that line is really blurry but I have been able to identify some traits that I think are heavily influenced by SCT in addition to the fogginess Difficulty expressingfeeling emotions I have a real hard time expressing my feelings towards my loved ones. Whether its my parents or former girlfriends when I dont really feel too much in their presence. Its hard to describe but I guess apathetic would be correct term. And when those feelings do arise I cant seem to communicate them for the life of me. Extreme Indecisiveness Whether its choosing the right word to use in a sentence or picking out groceries I have a horrendous time making up my mind. In the grocery store Ill blankly stare at the aisle for minutes weighing the alternatives until I realize how much of a bitch Im being and rashly throw something in the cart. I have no idea why or how I picked the school that I currently attend and I damn sure have no idea what fing career to go into. Subpar memory Its hard to understand what normal is when it comes to memory but Im sure I fall short of it. Everything is so blurry high school books Ive read in the past what I ate for breakfast information I learned in a class last semester etc.. This could be the result of excessive alcoholweed consumption but I know much bigger partierssmokers who have vivid memories. Thats all I can think of now but each day that passes I discover more and more facets of my life that may be influenced by SCT. Im still hesitant to place all my eggs in one basket but Im fairly optimistic about treatment potential. Regardless discovering this disorder has been such an eye opener and will hopeful allow me to finally take control of my life without it slipping by one blurry day at a time. ,SCT,cf3dxxy,2,t5_2v6pi
