8931241,0,t1_d7ky39w,I hear what youre saying. Im really tired of being a solution. Of course you get the satisfaction from it but at the end of the day you get abused. Its just not worth it sometimes. You do good stuff but not much of good things happen in return. I dont have high expectations but at the same time I dont expect to suffer because of being helpful. Especially when you do stuff for free  people tend to take an arm and leg when you give them a finger.Once again why should I care if nobody cares in return?,GearS2,d7lej5o,1,t5_39tmy

Just let it sit there for another  seconds why it went through the menu. Ended the vm call and then the notification cleared. Annoying but it worked for me. ,GearS2,dbcyeao,1,t5_39tmy
