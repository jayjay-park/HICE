100129,0,t1_cepdesv,Young nani jones fellaini all out.  Van persie rooney unknowns although I suspect rooney will play if he has a metal spike through his chest.  Evra came off vs swansea with an ongoing knee injury but I doubt he will be out.  Moyes has been pretty guarded over injury news.  It used to be that we knew exactly who was available under saf.  Now though unless a player is definitely out for weeks we have no idea whether theyll be available.  Probable starting squad    .................welbeck..............    Kagawa....rooney...valencia    ...........fletcher...carrick.......    Evra......vidic.....evans...rafael    ......................de gea...............Could be januzaj for kagawa and smalling for evans.  Van persie could possibly make a surprise come back as it was rumored recently that he was only a week away before the bs reports that it would be six weeks surfaced.I wouldnt bet on rvp playing though.,footballtactics,ceptwd7,4,t5_2st3z
101673,0,t1_ceptwd7,What about Bttner on the left wing in a  like such .......... DDG ..........Rafael..Vidic.. Evans.. Evra................Carrick.................Valencia.. Kagawa.. Rooney.. Bttner............... Welbeck...........With the likes of rooneyKagawa falling in to help Carrick in advancing the ball Bttner can better cover the left defensively and has some ability to attack.. the RK partnership in the middle will allow them to pin one or both of ramiresLuiz or whoever else plays CM back with external defensive cover.. Feel free to destroy but on paper it works..,footballtactics,ceq08og,0,t5_2st3z
464166,0,t1_cft0kuc,Very nice write up. Thanks for the indepth explanation! Come from Europe but grew up in America and I am very well aware of the  that is implemented at an early age living on the West Coast haha. Ill be taking over a U and a U team. Im guessing both will be coming from a  system. Im sure the U can handle some changes but Im thinking whether I should push a flat  with the Us. Seriously though excellent advice and much appreciated. First time having full coaching reigns only asst coached high schoolers and vs with even smaller ones haha so taking in as much info as possible. D,footballtactics,cft0zjb,2,t5_2st3z
1782813,0,t3_2exioz,Absolutely NEED to watch Marseille this season but been too busy recently Bielsas awesome! It will obviously take a long time for the team to get accustomed to Bielsas system which showed against Bastia in the first game when they ran out of energy will be nice to see them develop as the system progresses. Just wish Valbuena had stayed around!Might skip out on the BVB match and get back to them once Kagawas playing wouldnt miss out on that reunion.Staying on the Bundesliga I recommend anyone to watch Bayer Leverkusen vs. Hertha Berlin on Saturday  GMT  potential to be one of the best teams in Europe if Schmidts their manager Red Bull Salzburg were anything to go by against Dortmund they were immense in the st half and smashed Copenhagen midweek!If youve got nothing to do whilst waiting around for Sundays big clash in the PL PSV are playing Vitesse at  which should be an interesting clash.,footballtactics,ck3vlti,5,t5_2st3z
3435081,0,t1_cpjpogw,These drills look more suited towards players under  who are not technical. If they cant pass the ball without pressure then there is no way they will grasp it under heavy pressure. Doing these at the beginning of practice for  minutes will give them a foundation to progress to heavier progression.,footballtactics,cpjtpa5,1,t5_2st3z

5176878,0,t1_cv9m4qc,Hey mate thanks for this  it really does give me that little bit extra motivation to keep making videos for articles when people comment on how they appreciate it!As always what Dortmund do in possession in one area of the pitch has a massive effect on other areas. The guys at Spielverlagerung I linked the article in the piece did a really good analysis that showed how BVBs focus on building up play on the left hand side of the field allows them to do quick switches of play across to the right to Ginter who often then gets into great attacking positions as a result. His goal in the opening game v Monchengladbach was a great example of this,footballtactics,cva05cl,5,t5_2st3z
8132501,0,t3_4qmi38, defenders usually   CentreBacks and  Full Backs. defenders   CentreBacks. at the back is generally seen as more defensive as in a man defence especially with the increased versatility of full backs in the past decade only the centrebacks are solely tasked with defending. The full backs will be expected to join in with attacks by making overlapping runs and generally offering an outball by hugging the touchline during buildup play. A man defence means that a team has  centrebacks ergo  players tasked solely with defending.A further point about  and  man defences in practice Id argue theyre the same thing especially in a  formation with only a few exceptions. A  man defence would expect their full backs to track back in the event of loss of possession making a  man defence. The only instance I can conceive a  man defence not being the same as a  man defence would be if a team is just sitting back deep in their own half and soaking up pressure to eek out a win although in that situation its arguable if formations are really relevant at all given that space is so constricted that the midfield is virtually on top of its defence making a sort of  formation. Another instance would be in a highly attacking  formation not terribly common where the wing backs on either side of the midfield  are given few defensive responsibilities though the circumstances that demand such a formation are fairly rare. See Liverpool from  mins of the  Champions League Final. Im fairly certain Pep has used it from time to time with his Bayern team too though usually its use there is to break down defensive teams.A word on Italy theyve employed  at the back this tournament largely to replicate the defensive unit of ChielliniBonucciBarzagli at Juve that has dominated Serie A this decade. The system is made for the players rather than vice versa.,footballtactics,d4u5zzo,24,t5_2st3z
8174310,0,t3_4qmi38,It has to do with how full backs the wide defenders play in a  man defense. When their team is in possession full backs often move into forward positions down the flanks and that leaves only two defenders at the back making them vulnerable to quick counter attacks. When you add two wing backs to a three man defense which is almost always the case you really have a  man defensive line.,footballtactics,d4zc71q,1,t5_2st3z
8963140,0,t1_d7p6e2h,Thank you! Im glad you guys enjoyed the read I spent a ton of time putting it together. You know I was very fortunate to have great coaches like yourself from the sounds who addressed those points from a young age. But like you said its curious that it isnt wider taught or understood. ,footballtactics,d7p8gb5,4,t5_2st3z
