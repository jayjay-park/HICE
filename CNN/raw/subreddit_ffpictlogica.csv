8416067,0,t3_4ux2z1,This picture is a year old. Right when Record Keeper was at the peak of its hype. I couldnt get in the dungeon and given the team I have up in the corner I dont think I would have made it.,ffpictlogica,d5tjvdo,1,t5_37voe

9224775,0,t1_d8l99gs,Since youve beaten  and  stage you have Tamas special accessory which upgrades very nicely. I think the first upgrade requires  SSize things and the next two upgrades need  MSize things which can be made from the ssize. That upgraded fully gives Tama  attack  INT and then some. Then I would equip some magic for Tamas Intelligence slot since it has a high magic stat.Squall and Sabin cover your physical attackers and Tama your black magic then all you need is to build up a white mage job memoria guygirl in white hoodie for your healer and you will have a decent rounded team. I would try the  stage again after your guys are level III. You have plenty of time since this event has  days left.How many daily quests have you unlocked so far?,ffpictlogica,d8lb3ve,1,t5_37voe
9347524,0,t1_d905n0i,Thanks! In defense mode I remember getting nailed for  so I think it bypasses some defense.Ive tweaked my team and put in Kiros ninja Mustadio white hoodie Gilgamesh healer and black hoodie. This puts me at HP and  calcs. One trick I saw from the videos is that if the ninja doesnt get frozen it can cast magic the next turn making the boss defrost the other characters while causing about  damage. This resets his counter so you avoid the meteor but deal with freezing again.I got killed by the second boss since I couldnt inflict the fire weakness quick enough. Ill try again later but most likely skip this boss. Did you get the weapon?,ffpictlogica,d90v6jm,1,t5_37voe
9351478,0,t1_d91ch1j,Haha... if only.I dont think he has bad stats for a general sword fighter. When at max level stats are HP ATT INT SPD LUKIve built him up with chocobos and a couple of overfusions so the last stats exceed  and attack is around  depending on weapon and accessory Plus he has  Critical and Evasion without any equipment and a good premium skill. TBH Im pretty biased if you havent noticed.  ,ffpictlogica,d91d8mj,1,t5_37voe
9454356,0,t1_d9ed4ih,Alright I just did the math. In reality for some reason the actual best option is the . one. This is because it has a ratio of about  gems while the final package has a ratio of about  . So you get  more gems by continuously buying the . rather than choosing the one time large option.,ffpictlogica,d9eenfd,1,t5_37voe
9551264,0,t1_d9qcriw,Those are my picks but I expect theres a lot of room to choose a loadout.  Kefkas relevant because he hits well with wave so give him a dark one.  Minwu is worth bringing for a dedicated healer and his lv  holy should at least pass his protectreflect.  Youll likely need one depending on how much damage output you can do.  As Izusibiki found the best way to beat the boss is to keep pushing him through the phases.If you havent completed the KotR you should give it another try.  Its actually a pretty easy stage once you understand it I walked through it earlier for the two axes goal and had zero trouble now.  Dont even need to cure slowevidently is just kills their evasion so they cant dodge.  I dont bother curing it or bringing Lenna.  I grinded a ton of those blue gems over the last few days just because.,ffpictlogica,d9qe2d0,1,t5_37voe
9683088,0,t1_da6grlt,Thats a pretty good idea especially since Frimelda can use the Dragon Slayer anti aerial sword that I got with Ceodore. Tifas premium does the same thing as Layle side note Layle is one of my most wanted premiums. I am liking Noels premium skill to keep me in Break since theres lots of lowlevel throwaways that he can kill in a single strike.Have you run into the randomly appearing sorceresslooking boss yet? Looks like its going to be that one just like Bahamut I think? would randomly show up in the middle of the stages of the dragon mirage tower. The Sphinx boss absorbs earth just for what its worth. I havent tried  yet maybe once I burn out  and  rewards ,ffpictlogica,da6n87b,1,t5_37voe
9718399,0,t1_daazmvb,Neat never would have noticed it.  Animation is pretty meh it looks like he hurled a firecracker.  But yeah multihit that can be used from any position.  I wonder if it can be elemental based on the weapon.  Its probably anti air at least.,ffpictlogica,dab0525,1,t5_37voe
9739364,0,t3_5emb7a,Tyro but still not Tyros book.I played that stage so many times the first time and Id get a premium crystal every time.  I was one freaking item away from maxing his book at R.  I wish they would add some of the past limited items to the shop.,ffpictlogica,dadl84h,1,t5_37voe
9747601,0,t1_daelhip,I can set Quistis as my friend if you want to. Ive seen a lot of Squalls some Ultimercias a few Kiros and an Edea over the days.,ffpictlogica,daelre1,1,t5_37voe
9759849,0,t1_dag33v5,Sounds sweet. I want to draw from this selection to get Firion but I already have Shadow and his sword plus  of OKs. Now that you can upgrade Shadows sword to R it really makes it a good weapon. Hes my primary samurai. ,ffpictlogica,dag4bde,1,t5_37voe
9798704,0,t1_dakkhdc,Sweet waves at long last.Have you ever used the Youtube link on the right sidebar?  Thats really all I do when it comes to these.  Check videos of other people beating the stages look for a party thats similar to mine and replicate it.,ffpictlogica,dakwh49,1,t5_37voe

10456105,0,t1_dctaevm,Felt the same way when they finally repeated Tyro.  The first time I just could not get the materials to drop.  I played it countless times but kept getting his premium crystal.  When it ended I was one item from finishing his book.  I hung onto those things at least a year despite the waste of inventory hoping Id get another shot.  Then they finally repeated his event and no book.Though even at its best Triones sword is the weakest greatsword statwise.  It makes up for it for now thanks to the elements but who knows if it will ever be updated.  We still dont have R for general dark weapons.,ffpictlogica,dctayk4,1,t5_37voe
10543349,0,t1_dd35gvs,Sounds like I will. When I was in high school my brother got a PSP and I got a DS so thats partially why I stick to the nintendo handheld games. Plus I want to see how badgood the after years are. You can edit games on the PSP?,ffpictlogica,dd37fow,1,t5_37voe
10619441,0,t1_ddbb1lm,If they did more quests like use four gunslingers that would be great.  It would beat this lame equip negative stat rings on all five people and search desperately for a guest who has one.It seems odd to me they dont do more stuff like that.  They add these quests that last most of the month but with the one objective being to replay and collect.  Why not throw on like a dozen goals even if theyre for pretty basic rewards?   gold stamps if you beat it with instruments.  One black chocobo if you finish the high mdef boss with a spell.  K gil if you can do it under K HP.  An R crystal if you never EX break.  People would do it just for the hell of it.,ffpictlogica,ddbbcs0,1,t5_37voe
