11603633,0,t1_dga7dbq,Thats a really good question. I havent yet got a handle of how the team will perform but from the looks of it it looks like a pretty deep squad. However one thing I would really like to fix is how top heavy the team is with  CFC and  PF. Thats more than half of the team.If I fix this with a couple of good signings and solid draft picks I think we can make a deep run next year.Personally from all my other leagues Ive never been a GM who depended on the draft to rebuild a franchise. Theres some very decent pieces here like I said just a couple good signings off the free agency and adjusting the squad so its not so top heavy will improve the team drastically for next year. One thing I really like about the team is how much space we have in the cap as well. Ive also developed my own range of statistical indicators for signing Free Agents which has given me a lot of success over many franchises. I think it will work here too. Eventually well be able to make a serious run for the title with a couple of years Im very confident of the future.,BGASL,dgba4vo,1,t5_3fblu
