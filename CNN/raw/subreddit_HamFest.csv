428632,0,t3_1y3bhs,I had recently been looking at the same radio for my first and talked with my dad whos been a HAM since the s.  The following is what he sent me when I asked him about that particular radiogt heres my list in the order of preferencegt gt . Yaesu VXR  AES price . gt       Rugged and small. I have the original version of this radio the case is made of metal and the new ones are submersible.gt gt . Yaesu FTR AES price . gt       Not as rugged as the VXR but half the price still has lots of features.gt gt . Icom ICTA AES price . gt       Only problem these are closeouts so when they are gone they are gone other wise it would be gt gt . Kenwood THDA AES price . gt        Yea I know OUCH on the price but it has APRS built in translation to english if you add a wrist GPS unit to the radio it will automatically transmit your location to a APRS repeater and people can see where you are on the map via the web.gt gt If you want to go with a  meter only option which would save costgt gt .  Yaesu FTR AES price . gt        Built to commercial standards so it should hold up well.gt . Icom ICV HD AES price . gt        Good solid single band radio thats easy to use not loaded with so many feature you get lost trying to use the thing.gt . Icom ICV Sport AES price . gt         Same radio as above but made to run on AA batteries which comes in handy if youre out longer then the rechargeable battery last and its cheap.gt gt gt As far as the Chinese one like in your link they work they are cheap but they are still a bit rough around the edges compared to the Japaneses ones. I have a dual band one Wouxun and paid less then  for it. It works but its a bear to figure out how to do some of the functions on it. Owners manual didnt translate to English all that well. However give them some time and Im betting they will improve to be a good buy over the big  Japanese ones.Im actually looking at getting the BaoFeng UVR to use while backpackinghiking because if it gets damaged or lost no big worry and its still pretty smalllightweight.Im curious what lead you to want to pick this particular radio as your first? Im also new to participating instead of just being a spectator while my dad operates his radios. ,HamFest,cfp6ydf,3,t5_2trl5
