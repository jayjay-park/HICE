40467,0,t1_ceimi5i,i am a bit worried about this expansion.  Not only is the endgame weak because of Big Battles but Im worried that for the first time the expansion also ruined the rest of the game nonendgame.   Previously if you didnt like the expansion you could just level an alt and you could still have the same great experience of the earlier levels.  But now they have also ruined the earlier levels that made Lotro a great game by the trait revamp resulting in  obviously way overpowered characters and  forced cookie cutter skill builds.,lotro,cej1dqu,2,t5_2rfus
45831,0,t3_1umrx2,Theres so much to learn its hard to know where to start. Just play and see how it goes. The game is really good at introducing you to all different aspects of the gameworld. More advanced stuff you can google or consult lotrowiki.,lotro,cejnd2k,4,t5_2rfus
75894,0,t1_cen2fsp,Thanks! I used to be really into raiding before I left but I guess thats all changed now. Im not even sure if those instances are relevant anymore. Probably not.Do you think itd be hard to play solo? I really like group instances still and Id love to do them but I just dont know anyone who plays anymore. Is it hard to get a random fellowship going for something?,lotro,cen2i0o,1,t5_2rfus

190857,0,t3_1wajbc,Ill tell you from recent personal experience that running a kin by yourself will destroy this game for you. Ive stopped playing due to the fact I was the only officer really looking to better the kin. I was getting ready for new content so I was getting people up and running again recruiting making sure the new guys and gals were being treated fairly. Trying to work with the raid leader to start runs but all this was shot when Turbine said they werent working on any new end game. Not only that they still havent touche the housing and all the small content updates they were so eager about in the producers letter seems to be gone as well.  So be careful. On the other hand create kin events. Like a sparring contest where the winner can get a high end reward or money. Just use some creativity to get people talking and playing.My kin actually did a hide and go seek event in the hobbit homestead. I used my burg stealthed and people came to look for me. As time went on Id put out in kinchat a clue to where I was which made them home on to my location.,lotro,cf06fmj,10,t5_2rfus

295828,0,t1_cfbbrhz,If you want the total Tolkien immersion without the modern world intruding into your experience Laurelin is the place to be at.Warning though at times it can get very confusing in chat over there because most players have elvish numenorian and dwarvish names and it can be really hard to remember and spell a lot of the elvish names so global chat can be a bit of a homogenous gibberish name blur which can make sending ingame mail and tells difficult.Also note that the LOTRO character naming policy is VERY strictly enforced on Laurelin and you will get reported by other players and be force renamed by a GM to a random autogenerated Tolkieny name if your name violates LOTRO character naming policies names from pop culture internetty memey names names from historical people etc Other servers are much less strict on the character naming policy and you can get away with really hilarious ones,lotro,cfbffqk,2,t5_2rfus

774148,0,t3_2304k6,Mounted Combat    Procs from equipment or other sources no longer trigger when participating in Mounted Combat.    Fixed issues causing player weapons to not always display in combat while riding a warsteed.    The level  Mounted Combat runics have received a small boost.Monsterplay    Monsterplayers autoattacks deal Fellwrought or Orccraft instead of Common.    Fixed a variety of skills who were missing Orcraft damage and were dealing common still.    Black Arrows Enhanced Deathblossom now has a  second grace period on its snare. This fixing an issue with the damage from the skill cancelling it immediately.    Orccraft and Fellwrought damage should now properly pass through Physical Mitigations. Hovering over the stat in your character panel will display the amount at which is mitigated.    Additional mitigation given from audacity has been removed because of this change.    Fixed issue where Virulent Poisons Damage over Time effect was not being increased by the Weavers Venom Pips.    Creeps core virtue stat amounts base stats were significantly upgraded. This is to bring them more in line with their freep equivalents.    New armour is now available for level scaled Free people at the cost of Commendations.        This armour is available in bands of ten levels from level  to level . This armour will not be affected by any sort of offset throughout its level band. For example level  gear will remain level item level  until the player hits level .    Reavers Enhanced Skill Resilience was not properly applying immunity after using the skill. This should be fixed now.    Fixed issue with the effects of Charge not applying to the Reaver until the animation was completed.    Fixed issue with the Warg where equipping the trait Enhanced Skill Rallying Howl where the outgoing damage buff wasw not stacking and instead was applying the wrong effects to the warg.    Drink Deep heal should now be affected by Outgoing Healing and Tactical Mastery. Added a slight variance to it so its not the same heal every time.    Glan Vraig Reward Chests should now respawn more frequently after being opened.    The Mastery Boost Trait was not functioning correctly when all tiers of the trait were active. When all six are equipped  of the time when using harmful skills you will be able to use a skill free of power cost.    The armour set Armaments of Precision  piece bonus was not working and has been changed to have a  chance to grant  Focus every  seconds.    Power of the First Age effect granted to players who carry the Artifact no longer gives a  bonus to melee ranged and tactical defense. This has been replaced with a bonus to PhysicalTactical mitigation.    Resolved and issue with the tooltips of the level  Freep armour that was causing the  set bonus to be missing from the tooltip of certain gear sets.    Fixed issue with the Avoidance trait giving certain mp classes  block rating instead of .    Many MonsterPlay classs melee skills were converted to the new damage types along with many of their damage over time effects.    Fixed snares across Monsterplayers so that stronger snares always take higher priority over lesser snares.    Creep damage has been slightly bumped to compensate for the increase in defense with new damage types passing through physical mitigations for freeps.    The defiler has received some healing boosts and induction reductions.    Reduced the acid damage and stun duration of Burzthrang Marauders special attack Mirkwood region.Epic Battles Classic Raids amp Instances Skirmishes    The Flawed Symbol of the Elder King has been added as a rare drop to Tier  skirmishes and as a very rare drop to classic raid instances. This symbol is used to craft st Age legendary gear.    The Big Battle jewlery items which were set to unique recently are no longer unique. The jewelry and set names have all been renamed to make better sense for which pieces can be used in order to obtain the set bonus.    Flawed Symbol of the Elder King have a chance to drop from completing a Platinum Epic Battles Reward Bar at level .Erebor    Fires of Smaug  Valves should appear the same to all players    Assault on the Ringwraiths Lair  Moved entrance telepad out of aggro range of FaelathronHelms Dike    Added arrow buckets next to each archer that have the Load multiusage action on them. Players can load multiple arrows into the buckets and as long as a bucket has at least one arrow in it the archer will reload from the bucket. If the archer runs out of arrows in the bucket he will wait until new arrows are loaded into the bucket.    Added a Rohirrim Worker behind the gate on the ground level. Once the War Machine set the gate on fire the worker will patrol to the river with a bucket get water and return to the gate to douse the flames. The Rohirrim Worker can be given the Haste order to speed up his progress.    Point conditions have been modified on the gate to be slightly less severe.    Point conditions have been added to Rohirrim Archers being defeated    Point conditions have been added to the Rohirrim Worker being defeatedDeeping Wall    Gamling should no longer be holding a sword while using his bow    Moved a few Supply Crates and Healing Stores to more playerfriendly locations    The Assault on the East Tower  Raid  fixed a bug with enemy run speed which should make this secondary noticably more difficult    A Flanking Foe  Raid  Adjusted merit values for supply deliveries labourer defeat and cadet defeat    The Hornburg  The Final Blockade secondary    Ballistae should now show the correct damage percentage    Also all repairable interactives should how show a red bar to indicate the max repair threshold    Grappling hooks should now be destroyed when the wall is destroyed.    Fixed typos on some of the text related to the multiuser interface on catapults.    With the change to how Orccraft and Fellwrought damage is now mitigated by players via itemization the Arrow volley and Catapults in Big Battles now do increased damage. You can check your current mitigation amount towards these damage types by opening your character panel clicking Show All Stats and then reveal the tooltip info for Damage Type Physical under the Mitigations. The Engineer traits that increase your mitigation towards Orccraft and Fellwrought have not been changed.    The first  tiers of the Repair Contribution Trait for Engineers has been increased to make it more potent.    The Elf Hobbit and Dwarf Vanguards will now produce sounds when using their Big Battle skills.    Officer Rank  has changed slightly removing the  Build Contribution bonus and replacing it with a s to the banner cooldown time. This will allow Officers to immediately deploy a new banner when the old one has expired when the Banner Cooldown trait is fully ranked up.    The Officer trait Haste Order Strength has been fixed allowing Attack Duration to be correctly applied to soldiers.    Added requirement information to the Fire button on the catapult and ballista.    Interactives actions now respect your Move To Use setting Options gt UI Settings gt Move To Use.    Interactives contributing to mutuallyexclusive actions should be a bit more userfriendly. For example while aiming a Medium Catapult you are free to select Aim Left without first canceling an inprogress Aim Right as long as no other player has joined your Aim Right.Glittering Caves    Cave In  Timing of Gimli causing the cave in and the quest failing should be more in sync    Spider Assault  The secondary will now start a bit earlier allowing for more time to complete it.

Also the Expansion Quad Pack at  is better than the Expansion Triple Pack on Steam. Same price but you get more stuff.If you ever spend real money on LOTRO somehow your account gets upgraded from FP to Premium so if you buy anything from   or Steam LOTRO packs you become premium.To become VIP you must sign up for a monthly subscription. When your monthly subscription has elapsed your account gets downgraded from VIP to Premium. You can buy game time from the TurbineLOTRO Store or from time cards from brick and mortar stores like Walmart in the U.S. I think.Check out the links on the sidebar to see the differences in account types.Also check out the Gamestopexclusive Mithril Edition package  Very good value for money if its about US in your region!Cheers!,lotro,cguu1uy,7,t5_2rfus

2291186,0,t3_2l2ba7,As far as being new to MMOs I can relate. This was my first as well. Started about a year ago.I ended up scrapping my first toon. I went with a Hunter but being new to the MMORPG world I got so frustrated with trying to learn everything that I decided to go with a simpler DPS type. I went with Champion though Guardian is also pretty simple. Going through the starter content a second time helped me start getting up to speed.If you ever need help theres a Lotrowiki and forums where the question has probably already been answered. If you are on a more populated server there are usually people willing to give advice or to aid you in a quest.Once you get toward level  it may also help to join a kinship especially if you like fellowship instances and raids. The game is pretty good about staggering the availability of things to allow you to learn the game and your toon early on up to lvl . As far as freetoplay I would recommend playing up to about lvl  end of the LoneLands quests to see if it is what you like. If you like it and see yourself playing LotRO longterm paying for a month of VIP is a smart investment. It opens up tons of content and abilities for a small price.

2462004,0,t1_cmfz1p3,I generally disagree with this route and especially for new players. True newbies that are entirely freetoplay have no benefit to going Explorer unless they are looking to craft their own nonheavy armor for their own use. The why is simple they have no way to sell those nice crafting materials outside of the Trade Channel which is a bit more complicated in and of itself seeing as how few people actually pay attention to the Trade Channel and too many true noobs barely realize it exists. They have no Auction House slots available to fill with their goods for disbursement into the rest of the game. And even if they do get some coin back for their time spent they still have to contend with the gold cap of G. Nope. Recommending an actually useful profession for the class at hand is a much better option.

Currently for level  Dol Amroth and Pelargir both have traders for what at the moment is highest level gear.  Expect that to change shortly as Update  hits.You can Barter for gear with empty slots but then you have to grind to get the Essences you wantneed.  Most all of the gear you can acquire has one stat which Turbine has decided is a base stat for your class but it is not a big number and there is only one. You need certain rep to barter with the different traders and for different pieces of gear  no cash deals.

The big caveat though is that you can only use a scroll of delving on an imbued LI if you didnt use one before you imbue. And again you can only use one delving scroll per LI.Second there are no majorminor legacy distinctions on imbued LIs every LI can effectively be a major LI if you want with all legacies maxed.So my checklist identify and level to  add remembrance crystal change any legacies that I really want that I know wont cost me more than  scrolls in the end level to  add three starlit crystals if I have them imbue LI use delving scroll cry myself to sleep at the thought of needing  starlit crystals and insane numbers of empowerment scrolls across my  level  characters.,lotro,csdkv4w,2,t5_2rfus

4955133,0,t1_cuj47f8,Okay. There are things this game does better than any other game. It is a better researched and more sensitive adaptation of Tolkien than any other game. That alone is enough to make it the very best Tolkien game in the opinion of its devoted fanbase despite dated graphics and repetitive mechanics.OP can make any vid he wants but I dont have to snooze through a playthrough by someone who doesnt even like the game.If you are interested in a discussion of the games strengths and weaknesses as an adaptation I suggest you watch the ongoing LotRO playthrough by Corey Olson the socalled Tolkien prof and a legit Tolkien scholar. He spends his traveltime ingame answering fan questions about Tolkien lore and certainly doesnt give the game a free pass though its safe to say he likes it.Seriously even if youre annoyed with me and think Im a dick if youre looking for a playthrough to watch Olsons is worth a look its a good one and more interesting than most if youre into Tolkien lore game design games as art etc.,lotro,cuj4v0g,2,t5_2rfus

5328175,0,t1_cvshehi,Do it just do it.  Once you have you will also understand why people come to LOTRO and stay for years.  Also try to follow up with The Silmarillion which is kind of a history of Middle Earth from the beginning of time through the earlier ages leading up to the LOTR era the Third Age.  It is a hard book but will fill in depths about the history of Middle Earth with a kind of scope far beyond anything you thought you were able to imagine before.  Its staggering right down to beginning with a hauntingly beautiful creation story.  Tolkiens  books are an unprecedented peak in fiction regardless of being called fantasy genre.I chimed in under the subject of go read the books because that is really where you should start.  But the game is astoundingly good.  If you can forgive the way questing has predictable repetitive mechanisms gather N of object X kill N of enemy Y talk to person P etc. the story arc developed in the game is still miles deep worthy of months to years of play depending on your pace and requiring multiple toons to fully explore.The digital Middle Earth is a stunning piece of art so large and beautiful that your jaw will drop repeatedly you will gasp at the sight of it now and then you will be awe struck to be there and will feel compellingly like you are there in person.  There are lots of players whos favorite aspect of the game is exploring.  Its not so huge you cant learn the whole map but its just big enough that even as a very skilled map head in real life with photographic memory I can get turned around and lost in the forests of LOTROs Middle Earth.  And forests there are in plenty the game is a rare treat for feeling wild and sometimes empty and desolate it is not cramped and it is not completely tamed there are many places with paths instead of roads.  If there are other game worlds anything like as good I would love to hear about them I have not explored any other MMOs but nobody tells me I need to and I do say you need to explore Middle Earth.In closing LOTRO is a real work of art a worthy creation that is worth your time IF you are captivated by the books and IF you find you enjoy the game for what it is.  I suggest it is not a top notch MMO in all the ways you were looking for the game has many flaws and you will feel them.  But it is worth the experience for its own sake and it is worth spending the money on if you can afford it.,lotro,cvsqi3a,1,t5_2rfus

6733355,0,t3_47tfrv,Go Through Paths of the Dead  via the epic Storyline safest bet there is and Gondor will begin kitting you via quests with appropiate level gear to do overland questing.Endgame these days is mostly around collecting Essences and tailoring your Armor to your liking regarding stats but for regular overland PvE most normal non slotted pieces off quests and tier  named sets from skirmishes will do. To be honest you can enjoy pretty much all of Gondor with non essence gear as I did with my minstrel which is using teal gear still with some pieces off Helms Deep  so dont fret about it until you really really feel you need that extra push which will only be needed for raiding same with Imbued Legendary weapons which will you unlock at level  and sloooowly begin to mould to your liking too. Endgane is practically full personalization of kit to your playstyle instead of generic gear templates.Just play through do all the overland Gondor Quests along the Epic Storyline and once you reach Minas Tirith you will have a clearer vision of what you want to do alongside decent yellowteal quested gear.To give you a perspective I do regular level  skirms with what could be considered level  gear no problems. Dont fret about it I repeat this because I have met some players that go crazy for the essence gear and they rarely raid or PvP if at all  where the extra   increase in resistsdps is actually quite noticeable.,lotro,d0fsd7y,2,t5_2rfus

We are approaching Moria and the beginning of legendary weapons.  Ive been going spear all the way so far.  There any reason to switch?  Im guessing when we do legendaries Ill likely pick one type and stick with it?Im going to guess a lot has changed from ish when we did Moria last time.  Hell the level cap is  higher now.  On my burglar I had no idea what I was doing with my legendary weapon.  I got one mostly upgraded the DPS on it.  Then by  or so I swapped out the level  weapon for a  one since it had higher DPS to start with and presumably a higher level cap? and continued with that.  The system is complicated.

So for example an item might only be obtainable through a particular quest or by purchase from a vendor gated by reputation.  Once you have it however any of your characters can use it cosmetically via the wardrobe even if they dont meet the level class or reputation criteria.The AH is a good place to shop for interesting appearance items since level and rep dont matter for equipping cosmetically through your bank wardrobe.  There are also a number of appearance items available through the LotRO ingame store purchased with Turbine Points.Good luck with downloading the game client.

7057489,0,t1_d1fjdc6,Overall I wouldnt worry too much anything other than building up IXP until you get near level  and can start thinking about imbuement. Any legendary weapon will quickly become obsolete as you gain levels as higher level weapons will always have higher DPS. Keep your LI slots filled and keep earning XP. You can use some of the runes on your active LIs to keep them powerful. My advice about waiting to level  to have your pick of legacies only applies if you dont plan on leveling and want to do a lot of content onlevel. And as far as imbuement goes you dont have to worry about that until level . At that point there are a few guides out there that talk about the most efficient ways to imbue. ,lotro,d1gbql9,1,t5_2rfus

To actually display these higher Frame rates you need a  or  FPS monitor.The latest and greatest  K and K monitors have nothing to do with frame rate but with the number of pixels per frame.There are many ongoing debates about the net effects of higher Frame Rates. The human eye can only perceive at a certain rate which varies by individual just as the ability of a human eye to perceive the difference between the image taken by a Film camera and that of a Digital camera  some people can tell most cannot.Movies television and computer game grahics all depend upon the percistance of vison to smoothe the image.As for your laptop  If you are running on an Apple Laptop there have been many issues with the fans and their control. Many PC laptops have been called sterilizers because they normally run far to hot to hold on your lap without doing damage. In general both have design issues that cause these problems and the only viable solution turns out to be prop the device up on a ramp which contains built in fans and never run the system when the ambient air tempereature exceeds  degrees ,lotro,d2gg9il,-2,t5_2rfus

At  start Vol. II with the prologue at The Last Homely House which takes you to the Walls of Moria to get your first two legendary items.  Then quest Moria and Mirkwood or Enedwaith instead and Isengard or Great River instead.  At  get your warsteeds from the first settlement in northern Rohan Wold.  Epics through Wildermore then everything in Helms Deep for all the skill trait points there.Join groups for instances in Moria whenever the opportunity comes up they are fun and teach stuffmechanics you want to know.,lotro,d2j6dkn,1,t5_2rfus

Or even gathering ore wood etc.  You can do a lot with farmingcooking...At level  give or take you can start the questchain that opens up moria.  That takes a bit and does not require purchase.  However Moria itself and beyond are expansions sold separately.  Folks often go for the Quadpack.Theres also public dungeons like Sarnur near Thorins Hall or Goblin Town in Misty Mountains.  But they tend to be around level  mobs.  Still Sarnur is popular for the Thorins faction items they drop.  Kindred with Thorins lets nondwarves ie manhobbitelf trade some of those Thorinsfactionraising items for a reusable port to Thorins Hall.  Much like how Kindred in LoneLands gets you a faction port there.  Theres also one in Bree for nonraceofman dwarfelfhobbit with Breefactionraisingitems.By your s if you are doing deeds you should have a fair bit of TP saved up.  You can also delete a character and restart it to repeat TP deeds if you really want to.  A zone will set you back  TP but there are often sales of  to  off.Subscribers get the quests in the level  zones while subscribed.

8284180,0,t1_d5d2w1e,Also  keep in mind that LOTRO has players world wide and we dont all earn our incomes in currencies that have favorable exchange ratings to the dollar. We have to hunt bargains because we pay rather more than you do at the same price. In my case  roughly  times more. So  apiece on sale would have cost me just about half the monthly instalments on my Audi A ! I did buy the quadpack and helms deep during the steam summer sale  but I had time to budget for it and even then I would not have done it outside the sale period. Now that steam has local currency pricing that helps too  the local currency pricing is often a bit less than the actual exchange rate which is one reason they got stingy about international gifting  so people cant use that difference to cheat the system.,lotro,d5d2y6p,2,t5_2rfus

8322423,0,t3_4thmjj,By CordovanWe know that our Middleearth is a big place and that sometimes getting around can be a bit perplexing. While we love the visual appeal of our world map there can be times you want to understand where youve been and where you want to go.   Not sure if you ever made it to The Wold in your run of Rohan? Weve got you covered. Wondering exactly where Maur Tulhau is and what it connects to? Yeah you can do that. Wish to simply admire the clean constellation of places you have quested and explored on a single map? Here you go. And of course if youve just got to go there now you can do that too. Think of this Collection as the map on your wall over your desk a pushpin for every stable found. But lets back up for a moment. You may have noticed the Collections system quietly growing in its corner of our UI over the last several updates. With the recent Emotes Collection we felt like we were starting to hit our stride. As we began looking around for other information that would be cool and interesting to show we hit on the idea of Stablemasters and we immediately knew we were on to something different.  Pro tip you can search by region name as well as by stablemaster location name. Furthermore the idea of showing all discoverable stablemasters provided a reason to try something several of us had been itching to do for a while portray the full map of Lord of the Rings Online in its actual gameworld proportions laid out over the greater landmass of Middleearth. This meant going in and getting the computer equivalent of aerial snapshots of every region then stitching them together. Once stitched we were able to forge an artistic rendering that if we do say so ourselves looks pretty all right.  But enough about how and why. Lets talk a bit about what the Stablemaster Collection is. Well to begin with there are just over  stablemaster locations in Lord of the Rings Online and counting of course and they paint a pretty great map of where youve been and what youve done.  The search bar searches by location name and by region name Major travel nexuses are marked with capital icons When selected stablemaster locations highlight connected stablemasters Convenience travelformithril for both discovered and undiscovered locations Undiscovered locations in new content are not available for travel this way. A button on the world map takes you to the Stablemaster Collection Each location has another button that takes you to that spot on the world map Travel to undiscovered locations for new content is turned off while it is new. Wed like you to find those Stablemasters for yourself! ,lotro,d5hux8d,1,t5_2rfus

Youll have to transfer them to a new server before you can play.If you dont have your same old master userpass then I guess youll just have to wait for the ticket support.  It might take a bit but I cant imagine you not getting your account and toons back.Tip you can also go make new toons on the new server before you transfer.  If you want to rename any of your existing toons make a new toon with the same name on the new server youre transferring to.  You dont even have to play through the intro just create the toon until youre in world and exit the game.  Now when you relaunch go into transfer and move your old toon it will get a  put on the end of its name and you will get a rename credit.

Low levels are intended to be slower and clunkier so brand new MMO players can slowly adjust and increase their speed of combat as they level. At higher levels its much more fluid. Edit Also make sure your graphics arent too high. Try toning them down in combat a few times. When I came back to the game I was wondering why it seemed laggy in combat but once I toned the graphics quality down it helped tremendously. Edit  Heres a couple gameplay videos.

9614846,0,t3_5cg060,In a word. No. Turbine has always been an independent developer of LOTRO. That said remember however that both the MMO and the movies are based on the same intellectual property of JRR Tolkien. And both have adapted the original works to fit the needs of their respective media. This means that there are similarites and differences between print movie and online game.Similarly over the years there have been MANY independent artists producing LOTR inspired works which have had nothing to do with Peter Jackson  the brothers Greg and Tim Hildebrant being two well known Fantasy and Science Fiction artists who produced the s Tolkien Calendars.  Tolkien himself illustrated the original Hobbit.And dont forget very few artists work for anyone other than themselves  that is to say they do contract work for anyone who will hire them.

9679616,0,t3_5dosaf,I dont know any guides like that but the things that comes first to my mindPlayers who just started have access to quests in Ered Luin The Shire Breeland and The Lone Lands. Itd be a good idea to wait till you get to another area like The North Downs where you cant do any quests without being VIP or buying the quest pack with TP.Before subscribing create all characters that you want and level them to . While VIP go to Hengstacer Farm and talk to ogar to complete a quest that gives you the riding skill saving you TP per character.This one is trickier and probably unfeasible because youd need to be higher level to gather all materials necessary or it might work in case you get a longer subscription there are crafting guilds which you can join. From a tier onward you need to buy access to each crafting guild with TP or be a VIP.

The gambit memorization is the hard part because they all do something different.  a cheat sheet will help on that though.  The one that that i can say about my  warden is i can hardly stand to play it at this point because of the scream for the fist skill.Learning to use your mastery skills is essential and figuring it out isnt real hard but hotkeying them can be a real PITA.I would say my problem with warden is the Scream and Hotkeys for masteries.it is a LOT of fun to get  mobs on you then use your moral taps then go into full turtle mode with your safeguard line before going back to moral taps to refresh the hots.  You can literally clean house with a warden and walk away with full health after you figure it out.If i could ONLY turn off the sound for the fist skill hehe.  in honesty i cannot play a DPS mini or Cappy any longer either.,lotro,danya9c,1,t5_2rfus

If someone is the sort of obsessive who is able to stay awake while reading The Silmarillion then nothing short of the devs transporting them to Bree itself will be good enough. Since youve yet to finish the trilogy Id say the game will be close enough for you.gtAre there any parts that are just made up?The entire Your Character and Everything You Do thing. Even Horn has more legit standing in the game than you do if you go by lore. But if your character wasnt the unofficial tenth member of the fellowship would you play it?I would. But just because I liked the wandering around Eriador parts of the game more than the parts where Aragorn trusts you to get things done more than he does The Grey Company and the sons of Elrond.In the end I do think that the devs have managed to strike a good balance between staying faithful to the source material and producing a playable video game.,lotro,dbj3a4f,1,t5_2rfus

10983754,0,t3_5wqac3,LOTR is a very story driven RPG which is what I enjoy.  Its not all about ganking other players or powergaming like ESO seems to be.  The PVP is actually good because you play orcs and even wargs!Its also quite faithful to the world of Middle Earth so this is the best way to visit all those iconic locations from the books.Downsides are that it is a fairly old game.  It still looks rather good but it depends on what youre used to.  Its age means that most good names are taken as well.  Also it can be a bit grindy on occasion.But its the only MMO that I play these days because it is the best!,lotro,decz28s,2,t5_2rfus

11191070,0,t3_5zrm25,Depends on your play styles.For leveling purposes you can really duo anything with success  just when you reach instances  dungeons  group quests you may need a different composition or extra muscle.I found when leveling and focusing on just questing the more DPS the better  Champion  Hunter duos do great Champ  Champ One champ can even tank If one of you likes to tank more then the other Guardian Warden and champion all do very well with just about anything they have good sustain in any questing situation.If one of you likes to heal then literally the other can play anything Minstrel and Rune keeper matches up with anything and Ive even seen duo minstrels reek havoc.My personal favorite composition so far leveling was Captain and Loremaster together. First off both classes are a beat unique as most people play the heavy DPS classes since most people like to dish damage but when it comes down to technical play  I love both classes. They each have a pet  herald that assists them in battle making it so that even though its just the two of you  there is really four for that extra damage output especially the loremasters Lynx hits like a damn truck!Play the classes you typically enjoy in any other game and I guarantee you your composition will work well and you will really love the game the lore is deep and if you follow the book quests you will find yourself immersed in Middle Earth. Tip Pick different crafting of course  One can make armor one makes weapons you guys will be set. ,lotro,df0htcx,2,t5_2rfus
11204388,0,t1_df1q8gy,While I havent played that version myself I have it on good authority that the feel of the original Moria was pretty much ruined by adding all the lighting.The tales of getting lost are probably from the time before that change as well as the reason for it.I hate that I couldnt see the original because thats how Moria should be like. The welllit and overly crowded thing it is now just isnt right.,lotro,df204f1,4,t5_2rfus

11377098,0,t1_dfjinvm,I think the major thing they will ask you is if you have access to your old email address which was a hang up for my wife. She started over but it hasnt been too bad because she had about the same stuff you had. Check out this thread for how to get the most bang for your buck. Also the anniversary event is next month April and the quad pack is supposed to go on sale which gives you  expansions including Moria for . ,lotro,dflkpvd,2,t5_2rfus
11457572,0,t3_63jsmq,Capt and Guards both dont have the dps output to be a damage dealer in truly challenging content at level . For everything else theyre ok. So until you hit  and start gearing up it doesnt matter. You will have enough damage output to quest comfortably. And at  it still doesnt matter because no matter how you gear a CaptGuard will never be taken as damage dealer at current balance numbers.,lotro,dfuphn6,2,t5_2rfus
11486574,0,t3_63xrwa,Welcome to Lotro!gt Basically how essential is spending some money in this game?Lotros FP model is much more like an unlimited trial than a traditional FP game in that you have access to a nice crosssection of all the content quests deeds skirmishes player housing etc. but once you get to level  youll start to run out of quests. Youll still have your epic quest line and you can still roam the overworld freely but to access more content you have a few options. Purchase VIP to access nonexpansion content  Purchase quest packs individually  Grind out deeds achievements to purchase the quest packs you need with the premium currency you earn. The last option is a bit of a grind as a heads up.During the sales you can pick up most of the games content for around  the Quad Pack and the Helms Deep expansion and we should be seeing some sales pretty soon. Possibly during the th Anniversary but definitely during the summer sales.Hope that helps!,lotro,dfy02kp,5,t5_2rfus

11738303,0,t1_dgpyd7b,I agree about mounted combat. I mostly disagree about Epic Battles. The battles themselves arent always that bad they are really just another type of instance with a few mechanical differences. The problem with Epic Battles is they never explained them. They threw you into it and were all like oh heres this thing use it and yeah youre good. No good maps no good explanation of how you get ranked on your tasks. Nada. Just dropped on you to figure it out. Thats the problem. Once its figured out they are actually rather easy.,lotro,dgqkenh,5,t5_2rfus
