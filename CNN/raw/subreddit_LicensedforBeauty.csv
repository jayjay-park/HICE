99344,0,t1_ceppse4,I have always been told to not use glycerinrich products on brokeout prone skin. Glycerin creates a barrier on your skin. While that is great for protectingmoisturizing if you have sensitive andor dry skin for acne this is a problem because it can trap the oil in your pores and doesnt allow your skin to breathe. ,LicensedforBeauty,cepqo82,2,t5_2zo0d

252223,0,t1_cf33pri,Regular hand soap is very harsh on skin and can strip your skin of its natural oils. You should always have a bit of oil on your face since that is what helps keep your skin soft. So because the hand soap is taking away all the oils your skin is over producing to make up for it. I hope that makes sense? I would recommend sticking with a good face wash and grab a toner if you can. Toner will help your skin get its PH levels figured out and that may help the oil problem as well. ,LicensedforBeauty,cf6wbbn,1,t5_2zo0d
