3122931,0,t1_col9igx,Name of product SR Skincare Vitamin C Serum   Price of product . for ml  Where did you purchase SR Skincare website  Product claims Topical Vitamin C must be in the form of Lascorbic acid to be useful to the body and skin. Just because a product says Vitamin C on the label doesnt mean the product contains Lascorbic acid. Often manufacturers state Vitamin C on the label without stating the concentration. To be effective a product should contain a concentration of at least .  In creams lotions and serums the Vitamin C oxidises quickly and loses its therapeutic potency. If you buy a product containing Vitamin C off the shelf it is likely to have lost its effectiveness. We now add Ferulic Acid to our Vitamin C products because Ferulic Acid has the wonderful ability to stabilise Vitamin C thus ensuring it retains its potency. We also now add Vitamin E acetate to the serum.  About you Early s easily dehydrated and dry skin. Looking to keep skin looking bright and full as well as even out tone and texture.  Your opinion Will update after I have finished the bottle currently only  weeks in once a day use.  Its certainly not of your average serum consistency its  a lotion stored in a small pump bottle. Its a funny consistency when you first apply the lotion it feels and looks like there is no way it will absorb into your skin but with a bit of rubbing in it easily does. Im likely to finish it within the two months recommended. It smells odd vinegary but this dies down after I apply the rest of my routine. Its housed in a far more hydrating base than other LAA serums I have tried which is a big selling point for me. Results wise? Im not sure its definitely not instantaneous like the Active Formulas or OST serum but Im beginning to think that was just down to their exfoliating action.
