2806747,0,t1_cnn3ugp,gt Just make sure that your garage is secure and the car has an immobiliser or similar.Thanks.  That made me laugh.  Unless they bring  new tires it isnt likely to roll away.What Id really like to find is someone who will restore it and take care of it like I used to.  Id love for it to go back home as the previous owner was from the UK and restored it with at least a few parts he picked up on trips back home.As for the guy he hasnt called back so the old girl is likely to sit around for at least a little while longer.,littlebritishcars,cnn49rf,1,t5_2wtwr
3514991,0,t3_30hr75,I had this problem too. Checked the carbs and they were fine after i rebuilt them and it had the same problem. Turns out that although my alternator would read fine for voltage it didnt have enough amperage to run the coil for very long especially if i was using anything else in the car. I did a chevy  wire distributor swap. It was really easy. A little spacing at the bottom and a cut down alternator bracket off the chevy for the top. Solved my problem. And bonus points for now being able to use the windshield wipers without the headlights cutting out which is nice in washington state.,littlebritishcars,cpsxno9,2,t5_2wtwr

4549082,0,t3_3dd026,Im almost exactly the same size as you. Feel very comfortable in my spitfire  but it is a close fit.Ive had the opportunity to sit in a few different lbc. The MGB had the most interior room by far. IMO the styling and lines of the spitfire are well worth sacrificing a little bit of cabin width.,littlebritishcars,ct41aql,3,t5_2wtwr

8353011,0,t3_4tzwjn,I dont have experience with the specific product line your dealing with but I am a professional finisher industrial painter. Generally fillers and filling primers tend to be a bit porous. The best thing to fill and seal that porosity tends to be an epoxy primer without that epoxy after filler youll just be shooting paint over it to fill.  Their system sounds about right but I tend to prefer and etching primer first. You could fill right on the bare metal thus skipping the initial epoxy but clean sanded metal really should be treated within  hours. Bear if mind the epoxy doesnt need to be thick especially if you putting a filling primer over it. I wouldnt think youll need much more than a gallon of epoxy on a mgb. Filling primer on the other hand tends to have horrible coverage maybe get two gallons. I hope this helped.,littlebritishcars,d5logvv,2,t5_2wtwr
