10019157,0,t3_5iq1ds,So far my favorites that I ran are Sailors Doom and Frozen. Im planning to run The Meat Grinder in the future and probably Broodmother Skyfortress. The first is fanmade stuff the latter is originally for LotFP but its vibe fits the DCC mentality well.My favorite memory is from running Frozen in Time at a con. The partys sorceress charmed the yeti at the entrance. Later she blew herself up by putting a bolt in a laser gun and trying to fire it. The yeti ran down to the sound of explosion and found his friend dead. I decided the player could continue playing with the mourning yeti. The others agreed gave him the katana the hoplite shield and put the gothic armor on him somehow and continued with the adventure. When escaping another PC died when the yeti slipped and fell on him. Good times!,dccrpg,dbdiw4j,2,t5_2u1dw
