11711616,0,t3_66z6oo,Hi COEN student here with friends in both CS and COEN. COEN is in the school of engineering so if youve applied and been accepted to the school of arts and sciences youd need to apply to transfer schools. Im not sure exactly how this happens but its based on your interestsacademics and recommendations from faculty. Since coen is in the school of engineering you have to do the engineering core. Math  calculus phys  calculus physics math discrete math linear algebra amth differential equations engineering statistics. You are likely set for your language requirement  years hs and advanced writing happens for your senior design project. Theres a very detailed plan you can find on the website google cse  year plan. Engineering lets you double dip basically every class if you can find one thats offered also. CS follows the arts and science core which Im less familiar with but no physics requirement is a big one. They have different intro to coding tracks too. Engineering has coen  and CS has csci. Coen starts with C programming and eventually into C once you fundamentally understand data structures and algorithms. In the CS classes I know they start with C for the object oriented approach quicker. They both share coen which are logic design and assembly for embedded applications. They give you fundamentals for understanding the hardware youre dealing with.From there its in to your upper divisions where either coenCS can basically take either departments classes just check for your requirements. Its up to you what you specialize in from there data science information assurance robotics software engineering etc are all fields you can get into with an under grad degree and the right classes and all of the ones I mentioned are masters tracks at SCU.Hit me up if you have more questions ,SCU,dgnjhsp,3,t5_2s8yh
