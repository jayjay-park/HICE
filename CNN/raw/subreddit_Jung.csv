1254677,0,t1_ciagind,gt This bloodshed strengthened our genes and gave us our minds bodies and morals.gt We have not only competed against the forces of nature but against our fellow humans for survival and procreation.What I am saying is that we were born from violence and we are in a sense nature.gt Furthermore competition in an evolutionary sense is not necessarily the same as violence.Violence is a method albeit far from an ideal method. Violence is possibly slowly being rooted out by natural selection and by our minds which have the potential to speed up this process. Symbiosis is ideal in comparasin to parasitism or competition. Violence is an inevitable choice if a creature is taken over by its instictual drive shadow or a better alternative is not realized.gt Also the idea that bloodshed gave us our minds bodies and morals simply isnt a defensible position. What evidence do you have to support such a statement?We have violent histories and our violent histories shaped us. Granted they were only a small part but a part none the less. There is no moral right and wrong or good and evil from the natural view. Violence is not evil it is innefective. Violence is innefective in promoting our lives and the lives of others. Because violence is innefective we by nature and because of nature abhor it. If violence was effective we would embrace it more fully.gt So one cant really argue that competition somehow plays a more important role although cooperation both within a species and with others within the ecosystem has been shown to be a factor in general survivability and ability to adapt.I almost agree. The stronger the pressures of natural selection are the more quickly the better adapted species thrive. There would have to be some sort of optimal level of violence in order for humans to survive. Completely passive groups would have been wiped out by more aggresive humans. Groups that were too aggrisive would themselves have gotten wiped out by other groups banding together.Also the rate of suicides for US Service Members is closer to approximately  a day.Also Id like to say I think were almost on the same page here and were straining gnats. I am very much appreciating the conversation though.edit adding a bit to this... Our feelings towards violence come from our evolutionary background. We evolved both drives for and against violence. The word feeling feeling tone is critical to this discussion. Violence is to be expected but avoided. I recommend checking out the book Blank Slate by Steven Pinker.,Jung,ciarlft,1,t5_2s5nh
1893428,0,t1_ckh1jlh,gt     Has anyone else had the experience while travelling or stumbling down the rabbit hole of discovery within this realm of thought that they are flirting dangerously with madness?gt gt There is a big difference between synchronicity and paranoid delusions or ideas of reference. Yes and no. There is a big grey area. One mans synchronicity can be anothers delusion. It all depends on the perspective. Ive had moments where I felt myself wondering if I was going insane with some synchronicities.,Jung,ckhckc9,2,t5_2s5nh
3191961,0,t3_2wosg7,Having recently combined gnostic thought and taoiststoic leanings I thank you for this. A new thread for me to pull at. Have you listenedread any of Manly P Hall?,Jung,cosuhkh,3,t5_2s5nh
5156962,0,t1_cv5vo44,So you disagree respectfully with Dual in that the ego is NOT an archetype. You are saying that the ego is one aspect of the self whereas the shadow the anima and animus are are archetypes? I thought all three were archetypes through which the self expresses itself.,Jung,cv7lu6l,1,t5_2s5nh
6224685,0,t3_3zzabw,I wouldnt fall for this.unless you go to a Jungian Analysis for years Id say the only way to learn is to self teach.this course seems like the ordinary internet marketing type membership program.  where the shit is already scripted out to drag you in and keep you coming back for more as long as you keep subscribing.  Most likely just bullshit theyve already well thought out and weaved into the story in order to build a perception of value all the while they just drip feed you content through some automated email or member access program..just invest the money in reading there are no shortcuts.  Professional analysis not a damn seminar or collective course would probably help but I doubt most of us can afford it longterm.the most youll learn here is someone elses interpretation of Jungs work which as I understand his work seems opposite of what he would recommend doing.  if anyone at all is involved in helping you it would have to be a personal approach not a podcast prerecorded videos nor emails.  ,Jung,cyx6gb2,3,t5_2s5nh

7107692,0,t3_4cne5f,To understand anxiety I turn to the Buddhists. They say that anxiety is worry that is not being addressed. People have legit worries. Right now Im worried that my girlfriend has exhausted herself and opened herself up to illness. I can help by taking some of the load off of her and making sure she eats well today. Anxiety is produced by either a. not addressing something that is worrying you or b. not accepting it. Some things cant be changed they just have to be accepted.,Jung,d1m16ri,2,t5_2s5nh
7212657,0,t3_4cxtz6,I was first introduced to many of Jungs theories through Persona  and I think its a perfect starting point for those interested in seeing a great deal of Jungs work represented in a compelling and quite thorough believe it or not context. I often jokingly refer to it as Carl Jung The Video Game because it wears a lot of its Jungian influence on its sleeve in fact theres even a point where the characters all but namedrop Jung and even acknowledge that his concept of the Persona is rather different than that portrayed within the game. Furthermore in the updated rerelease Persona  Golden for the Playstation Vita theres a series of short lectures that can be unlocked which provide a basic outline of many of Jungs theories. If youre looking for an introduction to Jung PG is definitely a great place to start.Whereas Persona  is Carl Jung The Video Game Persona  might well be called Existentialism The Video Game as it features many references to Nietzsche and Camus. Although some Jungian symbolism is obviously present its not the primary motif at play. Still its a pretty good interpretation of Jung in the context of existentialism and definitely worth checking out as well.Im not as familiar with the first two Persona games though I do know that dream psychology and the collective unconscious play a big role in both. Theres even a character named Philemon that guides the player character throughout the course of the game. But thats pretty much all I know about those two games.,Jung,d1y0u6b,2,t5_2s5nh
7541896,0,t3_4igapu,Probably best not to consider Jungs views on homosexuality.Times were too different than.Any thought Jung had on homosexuality was probably wrong. I remember there was once something like an overcompensating animus or something like that which is just sillyThe interesting thing is to apply this to modern thinkers. That a very intelligent man could be wrong about something back then because of the times... I wonder what intelligent men today are wrong about something.Makes me be more critical to all wisdom,Jung,d2zh6sp,3,t5_2s5nh

8937719,0,t1_d7d38xn,gtAnd they dont understand his ideasYeah. And if you do understand his ideas..well the profundity and significance of them is self evident.Personally Jungs ideas have helped me understand myself and others more than any other set of theories or methods although it is certain methods specifically that have helped me become more emotionally free and balanced and those werent strictly Jungian but were interwoven inclusive of a Jungian framework.,Jung,d7m6jzz,2,t5_2s5nh

9854445,0,t1_darrvcu,Great book but its way too deep for a beginner. Red Book is graduate work. It was never meant for public consumption. Jung wrote it as a journal of his personal journey deep into dreams and the unconscious mind. It was published decades later as a supplement for understanding the man and his work.,Jung,das224l,1,t5_2s5nh
10556931,0,t3_5pcu29,Yes I really like the work theyve done at PEAR. Apparently each of us has a signature way in which we shift random number generators. It does speak to the overlap between mind and matter though how to explain it is still a mystery I think.,Jung,dd4qx4p,2,t5_2s5nh
10870161,0,t3_5v7vhg,Well repressing them will only make the shadow stronger like repressing day dreaming will only make the unconscious more intrusive in your life.Shadow material especially anima energy mixed up with the shadow is much more complex than you might think. These knots cant be untied with the intellect alone because they were tied via experience and emotions rather than anything thought out. What i see you doing alex time and time again is approaching these things with a very balanced intellect and thats great! But we gotta feel these things rather than figure them out alone. This is the main challenge of the anima on the masculine ego. Really sit on that one. We have to feel this energy out not just decipher it.The question becomes how can we work with this shadow and anima material and where does it come from? Lets look at the shadow material you put forward. You made a program to warn parents that these kids might be confused and on the wrong tracks and it was your parents who were confused and put you on the wrong track. I want to challenge you to sit down and explore how you feel about your parents fuck up. And they fucked up pretty hard. Let your self feel that anger seriously really jump into it. Of course lashing out at them wont do you or them any good but you intellectualizing what you went through as if to pasifiy and get over it wont help either. Allow your experiences to have some real weight. Feel for that past alex who was just a kid and was put through this program. If you wont feel for him who will? I have a feeling this is something you havent seriously attempted. In my experience if your comfortable with it attempting to explore this with your S.O. may help the process come up given the strong anima pull.Anyway this is something i do a lot this intellectual understanding bs as my parents fucked up pretty hard too. Things like jungs work are a blessing and a curse. It allows us to understand what causes others to do what they do and in turn allows us to understand how complex life is. While this is great for intellectual types we tend to leave it at that. We become all contemplation intellectual understanding but emotion is left out. And emotions arent always pretty. They arent rational and clean cut. They are messy and filled with unbridled passion. The pride and understanding of the intellects ethics is at times very atagonistic to the emotions. And trust me alex were much more emotion than we are the intellect.,Jung,de16h8a,4,t5_2s5nh
