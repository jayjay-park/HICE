7190618,0,t3_4dw6om,. During a certain part of the game its definitely mentioned that Monarch developed weapons that are stutterproof. From what I recall you only ever pick up guns from Monarch employees so that would make sense.. When he went back to  he then lived in the shadows and built up Monarch to . So thats why later on he has grey hair and seems older and in the very beginning of the game in  you meet with the original Paul at the university and he seems much younger and doesnt have grey hair.,quantumbreak,d1vige4,1,t5_2xbd5

7214611,0,t1_d1y1av0,Must say where Im from gears ultimate is  while qb is  and its shocking how much values gears hassure gears came for PC months later so aint fair to compare while sp wise both are about the same lenght gears has a insain amount of mp maps and since this is pc were talking about no gold sub needed and we got early access to the beta for gears on xbone before gold subs do a few days later and I assume we wont need gold for the g beta. I also brought rise tr and nfs on xbone and I feel both games are better rise for its longer sp and nfs just cause its awesome and yeah qb on both xbone and PC give nfs on xbone a run for its money in the blurry upscale smudged screen department. The most damning thing I can say abt qb is it makes halo odst  pricetag not look like highway robbery for the folks who already paid for all h map packshell heroic mp was made free..still waiting for store credit cough..in sgt Johnson voiceme! Just found out legendary mp was advertise in crackdown billboards..i find it super funny since h beta was put behind the crackdown paywall,quantumbreak,d1y8u8j,0,t5_2xbd5

7374916,0,t1_d2e2l7h,A fair point although I wonder how much more is going on besides playback during an episode. You think this is more likely than a streaming issue? Are you experiencing it too?It is a lot of data but the point stands that something should be done. Im still willing to bet a fair amount of people would download  GB if necessary but if its a bug fix great.,quantumbreak,d2gh61o,1,t5_2xbd5
