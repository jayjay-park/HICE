This sub seems afraid to criticize basically anything though.Well saying something is derivative isnt really constructive criticism. It is itself a truism. With enough exposureknowledge all art is derivative so originality is subjective. Calling attention to it excessively is really just a form of selfsatisfied crowing. Observe ufirespitters name dropping. Apparently he knows things.Interestingly striking originality often comes from taking a standard method and turning it on its head which is just another type of derivation.

1824863,0,t3_2fggmi,I would like to start off by saying that your music is grounded and true to you as an artist and an individual. Secondly thank you for favoriting my tweet! It made my day! I guess my question is a two fold question  hopefully it makes sense. My question has to do with the production aspect of your work as well as how you feel about the level of saturation occurring within the underground andor EMD industry. In regards to the production aspect of your work I guess I was wondering how you as an artist express your thoughts and visions through your videos and how you work with production companys in making these visions come true. Do you find that bridging the gap between your music and capturing its essence through videovisual avenues difficult? My second question has to do with the industry moreso. How do you feel about the industry you are working in? Compared to other industries there does not seem to be gatekeeping within the field. Social media networks seem to be providing a relatively easily platform to share their music to the masses. Do you find that in recent years there has become more saturation of artists emerging within the EDM field? If so how do you feel about this?. Thank you  ,listentothis,ck9341g,1,t5_2qxzy

2066459,0,t1_cl0xbdh,Id call myself a feminist by definition. A feminist is supposed to be someone who wants equality for both men and women and that also means that inequalities against men are minimized and solved for as well. However I feel many people dont seem to recognize that. I think thats why the title feminist sort of throws people off. People believe that feminists want to move women forward and push men back when its the opposite. Honestly I think perceptions of gender can harm both men and women. Just as women can be forced into certain roles men can be too. I have problems with dress codes that prohibit men from having long hair or ear piercings or anything else considered feminine. I think by differentiating between the two so heavily people are stigmatized into conforming to ideas like men have to be strong cold aggressive etc or women have to be meek graceful conservative etc. Societal perceptions force men and women into harmful characters and perpetuate sexism. Feminism by definition is egalitarian though a lot of people misrepresent it. Thats why I feel it is sometimes more effective to call myself egalitarian. ,listentothis,cl2hqy2,1,t5_2qxzy

Certain beliefs dictate that simply imbibing spirits booze is doing that very thing not to mention the myriad of other substances that can and will take your mind farther from your body and closer to the edge of it.I see great benefit and wonder come from peering directly into the unknown but much like staring into the sun there are favorable and often necessary conditions and preparations.I wear the theosophical seal due to many reasons one of which being the slogan there is no religion higher than the truth which sings to my soul.  I also have experienced a lot of unexplainables and have had direct contact with grand mystery.  Much like broken hearts and wanderlust mysticism and spiritual quest oozes into my songwriting whether I like it or not and sometimes I feel like I am writing the story of a man or woman long since dead.  Maybe its one maybe it is shakey graves maybe I can only talk to it while im in an altered state maybe Im always talking to it.  Those unanswerable questions and more are the reasons I love dangling between the faith that I have the capacity to experience and wield something unearthly and the knowledge that I could easily just be on the fast track to a padded room.

2771303,0,t1_cnj26pu,Oh there was quite a consensus... vote tally was something like  for leaving  for staying. Mods are still talking about it but it keeps seeming less and less of an issue as we continue to improve the bots. Most of the quality problems that had people ticked off have been solved. We still have an issue with diversification though... itd be nice to shake up the monopoly that pop folk and electronic have on our content.The real question I keep asking is what can we do around here to make an impact on the front page from time to time. Music is too slow on the upvotes without big artist name recognition. I think the answer is better music charts for the month. The trick is figuring out what kind of a music chart reddit would like to have.I want to start by turning our top each month into a top where  are tracks from the current year and the next  are tracks from all prior years. Itll help unearth more up and coming artists that way.,listentothis,cnj357p,8,t5_2qxzy

3041074,0,t1_cocypvq,Well it all depends on what you like. If you like Spacemen  which I do then who cares if another band sounds like them. That means you should like them right? Spacemen  didnt make that many albums and they didnt venture too far from where they started. They have a specific tone that doesnt really change. Ive heard Methodrone a million times and it doesnt remind me of Spacemen . But anyway BJM have other albums that are even more shoegazey and amazing by my measure although I really dont like the term shoegaze. Its so stupid. Spacegirl and Other Favorites is a great example of this as well as PolPots Pleasure Penthouse is a really cool album if you like Spacemen . But again BJM does not sound like them to me. Similar genre sure but totally different. BJM dont copy anyone. And its actually my mistake even bringing them up because BJM really isnt even shoegaze whatever the hell that is.,listentothis,cod7ftx,1,t5_2qxzy

3223596,0,t1_cotuhsk,The excellent Numero Group label put out a couple of compilations on vinyl called Good God! A Gospel Funk Hymnal and Good God! Born Again Funk which lean more heavily toward danceable funk than churchsoul but are fantastic.The Light In The Attic label which reissued Like A Ship... also have a less varied but great compilation Gospel Funk which is made up of previously lost tapes from a church record label. They also put out other two wonderfully varied compilations Overcome Vol.  Preaching In Rhythm And Funk and Overcome Vol.  Sanctified Soul and Holy House that also include some more modern stuff.For an overview of how gospel music adopted the styles of more mainstream soul and funk you could also check out the Stax Records gospel subprint called The Gospel Truth. A good place to start is an excellent  track compilation imaginatively called The Gospel Truth The Gospel Soul amp Funk Of Stax Records.Ive got dozens of others in storage somewhere I should really dig out when I get a chance so if I find anything top notch Ill try to remember to comment it here in the future.,listentothis,cow4npy,1,t5_2qxzy

3866625,0,t3_34otri,Eyedea the philosopher. Im glad I listened to First Born when I was around  the same age Mikey started writing this. I was going through some shit when I was  years old trying to figure stuff out in life what made sense and what didnt etc etc. First Born was that album that scared me to the core when I first heard it and I am a metalhead that listens to death and black metal mostly. He had a strange but brutal way of exposing reality and to do it at such a young age just blows my mind. He also is pretty damn humble for example in big shots   He talks shit about big shot rappers and eventually says he is one of them. He disses himself in his first album!

I lived in the house behind the legion at that point so it was right out my door. I feel like Ive seen him play since but all of my Sackville memories from the last two years there are a jumble. I feel like the last time I saw him was at Struts though.Or no it was at the chapel for Sappy in  wasnt it. He played with Kate Maki. They had their kid there just a little baby then. Beautiful show. Thats probably the last time I saw him play. He was in really good spirits.I did a couple of years at MTA then dropped out and stuck around and got into booking concerts and running sound and putting on house shows. Lived there five years from  went up a few times to visit friends in the years prior. Never did see Shotgun amp Jaybird but I remember a Shotgun Jimmie show where Fred amp Julie joined him onstage at Georges. And there was one in my living room where Paul was drumming for him. So bits and pieces.Tidbit Ill share because I never have opportunity to Jim is the one who started people calling me Weaves so hes responsible in a roundabout way for my reddit name.,listentothis,csvlzri,1,t5_2qxzy

Speaking of The Failure do you ever perform anything from it live anymore?  Any KnowMore.orgrelated news?  How did you end up touring with Circle Takes the Square? I absolutely love them and couldnt believe it when they made a collaboration with daysofstatic a few years ago. And now theyre on your album as well... How cool are they? I saw you have a few shows booked in Eastern Europe this autumn. Are you heading straight back to the US after Greece or do you have some free dates left?

On the th of November  they subsequently go to a studio in order to transform the mixtape into a promotional Single that will already contain the essence of the group. This first release notably includes the overt Stupeflip and comme les zot seven titles in all where King Ju pens texts and music with the help of Cadillac.gt The funny and effective title Je fume pu dshit starts to air on Parisian radios. Eventually they sign on Vorston Limanteli an independent label bought some months later by BMG and at the end of  they release their first album Stupeflip.gt The album very much like the first EP contains an uncategorizable sound a mixture of angry guitar riffs akin to Brurier noir Stupeflip also emulates their masks samples of Hip Hop Californian punk pop jingles inspired by French s pop and strange noises Stupeflip was often compared to The Residents an ambient experimental band.gt Through their songs they present the mythical history of the C.R.O.U. a mysterious organization founded in  made up of  members and here to terrorize the population and thereby create a new era the era of Stup.

The band chainplays chaotic concerts during which they used to insult the public this approach which was employed to stand out from the rest of the French music scene is not meant to continue according to King Ju although this statement varies depending on the source. This habit started at a concert where the public did not know the band and is nowadays a kind of trademark with no obvious foundation.gt In  they released Stup Religion repeating the formula of the first album by extending their winning universe as much as consistency furious scratches traumatized children tasteless humor schizophrenic flow punk riffs syrupy amp cynical pop and absurd lyrics. The LP will go quite unnoticed in both the general public and the specialized circles all of which thanks to a shy promotion from their label some fans of the first album were not even aware of the nd albums existence. Follows a series of fantastic concerts throughout France where the universe created on the LPs was transposed on stage with lighting costumes and quite impressive ghostly moods revolving around the theme of the religion of Stup.gt In  despite the LP making it to nd in the charts within a week of its release BMG decided to break the contract following the relatively weak sales of Stup Religion. Follow a lengthy trial from Stupeflip for noncompliance of contract eventually won by the record company which led to the withdrawal of albums still in stores shelves and their return to King Ju. Meanwhile King Ju associated with Simone elle est bonne hyped muse from MySpace to create the duo Simone and Pop Hip a musical electropunk crossover.Julien also works under the identity of his King Ju character with Ed Wood Is Dead for a concept album in which the rapper kidnaps King Ju. The project eventually dies but the title The Party Starts from Ed Wood and King Ju is published on MySpace.gt For his part Cadillac embodies Bruno Candida and twists politicians speeches in satire videos.gt In  an association started from fashion stylistcreator JeanCharles de Castelbajac for the Gallierock exhibition King Ju creating the whole sound and musical look as well as the main musical theme.gt Beyond all these collaborations purely innocuous with Sono Loco and Lofofora King Ju also made the artwork of mmoires de singes Stupeflip remains silent for  years.gt In  new songs start to appear on MySpace which suggests the return of Stupeflip to the stage.gt A DVD comes out in May   containing a  minutes film and  minutes of a live performance.gt Their third album The Hypnoflip Invasion was released on February  .

5271182,0,t3_3n78e7,Tom Lark   artist pic  gt While most bands just worry about noise control getting called to their practice space spare a thought for Tom Lark whose routine practice space and studio was demolished in the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquake. gt Suddenly with nowhere to practice and record with his usual band Lark found himself retreating to his bedroom. Rather than be discouraged by the setback he instead discovered inspiration in the newfound restrictions and was soon penning new songs in a fresh voice and style. Armed with only this new set of songs a defective laptop and whatever instruments he could lay his hands on the Tom Lark EP was born. The resulting work marries ricocheting samples with folk guitar work a plaintive voice and a deft sense of storytelling. gt First single All Night Long combines the woozy lilt of a sparklehorse record with a sprinkle of The Shins and some Britpop melodicism.  Later in the EP track  She Gone starts with a folky  stomp that builds to a crescendo of interlocking electronic beats and ghostly countermelodies while the reverb soaked ballad Tea Sets comes across like Beck with a killer hangover. gt What began as a bedroom project is now reaching a wide and appreciative audience.Initially released online through BandCamp.com Tom Lark EP quickly picked up airplay on Christchurchs RDU radio station placed in the top  songs for  on Radio Active Wellington peaking at  in the top songs in December  and  track on BFM in Auckland. The band was featured on the Australian website Frankie. Whats more international webzine Dingus had this to say on the Tom Lark EP gt What seems to start like a punch from a younger brother taunting overjoyous and bold ends up taking a turn for the more serious by the latter half of the album. With good feelings and momentary satire Tom Lark has crafted in one light a pure and honest record. In another light hes made an near absurd gesture at the entirety of our pitiful existence.

5361134,0,t3_3oggco,Reboot The Robot   artist pic  gt Reboot The Robot started in the summer of  as an acoustic side project.  Needing an outlet for the rough times he was going through Jon Ware the man behind Reboot The Robot started writing song after song  perfecting lyrics and chord progressions.  The first RTR demos were recorded on a  hand recorder and out of curiousity to see how well the songs would do were posted on a small unknown MySpace music profile.  Slowly people began to take notice and soon the profile began to fill with plays and friend requests. Inspired Jon began to write even more songs and soon enough found himself in the recording studio laying down tracks for what would soon become Reboot The Robots debut EP Nothing Something Everything. Many studio hours and a few hundred bucks later Nothing Something Everything  was released to online retailers on July th  to overwhelmingly positive reviews and praise. Fans reacted well to the album and soon there was demand for another EP release. Digging through older unfinished songs as well as new ones the framework was laid for what would become Reboot The Robots sophomore effort When All We Have.Recorded at Blind Dog Audio in Longmont CO and produced by Kevin King When All We Have has become a hit among fans since its release on December st .  The EP spawned many new fanfavorite tracks including Deception Is What The World Calls Romance and Not Giving In.  As an added bonus fans that purchase When All We Have on RTRmusic.com will also receive  free Reboot The Robot Buttons as well a free signing of the EP.Currently Reboot The Robot is taking off time from writing new music to focus on an untitled covers album. This new covers album has a tenative release for summer . A full band debut is targeted for a late fallwinter  release.

Weekly I check their whats new listing of music and make a note of newly released CDs.  Every couple of months or so Ill borrow a dozen or more and spend a Saturday evening with candles lit a glass of wine or two or three and CDs stacked on my player.  Doin it old style!    I listen to any genre as long as it pleases my ear and connects to my soul.  My iTunes lists pop jazz RampB rock as my most populated genres... but I also have acoustic alternative blues classical country dance easy listening electronic folk fusion hip hoprap indie latin new age punk smooth jazz traditional and world.  Often a movie soundtrack will have a few real gems of little known artists who I really like.Once I put a Kanye CD on while I drove down to visit my son and I found once I got to his place I was effing this and effing that... and realized I needed some soothing classical for my drive home.

As far as bands go its a rare occurrence that a magical combination of people capable of pushing each other to the limit find themselves together but after little time playing together it was evident that the members of Woo Park had found what theyd been looking for.gt One half of Woo consists of a fiery rhythm section with a near clairvoyant rhythmic flexibility featuring Luke Sangerman polyrhythmic champion Steve The Bongo Kid Rutledge on percussion and Parker Grogan selfproclaimed bass god. The undeniable groove exists in tandem with an atmosphere of ethereal soundscapes fit for even the most heady of new age souls to bask in Christian Zwit aural chemist and knob tinkerer wields keyboard and synth alike while Brian Sanborn transcends guitar with his singing melodies and cloudlike chords. Emily Nicholss alluring voice floats effortlessly atop of the controlled chaos forming a cohesive narrative.gt Initially taking cues from bands such as Hiatus Kaiyote Robert Glasper Experiment and Little Dragon Woo Park has since crafted a unique sonic niche for themselves and are dedicated to one day hitting the world stage. A continuously forwardlooking outfit unsatisfied with the status quo Woo Park has attained a hard foughtover new approach to a standard instrumentation and continues to push further into their own uncategorized sound a kind of Generation Y Jazz with a medley of influences from rock to electronica.gt The live show is where the spirit of Woo comes alive mind and body performer and audience become one fueled by the music which provokes physical and mental reactions in equal parts.

5533695,0,t3_3qwqgt,GWAR   artist pic  gt GWAR is a satirical thrash metalpunk band formed in  by a group of artists and musicians at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond Virginia. The band is perhaps best known for their elaborate scifihorror film inspired costumes raunchy lyrics and graphic stage performances which can consist of scatology sadomasochism necrophilia paedonecrophilia beastionecrophilia fire dancing fake pagan rituals mock executionsmutilations and other controversial violent and political themes. GWAR was for a long time on the leading edge of shock rock going as far as appearing on Jerry Springer in character and in full costume during the mids.gt The band was the result of the collaboration between Hunter Jackson and Dave Brockie then the singer for a punk band called Death Piggy. Jackson was working on a movie at the time the two met. The movie entitled Scumdogs of the Universe featured a plot involving terrifying intergalactic barbarians. Jackson and Brockie combined their ideas renamed the band Gwar and have been performing as ghoulish intergalactic warriors ever since. Their costumes are generally made of foam latex styrofoam and hardened rubber. It should be noted that the costumes they are wearing actually cover very little with the rest of their bodies being accentuated with makeup. They further their production in concert by dousing spraying and at times nearly drowning their audiences with imitation blood semen gore and other bodily fluids. All the fluids are made of water and dye that washes out easily. It is rumored that corn syrup or a similar product has been used as a thickener.gt Another trademark of GWARs live show is their mutilations of celebrities and figures in current events. Victims of GWARs antics have included O.J. Simpson George W. Bush Paris Hilton and many others. The band also makes frequent references to political and historical figures fantasy literature and mythology. For instance the song Whargoul makes reference to Minas Morgul a setting in J.R.R. Tolkiens Lord of the Rings books and the title of their sixth album Ragnarok comes from Norse mythology.gt GWAR though by no means a smalltime band have not enjoyed as much mainstream recognition as many other bands. Around the time of their second album Scumdogs of the Universe they enjoyed a fair deal of success due in part to Beavis and Butthead. After that however GWARs popularity waned and they were even featured on the VH program Where Are They Now. Though not at the peak of their popularity GWAR was recently invited to play on the Sounds of the Underground tour which was very well received. gt Gwar were at one time banned from performing in their home city of Richmond Virginia due to their raucous stage performances. During that time they would appear in their home town under the pseudonym Rawg and play sans costumes. The ban was later lifted and the band can now play in Richmond again in full gory attire. GWAR was banned earlier in North Carolina for obscenity reasons Brockie was arrested for wearing his Cuttlefish of Cthulu prosthetic penis this incident was the inspiration for GWARs America Must Be Destroyed album. Band members and associates often have cookouts at their house dubbed GwarBQs. The video for Saddam a GoGo from This Toilet Earth appeared in the hit movie Empire Records. Gwar wasis primarily a band of former art students and this is reflected in the obscure references made in some of their songs. Gwar fans are known as Bohabs or Scumdogs.gt The origin and meaning of the bands name has been left intentionally vague by its members although the most widely accepted explanation though false and denied by the band members is that GWAR is an acronym for God What an Awful Racket! One rumor states that the name may have come from Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons graphic novel Watchmen in which a poster reads Pink Triangle LIVE at the Gay Women Against Rape Benefit Concert. Other unsubstantiated rumors state that GWAR! is the sound monsters make in old horror movies or that a fan at a club yelled You should call your band... and vomited before he could finish making a sound close to the word GWAR. A final possibility and the most viable as of yet coming from sources close to the band suggests strongly that the name comes from the answer David Brockie gave to Hunter Jackson when asked what the band should be called. David Brockie simply responded with a mostly unintelligble word and isolated a single sound out of the rubble therefore creating GWAR.gt On Sunday March   Brockie was found dead in his apartment by a band member. According to police Brockie was found deceased and sitting upright in a chair. Foul play drugs and suicide have been ruled out as causes of death and they will await word from a medical examiner on the cause. Gwars management confirmed the reports of Brockies death on the official Gwar website at am on March  . In an official statement released later that day Gwars manager Jack Flanagan said It is with a saddened heart that I confirm my dear friend Dave Brockie artist musician and lead singer of GWAR passed away at approximately  PM EST Sunday March  . His body was found Sunday by his band mate at his home in Richmond VA. Richmond authorities have confirmed his death and next of kin has been notified. A full autopsy will be performed. He was  years old born August  . My main focus right now is to look after my band mates and his family. More information regarding his death shall be released as the details are confirmed. News of Brockies death spread quickly with many of his fellow musical peers and bandmates responding through social media. Mike Bishop former member of Gwar was one of the first to confirm Brockies death. Bishop said Dave was one of the funniest smartest most creative and energetic persons Ive known. He was brash sometimes always crass irreverent he was hilarious in every way. But he was also deeply intelligent and interested in life history politics and art. His penchant for scatological humors belied a lucid wit. He was a criminally underrated lyricist and hard rock vocalist one of the best ever! A great front man a great painter writer he was also a hell of a bass guitarist. I loved him. He was capable of great empathy and had a real sense of justice.

5536117,0,t3_3qy05m,Patty Waters   artist pic  gt Patty Waters is a jazz vocalist best known for her free jazz recordings in the s for the ESP Disk label. Although she has rarely recorded since then she is more and more recognized as a vocal innovator whose influence extends beyond jazz. Fellow female vocalist pioneers Yoko Ono and Diamanda Gals as well as rock singersongwriter Patti Smith have all named Patty Waters as an influence while Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth has stated to be an admirer.gt Patty Waters was born March   in Iowa. She started singing semiprofessionally in high school. After school she sang for the Jerry Gray Hotel Jazz Band. Her family moved to Denver Colorado where she started listening to Billie Holiday whose life and singing had a profound influence on her.gt In the early s she followed the recommendation of friends to move to New York. While in New York she was invited to sing as a guest with Bill Evans at the Village Vanguard with Chic Corea at Mintons with Walter Davis Jr. at Slugs with John Hicks at the Five Spot with Jaki Byard Sir Roland Hanna Ben Webster and Charles Mingus at various times at the Five Spot and sang with Herbie Hancock at his home. She worked in an Upper East Side supper club with Richard Wyands and George Joyner and made a Jax beer commercial with Joe Newman and performed with the big band of Warren Smith. Albert Ayler heard her in a dining club and introduced her to Bernard Stollman the owner of the experimental jazz label ESP Disk. Her most influential albums Sings  and College Tour  were both released on ESP Disk. The first side of her  debut Sings was given over entirely to selfcomposed solo piano miniatures leaving listeners somewhat unprepared for the second side which consisted solely of her minute interpretation of Black Is the Color of My True Loves Hair. Building into hairraising screams and vocal improvisations augmented by a small free jazz combo it remains the performance for which she is most notedgt Only a few months after the recording of Sings a recording from Waters college tour was made druing April of . The release was titled College Tour. This recording featured a completely different set of songs all Waters originals with the exception of the Rodgers and Hart standard It Never Entered My Mind. The recording featured dates with backing by pianist Dave Burrell and fellow ESP Disk artists Giuseppi Logan on flute and Ran Blake and Burton Greene on piano.gt In the late s she spent some time in Europe and then left the music world to bring up her son born in  in Mill Valley California. She has since performed only occasionally with musicians such as Art Lande Steve Swallow and Elliott Zigmund at the Berkeley Museum of Modern Art and at the old Keystone Korner in San Francisco.gt Aside from a subsequent appearance as a member of the Marzette Watts Ensemble on a  LP nothing else was heard from Waters on record until  when she released Love Songs on the Jazz Focus label a compilation of standards accompanied by pianist Jessica Williams. Patty has since appeared with Jessica at the Jazz Store in Carmel California she has performed in concert in Palo Alto California in San Francisco California at the Monterey Jazz Festival in  at the Vision Festival in New York City in  at the Le Weekend Jazz Festival in Stirling Scotland with Burton Greene. gt  In  she released a compilation of previously unreleased material titled You Thrill Me A Musical Odyssey  on the Water label and a year later released Happiness Is a Thing Called Joe Live in San Francisco .

5566677,0,t3_3rdoaz,Dead Sara   artist pic  gt Emily Armstrong  SingerGuitaristSiouxsie Medley  GuitaristSean Friday  DrummerChris Null  Bass Playergt Music history is rich with rock bands fronted by dynamic duos. Looking to carry on this vital yin and yang tradition minus the drama such chemistry often fuels are singer Emily Armstrong and guitarist Siouxsie Medley who front Los Angeles Dead Sara  an electrifying rock outfit whose supercharged music is propelled by Medleys monster riffs and Armstrongs wailing passionate vocals.gt The two musicians are a study in contrast onstage Medley remains rooted in place  a solid steady anchor for Armstrongs almost unhinged performances. A skilled vocal stylist who can handle blues soul and folkrock with equal aplomb Armstrong will unleash a guttural howl one minute and trill as pretty as a songbird the next. Dead Sara is exactly what you want from a young hungry rock band unpredictable and enigmatic and looking to make an explosive sonic and emotional impact. gt Dead Sara which also includes bassist Chris Null and drummer Sean Friday funnel the ferocious spectacle of their live show into their selftitled debut album which they are releasing this spring. Produced by Noah Shain the album is a versatile showcase for the bands talent veering effortlessly from melodic soaring tunes We Are What You Say Whispers amp Ashes to bruised power ballads Sorry for it All Dear Love Face to Face to fierce heavy stompers Timed Blues Test My Patience Weatherman. That diversity is whats honest and real to us Medley says. We love classic rock blues folk metal punk gospel all of it so we didnt want to put restrictions on ourselves genrewise. We just knew we wanted the music to sound really raw and primal even a bit unsettling. gt Lyrically many of Dead Saras songs are survival anthems informed by their struggle to stay true to their vision of being a powerful uncompromising femalefronted rock band. Armstrong and Medley met as musicobsessed teenagers growing up in Los Angeles USA and have been playing together in one capacity or another ever since. Along the way they encountered various industry people including interested majorlabel executives who suggested they develop a more popfriendly sound. gt It was difficult to deal with peoples ideas about what we should be doing Armstrong says. I ended up shutting myself off from everyone and feeling really crushed. I didnt really come out of it until some of my close friends and fans of the band expressed concern saying What the hell are you doing? You cant give up. That emotional experience fuels Dead Saras first single We Are What You Say in which Armstrong who writes the bands lyrics sings I lost myself somewhere I never wanted to be. Now its time to start all over. We were held to the light but we never went blind. You cant back down kid. We are what you say. We are not what you think. gt Ironically We Are What You Say is Dead Saras poppiest song though its still kind of gnarly and sleazy Medley notes. Its like Hey you want pop? This is our pop so fuck off. Adds Armstrong That song distills a lot of what were about. Its melodic and accessible but still intense and unruly.

5644257,0,t3_3sfiao,Dave Bixby   artist pic  gt In the early s there was a subgenre  still being excavated and discovered by collectors  of privately pressed or quite limitededition singersongwriter folk albums that sounded like burntout leftovers from the hippie era. A percentage of these in turn were recorded and released by musicians with fervent if rather inarticulate religious beliefs. Dave Bixbys Ode to Quetzalcoatl is one of these and though its purpose seems to have been to celebrate his deliverance from evil after embracing Christianity it nonetheless sounds quite despondent and isolated in its mood. With acoustic guitar usually serving as his only instrumental accompaniment and a bit of flute and harmonica heard at times Bixby sings in a moanlilting slightly echoing voice whose sad and lonesome feel gives the impression that his demons have by no means been wholly exercised by salvation.gt Bixby also released a second album Second Coming under the name Harbinger around the same time as Ode to Quetzalcoatl. This album would remain almost unheard until both albums were reissued in  by Guerssen records of Spain.gt In late  Bixby opened a website in order to get in touch with the fans that he only recently found out he had. He offers his email address on the website and encourages fans to email him to chat. He also created a myspace music page social facebook page and a live messenger msn account.

She has her more recent stuff on Spotify but my two favorites Time Control and Beyond Standard need to be bought elsewhere.Heres some music that I love from Hiromi.  This first set is some of her more normal work.         Deep into the Night  Nice easy nothing too crazy but damn beautiful         Time Difference   Still really consumable but with a little more intensity that shes known for         Claire de Lune  A beautiful beautiful cover of a very popular piece of music but totally reimagined         Softly as in a morning sunshine  Another cover a little more ethereal         SOLO Haze  Theres something unbelievably sad about this piece.  Its just beautiful and melancholic. This stuff is a little more avant garde but a LOT of fun and actually easy to listen to         Return of the Kung Fu World Champion   This is probably the most fun of her songs.  I cant listen to it without smiling! Its a cover of her own song The Kung Fu World Champion         XYG  This is actually also a cover of her own song XYZ.  Its a little harder than her other songs but I enjoy it.         Move   This is the song she opened her concert with two days ago.  Really intense.  Really phenomenal.

5898610,0,t3_3w2wdh,BestViet Cong  st postpunkexperimental One of the best postpunk albums in many years. Where others simply condensed  or  bands or just Joy Division down to their basics Viet Congs stripped back and lofi approach seems more in tuned with the spirit of the era.Girl Band  Holding Hands with Jamie Noise Rock After a series of singles and EPs Girl Band has finally released their debut EP. Less poppy than their previous singles and far more abrasive yet humorous as well.Low  Ones and Sixes SlowcorePostRock A bit of a comeback after the notbad but sort of dull Invisible Way. This album finds them harking back to the experimentation of Drums amp Guns but with a more traditional Low formula. Another great album from a mostly consistent band.Chelsea Wolfe  Abyss DarkwaveGoth Mixes the doom of her Apokalypsis album with the goth of Pain is Beauty for what is her best album so far.Stara Rzeka  Zamkny si oczy ziemi NeoFolkKosmischeBlackgaze A sprawling psychedelic folk album thats a bit lighter than previous works. Epic in scope but never really feels overly long.Kerridge  Always Offended Never Shamed IndustrialNoise If Sunn O became an Industrial act this would be the results. Sounds like a dying machine lashing about.Jefre CantuLedesma  A Year with  Moons Shoegazeambientglitch Sounds like a lost shoegaze tape lost in a fire while the remnants are put back together.Heroin in Tahiti  Sun and Violence TropicaliaPsychedeliaDrone Grailslike psychedelic music heavy on references to tribal sounds.Pharaoh Overlord  Circle Motorik Pharaoh Overlord performing as sidemain project Circle shows a return to Neu!like trance rock and ranks among the best of both projects. Of note is Circle performing as Pharaoh Overlord in a sister releases but to lesser results.Loop  Array  PsychRockSpaceRockAmbient The first of three EPs  and  due next year from reformed Heavy Psychprotoshoegaze band Loop picks up where they left off back in the s while also connecting to the spacedout ambience of the followup project Main.Spectres  Dying Noisy ShoegazePsychedelic One of the best Shoegaze albums in a while takes a noisier and darker turn. Lacks a bit of variety but makes up for it in punch.Yvette  Time Management EP Noise RockIndustrial One of the best noise rock bands of late follows up their album with a more streamlined assault. Proof that an EP can sound just as much a standalone work as an album.Valet  Nature Space RockShoegaze Her earlier stuff was a weird druggy folk stuff thats a personal favorite of mine. On this album Valet becomes a full band that strips out all the darkness. While I miss the early weirdness the quality is enough to make up for it.Helm  Olympic Mess Droneambient Earlier releases found him making some intriguing noise but little really going on. This one is much lighter but also much more interesting and textured.Flying Saucer Attack  Instrumentals  Psychedelic folkshoegaze One of the best shoegaze acts makes a very unexpected return. While much folkier than early releases the album still retains the outthere weirdness that made FSA so engaging the first time around.Pyramids  A Northern Meadow Blackgaze Most blackgaze heavily skew towards basically being Black Metal with a chorus pedal but this one is an odd duck where it seems like an almost complete  split between the genres. Guitars are heavy blast beats are present but with both more textural along with cooing vocals.Cloakroom  Further Out PostHardcoreShoegazeEmo Where Turning and Title Fight put out albums that are essentially the Basic Bitch versions of Shoegaze Chorus  Reverb! Cloakroom melds elements of shoegaze into their own sound which comes off as much more confident and far less like the aural equivalent of namedropping.Failure  The Heart is a Monster Alt. RockSpace Rock Picking up where they left off in the s Failure continues the Alt. RockSpace Rock opera. A little over long but still puts most other mining the era to shame.Sonic Jesus  Neither Virtue nor Anger Dark PsychedeliaGoth Rock While not too different from Black Angels et al. the band shifts the focus to the postpunk s and makes for a much darker listen. A bit too long at  minutes but otherwise very good.Ringo Deathstarr  Pure Mood Shoegaze You pretty much know what youre in for with Ringo Deathstarr MBV and JAMC shoegaze maybe with some Slowdive for variety yet they do the genre better than most of their peers. Previous albums ran out of steam pretty quickly but the more even pacing and alt. rock tracks make for a more consistent listen.Runner UpsAl Lover  Zodiak Versions Electronic PsychedelicDub Some great electronic psychedelia. A little too long in spots but the best tracks are great.L A N D  Anoxia Dark JazzDark AmbientIndustrial Becoming bit less darkjazz than their previous album but more like the most ambient moments of The Necks. Like a detour through an Industrial area at night.Ramleh  Circular Time Noise RockPsychedelicDrone Power Electronics gone noise rock gone back to power electronics is now at psychrockdrone metal. Sounding less like a slight version of Skullflower who guitarist Gary Mundy would sometimes play with and more variety this time.Liberez  All Tense Now Lax ExperimentalPostRockIndustrial Where all the noisy bits of GYBE! of olde went. Can be pretty creepy in a Throbbing Gristle kind of way. Would be a bit better if the vocals contributed a bit more.Beach House  Thank Your Lucky Stars Dream PopIndie Pop Depression Cherry leftovers still manages to be of better or at least more consistent quality than its parent album. While still a step down from Bloom its an otherwise enjoyable album. Between the two albums youd probably have one really good album instead of one pretty good and another ok albums.Flavor Crystals  The Shiver Of... Space RockShoegaze A shortened version would make for a great space rock album but stumbles around a bit towards the end.Swervedriver  I Wasnt Born to Lose You ShoegazeAlt. Rock An enjoyable album that fits with the setting sun album artwork though I was hoping a return by the most overtly rock shoegaze bands would bring a bit more energy.Kill West  Smoke Beach PsychGarage Not really that different from a lot of psychrock but theres something very enjoyable about it. Feels a bit less dense and more spacious than most.Black Ryder  The Door Behind the Door PsychedelicSpace Rock An odd one where I like almost every track on its own but doesnt really work as a full album. Every track feels like a penultimate track which is an energy level thats hard time maintain over the course of  minutes. The it ends on a notbad but kind of pointless orchestral track. Was hoping theyd consolidate the Shoegaze and psychRock sides of their last album but they basically created a Spiritualized tribute album. Good otherwise.Destruction Unit  Negative Feedback Resistor Psychedelic Punk Aggressive Psychedelic Punk by onetime band of Jay Reatard. Mixed well as a full album but it can be a bit much for one sitting.,listentothis,cxsuazl,1,t5_2qxzy

6243301,0,t3_412vyx,I can definitely help out!My personal favorite is Mastodon specifically the arc from Leviathan to Crack the Skye. Mastodon arent pure sludge and are actually fairly hard to pin down to one genre but progressive sludge is probably the best descriptor for them.Baroness is also very worth checking out and their latest album Purple is a great starting place. Theyre also very influenced by progressive rock but tend to be less influenced by extreme metal and more by Southern classic and occasionally indie rock all without sacrificing heaviness.Red Fang isnt nearly as heavy as Acid Bath but theyre at least ten times groovier and you can really feel the Southern influences here much more than with Baroness. Theyre a great band to listen to if you want something fun but with a sense of heaviness to it.Kylesa on the other hand is not a fun band. Theyre a very good band but they arent fun. Kylesas backbone is incredibly intricate patterns woven by two drummers with heavy heavy guitar and bass piled on top of that and male and female vocalists to top it off. Theyre a personal favorite of mine and I highly recommend their albums Ultraviolet and Static Tensions.If you want to go even heavier than Acid Bath check out Old Man Gloom. OMG is a semisupergroup of underground metal bands and their latest albumalbums? the Ape of God III is great but not for the faint of heart. Youre either being pummeled into oblivion by the heaviest riffs and vocals this side of Electric Wizard or pulled into some hopeless alternate reality by the dark ambient passages that link the pummeling sections and its dang dang good.If you like post rock check out ISIS who yes came before the terrorist group of the same name. They broke up which is way too bad since they were great and the only reason I didnt mention them higher is because theyre even further away from traditional sludge metal than Mastodon is. Stuckup genre purists call them atmospheric sludge but everybody else calls them post metal since their approach to metal is very much like Mogwai or Godspeed You! Black Emperors is to rock. Theyve got some really really solid albums and its a shame they broke up but at least we got the Ape of God III out of the breakup. Check out the Panopticon and Oceanic albums first.,listentothis,cyzamyr,5,t5_2qxzy

While there he began experimenting with sound as the founder of an experimental theater group called Bastard Theater. He moved to New York in . His first encounter with the NYC music scene was with the N.Dodo Band whom he observed many times at their rehearsal space Phil Demises Gegenschein Vaudeville Placenter. This is where he first met Jeffrey Lohn who was playing electric violin with the N. Dodo Band. He then formed two bands in the late s first Theoretical Girls in  with composerguitarist Jeffrey Lohn and later The Static. He also performed in Rhys Chatham amp His Guitar Trio AllStars in  an experience that was very important in the development of his compositional voice Branca .gt In the early s he composed several mediumlength compositions for electric guitar ensembles including The Ascension  and Indeterminate Activity of Resultant Masses . He soon thereafter began composing symphonies for orchestras of electric guitars and percussion which blended droning industrial cacophony and microtonality with quasimysticism and advanced mathematics. Starting with Symphony No.  Gloria  he began to systematically compose for the harmonic series which he considered to be the structure underlying not only all music but most human endeavors. In this project Branca was initially influenced by the writings of Dane Rudhyar Hermann von Helmholtz and Harry Partch. He also built several electrically amplified instruments of his own invention expanding his ensemble beyond the guitar. Early members of his group included Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth Page Hamilton of Helmet and several members of Swans. Later on on the early nineties David Baratier attempted to document Brancas teaching style in They walked in line.gt Beginning with Symphony No.  Branca began composing for traditional orchestra although he never abandoned the electric guitar. Branca also plays duets for excessively amplified guitars with his wife and conducted his th symphony for  electric guitars at the base of the World Trade Center in New York City in .gt His newest piece The Ascension The Sequel was released on February th  featuring a  guitar bass and drum lineup similar to the original Ascension and conducted by Branca himself.gt Brancas music has finally begun to receive academic attention. Some scholars most prominently Kyle Gann consider him and Chatham to be a member of the totalist school of postminimalism.

Before the murders he was on the distant fringe of the Los Angeles music industry known as an experimental folk singersongwriter. He also had a chance association with Beach Boy Dennis Wilson. After his arrest recordings of songs written and performed by him were released commercially attributed to The Manson Family. The Beach Boys themselves had already recorded one of Mansons songs Cease to Exist as Never Learn Not To Love although without credit to Manson at first later releases have varied. More recently artists including Guns N Roses and Marilyn Manson have covered songs by Manson.gt Manson had met Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson and his associate Terry Melcher the son of actress Doris Day. Gram Parsons manager Phil Kaufman recorded Mansons songs on a reel to reel tape and the Beach Boys somehow ended up rearranging a Manson composition recorded on September   in . The song chosen was Mansons song Cease to Exist which the Beach Boys retitled Never Learn Not to Love. Much to Mansons chagrin his name was left off the credits when it appeared as a bside.gt According to Van Dyke Parks Manson came around and threatened Dennis Wilson and Melcher but Wilson attacked Manson and threatened him back. Legend has it that seeking revenge Manson looked up Melchers address but Melcher had moved and pregnant movie actress Sharon Tate was living at the location by the time Mansons cohorts arrived for mayhem in the summer of . Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi convinced a jury that Manson planned and ordered his family to commit Tates and several other brutal murders in what came to be known as the TateLa Bianca murders named after the victims. gt Manson was convicted for being the mastermind and he was not accused of committing the murders in person although he had devised the ideology of an apocalyptic scenario called helter skelter. He is currently serving a lifetime sentence in Californias Corcoran State Prison. On May   Manson was denied parole for the eleventh time. He will not be eligible again for parole until . Due to his eccentric and arguably dangerous behavior as well as his notoriety it is highly unlikely he will ever be released. Manson has never admitted guilt and maintains his innocencestill keeping up recordings while in prison.gt Since his trial and conviction Mansons name and image have been integrated into American pop culture generally as a popular media symbol of ultimate evil. His public image has inspired artists such as Marylin Manson. His songs have been covered by many artists perhaps most infamously by Guns N Roses.

6839448,0,t3_49g659,Kapena   artist pic  gt When one hears the name KAPENA these days immediately a picture of three young men with musical instruments in arms comes to mind. But it wasnt long ago that Kapena first competed in the Brown Bags To Stardom contest representing Kaimuki High Schoolthe statewide high school amateur talent competition. Since then they have come a long way in the music business.gt While their word of mouth reputation grew they moved on to become the house band at the local watering hole Sparkys Lounge. In  Kapenas first album entitled Satisfaction Guaranteed was recorded live at Sparkys and earned a nomination by the Hawaii Academy of Recording Arts for the  Na Hoku award for Most Promising New Artist.gt Their second recording project simply entitled KAPENA hit the stores. Again the public response was incredible. This album showed a true display of the versatility of this group leaving virtually no musical style unexplored. It held Hawaiian RadioKCCNs  spot as the most requested Hawaiian Album for over  months. In  Kapena took home two Hoku Awards one for The Best Hawaiian Contemporary Album of the Year and Group of the Year!gt Kapena has been busy with live concert work. They give of their time generously to several charitable causes and have helped foster a new pride in the Hawaiian and Tonga communities. For Kapena its not just a matter of winning there is a message here. Music is the global language one that brings us all closer together. It is a vehicle for understanding ourselves and others. Thats what they hope to get across while providing a generation with enjoyable entertainment.gt New Horizons the third album became an instant success on the Hawaiian scene.gt In late  the group released their fourth and finest album Stylin. This project skyrocketed to  on the Hawaiian charts and also  on the Hawaiian Reggae charts. This is the first time in Hawaii that one album has been  on both charts. The hits on this album included Reggae Train Only Jah Knows Masese Listen Dont Say Goodbye  an original song written by Teimoni Tatofi  the guitarist and a classic remake of Blue Darling.gt In  Kapena released their fifth album Pure Energy which was a project that lived up to its name and hit Hawaii by storm. This project consisted of the ultimate blend of Hawaiian Country Jawaiian and Contemporary Island Music at its very best.gt Their sixth album The Kapena Collection Volume One is a mix of their greatest hits from Satisfaction Guaranteed Kapena Stylin and Pure Energy.gt Wild Heart the seventh album has a variety of music for young and old alike. They think it may be the album with the most diversity yet with songs from the Islands of Samoa Tonga Hawaii and Tahiti. This album includes many originals written by Kelly De Lima. He calls it Island Music  an expression that explains itself.gt In addition to their busy schedule in Hawaii they have also toured the South Pacific performing in such countries as Guam Saipan and Palau with sellout crowds at every performance. Kapenas unique blend of South Pacific music is being played in over twenty countries worldwide. They have also toured the mainland U.S.A. in cities like Seattle Portland San Francisco Los Angeles San Diego Las Vegas and Colorado.gt Kapenas eighth album Future Frontiers has a wonderful blend of many different styles of music. One of the songs on the album features the kindergarten and first grade classes of the Windward Nazarene Academy. There are four original songs on the album Say I Love You written by Saki and Hilo Rain written by BB Brown which features two rappers  one is Fiji and the other Davey D the program director of one of Hawaiis Hottest Radio Stations KCCN FM. The other two originals entitled The Hawaiian Way and Kalena Koo was written by Kellyboy De Lima. The latter is a song written for his daughter Kalena  nicknamed Koo.gt Kapenas ninth album All Access invites you to take a special tour with a complimentary backstage pass and experience Kapena live and unplugged.gt In July   released their tenth album entitled Ill Build You A Rainbow. KCCN Program Director Davey D said that this album is The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow! Just as the sight of a rainbow evokes varied feelings this album will bring out an array of emotional colors from the blueness of Ill Build You A Rainbow to the red hot fun of Sea of Heartbreak. Kapena chose the song Ill Build You A Rainbow as the title track because as Kelly Boy said The first time I heard this song I knew it was something special. It touched my heart so deeply that I cried and if youve ever lost a loved one youd know what I mean. This song written in  by S. Strong is built around a belief that the appearance of a rainbow is a sign of a Blessing from a departed loved one. Also in this album is Kelly Boys original song Sons and Daughters which was written for the children of Hawaii and was also released on an album entitled For The Sake Of The Children for a benefit event called No Na Keiki O Kaneohe.gt Appearing on their tenth album for the second time is the award winning Tahitian Group Te Vai Ura Nui who also appeared with Kapena at the Waikiki Shell for KCCNs Sixth Birthday Jam. This show was a sell out and the crowd went wild when Kapena invited the famous Sumo wrestler Konishiki on stage to dance to the Samoan song Talofa Teine from their Wild Heart release.gt To date Kapenas albums include SATISFACTION GUARANTEED KAPENA NEW HORIZONS STYLIN PURE ENERGY KAPENA COLLECTION VOLUME I WILD HEART FUTURE FRONTIERS ALL ACCESS AND ILL BUILD YOU A RAINBOW KAPENA COLLECTION VOLUME II KAPENA IS DA CREW THE SOLID ROCK MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM KAPENA and KAPENA . True to form all their works are still called Island Music because of all their songs from all the Pacific Islands like Samoa Fiji New Zealand Tonga Tahiti and of course Hawaii!gt In addition to playing on all the islands here they also toured the South Pacific this past year and performed on Guam Saipan Palau Truk Pohnpei Majuro and for the first time on Yap. The group really enjoyed their Yap tour and thought the island was beautiful and full of friendly people with lots of ono delicious crabs and lobsters. Kapena will be heading back to the South Pacific for a Christmas and New Years Eve concert tour. They will also be going to the Mainland U.S.A. for a full concert tour in cities like San Francisco Los Angeles and Las Vegas. If you are in Waikiki you can catch them playing at Dukes Restaurant and Canoe Club or at the Hawaiian Regent Hotel.gt Kapena celebrated the start of  with a bang releasing their twelveth album Kapena Is Da Crew. And the crew is definitely in the house with this one! Wayne Haradas review in the Honolulu Advertiser said Kapena delivers the same spirit representing the kind of hot licks the group delivers for its loyalists. Gear up for some serious foot stomping sounds that are a Kapena signature in songs like Listen to the Music and Gin Gan Goolie as well as Kellys emotional vocals in Forgive Me.gt This past year was a busy one with the release of Kellys solo album Jus Kelly Boy which includes the chart topping I Cross My Heart. Golden oldies got a facelift at Kellys skillful touch in Tears of a Clown and Handyman and endless summers waiting for the ultimate wave are recalled in his original compositions Pipeline and King DropIn. For a live taste of Jus Kelly Boy you can often find him with his guitar pleasing audiences at the Kahala Madarin Hotel.gt The months ahead promise to be just as exciting! Hot on the heels of the Da Crew will be the release of Kapenas Christian album The Solid Rock a long awaited collection of spirit filled music. Between projects the band remains a popular Saturday fixture at Dukes on the Beach at Waikiki as well as being in demand for numerous special events throughout the state and on the mainland.gt In addition to touring the islands Kapena will be electrifying crowds across the Pacific this summer in Tahiti and spreading their special brand of musical aloha in Japan. The bright lights of the city beckon as the group looks forward to perform in Las Vegas San Francisco Utah and other west coast cities.gt Merry Christmas from Kapena makes a wonderful Christmas gift during the Holidays. They give a gift of songs wrapped in years of precious memories and laced with sweet harmonies from Kapenas heart to yours.gt Kapena  is an album that celebrates the new millenium. Kapena has captured the hearts of fans both young and old near and far. They have broken all age barriers all language barriers and now all time barriers. They have been described as timeless. With every year that passes like fine wine they cure to sweet perfection. The year  and beyond will surely bring more traveling more music more memories and definitely more Kapena.

Listened again yeah that is a good track.Again not sure on Caskitt but when the drummer is the vocalist they get my respect!Like that intro on this A Wilhelm Scream track!Thank you for these will listen to some albums.EDIT Follow upReally liked Beach Slang and Banner Pilots albums.Jeff Rosenstock wasnt what I was expecting but it was ok.EDIT currently listening to Wilhelm Scream wasnt sure if I was going to like it I seem to be fussy with heavier stuff but this is really good really really good!,listentothis,d1kyfjr,1,t5_2qxzy

I only went with Klezmer because thats what they sometimes describe themselves as but Ive seen them described as gypsy punk and simply as fusion rock. I honestly woudnt know how to exactly classify them.

He was the early creative force behind the band giving them their name before they were even formed. Compared to most Dead Milkmen songs the ones where Joe sings tend to be a little less sarcastic and more silly  with the exception of Methodist Coloring Book. Talcum was born in Wagontown Pennsylvania.gt Talcums vocals are snotty but not in an overly serious way. They are simple stripped down and in a peculiar way very melodic. He is the counterpart to Rodney Anonymous deeper more potent voice.gt Talcums guitar playing often recorded in sloppy and rough takes in earlier work became more polished toward the end of the Milkmens body of work. Still his guitar playing will best be remembered as antiguitar. The solo in Punk Rock Girl for example would be melodic and epicsounding if done by a typical band yet Talcum plays an intentionally anticlimactic lead as funny as the songs lyrics themselves.gt He went on to record one album with Butterfly Joe featuring Dean Clean on drums. He currently performs with the Low Budgets and The Cheesies mostly in the Philadelphia area.

8189204,0,t3_4rhu0p,Rayland Baxter   artist pic  gt Its hard to pinpoint the moment that songs are born the day casual hummers become singers or scribblers become songwriters. Rayland Baxter certainly cant and he wouldnt want to. Though he grew up in Nashville to the sounds of his fathers pedal steel he didnt dream of being a rock star. He loved music of course but he liked other things too being outside playing sports working at the bait shop to make spare change. Hed always just let things settle into place naturally following his gut from Tennessee to Colorado to Israel and back again not knowing that when he returned home hed have a handful of songs and the knowledge that at the end of the day he didnt want to do anything else but make music. He leads a life without reigns his work always echoing the ease in which it came to be.gt All of my music has come in a very natural way by following the organic process of life and letting it just happen he says. I jumped my fair share of ships and the pieces came together slowly not by study or design. The result is a record inspired by a life lived not one struggling to inspire life. Down the mountains and the valleys like the breeze he sings on the mtn song were going where we want to go doing anything we please. Hes done just that writing songs that are reflections of what hes seen felt and lived the metaphors found in the hills the slow strums born at home but blossomed across the sea.gt Growing up Baxters father Bucky a multiinstrumentalist for Bob Dylan Steve Earle and Ryan Adams among others made sure music was just a natural part of life a soundtrack to childhood. I grew up around pedal steel melodies Baxter says not knowing how later in life it would shape me and how I sing or place lyrics in a song. Hed met Dylan and become friends with a young Justin Townes Earleback then they were just two kids who knew their dads were gone frequently. One day while out on a motorcycle trip Bucky bought his son a guitar a used blue electric one. He was in elementary school no older than third grade. I played it Baxter says. But I also played Nintendo.gt Most of the time he just liked being out in the field grass under his feet. While he spent much of his teenage years playing sports by  hed picked up the guitar again. The sound of six strings ringing had always been comforting only now its draw proved stronger it was a surprise perhaps most to Baxter himself how naturally and harmoniously songs came. Instead of finishing college he moved to the small town of Creede CO playing open mics at a taco bar and busking for tips. It was a gig as a guitar tech for the band Moonshine Sessions that led him to Europe. After a relationship in Paris went sour though would later inspire the song oLivia he took his fathers old friend up on an offer to spend some time at his home in Ashkelon Israel.gt I was supposed to be there for two weeks he says. I ended up staying for six months. Life in Ashkelon a coastal town close to Gaza involved a cadre of sounds bombs detonating in the cornfields sirens going off so frequently that few took notice or cover. Baxter drowned the noise with his hosts enormous collection of records and documentaries Townes Van Zandt Dylan Leonard Cohen. I would spend my days and nights just studying all my favorite people and musicians and thats when it clicked. One night he couldnt sleep so he went outside to a barn in the back of the house with his guitar. When I came back in I said to my friend I think I wrote a good one out there. The resulting song was his aching pivotal folk tune the woman for me which later became a road favorite and will appear on his debut feathers amp fishHooks.gt Baxter has a saying he likes to use a lot when you find the right river to float down just keep floating. That he did using his time in Israel to craft the material that would become his Miscalculation of Song EP. He began recording his fulllength in January  produced by Skylar Wilson Justin Townes Earle Caitlin Rose and supported by his friends including Eric Masse producerengineer Jacquire King mix and instrumentals by his father Bucky. The songs range from the solemn steel guitar and harmonica anchored marjoria to the locomotive duwop of driveway meLody to the stark Middle Eastern tinge of wiLLow. Each is thickly emotional raw but supremely balanced pulling reference not only from musical idols but from love had and lost roads traveled and trials awaiting back at home. And when you strip it all away these are songs that could exist with just Baxters voice and guitar alone timeless.gt Hes spent much of his time on tour with The Civil Wars who personally invited him to open as well as Grace Potter amp the Nocturnals. Now Baxter lives in a small crowded house with five people four chickens a dog and a fish named okra near the Nashville fairgrounds an industrial part of town on the west side of the river. He sleeps in a covered porch with no air conditioning or heatlike camping he says enthusiastically at that. His hometown has played a vital role in shaping him musically. There is an incredible group of young artists songwriters painters and filmmakers here just a huge community of really rad people. Its been vital to have a great creative group of people I can feed off of all the time.gt His songs are a calming force for anyone looking for change for love or wanting to walk in a different directionbecause it was his own quest for all those things that motivated the music. I had nothing to write about until I was . I had to live through a lot he says and I when I sing I dont hold back. Ill cry on stage if I came to it. Its an emotional release for me and theres no makeup on it. It puts me at ease and thats what I hope it will do for those who listen. Down the mountains and the valleys like the breeze.

I dont get where you are getting dada art as plagiarizing its components. Its a transformative work the original work doesnt have the same meaning nor is one large piece of the work blatantly stolen in large portions. I have no issue with sampling in HipHop and Electronic music as long the sample is actually just that a sample not entire sections of the song with the same melody and beat. I have no issue with Future Funk as a genre but when a large portion of the genre is stolen beats and songs I have an issue with it. Sampling is fine when used right but not when the base song itself is stolen. If you look at the songs not much has changed aside from some pretty basic beats layed over the top of the song.,listentothis,d5b957c,1,t5_2qxzy

Joey continues While our songs are very personal to our experiences we are very aware to keep it open for interpretation. There is nothing more gratifying when a fan explains how our songs help them in their lives. Its humbling.gt Giving perspective Blake states the process of writing this record is something totally different than what we had done before. The pressure was enormous and we felt that every decision we made needed to be perfect. There was no room for mistakes.

8337083,0,t1_d5jnjlr,gtYes by genre convention alone. Even if the artist does not intend to consider the work Grime their work is inhabiting the space reserved for the genre and thus it will be considered similar if not the same.Then by the same logic if an artist intend to consider the work Grime their work is inhabiting the space preserved by hiphop then that particular work is actually hiphop by nature of the space it is inhabiting regardless how the artist seeks to classify it.But you least concede that the artists intent matter less than the actual space of the genre.gtoftenvague distinctions that define this particular genre.gtJust because you have no exposure to a certain genre does not mean it is less of a valid distinction. You are contradicting yourself here. You agree that it is vague even by your definition which I will concede that you are more knowledgeable in yet somehow it is my lack of knowledge that makes this distinction appear less valid. How can valid and according to you widely acknowledged consensus based distinction still be vague? It is only vague when convenient?So given the vagueness of distinctions of genres and space of the genre define the music more so than artists intention I think I am also correct in saying Grime regardless what you want to call it inhabit the creative space of hiphop with its heavily lyrical focus is a subgenre of hiphop and not a breakout genre of its own. Regardless whatever its name is.gtAt the end of the day if you hold no appreciation or care for this specific element of UK soundsystem culture why did you bother to complain about it? This ignorance only serves to raise the ire of folks like myself and contributes nothing of interest or value.Correct I dont hold any appreciation. All I see is a hiphop influenced form of music with heavy hiphop elements that seeks to cast aside its origins of influence by taking on an identity unearned a distinction created for the sake being different and nothing else.

8551360,0,t3_4wwtqy,Hyro Da Hero   artist pic  gt Hyro da Hero doesnt have to front. The Houstonborn Los Angelesbased rapper has a vision for music. It doesnt include flavoroftheweek ringtones and absurd novelty dances. It has nothing to do with prepackaged Hollywood pretense or fluffed and folded egos. Much to the contrary Hyros vision involves real rhymes about real life music with a message buoyant bombastic beats and daggers shot right between the eyes of every fake MC on the scene. Hyro isnt afraid to tell it like it is. Hell call your favorite rapper out in one track and then hell shine some light on a major social problem in another. However hes also apt to get the club bouncing with a grit and gusto thats classy and chock full of swagger.gt Hyro touched down in Los Angeles in November  and hes been silently plotting his hip hop infiltration. It started when he released his first mixtape on Christmas Eve  entitled Gangsta Rock exclusively as a free download via iLike.com. The album went on to be downloaded in excess of  times by fans worldwide. One cut Noose Around Hip Hop called out the socalled Rap royalty for overlooking social tragedies. The track illustrated a socially conscious side of Hyros that has only become more prominent in his new material. However he can still spit a hilarious and incisive line without breaking a sweat like on B Boy Stance.gt Supporting Gangsta Rock Hyro proceeded to tour the U.S. and Canada with West Coast rap legends Tha Alkaholiks. Hyro was direct support to Ill Nio in Brazil and Argentina.  Hes played shows alongside  Cent Deftones Staind Lo Pro Chevelle Halestorm The Used Hatebreed Suicide Silence Taking Back Sunday Bone Thugs amp Harmony Tha Alkaholiks DJ Quik and many others. The live show is more important than anything Hyro exclaims. For me getting in front of a crowd and communicating with the fans is what I was born to do. If you cant connect with your fans youve got nothing. Theres never a show where I dont give  percent. gt The fans have responded and Hyros become a veritable presence on MySpace.com Orkut.com and Facebook.com. His musics been prominently distributed on mixtape hub Datpiff.com in addition to being traded by fans all over torrent and warez sites. The critics have also spoken.   Alternative Press named Hyro Da Hero One of the  Bands You Need to Know in .   Tastemaker blog My Old Kentucky has lauded him on a few occasions and hes been featured on music destinations ranging from ARTISTdirect.com to Absolutepunk.net and Blabbermouth.net. However the music has only gotten fiercer. In August  Hyro dropped his second album once again exclusively via iLike.com entitled Rock N Roll Gangsta. Downloads have already exceeded  and counting. The album was solemnly dedicated to the memory of Ryan Patrick Halligan a young boy who succumbed to the pressures of online bullying and tragically committed suicide. Hyros poignant and powerful Children serves as a fitting eulogy and its been appropriated by Ryans parents on their web site. In addition Rock N Roll Gangsta brandished the explosive Glimpse Into New America and Get Up Get Down. Rock N Roll Gangsta was just the beginning says Hyro. The shit that Im writing with my band is on another level. Its hip hop like youve never heard. Think of it like Ian MacKaye meeting Tupac at the end of the worldwere on some revolution shit.gt Right now Hyros finishing up his latest CD Belo Horizonte which will be released exclusively via HyroDaHero.com in Autumn .   Hyro introduces us to Dirty South Rock the lead single on Belo Horizonte which was produced by Fred Archambault Avenged Sevenfold.   That song is the perfect blend of rap and rock and what I am trying to do with my music says Hyro.   The hood loves it and rockers love it.gt With a smile he laughs Be ready because its only the beginning. Hyros about to wake the whole fucking game up are you prepared?

The members were credited by their first names only Rick guitar vocals Al bass and Tom drums.gt feedtime made four albums in the s. Initially they recorded only for Aberrant Records in Australia but their second through fourth albums were released internationally by the legendary indie label Rough Trade. The second album Shovel received the greatest critical acclaim. The last of these four albums Suction was produced by Butch Vig.gt feedtimes sound was loud primitive and brutal. The most distinctive musical element is thick roaring electric guitar played with a slide over a thick chugging rhythm section. Their loud but strippeddown minimalist approach led them to be compared to the British postpunk band Wire although feedtime didnt know Wires music but feedtimes sound also heavily referenced rural American country and blues. A large influence from classic rock is most easily heard on their covers LP Cooper S on which they covered the Rolling Stones and the Animals in addition to punk forebears like the Ramones and the Stooges.gt Bruce Griffiths of Aberrant Records describes working with feedtime The bands that have given me the most satisfaction to work with... Possibly the most satisfying was feedtime because they became extremely close friends as a result of working with them and I guess part of the satisfaction with them was the fact that they achieved recognition they were licensed to Rough Trade in America theyre now licensed to Vinyl Solution in England and Europe to Megadisc in the Benelux countries in Europe so I guess that was satisfying in the way things happened and a lot of people as a result of my involvement and us working together came to appreciate this band that I thought was really special.gt feedtime surfaced again in  with a different drummer for a reunion album Billy for Amphetamine Reptile.

8655645,0,t3_4ygja6,We Are The City   artist pic  gt Since forming in  Kelowna BCs We Are The City has become one of the most exciting and unpredictable forces in the Canadian music scene. The band soon began earning accolades for its atmospheric progressivepop sound with the release of their debut LP In a Quiet World in . In January  the band earned a whopping  by winning the PEAK Performance Project a massive battle of the bands contest hosted by Vancouvers . The PEAK.gt Now the trio of Cayne McKenzie vocalskeyboard Andrew Huculiak drums and David Menzel guitar are ready to take their most ambitious step yet. In March  the band will release six songs entitled High School the result of an experiment that began as a side project during some down time in the summer of .gt High School was originally envisioned as a fictional band with the members tying shirts over their faces and adopting aliases in order to disguise their identities. Cayne was Lindsey Jone. Andrew was Matthew Curran. Blake was Bobby Reynolds. The project gave the band a chance to revisit their teenage years laying bare some shameful memories from their past.gt We Are The City found themselves venturing into new musical terrain. On the quirky Happy New Year West Africaninspired licks give way to garagey rock outs and fuzzedout Rhodes piano. DarkWarm Air takes a gentler approach bringing together delicate guitar arpeggios with baroque pop breakdowns and a dash of tropical Mellotron samples.gt High School allowed We Are The City to introduce the use of drum machines and string arrangements into their already very layered sound. They are ecstatic to have worked with Tom Dobrzanski Said the Whale Hey Ocean! who produced the sessions taking place in Vancouver at Vertical and Blue Wave Studios.gt With the completion of High School the band members now have their sights set on a sophomore LP. While it remains to be seen in which direction they will steer their music one thing is certain We Are The City will continue their attempt to push musical boundaries and hopefully stumble across something not yet heard in the process.

8993324,0,t3_53gdfx,Ali Farka Tour   artist pic  gt Ali Farka Tour October    March   was a Malian singer and multiinstrumentalist and one of the African continents most internationally renowned musicians. His music is widely regarded as representing a point of intersection of traditional Malian music and its North American cousin the blues. The belief that the latter is historically derived from the former is reflected in Martin Scorseses often quoted characterization of Tours tradition as constituting the DNA of the blues. gt Ali Ibrahim Farka Tour was born in  in the village of Kanau on the banks of the Niger River in GourmaRharous Cercle in the northwestern Malian region of Tombouctou. His family moved to the nearby village of Niafunk when he was still an infant. He was the tenth son of his mother but the only one to survive past infancy. The name I was given was Ali Ibrahim but its a custom in Africa to give a child a strange nickname if you have had other children who have died Tour was quoted as saying in a biography on his Record Label World Circuit Records. His nickname Farka chosen by his parents means donkey an animal admired for its tenacity and stubbornness Let me make one thing clear. Im the donkey that nobody climbs on! Ethnically he was part Songrai part Fula.gt As the first African bluesman to achieve widespread popularity on his home continent Tour was often known as the African John Lee Hooker. Musically the many superpositions of guitars and rhythms in his music were similar to John Lee Hookers hypnotic blues style. He usually sang in one of several African languages mostly Songhay Fulfulde Tamasheq or Bambara as on his breakthrough album Ali Farka Tour which established his reputation in the world music community.gt His first North American concert was in Harrison Hot Springs British Columbia. s Talking Timbuktu a collaboration with Ry Cooder sold promisingly well in Western markets but was followed by a hiatus from releases in America and Europe. He reappeared in  with the release of Niafunk a more traditional album focusing on African rhythms and beats. Tour was the mentor and uncle of popular Malian musician Afel Bocoum.gt Some of Ali Farka Tours songs and tunes have been used in different programmes films and documentaries. For instance his guitar riff on the song Diaraby from the album Talking Timbuktu was selected for the Geoquiz segment of The World PRIBBC program and was retained by popular demand when put to a vote of the listeners. This song is likewise used in  as a soundtrack for the film LAssedio Besieged by the Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci. His songs Cinquante six Goye Kur and Hawa Dolo from the album The Source are also used as a soundtrack in the French film Fin aot dbut septembre Late August Early September directed in  by Olivier Assayas. The song Lasidan was featured in the award winning documentary Sharkwater by Rob Stewart.gt In  he appeared with Black American blues and reggae performer Corey Harris on an album called Mississippi to Mali Rounder Records. Toure and Harris also appeared together in Martin Scorseses  documentary film Feel Like Going Home which traced the roots of blues back to its genesis in West Africa. The film was narrated by Harris and features Alis performances on guitar and njarka.gt In  Tour became mayor of Niafunk and spent his own money grading the roads putting in sewer canals and fuelling a generator that provided the impoverished town with electricity.gt In September  he released the album In the Heart of the Moon a collaboration with Toumani Diabat for which he received a second Grammy award. His last album Savane was posthumously released in July .

9045379,0,t3_545vh1,Basecamp   artist pic  gt A trio with musical influences that extend far beyond their hometown of Nashville Tennessee BASECAMP came to fruition when the three producers joined forces to write. With a natural affinity for writing and collaborating what resulted was Emmanuel  a track that pulls you in and lingers in your consciousness even moments after its end. Realizing there was a musical void that needed to be filled the idea of BASECAMP immediately took hold. Deconstructing typical genre boundaries by utilizing haunting melodies intensified by thumping bass lines and heavily percussive drums BASECAMP effortlessly layer unpredictable tempo changes with elements of subtle glitch and live strings. Combining seducing vocals with irresistible RampB timbre reminiscent of James Blake or Sampha of SBTRKT the trio meshes seemingly incongruous musical textures and chords to create beautiful tension across all four tracks on their upcoming selftitled debut EP. Universally appealing with burning lyrics and a fully realized musicianship that cant be faltered the EP is only a prelude to the eclectic BASECAMP narrative.

9099525,0,t3_54wzbe,Fantastic Negrito   artist pic  gt Fuck a popstar. Fuck pandering. Fuck fakeness. Fuck fear. Fantastic Negrito is the incarnation of a musician who is reborn after going through a lot of awful shit. In fact the name Fantastic Negrito represents his third rebirth literally coming back from death this time. The narrative on this man is as important as the sound because the narrative is the sound. Songs born from a long hard life channeled through black roots music. Slide guitar drums piano. Urgent desperate edgy. Fantastic Negrito is the story of a man who struggled to make it who got it and who lost it all. For anyone who ever felt like it was over yet hoped it wasnt this is your music blues harnessed forged in realness. For anyone who ever considered getting their old highschool band back together this is your inspiration. These are singular songs by a true musician who writes and produces. They are his fuel as he embarks on the third comeback of his life. gt The first life who am I and where am I going?. Fantastic Negrito was raised in an orthodox Muslim household. His father was a SomaliCaribbean immigrant who mostly played traditional African music. When at the age of  Negritos family moved from Massachusetts to Oakland he was hit with an intense culture shock. Oakland in s was a million miles from Negritos conservative childhood. He went from Arab chants to Funkadelic in one day living in the heart of one of the wildest most infamous most vibrant black communities in the nation. Shit was extra real in Oakland.gt By the time he was  Negrito had taught himself to play every instrument he could get his hands on. He was recording music but he was also caught up in street shit. This went on for several years until a near death encounter with masked gunmen. After that Negrito packed his bags and headed to LA armed with a demo on cassette.gt The second life I want to be a starI think. It didnt take long for Negrito to find himself entrenched in the Hollywood lifestyle clubs and bitches and bullshit politics that have nothing to do with great music. Negrito signed with a big time manager and soon after that a million dollar deal at Interscope and soon after that creative death.gt The record deal was a disaster. Gangsta rap was ruling the airwaves and Negrito was in the wrong place at the wrong era. Negrito came out of the deal with a failed album and his confidence gutted. He was infected by the constant emphasis on what would sell which looks hooks and gimmicks would attract an audience. He lost all sense of himself. The songs stopped coming to him so he quit. He sold all of his shit and he quit. gt In  Negrito was in a near fatal car accident that put him in a coma. For four weeks it was touch and go. Because his muscles atrophied while bedridden he had to go through months of frustrating physical therapy to regain use of his legs. Rods were placed throughout his body. And worst of all his playing hand was mutilated. Though he rehabbed intensely for several years the damage was permanent. In  he returned home to Oakland. gt The third life the birth of Negrito. Back in Oakland Negrito forgot about life as a musician. He got married he planted vegetables raised his own chickens and made money growing weed. He also settled into being a man on his own clear of the distractions of wanting to be a star. This is when his specific POV of the world came into focus. His conservative Muslim values melded with the liberal multicultural world of Oakland. The cynicism that comes from struggle made room for the hope that comes from cheating death. He truly knew who he was. He was confident about his place in the world because he understood it as much as any man can. And then his son Kyu was born. gt With Kyus entrance into the world all the creative energy Negrito bottled for years came rushing. His musical choices were sharp and without doubt. He began recording without the hindrances that come with chasing trends. Fuck whats hot now what moves me? Negrito turned to the original DNA of all American music the Blues. The beating life had given him primed him to channel his literal and musical forefathers the Blues musicians of the Delta. gt For Fantastic Negrito derivative is the devil so to ensure his sound is his own every chord comes from a place of immediacy. Immediacy opens the door for instinct. Instinct is Gods tool that makes an artist into an individual. Negrito leaves the original sounds of Lead Belly and Skip Woods intact and builds bridges to modernity by looping and sampling his own live instruments. gt When you listen to Negrito youre invited to hear the story of life after destruction. Your dream can die. You probably will give up. But from there you can start everything over.

9168355,0,t3_55w2yz,Skinny Lister   artist pic  gt Skinny Lister are not your average modern day gentrified English folk group.  Fronted by Dan Heptinstall and Lorna Thomas a vocalist with a lusty cackle and flirtatious presence the London based fivepiece hail from across England. Borrowing the nickname from the Lister family pioneers in the use of anesthetic the band have grown naturally and organically over the past two years. Yorkshire born songwriter Heptinstall Lornas older brother Max and longtime shanty singer Sam Mule Brace met some time ago at a folk club in Londons Greenwich area. The arrival of Tyneside bassist Dan Gray and the naturally exuberant Lorna lifted them into another realm. Up on their stomping feet and clicking their heels the Skinny Lister sound took hold as Dans perceptive ballads and folkie idylls were boosted by an eruption of a rambunctious free spirited rum fueled party music. Soon the Skinny Lister sound was charging down the nations canals and waterways bursting into spontaneous song in pubs and clubs kicking up a summer frenzy at numerous festivals. Over  festivals in fact a nonstop work rate that saw them acknowledged and awarded by PRS as the Hardest Working Band of summer . We travelled hundreds of miles together in a Land Rover with a double bass strapped to the roof sharing the driving playing gigs every night and going out to party afterwards. We didnt make it easy on ourselves but it does bond you as family. Dan recollects. Their allure is immediate  at a time when modern homegrown folk music often spells designer bearded theme park Americanisation Skinny Lister are a welcome throwback to earthier bands.  Their musical blend has something of The Pogues infectious camaraderie and jovial recklessness combined with the bucolic English landscape of Alfred Wainwrights fell walking guides. Now captured by producer David Wrench Bat for Lashes James Yorkston on debut album Forge amp Flagon the bands distinctive qualities make their mark.  Titled after a homemade pub ran by Lorna and Maxs family friends Forge amp Flagon marks Skinny Lister as an outfit who are decidedly more than the sum of their parts. Galvanised by months of road action they transform traditional and contemporary influence into a singular sound. See them live and the impression is fortified.  Not least as Lornas outgoing crowd connecting personality is replicated by the rum dispensing skirt hiking leg shaking five strong all female party starting troupe the Skinny Sisters. The groups folk roots go back to Leicester where Lorna and melodeon playing Max spent much of their youth at local folk clubs hanging out under the stairs as the traditional sound filled the air. When Lorna reconnected with Max and Dan in London she found their interest in the local Thameside folk scene had blossomed to provide an exciting outlet for her newly finessed singing and ukulele skills.  As soon as they put the diddles polkas and jigs in there there was no holding me back she laughs.We never sat down again explains Dan logically.  The folk fever proved infectious and irresistible For years on the first weekend after Plough Monday every year my dad has gone to sing songs and get legless with the local Molly Dancers.  I disowned him at the time but now of course I join him! notes Lorna.We all do. Chimes Dan.The idea of a whole pub belting out a good tune its what pubs are for sighs Lorna. In an era when singing a song in a pub can get you thrown out for rowdiness Skinny Lister  not to mention the Skinny Sisters  are a joyful reassertion of community principles.If you can capture something like that in a gig people are going to go away feeling part of something bigger rather than just standing around with a beer Lorna reasons.We arent taking the piss its a serious primal thing.  You dont need to have been a sailor to appreciate a sea shanty. insists Dan. The debut album unfurls Skinny Listers charms in detail.  Up tempo carouser John Kanaka a trade sea shanty dating from Mules early Greenwich days and stomping celebrations Trawler Man andForty Pound Wedding a song written by Party George  Lorna and Maxs father  which they reinvent with characteristic verve are winningly contrasted with the reflective coming of age waltz Seventeen Summers the lovely nature appreciating Peregrine Fly and the skinnydipping frolics of Colours. Skinny Lister the standapart folk band  not afraid to match sensitivity with a high kicking free for all. Time to open the floodgates and get the deck party started. But beware the Skinny Sisters folks  those ladies take no prisoners! Read more on Last.fm. last.fm  listeners  plays   tags seen live folk british indie alternative  Please downvote if incorrect!

9268162,0,t1_d8qrysg,I like OME Im not too familiar with him so I wouldnt be able to wade these waters as deep as you however I dont think this needs to be an either or thing. In fact I think maybe were looking at this too closely trying to compartmentalize these things into neat little boxes. Its like the literary version of Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle the closer you try to measure an objects location the less youre able to measure its speed or trajectory. I think the edges are a lot fuzzier than that similar to the probability cloud that electrons blink in and out of existence from and considering that OME and Milo are good friends it makes sense that they would bleed into each other as artists. If theres any takeaway here for me its that I need to listen to more Open Eagle Mike so I can get my art rap sea legs. However to be fair and honest I might still call it loser rap because I hate the term art rap. Similarly I also hate the term art rock which has been used to describe St Vincent for what I presume comes from the fact that she dresses funny. It just seems very superficial to me. gtI would argue that Milo dresses up his emotional admissions and disguises them behind literary references and super clever wordplay.Ive personally never felt that and even if he did that kind of plays along with being vulnerable which is a reluctance to be vulnerable. That hesitance might be perfectly reasonable however I do concede how much of a cop out that might seem like Oh hes being vulnerable even when he isnt? I fully concede that as a possible weakness but as I said before hes never really struck me that way.,listentothis,d8qt0bf,1,t5_2qxzy

9426265,0,t3_59ruzo,Qntal   artist pic  gt When they brought out their debut album in  their first recording left no doubt that QNTAL were an act who would leave their mark on the music landscape. Their double bestof release Purpurea sees the trio present a wonderful retrospective in premium packaging and full to the brim with all the highlights and remixes of their career to date. Combatants of the scene journalists and fans bow to a band who have changed a lot and have become the spearheads of a musical movement. Its almost touching to read the comments that renowned musicians have made on the subject of QNTALgt Qntal invite you to dream dance and party. May Dame Fortune always be with them. Castus amp Jordan Corvus Coraxgt Their demanding compositional standards use of ancient languages and not least their brilliant female vocalist always make listening to their music an experience. Asis Nasseri Haggardgt To me one of the most convincing approaches of combining old and new music. Its a shame that our predecessors from the Middle Ages cant hear this music they would have loved it  just like I do. Birgit Muggenthaler Schandmaul  Savagt You can leave everyday life behind follow Syrahs beguiling voice with fascination feeling free and secure able to let go and lose yourself totally in the sound. Musicians who achieve this effect are true magicians  Sonja Krauhofer Lme Immortelle  Persephonegt Transporting modern times to the middle ages and the middle ages to modern times  this approach has marked QNTALs work since Michael Popp and Syrah both alumni of the Mozarteum University of Music and Dramatic Arts in Salzburg Austria founded the band together with Ernst Horn in . Both had delved deeply into old music during their studies. Michael Popp subsequently worked for the Burgtheater in Vienna and the Kammerspiele in Munich as a freelance theatre musician and composer. In both venues and on the independent theatre scene he was involved in a number of productions and  alongside Ernst Horn  played as a live guitarist and medieval instrumentalist with DEINE LAKAIEN. Together with Syrah and ESTAMPIE Popp worked on his own interpretation of medieval music.gt And now there is QNTAL. An arc between history and avantgarde. It did not take long for the bands first success to arrive Ad Mortem Festinamus from their debut album QNTAL I being their first club hit. QNTAL II went one step further with Walter von der Vogelweides Palstinalied. The trio were not satisfied with simply pepping up medieval sounds with contemporary beats. QNTAL transport worlds of emotion and thoughts that apply to the th just as much as to the st century love mourning longing beauty transcendence. Like those glass ornaments in Gothic architecture QNTALs music forms a focus with great suggestive power. In the end stepping out of everyday life is just as easy for the listener as a reflection of their own reality. Together with producer and keyboardist Philipp Groth who has joined the band to replace Ernst Horn QNTAL devoted themselves to the group of sagas surrounding Tristan and Iseult in . An increase in sonic detail and the consolidation of the individual songs in a concept album set new standards  also in terms of commercial success QNTAL III made no.  in the German alternative charts. The magic of QNTALs live shows was captured on their first DVD release featuring footage from the Leipzig Playhouse.gt QNTAL IV  Ozymandias saw the band expand the temporal horizon of their musical universe setting to music a poem by the English romantic poet Percy Shelley including the renaissance with the lute song Flow and the baroque era with Henry Purcells aria Remember Me. The heart of QNTALs style however has remained unaffected. Innovations have been accompanied by a refinement of old strengths with the result that the single Cupido went to no.  in the German alternative charts.gt QNTAL V  Silver Swan finally was an epic journey through another reality. A movie score without a movie unless you count the atmospheric Von den Elben video clip. QNTAL have come very close to their target of newly created old music. But the other the electronic side always remains but a shoulder check away. In terms of graphic design QNTAL also opted for another path and collaborated with the globally renowned fantasy artist Brian Froud.gt QNTAL VI  Translucida by contrast brings past and present together in two respects in terms of the bands history as well as their biography. They have turned their backs on the world of pixies. Clearasbells sounds allow their roots to come to light again on Translucida. Instead of great gestures classy elegance prevails. Translucent arrangements focus the listeners attention on Syrahs multifaceted vocals which are not supported by choral passages this time. gt QNTAL VII  adds the gorgeous Mariko to the mix who adds violin and vocals to the Qntal sound often taking lead vocals to great success. Always staying true to the historical integrity of the writings and figures that are referenced this album features the work of the infamous Lord Byron Meister Eckhart William Blake and more. Noted as romantic works of literature this albums music goes hand in hand with the romantic era an intellectual movement that originated in Europe around the s. Before we get to the music itself it is worth noting that the artwork on the album perfectly embodies the sound within. A painting done by Ricarda Djemili which features four muses with soft features and an earthy palette sets the mood for this album. An almost ethereal scene much like the melodies present within. The opening track Flaming Drake opens with a moody melody and leads directly into beautifully soft vocals. The singing style goes hand in hand with traditional celtic tunes. The lyrics are cited to an anonymous source from the th century and take us back in time with the writing style. Like the opening track Tenacious Love is also sourced to the th century but has an instant hook in the melody drawing you in immediately.Significantly more poplike track three Tyger is an audible interpretation of William Blakes poem of the same name. William Blake was a mystic a poet an artist. A profound staple in history Blake was influenced by the divine and the world around him. As such the melody of the song perfectly encompasses the man himself and brings his character to light. Continuing with the theme of the previous song the following track By The Light of the Moon takes the words right out of Lord Byrons poem So Well Go No More a Roving and makes the poem more tangible so to speak as the words are now accompanied by a melody that completely and utterly provides the atmospheric presence the words neededThe next track takes us further back to the th century and features a more fluid symphonic sound. All of the songs thereafter are no longer sung in English which brings an otherworldly feel to this album. The lyrics find themselves influenced by texts such as the Carmina Burana translated Songs from Benediktbeuern. A variety of new instruments are introduced in the final collection of songs sounds that would make any Renaissance Faire patron shiver with joy as well as the addition of male vocals turning some of the songs into duets. A pop factor was added to tracks such as In Dem Begyn making this cd both noteworthy to listen to AND dance to. Overall this album features a pleasant variety that ties in graciously with the cited influences. Music that travels through time jumping from various centuries and landing into our current period QNTAL is certainly worth a listen even if just to expand your understanding of music or your knowledge of our literary history.gt Qntal is a madeup word that appeared in one of Syrahs dreams.

They have often toured with artists from radically different genres such as Godflesh Isis Prince Paul Melvins De La Soul RJD and Lovage.gt dleks music is dark noisy and atmospheric equally inspired by industrial music like Einstrzende Neubauten the layered noise of My Bloody Valentine and the dense sound collages of Public Enemy. Their sound is often constructed through sampling and a musical base atypical of most hiphop making it difficult for people to classify their sound. They have been described as trip hop glitchhop and metalshoegazehiphop as well as criticized for their broad range of sound.gt MC dlek described the duos music to the Chicago SunTimesIts purely hiphop in the purest sense. If you listen to what hiphop has historically been it was all about digging in different crates and finding different sounds and finding different influences to create. If Afrika Bambaataa wasnt influenced by Kraftwerk we wouldnt have Planet Rock.

9771177,0,t3_5f54jt,Bombino   artist pic  gt Omara Bombino Moctar whose given name is Goumar Almoctar was born on January st  in Tidene Niger an encampment of nomadic Tuaregs located about  kilometers to the northeast of Agadez. He is a member of the Ifoghas tribe which belongs to the Kel Air Tuareg federation. His father is a car mechanic and his mother takes care of the home as is the Tuareg tradition. Bombino was raised as a Muslim and taught to consider honor dignity and generosity as principal tenets of life.gt The Tuareg known amongst themselves as the Kel Tamasheq have long been recognized as warriors traders and travelers of the Sahara Desert  as a people of grace and nobility as well as fighters of fierce reputation. They are a nomadic people descended from the Berbers of North Africa and for centuries have fought against colonialism and the imposition of strict Islamic rule.gt Bombino spent his early childhood between the encampment and the town of Agadez the largest city in northern Niger population about  and long a key part of the ancient Sahara trade routes connecting North Africa and the Mediterranean with West Africa. One of seventeen brothers and sisters including half brothers and half sisters from both his mother and father Bombino was enrolled in school in Agadez but he demonstrated his rebellious spirit early on and refused to go. Bombinos grandmother took him in to keep his father from forcing him to go to school and like most Tuareg children he grew up living with his grandmother.gt Eventually Bombino gave in and began attending a FrenchArabic school that taught both French and classic Arabic. After three years he left the school and at the age of nine he returned to his grandmother to live the life of an independent Tuareg child. The Tuareg culture is matriarchic and the elder women are considered the chiefs of the community the wise sages that represent the power of life generosity and knowledge. Bombinos grandmother instilled in him the Tuareg moral code in order for him to grow up as a respected member of society. Young Tuareg boys are called arawan n tchimgharen or grandmothers children a term that is considered a badge of honor.gt In  a drought hit Niger and Mali killing most of the regions livestock forcing people to leave the countryside and move into the cities or migrate to Algeria and Libya. Eventually Tuareg communities in those countries organized a rebellion to defend their rights as they felt overlooked and underrepresented by local governments. Before the fighting began rebels began teaching the community about the goals of the rebellion through song and the recently adopted guitar. Musicians such as Intayaden Abreyboun of Tinariwen Keddo Abdallah of Niger and others sang popular songs that proclaimed the rights and heritage of the Tuaregs. The style was called ishoumar which derives from the French word chomeurs or unemployed because Tuaregs had lost their herds in the drought and were left with no other means of supporting themselves. Eventually the term ishoumar became synonymous with rebels.gt In  the first Tuareg rebellion began in Mali and Niger when Tuareg commandos launched an attack against local military and government offices. The governments fought back declaring Tuaregs enemies of the state and forcing many Tuaregs into exile. gt Bombino fled with his father and grandmother to stay near relatives in Algeria. One day some relatives arrived from the front lines of the rebellion carrying with them two guitars that they left behind for a few months. Bombino began to teach himself to play the guitars plucking out notes in imitation of the ishoumar songs he had heard.gt In  and  the military regime in Niger was replaced with a democratically elected government and numerous political parties were formed largely along ethnic lines. A Tuareg party was formed and music once again played an important role in educating the community this time about the importance of a democratic system in Niger. While the armed conflict had not formally ended Bombino and his family decided to move back to Agadez.gt During a trip to Niamey Niger for medical treatment Bombino met with his uncle Rissa Ixa a famous Tuareg painter who gave him a guitar. Upon returning to Agadez Bombino joined the Tuareg political party where he met the best guitarist of the party a man named Haja Bebe. He started getting lessons improving to the point where Haja Bebe invited him to join his band. It was during this time that Bombino acquired his nickname. As the youngest and smallest member of the band the other members called him Bombino a variation on the Italian word for little child. gt On April th  the Niger government signed a peace treaty with the rebels and Tuaregs were able to move back to Niger. Around the same time Bombino got a role as an extra in the French film Imuhar A Legend which was filmed in the nearby desert. After finishing his work on the film Bombino settled into life as working musician performing at political rallies weddings and other ceremonies. gt He fought often with his father who did not want his son to become a musician. To escape this problem Bombino decided to travel to Algeria and Libya in . In Libya he made friends with some local musicians and they would spend time watching videos of Jimi Hendrix Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits and others in an effort to master their licks. Bombino was quickly becoming an accomplished guitarist and was in high demand as a backing musician. While working as a herder in the desert near Tripoli Libya Bombino spent many hours alone watching the animals and practicing his guitar. gt Eventually Bombino decided to return to Niger where he continued to play with a number of local bands. As his legend grew a Spanish documentary film crew helped Bombino record his first album which become a local hit on Agadez radio. The success of the album validated Bombinos choice to make a career out of music and he began playing regularly for tourists and locals alike. gt In  Bombino traveled to California with the band Tidawt for a tour organized by a nonprofit organization. During the trip he had the chance to record a desert blues version of the Rolling Stones classic Hey Negrita alongside Stones members Keith Richards and Charlie Watts. The track appears on the  album spearheaded by Rolling Stones saxophonist Tim Riese entitled Stones World The Rolling Stones Project Volume . Later that year Bombino served as Angelina Jolies guide to the Niger desert region during a weeklong visit. During their time together he played her the music of the Tuareg and told her stories of nomadic life in the Sahara.gt In  the second Tuareg rebellion began and the government countermeasures were forceful and indiscriminant. Many civilians were killed and farms and livestock were destroyed in an effort to quash the rebellion. Instead the governments hardhanded tactics only served to galvanize the Tuareg community and Bombino and his friends joined the rebellion. Government forces killed two of Bombinos musicians so he fled in exile to Burkina Faso along with many of his fellow Tuaregs. gt In  he met filmmaker Ron Wyman who had heard a cassette of Bombinos music while traveling near Agadez. Wyman was enchanted by Bombinos music and spent a year seeking him out eventually tracking him down to Ouagadougou Burkina Faso where Bombino was living in exile. While there Wyman decided to feature Bombino in a documentary he was filming about the Tuareg.  Later that year he brought Bombino to Cambridge Massachusetts to begin recording the album Agadez in his home studio. gt Finally the Tuaregs put down their arms and were allowed to return to Niger. In January  Wyman came to Agadez to finish the album and the film. The sultan of Agadez allowed them to organize a concert for peace at the base of the Grand Mosque the first time such a performance had been permitted. Over a thousand people came to celebrate the end of the conflict and danced to the irresistible grooves of Bombino and his band. gt Although just thirty years old Bombinos life and travels have exposed him to the problems facing his people. He has taken on the mission of helping the Tuareg community achieve equal rights peace maintain their rich cultural heritage and promote education. He is an advocate for teaching children the Tuareg language of Tamasheq the local Haoussa language as well as French and Arabic all of which he speaks fluently. We fought for our rights remarks Bombino  But we have seen that guns are not the solution. We need to change our system. Our children must go to school and learn about their Tuareg identity.gt Four thousand years of living in a hostile environment taught the Tuareg that the will to survive with dignity intact is stronger than any external threat. Bombino puts that sentiment to music writes its anthem and gives it a life of its own.  He is known as being emblematic of the next generation of Tuareg a new voice of the Sahara and Sahel fusing traditional Berber rhythms with the energy of rock and roll and songs about peace. After thirty years of drought rebellion and tyranny Bombino extols his audience to remember who they are but also realize who they can be.This biography is based largely on an interview conducted with Bombino in December  and on materials prepared by Ron Wyman of Zero Gravity Films.

The band was founded by Laura Macfarlane who played drums in SleaterKinney in  as a solo project. The first album  was recorded with her playing all the instruments.

Other former members of the band are Iain McIntyre who played with Laura in several earlier bands and Amy Clarke formerly of The Vivian Girls. Meg Butler joined in .gt Ninetynines music has been described as artpop combining elements of indie rock post punk and power pop with strong melodic elements and an often playful approach. Some of their songs incorporate experimental elements such as unusual time signatures or exotic scales. One of the bands trademarks is the use of Casiotone keyboards and chromatic percussion typically a vibraphone in their music and the musicians frequently swapping instruments between songs and sometimes in the middle of songs.gt Ninetynine have played live extensively and played support for bands including The Paradise Motel Stereolab Dirty Three Le Tigre and Preston School of Industry. They have also embarked on many selffunded tours playing in Japan the UK Europe and North America these tours have usually been assisted by contacts in local live music scenes. It is quite possible that Ninetynine have more fans outside of Australia than within.gt The members of Ninetynine have been known to play different music together under different names During their  European tour Iain and Laura played support sets for Ninetynine as  with Iain on vocals performing mostly old Sea Haggs songs.

Her extraordinary talent as a master jazz pianist at such a young age should alone put her in the realm of the stellar.      Available here for the first time Ms. Peises Atlas Eets Christmas is a strange and beautiful experience. Little is known of her musical and recording life. Most of what is known is shrouded in clouds of legend and smoke of myth. But what is clear is her expressive playing and her unique arrangements.     The Atlas Eets Christmas collection is said to be a rehearsal for a doomed or poorly recorded session. But what an inspired doomed session it turned out to be. The forgotten facts of the trio that accompanies her will perhaps be invisible to us forever. But as we hear Imagene is not the only musical star shining through. Ominog Bangh the synthesizer virtuoso playing the outmoted The LaughingCrying Glider Synthesizer and Indian classical musician Shineyu Bhupal are obvious added otherworldly treats.gt    Atlas Eets Christmas stands as a missed opportunity. Its uncanny coincidence of a Middle Eastern talent embracing such American themes jazz piano Silver Bells and Winter Wonderland as we know now are glimpses of a future that was never to be. With her powerful message of kindness and peace we can only imagine if Ms. Peise had become an international star her influence could have in some other space and time prevented the current apocalyptic environment.gt     We can not know if her story is truly triumphant or sad. She is rumored to have committed suicide in . But if she really is gone from this world in the physical sense then she is gloriously hovering above us in the metaphysical dimension as a source of sublime pleasure and reassurance anytime we need her.

10060289,0,t3_5jtqdd,Luko   artist pic  gt When it comes to music Louisiana artist Lucas Owens better known as Luko is trying to redefine the sound of hip hop in his area. In todays fast paced industry Luko attempts to stay in his own lane by refraining from musical trends and fads. When you listen to his music he gives you a vivid portrayal of a child born in the ghetto that longs for something more Inner Peace. Luko an Iraq war veteran and Hurricane Katrina Relief Soldier has seen some bad days and war in his lifetime but through it all he manages to channel his negative energy into a great positive sound that proves he can hold his own to some of hip hops best. Luko began his career freestyling on the streets in his hometown Minden Louisiana Shreveport Bossier Louisiana on the rough and tumble streets of his adjacent Eastside neighborhoods called Warsaw and Shiney. After graduation Luko went on to  join the Army National Guard and go on to college on the G.I. bill.  Lukos dream as a college graduate  were short lived as he was called to serve in Iraq and Kuwait after .  There he learned that the pain and suffering he experienced in his hometown was nothing compared to what others endured in foreign countries. Thats when he learned to appreciate the good things about living in his hometown affectionately known as MTown by its residents.  After Lukos return from Iraq he began to write and record his own songs about what he saw and what others were experiencing in his city. In  he and his cousin C.C. along with his neighbor local rapper Kay Jones recorded songs that began buzzing all over his city. Then with help from manager Miko Duty he assisted in forming the local rap group Foe Headed Monsta along with C.C.  F.B. and Dat Boi Hill. The group had minor success with their underground singles Designated Driver and Self Esteem which both got moderate local radio airplay in . It also got them featured and interviewed on Hot  in New York City in .  Today with two critically acclaimed mixtapes in Luko has honed his talents and stepped up his writing and recording work ethic with one true motto that keeps him going Give the people what they want GOOD Music and he has proven true with each song.

10065107,0,t3_5jwko1,Maggie Rogers   artist pic  gt First known for her  viral hit Alaska singersongwriter Maggie Rogers combines folk dance and RampB into a powerfully emotional yet crowdpleasing sound. Growing up in rural Maryland Rogers began playing harp at age seven and loved the music of Gustav Holst and Vivaldi. Meanwhile her mother played her neosoul divas like Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill by the time she was in middle school shed added piano guitar and songwriting to her repertoire. While studying at St. Andrews School in Delaware she fell in love with the banjo and folk music and attended a Berklee School of Music program during the summer after her junior year. Rogers won the programs songwriting contest which spurred her to focus on writing as high school came to a close. During her senior year she turned a broom closet into a makeshift studio and recorded what became her first album s The Echo Rogers included her demos as part of her application to New York Universitys Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. She released another folky album s Blood Ballet during her sophomore year at the school. However her sound was evolving thanks in part to her discovery of electronic music while studying abroad in France. Rogers united the different strands of her music with huge success in  with Alaska a song she wrote in  minutes about a hiking trip for a masterclass with Pharrell Williams. A video of a visibly moved Williams listening to the song went viral that June resulting in millions of views as well as hundreds of thousands of plays of The Echo and Blood Ballet. Rogers released the finished version of Alaska later that month and planned to release an EP in the near future.

Adriannes voice and guitar playing speak of rich emotional territory with grace and insight. In her words the record tracks the masterpiece of existence which is always folding into itself people attempting to connect to both shake themselves awake and to shake off the numbness of certain points in their life.

10644942,0,t1_dddvx32,You are assuming that I dont create music personally. I do. I could write this retarded ass music on the pot. You say  hey ballzdeep make a shitty gutterpunk whiskey romance song with four chords. And I would say not now bro. Im taking a shit which sounds better than that entire genre of music. And youd be like dude thats not fair. You used to listen to that kind of music. You even wrote a few after that girl you had a drunken romance with broke your heart. To which I would respond  thats fair. It just seems so juvenile and trite to me now. There are a lot more important themes to cover and the genre just didnt allow for subtle ideas or complex melodies. Everything was just so expected. I poured my heart into it and it was therapeutic but I never really expected anyone else to enjoy it. It was surprising when they did but I could never be proud of it because it was one of the lowest most selfish states of mind Ive ever been in and when I grew out of it I started to despise the adoration some people have for self loathing music because it seems like a selfish and unwise point of view. Also Im out of t.p. Could you slide some coffee filters under the door.?  And youd be all like  I guess I understand your point of view but its art man. People like what they like. It worked you through some angst and loneliness didnt it? Grabbing the coffee filters I would respond.  yeah I guess I just dont like seeing people making the same mistakes I made. Its also really hard for me to deal with when I see a guy get a positive reaction for such a simple song because I dont get very positive reactions from my music and I spend so much time pouring over and perfecting my music and it goes over most peoples heads. Sometimes it makes me want to dumb my music down a bit so that I can reach more people. Particularly young listeners but I know if I do that I wouldnt be proud of what I made and it would make music an unbearable chore and completely ruin it. You say something like yeah I guess I could see that. You shouldnt shit on somebody elses music just because you think it beneath you though. A lot of people prefer Picasso to Rembrandt. Its not about the art. Its about how you make people feel. And I would say I guess so.,listentothis,dddxzsi,-8,t5_2qxzy

Inspired by the words All are from the dust and to the dust all return Missio seeks purity in broken things through minimalistic songwriting. gt The art of creating has become something that continues to show him that beauty and purity are found in all aspects of life. In times of emotional distress he write songs. In times of invigorating happiness he write songs. There has become an incredible comfort found in molding a blank canvas into a piece of art that he find to be extraordinarily beautiful. gt Prior to Missio he found himself writing songs in the name of fame lured by the sweet distaste of vanity. He found very little enjoyment in this endeavor. Festivals and showcases were played and he would often dislike singing certain songs....but for the sake of success who cares right? he had lost my desire to create and nothing meant anything to me any longer. He lost purpose and became blinded by the opinions of people he would never meet.gt In August of  he made the conscious decision to move into a  airstream trailer quieting my mind and focusing on my craft. He became inspired to create songs again giving little thought to strangers opinions. Fifty two songs later he is ready to release a few of them. His desire in this endeavor is not an attempt to grow my brand  He simply want to unite his family and friends into a lasting journey of sharing their gifts and love for the arts and its culture. gt May you hear these songs and be inspired to find purity in the things that are broken.

Garland knew that one day Kuja would have to die so he created Zidane to take his place who is supposed to eventually grow more powerful than him. Kuja reacts to this by dumping Zidane on Gaia. He then proceeds to far exceed Garlands expectations when he single handedly wreaks havoc on Gaia. Garland intervenes however when Garland tries to obtain the eidolon Alexander saying that Kuja has lost sight of his mission. Kuja is then determined to obtain an eidolon more powerful than Alexander so that he can compete with Garland. He attempts to obtain such an eidolon at Mt. Gulug but instead decides to extract Eikos eidolons. His plans change again when he witnessed Mog going into a trance. He realizes a trance is set off by a hatred for ones environment. He then absorbs the souls of the Invincible making himself more powerful. He confronts Zidane and his party on Terra after they have already fought Garland. At the end of the battle Kuja goes into a trance and casts Ultima overwhelming the party. He then kicks Garland off a cliff but Garlands voice can still be heard. Kujas ego shatters when Garland tells him that he is not as he had always thought immortal and the resulting panic and rage leads him to insanity and ends up destroy his homeworld of Terra. Garland does not die until after the party is half way through Memoria. Kuja enters Memoria which appears apparently due to the destruction of Terra and attempts to destroy the crystal before which he is confronted by Zidane and his party. Kuja casts Ultima again declaring that it is not fair for everyone else to live if he must die this time killing Zidane and his party. He then destroys the crystal prompting Necrons appearance. The party defeats Necron however saving the world. This also stops Gaias assimilation into Terra. However they are once again alive and Kuja decides to save them by teleporting them out of the Iifa tree. Zidane decides to save Kuja but he is too late. When Zidane reaches Kuja Kuja realizes that his whole life was misguided. He dies shortly afterward but manages to save Zidane by casting a barrier when they are both attacked by the lifa trees roots.

Living and working in New York City the pair began performing regularly as a duo.  All along they were crafting the sound and songs that would form the foundation for a colossal rock band influenced by the strident English three and fourpieces of the s the dark pop and heavy grooves of the s and the transcendental noisy acid sounds of modern rock.gt The bands first fulllength album Soft Targets was recorded in Los Angeles and Brooklyn in . However they were loathe to release the album without a permanent drummertellingly a constant snag since EGs inception. Taking a leap of faith Matt and Kamara vowed to play a gig every week until their dream drummer found them. One fateful evening a gig at Brooklyns Southpaw brought them a friend in guitar player Kirk Douglass of The Roots. Douglass became a fan and brought his friend and Gold Crowns bandmate Ricc Sheridan to gigs for the next few weeks. Ricc says I awoke from a dream one night and knew that this was my band. A rockneckinducing jam confirmed that the band had found its holiest trinity. They hit the ground running with Big Ricc Sheridan on drums and the world has been rocking their faces ever since!gt Released in October  Soft Targets earned loads of fans and critical acclaim from publications including The New Yorker SPIN Rolling Stone Brooklyn Vegan and Pitchfork. Even more so the bands live show quickly drew heaps of attention and gained a steady reputation among critics and fans alike as a veritable rocknroll wrecking ball. Earl Greyhound toured relentlessly for the next two years all over the US Canada and Japan and autumn  was spent playing theatres as openers for the bands good friend Shooter Jennings as well as Soundgarden and Audioslaves Chris Cornell.

11586857,0,t3_65dl5v,The High Llamas   artist pic  gt The High Llamas are a Londonbased musical project created by IrishEnglish guitarist and songwriter Sean OHagan after the demise of his group Microdisney. Although he writes and arranges the music and frequently uses the High Llamas moniker for his own personal musical efforts e.g. remixes the High Llamas are nominally a group which usually includes Microdisney bassist Jon Fell and a rotating cast of others including keyboardist Marcus Holdaway and drummer Rob Allum.gt Although the High Llamas output including the eponymous debut album technically credited to Sean OHagan shows influences including pres American pop and folk Brazilian jazz and bossa nova film composers of the s and s European electronic music criticism of OHagans work most frequently includes references to Brian Wilsons psychedelic period andor kitsch lounge revival. Although OHagan sometimes expresses discomfort at reviewers claims of derivative works he generally wears his influences on his sleeve even naming several more recent songs after the composers and pop musicians who most inspired that particular track. Examples Bach Ze Pat Mingus Shuggie Todd. The Beach Boys influence on OHagan is most obvious on the expansive cinematic  album Hawaii a musical spaghetti western on themes of tourism and colonialism. It blended elements of Pet Sounds Smile and Wild Honey so expertly that OHagan was even recommended by Bruce Johnston to produce an eventually mixed Beach Boys comeback LP.gt The High Llamas own musical arrangements vary according to album but marimbas nylonstring guitars and heavily reverbed pounding tack pianos are often featured. For a period in the late s OHagans work was often marked by distinctive vintage synthesizer gurgling or bouncing effects first explored and developed in Turn On his experimental collaboration record with members of Stereolab. The High Llamas albums are also notable for frequent guest appearances by members of that band with whom OHagan once played guitar and for whom he often contributes string and horn arrangements.gt The High Llamas infrequently tour and only release an album every few years since the group was dropped by V Records they have made it clear that their records are personal projects that do not support them financially. OHagan frequently does arranging and production work for artists like The Boo Radleys Doves and Sondre Lerche and percussionist Allum has worked with Turin Brakes. Their work for V is anthologized on the compilation Retrospective Rarities and Instrumentals and they continue to record for Duophonic Records UK and Drag City US. Their latest album Here Come The Rattling Trees was released in January  after a five year break.
