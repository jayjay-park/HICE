It does work if youre walking along the bottom but then if the topography of the bottom doesnt line up you might have a rough time. Another thought I recall there being some difficulty teleporting entities riding other entities. I dont have my computer in front of me at the moment to test it but you might have to teleport the boat instead of the player or it might not even be possible to teleport a boat rider.,CommandBlocks,d01h7ts,1,t5_2yet0
