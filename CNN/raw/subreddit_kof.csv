I can tell you a but about clark though since I main him. Hes really situational on his HDs and involve a lot of karas.Here is on by BalaI personally do a different one because its easier for me and requires no kara on his turn punch. I can try to upload a video of it if you wantOtherwise with clark I just do his regulad HD combosif I know its going to kill and assuming you have him on point which involve ex grab into his neo max.Im sorry if this doesnt help much.,kof,cfdzknf,1,t5_2r6dh

Maybe there are some advantages to using a keyboard but Im not aware of any. Im willing to bet that there are a few disadvantages as well. For example if you are holding forward and then press back does the back input register if you havent yet let go of forward? That isnt a rhetorical question I honesty dont know and would love to know the answer.  As far as switching to something else how familiar are with pads and sticks? Also have you ever looked into the hitbox sticks? Theyd likely be the easiest transition for you. I believe they are designed to avoid the problem I mentioned above but Ive never used one so Im not sure. ,kof,cs7dy3b,1,t5_2r6dh

KOFXIII is way more about feeding the meter god and not dropping a huge combo than more classical fighter gameplay.This needs to back up more towards KOFUM in behavior. Supercancels are fine doing loops of combos while you burn  stocks of meter and rub your HD gauge all over someones face is not,kof,cvrwe92,1,t5_2r6dh

8807196,0,t1_d76fkuy,Hes a mid range character or at least thats how I play him. His poke normals are slow but one can lead to knockdown combo and the other has guard point and go airborne briefly. Command grab if landed leads to free combo and doesnt go away if you were hit by projectile or whatever after it succeeds. You have more than enough time to recover from hitstun then casually dash in and combo.He has several ways to engagedisengage by utilizing dark quanta which has better recovery than roll and d version of sweep which travels SUPER fast and have very little whiff recovery so you can pressure right after or just slide to escape jump insAt close range he can combo from b to knockdown or do whatever normals then either cancel to star crash which is supposedly even on block or dark quanta side switchescape depending on situation. Depending on the distance star crash can crossup or stay on the same side.Most knockdown can lead to otg meteor which can add on good damage to his combo. Otg meteor requires meter which is why it isnt recommended to put him out first.Verse has no real anti air and possesses mediocre projectiles. Hes no Nakoruru Andy or Robert thats for sure but hes nowhere garbage DONT tier as people seem to label him as. These are just some stuffs on top of my head.,kof,d76i7c5,3,t5_2r6dh
