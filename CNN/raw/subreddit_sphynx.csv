1162503,0,t1_ci092o0,If you arent home very much then you really shouldnt be looking at getting a Sphynx. Theyre extremely social and can get quite lonely. They dont like to be left alone. Add what prauling said about general cleaning and bath rituals and yes theyre quite high maintenance. ,sphynx,ci0efrs,1,t5_2u924
