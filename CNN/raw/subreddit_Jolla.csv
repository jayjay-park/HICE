2033632,0,t1_cky9e9y,Good idea. Ive heard there are ways of getting it on an Android device currently but theyre not easy. The Z Compact is a beautiful device and I was thinking of picking it up anyway. Being able to install Sailfish on it would seal the deal.,Jolla,ckybhud,1,t5_2ugpn

3216566,0,t1_cove9eg,Yer only problem is i didnt have money at the time for the tablet was so gonna get one maybe just nexus  with sailfish if worse comes to worse,Jolla,covedgb,1,t5_2ugpn
3424688,0,t3_2zam1q,Snapchat works very well as does most other Android apps as well. There are however some that wont work because they rely on Google services. In my case I couldnt get Strava to work and had to find an alternative.,Jolla,cpin12p,1,t5_2ugpn
4548837,0,t1_ct3zt7x,According to Intex representative yes. Gizbot is wrong here and the topic is misleading thats not the phone they are about to unveil,Jolla,ct406z1,1,t5_2ugpn

5504821,0,t1_cwef351,gt I dont know ubuntu phone so im not sure about what is open and what is not.Pretty much all of it is open the shell UI toolkit default apps etc. The only things that arent open are some drivers used in the device images.,Jolla,cwfajaz,2,t5_2ugpn
5716212,0,t1_cx5kgqb,I dont think they ever had enough cash to make a second phone. They only managed the tablet because of the huge help from Intel and even then they had to use a kickstarter.All your ideas sound great but you just dont know how feasible they arewere. Everything takes money. These guys came into this with a huge bag of experience from Nokia so they werent amateurs.,Jolla,cx5nhen,8,t5_2ugpn

5788008,0,t3_3ucii4,Jolla is getting out of the hardware business for a reason already before their financial issues became too large to conceal. Both the phone and the tablet are just showcases for the software and applications and meant to attract companies that would license the OS.Making hardware is hard expensive and has a very low profit margin unless you are in a dominant position like Apple. Selling it to consumers is even more problematic as you have to maintain both a retail and care infrastructure. Jolla never came anywhere close to selling sufficient amounts of hardware to finance their whole operation in a sustainable way.,Jolla,cxek210,3,t5_2ugpn
5960961,0,t1_cy0z9ih,Or Jolla ordered more devices built than was preordered and that it is the surplus that is being sold off from the manufacturer now while Jolla are still negotiating to pay for the ones actually sold.,Jolla,cy10gsm,3,t5_2ugpn

8926974,0,t3_52k5a7,Its not I believe theyve discontinued it and are now pushing people to get the Intex Aqua Fish.EDIT I still dont see them putting it back in stock and essentially compete with their licensees. That wont bode well for them if they do.,Jolla,d7kw2xu,4,t5_2ugpn
8963081,0,t1_d7m3odx,Not an issue for you but if you live in Europe customs can confiscate it since the Aqua Fish is not CE certified.,Jolla,d7p874q,2,t5_2ugpn

10943068,0,t1_de8p0h8,Well Quaternion could probably be ported to SailfishOS. Its written in C and uses QML and theyre willing to accept patches which add SailfishOS support. I guess mainly an interface has to be made it should compile fine for ARM already.,Jolla,de8p7va,1,t5_2ugpn
11016230,0,t1_degiws5,It doesnt sound like it IS uncertainty on my part about the direction the OS will be taking in the future. Though the question was posted as an actual attempt to learn something and not to undermine the subject,Jolla,degnq73,1,t5_2ugpn
