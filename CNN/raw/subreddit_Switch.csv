10598217,0,t3_5rlymp,Im curious as well  if it uses standard USB C specs it should work with any USB C charger but then again the early days of the new standard have been a mess. Id really like to know if an Apple USB C charger will work but its W I believe  Id be worried about overcharging the Switch.,Switch,dd94hx6,1,t5_2svh8
10660111,0,t3_5sir27,Id recommend waiting. Unless of course that zelda needs saving asap.,Switch,ddficga,6,t5_2svh8
10710935,0,t1_ddkippx,This is true but that doesnt mean itll be very functional on the road either.  Nintendos willingness to compromise their titles doesnt mean others will be willing to.,Switch,ddkr3mz,1,t5_2svh8

10860230,0,t3_5v85jz,Honestly  we will most likely not get any additional units in for launch. However we are holding a strict  hour pickup window for those who have pre ordered. Unless a guest has made specific arrangements with the store any units that are not picked up by the end of that window will be sold on a first come first serve basis.  That will be your best chance. ,Switch,de05mq4,2,t5_2svh8

11014780,0,t3_5eh9ou,Just ordered mine. The anticipation is killing me already DI want to see the Switch become the allinone home portable AR and VR console that it can be. Its the perfect fit for VR if they can work out the kinks.,Switch,deghszu,1,t5_2svh8

11175121,0,t1_deyfaj9,No region locking means the games will run on any switch. Also make sure that you arent buying a v system and plugging it into a v source. Your adapter will explode. ,Switch,deyorc4,2,t5_2svh8
11215566,0,t3_6034cb,Similar situation no TV although I do have a monitor that would work and I have a switch. I intend to never plug it into a screen. All I can say is Ive put  hours into zelda and its been great. As a handheld I can have next to my sofa etc its famtastic just hoping the software developed for it is more extensive that the wii u. ,Switch,df39reh,5,t5_2svh8

11275524,0,t3_5yayrl,I wasnt worried about the potential of an exploding battery before this call. I have the same issue.  After reading this post I decided to call Nintendo.  When I described the problem to the rep the rep told me this is a very serious issue.  The rep asked me if anyone was hurt or if there was any property damage.  I was a bit taken aback by that inquiry before realizing his point that this potentially could be a battery issue.   He put me on hold then told me he needs to escalate this issue.  They took my info and told me someone will call me back within  business days.  Everyone else in this thread seemed like they got this resolved in one call.  I wonder why I have to wait?,Switch,dfa2bpd,1,t5_2svh8

11794495,0,t3_68a26j,It captions each of those three if you pause during a race. Its a bit counterintuitive to have it described after the match has started but it works I guess.,Switch,dgwy29c,4,t5_2svh8
