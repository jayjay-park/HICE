6961619,0,t1_d14s31s,Thank! Mr Pulse isnt as Aussie so he doesnt know it is in the sidebar of CJA to thank me for flair. I dont even know who put it there but is was kind but unnecessary. Even after I got let back at ROZ I still spend more time at CJA because you folk have a better sense of humour than many of them. I remember a month or two ago someone posted at CJA about a ROZ post that was removed there I think it was you saying to someone that they dont notice the respectful centre or right getting downvotes because they arent on the end of it even with my outlook that does well at ROZ I find it astounding that anyone fails to see the hivemind and circlejerk that it is. Oh no we only downvote trolls? What bullshit I saw it and mentioned it even before I knew CJA was a thing. It has been happening for years and I fail to understand how people are so blind. Those people at ROZ arent mature enough to deal with conflicting view points in the long run that will hurt them a brain that is never challenged will never grow. If you are busy with an echo chamber and patting yourself on the back for doing well in one then you will never be challenged you will never learn or grow as a human this is a sad fact that many at ROZ will never realise. Their desire for a safe place will hurt them in the long run. Sorry for the long rant but I hope you enjoy it. You could do a copypasta of this at CJA for easy karma and hopefully great flair. Cheers. ,makesyoumoist,d15fogi,2,t5_37kxn
