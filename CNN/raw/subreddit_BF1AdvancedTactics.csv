10695895,0,t3_5sn3ag,Just a note in BF revolvers arent really any better at range than the other sidearms. I like them but you might actually want to go for something like the good ol M rather than say the Gasser.Something for dynamite users to note. You will only destroy the light tank with three sticks of dynamite. to get the kill on the heavy tank landship or curiously the AT truck you need to set all three sticks and detonate with an AT grenade to reliably get the kill in one swoop.,BF1AdvancedTactics,ddj7a5f,2,t5_3i32c
