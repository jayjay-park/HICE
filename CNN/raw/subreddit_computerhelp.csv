2172098,0,t3_2jw1z7,Very simple rule on PC hardware. Because the industry is so competitive between the only two GPU makers they are always adjusting prices of their product lines based on how their different models are able to compete with one another. Which means essentially that performance wise you will get what you pay for or very close to it whether its an AMD based card or an NVidia based card.Unfortunately . cards are not going to cut it for the current crop of higher end games that push hardware. Although Crysis is a little older its still a game that demands a lot from your PC.Heres an article updated monthly by Toms Hardware on the best gaming cards for the money.Personally If I were you Id be looking at the . to . range. Even at this you wont be able to run everything on high in Crysis. It will likely mean a mix of med and high settings in this price range. If you want to run high settings I think youll have to bump up to . to ..,computerhelp,clfxbds,2,t5_2qmtf

5393230,0,t3_3ot988,I had plenty of connection problems with Comcast when I was using their wirelessroutermodem combo device but when I exchanged the hardware for a simple modem and used my own router I never had that problem again. A technician who came the apartment the check the cables even mentioned that their hardware can be hitandmiss she was pretty careful and chose her words well but she got the point across. I highly recommend going to a Comcast office instead of calling customer service and asking for a simple modem then use your own router. The physical offices have proved to be more effective than calling on the phone.,computerhelp,cw11mzv,1,t5_2qmtf

8245954,0,t3_4rub47,What are your main uses for it?Do you game? Look for a high write speed but only loading times will increase with no other gaming benefit.If you work with files a lot you want both read and write speed.If you use your computer casually it doesnt matter just go for space and price.You should have both an ssd and an hdd with your ssd for a few things that load too slow and your os while anything you just need stored goes on your hdd. If you only have room for one device you could go for a hybrid which can store I  the tbs and still keep a lot of the ssd speed.I just myself upgraded from a gb  readwrite speed to a gb  readwrite and I just went to best buy and bought one on sale since I only use it for game loading screens and my os.,computerhelp,d58at0f,1,t5_2qmtf

You could try the key combo CtrlShiftAltF and see if it brings up a password prompt For Deep Freeze Standard.Some other programs might require you to do something during boot up.Either way though youre likely going to need that password.
