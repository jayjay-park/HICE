This is especially true in poor weather or at night.Lights on during the day I didnt even know this was a thing. Then I looked at the other cyclists today and noticed  one school kid and one bloke in racing skins with their lights flashing.,ausbike,cqutzqd,2,t5_2wy6u
3939074,0,t3_35kiuq,gt Roads minister Duncan Gay wants to curb the dangerous and illegal lunatics who put pedestrians and other road users at risk I dont think that cyclists even stupid ones are dangerous and I dont think that they put pedestrians and other road users at risk on the same scale as dangerous motor vehicle operators. Im constantly disappointed with the political vitriol towards cyclists that to me seems entirely unfounded. ,ausbike,cr5ae6b,9,t5_2wy6u

10597941,0,t1_dd906at,Yeah the only one of the drivers complains I could agree with was the switching between bike lanefootpathroad rule. As for the others Lycra. The reason so many cyclists wear it is because cycling infrastructure is not built up to the point where anyone can use it. The people interested in cycling and likely to wear lycra will almost always be riding. The point of infrastructure is to get other people the regular commuters onto bikes. And how desperate are you for reasons to hate cyclists if their clothing is what upsets you? The infuriating overtake. Many times the intersections I use are specifically marked so that cyclists should always be at the front. One line of reasoning here is that many accidents used to occur at intersections because drivers would not notice cyclists as they werent expecting them. By putting cyclists directly in front it makes them more obvious. This is done by local councils and on purpose. Eco smugness. Assuming that we all still own V WDs sounds like the driver is trying to pin their own problems on someone else. And oh no social media. Rage comes from both cyclists and drivers and Ive yet to see any evidence that its more prevalent in cyclists. As for the right to use the road registration is not a road access fee no matter how anyone looks at it. Everyone is entitled to use the road legally and if you dont like that talk to your state department about changing the road rules.,ausbike,dd93gz3,3,t5_2wy6u
10598153,0,t1_dd93gz3,Yeah I get frustrated at anyone running redlights or jumping onto foot paths. I only advocate breaking the law if it is unsafe not to and you should be trying to avoid those situations.,ausbike,dd949c6,3,t5_2wy6u
