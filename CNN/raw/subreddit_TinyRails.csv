11435602,0,t3_6380pq, Roll are a waste of gems honestly. You can get plenty of rolls from adds and from towns. I think it is efficient if you are in early game and your cargo space is limited. Otherwise just buy everything.,TinyRails,dfs7pzz,1,t5_3hwzx
11512413,0,t1_dg0r7q1,When you want to stockpile items for late game use or clear out markets to get refreshes but know you will need the resources later its a cool idea.I can barely make a couple hundred thousand a day right now I wish I had . mil lol.,TinyRails,dg0xmor,3,t5_3hwzx
11514193,0,t3_64ci1f,Interesting idea.But I have to see how it would work with the monetization side of the game too. Since we just added gold bundles to the shop. But this idea could find a home in the steam version of the game maybe a new character too. We will see. D,TinyRails,dg14vw0,2,t5_3hwzx
