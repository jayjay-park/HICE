2077111,0,t1_cl3twho,Sysques documentation and user interface are sometimes cumbersome and hard to figure out. That being said its absolutely great for fabrication. Once you figure out the particular little preferences it has its the only way to do any BIM modeling IMO. ,Revit,cl3ugsq,1,t5_2s5k2

4372643,0,t3_3b1ae8,The quick answer is yes you can because Revit has built in the capability of drawings drawing views sections etc.  The long answer is it doesnt always show what you want to see because Revit is making the drawings from a model and all dimensions are true.  So there are workarounds and bestpractices for dealing with some situations.  Say you have a floorplan with several pipes stacked in D drafting you could note this but show the pipes next to each other for clarity and ease of dimensioning.  In Revit you cant move the pipes because they are where they should be in D and you cant fudge dimensions because again things are where they should be in D.  So more views and notes must be utilized for clarity.  That is at least until everyone ditches paper and uses the D models directly hahahaha... ,Revit,csij66x,2,t5_2s5k2
4560346,0,t3_3depww,If you are modifying the Family then you just put in the values you want for each parameter the formulas are only if you need several types or you need values to vary based on other values. If you are just modifying values of the family from within a project then you may need to open the Family and modify the values there and resave. gt Flanker Width  iforWidth  Width   Width    What this is saying if the value of Width is equal to   or  then the Flanker will  otherwise it will default to .  gtedit I just found the family types dialogue via the modify tab. Now I have access to the formula itself. How do I change it so that if the picture portion is ft the casement portion automatically becomes ft?You need to change these within the Family .rfa file and dont need a formula unless you have multiple windows of different types.  Just put Width   and Flanker Width  or whatever values you need.  ,Revit,ct5g67m,1,t5_2s5k2

6133077,0,t1_cyly69l,Thanks for your help! Ive literally just been sorting through unsorted families on a large project to create a tabulation. Bascially there were over  items that hadnt been given a type mark but the schedule grouped them as one.Had to painstakingly sort through each one to add a unique type mark. Im not too sure if my method was the only course of action but its done now. Any advice or tips are welcome Im sure Ill be posting a few questions very soon. Hopefully this is correct place to ask.Thanks!,Revit,cymrltk,1,t5_2s5k2
6155474,0,t3_3zqvco,In this case it may be easier to create a leader family and add them as needed.  you can nest a annotation family for the leader head into a line based detail component to create a leader family. ,Revit,cypb9ws,2,t5_2s5k2

6399932,0,t3_43agtz,What Revit version are you using?  Revit  currently has two different rendering engines. If you try the Autodesk Raytracer youll find it is MUCH faster.  Sometimes the final results are a little questionable depending on the scene but overall it normally does a fine job.A couple other suggestions.  Suggestion  If you are rendering with lights on either turn them off for the render you can select which lights you want onoff or select an rendering option without artificial light if you can get away with it while still getting the effect you need.Suggestion .... and yes this is going to sound weird.  Render it at a smaller size... then link the image into AutoCAD.  I know this sounds bizarre but Ive found AutoCAD often can plot images without losing much resolution.... at least at a distance.  Thus you scale the image up in AutoCAD to the exact size you need then print out the individual sheets on a plotter to make your banner.Its an old fashion work around that I discovered over a decade ago when nothing else seemed to work. I still use it once every three years or so.  ,Revit,czh3uv9,2,t5_2s5k2

7363191,0,t1_d2f27kl,This is the exact advice I give. Copying buildings around you is critical because it will force you to find modeling solutions for realworld building quirks. A friend of mine tried to teach himself revit but he tried to teach himself while making imaginary buildings. Specifically castles. Therefore he just continued to use the tools he was already familiar with. Walls. Walls for everything.On problem is that revit isat the end of the daya program for making construction documents.Its not all about D modeling. Its about  modeling  making that model look good as D line drawings on paper.,Revit,d2f57lc,8,t5_2s5k2
7471305,0,t3_4hok8n,I would say Ikea but theyre Swedish. Seriously though what do you wantneed your finished product to be? Youre doing a walkthrough looping through rooms hallways? What kind of project is ita stadium or a home? Do you need to do a photorealistic rendered walkthrough or would a shaded view suffice? Assuming its a home office or similar there are a large number of furniture families available in the component library that came with the revit installation and there are vastly more available for download online. What you can find online is often a mixed bag since theyre made by random peoplesome look good for renderings but arent functional for use in drawings some look good in drawings but suck for renders etc. I like Revitcity.com personally. Just search vanity in downloads for example and youll get a selection of bathroom vanities from boring to bizarre.  The star ratings and total download count are a pretty good indications of the quality of the object.,Revit,d2rfxvp,3,t5_2s5k2
7705632,0,t3_4ksmk2,All templates should be readonly as well as their subfamilies and saved to  a single folder that includes their subfamilies.  When someone uses a template and they go to edit a subfamily Revit will remember the folder the family was loaded from and default to saving there but of course it will get an error if the user tries to overwrite the readonly template.  Projectspecific subfamilies should then be saved in the same folder as the projectparent family.  The subfamily will then need to be reloaded into the projectparent for changes to show.  ,Revit,d3i2ux8,1,t5_2s5k2

8315990,0,t3_4sopha,Thank you all for your responses. I believe that a drafterdesigner creates about  of the total documentation that is submitted to the client. Think sheets. Currently in a structural steel CD package Im responsible for everything except for the defining beam sizes weld sizes calculations and general notes. Yet my pay is  of the rate that Im billed.  Does it really cost the company  of my rate to assist me in completing my job? I dont belive so.  For me to do my job I dont need to physically be in an office. The one element that my company provides to me that i havent provided for myself is a client to design or draft for.  I have a computer and can get a subscription to the software I need.

11071004,0,t3_5y0nxl,Mmmm. I know the feeling and I know how to avoid it.Start your project with a rock solid base. Put real time into your project setup. Make sure you wont be needing to rotate anything later. that you wont need to insert or remove levels later. Plan ahead. Dont fudge even the slightest bit at firstdont rush to show off how fast you can build.In the middle of your project there will be far fewer distractions and technical annoyances to chase due to your clean setup.And at the end of your project as you work on your sheets you MUST ask yourself how many places am I going to see this? Remember that youre paid by the hour. Will modeling a solution to a problem seen in one interior elevation be quicker that putting a masking region over the problem? No. Leave it alone. The ship that is your project is taking on water but youll make it to shore if you stop bailing out the boat and start rowing instead.No revit project can end cleanly. ,Revit,demvz71,5,t5_2s5k2
