4882226,0,t3_3hpy97,I find platforms quite helpful for Ike low ceilings definitely and even high ceilings so you could live longer. Most of the legal stages are actually pretty okay for Ike except for maybe Lylat cruise. I find Ike benefits from low ceilings more than anything so Town and City Halberd and Delfino are good counterpicks and Battlefield is pretty good for Ike as well with the platforms. Lylat fucks with recoveries so I say always ban it.,IkeMains,cu9xxrt,2,t5_393i0
