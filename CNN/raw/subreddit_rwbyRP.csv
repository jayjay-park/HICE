The pause is hardly even momentary. Keeran closes his eyes fully and pressures his hand slightly upwards against the back of Gingers neck drawing her face inward to his. He simultaneously clutches his other hand against the small of her back ruffling her dress slightly in his grip and with a flex of his arms he drags the rest of her body up against himself sealing their mouths together into a long slow kiss.The young mans lips lock over hers in a stomachfluttering instant as their mouths form together in a synchronized pulling motion. Keeran takes the girls lower lip between his own and kneads his head softly as he spreads his fingers through her hair. He gently settles among the girls roots as their kiss quickly evolves through its opening moments of effortless exchange.Keerans heart skips a small beat as he feels Ginger kiss him kiss him back her lips caressing softly over his.

At the flick of the switch located on the back of her neck all of it faded out the pain and sound dissipating instantly along with a lot of the color of the arena.As Kyohi started to close the gap the sound of a rifle ringing true rang out again though because of her senses Kyohi couldnt hear it only see the effects of it as her hand was almost around her sword before it sudden flung away a bullet striking it full force and knocking it far out of Kyohis grasp.Yield!

2879271,0,t1_cnuhios,There is a momentary pause between the two fighters as Syns weapon  is tossed away from her grasp. Isaac and Syn exchange glances both sides cool and evenheaded. A bit to Isaacs surprise the girl looks... relatively nonplussed by the loss of her weapon. With a casual pace Syns hand floats down to her left thigh and with an annoyed scowl she unclips a small scabbard flourishing out a sizeable combat knife with a flick of her wrist.The black metal of the blade shimmers slightly with faint white reflections as another glowing velocity seal warps into existence beneath Syns feet. The steely look on her face never drops as the arrow appears stamped into the ground pointing directly at Isaac and she is launched off her feet dagger poised against her chest in a reverse grip.Isaac meanwhile slams off his feet as he sees the seal form flipping Scorpion Wire back to his hip. His left hand clenches into a tight fist as he burns off another swath of aura and his body lights up like a giant tesla coil. The streaming arcs of blue surge together and collect at his fist in a blinding white flash as he charges to meet Syns assault head on. He plants his foot and swings with every ounce of power in his body colliding with the girl in a brilliant shattering flash of energy.A staggering upheaval of pressure sweeps through the arena as the pair are blasted apart. Isaac feels the sharp pound of a pointed blade slam into his sternum at what felt like fifty miles an hour the edge worn down by his aura but the concentrated force utterly unmitigated. Almost akin to being shot through the chest with a harpoon he is flung off his feet and goes flying directly into the updraft of the southern fan.Syn meanwhile is unlucky that Isaac is left handed. His punch rockets through the air as they meet each other and smears against her cheek with a jarring explosion of force and electricity sending another blast of crippling charge coursing through her body. The girl tumbles headlong like a ragdoll and slams into the wall of cover just adjacent to them. There is a deafening crack as she blasts straight through the protective material smashing the wall to bits as she rolls to a stop fifteen yards north coughing violently muscles twitching but hanging on.Isaac flings through the air for another ten seconds before finally making his way to the ground. His back claps loudly against the sleek surface jarring him utterly. The boy clenches his teeth just able to cling to his consciousness and force back the creeping walls of white that clamped loosely down over his vision.Elise glances down at her Scroll from her observatory position. Both students were in the red nearly knocking each other senseless with the exchange of semblancefueled blows. ...now was the time for things to get interesting. The silverhaired professor smiles loosely and presses a  small red button in the corner of the program and immediately the fans grow louder as the teacher pushes them into overdrive. The spinning blades upheave in pitch escalating into a deafening upwards vortex that utterly fills the arena practically lifting the students to their feet sans permission. It felt as if every point in the arena was now directly above one of the fans from before.MAP Lets decide the match with a Rule of Cooloff. Readygo.,rwbyRP,cnvdifv,2,t5_32s5j

The spraying bullets however make a situation neither student had prepared themselves for one of the small metal slugs hits the smoke grenade midair and the device explodes from the impact making a thick cloud of opaque grey smoke between the two limiting any sight of the other they had.uArtyomTheCat uEcirava ,rwbyRP,coxwimz,3,t5_32s5j

3505164,0,t1_cprn8kn,. Alright so my point in minmaxing was that with so many s in social attributes the character was going to be difficult to play but as you said its how you built the character so thats okay.. I havent rechecked your points yet but that should work well.. Everything here looks good.  We already have a bit of a steampunk character a professor that you should be aware of as your character would probably recognize him.  Because cybernetics arent really in RWBY you can kinda make your look for them to be almost however you want.  The fact that I also like steampunk totally isnt a factor I swear. Thats what I figured and think it works well with the character.  I will give you an example of a semblance that would work below the line. You can be older if you would like and that could even add to the whole aloofness thing.  But I wouldnt go any older than ...  which still isnt really appropriate for a researcher.. First of all thats agoraphobia fear of wide open spaces not of the sky.  The part where I was referring to her obsession with Grimm came from this line where you described a want to stop any more victims of Grimm attacks as a flaw.  The part on the mechanical stuff was just a reminder for the play of the character more than a critique of something that needs changing.Enhanced Cognition  Aura Pool PointsEffect Through an act of supreme concentration Alicia is able to use her aura to fuel her senses sounds become louder smells become more distinct and colors become brighter.  This semblance manifests in two different ways.  One is an over all sensory increase.  This will increase any check using her senses story teller discretion but an amount equal to her semblance score for  rounds.  The other way it can be used is to cut off all of her senses but one which becomes superhumanly strong.  The exact information garnered here will be up to the storyteller.  This can only be used when concentrating and she cannot move or act when its active but it can also remain active as long as she can maintain concentration.How does that sound?,rwbyRP,cprtamo,1,t5_32s5j

It was however one that Emilia could gladly admit to. Right from the time that she felt her insides lurch with a short sharp shock she had separated the hinge that kept the whip in shape the deerhorn knives quickly taking shape as she kept a tight grip on both in her right hand.Her mind was running at a mile a minute as she tried to think of all avenues of escape and with her current trajectory just as her Bolas would she would arc out of the way of the bridge into a freefall. There was a shadow of a smirk on her face as she thought up her plan in her head.She fought to regain her balance in the air the natural sway of the explosion giving her problems in doing so. With a gaudiushly subtle flash of iceblue Aura she felt her Semblances power run though her veins. It was only a boost and would only last a short while so she had a limited time frame to enact her plan.Once the explosion had subsided she switched the velocity of her whole body to completely reflect the other way back towards the bridge itself. She had a dodgy means of doing so but she shot a stabbing down motion into the smooth stone of the bridge.

3731745,0,t3_32nkja,Here are my notes on your character after all the updating so far Still not a fan of the floating hearts personally. I cant read.  Physical description is good enough in terms of detail but my biggest complaint is that the outfit shes wearing is something youd expect someone here on Earth to wear not someone in Rwby. How is she supposed to fight and kill Grimm in a peacoat and skinny jeans? As for the Weapons her daggers are made out of platinum which is a soft metal. That would be a bad thing to forge weapons out of. Everything else about it seems more or less alright but typically the more detailed you try to get incorporating real world stuff into your post the weaker it actually becomes. For all we know platinum doesnt even exist in Remnant. Semblance is really really poorly written and talks over itself a lot with overcomplications. She is able to take dust that her teammates are using and apply it to her own weapons. Done. Theres an issue with the part where  she can copy multiple types that she can switch between but the more types she copies the weaker they become? Because thats not actually true. It modifies her attack by her Semblance score no matter what it says it right down at the bottom. Save yourself the trouble and just take out the part about it getting weaker with multiple types. She can just snatch and grab whatever dust types are around her.Backstory Notes  First of all if Meis father was a huntsman who taught her about weak spots on Grimm give her a higher Grimm score in the mental skills section to better reflect that.  Her dad was a Huntsman. Why the hell would he have become a cashier once he got back to Vale? They haveneed huntsmen there too. That makes no sense. The robbery part is kinda dumb. It comes utterly out of nowhere and it destroys your character as anything anyone would sympathize with. She stole money effectively from her father who for some reason was not out hunting Grimm anymore and who also had not cleaned out the cash register at the end of the day? Change this to something else. Larceny   Steal all throughout my time at Signal and never got caught once. The stealing is silly anyway and just really heavyhanded in the way its just forced into her story. Its entirely unnecessary. Your character effectively pulls a highstakes heist by herself with Stealth  Larceny  knocks a guard out by pressure point with Brawl  and meanwhile has Subterfuge . This character is not built to be a thief. None of this fits into her backstory in terms of her stats nor any kind of sensible motivations. Just read the ending just no. This story makes less and less sense the more it goes on. There are so many absurd questions that this just throws up into the wind. Why on earth is Brant just chilling at his desk in the middle of the night? Why are there guards outside if hes there? Why are there guards patrolling if there is no artifact to begin with? Who in their right mind would admit to breaking into a school and knocking out a guard openly? Thats horrible thievery. Even moreso who the hell would reward that? Ultimately this all needs to change mostly because it leaves your character at Beacon for an utterly pointless reason. Why is she there? She didnt have any explained desire to go there she just wanted to steal for some profoundly unexplained reason. So why did any of that happen the way it did? It is just baffling. Try again on the backstory. You drastically overestimate your own characters abilities and its just painfully cliche and unrealistic.Personality notes Personality is fine just half of it relies on her being a thief which is poorly founded in her backstory and motivations.,rwbyRP,cqhn5k5,1,t5_32s5j

Here are a few supporting pieces of evidence why we do things this way. While rule of cool is the norm in RWBYRP there are limits set in place so that characters are not over powered. This way everyone is on a somewhat equal footing during combat. Others attempt to help a player improve their character so that it can enter the RP as soon as possible taking care of the obvious details so the Moderators wont have to waste time on them. Allowing them to focus on fine tuning the players character so they and everyone else will enjoy their character. Past players did cause restrictions to come up though for very good reasons. It prevents the RP from becoming a total chaos with OP characters that in the end do not fit within the RWBY universe. These are kept in place to set a standard that everyone can enjoy a decent level of stability within the RP.In the end it is your own choice whether or not you want to join RWBYRP if you dont like our standards then feel free to join a different RP that fits your play style.,rwbyRP,csu6u1e,5,t5_32s5j

After all its likely a wiser idea to do so seeing as how I A worked at a pizza shop and B used to eat pizza on a nearconstant basis. Whilst both statements were indeed true the wording that Isabeth used was a bit peculiar to those who remembered from when the girl was last readily seen on campus as before shed left a month prior she was indeed eating pizza on a daily basis and she still had her job.

Dana would always enjoy kissing Amethyst but there was something particular powerful about this feeling tonight...perhaps it was the rather romantic setting. Maybe it was the remnants of the exhilarating feeling of avoiding that camera.Whatever it was Dana had taken her time to thoroughly enjoy Amethysts red lips in their entirety loving the intimate contact with such an attractive girl but also the control placed upon her considering that Amethyst had made no attempt to pull away from the kiss. It was a rather powerful statement to show the true submissiveness that Amethyst felt to her master.Once the kiss was finished Dana took a small breath to calm herself smiling from their recent kiss. It seemed as though it accomplished its intended effect making Amethyst calm down into a more flustered state....only to return back to normal here the excitement energizing the petit girl once again.Cant win them all I suppose. She thinks to herself unconsciously licking her lips to gather what was left of Amethysts taste. Still her being this excited is really cute!Once Dana had gotten over their little intimate act she placed the marshmallows back inside the bag for later consumption before speaking to Amethyst once again.If the pet wants to explore her new habitat then by all means...the master will allow her. Dana approves of her decision her smile now more easygoing than lustful. Gazing into Amethysts eyes she paused before she spoke once again.But...since there will be no one here theres something that you must do before we can truly look around. She reached up with her  free hand to point towards the ribbon that currently hid her faunus features.I would like to see your ears and tail once again. Its only us here and it would please me greatly if you were to expose them to me.It was an honest feeling something Dana always loved to see on her pet. Her affinity for faunus features was as strong as always and Dana knew fully well how Amethyst felt about them....it filled her with a good amount of excitement that she was able to convince Amethyst to expose a feature that she preferred to keep hidden as it certainly helped cement the girls dominance in this taboo relationship.To further this reinforcement she squeezed her hand once again wanting to see them not only because she liked them but also to see her handiwork in cleaning them up for her.,rwbyRP,cu6sir6,2,t5_32s5j

Giggling a little from the unexpected drop but not regretting it in the least. Enjoying her experience within this magical place and loving that Dana had decided to bring her here.With a quick dexterous movement the violet girl flipped onto her back. Staring out into deep space and gazing at the beautiful star speckled sky. Splayed on the white tiled floor rather unevenly but it didnt really matter to her right now. Caring only to witness the majesty of her beloved stars in peace knowing that this was a place she wanted to visit often.grrroowwwlllA small groan broke the serene silence that filled their secret getaway for the evening. Echoing a tiny bit through the domed room since it was so quiet. Revealing to the violet pet and her Master that she was becoming hungry after her energetic play around the moonlit room. Finally feeling that it was time to eat some food from they had obtained from their earlier expedition.As such Amethyst rolled over a couple times before coming to a halt on her belly. Slowly raising herself onto all fours before crawling towards Dana rather quietly. Clearly happy based on the small smile across her face brightened light azure eyes that practically glowed and wagging bushy tail that stood up above her small form. Swaying excitedly with her remaining energy as she made her final approach towards the blanketed floor.Because of how erratic her action had been Amethysts long silky hair was completely disheveled. Strands of hair strewn every which way clinging to her light skin and form fitting clothes due to static electricity. Her chest was heaving lightly moving gently up and down as she consumed more oxygen. Strengthening her weakened and exhausted body that had begun to quiver from over use.

5776958,0,t1_cxd14ji,Argent from his tall spot could get a better picture of the city below him realizing something very important. It looked almost like how Vale was set up below the school if not for several places that he could identify as being in the wrong place such as the police department being now where the bookshop normally would be at. Still on his toes Argent let his aura seep out into the surrounding area around him trying to pick up on the tiny movement to see what it was. Suppressing it was another student making their way to an intersection not but two blocks away from where he was at currently however it was not the only thing that the boy could sense as well. Coming out from around a building three small looking beowolfs sniffed the air heading right for the student still hidden around the corner. Chiffon not wanting to take any chances made sure each step was deliberate and slow taking her time to study the buildings and layout of the road she was on. Pulling out one of her feather needles holding it between two fingers at the ready the faunus made her way down to the intersection hoping to find a way to the center of the city. However as she slowed down coming to the corner her back feeling the brick wall digging into her expose skin there were some sounds of rummaging around to her right. Slowly peaking out of the corner Chiffon could now clearly see three smallish looking beowolfs overturning cars and whatever else that was in their way looking for something as they sniffed the air growling at the slightest sound.  ucommunistkitten uDHDragon ,rwbyRP,cxd6plj,2,t5_32s5j
5785358,0,t3_3udeoj,Nice to see everyones havin some fun.Ambrose yawned a bit as he sat off to the side of the spectecal before him his rear firmly planted his chair as he watched the other students have their way about the room. The boy for once wasnt attending the affair in his old dress formals. Instead he had actually purchased a proper outfit A smoldering grey suit pants and bowler hat paired with a white dress shirt and darkblue tie. He held something similar to a cane in his hand though closer inspection may reveal that there was something... off about it.The cane lay off to the side settled atop a chair to his left. His hat found itself resting in his hands Ambrose playing with the felt slightly as he passed the time.Just like the Spring dance with Izzy... best nighta my life. And now Im stuck here alone and thats my fault too.The boys ears drooped slightly as he thought about his past relationships a sad disposition coming across his visage. Everyone I know seems to be gone now. Why am I even here still?Almost... got it... come on!Behind the DJ stand however a less sad scene was unraveling itself. Kaltrina was taking musical matters into her own hands having convinced the DJ to let her do a quick check on the electricals. The music for the whole night had been completely horrendous in her opinion nothing but slow dances and orchestral garbage that only the likes of Port would call entertaining. But to this the black dress clad rabbit had a solution. Splice into the music system and make the night NOT boring.Auntie Hannah always approved of the direct approach to problem solving...The rabbit Faunus went straight to work removing a pair of wire stripperscutters from underneath her dress and lopping off the cord which lead directly to the DJs central booth. She then took the cord and removed the insulation around it splicing a wire which had a USB connection into her laptop with it. With that little bit of work done the woman was now completely able to override the song selection her rig. A look of evil fulfillment was splattered all across the womans face as she found an alcove to hide her little controlbox from the public eye then started the sequence off with something a bit slow Something to... stagger the increase in pace.,rwbyRP,cxe88zd,4,t5_32s5j

5809780,0,t1_cxh7e0n,Ooh this is definitely a good one I actually have a character in the works who has one incredibly similar  and all itd take here is figuring out how you want it to work. Is it a pull think Scorpion style from MK or something that roots a person in place? With the whole biker thing chains do fit the motif its a typical biker gang styled weapon so just figuring out what you want them to do is the big part.Since you gave me all the other ones I might as well run down the list. While technically possible theyre really really hard to work out Id suggest something less complicated.. Perfectly allowable but theres the issue of Smoke Dust working similar to it.. Same this as above but with Lux Dust. This one does have potential I could see it working but there needs to be a lot of specifications with what it does.. Also possible but then it begs the question of what not just investing that in your weapon unless you have a thematic reason for it.. This one is the only one that gets a flat out no. Mental powers are something we really try to avoid me especially due to Semblances being explained as Physical manifestations of ones soul.

5909536,0,t1_cxtggbw,Cool so youve done a good job of solidifying her build a bit and everything seems to flow a lot better. Numbers wise youre actually only at  of your merit points so you could pick up another  point merit of something because otherwise it only banks as one freebie and that will poof once shes approved. The other one I wanted to point out was that you could easily take some sort of compulsion for the fibbing but Id only recommend it if you end up playing with numbers and actually need the  point or you really want it flavor wise I wont probably push at it too hard but when I look at her description again with her build and story I kind of expect her to be just a little more toned and built rather than skiny and light at only  pounds especially for somebody whos worked in farming her whole life. Its not big but I thought I would point it out. Weapon is good you may want to add something about a quiver to her combat attire because bow but this fits way better with her now. Semblance works for me being a physical caster the simpler moves fit well. The only thing I might suggest for the vine is to make the duration like semblance before she needs to pump aura to maintain. just because if you use it for grapples the pool will drain pretty fast before you get to do much with it at  Id call that fair since the most youll get is  turns at max semblance. The last major thing I have for backstory is that point where shes  and really gets turned onto being a huntress. The motivation and such is fine with me but I would like to see her maybe go to signal rather than just get some backyard training ever other week or so. She can keep all of her wandering from family to family and helping out on farms in her free time but I would like something more structured for her to get into the most prestigious academy in Vale.

She wants to learn to be more secure in her identity both as a fighter and as a faunus and grow from there instead of continuing to hide her true nature. Niles New Years Revolution is to get better as a fighter and get to be better about fighting with his teammates. He wants to be as great an asset to his teammates as possible even if that means throwing himself in the front to take the beating. Aside from this Nile has a distinct interest in getting better with his schoolwork including learning how to read better without all the letters getting mixed up in his head. ,rwbyRP,cyiio0w,1,t5_32s5j

He shrugs lightly.Figured itd be less embarrassing for us both if I played it off as my being the rapscallion in the moment and it kind of just grew into a sort of running gag from there I guess you could say.

Sitting on top of the sink counter was the opened steel suitcase with several cleaning supplies and maintenance tools for Kyohis arms strewn about and around the sink.There was also another much smaller case sitting on the opposite side of the sink. It appeared to be a makeup kit which wasnt entirely out of the question given that part of the girls combat uniform involved a profuse amount of white makeup covering her face. However this makeup kit also included a series of lipsticks and mascaras and a plethora of other toiletries.Finally sprawled defeatedly upon the bamboo wood floor lay Kyohi in a rather scandalous outfit. She was underdressed wearing an uncharacteristically set of undergarments both the top and the bottoms were made of a black lace material and her legs were hidden away in a pair of stockings which connected to a fine garter belt along her waist. Upon closer inspection one of the straps of her top had become stuck inside the coupling of her arm right in between the shoulder and the socket. She had apparently tried to remove said top without dismembering her arm and it was....unsuccessful.Her silky black hair was covering much of her face a last ditch effort to save her from the impending embarrassment.

Though of course that little moment was done and over with quite quickly when Lana questioned him. Actually no this is my first time seeing one of those. He responded. Oh so thats what it does. Here I thought they just put the wig on top of the hair normally.Right as Darya placed the comb into his hair he immediately got a bad feeling about it a feeling in which he was all too right about. Each swipe of the comb forcefully unknotted or plain ripped out his black hair causing him to wince in response and even mutter Ow every so often. So when the other student was done combing the teen let out a sigh of relief and noted to himself that he should go to a hair dresser after this.Alright. He said standing up along with grabbing the sides of his dress so he could walk properly. Beginning to walk over to where Lana pointed to him producing a low whistle just as the closets slide back into the wall and the room transformed. Okay that is freaking cool.

Argo stopped and tried to think of a good way to describe it.Imagine you could be in the best dance studio in the world but you could only ever dance one way. Only one set of moves even if you improved on them just those specific moves forever. Argo frowned slightly.If I had gone to Atlas and become a real engineer or scientist. I would have spent my life working on the newest line of drones or paladins or whatever but it wouldnt be the same. I would never fight with the things I make or get to see the world. I would have just been in a lab working on theories and blueprints. Argo shuddered at the thought.The world needs people of action not theory.

6691290,0,t1_d0bcoud,So serene is it not? The way it ebbs and flows the rising and falling of the tide. It is rather interesting how water works being totally enslaved to gravitational forces. As a result water always moves to the lowest point it can filling up any basins it must in order to get there. That is what the oceans are after all massive basins full of water. And all this subject to being pushed and pulled by the movement of the moon around the planet. Kris goes on about the water in front of them calmly walking about the water as if he was a narrator on some nature show. With a chuckled he leans forwards and sticks his hand into the river for a few seconds making a few motions and circles in the water. So warm this water is. Strange to think that this water is directly connected to the oceans up north by Atlas and by the sea at the very top and bottom of the world. There the water is much colder but still somehow warmer than the air around it. Curious is it not?,rwbyRP,d0bfs3w,2,t5_32s5j

6723860,0,t1_d0ec8jy,Zaffre paid close attention to what Charlie said was done while she was young. He chuckled a little at the joke but quickly quieted back down to gather all the details he could. He nodded as she mentioned the hearing being written off knowing how some doctors would accept simple solutions. He shook his head to her question questioning the truthfulness of his statement.I would never lie about possibilities. I loved growing up in Vacuo but unfortunately a number of the doctors accept the simplest answer without seeing if its right. Especially considering the fact you would have had so much else to work on. It can also be difficult to notice issues for the ear unless youve really studied it. Some of the parts look almost identical. He explained as he grabbed his otoscope and made sure it wasnt freezing as well as quickly disinfecting the tip. He then placed it in one of her ears and looked through his end. Im sorry it might still be a little cold. He apologized while examining the parts. He made a slightly curious noise before pulling the tip out of the half deaf girls ear and turning her around. He then quickly inspected the other ear seeing an almost identical sight. Once he was sure of the diagnosis he pulled back and let her turn to face him. He kept his face as neutral as he could to explain what he had seen.I can see why they wrote it off as congenital and said that it wouldnt be fixable. But I can honestly tell you...they were wrong about both parts. Both of your ear drums were ruptured at some point odds are when you were a baby and they healed naturally. Normally thats enough but whatever damaged them did it in an unusual way so it would have required surgery. Mix that with the fact it wasnt cleaned properly there was some damage done to the ear canal itself and odds are the cochlea was damaged a little as well it can easily look like a birth defect. The only reason I could tell was the different scarring patterns on them and the fact that Ive spent almost my entire life studying different conditions. But I can say with one hundred percent truth...Your condition can be fixed with a relatively risk free surgery.,rwbyRP,d0et0a9,1,t5_32s5j

She slowly squeezed the trigger her tongue sticking out of her mouth as she focused.ACHOOOO!!!! She sneezed out suddenly as a butterfly landed on her nose. The sneeze completely wrecked her shot. Fortune laughed at her and allowed her a single use of the great technique known as Rocket jumping. Unfortunately for both Wolfram and Amber neither of them were prepared for this once and a life time opportunity and were peppered by the shrapnel from Ambers weapon slamming into the ground.The only thing that could be heard through the large amount of dust kicked up from the blast was the scamper of little grimm talons along the ground. There were three sets of noise that amber would be able to pinpoint directly infront of her to the right and just behind her.

7315468,0,t3_4eyqg3,The first month shes out of Beacon Chiffon Merlot decides that she has a lot of people in her life that she needed to talk to. This trip takes her all over the world from Vale to Atlas where she met with her family and assured them that she would be well enough to continue as a Huntress now that she was out of school. Things were different at home. Her father was retiring soon her mother also discussing it. They wanted to move to Vacuo once they were sure that all of their affairs in order. It was warmer than Atlas after all. Her sister Lace was just a year younger than her doing an internship at a law firm somewhere in their home city. She always did take after their father Chiffon realized when she visted Lace quickly for lunch. Lace was a good fit for it she seemed secure in what she was doing. The twins were just graduating their combat schooling. Ingot wanted to join the Atlas Military though he was more interested in what sorts of work he could find in the field of robotics and what innovations he could do himself. Ore wanted to join the military too but he wanted to improve things off the battlefield. Someone had to train the medics he said when Chiffon went out with them for a night. Chiffon felt a bit of pride at this revelation.Cashmere was almost ten now and she wanted to be a Huntress like Chiffon. This was the biggest topic of interest to the young huntress so she took Cashmere with her on a short trip outside of Atlas to see the forests and that night they sat in the trees Chiffon telling her younger sister all about Beacon. She felt her heart stop a bit when her sister asked about going to Signal. She was too young for it Chiffon reminds herself. Chiffon promises that shell get her sister information about it and she heads home for the night with her little sister in tow. Chiffon leaves Atlas two weeks later having heard that someone she needed to talk to was all the way in Mistral exterminating some Grimm like they were nothing. Champagne Reynard was still as strong and elegant as Chiffon remembered kicking down Grimm with the point of her toe long orange and white hair streaming down behind her and pointed ears resting at the top of her head. When they meet for the first time since before Chiffon had gone to Beacon Chiffon almost doesnt know what to say to the woman that had taken her own as a student those years ago. Champagne greets her happily to Chiffons surprise and they start talking. Chiffon tells her everything. FCSA WYLT Ruas mentorship everything. Champagne doesnt comment on most of it just tells Chiffon that she looked better with feathers. Chiffons glad for that since it meant that shed be spared any derision for her actions when she was merely a fourth year. The compliment doesnt hurt either.Chiffon follows Champagne for a while helping the older woman slay Grimm whenever they came across the beasts but somehow the act of actually doing work as a Huntress wasnt quite enough for Chiffon. Shed thought this meeting and working with Champagne would clear up what she was supposed to do with herself after Beacon but somehow it doesnt. The third week that Chiffons with her Champagne sits the younger huntress down and they have a talk for the first time about duty. Chiffon had heard similar lectures in the past from Willow and from Rua but somehow when she was a student they never really sank in right. Chiffon doesnt expect to be told that Champagne had been in the same spot when she was younger. She doesnt expect to hear that Champagne had taught her because Champagne thought she was like her either. Chiffon expects to be told that maybe she should consider taking on a protege to help her figure things out least of all. They part ways once again Chiffon heading out in search of missions that she could complete while she thought on Champagnes suggestion while Champagne simply flits from job to job. Chiffon finds work in Vacuo guarding a caravan of performers as they travelled from village to village putting on shows. It makes Chiffons heart ache for the performances that shed do when she was younger dancing across stages and capturing hearts. On their third trip the caravan is attacked. Chiffon tells them to keep their heads down and does her best to dispose of the threat on her own. Some of the dancers even watch and when Chiffon signals that everything is clear shes inundated with questions. Even given an offer to stay with the caravan performing for them and protecting them in their travels. Chiffon agrees. It was stable work at least for a little while and being able to perform and do the work that shed trained so hard for did make Chiffon happy enough. However within a few years she was getting tired of it and wanted something else. The entire time shed had Champagnes suggestion bouncing around in her head. It was time to head back home.Chiffon waits at the top of the ridge as her protege follows after her huffing and puffing quietly as she climbed. She looks back over her shoulder watching as the bald girl that she knew to be her youngest sister followed after a estoc strapped at her side. Youll have to get used to this Cash. Chiffon says bored sounding as her little sister made it beside her. The bald girl looks up at her with wide grey eyes and nods. Chiffon doesnt frown only reaches out to gently pat her sisters shoulder before jumping down off the ledge landing silently several feet below. Hey Chiffon what are we even looking for? The smaller girl asks as she jumps down beside Chiffon landing with a bit of a thump. Chiffons eye travels over to her for a moment. Cash were looking for Grimm. What kind of Grimm?Chiffon reaches into a pocket that was sewn into her armor removing a black scroll with a faded green logo on it and opens it up bringing up an image of what looked like an ant its thorax torso and head white with everything else in black. Its called a Drone. Chiffon explains passing the old scroll to Cashmere who takes it into hand without much hesitation. Cashmeres brow seems to furrow a bit as she inspects the image then looks back up at Chiffon grey eyes wide. Isnt that dangerous?Chiffon reaches out taking the scroll back and folding it back on itself before stowing it back away under her armor. Yes She begins starting to walk forward again ahead of Cashmere occasionally pushing out her aura to see if she could pick up on the nest that was their target. But youre with me so well be fine. These are a cake walk compared to things Ive fought.Why are we looking for Grimm anyways?Chiffon doesnt look back at her sister merely keeps walking. You want to be a Huntress dont you?I... yes. Cash answers But why?This way youll be more ready for Signal than anyone else will be. Chiffon answers looking back at her sister over her shoulder crimson eyes soft. And you should know what the threat youre up against is. Cashmere nods walking behind her older sister and feeling impossibly small as she does so. Is Vale nice?Its nice enough Cash. Chiffon answers stopping suddenly pushing herself up onto the tips of her toes as she felt something get close to them. Cashs eyes widen a bit as she draws her sword staying close to her sister. Quiet. Cash nods following after Chiffon silently as the two approached a hill made from sand nearly the same height as them. She stops when Chiffon holds an arm out in front of her ready to fight as soon as things got serious. Chiffon steps forward as though she were expecting something and plucks something that looks like a long feather off of a belt at her thigh before throwing it forward. Cashmere feels her ears ring at the sound of the explosion that results from the fire dust loaded inside the needle. Ready?I think so.Show me what youre made of.,rwbyRP,d29pwhj,1,t5_32s5j

Her watery eyes listlessly watch the sand roll by her toes as she trudges along the long stretch of her footprints falling away from her heels trailing back to a faroff cluster of umbrellas. Though the day was searingly bright the girl was framed by a deep round shadow shaded by the form of a small grey raincloud bubbling about above her head.Little droplets follow the trail of footprints behind her not from any pattering cascade of rain but rather thick solitary droplets pludged into the sand in great sad gobs falling off the bridge of Klaires sniffling nose. The girls eyes were brimming her vision hot and moist as another chokey sob eeks out her chest.Dont look... dont look again. The girl commands herself as she feels her tattoos pulsate a deep cold blue through her skin. Youre just gonna make it worse and you know it...Her grip tightens feeling the slim coarse object fill her palm and another wave of cold sorrow wash down her back. Against her own better judgment the girl feels her teeth grit and her eyelids lift up from the ground. Her gaze trails up from the sand for the first time in ages to stare ahead... at the nowempty icecream cone that was still clutched within her grip. The sugary cone its rim still clinging to the edges of her lost dairy dessert only served to taunt her further. Klaires pitiful pout deepens as she stares longingly at the empty ice cream cone the world around her faded away in a blur of murky hot tears there was nothing but The Cone.Klaires sadness is brought to an abrupt halt as a tanned blob seeps into her path most suddenly. Distracted the girls reflexes hit a moment too late as she collides dead into Ras chest crushing the mushy cone into his stomach as their forms collapse together.Before the inconsolable girl could even scream at this large tan blob her attention is snagged by something else the hissing groan of Ras collapsing sand sculpture.Khurk! Klaire yelps as the halfton of sand avalanches into her back like a giant clay fist plunging her body horizontal and burying her both literally and figuratively into the large tan blob as the flow of sand swallows Ra and Klaire together.,rwbyRP,d4w5k12,2,t5_32s5j

I tried to be nice and charming no I was in fact nice and charming but it resulted in you insulting and getting pissy since you are trying to pass on the rage you have against yourself and your parents to others but since this doesnt change anything about the situation or about how you feel you just stay pissy all the time not realizing that maybe you are the fucking problem. It wouldnt matter if you were really gay and not just out of spite against your conservative parents and if I was a hot chick the outcome would have been the same even if we had sex you would still reject everything and stay a social outcast. I tried to be nice and open but all I got was hatred so of course I tried to have at least a little fun with this conversation and as you mentioned acted like a dick but at least I know how to properly conceal this have lasting relationships instead of repelling anyone who is interested in me so I am sorry for being interested in you not only sexually but as a person I am really sorry.

Growling with anger as it was smacked from both sides and already tired of the teens who had bothered its slumber. So without even giving either one time to react it sideswiped Dent this time around. Only it did not simply bat the boy away oh no it wasnt done yet. Bringing the teen around in  where he slammed him against Livius and threw them both away with a powerful bash of its massive paw.

Dissatisfied with their loss they used their entire political power to keep the Faunus confined on the island. When it was clear that the Faunus population is striving for the right to live outside of the menagerie they were one of the first to call to arms on the human side of the conflict and ended up responsible for multiple massacres on Faunus civilians.On that note there are also a few typos that snuck into her semblance describtion again sigh when I updated the CS the last time so Id like to fix those too during this edit.,rwbyRP,db5anog,1,t5_32s5j

If I never do any threads that involve him it may never come up but should someone meet him Id like him to have slight tremors and what not which gives her a reason to constantly visit home and potentially cause issues for her down the road.

Curved silver simple sword yeah? Named it Arianrhod after a... moon goddess in a... book series I like. He cleared his throat. The greens all wind dust carries it back to me when I throw it. Speaking of which With the flick of his wrist Velius brought  Arianrhods second blade around so it ended in a doubleended throwing blade. Far more comfortable when I can keep my distance. Although with a sniper rifle I bet you can empathize. With a similar blur of motion Arianrhod was flipped back into its singleblade form and tucked away in its sheathe as if it were never in Velius hand. Simple but efficient.

He then stopped the water from flowing and collected it all into a softball sized ball on his right hands palm also now slighly glowing the cerulean color letting his left hand drop as he did so.

This changed however when Cammie tackled her. Being caught off guard due to her laugh by the time she could react the taller girl was already slamming into her knocking the both of them to the ground. Normally this would be just an inconvenience one that Kelly would naturally complain about but would otherwise have no issues with. But the pilot came out of the hotsprings and in the places where the two girls bodies touched each other the mosture transferred between them causing the redhead to feel the same sting of the cold that the Mocha skinned girl did even if it was localized to a few locations.

10407525,0,t3_5p0yu5,Okay Im going to quickly help you out here while Ive got time. For his name I should point out that we do require proper names if he has a nickname thats fine but we dont allow people to simply not give their characters actual names. For numbers as far as I can tell youre currently sitting at  points meaning youre  under. I do have some things I will be discussing about the numbers in later parts so those numbers may not be the same after going through it. In terms of his weapon Dustinfused Weapon is a merit not a Weapon score.  For Advantages youve got a few things wrong Health is  and not  frail frame Aura pool is  which I should mention in combination with him having Aura powered means hell most likely be knocked out immediately if he uses any Aura abilities Armour should be  initiative is  and theres no  thats for light weapons Fighting Style only and the  to auditory is only a thing if you have Hard of Hearing as a flaw.  For attacks his brawl should be either  if his weapon isnt a brawl weapon or  if it is a brawl weapon as frail frame lowers all attacks by one. The Blade Projectile attack doesnt appear to have any attack combination behind it and if it is intended to be a ranged attack itd be  if thrown . All the attacks afterwards are also attacks not recognized by our system only attacks made with the brawl melee weapons athletics or ranged attacks are usable without taking certain levels in fighting styles and you dont have any of the Fighting Styles that give alternative attacks. For Semblance Im going to have to flatly inform you that your Semblance will have to be changed. We do not allow absolutes when it comes to Semblances and absolute protection from being able to be killed very much so falls under that rule. One thing I do have to note in the physical appearance is that an average build is directly in contradiction with having the frail frame flaw as FF directly states your character is unusually small in stature. In terms of his clothing the vagueness of it hurts it whats so special about his coat? His jeans? Its always important to make sure theres unique identifiers for your characters appearance so they dont feel dull.  With his face being burned something that appears to be fairly central to his character the fact that you never discuss it here is a bit of an issue it should be touched on in a fair amount of detail if so much of his character is devoted to it. So going into the weapon youve got quite a bit here that I do want to discuss. Firstly Id like to make sure youre aware that despite saying theyre hidden blades you wont actually be getting the benefits of hiding them as Light Weapons  is required for that function.  Moving from that Im confused as to whether the knives or this chainsaw apparatus within his sleeves is the weapon the knives seem to be disposable which in turn makes the choice to have returning weapons an odd one so Id like it to be cleaned up a little more to more accurately explain what his weapon is. In terms of it being Dust powered be aware that Dust Infused Weapon is a merit that you must pick up in order to gain any effects of Dust within the weapon. You can still say it runs on fire Dust but it will have no mechanical benefit until DIW fire is taken.  Ill admit here the last two paragraphs kinda lose me. The knives appear to have some kind of incredibly advanced explanation as to why they explode and I would like to both advise and caution you that over explaining things can lead to problems. Id recommend cutting down heavily on the amount of detail and explanation that goes into explaining why these knives are exploding and simply state that they explode on contact.  The entire last paragraph of the weapons description could honestly be cut it simply goes on to discuss ways the weapon is similar to things or how the weapon can be defeated. This really isnt the place for that. Okay so starting out the first thing Im going to bring up is how the initial loss of his mom and village comes a little too quickly we have no reason to care at all that his mom is dead or that his village is burned because we have no depth to either. No names no descriptions no real actions or interesting aspects aside from being burnt down or hiding Redcoat in a barrel. Death and Destruction is a powerful tool when it comes to characters and making sure theres adequate build up to it happening is important. It also brings to question where his father went hes got to have one right?  Another quick note Grimm is both singular and plural. One Grimm many Grimm. Grimms isnt correct grammar.  Okay so the whole thing with the Huntsman showing up is kinda odd why would the Huntsman just straight up burn his face? Its even stated that the Huntsman is surprised Redcoats still alive. So... whyd he do it? Huntsman are as a general rule good people and pointlessly potentially if Redcoat had died igniting a kids face really doesnt fit the narrative of what Huntsman are. Is it really not possible that maybe the Huntsman had bandages? A spare shirt? Something to wrap Redcoats face with instead of burning him without any real belief that the kid would survive?   Im confused as to why he just gets carted off to an orphanage just like that even disregarding the obvious emotional and mental trauma that wouldve happened from his village and face getting melted I cant really see Beacon shipping a kid whos survived what he has off to an orphanage the way he is. The referral to him as a subFaunus is odd to add as hes very clearly not a Faunus. Im also going to quickly state my personal opinion on the fact that getting bullied by orphans is just... its getting picked on by a group thats on one of the lowest rungs of the ladder when it comes being bullied and it always rubs me the wrong way when even after being orphaned the character needs to get kicked yet again by being bullied by orphans.  Im making this part its own paragraph because its pretty important to talk about the line But his damaged brain didnt allow him to recognize he was being bullied and any relation to this idea of him having a damaged mind will need to be removed both explicit and implicit parts. Our banned list is very clear on our stance on mental disabilities of any kind as this one will fall under.  With him leaving the orphanage thats mostly all fine and well aside from the whole cant even recognize faces thing but I covered that above the fact that his signature important and very apparent mask that appears to be quite central to his character is just scrounged out of a dumpster bugs me a bit. This should be something important for getting and oh its from a trash bin cool! doesnt really make it feel special in any way. At the least Id like for it to be a little more interesting a find.  Okay so him being kidnapped and beaten by Faunus for just hes human irks me as that kind of thing should be established much more than a few sentences. We tend to be very heavy on darker aspects and require them to be properly set up and justified as far as Im aware getting attacked doesnt do much of anything to shape him any further than he already has been.  Moving on why does this one village accept him? His whole motif up to this point has been that no one wants to deal with him unless its for violent means so whats special about this village? And why doesnt he have a name? Theres no real reason for him to not actually have a name at this point would he have forgotten it? Why? With no ties or anything to his life when he had a name theres no storydriven reason to keep him nameless.  So one year ago he applies to Beacon. Why? How? Up to this point theres been no discussion about his training combat abilities or anything that could really explain why Beacon would be interested in a kid from a village. The reason your character becomes a Huntsman is arguably the most important part of a characters backstory so it should be explained to the best of ability. Okay so... his personality section does a decent job of explaining who he isnt. The only thing we really get from this is that hes tough to read and kinda wanders around. That doesnt really explain who he is so we need to get this worked out to something that more accurately explains who he is.  A big thing I want to touch on now are his numbers specifically flaws and merits. How is he reckless? Why is he a Grimm Hunter and what is his favoured hunt? Why is that his favoured hunt? Whats his speech impediment? Why is his semblance at max value? Why does he have such high composure and such low manipulation? All this stuff is important to discuss as it gives us insight into the character and makes it easier for us to come to the decision of if he should be approved. The notes are honestly not needed here with the disfigured face one youre giving your character some pretty hardcore advantages at  cost which is never allowed and the rest of the notes are things that are apparent from the number distribution on your sheet.,rwbyRP,dcnrebj,1,t5_32s5j

10492381,0,t1_dcxac5m,Magenta was surprised by how Jay flipped them both over but didnt mind it as her hips bucked with his member. In response Jays request to go harder Magenta allowed Jays bucking and tightness to please him as he began to pant lightly while also calling out Jays name on the occasion.Magenta matched his thrusts with Jays bucking of her hips as his member began to twitch and grow in response to Jays pleasure. All the while Magenta began to pepper Jays neck with kisses until he felt himself getting closer to an orgasm as well. You feel so tight... Im not gonna last any longer. Magenta whispered into Jays ear before deciding to go into one last spurt of energy into thrusting inside of her. So he placed a hand on towards her face and looked into her lustful eyes with a smile on his face.Kiss me for the finale. We dont stop until were both pleased. Magenta said before interlocking lips with Jay and starting to dance around with her tongue more lustfully truly doing his best to make this their best moment. His hands ran through her hair a bit before eventually resting them firmly on her hips. He then began to thrust harder and harder into Jay as his member felt like he was getting close. Tiny beads of sweat began to drip from on top of his forehead as he subtly began to go faster and faster.Eventually he decided to go into maximum overdrive as he began to thrust his hips very fast into Jay and very deep as it constantly kissed the entrance of Jays womb. Eventually after about  to  seconds of thrusting Magenta felt it coming so he bucked his hips and placed his entire member inside of her hoping she would climax as well with him. While lip locked he then began to shoot his semen inside of her trying to coat her insides white to mark his scent on her. All the while he let out a moan of pleasure. Eventually after all that was said and done Magenta let go of the kiss and just stared into Jays eyes with light pants with his member still inside of her acting as a sort of plug for their fluids.

So within a moment the woman had tensed her legs primed her muscles and launched herself forward with all the power she could muster!At the same time Rio was struggling to see a silverlining sure he was free from one physical rope but now he was on a proverbial last string as he was compromised. His lone eye glanced up to see Cammie rushing in for a vicious attack counting the few seconds he had left and frantically exploring what options were available. In Rios rush he came across a plan and an incredibly risky one at that but it was all he had left and he was desperate to avoid the impending attack.It was at the moment Rio began to push up from the ground that Cammie leapt high into the air pulling her beefy arm back in preparation to thrust her propeller blade into the back of the edgelord enemy. Just as it seemed all hope was lost a dark blue wave pulsed from Rios chest sending a non lethal blast of auric light outward that did nothing to harm the other student. Though what followed the pulse was significant as a bare millisecond after Cammie brought her blade to bear onto the desperate teen his crouched form was enveloped by the same dark blue glow.

After Ceru and Iris completely disappear into the woods Ferrous immediately waves for the girls to follow him. Our way will be easier but we must make sure to keep a lookout for any potential guards for this camp the Huntsman comments simply as he walks. I trust the two of you to keep yourselves from attracting any undue attention to us.The initial walk honestly isnt that bad the rough terrain makes walking a little harder than it needs to be but after a minute or two of a rather steep climb the walk flattens out to light tree coverage along a fifty foot drop into the woods below them. Despite the open space and clean sound all three keep watch for anything that might spell misfortune for their trek.Luckily there doesnt appear to be anything nearby be it Grimm or man. The walk is actually rather calming allowing Sable to calm a bit of the nerves that had been building up since they got off the Bullhead. Taking in the cool air of the more northern part of Vales outer reaches the three move at a steady pace keeping eyes on the path before them in case someone or something should show up.mapCharacter| Despair|Sable uDekktheODST Violet uRawrMan Ferrous| ,rwbyRP,denfawg,2,t5_32s5j
11110011,0,t1_deqingr,continuing his circle around the blue haired brawler letting out another huff at the names being attached to them He began to lament the fact that if he didnt keep up his jukes then he was going to have issues with zaff breaking through his defense gritting his teeth and bracing himself he flung a fist forwards in the vain hope that hitting him might happen though either way it was actually going to move the fight forwards rather then this stalemate.Brawl attack,rwbyRP,derb6h2,2,t5_32s5j
11130144,0,t1_deqdnfv,Velius gritted his teeth against the blow a confident grin forming on his face as he realized his aura was still holding strong. That smile was quickly chased away as he saw the shotgunner blast passed him and he heard Orin nearly buckle under the hail of lead. Without even considering the brawler Velius roared as he rushed from his cover his vision tunneling on the one that dared to blast his partner. As his aura started to flare around his hands his roar grew ever louder as he brought his blade and his semblance to bear with all of his might.Free Activate Lunar Guardian.

11130483,0,t1_deqk36p,Nick was beginning to struggle at this point but tried to not show it. He could definitely lift it but for this long without any much help was a lot. Well yeah they need somewhere to throw all the trash. Other than the floor that is. Seriously how do so many people here live like that? He wasnt in a position to be able to judge other people on being messy but he did anyways. Hey theres one over there. Just have to toss it in now. He started to walk over to the bin fairly sure Ra would follow.,rwbyRP,detmpd8,2,t5_32s5j
11166316,0,t1_dew4ub5,Hmm? Oh no Im fine... Just dandy. Ashton tried to wave off the concern he was receiving from Kris giving the cyclops a fake smile as to attempt to sway him. Just... ummm... ahhh... Homework on the mind. You know Oobleck giving us a ton as per usual.,rwbyRP,dexouvs,2,t5_32s5j
11218706,0,t1_df3gjdl,Leif winced as Rez raised her voice. Alright she did not know. Man I sure hope shell understand if I explain it to her... Leif knew he had to answer her but he was not ready to tell her one of his most sensible secrets if she was unable to show compassion. Mentally he strengthened his stance and looked at RezI have to fight in this tournament and I was told that the registration was closing in ten minutes when I wanted to ask about it. I asked the registration lady if you were already registered and after I heard you were not I sorta faked your signature with mine. Thats why we are partners now. I hope you forgive me for this after all otherwise you would not have the chance to participate. Besides I have no scroll so I could not have texted you.Leif sighed and looked down as he was preparing himself to get scolded at.,rwbyRP,df3mk6z,1,t5_32s5j
11250983,0,t3_609mv4,Piper mindlessly puffs away on her cigarette with a look of mild disappointment on her face. Well shit how am I supposed to participate in this grand tournament if I cant even get a team? She looks around at the crowd of people around her. She lets out a sigh and decides that she might as well pick someone to fight she was rebellious but she wasnt crazy enough to go against Elise. She raises a hand up and pointed her fingers in the shape of a gun and spins around on her heels as she counts down. Three.. Two.. One.. Bang. She lowers her thumb pointed at a rabbit faunus in a lab coat. Hey egghead I dont really feel like facing the wrath of Elise so you wanna go a round with me?,rwbyRP,df7a6ew,1,t5_32s5j
11277071,0,t1_devf91v,I did see that but Im still confused what you are trying to do here. Fuchsias words didnt exactly reach Topaz the tigress way too lost in her own thoughts and talking. Upon getting yelled at the fox Faunus lightly leaned back and twitched her ears in irritation. With a long sigh she gave up on trying to talk against her training partner and just accepted that whatever she was on about it was important enough to ignore her entirely.When the robot hand latched to Topaz ankle Fuchsias alarm bells went off. Quick on her mind she wrapped an arm around the girl to make sure she doesnt get yanked off by what she was about to do next. Her boots hammered down on the head of the robot hoping it would be enough to stop it.,rwbyRP,dfa8my5,1,t5_32s5j
11283065,0,t1_df9vsq9,Crina looked around for a bit before smirking a bit at the challenge which Cammie is giving her and decided to play her game. Her grip on Nymphaea Stellata grew tighter as she spun around lightly on the balls of her heels and quickly bounced into rhythm as she hid herself behind a building and got herself into rhythm.Meanwhile Cammie had just slid down to the edge of the corner and took a small peak from the building to try and spot Crina. She readied her helicopter blades as she was looking for an unsuspecting stoat. However she had come to the realization that she had found nothing at all. So she went back behind the building and took a deep breath realizing that the both of them were now hidden from each other.MapCharacter | Health | Aura | Status|||Crina Luminitauravenluna  | HP | AP | Expression to either Initiative or Speed.

11312702,0,t1_dexwx91,This is not good... Steele thought to himself as he found his entire body numb. He reckoned he still had some time before he drowned but that time would still run out at some point. As such he decided his best course of action would be to get out of the water as fast as possible. After deciding this he poured all his willpower into moving his body under the water hoping to head towards what he presumed to be the edge.FIRE EVERYTHING Get outta that water heading north,rwbyRP,dfe9zfv,2,t5_32s5j
11425175,0,t3_62pvs8,Fear is an emotion that Nicholas takes on in many ways. Some forms throw him into anger trying to prove that they cant hold him down anymore. Others can make him charge in head on knowing that he can take on whatever it is whether or not he actually can. In his mind if he can conquer his fears just a bit at a time eventually he can take on anything.There are other occasions however that cause him to be thrown into a stuttering anxious mess. One of his constant things is his constant need to have everyone within reason have a good view of him. If he is put in a situation where he is being watched and out of his element he often freezes up too scared of failing to actually try. If something in a social situation does happen to go wrong he may collapse internally into an internally screaming mess. I guess you could say that in a way Nick is scared of failure but his reaction ultimately depends on the situation.,rwbyRP,dfr15zl,1,t5_32s5j
11480626,0,t1_dftz8eg,Alright then. Hopefully by then the guys would have moved the boxes in. As Leif was in the kitchen the boxes began to quickly get into the dining hall. Kyle of course remained on guard as he used a couple of rocks and whistling to get the students away from the boxes. Eventually all the food was inside and the only things that needed to be put in there were utensils and paper products. Kyle took a sniff as he smelled the chicken and the sauce of what Leif mentioned.Well that smells really good. Probably better than what my teammates could make. Thats actually saying a lot. Kyle said as he took one of the boxes while noticing the famous chef accent probably wanting a good opinion on the box. He then pat a seat on an outside table figuring Leif could use a break and relax before going back to cook for them. I never thought I get to eat something that smelled this good. Even back at Smallbright. Most of it was just food rations and bars which had no smell to them at all.,rwbyRP,dfxbqxc,1,t5_32s5j
11629275,0,t1_dge6twv,For the rest of the day Aurel instantly ran over to whatever bullhead would land in Vale eagerly awaiting Fuchsias return. After the last bullhead landed in the evening she was still nowhere to be seen. With a twisted gut he tried to sleep hoping maybe by tomorrow something would change. Early in the morning a knock woke him and his team up and he ran over to the door eagerly hoping to see her return. He was greeted with the sight of the more than ancient headmaster Ozpin who only gave him a silent headshake. He handed over a letter and a locked box with a key to Aurel and told him he can come to his office should he ever wish to talk then departed.Hello Aurel.I sincerely hope you will never have to read this. If I fell during my job as huntress which Im afraid is the case by the looks of it there is a few things you have to know. After graduation my team scattered into the wind and while I spend a few years with each of them we never managed to form it again and I ended up returning to Vale only to feel like a relic of the past. If it wasnt for Elises request I wouldve left the kingdom again by now but she saw something special in you dont let her words get to you she actually thinks highly of you she just doesnt sound like it so I agreed to train you in my free time. As weird this may sound now you were like family to me a son I never had maybe its hard to describe it. I just wasnt good at showing it. There are many regrets I live with but you arent one of them.The Wallenstein mansion now lies empty. Its yours. So is the notebook in the lockbox. It contains all the crazy designs my brother and me had for weapons back in our youth along with the ideas for Valkyrie you gave me. Im sorry if all those words are clumsy these kind of letters were never my strong suit. Im sorry.FuchsiaA few days after what happened a minor change happened to Aurels dorm room. The sign saying Aurel Gunther was replaced with Aurel Wallenstein.OOC Notes.Wew that spiraled out of control entirely. Whoever reads this will probably think But this is Fuchsias death story why is Aurel An NPC we have never heard of and was barely born by the time of our canon such a huge part of it? A lot of thought went into that. Fuchsias character growth is rather abstract but there are many instances throughout the story where it can be seen to shine through. Like with her banter with Aurel her general attitude the fact she just outright curses at the end etc. I felt making the story about Fuchsia alone would rob her of a lot of the growth she experienced over the years and would fail to show how much warmer she grew as a person. Current Fuchsia doesnt protect people because she cares about them per se but because she is very selfcentered and just refuses loss as part of her life. Her relationship with Aurel is selfless she has overcome that part of herself. While she is still willing to die to protect somebody it has evolved far beyond the primal NO she just displayed during her time at Beacon. An NPC she has no connection or closure with wouldnt do that justice and her current team and friends are still evolving too much to use them in a future like that.Im also aware her actual death isnt displayed or shown. I had the feeling this is much more about how she gets to the point where she dies rather than just how she dies.,rwbyRP,dge6vqd,3,t5_32s5j
