872885,0,t1_ch1p7f5,I did some reading to get specific names of parts so I can describe what is going on better. and I looked up the specific model of my mower so you can see that the blade is somehow when engaged allowing my motor to run It is an HR  MZAM SXA . So to restate the ROTOSTOP lever is not supposed to be depressed when you pull the pull start string. In the case of my mower the string is very hard to pull unless you depress the ROTOSTOP lever then the mower starts fine. The name is confusing of the ROTOSTOP lever because when it is not depressed the blade should not be turning.,lawnmowers,ch3i1nu,1,t5_2swwu
3522173,0,t1_cptqvvz,Also do NOT try to sharpen this yourself. It needs to be sharpened on a proper sharpening lathe for reel type mowers. If your local mower shop doesnt have one ask local golf courses. Youll have to talk to the greenkeepers. The reel can be sharpened in the mower but the bedknife cutter bar on the bottom will have to be removed. The bedknife should also be sharpened. Its a delicate touch to adjust the reel and bedknife and then it should be backlapped to ensure a good smooth cut all the way across.,lawnmowers,cptr4no,3,t5_2swwu

5581639,0,t1_cwoy2ud,They sell garbage with different name badges on them that are almost all owned and made by MTD. Garbage that will last maybe  to  years. Do some research go to a dealer pay more up front and get something that will last  years or more with proper maintenance. If its pushmowers a person is in the market for I suggest they look at Xmarks professional pushmower. It is the one I would buy if I had to buy one today. ,lawnmowers,cwoycze,1,t5_2swwu

I replaced it with same capacity as it was before which is max.According to my friend the reason why the clutch was slipping was because of the w.,lawnmowers,d203iwv,2,t5_2swwu

8270183,0,t3_4spy3e,I would highly recommend replacing the battery and seeing where that gets you. It sounds like it doesnt have enough power to turn the engine over that plus it quitting on you usually means a bad battery. If you can turn the engine by hand then there isnt anything restricting it enough that the battery shouldnt be able to start it up  keep it running if the battery is good.,lawnmowers,d5bbxvn,2,t5_2swwu

11463036,0,t1_dfqkioq,I cannot up vote this enough. OP mentioned a steep slope.  Do not get the entry level series from the big box stores.  The trans WILL fail within a few seasons.  Worked at a Deere dealer for  years and towards the end I worked closely with the mass market customers who bought a Deere and were pissed when it didnt last  years on their  acre slope. Edit I live on . acres and about a mile of it is a sloped bank.  I purchased a ZR with a  deck two seasons ago.   ,lawnmowers,dfvbtic,2,t5_2swwu
11543301,0,t1_dg4fc8r,Yea hopefully it helps. Not sure why it fires the first time but not the second time around for mowing. If you use the mower a lot then change the oil each year. Clean or replace air filter when needed. Make sure outside of carburetor is gunk free and linkage is clean. Also when you winterize and run it completely dry leave the cap loose so any residual fuel will evaporate. Like I said before when I run it dry after it has died I will choke it and pull it over until it absolutely wont sputter anymore. ,lawnmowers,dg4fnvy,2,t5_2swwu
