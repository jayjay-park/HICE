10913792,0,t1_de5n0h1,Well it all depends how hard the questions are doesnt it?Some exams take the approach that you have been taught all the material so as long as youve paid attention you should be able to get almost all of them correct.Some exams take the approach that the questions should stretch you beyond the taught material and see how you can apply it to new ideas.,cscareerquestionsEU,de5ohwv,3,t5_3j6s1

11106787,0,t3_5y9usl,Are there even HPC jobs around your area? I mean sure there are HPC centers and some companies do simulations with their supercomputers. But I just dont see job postings asking for HPC people. Either they dont need that many people or they dont hire strangers.  Also keep in mind those HPC centers employ quite a few PhD already. You need to compete with them and other scienceengineering people who knows programming.  ,cscareerquestionsEU,deqy0ri,1,t5_3j6s1
11110113,0,t1_deqy0ri,Actually the position I am currently in is closely related to HPC well its actually more scientific computing. My current employer has a joint venture with a HPC center. Although it still doesnt mean I can touch the hardware the software simulations still need to be written.gt Also keep in mind those HPC centers employ quite a few PhD already. You need to compete with them and other scienceengineering people who knows programming. I actually looked up the join venture party and they actually have explicit vacancies for these positions. I do however admit that I partially misunderstood the definition HPC while I did expect some connections with parallel computing I mainly thought HPC was about software performance optimization such as memory profiling. I did not expect it would also involve the hardware architecture as well.,cscareerquestionsEU,derblhj,1,t5_3j6s1
