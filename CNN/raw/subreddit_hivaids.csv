1890961,0,t3_2g8mso,First I hope you are aware that HIV and AIDS are not the same thing. And in either case they are still normal. AIDS means that HIV has destroyed your immune system leaving you vulnerable to a variety of maladies that healthy people usually dont get.So are you looking for photos of people with HIV or specifically people who have progressed to AIDS? I think it would be a great prevention campaign to show photos of people living with HIV. Because they look healthy. A lot of people I talk to dont think protection is important because the person they sleep with didnt look sick. Although I imagine it would be difficult to get people to volunteer for that sort of thing. HIV is still heavily stigmatized.Are you going to use the photos for something specific? Or is this for personal reasons? I dont know of any specific blogs or photo sets but you could try thebody.com...they may have something.,hivaids,ckh1w8k,1,t5_2sabe

Others have Have you ever been tested for HIV? as an exclusionary question in the application.

11002128,0,t3_5x0qsc,I got my diagnosis in .  It was essentially a death sentence.   There was only one med AZT taken in high dosage every  or  hours. People on AZT were dying right and left.  Within a couple years more NRTIs were introduced.  We who were taking multiple NRTIs were still dying right and left. Over time different classes of drugs were introduced which meant that the death rate slowed markedly though a lot of people still died even on the new HAART regimes. Today its almost trivial to maintain undetectable viral load. Nobody dies from HIV anymore.   And man the hysteria. I had to search to find a dentist who would accept me as a patient.  It was dangerous to  tell anyone.  People were getting fired evicted or tossed out by their parents refused treatment by EMTs and even some nurses and physicians. We were shunned shamed pariahs.        Youre going to be okay fine.  Take your cue from Mack Beggs My masculinity HIV doesnt define who I am Beggs said. I define who I am.   For values of nobody equalling people receiving treatment in the advanced nations that is.   ,hivaids,def24wi,8,t5_2sabe
