I cant remeber them actually talking about epistmological subjectivty contra epistemological objectivity. But i might recall wrong how are they related to what i write would you say woudl you care to elaborate?I sort of agree with Wittgensteins rebuttal of cogito ergo sum but i also acknowledge that Wittgenstein partly deconstructing language in his rebutal but of course so does cogito ergo sum really so in a sense and as such Wittgenstein only points out the paradox of the statement of cogito ergo sum. Though i do think that cogito ergo sum is a good way to describe a form of tacit knowledge that this paradox sheds light upon. But then again what does this leave is in the sense of the meaning of knowledge and truth? I do not se why the knowledge that cogito ergo sum points out be it tacit or not would be objective or absolute or universal. Sure i consider that knowledge a fundamental truth but that is far from the same thing as a universal truth. It is in fact a very subjective truth i would dare to say though i consider that knowledge tacit.,dabbalism,cp96k6x,1,t5_379mm
