1148886,0,t1_chyuun5,Thanks this was my third time in NYC so I pretty much knew my way around and knew what I wanted to see and do I felt like at home.This is just an excerpt of my photos I have a lot more but did not want to burden you.As you could slightly see in this album as well I am a huge NYC subway enthusiast so a rather large portion of my photos is from subway cars stations the signage also street and traffic signs etc.EDIT I stayed in Brooklyn but I would go there regardless. I had my points of interest in Manhattan Brooklyn Queens and The Bronx too.,nycpics,chyv2g9,5,t5_2tu3r
