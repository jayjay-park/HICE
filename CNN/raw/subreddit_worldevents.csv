That would protect Russian influence over that region and by extension over Kiev... gt The idea of Ukraine ever joining NATO is banished for as long as the conflict remains on ice and Russia has managed to freeze similar conflicts in Moldova and Georgia for two decades and counting.gt that the government in Kiev continue to fund social services in Donetsk and Lugansk even if those regions would be left effectively outside the Ukrainian governments control... andgt Europe anxious to get its own economy restarted could be expected to start lowering sanctions against Russia at So Putin wants influence over the eastern bit of Ukraine Ukrainian nonmembership in Nato social services for two provinces and less sanctions.Two years ago Russia had all of this except the frozen conflict. After Putin overreached and triggered a backlash Russia got huge sanctions lost two thirds of Ukraine alienated the west and presumably had to spend money and blood to invade Crimea and eastern Ukraine.

Gender reassignment surgery doesnt treat the underlying psychological condition A man the size of Bruce Jenner insisting on showering in and changing in the ladys locker room at the gym threatens women and they have a right to feel threatened. The stuff the transgendered activists are forcing on people is on an entirely different level than the homosexual stuff. Many of the same whackjobs in academia who have been advancing the transgendered agenda have come out in favor of normalizing the transabled those who are born ablebodied but who wish to become disabled. They would like insurance to cover surgery to remove limbs and then they would like the rest of society to pay for assisting them for the rest of their lives.

9227941,0,t1_d8lhll7,Lets put this into context. By the time you guys in the US start with the usual jingoism rara usa thing russia has a similar thing. They get taught from that point on that they conquered fascism. Thats it. That the western powers helped but it was their fight. Stalingrad gets elevated and there are reasons why russia untill now celebrates hero cities who earned their names during the second word war. The national myth of the USA is that you went to space. That you went and  despite being young as shit actually were amongst the first people to set foot off planet. That is something to be proud off. Russia is different. Russias pride is not technological progress because despite having beat you in the space race with sputnik they dropped out. Russias moment of pride is its ability to resist. It still remembers how a single army of essentially steppe farmers beat back one of the best armys of the world at this point. It remembers the sacrifices made on the eastern front and has romanticised them with the same fervor america remembers the good old days oif the wild west. Russia worships resistance. Read the stories about resistance. About partisans. About simple ruissian people who did great things. THAT is what the russian myth is build on that is wht they have as their self identification. And you act like they can just..... step back? When an army of rice farmers and slant eyes broke american battle doctrine during the vietnam wars when it was clear that the bloated fat american army was impossible to win against guerilla troops. did you retreat? No you got the war crimes and weapons of mass detruction. When the japanese in one fell swoop destroyed your navy and then it turned out that they were hard hit did you turn back? Nope you got the atom bomb fuck international rules. When your short history is so full from the fake terror attacks in spanish war on cuba to the black sites in the middle east wars and yet you worship seeing yourself as a great nation..... when you literally have as a battle doctrine every time  you meet a force you can not meet on the field entirely the civillians get it.... And yet you see yourself as the good guys..... Imagine how it will turn out when you guys find an old superpower that has build their national pride on resistance. After all from their point they have seen that every single move of americas was just a ruse. No new nuclear weapons was a ruse top push NATO to their boarders. You can say a thousand times did they get that in writing? No? Then tough luck we got them on that...It is time to consider the strategy. Is it wise to threaten an enemy that is bigger then any other? That no matter what you do you cant destroy so completely that they wont be unable to hit you back? Look at the russian side as an enemy. An actual enemy. Because if you leave even one stinking russian alive they will close ranks. They will close ranks like their fathers before them and like their grandfathers before them. They will hunker down and wait. They will read of the stories where their fathers and grandfathers held Leningrad. Read of a city that was so important  millionm soldiers and  million civillians were sacrificed to hold it. What was it you bitched about in the american civil war? Roughly  of the population an estimated  men lost their lives in the line of duty.  Taken as a percentage of todays population the toll would have risen as high as  million souls.  million lives for one city. That was an ACCEPTABLE EXPENSE. Think of it this way The bitching and the moaning on americas side was great when you had   of their pre war population amongst the fallen. It disturbs their sense of superiority it destroys the idea that you were the good guys. Americans are not supposed to just die by the thousands right? According to various russian sources it lost somewhere between  and  million people. It had decimation rates of   of its conscripts killed. And it thrived on that. It became its proudest hour. It is part of the russian way of life to hunker down and weather the storm.   of its population would have been seen in any phase of russian histpory as a light conflict enjoyable soRussia may be shit at punching and may be inferior to america but america has never taken a hit. It is the boxer that allways boxes and blocks so perfectly that he never takes one. Currently the idea is America will most likely hit very furiously and kill many but it will hit. BUT it will be open for a second afterwards. THAT is when you go in. Russia knows it can survive anything the US throws even the worst holocaust will not kill it instantly. BUT it also knows that all it has to do is hit it back. Just once. Imagine the devestation a single nuke fired at silicon valley will do. The US exists since if we are generous  years. In the entire time it has not had to fight any mayor conflict due to the pacific and the atlantic protecting it. OOOh it had to fight on its own territory but   of its population.... laughable in the european way. America acts like it can tough anything out but in reality no one knows how tough america is. Because it never had to take anything that others would call a punch .  So the idea is russia the heavy class world champion ship boxer  with a speciality in taking punches will do exactly that. Knowing that wounds can be healed. It will save all its energy for one goal That revenge hit. I honestly dont know that this will happen. maybe america cooks up something fierce of a cyberweapon. Or some biological one. Hell even chemistry. But if you can count on anything ou can countr on the russians being able to survive. And to then go oh yea we hit you good better sign that peace deal njugga is hopeless. If the russians are so much as touched they will insist on having their revenge. And they have a nuclear stockpile to do it. You will not be able to find words to explain to a russian why nuking america after it  in this hypothetial situation so hit russia would be a bad thing.

Did you?gt We judge that Iraq continued its weapons of mass destruction WMD programs in defiance of UN resolutions and restrictionsDo you understand the notsosubtle difference between claiming they were continuing a development program or even being in possession of precursor agents and claiming they were in possession of actual weapons which is the narrative sold by the Bush administration?gt And then the next page claims that Iraq is trying to make Nuclear WeaponsIt definitely does not make that claim.  It claims that most agencies believe they were trying to reconstitute a dead enrichment program and it presents the evidence based on possible material procurement and activity at suspected nuclear sites.  This is a very different thing than claiming they had a functioning nuclear program.Read the entire document and something stands out the intelligence agencies never actually claim that Iraq has nuclear biological or chemical weapons though they suspected Iraq had continued or tried to continue their programs deliberately obfuscated attempts to find the truth about the programs and probably retained some stocks of nonweaponized chemical and biological agents.  The document never claims or presents any evidence to support a claim that Iraq was in direct possession of nuclearchemicalbiological weapons except in a few certain cases where the Iraqis actually admitted to it. The idea that the IC presented a smoking gun to the Bush administration is a fabrication of the Bush administration itself.Instead the document claims. Iraq rebuilt certain missile and biological weapons facilities . Iraq did not have nuclear weapons nor the fissile material to make them but still wanted to acquire themat some point. Iraq had probably retained stocks of CW agents in nonweaponized form. Iraqs ability to manufacture CW agents was limited. There was no real evidence that Iraq had been producing biological agents in their fixed facilities and informants had reported the existence of mobile production facilitiesMore quotes from the actual documentOn Iraqs nuclear ambitionsgt  If Baghdad acquires sufficient weaponsgrade fissile material from abroad it could make a nuclear weapon within several months to a year. Although we have seen only a few Iraqi attempts to acquire material from abroad those efforts do not seem to be part of a systematic effort to acquire foreign fissile materials from Russia and other sourcesgt ..gt Without fissile material from abroad Iraq probably would not be able to make a weapon until  to  owing to inexperience in building and operating centrifuge facilities to produce highly enriched uranium and challenges in procuring the necessary materials equipment and expertise. On nuclear ambitions the dissenting viewgt  The information we have on Iraqi nuclear personnel does not appear consistent with a coherent effort to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program. Many key scientists evidently have been assigned to critical positions in the nonnuclear defense sector casting doubt on their ability concurrently to perform nuclearweaponrelated researchOn the retention of nonweaponized stocks of chemical agentsgt Although we have little specific information on Iraqs CW stockpile Saddam probably has stocked at least  metric tons MT and possibly as much as  MT of CW agentsOn the production of new chemical agents emphasis minegt  Iraq almost certainly has a CW agent production capability embedded within its chemical industry which enables Baghdad to conceal chemical agents munitions precursors production equipment and sensitive program information. We have been unable to corroborate multiple redacted claims of large scale agent production but an array of redacted reporting reveals that Baghdad is covertly procuring the types and quantities of chemicals and equipment sufficient to allow limited CW agent production.  We have no credible information indicating that Iraq is researching nontraditional agents.On biological weapon storesgt The nature and amounts of Iraqs stored BW material remains unresolved by UNSCOM accountingOn fixed facility biological agent productiongt UNSCOM inspectors reported that the facility was one of two in the country capable of containing highly pathogenic biological organisms. UNSCOM rendered it useless in  ... Iraq probably has renovated the facility but we are unable to determine whether BW agent research or production has resumed.On mobile biological agent production remember this is the main claim that turned out to be wrong...or at least never verifiablegt Baghdad has transportable facilities for producing bacterial and toxin BW agents and may have other mobile units for researching and filling agent into munitions or containers,worldevents,dbfckxs,1,t5_2riv9
