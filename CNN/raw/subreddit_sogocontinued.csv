2991658,0,t1_co7i6lx,Very true! I feel bad for that reporter but as a fan myself I would not want to meet him right now. He seems like a completely different person under all this stress. I really hope his mood lifts after the oscars. I hope the tabloids lay off and he gets to do whatever the hell it is hes doing with S in peace. ,sogocontinued,co8303k,3,t5_35rm6

I was confused on what level of stardom these guys represent since usually the Brit pack refers to young up and coming actors but Ralph Fiennes kind of threw me off. ,sogocontinued,cr27fty,1,t5_35rm6
3919899,0,t1_cr32l1e,You must be high right now if you think Im stunting for Weinstein. However discounting his influence is a rookie mistake. Dont refuse to give the devil his due just because you want to make fetch happen. He managed to get Oscars for JLaw and Goop but he couldnt swing it for Cumby could he? ETA Oh Gosh! He won a Central Ohio Critics Award? Forgive my sarcasm then. Hes really hit the BIG TIME! Lol.Im not going to compare Cumby to Meryl Streep because Streep actually has the respect of her peers and not just Reddit and tumblr fangirls. I mean you apparently want to compare him to the greatest actors and actresses out there well except for Hiddleston. According to you Hiddleston cant hold a candle to Cumby. I mean really fangirl? Really?Theater and TV awards are small potatoes. Ben is hungry for Alist fame like his heroes Clooney and Pitt both of whom have Oscars actually. And they both had A list fame long before they hit forty. Bens a bit long in the tooth to get started in on leading man roles. And sorry to break it to all his Cumbitches but most people think he looks like a foot an alien or a lizard. His face does not a leading man makeand those leading roles are the Alist ones.Still not addressing his big leading man film the one that went over like a lead balloon? The elephant in the room in The Fifth Estate. Care to try to defend that one? Lol.ETA Cake didnt get picked up by a distributor so it did shit BO same as TIG would have done without the Weinstein company which was part of my point. Thats what kind of difference good PR makes in terms of BO receipts.,sogocontinued,cr33rz4,0,t5_35rm6
