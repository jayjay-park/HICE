A short tournament with all the travel and a different team too. Its not a defensive team like we have. Its a different style of hockey that he saw there. Its two games. It really means nothing to what he means to our team. Weve got all the faith in the world in him.Really I didnt even think about Halak losing confidence. Glad to see him back. Hopefully he got a few days rest and hopefully hes ready to go Wednesday night. ... Hes always bounced back. I dont know the numbers but Im sure you can look at it and see how hes responded to maybe getting pulled or letting in more than one goal which zero to one goal for him is pretty routine.

For a team in the Western Conference looking to win the Stanley Cup investing heavily in that kind of player may not make a lot of sense.

I hope the Avs knock them the hell out. I feel Avs fans are infinitely more classy than the average Hawk fan. I just cant take another year of Hawks fans talking about how phenomenal they are. And the Avs have been on a similar rebuild schedule to the Blues maybe a year or two behind us. We know the sting of having a rough team for a few years but then seeing the fruition of home grown talent come. The division should be really interesting with both our teams trending upward.PS... we really need a cup soon. Really really need it.

I remmeber a headshot to a young Vladimir Tarensenko where his eyes rolled into his head and he missed a huge chunk of the season. Who was the team that caused it... the Avalanche. So they will get three days of sympathy from rhockey and then it will move onto someone elses cheapshot. Just remember this though next time you want to jump on a cheap shot bandwagon over there. There might be a history a  minute picture we didnt see. It might not justify the hit but it might put it into context. Lets try to be ambassadors of the sport and not jump in with everyone else,stlouisblues,cgl89tq,7,t5_2rlvj
713691,0,t1_cgkyyfd,yeah ive noticed this myself with the lack of offensive creativity. except for Steen Oshie Schwartz and Tarasenko none of our forwards have any true goal scoring instinct. when they dont get on the board they basically end up panicking and start doing that shot from the point and hope for a deflection or a rebound.  I really wish they would completely ditch that offensive style every team in the league is ready for it and its really easy to deal with just pressure the puck carrier near the line while your D boxes them out of the slot you know the area where over  of  goals are scored from.  the lack of hockey sense from our forwards is what is really holding this team back. ,stlouisblues,cglef1d,2,t5_2rlvj

736097,0,t3_22krdj,On one hand I say yes lets not be too hard on Miller. Hes been in the same Buffalo system for what  to  years? You see this with a lot of players they take time to adjust. Youd think that going from one of the worst teams in the league to the best would automatically make him just a tad bit better but I think most people would be surprised to know that is not the case. I think its something only hockey players can understand I say this never playing the sport.Side note I also think clearing up a bit of a misconception can help to understand these I guess you could say struggles. The thing with Buffalo is that their defense isnt exactly bad its just that the puck is in their zone all the time which is how most teams score on them most of the time whereas here in St. Louis hes not seeing the puck in his zone a whole lot.However I am beginning to think maybe were being a little too soft on him. If you ask me hes been letting in some soft goals here and there. Now you could say well the defense shouldnt even be having to put him in that situation. Thats all well and good but when you have a defensive collapse goalies just have to be ready.,stlouisblues,cgny4zx,5,t5_2rlvj

However in the case of game  it came from Chicago with the hit to the head of Backes and the knee on knee. Also alligator the shit Keith was doing and didnt get called on. Really dont blame him. The officiating has been shit for both sides. Only argument you might be able to make is the times calls have been made it was at a good time for Chicago.

Bergie is having his best season in a long time as well.This is honestly the best team we have had in a long time. Are they the team that will win the cup?Maybe maybe not no matter how good your team is you can always lose in the playoffs.Even if we dont win this season or next Im still going to be excited for our future. I believe our franchise will be at its peak when guys like Tarasenko Schwartz Shatty Pietrangelo and Lehtera are the veteran leaders and we have guys like Rattie Fabbri JAskin and Barbashev as the young studs on the team. We are going to be crazy good if we can keep those pieces with the franchise and we have Allen in net.

3762467,0,t3_33ggtb,Via JR info on Bortuzzogt Re Bortuzzo There is reason to believe he is still dealing with an injury and even if the Blues wanted to play him thats keeping him out.gt Bortuzzo suffered upperbody vs. Chicago on April  and missed  games. He returned for season finale played  but hasnt played since.gt Bortuzzo has practiced every day with the stlblues. But off the ice he requires a heavy treatment pack around the area of the injury.gt So in conclusion nothing has been confirmed. Bortuzzo may be out because Blues are electing that. But I wouldnt rule out injury possibility. ,stlouisblues,cql5dzx,10,t5_2rlvj

3808239,0,t1_cqq7n1g,I dont mean to just focus on systems. Thats just meant to be an example of my crotchety point about the general sentiment and post quality in the sub. If I make a thread for a player discussion on Patrick Berglund what do you think well get at the top? Ra ra Berglund sucks. Trade him for pokemon cards. Maybe someone will copypaste a stat line. The cool posts that I like are the ones that focus on the why. Some of the better posters around here are uassfortress and uthallis. Theyre inflammatory as hell and I sometimes disagree with them but they come out with informed opinions and if you respond they will probably back them up.Those are cool prompts youve written and obviously you are one of the cooler and older regulars around here. I dont want to be hockey analysis thread guy. Ive seen people try that and it never gains much tractiondiscussion. It comes out as more of a speakfromasoapbox thing. If I do that Id rather try to ask one of the Blues coverage sites to have me on as a contributor write a few articles and then maybe post them here to generate discussion rather than writing a Heres the thread for X. At least that way youve got an outside thing which people can reference and link back to later Instead of it dying after  hours.

Oshie being gone forces a shakeup of the first line anyway which gives us an excuse to pull Backes off the line.And Im not saying Backes is bad. Just that Ive never been convinced that hes a good fit for first line center. If you look at Backes and Stastnys career stats its pretty clear theyre different sorts of playersThey entered the league the same year and have very similar stats in a number of ways but where theyre different is telling. Stastny has considerably more assists and is better in the faceoff circle. Backes has a massively higher hit count and spends much more time in the penalty box.

Its something I havent seen since before Hitch was hired. You look at all of the talent that this team has and you just cant help but think about how they shouldnt be looking this bad. I know they are nd place in the division and are were the third team to hit  points but like I said something just doesnt seem right. They go out there with all of that talent and greatly under perform. I wonder if Oshies Information overload statement has some real weight to it. Now I know what dallas fans were talking about in regards to hitch and how our players would be  percent.

7147591,0,t1_d1qbqnl,The MAIN reason?? Man thats some bullshit. If Yeo is somehow this wunderkind coaching wizard or something how come hes out of a job right now? How come he got swept by Chicago immediately after our series? This has been happening for too long and its ridiculous. People have made up their minds in St Louis sports regardless of the team that if things start to stumble that its the coaches fault and he ought to be fired because he clearly lost the room. Go back and read post dispatch articles about La Russa before he won a World Series here it was the same malarkey. Its the laziest leastinformed opinion ever and Im tired of it. It requires literally no indepth thinking and sidesteps any real analysis. Its a way of saying they were better than we were but you get to have someones neck at the same time. Because I garuntee you . of posters have no idea what hockey coaching even looks like and most of them try to hide the fact by saying oh but Ive been watching for  years!!!! But that doesnt mean anything if the furthest depth youve ever watched the game leads you to conclude after  years of evidence that the coach is to blame for everything. Nobody here would recognize a left wing lock if it was frozen on the screen for a half hour. People just dont understand hockey so why they think theyre qualified to evaluate microadjustments in game plans or the execution thereof is just infuriating to me. Nails on a freaking chalkboard.,stlouisblues,d1qlved,2,t5_2rlvj

7166244,0,t1_d1sppkp,No no no sorry! you totally misunderstood haha. I can see the misunderstanding I said garbage goal... I meant it as a in the trenches hard working dirty goal. A great goal that really shows his hard work. NOT as a shitty goal I should have explained it better.That was actually my argument for him maybe playing better he is working hard and getting to the dirty areas. I also totally agree that he adds valuable depth and Id rather see him in over Rattie but Im not on the Rattie train. I was simply saying that IF Ott is out for the playoffs I would much rather see Reavo or Jaskins in that th line roll then PRV. It seems that most of the time he has the puck nothing happens. I mean hes got  points on the year through  games. He doesnt ever really get anything done out there on the ice. ,stlouisblues,d1sqfai,2,t5_2rlvj

7644263,0,t1_d3anfpy,Honestly I know Eddies had a rough playoff and I know Gunnys looked good compared to his old self but I think we should sit Gunny.He plays reasonably well in either zone. He even pinches. He plays pretty well especially with someone like Parayko to mask his shortcomings because hes always making the conservative play. He doesnt make mistakes like Eddie does.But we need possession right now and Edmundson provides that over Gunny. Gunnys possession is just terrible and right now hes the weak link thats letting our team be terrible in that department. Theres a graphic up on rhockey showing defenders impacts on carryins vs dump ins for both teams and its just atrocious for Gunny. Like he breaks up a play coming at him less than  of the time. He just lets them blow by him and tries to keep everyone to the outside. Thats nice in theory but it leads to extended Sharks zone time which is quite a huge roadblock for us since were not a great breakout team.I think that with some tutoring and a bit of trust Eddie could find his nice safe game again and continue being a positive impact on possession. Id use for DpairingsParaykoPietrangelo their possession together in the regular season was insaneEddieShattyBouwBortIf not then either switch Bouw and Eddie to shelter him a bit or maybe keep the traditional BouwPietro and go Parayko nd pairing on the left and Eddie third pairing on the left.I really I think we looked so much like crap because we played our D in a sub optimal way for possession and we tried to play prevent defense. ,stlouisblues,d3b40wz,1,t5_2rlvj

8142998,0,t1_d4vetqm,An overpay is still an overpay. m is a lot of money for less than  points a season. And Berglunds contract counts for this year regardless of when it expires.

8144732,0,t1_d4vl9zg,Yeah I think if we go into the season as is with Shatty aka decide to try to wait until trade deadline or worse yet get shafted like EDM did on Hall.  Then its a significant step back.  I know BackesBrouwer were on the decline but both ate tough minutes played physical and were the only ones who would go in front of the net.  The only player we have that could do that now and not get murdered is Bergy and he pretty much flat out doesnt.  I could see us try to get Steen andor Stastny do it and they would probably get injured in our division.Elliott Ive come to terms with but if Allen falters or gets injured for a decent amount of time we are probably out of the playoffs.  That being said I think resigning him today was one of the best moves of the offseason as if he stepped up and played really well we were probably looking at  mil.Ill also say it now be prepared for next year being similar except we may be able to get a big name because we will have cap space.  Schwartz is probably going to replace Steens contract Parayko is going to get paid.  Upshall and Bortz will be gone and Bergy andor Steen will be gone ,stlouisblues,d4vmynx,5,t5_2rlvj

I probably shouldnt be salty about it but it just left a negative impression on me.Fast forward a month later we go to the Mills for a practice. Got lots of signatures Oshie Brewer etc. the players were friendly and even let us take pics with them. I havent been to a Cards game since but we will support our Blues.

8914269,0,t1_d7hppok,I had NHL.TV last season after my HockeyStreams.com membership ran out because they stopped taking new members and stopped letting people renew.  NHL.TV was garbage unless it was the free game of the week and then it wasnt so bad.  I had to use a VPN but that wasnt the reason it was garbage.  I tried to watch out of market games not using it and had the same issues again unless it was the free game of the week.  Sometimes I would just get a blank screen the game was about  minutes delayed at times or  minutes if I was lucky and the video would stutter.  They would show the line changes at the bottom of the page so the same webpage was playing video and constantly changing to show the line changes and stats.  So Im not sure if thats why I was having issues or not but I really think it came down to the servers.  Thats why the free game of the week seemed to play fine but others didnt.  I was forced to go back to rNHLstreams and found rnhlgames.  I used them and the program on rnhlgames is what NHL.TV needs to be.  Id gladly pay for it if it worked just as good as it does but sadly others are doing a better job of getting NHL.TV to work than the ones being paid to.,stlouisblues,d7jd4qv,1,t5_2rlvj

I think he can make a difference if he wants to the last game he played was better. He threw his body around and used his speed wisely but he needs to adapt to the way the Blues play. Sometimes watching is better than playing now he just needs to learn. And maybe get rid of the white stick.,stlouisblues,dakpb06,9,t5_2rlvj

10055009,0,t1_dbgtdzz,I went to the game Monday and it was the first time I got to see him in person.  I have to say he looks better on TV than he does in person.  In person you see how many times he is out in the middle of nowhere and passes with no vision andor chemistry with his linemates.  He did have a few good plays and his defensive play has improved.  Several times he was out in the middle of nowhere on offense but quickly jumped into the defensemen who pinched ins spot.  If he was where he was supposed to be the defensemen probably doesnt need to try to pinch in but given his rep for bad defense he actually was fairly decent.  That said he is probably still on par with Tarasenko defensively which is to say when he cares about it he is sufficient but mainly just eating up space on the ice to try to limit the guys movesoptions rather than trying to steal the puck or stop the play.  However other times you see both just skating around in the zone not really covering prime real estate or a person waiting for it to leave the zone.  The problem is he doesnt produce like Tarasenko who you can give a bit of a passagain Tarasenko has improved a lot and occasionally has made really good defensive plays.  I think as others said the big difference is Tarasenko has put the team first and let his points come to him where Yak puts himself first and fights the system to put up his own points.Funnily enough its a big part of what shipped Perron out and he is now heads and shoulders a better team and defensive player than he was when he was with the team before.,stlouisblues,dbi6xfp,1,t5_2rlvj

10127540,0,t1_dbrlah6,The puck isnt the grenade on his stick that it was last season he has definitely improved there.  Not sure Id use PMD to describe him though.Defensively?  I think he has regressed compared to where he was midway through last season.  His play trended downwards towards the end of last season and into the playoffs.  Thats understandable.  His overall play this season reminds me more of the end of last season than the middle.Maybe my eye test is being overly harsh on him though.  It might be our overall defensive game plan and loss of Shaw that is impacting that.  I do think he has looked better since Hitch shook things up recently.,stlouisblues,dbrmhlp,1,t5_2rlvj

10504656,0,t1_dcyqpg3,Youre getting destroyed here but you have a point. How many teams have won the cup in the last  years without a legit  center? Zero. It is necessary in todays game. The Blues dont have one and that is a problem. It has been a problem. Theyre not easy to come by and yeah I think in order to get one we would need to give up one of Parayko or Fabbri. Thats just so tough to do because they are the teams best young players. Just having a true  center will not do much if nobody else outside of the top line is good. Its unfortunate for Doug Armstrong that Stastny did not work out the way he was believed to when he was signed. Also when Lehtera was extended he had been playing magically with Tarasenko looking like a legit  center. So Armstrong thought he had his  and  in those two guys but it turns out he has a  and a borderline  center between them. Teams are built from the middle the back end and the goalie. Two of the three need to be strong to quite strong. Right now the Blues are weak in all three areas and its not going to be an easy fix.,stlouisblues,dcytbu0,4,t5_2rlvj

I think your assessment is spot on.To answer your question about writers there are two guys that I follow on TwitterRobb  robbtuftshockeyAlex  gableingaroundRobb is also a writer for St. Louis Game Time. Neither do a ton of write ups but do tweet about the Blues from an analytical perspective. The criticism Shattenkirk gets is the same that a lot of offensive dmen get. I think that comes from looking at someones play in different zones individually but weighting defensive play more when judging how good they are. I think its better to look at it as the relationship between OFF and DEF play which xGF and GF does. If a guy is great defensively but doesnt drive play in the offensive zone you end up kind of breaking even. If a guy is just average defensively but puts up great offensive stats you end up with a net positive not meaning  wise but in overall play.Theres a stigma that offensive dmen get stuck with thats usually not fair.,stlouisblues,dd9vghe,2,t5_2rlvj

If there are eight teams that legitimately want him but three of them cant make a move without blowing up their cap space or losing a player that they need two do not have the pieces necessary to acquire him two he cant come to terms with and one that is happy to wait until the offseason and sign him as UFA... then what?,stlouisblues,deag6u1,2,t5_2rlvj

I said it in that thread too but if we didnt resign him you are looking at Zidlicky Markov Robidas for his replacement as top UFAs.  Top that off with he actually had a career year the year after we signed him.  He didnt really drop off until his injury and he has never fully recovered.  If you want to look in division look at Seabrook.  Very similar dealmil more a year and he is declining just as badlyif not worse.

Particularly during the stretch of    starts around the birth of his child Ill agree. He was bad more inconsistent than poor but the result was the same. I just think the  or  games before that and the skid leading to hitchs firing were caused by some poorly timed defensive mistakes or penalties.I mostly just had an issue with people who used that sample and ignored the rest of his career to suggest he was a bad goalie.
