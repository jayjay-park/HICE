Im using Smolov for bench and my squat and deadlift sessions are based off of Prilepins table. Im squatting twice a week pulling once and now that Im in the intense mesocycle for Smolov benching three times a week. The accumulation block was the base mesocycle of Smolov for bench and a rotation of lightmediumheavy unwrapped squatting and heavy wrapped squatting with deficit deadlifts and block pulls. This was about four weeks long with a deload week before the intense block.The intense block has included more wrapped squatting and heavier unwrapped work. Deadlifts are from the floor now and follow a linear percentagebased progression scheme. Every day that isnt bench is just a template. I have a weight I need to work with and a certain number of bar lifts to complete. Repssets are up to how I feel that day and I have a range I can work with.gt How long have you been using this training methodology and how does it compare to previous training methods youve usedThis is the first time Ive used Smolov in any fashion and my bench is responding well. Squatting more often in wraps for the intense block has helped my bench considerably. Ive done block periodization before and I love it. I keep things simple and just work hard.gt Is it a well known template you are following have you modified it in any way and why if soBlock periodization is incredibly popular in powerlifting.

654464,0,t1_cgekr53,First I just want to make sure you are breathing correctly. Its hard to tell but it seems you are breathing in through the gut rather than the diaphragm. The idea is to have your entire core just just the abdominals tight. A good indicator for seeing if you are breathing incorrectly is to see if your belly comes out or if your chest rises. If only your belly comes out you are breathing incorrectly. If your chest rises with the last two thirds of your breath you are breathing correctly. This is what I mean. In terms of depth can be used to test your low bar form this diagram shows what you should look for. Both your front squat and low bar seem to be a bit above parallel. As for your leaning issue try experimenting with the clean grip Finally I dont know if its just your body structure or not but I would be wary of your lower back exaggeration on the bottom of the squat. You seem to be over arching and you could develop an anterior pelvic tilt. I hope I helped.Edit Rephrased the breathing technique.,weightroom,cgenutv,1,t5_2ssmu

936015,0,t1_cha7r5d,gtThis may be way too nerdy for this venueMaybe but Im loving it.gtthe large genetic and epigenetic variation in a given population means that the contribution of any single variable is going to be masked by the noise inherent in the systemPossibly an insurmountable challenge and I wont be the one arrogant or foolish enough to think well overcome this any time soon. But Im not so sure that no single or several master variables can be unearthed. As someone working in  ecological sciences more specifically forest soil science  I can completely appreciate these challenges. But the noise can be accounted for with the right tests based on sound existing theory.gt  Unfortunately theyre almost completely uncoupled from mechanistic explanations which many people find unsatisfying. But really a direct linkage between moleculargenetic components and physiological performance is kind of the holy grail of biology and its super hard to do.The problem is its hard to know where to start in some cases and just randomly trying different approaches based on weak hypotheses is not feasible. Money solves a lot of these problems. Given the amount used to pay for athletes etc in a variety of sports most of whom benefit to some extent from strength training its surprising that more money hasnt been put into this type of research. Or maybe it has and the problems are really just that bloody hard. Still I dont think that genetics are really all that unique. Theres probably a handful of genetic factors that play the largest roles in controlling muscle growth postpuberty at least and neuromuscluar connectivity that are activated with the right stimuli. If we can identify those and determine how they affect muscle growth conditioning and neuromuscular connectivity mechanistically we could maximise activation of those genes through training.If only...,weightroom,chaohte,3,t5_2ssmu

Dont take a hike with the bar very slowly take one small step back with each foot just enough to clear the supports while focusing on keeping your chest and elbows up and back tight.  Make sure your feet are a comfortable width apart just a tiny bit wider than your natural athletic stance.Start the movement by pushing your hips back and pushing on the floor with the outside half of your heels.  Focusing on your heels will help your knees track properly and get the proper depth.  Youre not going quite deep enough.  This is what a lowbar squat looks like.  This is what a highbar squat looks like.Dont divebomb down.  Everything should be slow and controlled until you get to the very bottom.

Ive been part of the antiCrossFit circlejerk for long enough I figure I should try it before I hate on it too hard. I figure worst case I learn the Olympic lifts and get in better shape. Fun fact my gym box? is home to Cole Sager who took th in the Games this last weekend. The coaches here are all great and one even runs a strictly Olympic lifting class so I got pretty lucky with where I ended up.gt What does your training typically look like when pursuing these goals? Describe your history if applicable and what youre currently doing.History Selftaught powerlifter for four years. Lackluster numbers for that amount of time  squat bench deadlift. So far I havent lost much if any strength my PRs are all well within reach and actually set an OHP PR yesterday . Right now most of my effort is going into building skill work and mobility. Ill do the class if there is skill work I want a coach for or just lift on my own if the class doesnt seem like its going to be too valuable. Im currently trying to figure out how I should program for this when I leave. Ill probably talk with Cole when he returns from the Games about how to approach programming.gt Is there something that doesnt work at all when training with this goal in mind? Be it a certain lift programming etc.For me its attacking weak points. In powerlifting even if you tack on a few other exercises as primary exercises you have a very limited group of movements that will be tested in competition. In response Ill usually dedicate my time after my program to doing accessory work to fix weak points in those movements.There are SO MANY movements in CrossFit that can come up in a WOD or competition that its absolutely absurd to try attacking even half your weak points at once. Its a bit humbling to be unable to do the movements as prescribed heavy CampJ or Snatch muscle ups pistols mostly. Im struggling a lot with not going overboard and trying to be good at everything. Eventually Ill need to get there but damn. Its rough.gt How do you convince people that Crossfit doesnt suck?It kind of depends on which CrossFit youre talking about. CrossFit workouts in a box that the class does? Eh not going to defend that an awful lot. It may not suck but for anyone serious about progression it usually wont cut it unless you have a GREAT box.The CrossFit competition however? I justify it to myself that its the professional division of lightweight strongman with some otherdifferent skill work involved. There are some aspects of competitionskill that kind of confuse me handstand walking seriously? but I think its a solid competition that can test overall athleticism skill endurance and strength.

1587942,0,t3_2cgnli,the claim that starting strength is suboptimal may or may not be true but its pretty irrelevant. for lifters with a training age of a year or less i.e. pretty much all lifters on SS obsessing over an optimal program generally is a waste of time. SS may not be special or perfect but it gives the novice lifter a taste of consistent progress and most of the necessary tools to figure out how to transition into an intermediate program in the long term and intensity and consistency tend to be more impactful on beginners progress than optimal programming.in regards to the the program laid out here for a beginning lifter its too heavy on accessory movements and variations of the meatandpotatoes lifts and too light on the basic lifts themselves. For intermediate and advanced lifters there is a lively debate over how many accessory lifts should be incorporated and how often competition lifts should be performed in different variations but I dont think theres much debate among strength coaches that beginners should build up a base of strength with the big  before worrying about their close grip bench or pause squat or skullcrushers or whatever else.,weightroom,cjfbxty,23,t5_2ssmu

He might be better off using variations that will be less taxinginjury prone but will still allow him to improve his strength and muscularity.Something like a bench with a reactive sling shot could be a good example. Obviously he needs to get his form down first but something like this could be implemented in the future once he has a basic level of strengthtechnique.

1994831,0,t1_cktexbx,Dude sweet gym. It definitely looks like your hips are shooting up faster than they should. I think the issue is twofold your scapula are too far forward of the bar try to have them right over or just behind the bar and your spinal erectors may be weak. Try to position yourself in a way so that if you were ready to lift and you let go of the bar youd fall backwards. This will also lead to you using more quads thus lifting heavier weight not to say using more quads than hams just more quads WITH the hams this isnt a RDL afterall. Also really flex your lats to bring your scapula down and locked this will help to bring the weight closer to your center of gravity. As for your erectors you can always do some work with good mornings or RDL to beef them up. ,weightroom,cktksz4,2,t5_2ssmu

So  sets of that and perhaps  sets of bodyweight pullups. As another caveat Ill also go ahead and state that Id throw in some restpause sets on the last sets of some of the hypertrophy exercises for lack of a better term and Id also do some drop sets every so often. ampnbspDay  Deadlifts Power  Id do Deadlifts and some variation of the lift. If I was training myself Id do probably  sets in total.  ampnbspDay  Overhead Press Power  Id do some heavy Overhead Presses followed by some heavy Weighted Pullups.  ampnbspDay  Back  Biceps  . Lat Pulldowns or some vertical pulling for  sets of  reps  . Dumbbell Rows  sets of  reps  . Seated Rows  sets of  reps  . Shrugs amp Upright Rows superset for  sets of  reps with emphasis on the hold at the top of each rep  . Bicep superset two bicep exercises for  sets of  reps  ampnbspDay  Legs  . Back  Front  Box Squats for  sets of  reps  . Unilateral Leg Exercise like Reverse Lunges or Stepups or Split Squats for  sets of  reps  . One Posterior Chain Exercise from Cable Pullthroughs Supine GHRs Swings etc for  sets of  reps  . Calves two exercises for  sets of  reps with the pauses and the holds to get that pump going  ampnbspDay  Chest  Triceps  . Dips  sets of high reps  . Low Incline DB Press  sets of  reps  .

2938812,0,t3_2tt1dh,I think youve got a lot of great options here already as far as exercises that will help you build muscle and get stronger so Im not going to comment on that element. But here are what I consider the three most important elements to basic program design Throughout the course of a week try to include a squat andor deadlift exercise a rowing exercise and a pressing exercise. Overall volume using is probably the most important factor for hypertrophy. A setrep scheme like x is great but if youre unable to get stronger and build muscle with a combination of proper form a diet with sufficient protein and a caloric surplus add more volume x x xwho knows its your body and it will react to training volume as only your body does. Frequency builds strength. When you perform an exercise more often you will get better stronger at it and will be able to program that exercise with more volume consequently building more muscle by putting more weight on the bar instead of adding sets and reps.,weightroom,co25mib,2,t5_2ssmu
2938838,0,t1_co23x57,Which beginner program wereare you on? The thing about SL SS Texas Method Ice Cream Greyskull is they all have a prescription for when you dont hit the desired rep range. It isnt restart they start to toy with exercise selection and set X rep schemes. SS eventually has you drop one day of squats for  of the previous session. SL has you reduce volume to x. Greyskull LP has you deload and work back up with the last set to failure. Youre also not supposed to be on a beginner program forever. The x programs generally do a good job of teaching someone to push themselves the volume intensity relationship and when to add accessories. The problem everyone just skims the SS wiki and jumps right in. Then wonders why they are slamming into a wall so soon. No problem with jumping right in but no one ever seems to follow the actual programs as they are laid out.Im sorry this turned into a rant and is all in a response to you.

3008376,0,t1_co9pj5f,Having read the wall squat article before I see no reason why the forms are exclusive. The wall squat article focuses primarily on excess knee travel which goes in line with Rippetoes article here. While he does mention forward leaning he specifically states its during the concentric portion of the lift meaning he has his lifters wall squat to prevent doing a good morning mid squat again like Rippetoe writes here. I dont read a whole lot of Sheikos articles so perhaps he has one describing why he prefers a more vertical chest if he even does? I read the wall squat article as an extreme training tool to get part of the groove correct while not actually being the form he wants the lifter in at the end much like the very criticized hip hinge video Rippetoe has. ,weightroom,co9tdji,2,t5_2ssmu

3043828,0,t1_cod01x2,I think there are two things at work here Front squats are very similar to back squats in terms of how they stress the lower body but they have more potential limiting factors abs and upper back come to mind. Therefore its possible that the  back squat requires the lower body to produce more force than the  front squat. I have no idea if this is actually true but it seems plausible. As a general trend at least with free weights I think that movements that use more weight tend to be more stressful. I dont know if that necessarily applies to front squats vs back squats in a significant way but I would definitely say that a  deadlift is likely more stressful than an  press which is more stressful than a  curl.,weightroom,codhq23,5,t5_2ssmu

3156121,0,t3_2watdd,I had a question about the final sectionThe front squat will help build great thoracic extensor strength increasing the weight you can lift in the back squat before back strength limits you this also gives it great carryover to deadlift strength.  The high bar squat is the most wellrounded of the three allowing heavier loading than the front squat because back strength is somewhat less of a limiter while also permitting a longer ROM than the low bar squat. Why does the ability to work with a heavier load make it a better exercise than the front squat? It seems to me that a powerlifter would want to move the maximum weight possible and would therefore squat lowbar and for anyone else front squat would be optimal as it leads to the greatest back strength. I cant see how highbar is the best choice.Sorry If I am misunderstanding something,weightroom,cop4ofw,6,t5_2ssmu

I wanted to force the readers to think through it for themselves and wrestle with some of the concepts.  I was afraid that if I gave too many examples people would take it to mean THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT rather than this is one possible way this principle could be applied.Even in the second edition my preference would be to make all of that an appendix at the end of the book so people who are curious about how it would look in practice could flip to the end and see examples without it breaking up the conceptual material in the main text.,weightroom,cptdicy,15,t5_2ssmu

I recommend holding it there for sure.Also get chalk. If I dont chalk up I almost always see my hands in worse shape than when I do. Chalk before you need to. Even if you wont drop the bar the bar will still move slightly chalking up decreases that movement a lot.Also one more benefit of holding the bar lower in your palm is it actually increases leverage.

4158854,0,t1_crt6ka0,That depends. The amount of power you generate depends on the weight used and the leg drive you put into it. The exercise you do influences it but theres no guarantee that doing any particular variation will work better for you.The biggest problem and I suspect an issue for you based on your comment about your power and full versions of the lifts being similar is that its very easy to rely too much on your arms and not on your legs. The more you pull with your arms early on the less leg drive you will get. Its a hallmark of lifts that look slower and which are difficult to drop under. Its also a major pitfall of the power variations because ironically its easier to pull the bar higher with an armpull. Muscle versions would likely be even worse.In theory the blocks may be your best bet if youre trying to focus on the triple extension. Especially for an armpuller the amount of time you keep your feet in contact with the floor in the second pull strongly correlates with the maximum height the bar attains. If the bar has more momentum its easier to keep the second pull going just a little bit longer  bracing yourself against the floor after triple extension has mostly finished while pulling up with your arms. By eliminating the momentum you would otherwise have gained in the pull from the floor youre forced to produce your secondpull force in a shorter time period. Assuming you dont drop the proportional total force by as much or more as the change in time you would by definition be generating more power.The hang is a doubleedged sword. It can be similar to working from the blocks but commonly people use it as an opportunity to get a stretchreflex that bypasses the point of limiting initial momentum. Whether you still armpull from the hang just depends on how you approach it.There is value in spending time on technique. There are many components of technique that specifically improve your ability to give leg drive a higher priority. Some big ones are keeping the bar close to your body not starting the second pull too early and keeping the arms straight in the first pull.Last measurements of bar speeds in training and at international competitions have shown that more power tends to be generated in the snatch than the clean and max power output tends to peak at weights well below maximum maybe the  range depending on which lift.,weightroom,crubjef,14,t5_2ssmu

Think of a beginning trumpet player who has to breathe every ten seconds because of the air they waste trying to get the trumpet to make a sound.

4417654,0,t3_3bmy5f,Regardless of whether youre trying to cut or bulk you need to track your caloriesmacros in some way. Obviously myfitnesspal is the most common but whatever works for you. I think this is mostly overlooked while bulking because people feel like theyre eating enough but really arent. Ive fallen into the trap of feeling like Ive eaten a ton only to plug it in and realize I have something like g of fat g of carbs and g of protein to go for the day. Hit your mahcrohs.Another reason for this is so that you actually have something to work with when you decide to cut. If youve just been eating idk a lot and then you want to cut how much are you going to eat so that you lose an appropriate amount of weight? Unless you eat exactly the same thing every day and then remove one  calorie item it wont work like that.If you want to bulk add  calories to your current diet after tracking honestly for a couple of weeks your weight should climb reasonably and when it stops for a week add another .

4675336,0,t3_3ewlws,The linear program was the first program I did after Stronglifts and I have to say I really enjoyed my time on it.I wanted to move to a different program than Stronglifts because I was getting bored with it and didnt really like that everyone and their mother was running it. After a short search I found powerliftingtowins program review and from there I found canditos novice program.About the actual program I think its great. Its refreshingly different from other novice programs by being a  daysweek upperlower split. Through this split it allows for varying intensities in the week and a better focus on hypertrophy which I think is important for continued progress rather than just lifting as heavy as possible all the time. I also think its very appreciable how jonnie displays  different templates depending on where you want to focus your training and really only programs the squat bench and deadlift allowing you to pick any exercise you want for the other slots. I believe this variety is beneficial for a beginner because it allows them to find an exercise that they not only like doing but may also perform better at. For example I would stall bad on overhead presses but found that I could progress decently on dumbbell presses and I even felt them work my shoulder more.I would like to see this program recommended to the majority of people over stronglifts because jonnies program is I feel a more complete workout. It focuses on adding muscle alongside strength which is something novices would do good to get in their head so when they eventually stall they dont just deload and try the exact same thing.As a side note i think this recent post has an interesting discussion concerning just this Also I feel the actual pdf is much more succinct at only  pages only talking about the program and not giving you success stories and personal background and other garbage.The only cons I could possibly have with the program is that there are no amraps however thats a minor detail. And I just really like amraps and autoregulation.Ps. I personally find it very inspirational that jonnie is a manlet just like me  . and that he is a competitive powerlifter.,weightroom,ctjvk31,8,t5_2ssmu

5153675,0,t3_3lkyns,Based on the video I think you would benefit from lifting without the weightlifting shoes. See how you have your knees forward   lot but almost instantly the bar starts to drift backwards. With this said its not certain vertical shins is whats optimal for you but you can still push the knees forward without the raised heel if you need to.After this you need to reassess the situation. What you need to find out is where its best  for you to have the bar on the floor in relationship  to your body as well as at what hight you start with your hips. You can  do this by putting the bar over the mid foot while standing straight pull on the bar while getting everything tight push the knees forward so they meet the bar while still pulling on the bar then deadlift. Record your self and adjust if needed.  Personally my sweet spot is in line where my toes starts but this all depends on proportions and my hips get to the right position automatic if I set up correctly.   Do this while resting the bar on the floor between each rep. ,weightroom,cv77kqg,1,t5_2ssmu

So it doesnt matter.So momentum and kinetic energy wont matter? Pulling lb in x gravity would feel the same as pulling lb? The amount of work done doesnt change but the feeling of the movement would change drastically. Think doing squats with the bands assisting verse resisting.gtIt just means they can put smaller plates on the stack and you have to push harder to move it.Youve also got the whole thing the wrong way round. You have a mechanical advantage and as such the momentum of the weights is halved. Its a completely different feeling movement. It feels like youre pulling against weightbands but with the entire range of motion requiring the same force. Try it out if you can youll instantly feel a big difference.

What you are talking about though is Net work in a single vector. So if im measuring the work done on the bar in the upward direction starting from the standing position I end up at zero because I first went downward.The reality of the movement are that they should be looked at in pieces. The work done to slow the bars acceleration due to gravity on the descent in a squat then the work do to accelerate it upwards against gravity to the standing position. You are just taking a faulty position in considering the whole movement as a single act of displacement when it should be looked at in parts if you want anything meaningful to come out of the physicsmath.,weightroom,cwmubp8,-8,t5_2ssmu

My husband doesnt want me running at night and its too cold for my asthma to run on the roads. So Im at the gym now.Ive always sucked with strength. Particularly upper body. Proudest gym moment so far was  lbs on leg press. But my arms need some real help.Id also like to work on vascularity in my arms because I would love to replace my part time income by donating plasma twice a week. Get more time with my baby keep helping pay the bills and have more time for getting the fit body Ive wanted for years. My veins are so small though that Ive been turned away twice at the plasma center. Ive always had problems with IVs and donations and while I think part of that is going to be resolved by lowering body fat I think lifting weights will help make my veins easier to get the plasmapheresis needle in. Anyone have specific suggestions for that beyond curls hydration amp lowering BMI?Im new to the club. Nice to join you guys ,weightroom,cygpj7e,2,t5_2ssmu

I doubt a coach is going to seat you in a boat because of your steady state times. In this way its better to be a bit sore from lifting on steady state days.

The glycogen thing is interesting as a person whos done endurance activities and carboloading when eating isocaloric highcarb diets increasing from  to  over the duration of the study glycogen concentrations increased in men but not in women because the additional carbohydrate was immediately used as fuel instead of stored.An terms of training ...Finally as far as training goes though well get more into training as this series progresses odds are pretty good that you can do more work and benefit from more work than a guy can.  Your muscles are inherently more glycogensparing and fatigueresistant.  You can probably do more reps with a given percentage of your rm before fatigue sets in and do more total work relative to rm before you hit a wall due to higher proportion of Type  muscle fibers greater proportion of fat being burned instead of glycogen and lower glycolytic capacity.

I completely support the idea of a clean slow bulk but you have to understand that this still means you are increasing your weight over time. The difference here is that you are doing it in a slow and controlled manner. A goal of  lbs a month is a great place to start. If you think about it you would only be gaining  lbs over the course of an entire year which isnt that bad given your height. I would recommend increasing your daily calories by  then wait a week and see if your weight changed. If not add  more and wait another week. Also it doesnt really matter if your scale is accurate as long as your weight is moving in the right direction.As far as the reps go i think what you are doing is fine. However working out  times a week and running  times a week seems like overkill to me. Depending on the routine im doing i work out  times a week and i always squat bench and deadlift twice a week one light day and one heavy day.Lastly based on what you decide to change make sure you only do one at a time and see if it makes a positive difference.,weightroom,d0wexyd,2,t5_2ssmu

A normal week for me looks like this Sunday  Dead lift Monday   mile run Overhead press Tuesday  Squat Wednesday   miles of speed work Thursday  Bench Friday   miles Saturday   mile long runYour running plan looks OK to me but Id make a couple suggestions.  The form drills and your sprintsintervals are probably not necessary to begin with. They have value but are more commonly used among runners with more mileage. I might suggest starting with making a Wednesday or Thursday run at your goal pace instead of jumping straight into sprints or intervals. Speed work is also taxing on your recovery. Your long run will have to get longer to reach your goal. Maxing at  miles is fine for your first half but youll do better if you eventually stretch that to   or beyond. I work up to a couple of  milers before a half with a midweek run of  miles as close to goal pace as I can.Seems like you have a good baseline of fitness so I dont think this applies to you but just in case... Dont start out at zero and try this at once. If you already run add in a couple days of lifting then build up to  or . If you already lift add a couple days of running and slowly increase your weekly mileage. Plan for some deload weeks both in running and lifting. It is possible to do both running and power lifting but starting out with everything all at once is a recipe for overtraining and injury.Youre wise to program in stretching and mobility work. Your foam roller will be your best friend during this. A hot bath or some light yoga can really help bring my legs back to life.Recovery is really important. If your sleep and your nutrition is off youll really feel it. Youre essentially doing double what most reasonably fit people do because youre trying to tackle both of these disciplines at once. Make sure youre prioritizing your recovery or youre going to end up in trouble.If theres anything I missed or anything else I can help with just let me know. I love finding other folks like me who are willing to push the limit and see what they can do.,weightroom,d246s2c,3,t5_2ssmu

Its not a huge squat but comparable to your goals. If there is only one thing it would be squat more often. How often will depend on the rest of your training goals im a weightlifter which allows me to focus on squatting alot. If your doing  day a week now do . If your doing two add front squatting. If your doing  do . For me its a heavy single every day in either BS or FS. I hit a daily minimum which is around  of my RM and increase this by kgs every  weeks or so. When im tired ill do something like a beltless paused FS which limits the loading whilst still being hard. For accessory work do lots of hamstring curls. Saying that the programming really doesnt matter at the weights your using. Just squat more frequently then you currently are and set up for every squat the same no matter the weight. ,weightroom,d2tw0tr,4,t5_2ssmu
7497618,0,t1_d2sewa6,Ive been doing TB and  for close to two years now. My occupation in the military is very unforgiving when it comes to certain programs like Texas or SS used both. Unsustainable for me. I have to ruck run and swim all the time. LOTS of daytoday cardio. Other programs  Easy Strength were much more compatible and easy to use but provided little in the way of actual results or increases in RM strength. Pavels kettlebell programs benefited me immensely in terms of GPP and some strengthendurance but I found KBs to be an incomplete solution by themselves when it came to developing maximalstrength and cardiovascular conditioning.  My experience with Crossfit was that it was excellent when it came to GPP but very onedimensional and pretty much neglected proper strength work and aerobic training completely. Me and a couple other guys in my unit found that after a steady diet of just Crossfit our middlelong distance run times and rms dropped significantly. Crossfit shines when it comes to general work capacity and anaerobic training in my opinion but thats about it. All the jacked CFers you see at the games are doing supplemental strength work on the side no doubt about it.  I love the TB strength program and it works like a charm but the real magic is in the conditioning book which not only teaches you how to train your energy systems but also how to combine everything max strength muscularendurance aerobicanaerobic training for those that need to be good at everything. Since using TB my abilities in all of these areas are steadily improving to the point where Im the fittest Ive been measured in PFT scores and  rep maximums in the gym. Turned into bit of a novel but hope this helps. Keep in mind you should choose a program based on your goals. If youre just interested in specializing in lifting for example then your program needs to reflect that. TB isnt going to be the best choice for everyone.   ,weightroom,d2ufv0z,1,t5_2ssmu
7500912,0,t1_d2ucvam,Yeah four days a week would be a good start. So do a heavy single then maybe take kgs off and do another single then another  off and one more single would be perfect. Squatting more often will make you leaner especially if you do it at the start of your session. My press is probably my better lift at kgs i was ecstatic the first time i pressed body weight. My tip would be always press after you squat and do more volume xs and xs at least x a week and id try for more. I dont do specific back work really because i olympic lift which is enough in itself but id definitely try do alot of pull ups and some rows. At the moment im trying to work up to  pull ups  days a week and my back already feels so much tighter when i squat. ,weightroom,d2utchz,3,t5_2ssmu

7568577,0,t3_4izwgh,Heres something Ive always wondered about squatting every day whats the advantage to squatting  times a week? At least your legs get one day of rest. And if squatting every day is the superior option why dont we emulate this approach for the other muscle groups as well?Edit I went looking for some research on RT frequency nonsquat specificStrength and conditioning research  Strengthgt For untrained individuals greater training frequency leading to more volume could lead to greater strength gains. However splitting the same weekly volume out over more sessions is unlikely to be beneficial. For trained individuals splitting the same weekly volume out over more sessions might be beneficial but evidence is very limited. Training with a higher frequency might be more effective for increasing strength because of improved intermuscular coordination by virtue of a greater number of practice occasions.Strength and conditioning research  Hypertrophygt For untrained individuals altering volumematched training frequency does not seem to have any effect on hypertrophy. For trained individuals a higher volumematched training frequency might to be superior to a lower volumematched frequency for hypertrophy.Effects of Resistance Training Frequency on Measures of Muscle Hypertrophy A Systematic Review and MetaAnalysis   Schoenfeld Krieger Ogborngt When comparing studies that investigated training muscle groups between  to  days per week on a volumeequated basis the current body of evidence indicates that frequencies of training twice a week promote superior hypertrophic outcomes to once a week. It can therefore be inferred that the major muscle groups should be trained at least twice a week to maximize muscle growth whether training a muscle group three times per week is superior to a twiceperweek protocol remains to be determined.Influence of Resistance Training Frequency on Muscular Adaptations in WellTrained Men gt Results showed significantly greater increases in forearm flexor muscle thickness for TOTAL compared to SPLIT. No significant differences were noted in maximal strength measures. The findings suggest a potentially superior hypertrophic benefit to higher weekly resistance training frequencies.,weightroom,d32idoi,34,t5_2ssmu

7973319,0,t1_d4ar3o7,Im going to assume this is true. Im also going to assume that youre not trying to front squat as much weight as possible for its own sake but to help other lifts build quads etc. So just how much mobility is needed? Lat length? You do need a lot of that if you are to achieve full shoulder flexion but the front rack doesnt require much shoulder flexion does it? Wrists? You just need three fingertips on the bar it really isnt that demanding. I think the real issue in most cases is that people try to cheat their front squats just like they do their back squats whenever the weight is too heavy or they attempt one too many repetition. You can see it happening in your video the weight is too heavy the quads and glutes cant produce enough torque so you cant stay upright you have to lean forwards more to get some length in the hamstrings so that they can help out a little. Im not saying its completely useless to do such reps but I would suggest stopping at a technical max as that means that the quads will have got all the stimulation they could cope with anyway.,weightroom,d4c9yly,0,t5_2ssmu

Realistically  is somewhere between power and hypertrophy but functionally it lets you go a bit heavier than  ranges while still adding a decent number of reps.  Its not the primary way you build power just reinforcing volume.For hypertrophy reinforcement those are mostly pump sets or highvolume core work towards the end of your session.  Its not the primary way one would generate hypertrophy  but its just some extra volume when  gets too heavy.tldr Its nothing magical.  Just extra volume at a lighter weight.

9513428,0,t1_d9loq8o,Yeah Ive gone over that above LE study. This review on LE is the best one to date.Long  What is the clinical effectiveness and costeffectivenessof conservative interventions for tendinopathy?An overview of systematic reviews of clinicaleffectiveness and systematic review ofeconomic evaluationsI wouldnt say do nothing short term conservative therapy does indeed help especially if pain is prohibiting work or activity. But there is a lack of intermediate  month and long term  month outcomes over just doing nothing. Basically exercise short term helps intermediate and long term nothing works. Which is really weird to be honest.I suspect the reason for this is a lot of LE is due to work related incidence and so if you potentially stop rehab or home exercises andor dont adjust how youre doing things it just comes back or goes away depending on what you did. But thats just speculation.gtThe biggest aspect is progressively loading the tendonous unit to hypertrophy the healthy surrounding tissue. The patgologic tissue doesnt really dissapear or realign. So thats why progressive loading is so helpful.From the research Ive done pathologically eccentrics seem to normal blood flow and eliminate ingrowth of blood vessels and nerves into the tendon. Paradoxically its increased blood flow to the pathological portions of the tendon and thus healing follows the pattern of normalization of the tendon structure hypertrophy decrease in swelling decrease in blood flow that seem to indicate healing. Unfortunately studies indicate that the ingrowth of nerves is not the cause of the pain so its probably something multifactorial that cant be identified yet. Im trying to get a book out on this review of the literature eventually but its a very very very long process. Gone through over  studies already and honestly the more research I do the more muddled and confusing it is. This is the best summary of pathological tendon and response to eccentrics so far that Ive read out of those massive amounts of studies if you were curious. It mainly goes over rotator cuff though.Ill check out Jill Cooks work.,weightroom,d9lqdzy,2,t5_2ssmu

9775763,0,t1_dagt8hh,Dont know if I am good at giving advice. I can try to tell you what worked for me for OHP I personally believe that my core is pretty weak but I can do pretty much body weight OHP for a rep.So for a long time I was also stuck around kg for OHP what I found worked was changing my form slightly. I would force my wrist to be straight instead of allowing it to bend. At first this made even kg too heavy and my forearm always ended up in a pump. Eventually my forearm became strong enough that it wasnt a problem and I easily added kg to my OHP. You see now that weight is heavier  I still try to prevent my wrist from bending because it increases the surface area of my palm touching the bar and allows me to push straight up. The weight is too heavy for me to keep my wrist completely straight but I am sure if I did not try to force it during the earlier weights I wont even be able to hold kg up.,weightroom,dai2uh7,2,t5_2ssmu

If the only thing a trainee only lifts and the only thing they do is change movements they arent meeting the intent at all.  Its about training ALL the aspects of athleticism.  They dont have to be trained all at once and I dont believe I expressed such sentiment they simply should be trained.I do find it interesting you equate sled dragging with wrapping yourself up with rubber bands.  When youre talking about training beginners are you speaking of beginner lifters or beginner athletes?  I definitely agree that a beginner lifters training focus should be on lifting mechanics but for a beginner athlete I wouldnt start them off with lifting at all.  Ive liked the Soviet approach of starting off with play first before moving on to lifting.  We saw this in the western style approach too it just went without saying everyone played a sport before.

This was an ugly fifth set but you can see that the last ish inches of these squats are just me relaxing and losing tension only to tense up again near parallel.Shortly after this I decided to work on a shallower depth and made good progress but developed some knee tendinitis which I think was a direct result of trying to change directions closer to parallel. ...like Thrall Im still experimenting with a depth that works for me.

It tells me that nearly any protocol would have worked for the population in question.  I feel like if these people really sucked at squatting enough to where that kind of increase was even possible in  weeks then the difference could be accounted for by more effective technique practice alone.  They may have improved simply because they got more first reps with less fatigue so their RM increased because the technique was ingrained better.  Would we see nearly as much of a difference in experienced lifters who have great technique to begin with?Not saying cluster training doesnt work just pointing out an observation...Edit also due to just how big the reported gains in power and strength were it makes me wonder what a longer term study say  weeks with   week training cycles would show in terms of effectiveness.  Would a longerterm study show cluster training to always have a superior outcome or would a mix of protocols turn out to be better because of novelty and accommodation considerations?  Would the gaps in results from both protocols end up getting closer and closer as the subjects completed more cycles?,weightroom,deh7o8b,13,t5_2ssmu

11066399,0,t3_5y06fg,Last year I ran hepburn for a few months pretty much as written in the book Hepburns Law. I had it set as an upper lower which in hindsight was a mistake because that had me doing two presses every day. At first it worked really well but the AMRAP s basically something like  or  sets taken near or to failure around the  rep mark followed by  rep pump sets for two pressing exercises every upper day got brutal. So I adjusted by shortening the progression to  week blocks and incorporated deloads which was not an adjustment I would make now in hindsight... more on that later.  This kept progress moving for another two months before I finally started seeing backward progress. As in I was actually losing reps each week. My shoulders started feeling a little tender and I was getting really beat up and tired in general regardless of sleep or diet. In hindsight  I would have organized the days to be full body so say benchsquat and ohpdead to spread the volume out more or focused on only one main pressing exercise on an upper lower scheme instead of both benching and pressing and made different adjustmentsnamely lighten and reduce the volume of the  rep sets. Taking a total of  sets basically to failure every day after hitting a bunch of doubles or triples is ridiculous and unsustainable. I put my failure squarely on my own shoulders for being an idiot and breaking myself. But what I realized too is that the program really didnt work for me psychologically.  I like keeping the weight on the bar moving.  And i like feeling like i really pushed myself. Keeping the weight the same week after week is demotivating and I think I had an ego driven need to kill myself on the volume work as a result.  When the book said something along the lines of a weight that you can hit for  but maybe only  or  on the last sets  I basically thought okay so die in a pool of vomit sweat and feces at the end. Got it. Thats not how you should run any program. I think thats why  works better for me. It stresses conservatism and you push hard every session but only one or two sets really matter. Everything else is just reps and volume. Tl dr if you do the program be smart about how you set it up and adjust things and dont do it exactly as written in the book. It can look good on paper but it can and will bury you if you run it like an idiot. ,weightroom,demd6ji,14,t5_2ssmu

11072230,0,t3_5y3dxf,One thing Id like to note Dave Tate says Bench press is a triceps exercise it is NOT about chest.Your pecs do have a large influence over your bench press but triceps are still quite possibly the larger contributor. In my experience pec deck is great for chest development as an accessory but it does not work your triceps nearly on the same level as benching would. Because of this I would not consider cable flies or pec deck to be a valuable alternative to barbell or dumbbell pressing.To address the more pertinent matter do you have access to parallel bars? Dips are a fantastic alternative to bench press assuming your shoulders and elbows are not bothered by them I often hear this is an issue of form.,weightroom,den0zbz,4,t5_2ssmu

11363991,0,t1_dfk2jcu,Location may vary based on your anatomy. Different people will wrap above or below the navel but always against the part of their belly that expands most when they inhale. Its not supposed to physically brace your lumbar its supposed to help you stiffen your abdomen AROUND your lumbar. I very personally have a loose disc at LS and not many inches of extra room around the belt so my belt looks low to some people.Not too tight. Taking a deep breath should expand your abdominal wall against your belt. You do not corset yourself into shape with a tight belt. That restricts deep breathing which is still critical even with the belt.Save the belt for high percentage reps or for long sets where fatigue could put your back at risk. I put a belt on above  minimum and loosen it between sets. Ill also go without it when Im feeling particularly limber and warm but I do find that takes about  off my top.,weightroom,dfk34uj,4,t5_2ssmu

Also has the added benefit of hitting your back x a week to some extent which your back can handle. Hence I like to keep it in leglower day.Usually youd alternate heavy deadliftslight squats and heavy squatslight deadlifts because like uSamsaraSage said it destroys you and your recovery to go heavy on both on the same day.If you want to become really good at deadlifts you should treat the light day as form practice for them so no to the trap bar if a big deadlift is a long term goal. Get as many reps as possible doing what youd be doing at heavier weight. If youre a little more casual of a lifter or more focused on hypertrophy go for whichever you prefer. ,weightroom,dfl6hv3,4,t5_2ssmu

There are some places where you could have the tendon standing out because it is more prominent or easier to see like the biceps tendon. But when were talking about the neck those are muscles sticking out. Just because of the way our anatomy is set up the origin and insertion points of our neck muscles arent nearly as prominent if it is even visible at all. ,weightroom,dfyamfx,6,t5_2ssmu

BB shurgs   sets of kg x.  suitcase BB holds  GHR situps SS   sets  Total training time  h min.  Three excercises today Ive never did before  power cleans BB shrugs suitcase BB holds.  Power cleans were fun but Ive learned Im pretty uncoordinated  I dont think I managed to do a single proper rep but by the end of it I started to get hang of it so next week should be fine. At the begginig I had problems humping the bar too early and I ended with bruised knees and scraped shins.  Shrugs felt really awkward at first but after that went pretty OK. Ive also learnt that my arms are too short and my butt too big to do them with barbell behind me.  Suitcase holds are a LOT harder than they look.

11629185,0,t3_65voaz,Fact is before I knew a damn thing about MPS volume and plateaus and periodization I made good progress because I was doing a surprising number of things right just by feel.  A lot of good things have happened because I formalized my programming and learned more about the principles behind training but now that I have the benefit of more experience I feel like I also lost something along the way.  When all my training was done by feel I never got injured I was more mentallyemotionally accpeting of bad workouts here and there and I never stalled.  Granted I was a newbie and probably anything would have worked and I was probably leaving a lot of progress on the table in a lot of ways but the upshot was that idea of a plateau didnt exist to me and I always seemed to intuitively know what I needed to dowhat felt right on any given day to get the most out of what I was doing.  I felt like as long as I did that I could just keep making progress forever.  Dont get me wrong learning more of the underlying principles has been great for me but in doing so one of the worst things I ever did was lose that mindset and start pigeon holing myself into certain kinds of programming because xy and z was supposed to be more optimal than whatever I was already doing.
