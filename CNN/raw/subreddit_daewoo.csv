6133647,0,t3_3zkmm0,xposted from rguns I finally finished unbanning my DR.  I picked the rifle up about a month or two ago for around .  It came with the original box unopened bag of accessories and one twenty round magazine.  Ive added DRP pistol grip ACE manufacture stock Birdcage flash hider DRP  degree selector Stormwerkz stock adapter amp folding stock hinge Lage manufacture canted stock adapter Stormwerkz rail Aimpoint PRO DRP piston and oversized charging handleWithout a magazine I have five US made parts now piston charging handle stock pistol grip flash hider and with a US made magazine that brings it to eight parts which if my research is right meets r compliance.I really like this rifle but I havent been able to take it out past sixty feet yet. Im planning on applying for a local gun club that has a hundred yard range so if that works out I should finally be able to reach out a little more with the woo.The Lage canted stock adapter is a lifesaver when the stock is folded because otherwise the charging handle smacks against the stock and would probably end with the charging handle breaking off eventually.  Im really glad I was able to find it.,daewoo,cymtxrp,2,t5_2wfg8
