4297915,0,t1_cs9zgx0,As an example an INFP friend was upset about some students not being allowed to have a rainbowflag as part of their cheerleading act at some event. I told him I didnt find it strange because its a politically active topic and they dont want any of it to become any form of propaganda. But all he saw was me defending that outrageous act and that just fed his anger. It was just a giant wall of me being on the wrong side and nothing I said made any difference. The next day when he was chilled out he was totally open to arguments again though it was strange because he was never even pissed at me just at what was going on.Ti doms have a similar kind of wall though if it helps add some context but the Ti wall is over focusing on a concept or an idea. You get this annoying cicrlejerking where the Ti dom is hyper focused on that small thing that makes all the difference to them and anything not related to that is completely disregarded.I suppose the Fi wall is similar but over focusing on how wrong something feels to you or something?

My siblings are young  and  and in their high school they had students petitioning for and getting gender neutral bathrooms and stuff. I think social media has made for such a great medium for positive social change.

4612344,0,t1_ctburw0,I might be mixing the first  books up a bit with the movie Ive read them all multiple times but those are so long ago that I might be mixing things up.  gt I only recall the books no idea what happened in the movies there.The passive and second guessing behavior is definitely consistent with inferior Fe and ISTP. However have you ever seen an ISTP be a pushover amongst friends? Around strangers sure but with their close friends they tend to have some presence and more importantly be fiercely independent and stubborn.The only times I can recall Ron being stubborn is when hes upset and its in a very unhealthy way. ISTPs dont need to be upset to be stubborn theyre just independent freethinkers by nature. His unhealthy petty behavior just doesnt strike me as a TiFe at all the jealousy in book  or whenever it was when they were no longer friends? What? ISTPs can be petty as fuck but around principles there was no logical consistency what so ever in Rons behavior there it was entirely self absorbed bullshit feelings.Also just to clarify I havent read the books in quite a few years and I havent put a lot of thought into it ENFP was just the first thought that hit me and these are nothing but my first reaction to ISTP.,MBTIPlus,ctbyto2,1,t5_38aq6
4630903,0,t3_3ed9qx,Growing up my father was an ENTJ and mother was an ENFP. Clashed with my mom due to her emotional side and Pness. Im pretty sure I was more of an INTJ when I was younger and I eventually trained myself to be just like my dad because I saw his success wanted to be like that followed his steps etc.. So that is part of why I am an ENTJ. Another part is because of the fact that I was pushed around a lot when I was young because I was kind of small. I ended up growing later in early high school well over  feet. I became huge and became a lot more domineering. In a nutshell I am an ENTJ because I followed the exact footsteps of my dad I clashed with overly emotional family members which was large portion of my family actually and because I was pushed around early in life and overcompensated.,MBTIPlus,cteanra,1,t5_38aq6

Her needs are fulfilled by napping in a pile with me and the SO pretty much. Google chinchilla popcorning and youll see how delightful they are when theyre happy.

4917311,0,t3_3i5ylr,I think it depends on the person. I have a few experiences that come to mind.. I have a coworker from my last job that I used to joke around with etc. We started emailing in the off hours. I think I prefer talking to him via email more. I feel like hes actually putting some thought into it and we share a lot of media that way. We joke around in person but I always read him as being nicer than he is when were emailing.. OKCupid date had awesome messages that made me laugh and I really connected with. He ended up being a huge weird psycho with power issues. Texting him was also awful. But again the messages were great.. Dont tell my boyfriend this but his messages on OKC were adequate. Kind of boring but like he sent me more than a Hey how are you? so I agreed to meet up with him even though based on his messages I wasnt really interested. So. much. better. in person. And even in text. We have a really good beat to our conversation and its really lively. That doesnt come through via message.I definitely think that theres chemistry in a conversation that can be fakedignored when emailing and even texting. I love watching how peoples faces respond and the emotions theyre having when theyre talking to me. Sometimes when messaging I think that people definitely read me wrong and I sometimes think people are being more negative than they are. ,MBTIPlus,cued5f2,2,t5_38aq6

So maybe they do it but just not with me.My experience of xSFJs is that theyre very loyal though at least the ones I know a disagreement or a minor falling out isnt going to affect that loyalty in my experience.

5296367,0,t1_cvons2t,Thank you for engaging this weird post!gtSounds largely social to me is that right? Could it be a mild developmental disorder? Autism spectrum nonverbal learning disorder something like that? It might help to post an example of the kinds of things he does that demonstrate the problem. Argh I feel like cant post examples because Im trying to keep this kind of anonymous and Im too confused to be able to sort the relevant from irrelevant details. edit to be clear its not anyone from reddit.Im reasonably certain that its not in the actual realm of what youre suggesting here meaning this individual isnt autistic or anything in that arena though I can totally see how my vague confused writing would have it appear so.thinkingOkay its like. Um. A contrasting example I have a friend who is by her own current selfdescription nuts right now in the midst of a major relationship breakdown that is triggering all sorts of intense stuff that goes really really deep into her psyche. So she gets depressed and freaked out and is generally not in the worlds emotionally healthiest place. In this space she can be really messedup in some of how how she interacts. But she is aware of this she clearly doesnt like being in this emotionalpsychological space and she is selfdirected in trying to detect and pinpoint what is going wrong in her that she can work on and is actively looking for and moving in various layers of what it will take to get back to some amount of emotional okayness where she isnt in a space that yields the freaking out or depressed or whatever. The contrast from the OP description is that the individual from the OP is someone who will deal with his own emotional problems of whatever sort only when they get so bad that they cant be avoided any more and then will only deal with the most literal and specific and smallest aspects and pieces of those problems required to get to the point where its ignorable again and that will be it. And then at some point something will become nonignorable again and he will again do that sort of rote literal approach again just enough to deal with the smallest and most discrete bits. What does my friend have that this individual doesnt have?Does that help describe it better at all? Im sorry Im so confused and unclear on this.

Your dominant function which is going to be the most prevalent when youre young is automatically going to bring along your inferior function and your secondary function is going to bring along the tertiary function. So right if youre an Fidom child youre going to still have Te its just going to be really rudimentary and less pronounced since when youre a kid you kind of suck at all of your functions anyway since youre just learning how to human.I think they definitely develop in terms of function order though.
