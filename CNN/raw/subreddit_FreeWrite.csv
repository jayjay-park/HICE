7822874,0,t3_4lynx4,I want to feel more. Have you ever felt the actual weight of being caught in a rip tide? The fleeting terror of not knowing which direction is up. Youre pulled in several directions all at once. Arms one direction legs being dragged along the ocean floor in another. Several moments have passed and you just have to breathe. You open your mouth and salt water pours in. Still trapped in the tide. Which way is up? Which way is out. Crash. Sand. Air. Water. Burning in your throat in your belly. Gasping. More completely fill out your metaphor. Regrets do feel like drowning. Breathe it in be pushed down harder. Try to breathe again nothing but burning. Try to escape this water. Try to breathe. Thoughts still wash in. Memories still wash in. Adrenaline. Anger. It all washes in. It burns. The regrets linger. They throw you away and then pool back around at your feet. Inch away. Retreat. But the water still reaches you. ,FreeWrite,d3vcvxm,1,t5_2vay0
