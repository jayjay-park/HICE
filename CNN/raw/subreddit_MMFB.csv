130872,0,t3_1vl4n8,First of all. Dont compare your life to anyone elses. You make your own decision and people close to you should respect your choises. Be happy for your siblings and their happiness and realize being happy for them doesnt take anything away from you. Siblings are something more siblings are blood and blood is thicker than water.Good relationship arent that common. If you love her thats awesome and you should make her see your love in any ways possible. But keep in mind the realities of life and dont spread yourself too thin. Long distance relationships need a lot of strenght and trust and if you have that in your relationship thats just wonderful.Youre free not to do anything that you dont feel conformtable doing. If you feel like that your ex is trying to play some game of moral superiority then just call if off and tell her that you dont really care about doing favors for her. Not because shes a bad person but because you have your own life and shes not a part of it.,MMFB,cetc2se,1,t5_2sjdn

176420,0,t3_1w3wq9,If this person is anything like myself maybe such is the case that he wants a bit of privacy.Over the years I tend to go through various periods of fluctuation  I can be open and sociable for a couple of months to a couple of years doing lots of volunteering and being active in the community but eventually I get to a point where I feel the need to be more reserved. Ill push people away go into my inner shell and just live alone taking a break from the community and plodding along with life without wanting to be social. For me this normally lasts for a couple of months to years and then the cycle repeats.It may be that something is on your friends mind and thats why theyre retreating a bit from social life.I think that the best way you can feel better and get the answers youre looking for is to let them know how you feel. Tell them that youre worried that theyre acting out of character and you wanted to make sure everything is okay with them.I dont agree with the advice to just move on and forget about it  from my experience theres more than likely to be a legitimate reason your friend is acting this way and ignoring it wont put your mind at ease.Only by finding out can you put your mind at ease but you need to do so in a way that doesnt risk your work relationship. I would say that the best way to do this is by expressing concern and stepping back if the individual starts to get awkward or aggressive. That way you let him know that youve noticed a difference and if you dont find out then you hopefully will at a later date when your friend decides to confide in you.,MMFB,ceyj1ef,2,t5_2sjdn

245712,0,t3_1wx8z9,Hey there! Lets take it one by one. So I guess in you have a problem with being ignored in social media. It should not be as important as it is but it has grown on me too so I get you. No offence but I personally dont like people pouring their hearts out in public. I also dont like quotes or stupid motivational quotes for that matter. Lets leave her weight out of the question but this girl with the quote has built an audience and they are her like slaves. Probably similar girls real life friends or simply just fans of the same band. You dont need these people to reassure you. But if you really want well.. you need to start liking your friends statuses find people with similar interests and dont be picky. Love can come from places that you dont consider priority at this point. Anyway fuck social media. If you can be happy without that kind of feedback thats the best.So your friends dont invite you to parties. I believe that you need to start building individual relationships with them so each and one of them will feel responsible to invite you. Along the process you might find out that some of them are not worthy of being friends but thats fine. Of course I dont know what is your relationship with these guys really but its hard to believe that theyre scared of you doing something gay. Have you tried  hanging out with gay people? Not that you should escape into that but just to give you an edge and confidence you can apply in your social life.Anyways I just have a feeling that you dont see things on a large scale and youre too much stuck in your facebook feed and a small group of asshole friends while the world offers so much more and you should just go for it.,MMFB,cf67y4s,3,t5_2sjdn

Do you do the things you do because you want it or because someone else wants you to? lt My heart goes to you. I have been feeling very much like you in the past.Thank you.  I hope youre personally feeling much better yourself.I think the problem is... No...  I dont want to do them.  I honestly dont.  I also dont want to get up sometimes.  I also dont want to go to work every day.  If it were up to me right now... I would just lay there.  No music no movies no books no sounds.  Just lay there.  And I think thats part of the problem.  I honestly havent had a lot of therapy but I did go to some group meetings and they suggested that I do hobbies in hopes that I can start feeling again and I think its important that I find something that makes me happy.  and part of that is actually accomplishing things... Even if theyre small goals.But I get what youre saying.  I will try to take it easy when I can and not stress out too much.  I definitely do that.gtIs it the same when you watch movies good tv shows and listen to tapes? Maybe you can start with that.Do you let yourself relax sometimes? Not doing much not being on the internet but more maybe taking a walk. Not thinking. Just feeling the wind. Looking at the leaves. Feeling the sun. Do you ever go out and enjoy nature all alone? Most of the time I can get through a movie.  Barely.  But a lot of the time I get lost in my mind and lose where Im at... Or Im watching... but not  focused.  My mind is still chugging along.Music is a totally different story.  I cant listen to a single song.  I cant pay attention to the words or tune longer than  seconds.I dont let myself relax a lot.  Youre right.  Im also online far too much.  For my job and when I get home. But its really hard to relax.  It feels like I have to put all this effort just to relax.  I used to take walks and sometimes I was alright... but sometimes I come back home feeling lonely and looking at all the people and thinking about things that make me feel worse.  For example I went out with some people for my birthday on a camping trip.  Everyone wanted to go camping and I volunteered my birthday as an excuse... That way no one would have to get me anything.. We could all just take the time out and go camping.  For some reason I was absolutely miserable.  No reason.  Camping was my idea.  I just couldnt get into it.  The days ran on I came home and now its all just a blur already.I was kinda hoping I could get away from it all... but it followed me.,MMFB,cg7pof5,1,t5_2sjdn

Find out what hes passionate about something that he wouldnt just say I dont know. A lot of the times when I say I dont know is because its a much easier response than to really think and explain the problem.

817963,0,t3_23gv3b,Sorry about you having to experience this. My family had a shih tzu who when I think was  years old starting having seizures.The first two were fairly spread out and we didnt really know what was going on. After that they starting becoming more and more frequent over the next four years. For a long time it was to the point that he would have them every  days. He was on one medicine for awhile which proved ineffective. Then another still no results.Eventually he had one really bad one mustve lasted half an hour. We gave him some emergency medicine thing that was administered rectally which basically was to calm him down so the seizure stopped shortly thereafter and he rested for the next couple hours. Then he was back to himself.About two years ago when he was  he had another big one which kept going right through the emergency medicine and didnt stop for an hour. In order for it to stop my parents had to take him to a vet who gave him a shot of something. For the next day he couldnt walk more than a step or two before falling down and was wetting himself. We had to put him down that day. The seizures may have been caused if your dog was bred with dogs whore related to each other. We believe that may have been a cause for it. Our dogs parents were I think father and daughter. I know its sad and scary to see especially since there isnt much you can do when its happening other than make sure they wont get hurt on something.

If we dont have such a birthday we feel that we have been jilted in some way and think that life is not fair and we feel alone. Our feeling of being alone and sad for ourselves comes from this  expectations of celebration on our birthday.

It hurts so much.My best suggestion is to write out exactly how you feel as if you were going to send it to her. You dont have to send it just be honest to yourself and her on a piece of paper. Then shred that paper. You cant dwell but you need to address the issue. Its not easy in the slightest but you may find yourself feeling better.And ulittleraindrop is right. It will be okay. To be honest after reading your comments I feel like I can relate to you an insane amount. I had an extremely challenging childhood. I have those swings of emotion and Im losing the person who got me through them.Its not easy and it hurts so much but one thing keeps me going I know it gets better.

1543954,0,t3_2bx7mi,Social connections are essential to humans we are pack animals. A lack of these relationships can cause depression fear and some studies of even shortening ones lifespan. Ive noticed in independent people giving up social connections is far easier for them if it is in means of helping themselves. For example my girlfriend is VERY independent while I am very dependent. This causes issues she seems so willing to pack up and leave me in the dust chasing her dreams while my big life plan is to follow her. It seems youre having a similar situation. Being surrounded by independent people as you claim you may be more dependent then them which makes the relationship harder to establish. The best thing you can do is have complete faith in yourself and understand that you have control of where your life goes. Reinvent yourself practice extroverted skills to build a friend base. Basically put yourself out there and meet people. Dont allow yourself to feel unnoticed or invisible. Build a large variety of acquaintances some will respond badly that happens. But others could turn out to become the best of friends. P.S. Never be afraid to attempt family bonding or expressing to them how youre feeling.  of the time family members will understand and have a loving response.

Plus the toilet is the place to think these thoughts. Having your junk out resting on the cold porcelain and you free ball is apparently conducive to help centering your self. I alas lack this as a girl I dont have balls and a penis  but my SO tells me he does this when he needs to think. I think the female equivalent is taking your bra off at the end of a long gym session and getting a scratch where your bra strap intersects with your shoulder  I digress.   First and foremost  welcome to the world of thoughts. It is awesome that you have thoughts and are intelligent and have started down the road of early existential angst. You must split them up in to different categories of helpful and not helpful or come back to it laterneed more information at a later date. So clearly the unhelpful would be the depression the numb the angry the frustrated the bored crying unhappy stuff that might not be a good reflection on whats going on right now.The useful would be the  Why? Is there more to it? Can I define it? What could I do right now that would help? Ambition thought care love... These are useful. Then after the category stuff ensure  hygiene clean room clean house exercise clean eating being helpful and clearly communicating is up to date. Ensure school work part time work and chores are squared away. Talk to parents to get a gauge on whats coming up and what they need from you. Ensure all communication aspects are in a warm positive manor. Identify any problems you might not have been able to spot by listening to other people and being sure you understand them.

1827115,0,t1_ck9c21v,I dont have much to go off of but here are a few things that might help. First and you may have done this already but who knows? lay everything out. Give your wife a big warm hug sit her down and ask her to tell you all of her concerns. Tell her you want to know absolutely everything even if shes embarrassed or doesnt want to hurt your feelings or whatever. As this is happening be sure to ask questions if you feel you dont understand something. Its dangerous to make assumptions during these types of conversations and your questions will show her you have genuine interest in her feelings. Make sure you set aside plenty of time for this. It could take a while. Now based on what Ive read in your post history this next part could be tough. Its time to communicate and you need to respond. If shes presented any problems that youre both willing to work through not enough sex not helping around the house working too much whatever it is discuss those problems right then and there. Tell her what you want ask her what she wants and then do your best to compromise. Once thats done tell her just like youve told us that you love her dearly that you dont mean to be so closed off and youre trying that youre willing to go the extra mile with something like therapy to make you both happy again. Then give her hand a squeeze and see how she responds.Once youve done all this if either of you are not willing to put in the work then its time to move on. If youd like some more concrete advice more details about your struggles would be helpful. Good luck.   ,MMFB,ck9cx7z,3,t5_2sjdn
1848328,0,t3_2fm3hd,Coming out was definitely one of the most difficult things Ive ever had to do.The first thing any questioning guy has to do on this journey is to come out to themselves. You seem to have taken this step which is not an easy thing to do so congrats!I had my first very confusing gay feelings when I was  there was a guy on my football team that I had a massive crush on. For whatever reason I felt this was something I had to hide. Our family isnt religious and I live in Canada but somehow it was imparted to me that this was something to be hidden Be it from media or perhaps subtle hints from family members friends or teachers. Whatever the cause I started pushing any gay feelingsthoughts away. Forcing myself to fap to straight porngirls I knew only worked for so long  my thoughts would always drift to guys I knew and had seen naked. The denial continued throughout highschool and it was causing some very serious anxiety. I kept telling myself that I just hadnt found the right girl or other rationalisations like Im probably bi. It wasnt until my th year of university that I finally accepted myself. The signs were too blatant.. I was a  year old virgin who never had a girlfriend. After finally admitting to myself I was a bit of a basket case. I wanted to tell somebody but I didnt know who. This is the point youre at now.After some furious internal debate that literally went on for months I chose to come out to my best girl friend. Women are the best to come out to unless theyre in love with you which also happened to me in th year but thats another story. After coming out to my best girl friend I felt so much better. Finally there was somebody to talk to about these things. It was at least at first our shared secret. She had suspected before and wasnt surprised. She was and still is extremely supportive it made our relationship much stronger. This is the second step. This is a kind of all or nothing admission because theres not really any going back after this. Other people know now and thats actually a really good thing. Step  is to expand your circle of friends who know and support you. I found I preferred to have my girl friend tell other people on my behalf  it was much easier that way for me. Coming out directly to guys has always been very difficult and still is so this is a good way around that. Step  is coming out to family members. This is a very tough one to address and I wont do so here. So Id like to make you feel better about the whole thing because what youre experiencing is extremely common among young gay men. Very normal The reason you cant come out but want to is like I said before theres no coming back from it. You probably recognize this on at least a subconscious level  saying those two words Im gay literally changes the course of your life forever. Nobody chooses to be gay. I know this to be true down to the very core of my being. This is a singular irrefutable truth that you need to keep with you at all times. You can size anybody up instantly by finding out where they stand on this. Almost every single antihomosexual argument can be traced back to the issue of choice. Remember saying you can choose your sexual orientation is like saying you can choose your skin colour. Its like your life has been a highway up until this point  youve been cruising along in relative comfort going about your life. Suddenly you start seeing signs for an exit up ahead. This is the exit you know deep down inside that you should take but it leads to a completely different highway that deviates and takes a very different route to your destination. Unlike the main highway you dont have a complete map of this road and youll most likely be taking it alone. Just know that while both roads ultimately end up in the same place one is much more difficult to navigate than the other. Neither are easy. Its time to take your exit.,MMFB,ckbx39w,2,t5_2sjdn
1870545,0,t3_2fyuh6,I like your ideas regarding distractions being used as emotional comfort for people and its good that you reject that. There are a lot of ways to fight emotional discomfort but why do you experience it in the first place?You resent women and place yourself on a pedestal above the people who surround you is this a way for you to compensate for loneliness? Do you share no emotional connections because everyone else is too stupid to understand you or is it something else? Do you conduct yourself this way to purposefully isolate yourself from others thereby reducing the likelihood of you being rejected by them?,MMFB,ckeleac,1,t5_2sjdn

You might want to pick up some books from the library about the field of communications or psychology. You could also read something like Dale Carnegies How to win friends and influence people. Even though it might seem foreign to you as I take you as the more introverted kind of person. Im  and work in the computer sector but Ive studied communication and psychology.

Should I just leave them alone if they dont deserve me? This is a mindset that doesnt really help anything.Sit down and think about all the things you have in your lifeeven if its just food or a roof over your head. This might be hard. You can write it down if it helps. Let yourself cry. Give yourself opportunity to grieve. Dont hurt yourself. If you feel like hurting yourself you should call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at    go to a trusted family member or if its really serious call . You might hate yourself right now. Work on not hating yourself. Watch some funny Youtube videos and make yourself laugh. Eat something you like.

3902843,0,t3_3555fv,Im sorry I dont have time to thoroughly read this right now but these few things are apparent even from the title. Ill try my best to come back but I might not for a couple weeks even.  Because its a common problem Ill assume poor high school grades are because you are memorizing the application of your subjects matters  instead of understanding it. You will not fully get thing until you feel comfortable teaching them to someone say a year younger. Dont try to memorize the material. Understand it. It takes out the need to study the effort in homework and the stress of doing well. Many people skip the why part of learning and just focus on the do. I get that some stuff is just boring and unappealing but YOU WILL FEEL GOOD if you just will yourself to ACTUALLY do it. Plus learning the stuff now works wonders in college. Only you will know if youre bullshitting yourself. And if you are ever lying to yourself you dont disserve to do well. SorryAlso learn how to get good at procrastinating. It is a value skill. Ill let you figure this one out  but if you want more ask and Ill eventually get back. As for the whole love situation.How many people actually marry for their highschool bfgf in terms of percent? Lets say . of the united states population Assuming mil population and about  married that is not many people at all. Do you think your special enough to be a part of that small group?Also ask yourself TRUTHFULLY. What does she offer that other people dont  cant?Your most likely answers are her personality the distance she lives or the fact that she even gives you the time of day. But think about it other people can fill those holes easily! Plus YOU HAVE ONLY LIVED ABOUT  YEARS. Do you honestly think that out of the hopefully about  years that you would have already solved that puzzle already? It takes most people  years!! You have so much more time. It sucks but one day it will fall put of the sky when you least expect it. Conclusion.Leave her. There are millions of people around you. Billions exist. Why limit your search to one person who is upsetting you and that doesnt seem to be anything to special!?!Write down your problems. Sleep.

4102510,0,t3_37koeq,Been there on both sides. I think youre right to feel anxious theres a problem. Its totally fixable but its hard. You have to be dedicated and ready to do emotionally difficult things.Let me start with the positive though. Youre snooping because you care. You want to find nothing which would have made you feel better. You want everything to be wonderful. You want a loving relationship and you have a lot of love to give. So many people would be so happy to have half that level of adoration from their partner. This isnt a flaw in you if anything you just havent expressed your passion through the healthiest outlet Now the problem is that youre self conscious paranoid and actively seeking out problems to eliminate even ones that may not exist. Youre putting more and more pressure on your partner and eventually it will drive him away. Since he hasnt left yet theres still time.Id say write down a list of everything youve ever enjoyed. Buying nice clothes somewhere you enjoyed going friends you liked even if you dont talk to them anymore. Make this list gigantic include even the smallest details.Now commit yourself to doing them all. Focus on you. When you met your partner he loved you because you loved yourself and shared that with him. Now hes feeling like everything is riding on him to perform and youre no longer a person he can lean on or get satisfaction from without his volunteering his own energy.When youre in love with you again hell naturally gravitate back toward you. You have to not want him so much. You gotta love doing your own thing so much that maybe he gets a little jealous. And thats when he starts to pursue you like before I hope this helps.

But I cant tell them.I stopped playing with half the people that get on the mumble server I get on a voice communication program. One reason is because someone kept saying sorry that they hadnt spend time with me and promised they would... Over... And over... And over. It started after she got tired about me trying to update everyone when I saw the doctors. I didnt want to hear it and think about the day youll be gone... So she stops talking to me... As a fix... Uhg...Two years I was patient then lost my normal personality and became unforgiving. I said no more go never will we be friends again never will I fall for your lies.And with the rest that she spends time with they wouldnt invite me to play games Id try to join in and would never get server info and shit. One day while complaining about it they got pissed and said that if I wanted to join them. I blew up on them... One of the original admins of the Minecraft server I met them all on said I was right that he saw it happen all the time. I couldnt join them and would complain because they wouldnt give me the info I needed and they wouldnt give me the info without me asking because they hated when I complained.I understand why he didnt speak up he probably wasnt sure why they were ignoring me when I asked for info.

4834167,0,t3_3h2oxn,HeyFirstly your honesty here is awesome its much appreciated. Im going to start by saying something that has helped me accomplish what needed to be done even when I felt absolutely worthless in the eyes of others.Time will pass no matter what you choose to do with it we all get older even the younger more beautiful people in the world today will be in your shoes in due time. Its never too late to accomplish your goals yeah youre a few years older and theres nothing wrong with that. The mind has absolute power over the body we can be our own worst enemies when it comes to selfcritical judgment.I know it sounds redundant but before you can let anyone else in your life you need to first show yourself the love and care youd like to share with someone else only then can you lay the foundation for a stable relationship otherwise from my own personal experiences even after entering a relationship those feelings will still be there. It starts from there there is no one walking the planet who will fill that longing emptiness in you  With that said what youre feeling is perfectly normal youre smart enough to know better than to honestly blame women for your current position. Try not to look at women or anyone on this planet as wanting anything from you we all have our desires and needs sometimes these are not attributed to one set person more of ideals and endearing qualities people look for in others sometimes we just arent what someone else is looking for. Far from the greatest feeling in the world Hell Ive def been there more than a few times haha but you cant change that  dont allow anyone elses expectations to define you.In my honest opinion you need to stop for a second and clear your mind ask yourself what do you want to do today? Do exactly what you want to do allow yourself to be selfish for a change and focus on your own needs and desires your own happiness  this has helped me clear unwantedoverwhelming negativity. Once you keep doing this be good to yourself as silly as it sounds you will find yourself waking up each day with a healthier happier outlook As for reigniting that fire regaining your optimism for the future  understand that you are having these feelings of dread and worthlessness not because theres a shred of truth to any of them but because its your own selfdestructive reaction to your perceived road block. Anxiety amp Self Loathing are both seen a lot in teens but that doesnt mean adults dont also suffer from this. You sound like a solid person you have a good heart please dont sell yourself short  Not to drag this on here but Ill give you a personal example Im in my s and all these years Ive wanted to learn to drive but I was too afraid to put myself out there most people have no idea I have this anxiety like I kept procrastinating telling myself I wasnt good enough or Id never get my license or I was gonna crash or something but I sat down and forced myself to study that learners book every chance I got. This past week I passed the test and have been practicing driving since then I know now I am good enough and though it took me so many years to accomplish such a minor goal it was all in my head the whole time. I aced that fucking test and though Im like twice as old as the kids at the dmv it feels pretty damn good finally standing up to that irrational stupid fear haha its like a weight lifted as silly as it sounds since to most people a license is something you get while still in highschool let alone when youre almost old enough to be some of these kids parent haha. I have so many other goals now that are also becoming a reality this tiny step in the right direction has opened my eyes all because even though I didnt feel ready I was in such a rut for so long I allowed myself to settle in the mindset of never accomplishing these things until I finally put myself out there and will continue to keep doing it You can do it too it may not feel like it some days but just know by default as long as you keep going youre allowing yourself make it one step closer to your goals. I apologize if this is more of a ramble here but I wanted to let you know Ive been there its not fun but if a  year old with what boiled down to zero motivation and a fear of failure can say fuck it and go for it break down the steps and youll see your happiness isnt as far off as you may think  Id better get some sleep here have a great weekend I hope you think about what I said be good to yourself amp take care ,MMFB,cu3vwas,2,t5_2sjdn

It helped a friend of mine back on their feet haha after some pretty hefty knee damage.Experience after college is always a tricky venture. Especially at . Ive been there.

5317282,0,t3_3nue1m,It doesnt sound like youre in the U.S. UK I guess? so I cant really offer much that is specific about getting into the university of your choice. Do you have to option of going to one of the others you visited? It sounds like you are worried about missing out on the uni experience being around people your age of like mindset in an academic community etc.... So a second choice seems like it might be a better option than not going. If another uni is a possibility could you do a year there and then transfer? Or would it be possible to take a gap year get a job and save some money perhaps travel for part of the time and retake your exams next year? not sure if you meant exams in your current school work or entrance exams or something like the SATACT in the U.S.Just trying to throw some ideas out there. I dont know what your options are but most of the time people have many more choices than they think they do. Often they just need someone to start saying what about ... this or that to help them break out of their binary I can get what I wantI cant frame of mind. If you can your best next step might be to talk to someone in the engineering school at the university you want to go to explain your situation and see if they can offer advice or other options you might pursue.However it works out though it wont be the end of the world. It might suck for a while but you will get over it and hopefully learn from it.Good luck to you.,MMFB,cvrcfsn,2,t5_2sjdn

5363592,0,t3_3ogs3b,Very good idea of writing letters. Writing stuff down often can really help to get things ideas feelings and thoughts sorted out some more. Structure in your life will allow you to feel more in control. Good thinking!Secondly its good to be able to recognise possible problems you may have. Thats the first step to fixing them as if they mean youjre broken  they dont you just get better and better. However from what I read in your text maybe it would be an idea to visit a psychologist. They could really help you get to the bottom of your problems allowing for the most control and effective growth you could achieve.That being said go for that writing initiative! Perhaps you can start a group with people that would like to sort their lives thoughts... out through writing and you could definitely send each other letters to help each other out!

Second suicide invalidates just about all types of insurance.  Third there are things you can do to get help with all these situations and Im surprised no one has informed you about them.Social Security due to injury and Medicare as well as State programs are all available for you and your family.  You paid into these systems so its not like youre taking money from someone.  You need to get to your local state office now.  Food stamps are pretty much guaranteed within  days sooner if you declare an emergency.  WIC and CHIPS are available for your wife and children.  Major disabilities like yours loss of an arm are generally covered by SS if you paid into the system long enough.  There are also outreach programs Americans with Disabilities Act also provides help.  Churches also will lend a hand in a pinch even if you arent a member as long as your show them whats wrong.You need to get in touch with your state office asap.,MMFB,cxnciwx,6,t5_2sjdn

But some of the times I have felt the most terrible was for shit like this. No its not a big deal but I always feel sooo bad. The embarrassment is painful and replays in your head. What was I thinking? goes on over and over. Theres this weird sinking feeling at being called out for something. I dont know if I can make you feel better but I want you to know that everyone has had a moment like this in their life and that maybe the people who came up to you were doing so because they saw themselves. Im sure there were people who were annoyed with you but there were probably also people that have done similar things before.

6796723,0,t3_48rivy,I know its more important for you to feel better than it is for you to get advice in this situation but it sounds like you might care a little too much. Theres this concept called the scarcity trap where a lack of a resource prompts someone to behave in a manner that makes it less likely theyll gain more of that resource. If youre poor you tend to be demoralized and not want to look after your money because is that  Wendys meal really going to be the difference between being poor and being rich? Youre always going to be poor so...Its a similar thing for social interaction. If youre desperate for someones attention and respect it can prompt you to act in ways that are likely to drive that person away. Youll tend to act and behave as nonoffensively as possible making you boring  or youll try so hard to win their respect that theyll just get sick of you trying to prove youre smart or whatever.I guess what Im trying to say is maybe you should care a little less. Its not healthy to be so wrapped up in your relationship with another person that their loss completely destroys you. You should never absolutely need to be around someone  if you do the relationship will likely self destruct.Try to put this from your mind and just move on. You dont need this one person in your life to be happy. Youll make many new friends in the years ahead if you just be yourself and let those who like you find you on their own.,MMFB,d0mp73m,1,t5_2sjdn

It sucked because my high school wasnt so large so I was trapped in that bubble through the whole four years. Im sorry this might not be helping you but it just feels nice to know I wasnt the only one to go through this experience.You seem like a confident person so thats good.This is what I think. You can take it or leave depending if it helps you. You DIDNT fuck up. People change. The friends I used to hang out with eventually became part of the popular cliche of my school. I didnt. I didnt adapt once they were gone. Instead I was left without any cliche to join. Its honestly difficult to find new friends. The most important thing is to be OPEN towards becoming friends with people even those you dont immediate click with. Because when they come you better be prepared to welcome them.Aside from that prepare for the time you move out such as moving out for college. Fix your persona so that when you enter college where everyone is new youll have better chances of finding new friends and new things to add meaning to your life. This sounds easier than it is but its the best option in my opinion.Im sorry for the unsolicited advice and for continuously bringing up my experience when this should be about you.

7992689,0,t3_4oobpx,I told myself I am never going to be in a relationship unless I try at least.This is correct.  And then you tried.  MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!Seriously way to go.  Getting started with asking girls out is super difficult.  Its definitely a bit soul crushing at first but it will get easier and easier.  Eventually you realize that getting rejected doesnt actually matter since there are so many other girls out there.  Even when you dont get rejected a lot of times youll go out on a date or two and realize that you and the girl dont really click.It also sounds like youre placing a lot of your happiness in being in a relationship.  Thats a dangerous path to go down.  Happiness needs to be on you.  Like girls can increase or decrease your happiness but they should never  be the reason for your happiness or lack thereof.  Also if youre happy all on your own girls will flock to you.Luckily the soul crushingness of rejection makes for a great time to analyze yourself and improve the things that make you unhappy.  Think youre unattractive?  Start going to the gym.  Think your a bad dancer?  Sign up for some salsaswing classes.  Worried that your not confident enough? Go to the gym or do something physical like a sport not sure why this works but it does.  Basically improve yourself until youre happy alone then choose the woman that boosts your happiness the most.,MMFB,d4egcx1,4,t5_2sjdn

8044899,0,t3_4pdsnr,Cajun French is far more interesting a dialect and language that proper standard stuffy French. It isnt even right to call that version The French Language because there are regional dialects in all the various provinces of France. Just as she laughed at your dialect she would get laughed at in the rural Loire region or in Bordeaux. Shit the only reason she gets to call it French is because the stale boring and overwrought shit is what everyone has to teach overseas completely disregarding the richness of regionality or Cajun French.  Proper. Pfft. As if. As if she called a Walkman a balladeur instead of Le Walkman like every normal French person did back when Walkmans were a thing.  So its clear that shes a stuck up bitch. Anyone who truly enjoys savors and appreciates language would be excited to learn about the differences in a dialect. The kind of my version is better than your version shit is the kind of thing I grew up with hearing Brits talk about weird American vocabulary like elevator bathroom and line instead of the proper lift loo and queue and vice versa. Its the kind of shitty conversation you make when you first meet someone at a bar because you have nothing better to talk about than the most superficial of differences.  However its also fair to say that even though youre in the right here you didnt handle the situation in the best way. Thats not to say you did anything wrong. But stuck up bitches require special handling I think we can agree on that.  Avoid her if you can. If you can muster some Louisiana panache you can laugh her off and say that Cajun is just too spicy for her and stick to the more milquetoast English. But yeah chin up. Shes a bitch.

8187888,0,t3_4rftkp,Hey Im really sorry youre going through this. But honestly I think its more how youre looking back on your past relationships that didnt work out and of course pretty much all relationships dont work out with the exception of the very few that last permanently right?. I dont assume I know exactly how you think or feel but I know that when Im in a bad state because of something thats happened Ill look back on my past and construct a very negative narrative that pulls evidence in the most hopeless view possible. I wonder if something similar is going on with you with what has just happened with your ex.Heres how I see it you appear to be judging your selfworth on relationships that like most relationships dont work out and how well you do in an environment bars that isnt suited for you since you said youre shy and awkward. I dont think the most accurate conclusion here to draw would be that youre just not attractive enough to sustain a relationship because I think it makes far more sense for someone unattractive to be unable to start a relationship in the first place rather than have it be used as an excuse for why they think it wouldnt work out a while down the line. Besides the archetype of a tall and heavyset man is arguably just as popular with women as the conventional lightweight model type the same way curvy women arent single forever because theyre not skinny and modelesque. From what I can see your problem isnt really that youre just physically unattractive  and even if you were thats certainly not a reason you wouldnt be able to find a lasting and successful relationship  and you and your friends like your personality. Perhaps what you really need is better luck finding someone who appreciates you as well. Im sorry if I come off unsympathetic trust me Im not someone who believes just saying everyone is beautiful to everyone and anyone is truthful or helpful. Im just hoping to offer an alternative opinion in the case youre being overly hard on yourself and I apologize if Im totally off the mark. Either way I hope you feel better and remember to be kind to yourself.,MMFB,d511dek,3,t5_2sjdn

8444278,0,t1_d5wqd3g,Thank you for that. I know that hurting myself would hurt others just as much as it hurts me which ultimately trumps my urge to do harmfulthoughtless things. Youre right.. it will really hurt but I think I know what I have to do. I cant allow someone to control my life with their pettiness. Its just going to be really hard getting to a point where I feel like life is normal again. In any case thank you so much for taking some time to give me advice.

You are embarking on a great adventure youre an adult now and these are the times you will come back to in memory when you hit hard heartbreaking times in your future.Its normal to be nervous and even afraid.  New and different is scary.  Being outside of your comfort zone is scary.  BUT you have courage to recognize that the fear of the unknown is the worst part and accept it and revel in the newness and the joy of the adventure.,MMFB,d6vgzhd,6,t5_2sjdn

9124312,0,t1_d82f4lq,You probably dont care but your comment became a sounding board for me. And I just wanted to say I kind of had a break through this week. I hit a very low low  week ago today bringing me back to your original comment for perspective and comfort. And with some help of a counselor and friends this week Ive been able to mentally wrap around the things that were really stopping me from progressing and I feel SO much better than I have in weeks even months. Thanks for comforting in times of needing comfort. ,MMFB,d88ldkq,2,t5_2sjdn
9175016,0,t3_55y87p,Its easy to become sentimental about the nice things you remember but you have to face reality that the relationship had too many flaws to sustain it.

9647806,0,t3_5cw15c,Never give up my friend tomorrow your wildest dreams could come true.  The best thing for depression i have learned through my life is that HOPE is the best medicine.  Never lose hope its important to focus on the good things you have instead of dwelling on the bad.  For instance your young you can still do anything you want to with your life there are still a million doors open to you.  you have friends and family thats huge Im  years older than you my life sucks Im miserable and alone no friends no family the only thing I have in this life is my dog and she loves me and that helps me through the really dark times.  Just stick in there man  was wholly a crappy year for us and thank the lord its almost over.  Heres to  mate.,MMFB,da2aiw9,2,t5_2sjdn

9895465,0,t1_daxbu3v,Thanks for the kind reply and for sharing your story  it resonated with me as well. I am also medicated and have taken measures to reduce my stress and know that disheartening feeling of still not being able to handle as much as the average person.I am so glad to hear that you found a position that you enjoy and is sustainable. I hope to get there one day. Wishing you all the very best with work and health ,MMFB,daxeid1,1,t5_2sjdn
9942351,0,t3_5gy7v9,It could be one of two things Hes saying that to get back at you because hes hurting like JiForce has mentioned Hes pissed off that he didnt get what he wanted whatever reason in his mind that he was dating you for and decided to tell you that you were nothing more than a piece of ass for himEither way hes a douche. Guys that do that generally arent going to take breakups or fights well. Best to stay away from that accept hes gone and do your best to move on with life and find someone else that wont treat you that way even if things went sour,MMFB,db3igql,2,t5_2sjdn

10006895,0,t3_5iy7ni,Sounds rough. Just be completely transparent with your school and be actively communicating with them. I dont know what made you start cutting but cutting is not suicide its just a way for your body to release its own pain relievers to make you feels better. I mean I used to punch shit like the floor which would bruise my hands pretty bad but it felt good.The fact is that you have another opportunity its not a hopeless attempt. Plus sleep deprivation makes you say weird shit you dont mean.,MMFB,dbbxduv,3,t5_2sjdn

10504636,0,t3_5qed4e,Forget your business for now and adjust your sleep cycles to coincide with your childs. Sleep when she sleeps and wake when she wakes and hold her against you while you both do so.

10935996,0,t1_de7uav0,I like how youre trying to fix yourself its admirable. Thats usually the hardest part admitting that you have this problem. That said it could be something as simple as kindness. They may make more money than you have have all the time in the world to goof around while you run rings around the room and trust me Ive been in that situation but your focus should just stay on doing the best you can each day. I think if youd take the focus off others and up your game on your own performance youd actually have a leg to stand on to ask for a raise maybe not Monday but definitely this year. I think itd do your self esteem some good. That seems to be where a lot of your problem lies and thats how you think of yourself. youve already learned you cant drink or drug it away.  Look up Dale Carnegie books on how to deal with others and also how to make yourself a better person. If this was me Id work on finding a spiritual side to myself not necessarily religious and nurture it. You have to learn how to keep your core self a peaceful place to be. I wish you luck.,MMFB,de7yyyb,3,t5_2sjdn

It might help me meet new people and still being able to drum would be amazingly helpful for calming me.Thats also good advice for getting past hard times.
