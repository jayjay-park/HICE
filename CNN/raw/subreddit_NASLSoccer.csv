Well apparently there was another team able to do that. And while I greatly admire what FTL and Gunter Kronsteiner have accomplished and appreciate the unbeaten run theyre on a focused San Antonio at home will be difficult to contain. They have lots of attackers but also a solid back line and GK. All that said the NASLD has a a bit of a tradition of the lowestseeded playoff clubs managing to win the championship. It happened when Puerto Rico won in  and NSC Minnesota Stars won in  and the Stars almost did the same thing in  the last time D had postseason playoffs. It seems the last team in always comes in on a hot streak and a head of steam so FTL will be a tough out and in Fafa Picault they have the most talented player on the pitch.

The Facebook App is pretty bad in terms of congested view ease of use data storage amp bandwidth drain compared to the Twitter App. Almost every cellular plan amp home internet plans have what Americans would consider extremely low usage limits.Additionally the news has repeatedly been abuzz with the privacy policy issues that Facebook repeatedly has including how it violates Canadian Privacy Policy laws nearly every time Facebook changes its policy.

Its a hell of an entertaining system but its a big part of what contributes to the insane wealth disparity in world football i.e. the biggest clubs almost never go down and even if they do theyre never hurt like the smaller clubs are.What I foresee and hope for the NASL is to be a strong independent and financially viable second division.  That means cities that can never get an MLS team can still host exciting topquality soccer in a professional atmosphere.  Thats the only way were going to grow the game in the US.  Neither MLS nor NASL ever has to become the NFL.

Its parasitically taken over a floundering league in USL and the host is just the shell by which it operates.  Without the parasite the host dies.  Its not a symbiotic relationship at all.Youre saying that the NASL wants to break tradition and do something different.  So what?  Is that bad for soccer?  Well its bad for MLS and USL but not for the game.

If USL owners will now have to go through the onerous bonding and expansion processes necessary to meet the D standards then aside from the MLS connection whats the benefit of playing in a league you dont own dont control fully and have to continue to pay franchise fees to?  Its even more puzzling when you factor in that MLSs financial contribution to each team in the form of development players will make up a much smaller proportion of their operating budgets.Whats even stranger is that people dont seem to realize that USL wouldnt have half of their expansion clubs if they had forced them to meet the NASL minimums.  The reason there are more  and more on the West Coast  is that they cost less to own and operate.

Detroit only if spawned from DCFC   MSA and  media market. San Diego   MSA and  media market fills a west coast market and little major sports competition outside the Chargers as long as theyre still there. Charlotte  one of the few USL markets thats vulnerable to solid NASL ownership incursion. Its  MSA and  media market with a population that far overdue a solid pro soccer club.. Las Vegas  yes you read that right. Its  MSA with est. population growth of over  since . And theres absolutely no major sports competition some will say theres a reason for that. Its the sort of underserved large market that the NASL should try. Phoenix  if Arizona United FC goes under or perhaps even if it doesnt the NASL should finally organize a proper club in this top large market.

Nestor had some great ideas but if he had followed that path wed still be fighting for a SSS in that area.  He had no friends on the city council and they fought him tooth and nail.  Tampa was a dead end for the team and St. Pete bent over backwards to bring the team there.You have to admit that the atmosphere and layout of Al Lang is pretty much ideal compared to what we endured at Steinbrenner.Did we lose marketshare in Tampa?  Yes  but not due to the Rowdies absence and more to the fact that OCSC moved in.  The Rowdies suffered from a severe lack of intelligent marketing and pretty much surrendered the mind share.

7533996,0,t1_d2yiuzw,gtOK Ill explain it to you slowly using small words. I think you need to learn larger words. gt One principal owner means one majority owner.No no it doesnt. They would have said majority owner. the exact language is designate one principal owner. The team is free to designate the principal owner. That principal owner must meet a lot of USSF financial requirements but none is being a majority owner.gtthere needs to be ONE PRINCIPLE OWNER who owns a controlling share of the team. Actually it is spelled out in the document and they do not need to own a controlling interest although in most larger held companies  would also be a controlling share of the team in closely held corporations it might not be. Look at Ft Lauderdale they have  owners with estimated stake  and a th with a smaller stake estimated at  it would be pretty easy for the controlling interest the three owners with under  but combined have over  to overrule the principle owner. Its pretty unlikely to happen on something big for fear that the principal owner would no longer help them maintain the needed involvement of the principal owner. But in most day to day operations and general running of the club as long as they didnt lose his investment why wouldnt he defer to the majority owners?I had mentioned how a trust could do it. Form a corporation put  million in the corporations bank account getting the corporation well over the  million net worth raise enough additional money for  years of operation and the  bond required. CEO of the corporation the trust could be the designated principal owner. The USSF guidelines say the principal owner needs an individual net worth of at least  million for D  for D if I recall.  I think a good legal challenge to the individual net worth could be made in that case if not a legal challenge at least a good case for changing how the USSF allows principal owners.Following US soccer for so long the reason for the rules for the pro leagues is pretty basic they lose gobs and gobs of money they need to be owned by someone who can afford to lose money for many many years.Supporter majority owned is possible just not feasible.,NASLSoccer,d2yktw6,1,t5_2tjhu

Perhaps this one club spending so much on transfers and salaries for journeymen will help to refocus the rest of the league on other mechanisms for growth and player acquisition and development which in the longterm will help the league. ,NASLSoccer,d539vot,5,t5_2tjhu

Pretty much all of the best supported teams in the lower levels have either vaguely or explicitly stated intentions of going for MLS Sacramento San Antonio St. Louis Cincinnati Minnesota Tampa Bay and Carolina. Imagine how the level of fanmediacorporate support in every town with a pro club could change if they all had a real chance to move up?    So a few poorly run teams might go down a level and millionbillionaires could lose out on some money. Boo friggin hoo.
