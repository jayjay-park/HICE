960357,0,t1_chdg8tx,Oops I read across the wrong row. Four level  archers would be  dps and  HP. So the wizard is definitely better.,CoCRedditCerberus,chdg9lo,1,t5_31ozt
964282,0,t1_chdg8tx,I think the spash makes all the difference... most people take out CC troops using archers and barbs which do single target damage but are very susceptible to spash damage from wiz. and if they dont handle them explicitly wiz are way more dangerous because your pile of giants will get Fd up hard by a pile of wizards.EDIT this is also why I think dragons are great  they do splash damage and can only be targeted by archers they have a lot of singletarget HP and if you dont address them they will F up your attacking army hard.,CoCRedditCerberus,chdwc73,1,t5_31ozt
