1765973,0,t3_1zejeu,Ive transcribed a bunch of Mingus Big Band charts and its always a challenge. The Transcribe software definitely helps but its only a means to an end.    The way I approach it is to map out the form transcribe the lead line  melody of each section of the tune then any low range instruments bari sax bass trombone double bass then fill in any other instruments that stick out usually alto sax trumpet parts lead trombone. Then using that information and my ears try to figure out the chords. Then the drum part primarily the hits he or she is playing.After that its basically a guessing game using my arranging knowledge. Its never going to be perfect but it can get pretty close or at least I like to think so. Best of luck!  I know this thread was submitted five months ago but if youve made progress on your selected chart Id love to see it ,JazzTranscription,ck1r9f1,2,t5_3014v
7813506,0,t3_4matos,I would recommend getting a program called Transcribe you can do a whole lot of things like slow it down put in beat markers to help you figure out the rhythm and analyse the sound wave to figure out the note. Also the only way to get good at transcribing is to do a lot of it you definitely get better the more you do. Figure out what key the song is in first and then when trying to figure out the notes use the notes in the key though there will be notes outside the key that are played. A lot of figuring out the notes is guesswork. Play a note and if its too high come down too low go up and keep trying till you find the right notes. ,JazzTranscription,d3uaw8s,3,t5_3014v
