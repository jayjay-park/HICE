Yes it tells the big surprise on the inside of the jacket cover  but since I am posting this review before release date I dont feel comfortable talking about it. So Im not going to talk a lot about the plot. But I will tell you this.I read this series for two reasons. One I adore Mercy and Adam. Both separate and together. Mercy is such a strong levelheaded heroine who can claim her independence while surrounded by pack vampires etc yet she is so polite and warm. And Adam  well  he fulfills all my dirty needs when it comes to an alpha male. In River Marked we get a lot of Adam and Mercy. And by that I mean almost the entire book is the two of them together. I was shocked and I loved every second of it. We get a very intimate glimpse into their relationship. We see another side of Adam and wow. What a sweetie. I love him even more.No maam he drawled mildly though I could see a dimple peeping out. I loved his dimple  and I loved it even more when he dropped into the accent of his youth. I especially loved the warm strength of him against me. I was so easy.We also learn a lot about what Mercy is. Her heritage is presented in much detail. At times I found these parts to be very slow. There is a point towards the middle that the pacing slows down so much I got worried for the rest of the book. But then something big happens and the rest finished quite nicely.The second reason I read this series is for the amazing intricacies of pack life Patricia Briggs has created. I love her wolves and their politics. How they live so closely as pack yet are always on the verge of violence. I adore their dynamics and how Mercy has come to fit in. But  we dont get that in this book. Adam and Mercy are removed from pack or as much as they can be in this one. I miss that. I know I sound greedy because we do get awesome Adam and Mercy stuff but I will be looking forward getting back to pack life hopefully in the next one.Overall I enjoyed this book. Like I said we see a side of Adam that made me smile. Dont worry he totally loses it a few times and his alpha growly wolf takes over. But it is a very romantic quieter side we see.He smiled at me. Go to sleep. I waited three seconds. Are we there yet? His smile widened and the last of the usual tension melted from his face. For a smile like that Id.do anything.The mystery and conflict are interwoven into Mercys ancestry and I think this look at who Mercy is and where she comes from really makes you understand Mercy better.This book is definitely one of the more romance oriented books in the series. While I dont think a sex scene in every book is necessary for this series I do think this book really could have benefited from at least one. You can think me shallow for saying that  but once you read this book you might understand why I say that.Patricia Briggs continues to write one of the best written urban fantasy series out there. If you dont read this series pick up Moon Called immediately. You will not be disappointed.Rating Bgt .gt .gt .gt . gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt BOOK.... DOWNLOAD.. Remarkable..
