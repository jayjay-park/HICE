341335,0,t3_1y00hh,Im not entirely sure what it is youre describing. Do you see clip indicators on the track the sample is on? Or are you hearing a glitch during playback? What plugin are you using to automate the pitchbend? Is it a dedicated pitch shifting plugin?If its a track clip you can just go into the sample editor and use the gain function under factory I think but I may be mistaken and just bring it down until it doesnt clip any more.It may also be that youre hearing latency issues. If thats the case you may want to increase your buffer size.Sorry for the vague answers it would definitely help if you posted an example of the audio more details about the plugin being used and maybe some screenshots or something.,Logic_Studio,cfg5dnz,3,t5_2rwd9

Some people hate it some people love it the rest of us look at it as a tool which it is. The bonus is that it also has an EQ that lets you solo bands.Which brings me to that request you can also use the Multipressor to solo bands for effects if thats what you want it for. If youre trying to solo bands while youre EQing ... eh Ive never really found it all that useful.There isnt any good builtin saturation really but you can always use Tape Delay as a saturator set the delay time to ms use the Feedback slider to adjust the saturation and the WetDry sliders to adjust the balance.,Logic_Studio,cjq3v9o,4,t5_2rwd9

4857756,0,t1_cu6ul8f,. Synthesise the sub for a kick drum keeping headroom.. Adjoin this sub to an attack sample by aligning in arrange view max zoom ensuring fades on the beginnings and ends of the audio files where appropriate. Sometimes this requires me to invert either the sub waveform or the attack waveform to ensure one generally aligns with the other. Bounce to one file. Yes this step could potentially introduce distortion where one audio files waveform suddenly flows into the others waveform ... but I never seem to hear anything.. Potentially use a low cut on the bounce to remove excessive low frequency rumble.. Potentially silence and use fades to remove any pre or postringing introduced into the kick sample by the EQ.. Potentially adjust the level of the attack in relation to the subfrequency tail after the EQ.. Potentially apply some gentle fading to the tail to shape the tail as sounds best.Sometimes steps are repeated as I mess around. I realise that I should achieve my final goal in the least stepsleast destructive way possible yet I still tend to hear subtle distortion even if that distortion can only be heard using innerear earphones.EDIT Ive just tried to replicate this for the first time in a while and dont seem to find what I describe ... ignore for now Another Logic oddity synthesise a sound ... now normalise the silence and note the random blips of distortion that seem to appear sometimes preceding the synthesised sound sometimes following the sound.

7248297,0,t3_4ejzy5,Im not sure how this was optimised in Logic Pro X but for  there certainly was a consideration to using extra channels and it was positive because of the way the program handled multithreading. If you had a plugin and multiple effects on the same channel it would all be calculated on the same thread meaning stacking plugins would lead to CPU issues this could be avoided by simply routing the channel output to another channel and distributing the plugins over the two. Likewise with multi output plugins like kontakt it was better CPU wise to have multiple instances of kontakt rather than a single kontakt with several instruments routed to different outputs.So uh with that in mind I doubt having more channels would really add that much more resources. ,Logic_Studio,d222w1o,2,t5_2rwd9

Depending what type of work you are doing sometimes you spend more time audio editing sometimes more MIDI editing and you find yourself using a command over and over again on a specific Project.

The book introduces all the basic features that gets you started in Logic.The second book Logic Pro X  The Details  pages covers all the remaining features like Automation Flex Control Surface Advanced Editing Workflow etc....The other two books Logic Pro X  Tips Tricks Secrets  and Logic Pro X  Tips Tricks Secrets  are supplemental books.

9646945,0,t1_da23n6e,Its not necessarily a gripe with Logic definitely happens across all DAWs. Finding the same category of controls across each plugin in the same area for example. Kind of how all iPhone apps have the back forward pull down to refresh etc  in the same spot no matter which app youre using. Also I understand and can sometimes appreciate the stylish UI design some plugins use. It feels cool but from a function standpoint I often feel lost when first trying a new plugin. I dont try new software that often and eventually I always get used to it but it takes a while. Whereas in an iPhone app to use this example again even a new app feels somehow familiar. ,Logic_Studio,da26pfk,1,t5_2rwd9

9731558,0,t1_dacm7tx,Nope not at all sorry for the lack of clarity Im pretty sleepy right now. I have a saved patch that has multiple different samples for example i have a snares patch that has like  different .wavs of different snares. I also have one for kicks vocals bass etc. I do this so that when Im searching for where to go next in a song I can just try out different samples to see which fits.But when I come across say a bass that I want to use in the track i want to be able to construct melodies with it so I would like to have that specific sample in multiple pitches. Is there a way to do this without having to create a new patch altogether? or is that my best bet? I just have tons of oneoff patches as a result of this so I was wondering if there was a way to prevent it.,Logic_Studio,dacmkun,1,t5_2rwd9

10685488,0,t3_5srlcz,So in my experience this is actually fairly difficult to do on Logic alone without thirdparty DJ software.  However there are some workarounds.  I would choose which of the following methods I want to use based on the material and my goal.   The easiest thing to do is just simulate a record slowdown.  Bounce out whatever section you want to effect load it into a sampler and tweak a pitch envelope LFO or even just the pitchwheel until you like what you hear.   As a quick predrop fill I have always liked the sound of a DJ scratching over a kick drum to get that smooth thumpahthumpah.  This is easy to do.  I usually just take a kick either the one I am using in the song or a different one and work with it in audio.  Make a copy and reverse it and the place the normal and reversed kicks by hand so that you get the desired effect.  Then by ear Ill play around with volume automation and region pitch fades in order to make it sound more realistic. With a little work you can get this sounding essentially indistinguishable from a DJ doing it in realtime.  I use this all the time. The hardest thing to emulate is a turntablismstyle scratch solo.  I think you might have a tough time making this sound authentic without some dedicated software.  However a combination of region pitch fades and your EXS or other samplerofchoice could theoretically get you there.Just remember what a scratch actually is its a record moving and therefore sound playing at a manually controlled speedpitch and in a manually controlled direction and with a manually controlled volume.  Thats all.  So for any effect you want just ask yourself what direction would the DJ be scratching in is the sound going forward or in reverse? and how fast would the DJ be scratching the record is the sound playing at original tempopitch slower faster speeding up or slowing down? and of course what if anything would the DJ be doing with the crossfadervolume during this scratch?  All of those things can be emulated with nothing but audio regions and a sampler  but as I said longer more complicated scratch jams might take a prohibitive amount of fiddling if you want it to sound authentic.  ,Logic_Studio,ddi4loz,2,t5_2rwd9
