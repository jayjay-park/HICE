WONT GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!I think its important to have more indepth reviews. Take time to talk about the encounters you had with support if they passed you around or went straight to the issue. Ask if they monitor their own uptime. If so ask to provide a link.If you are using a star rating system make sure you have a decent amount of categories.

From the OPs original post it sounded like he was not much of a technical user. From further comments it sounds like hed be fine. So sure if he is familiar with DebianUbuntu go with that and set something up.gt Youre also going to have to get a decent sized machine in order for everything to run smoothly which might cost a bit.gtConsidering hes not said what hell be running beyond email which is hardly a heavy task a WP blog and a forum neither of which get used much how can you say that?By making the incorrect assumption that he would want cPanel which is resource intensive. gtChrist you could get a whole dedicated server for that albeit without a paid control panel. Youd get a pretty beastly VPS as well. Strange that you quote roughly month when your cheapest Directadmin VPS is . Per Month...Yeah I used our pricing as a base line because thats what Im familiar with. Nothing wrong with that. Lets look at Ramnode wo promotion MB CVZE wcPanel will be about month.

There are a ton of super cheap if money is an issue shared hosting services out there that will deliver significantly faster Wordpress hosting.

For control panels I actually prefer the old school http way because it is a clear indicator that the page amp settings were in fact updated as they should whereas if Ajax fails theres often not an explicit indication. Due to the prevalence of that lack of explicit indication Im left to always wonder whether an Ajax interface is actually doing what I told it to on every site.,webhosting,cg07lyv,1,t5_2qn3h

The other theme for users who really do want full control over their cPanel account.Interesting thought is interestingAs far as the simple interface goes I actually got laughed at when I suggested to my team that we should head in the direction of icloud.coms index page  big very clickable icons with a minimum of accoutrements around it.

557550,0,t1_cg3n4nw,Yep Im from iWF. In terms of comparing us to companies that have unmetered plans... The philosophy we have is that there really is no such thing as unlimited disk space. Each harddrive has a set physical limit. To essentially say you can store the world with us for mo is unrealistic and in my humble opinion should be considered false advertising as once again the harddrive has a set physical limit.In terms of price increases we realize that many people will purchase the basic plan and not use all the resources allocated to that plan. If you do great  good for you. Thats fantastic. That means your site is popular. But the truth of the matter is that  of people wont. If you decide on purchasing a larger plan you most likely know youre going to use more resources than will be allocated to starter plan so it makes sense for us to charge more as we know you will truly be utilizing that space. That being said I did not come up with our rates. In terms of accountsserver youll find we have a pretty dang low number of accounts per server.,webhosting,cg3ner8,1,t5_2qn3h

Edit If your ISP gives you a public IP on your home connection AND allows inbound port  connections not all do  then you should be able to do this from your home network.

In my opinion others might disagree youre currently paying way too much Digital Ocean for example charges way less then that for a product that is practically the same. Either way I would recommend moving off VPS considering your current traffic figures and the expectation to spike with the release of MoP coming up even though a VPS should be able to keep on going for a while I would personally always go dedicated if I could.Information offered above is a bit minimal so if possible try to keep track of the figures yourself as well directly on the box with some software there are multiple solutions possible for this. Id recommend a cheaper unmanaged dedicated server if you can run as in manage your current VPS without much trouble. A dedicated server in terms of useage isnt that much different. Ive PMd you if you need some help or a managed solution. I would gladly help out for free with advise or choosing between options remember watching some videos and guides way back when I still played. .,webhosting,ci84jhx,2,t5_2qn3h

1405778,0,t1_cisbvzr,Just my two cents. Years ago we had similar issues with our shared hosting provider and switched to a cloud host which was in all aspect a true cloud as far as that can mean. Redundant power ISP lines servers storages etc. All servers were vps equivalents but called Cloud serversStill got a recorded  outages that year. Tried a seperate provider and although a bit better still same weird downtimes  even once they almost lost the server data.Been on dedicated servers since then and have not experience any downtime and performance is much better. I pay slightly less then those cloud servers.Cloud seems to be the new term some are using to sell what VPS has always done.

Just across the road is Bobs Diner but since youve never heard of them you go to Dennys instead when the food would have been much better right across the road.,webhosting,cq8f79j,1,t5_2qn3h

So be careful while performing the redesign split trough both companies so that avoid any disaster. Goods news is that it wont affect the SEO rankings at all if done correctly.If youre familiar with DNS changes you likely know that it can take generally up to  hours for servers across the web to understand that the domain is pointing to a different IP address. The best is to test that your site is working properly at NameCheap before you go live and switch the DNS. Given that when working on business projects of us we use a rule of thumb to leave the old sites on the old IP addresses as the shift occurs for a period of about two weeks.

5866017,0,t1_cxoco4i,Replication and failover to DR siteIve got another spin on this. HA setups would price most shared hosting customers out of the market. Ive found great success by taking an enormous fully hotswapable server CPU memory redundant power supplies and partitioning these into smaller logical shared hosting servers using kvm and VTdSRIOV. Im talking  GB of RAM minimum. Use the memory balloon driver to dynamically pull memory from the hypervisor when theres pressure to begin swapping. Once a server swaps to disk everything goes to hell and its only a matter of time before the OOM killer is invoked. Which by the by its a good idea to adjust the OOM score on HTTP processes upward to get reclaimed first in OOM scenarios.Hardware is cheap today but theres no need to stuff more and more sites on a single server. Split it up into smaller logical servers. kvm can achieve  baremetal speed when done right. If a server needs to reboot by a watchdog timeout then through virtualization we can bypass BIOS initialization with hardware RAIDOOB management youre shaving minutes off initialization. Ive been able to reboot a production server with over  accounts domains in under  seconds through systemd. Responsive as in MySQL  Apache running with zero issues. Back to memory balloons split a server ways. Lets say a server is split ways each VM has  accounts. Apache configuration runs leaner than if all  accounts merged hopelessly in one monolithic config. Consequently each individual Apachenginxwhatever process runs leaner. Processes spinup and spindown faster. Monit restarts Apache faster if theres an issue. Service is back up and running in a blink. Now lets use basic probability. Each server is assigned  GB RAM.  are in perfect harmony at  utilization. They can donate  GB RAM a piece   GB from Hypervisor. The probability of  site in  accounts getting on the frontpage is . Probability of  sites? .. Now things get murky thinking back to probability probability of  sites on the same server? . Someone correct me if that calculation is wrong probability wasnt my strong suit in stat. Importantly each VM is populated with a finite capacity in mind X package  Y package  Z package  on the server. Its not overloaded which is why unlimited is such a crap spec. In the event of extraordinary circumstances other VMs on the server can serve as donors to mitigate traffic surges. Once that surge abates RAM is deallocated back to its donors.Snapshot the data on a single hosting accountbtrfs and zfs are the only filesystems that can do this on a directory level rather than blocklevel AFAIK. zfs is out due to licensing conflicts. Ports are a PITA to stay on top of with a publicfacing server. lvm operates only on the block. That leaves btrfs. Its a really good idea when btrfs gets where it needs to be i.e. can I go to sleep knowing I have nothing to worry about. If the PDU catastrophically fails and downs a cabinet  this has happened before  do I have anything to worry about? Even if something did go wrong whats the recovery chance? Ill be honest I love ext. Its demonstrated impeccable reliability over the last  years? btrfs is very promising but mainstream adoption will take some time. When it comes to file integrity I dont believe in early adoption.I recommend using something like Bacula that runs in the background and takes care of differentialincremental backups. If youre looking to get a collection of files immediately tar can stream onthewire to the browser. Just send that pipe and itll complete without corruption.

Yes mail can go on the same server as your web server although it may be preferable to use a separate server so the services can run independently without effecting each other  thats the beauty of having virtual servers. It all just depends how serious this email is for you. If youre using this for important email i.e. your main email address and youve not managed a server before I would consider just concentrating on running the web server for now and host your email with an email hosting provider. Id recommend FastMail for a dedicated bringyourown domain email provider.You will need to change your DNS this involves adding MX entries to point to the server which handles your email  this just tells other email servers where email should be delivered for your domain to your email server. Youll also be adding DKIM and SPF entries to your DNS zone which help with email delivery.Most people setting up a VPS for a website wont deal with auxiliary services such as email or DNS these will normally be offloaded for convenience. Instead the VPS is usually used for website services only HTTP MySQL Redis etc. Its entirely a personal choice though and plenty of mail servers are hosted on the same server as web services especially in shared hosting.All the best with your website!

If the traffic is large enough it will max the ports of the rack switches and not allow any traffic in  If the attack is large enough it can take down a whole datacenter.  There are ways to protect against DDoS and that would be either at the datacenter level or cabinet level or perhaps a dedicated firewall for the vps master.  It is best to have DDoS protection at the datacenter level as otherwise a DDoS else where in the datacenter can take down the whole network.

Theyre technical idiots that only a technical idiot would pay.They also came out strongly in support of SOPA when everyone with a clue was shutting their billion businesses down in protest and only changed their stance when forced to do so and with great reluctance.They also have a terrible ethical history that anyone in legitimate business ought to know better than to associate with. If the car a real estate agent drove made their clients ask you mean the smutty super bowl commercial company? theyd get a new lease pronto.Finally as a professional who bills by the hour GoDaddy costs my clients more than any other company when we come across them because dealing with their shit takes x longer than anybody else and is never industrystandard.

Just for personal knowledge or do you want to make money with web dev? Regardless if you want to get into WP coding I would recommend going through codecademy and learning intro php. After you have base knowledge of php its relatively easy to start hacking up some wordpress with heavy use of free tutorials and youtube vids online. You dont need a server to do the codecademy stuff but pretty much any provider can run a simple WP blog. Digitalocean has a premade LEMP stack that would get you running almost immediately. However if you want to pay nothing just set up some web tech on your home computer and youll learn a little system admin while youre doing it.

For the network part its all about two things   Having enough bandwith to download the page gbps is plenty   Being the closest possible  gt Do you any recommendation on good server  No.  You need to find out where to host on your own.  Like I mentioned before you need to be the closest to their servers.  My preferred hosts are unlikely to be in the same datacenter or even state.  gt and proxy?  Adding in a proxy decreases the bandwith and latency.  Now your proxy has to be as close to their servers as possible with the most bandwith possible and you need to be closest to that proxy.

Each update would result in a a change in the code and the time the new code takes to run cannot possibly be compared to the time the old code took.Then there is the web server. What if initially the server had few clients but as the host piled them on the server starts to slow down? How could you possibly rule that out? It could be that if you bought a new account with the same host it would be on a relatively empty server. Or not. There is no way to know.Software updates to the server software could also change things. Say a jump from php . to php. That would improve performance significantly.,webhosting,d8vj2jl,2,t5_2qn3h
9630333,0,t1_da02kgs,While I usually agree I think the conversation needs to be bigger than Is it the best option?. Ive worked with a number of smaller companies and Cloudflare has been a great asset for them. Yes it is far from a perfect product and it does introduce potential security issues but  overall  I think its a pretty great service. It may be possible to do all of these things with other vendors but I think there is value with putting them all under one roof.I agree that it wouldnt be a great solution for a bank but I think security is about risk management not risk abatement. For example I believe the vast majority of MITM attacks happen on the userside on the network. The flexiblessl option offered does solve that almost entirely and doesnt affect the possibility of risk on the other end using CF doesnt increase or decrease the risk of an upstream MITM with the obvious exception of CF itself. Even using a selfsigned certificate would be good enough in this case since Identify verification is provided by the public CF certificate.A lot of the issues in the article are fairly easily mitigated. For example the assets could be served from cdn.yourdomain.com which is CFprotected and your root domain is not CFprotected if security is a big deal.Also from a practical perspective CF is much better at security than I am. I use CF for the same reason I use a hosting company theyre better at their job than I am. CF is industrystandard really whether thats a good thing or a bad thing.As an aside I have heard of reports of Cloudflare doing a lot of spectacular things during an attack. Surely everyone will have their own opinion on this so Ill consider it a wash right now.My point is its easy to say there are issues with this but really in my mind its far better than doing nothing. Im not a tinhat wearing person that believes the government is going to intercept and log all traffic that goes through CF. If this is important to someone then I agree its possible but I think the NSA has far more important things to deal with.If someone is interested in trying it then I support it. The people who have an issue with the concept of how a reverseproxy works when dealing with CCs TINs etc will know who they are. If you dont then youre probably fine. Let CF handle some of this for you since removing CF just means those things dont happen.,webhosting,da04x7m,2,t5_2qn3h
