Even with the season hes having I think plenty of GMs look at Pedro and see a rare talent who needs a change of scenery to come into his own.  Im willing to bet Pedros inability to throw to first disappears as soon as hes wearing another teams uniform.  Yeah his value would absolutely be higher if his season was going well I dont think his value is so low as to rule out the realistic possibility of a trade however.  What makes things complicated is that Pirates dont want cash for Pedro.  They wants prospects.  I think Pedro and the Yankees are a match made in heaven but Im not sure what the Yankees have to offer in terms of prospects.

1648939,0,t1_cjmsn8j,Thats all fine and dandy but when Martin leaves for an affordable and way less than  of the money  million per year and the Pirates finish next year with  wins or less you may think differently.  Also breaking the draft cost the Pirates around  million if I recall correctly.  Its not like they broke the bank to break the draft.  Obviously a small market team has to find ways to win that dont cost them a  million payroll but dont sit there and act like the draft is complete justification for what theyre doing.  Even if it was its moot now because they cant do it anymore. The point or narrative as you put it that Im going after is that teams that are serious about winning keep the pieces that are most important to them winning.   As others have said Martin is the glue holding this team together.   You lose that and you start to lose its that simple.  Beyond that the Pirates front office makes stupid moves because of money.  The reason they didnt extend the QO to Burnett?  He might have accepted it and  is just too much for them to pay anyone.  Never mind that the worst case scenario was him leaving and getting a first round pick out of it.  It was too big of a risk given the price for them which hindsight has proven to be a pretty bad move especially since he likely would have went to Philly anyways with that offer.  Oh and Beane?  He just mortgaged the teams future to go for it right now.  Hes crafty but he wants to win first and foremost and he has proven that repeatedly.  The Pirates have not yet. ,buccos,cjn0g5l,6,t5_2rr01

4779098,0,t1_ctwtyw1,gt We love seeing the long shots hit the river and basically agreed that there would be more of them if the river were accessible to power right handersThe rarity of river balls makes them even more special. Also fans obviously want to catch home run balls so it would suck if most of them went out of the park. I think they have a good balance especially considering PNC Park is already one of the tougher home run parks. Surprisingly its almost in the top  this year despite being in or around the bottom  in almost every other year. ,buccos,ctwy2x7,3,t5_2rr01

4865118,0,t3_3hdu4x,Thats how the  Pirates were. Im not sure who it was but one the Pirates from that team said that they didnt even care when their opponent scored a bunch of early runs to take a comfortable lead because they knew the team would outscore them by the end of the game. It was almost like they purposely spotted the opponent some runs just to make it more fun. It was on the Fox Sports documentary they did on the  team with many interviews from that  teams players. I want to say it was Dave Parker who said that but Im probably wrong.There was a playerI wish I could remember who who following the Pirates incredible comeback wins against the Cardinals right before the break said that this team just becomes determined to win and when the Pirates were still trailing in those games the Cardinals would bring in a new pitcher in this case their closer Shane Rosenthal and the Buccos would look at each other and say something like Poor guy this aint gonna go well for him.

Some names better than Walker last year Cano Gordon Zobrist Phillips Altuve Russell Lemahieu Kipnis Dozier Kinsler Forsythe.

The one metric thats better than what he is shown is xFIP which has him at . so thats the best thing I can say that in a perfect world he wouldnt be a disaster he would just be really bad.
