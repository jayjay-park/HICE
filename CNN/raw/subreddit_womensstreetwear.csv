7935476,0,t1_d47ia4x,Piggybacking on this to agree with you. Something about showing your bellybutton kind of just screams trashy to me but thats just like my opinion man. As with dresses skirts and other scant items I think you kind of have to choose a thing to display. With crop tops and especially fitted ones I think you need to cover that belly button unless youre wearing looser bottoms and even then ehh... but the lowrise skinnies are just too much. Alternatives are a looser boxier longer crop top but I still wouldnt pair them with anything low or mediumrise.Edit Relax. As I said this is just my opinion. ,womensstreetwear,d480tcb,9,t5_3ec0o

For example this is a community for womenor men to post their own clothes and style or to post inspirations for clothing and style. There are plenty of other fetish and smut subs where your post would fit. Its unfortunatly not this one. ,womensstreetwear,dbosf2u,1,t5_3ec0o
10212111,0,t1_dc1kj1o,Ive had pretty decent luck with amazon actually. Their returns policy is pretty awesome most of the time so if you get something meh or defective you can send it back usually free of charge.A couple of my favorite tees and my favorite dress are from Amazon.
