10173,0,t3_1u8ex9,First dont turn your head while lifting.  Next when locking out you need to drive your hips through and pull your shoulders back.  You arent locked out in the video you posted. You should be squeezing your ass hard and locking out by squeezing your glutes and not your lower back and if youre doing it right you may even get a little bruising where the bar is hitting your hips.  Also I would reset with each rep your first rep looks much different than subsequent reps.  This will help you work on form and strength off the floor.  Furthermore I would get your hips a little lower at the start to get some leg drive but dont think of the deadlift as a leg exercise.  You should not and I repeat not be squatting the weight with a deadlift.  You want to push your ass back and chest up creating tension on the bar and then think about pulling back and pushing your feet through the floor once the bar is at knee level squeeze your glutes hard mad drive your hips through.  Then to lower the bar just unlock your hips and come down with the bar dont try and resist the weight just let it come down.  Finally you dont need to use a belt especially not as a crutch.  Lets your abs and back become strong enough to be a natural belt.,bodyweightfitness,cefld7c,2,t5_2tf0a

24562,0,t3_1uedbc,Seems like you just want a quick workout dedicated to making your abs look better. If so the routine you posted is pretty meh and assuming you can already do the  sit ups easy wont get you much closer to that goal.I think a better way to hit that goal would be cardio dieting and some ab workouts maybe  like planks leg lifts lsits etc. Situps arent well recommended because they can damage your spine among other things. You can do the cardio however you like martial arts jump rope running and add pullups or anything else you like. Altogether I think that would be  min of ab work and however long you want of anything elseBest way would be to doa  full body routine of some sort like suggested in the faq. That would build your whole body and eventually lead to new ways to workout your abs and other body parts lever planches etc,bodyweightfitness,ceh89ed,1,t5_2tf0a

78579,0,t3_1uzi55,So youre getting  pull ups every time... So instead try x... And then wait as long as you need to fully recover  minutes and bust out another set. You could even go for a th set... but you may not have much left in you.. so you could do a set of purely eccentric pull ups. Fair warning eccentrics often create soreness. This may help real through the plateau but dont go ape shit with increasing the volume too fast so you dont develop elbow tendonitis specifically medial epicondylitis associated with excessive pulling.Considering its January... And you said everythings progressed in the last  months except pull ups and pull ups are weight sensitive Im going to assume you gained some weight if youre in the northern hemisphere cause people tend to gain some weight during the colder months.

You could use a backpack too but I found that once it got up to about  pound it was kind of tough to keep balance with it. A dip belt is best and a dumbbell will do.Once it got harder and harder for me to progress with hitting x I switched to x.

771942,0,t3_22zsxt,My first guess would be that prison food might not actually be unhealthy but rather simply taste and look shitty while having the basic amount of nutrition.However a look at the Wikipedia page it seems that prison food is actually problematic. gtThere is concern that food preparation practices are changing. Recently there have been numerous documented examples of mass illness within prisons from the food served. There have been hunger strikes from prisoners protesting being served food that makes them ill after eating. .gtWhistle blowers and reporters have documented mice droppings and various violations of standards in prison kitchens. .gtThere is .. usually no way for inmates to ever have access to fresh food.This kind of food is what I thought to be more widespread in prisonsgtNutraloaf sometimes called prison loaf disciplinary loaf food loaf confinement loaf seg loaf or special management meal is a food served in United States prisons to inmates who have demonstrated significant behavioral issues... Prison loaf is usually bland perhaps even unpleasant but prison wardens argue that nutraloaf provides enough nutrition to keep prisoners healthy..gtIt was mentioned by the U.S. Supreme Court in  in Hutto v. Finney while ruling that conditions in the Arkansas penal system constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Prisoners were fed grue described as a substance created by mashing meat potatoes oleo syrup vegetables eggs and seasoning into a paste and baking the mixture in a pan. A victory for the constitution of the US prisoners are allowed to be abused despite the law! sgtLawsuits regarding nutraloaf have taken place in several states including Illinois Maryland Nebraska New York Pennsylvania Washington and West Virginia. In March  prisoners brought their case before the Vermont Supreme Court arguing that since Vermont state law does not allow food to be used as punishment nutraloaf must be removed from the menu. In April  sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County Arizona won a federal judgment in favor of the constitutionality of nutraloaf,bodyweightfitness,cgs0vm3,1,t5_2tf0a
773674,0,t1_cgryzb9,Yep! Those are them though this video is probably not the best guide for proper form. heres the hollow body This isnt a static hold dont bother doing rocks shown in the video yet wait for those until youre up to s sets then move up to this but notice how smooth the rocking motion is. Absolutely no arch in the lower back and one continuous surface you can smoothly rock with. Get in the position and maybe do a test rock or two at first while youre finding your proper position. If you cant hold the position and smoothly rock like that then you need to make the position easier until you can hold your pelvis in the right position. moving arms down straddling legs or even tucking the legs until the thighs are perpendicular to the floor are all ways to make this easier. This is how Ive heard arch recommended this style is going to be much more difficult on your shoulders and will help with handstandbridge prep. The most important thing with arch hold is to focus on headshoulders going towards one wall and glutesthighs going towards the other. Youre working to lengthen your lower back not compress it... so that feeling of lengthening will be what youre going for. Again youll want to be able to smoothly rock eventually in this one too once you can hold s per set. Its going to take a lot of transverse abdominal strength though until youll be able to breathe in that position much less hold your front solid enough to smoothly rock on. And yeah  sets after Lsit work would be a good place for it. Good luck!,bodyweightfitness,cgs7z3k,1,t5_2tf0a

And then once you have this down you can start doing backtucks with ease!The only issue I have with this tutorial is that by learning to macaco first my back handsprings were all messed up initially as I was either not looking straight back or moving one arm out of sync with the other. Now I have mostly corrected this with some help from a coach but just a word of warning to anyone else.I personally wouldnt say that you can do back tucks straight after learning the back handspring theyre majorly different movements. However it will help to get over the idea of going over straight backwards.If anyone is looking to learn flips or tricks I highly recommend going along to any open sessions at a gymnastic gym nearby or if you have one in your area you can always go to a tricking or parkour gym.

911184,0,t3_24j6mr,Rather than starting with wall assisted straddle negatives you should probably start with tuck down drills. I couldnt find a good video but watch this See the tuck position hes in before and after his handstand hold? If you work up to sets of  handstand down to tuck up to handstand is one before you start straddle press work you should find it to be much easier since youll already have the important parts of the feel down. This move feels really difficult but definitely has a much lower barrier of entry than the actual straddle press. As you get more comfortable with the tuck position you can work moving between tuck straddle and straight and eventually start playing with moving from tuck to single foot forward. You can use wall assisted at first if you need to but if youve already got a s handstand you should be able to start working it in freestanding. Also as part of your conditioning Id suggest you start doing this drill as part of your warm up. At least x. For core Id suggest adding in hollow body holds eventually moving up to hollow body rocks then dragon flag progressions. For your goals thats probably more important than back lever work. Ill second the suggestion to either work on dips or PPPUs to balance out the two pulling exercises. ,bodyweightfitness,ch7uvt1,2,t5_2tf0a

This would be a good form standard to strive for IMO From dead hang pull the bar to your nipples.If you can do x nipple to bar pullups already id say you should try working towards something harder like a one armed pullup if you want greater hypertrophy and strength. You arent effectively training for hypertrophy or strength if youre doing reps a set you need to do something harder to cause gains One armed negatives archer pullups one hand on a towel pullups and weighted pullups are all probably a good next progression for you to work on if you have strength andor a better physique as a goal. ,bodyweightfitness,chfz1c3,20,t5_2tf0a

Back bend  Arch your back and land in a back bend.  This has a bit of added coolness if you can then stand up from the back bend.

1237656,0,t3_288q69,Football training considerably for a reciever using body weight from my experience lbs when I played   D end can help in regards to both  dash and building mass. My prime focus when I trained was to put on muscle mass and not body fat while training for muscular memory a lot of focus should be put on insulating the shoulders from impacts and maintaining your current levels of fitness while adding mass. Though protein combined with exercise does work body weight can be used in conjunction with a lifting program and a mass bulking diet to attain the muscle levels you require for varsity.In regards to muscle memory I strongly suggest that you train your muscles under strain to remember the motions and not the weights. Anyone can do bicep curls with the right weight not everyone can crack a line pull a  yard dash catch a ball push off a tackle and keep going for the TD. Training yourself much like football practice on those motions while under strain give a stronger result without the strain the strain being the weight motion is everything in sports considerably so in football and rugby.  If you need any help trying to figure out what you can do I can give a few pointers down the road if you come upon a road block. ,bodyweightfitness,ci8upep,1,t5_2tf0a

1371880,0,t1_cio8afq,Ahh... All the citations have been absorbed into my brain over the years. Ill dig them up.As for quality Sleep is a pretty fuzzy thing even though we know quite a bit about it. As such quality can vary depending on anything from what you ate to phase of the moon.However more scientifically speaking for deep sleep your brain primarily uses brainwaves of a certain wavelength alpha beta delta etc. This is a good link to explain a lot of that Stages  and  of sleep are almost exactly the same except stage  has more delta waves than stage  both are considered deep sleep. The more time you spend in stage  rather than  the more efficient your deep sleep.Theres also stage  and  which are basically garbage white noise sleep. Its sleep thats so light that people commonly report not even having fallen asleep if theyre woken up from those stages. The less time you spend in those stages the higher your sleep quality. The normal sleep cycle goes Awake gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt REM. You then start at stage  and go back down again. The process takes roughly  minutes although it varies per person.Stages  and  are more or less useless for rest memory repair muscle repair growth hormone secretion etc... If you ever had a night where you tossed and turned the entire time and you feel like shit in the morning its because a lot of your sleep was stages  and . Of the deep sleep stages  is okay but  is higher quality due to its greater concentration of delta waves. REM is pretty much you have it or dont however you can have larger and more uninterrupted chunks of REM and you can have more frequent REM chunks which can increase sleep quality rather than having REM being interrupted by a jump into the st or nd stage due to external factorsSo tldr if quality of sleep were to be defined as a unit it would be something along the lines of unit of restunit of time with the goal of sleep being to go from tired to  rested. The higher quality your sleep the more rested you are in the morning and the less sleep you need.Id also like to point out that I disagree with the REM sleep model as its outdated but thats far beyond the scope of this post and it conveys the same idea anyway. Modern model combines  since theyre the same thing and it thus becomes REM with stages  both being lightgarbage sleepSources for information taking protein late at night greatly increases its effectiveness Highintensity exercise during the nighttime period when melatonin levels already are elevated consistently results in a further nearly  elevation of melatonin levels. Ergo cardio before morning nap gives an optimal hormonal balance especially when its cold out.  Another link for same point above I actually read the information about the memory consolidation on wikipedia first funny enough. Generally declarative memories are enhanced by slowwave sleep while nondeclarative memories are enhanced by rapid eye movement REM sleep although there are some inconsistencies among experimental results. For the amount of sleep thing If youre around the age of  a high average amount of sleep is roughly  minutes of deep sleep with  minutes of REM both numbers can be higher youll simply be above average sleep quality.Aiming for that amount of sleep regardless of age produces optimal health benefits. A perfect night of sleep might have anywhere from  minutes of deep sleep  minutes of REM and only a half hour or less of light sleep if possible. However in the interest of simple numbers I just like to say roughly . hours of dreaming and . of deep sleep per night is a good goal to aim forSorry it took so long to write the post.

1718878,0,t1_cjvt0i0,I think that is a matter of perspective. What he slips into is certainly not the typical super deep false grip. He does an outstanding job of slowly moving the base of the metatarsal and distal wrist bones over the rings from  seconds and you can see at the  second mark the outside of the wrist is definitely on the rings. Not the forearms but you can see the slip into a shallow false grip. Theres no shame in that it doesnt happen until the middle of the transition but theres no other way to get the wrist on top of the rings or bar in order to complete the dip. If you watch the left hand which is closest to the camera  from  seconds you can see the wrist flex while the forearms are not moving. That is when the slip into the false grip happens. It is not immediately obvious because it is very minimal and brief but if you watch this segment a few times you can see it happen. Pausing the video and clicking slowly through this section makes it much more visible.This is not the classic superdeep false grip you usually see but the palm slips into a deeper horizontal position than it starts out in with a flexed wrist. Thats a false grip.I am not sure if it can be done any better than he has done it in that video that is pretty boss. He didnt use the false grip for any part of the upward pull and thats really the best anyone can do. ,bodyweightfitness,cjvtsvh,1,t5_2tf0a

If it started hurting yesterday and just feels sore it could be muscle. If its been hurting for a few extra days than that though none of the other options are particularly good. In my case its a tendon injury from shitty computer ergonomics  too much handstand training. Tendon injuries can mean scaling back on certain work for  weeks or run the risk of getting a more serious chronic problem with the joint. If you have a good person to go see for this stuff it might be worth getting it checked out though... always better to have someone inperson steer you straight.

1802750,0,t3_2f5hj9,gt Hi Im in the final stages of developing an app involving only bodyweight exercises that can be counted in a tabata style time period.Uhh.. You should go back to the beginning stage and get a good routine. Sorry OP this all around sucks for so many reasons... Ill list them for your benefit. High Knees  Why? Thats cardio and a stretch theres way better options for leg exercise Thats cardio bro not bodyweight exercise. Bodyweight exercises are like weight lifting but with your body theyre still centered around pushpull. Solid  But you need to define pushup types and progressions Squats  Same as above progressions are important. Plain bodyweight squats stop doing much until you get to  legged squats and those are challenging Crunches are worthless Burpees are great but still cardio based Switch Kicks  Cardio they dont work the muscle thats just moving and getting your heart rate up Lunges  Are fine but you need progressions and variations. Lunges are more of a stretch than an exercise In and Outs  Those are more like knee raises which are fine but need progressions Ankle tap crunches  Theres better exercises for abs Jump Squats  Are fine. Mountain Climbers  More cardio and stretching based again.. Tricep Dips  Are fine but you need to progress eventually Suicide Jumps  More cardio. Plank Knees to Elbow  Technically since youre moving im not sure that counts as a plank which is a stationary exercise.Its very clear you think cardio  bodyweight exercise. Its very clear you dont have any level of understanding on what bodyweight exercises are or how they work. Im not going to beat around the bush. This is really stupid. And this particular advice is really bad The routine is a pretty challenging exercisetofailure workoutHonest review Read the sidebar here. Read rfitness on how strength training works bodyweight fitness is STILL strength training.,bodyweightfitness,ck6dym6,6,t5_2tf0a
1806407,0,t1_ck68m2k,Yeah just what kayetech said. It isnt a row unless youre getting your elbows behind your body which you simply cant do on a bar. I was asking to make sure the jump in difficulty wasnt due to a massive change in ROM,bodyweightfitness,ck6ubuy,2,t5_2tf0a

1816487,0,t1_ck81iqd,If you dont have access to parallel bars for dips then pike push ups are a great vertical push. Can you hang something from your pull up bar to do rows with? If you cant then assistance bands will be fine for a little while but youll probably outgrow them quickly. Once youre solid with pull ups for an arbitrary number lets say  x  you could start working on a front lever. Once youve opened the tuck you can do advanced tucked front lever rows on a bar but thatll be a little down the road yet.However if you can invest in some rings eventually that would be the best option. The main issue with the split routine you put above was it was a bit thrown together without much focus on why each part was there. There is actually no need to do more than one exercise for each plane of motion for a long while. Once you are considering a split when you have a very solid base of strength and programming for more advanced movements uantranik has put together a very solid split routine hereIm still working on a full body routine which you can see here despite starting to move towards more intermediate skills like flags and levers etc. I will probably have to shift onto a split eventually partially due to time constraints but the full body routine is working really well for now. ,bodyweightfitness,ck82ipv,2,t5_2tf0a

Although this would be the preferred route for most in general anyone looking to get in just better shape could even just do basics like Smith Machine Squats Lunges Goblet Squats that one machine where you push with your legs and can load the sides with weights forgot what it was called.Also with Squats and Deadlifts you run the risk of injury if your perform them without proper form.  Though these can be selftaught and are amazing exercises that tax almost all the muscles in the body ask yourself this do you really care about putting up heavy weights?  Because if its not for athletic reasons then I think you can get away with skipping the big three.  There are plenty of other exercises that do similar to what squats n deadlifts do muscle wise.I know Ill probably get flamed for this but Im pretty sure OP just wants to be in better shape and look better.  Squats and Deadlifts arent always the answer oh yeah and also hes posting in BWF sub as well.  I would recommend improving his upper body pulling and just work on BW squats for the time being.  So my advice to OP keep working on upper body pulling movements there are multiple methods to get better such as GTG Grease the Groove Pavels Pullup Program etc. keep runningjogging mix it up as well by biking or sprinting.,bodyweightfitness,ckdxtlw,-4,t5_2tf0a

1953852,0,t1_ckmlrk8,Gb is heavily moderated now if you are going against the business model or want to do anything thats not strictly in the program design. This changes the tone of the site but its not necessarily bad in all ways.I dont like it because I cannot explain things in a purely scientific manner. In order to get something approved it has to be in line with the GB Way which is not always consistent with human physiology. I caught a lot of flak for simply explaining why a  week cycle is a suggestion and is not really the best way to go about developing a s or  rep skill as prescribed. I explained the physiology and alternative ways to approach the template that dont disregard it but put it into context as a helpful guide rather than The Bible Itself.For that I got heavily censored. Thats one small example. It was impossible to keep up in real time with the community and I was even blocked from congratulating Allan on his performances or complimenting Coach on his work with Allan. In short my voice itself was the subject of very heavy control. That makes things personal not professional but think about this I spoke with the same degree of authority as Coach did. You cant have mixed messages like that. It was simply time for me to move on and so I have.Because Coachs business model is based around being strictly GB and not branching out too far from the core programming or wasting resources adapting programming for other sports or for hybrid goals those discussions are pretty much nonexistent these days. However that does allow a very strict focus on the program itself and how to progress which is a good thing for their model.Again even though I am not personally happy with the way things have changed I recognize why it is considered to be a good change from Coachs perspective. In the end his businesss growth will determine whether or not it was a good idea and I think we will all see GB continue to grow for a long long time so its probably not bad. Just different.Those of us who dont like it are free to do our own thing and start our own schools of instruction complete with more inclusive communities.,bodyweightfitness,ckon4ue,5,t5_2tf0a

I have a few tips from my very limited experience but since it has to do with starting i feel qualified. Most of the exercises on the simple beginner routine you can do without any equipment actually everything but the pulling exercises. And since you are just starting a door jam works great for vertical rows and so until you actually need to progress to incline rows you wont need anything. I recently invested in a pullupdip station since i also didnt have anywhere to do exercises. I had to throw some heavy bags of wheat on the foot supports so it wouldnt topple under my weight but besides that its been working great. Im also counting calories working out  times a week and doing my best to lose my fat. Good luck youre not alone! ,bodyweightfitness,ckxobyl,1,t5_2tf0a

So if you did pullups and then bicep curls or handstand pushups and then tricep extensions those would be good supersets. Supersetting two completely different movements like dips and chins is completely pointless and will only interfere with your recovery and therefore your gains.

More than anything it depends what your goals are so I dont think there is a correct version of doing it.Perhaps youre already strong enough to not notice but the GMB version with straight arms on the legs should be a bunch harder than the one with bent arms and knees resting on the outside. Look at how his knees are essentially in his armpits here when he goes into it. This requires increased flexibility. I think its also harder to hold yourself in the pose with straight arms as you are doing more isometric work in your arms and core to hold your weight up rather than resting the legs on the arms.I personally think the crane pose looks a lot better the way he does it in your video. Its also excellent for practicing crane gt handstand gt crane transition pressing as the arms remain locked out the entire time.,bodyweightfitness,clygoic,2,t5_2tf0a

2345719,0,t3_2m6fr6, Great post!As a PT just starting out I have one or two things to add. Sorry in advance for formating and any weird sentences. Im mostly a lurker and not a native speakerRegarding downward rotation of the scapulaSome of you may have trouble with this movement because of a tight pectoralis minor so massaging or stretching it will help with your ROM in that direction as well as posture and potentially help with thoracic outlet syndrome if you suffer from it.Regarding scapular stabilityYou dont really go into this very much. What often happens especially in beginners is that the scapula can not be held to the thorax sufficiently during loaded movements. This looks somewhat lika a Scapula alata and is caused by a insufficiency of the serratus anterior and the rhomboideus muscles. Fixing this on your own can be challenging since it may be hard to feel if the scapula is aligned to the thorax or winging. To start with it would be a good exercise to do a plank against the wall and imagine that the scapula is  held to your ribcage by a suction cup. Then shift your weight from one arm to the other while maintaining scapular alignment.Later you can move on to trying to move your upper body while still planking against the wall. This way you will learn to stabilize your scapula in different positions. Stabilizing your scapula while moving your arm is harder than in load bearing exercises so that woul be the next step after that.,bodyweightfitness,cm1n4rw,3,t5_2tf0a

In order for me to maintain that higher number I needed to keep up with the intensity.

The shoulder part is the other more obvious half. edit  Add my comment from a similar question beforeSearch for core work here Fundamentals of Bodyweight Strength TrainingThere is a photo with pike and straddle compressionFor these I would add them to either the end of the workout when you do flexibility work OR you may add them into the beginning where youre working on your LsitstraddleLManna work. Both work well from my experience.Here are some guidelines. Stretch your hamstrings for s. Arms straight hands by your knees.. Pull your knees up to your face straining your abs as hard as possible.. Hold s. If you feel lots of cramping when you first start youre doing it right. Repeat  about  times.If you can get your knees to you face for most of the sets move your hands closer to your toes.  If your hip flexors or psoas andor structures involved in lifting the legs under compression were stronger then you may be able to get the feet off of the ground better while holding the Lsit on your hands. Once the feet are off the ground you can work on getting a stronger push through more accurate Lsit.I hope it helps.

I did the first three classes and I think you will definitely get something out of it but there are better routines. There are a lot of different exercises involved and the progressions are reasonable to a certain extend. I.E. you have pushups pullups handstandpushups rows and legs involved. But there are serious flaws in his programming if your goal is maximizing strength gains. E.g. it basically consists of a PushPullLegsCoreSplit most of the time which is not the best choice for beginners as i have learned and additionally he fucked up the onearmpushupprogression because you are supposed to be able to do onearmpushups after elevated standard pushups which simply is not possible for most of the people. To a lower extend this applies to pullups too since there is not enough volume to get to higher rep ranges in the first three classes. Then there is chief class the last class where you are supposed to do high rep numbers of pullupshandstandpushups and one armpush ups which is not possible at all after completing master class. So without adjusting to these flaws your progress will stall after a few months which is the reason why I would prefer the FAQRoutine or Convict Conditioning or something like that.Additionally he divides each of his routines into endurancestrengthpower and an endulatingblock where you change exercises every week which doesnt seem to be the most effective way to train.,bodyweightfitness,cn6gww4,1,t5_2tf0a

Or a gym membership for weighted squats.Pullups Weighted pullups Lsit pullups work. Or One arm pullup progression but you have to be super careful with that. Tons of tennis elbows there for a lot of people. My favourite progression there would be to hang a towel over your pullup bar and grip that with one hand grip the bar with the other hand and just do pullups that way. To make it easier grip higher on the towel with the assisting hand to make it harder grip lower.Core work I dont really do any specific core work besides the occasional LsitVsit.

2998637,0,t3_2uil0h,I am no fitness expert and simply workout a little each day to feel less stiff since I sit at work all day. Hip thrustsglute bridges can work out your lower body and wont shake your floor. I live in an attic apartment and just walking shakes the floor which is quite unnerving... This will target predominantly your glutes which is a great foundation for further leg work. I still do squats in my apartment but slow and controlled so there isnt any shaking of the floor. You can do several reps or you can hold for as long as you can  sink low ass to the grass! Experiment with keeping your feet at various widths when you squat this will activate different muscles. Yoga stances such as the various warrior poses can really strengthen your legs if you hold them for awhile and sink into them. I like to do my bodyweight stuff for about  minutes twice a day usually before meals just choose whether you want to do it before breakfast lunch or dinner.

3159873,0,t1_coorrlu,Compound movements do have a limiting muscle group but they usually fatigue many muscle groups at once making them much more efficient than isolation exercises for strength. Also compound movements are typically much more taxing on the CNS which has a huge impact on strength. gtbut does it specifically target any muscle? not really. is it worth the time youd put into it in terms of muscle growth and physique enhancement? nope.Defend that. The front lever heavily targets the lats posterior delts and core. In fact lats are typically the limiting muscle group for people training the front lever so yes I would say it definitely does help you build a more impressive physique. gtis it a good way to progress rows to make them work your back harder? no way The front lever row is harder than the one arm row by several orders of magnitude so also yes it does make your back work harder than one arm rows.,bodyweightfitness,copiovf,1,t5_2tf0a

3204551,0,t3_2wu1bc,kind of irrelevant.You might be able to do  pull ups but not be any more prepared than someone who can do  pull ups. If youre looking to do explosive muscle ups which are really just a kipping movement then the power you have at the bottom of the movement in the full hang is literally everything along with being able to do a dip once you get into the dip support.For strict muscle ups what matters is the transition. No amount of pull ups strengthens the transition by themselves... what strengthens the transition is using false grip pull ups with a hold at your maximum height because that lets you start building the ability to actually pull yourself up into the transition zone. Over time these naturally turn into a muscle up as long as you can do a full ROM dip.To work on the dip portion Russian dips are the best way to go. They are partial ROM controlled descents into the transition zone from the dip literally the opposite of the false grip pull up.,bodyweightfitness,cou5g3r,4,t5_2tf0a

Adjust your intake up and down once per week until you know how much energy use each day. At the same time form the habit of daily exercise on rest days do stretching or active recovery or light cardio or something.Once exercise becomes something you just do like brushing your teeth worry about further optimisation via bulking and cutting. On the subject on when you should bulk and cut heres a fairly well researched article.

3473139,0,t1_cpo2v22,There can be multiple reasons for this. In general pain nociception is a sensory perception that is often tied to injury but may or may not be depending on certain circumstances. Phantom limb pain is one type where there is even no limb but the brain still experiences pain. In chronic pain often is the case where you have pain but no actual physical injury the brain is perceiving pain for some reason which doesnt make it any less real from the feedback from the nervous system to the body during movement. Its often tied to the fact that practice makes perfect pain can get set in a feedback loop like that.Generally with more acute injuries its best to think of them as tied together however when things dont add up such as pain present even when there is no injury or lack of physical relief and whatnot youre probably dealing with some of the weirder situations.This is more of an explanation rather than a recommendation. I would suggest Antraniks advice because it focuses on relaxing the nervous system and muscles and may decrease threat andor pain response.However tight muscles are often tight for a reason because there iswas pain or weakness or instability can be any of these or all of them. Thus for particular symptoms such as tight muscles it may be better to do strengthening and stability work rather than soft tissue work and stretching.Foam rolling that doesnt permanently help after about  sessions or so can be thought of as not the answer generally speaking of course.,bodyweightfitness,cpo5vwq,1,t5_2tf0a

I would just say squats because the variation doesnt substantially change muscle recruitment. What it does change is stress on the back and front squats are the least stressful. They also tend to be good in my exerience for people who are not able to perform back squats without leaning over a lot even though they have a perfectly shaped back during their squat.My girlfriend switched to front squats and hasnt looked back since. She likes them a lot more. She happens to have fairly long femurs and fairly short lower legs so shes kind of inherently going to lean forward more than I ever will. I actually prefer front squats too for different reasons that primarily have to do with wanting to learn the Olympic lifts really really well later on in a few years.

I dont think his skin the cat can get much better except for more pike compression and less momentum. You can ignore this comment if youre not concerned with practicing the more final version of this movement.Edit Not trying to nitpick but I think that the terms front lever FL and back lever BL may be used a little loosely in Joshs video. If you are doing the tuck version of the skin the cat then yes you do go through tuckFL and tuckBL. But in the real skin the cat you do not go through FL and BL that is a completely different movement.

3721077,0,t3_330rwn,I do barbell training but I figure the mental aspect is mostly the same as bodyweight fitness especially where motivation and discipline is concerned.When I accomplish something I make sure to take a moment to notice how I feel which is usually along the lines of HOLY censored string of bad words I LIFTED THE more bleep THING!! HELL YEAH!! IM SO redacted AWESOME!!.I take a couple deep breathes Ill probably need them anyway and mentally rewind and replay the lift and congratulate myself. While this may sound silly Ive found that its important to explicitly allow myself to feel good over my progress.When Im having a hard day I just close my eyes and try to remember a few of those moments and replay their lifts. If its a particularly awful day I will do this during the entire warm up phase all the while psyching myself up for the lifts ahead. Ill tell myself things like what if today is the day you break that deadlift PR? You wouldnt want to miss it just because youre lazy right? Imagine how youll feel the rest of the day after crushing your record.Music helps a lot. I always lift to Two Steps From Hell and its become part of my ritual. Often times the awfulness just goes out the window when the music starts and I turn into a Russian power lifting machine on the spot.Talking about rituals its important to have them. Its all about the small things. Solid habits take no effort to execute and turning your workout into a habit can only be a good thing. In a nutshell you want to use your ritual as mental cue for the habit of working out while making sure you focus on the reward such as me making sure I notice how good I feel after a good lift.,bodyweightfitness,cqgfggf,17,t5_2tf0a

Also would I do not think stretching before exercise is that helpful to prevent after workout muscle soreness.

Ignore much of the stuff on the internet about dieting this often applies to people wanting to lose weight or to professional bodybuilders. Bulking up isnt difficult.This may go against what others may reply with but... Honestly Ive been where you are right now and there is no need to follow a strict diet. Just make sure youre getting regular meals and make sure youre eating enough. That means dont skip any meals eat bigger portions than you would normally and finish whats on your plate. Eat a peanut butter sandwich in between meals if you feel at all hungry.As far as foods go...things like eggs chicken peanut butter sandwiches milk cheese beef beans fish tofu ie protein richfatty foods are great dont go massively overboard with the fat obviously. Carbs are also so important for gaining weight brown bread brown rice oatmeal etc. Have fruit and veg too of course.There is absolutely no need to be anal about proportions or to track your calories unless you really feel the need to. Youre not a professional bodybuilder so theres no need to act like one. Just eat as much as you can and that should be enough. Measure you weight  every couple of weeks at the same time of the day and track your progress that way. Once you see your weight increasing youll be inspired to continue.Also start doing light work outs if you arent already maybe  times a week. Stopreduce any cardio that youre doing and find a beginner bodyweight or weightlifting program simple compound exercises like pull ups push ups wall handstand push ups are great and will give you an overall athletic physique that youre looking for. If youre like me then youll find it much easier to put on weight when youre exercising rather than sitting at a computer all day. To put it very very simply  fatigued muscles  repair  muscle growth  weight gain.Edit For reference this is a reasonably good article that came up on google.

4248377,0,t1_cs3wkpg,That info would have been good to know.So Im a really active person except this pregnancy I was just sick as hell.  Since giving birth Ive lost  lbs.  My  prior pregnancies  yrs ago I lost the weight by only watching my diet but I didnt work out much.  This caused me to lose a lot of muscle.  This time  Ive watched everything I eat but Ive worked out a ton because Im getting back in shape for more marathons.  I really didnt start back working out harder until a couple months because of healing and waiting until our sleep schedule was more on track. Before that i just watched my eating and walked.  I started out walking and doing bodyweight fitness stuff like squats and lunges for my legs.  After this pregnancy Ive noticed my lower back and stomach are very weak so Ive concentrated a lot of effort on those.  Planks are great for both.  Watch out for diastasis recti where the ab muscles dont close back up right.  That can take many weeks to sort out.  When looking up stomach info I found a bunch of info on strengthening the transverse abs being really important for core strength rather than just looks.  Im not sure what her end goal is.  For me I needed to get running again.  When I felt up to it and was rested I started doing intervals on my treadmill.  Run  min walk  and increase the running part as I felt ready no walking now.  Then Id bike as well for about an hour those days.  On nonrunning days I did the bodyweight fitness stuff and stomach and back work along with biking.  Sometimes Id take walks at night with friends for an hour.  I had a LOT more weight to take back off than her though so I had to hit that part hard.  Ive worked up to being in pretty good shape  y just increasing my intensity in running and biking and adding weight now to most lifting.  I do all this at least  times per week.   times running per week long and slow tempo and speed work.  Biking each day I work out and weights  times per week.  I walk with friends probably  times per week for an hour as well.  Maybe that gives you an idea of coming back after pregnancy.  This was my third and Im  so she may have an easier time than me!,bodyweightfitness,cs4i6ws,2,t5_2tf0a

The first is called the clove hitch which will be tied around the bar near one end of the rope. Using the long end of the rope you will tie another hitch around the ring namely the taut line hitch. This hitch can be adjusted along the main segment of the rope which will change the distance between the rings and the bar. Make sure this one is taut before each set so it doesnt slip out on you.

4509762,0,t3_3coci1,While there isnt such a thing as a wrong handstand if youre specifically going for a straight handstand feel free to use these pointers. It looks like you are arching your lower back a tiny bit and to compensate you are breaking at the shoulders and hips slightly closed shoulders and piked hips. I dont know if your problem is with lack of active shoulder flexibility or if it is a result of other parts of your handstand not being aligned. Like one other user pointed out elevating the shoulders may help achieve the final little bit of opening you are looking for. Another thing you would need to work on is protracting your shoulders in the handstand. This coupled with PPT will help your handstand be much straighter. Regarding PPT yes hollow holds etc will help but speaking from personal experience they never helped me get a feel for it when inverted. The only way I could fix it was to hold PPT in a handstand against the wall for time. ,bodyweightfitness,csz3r7x,1,t5_2tf0a

4523306,0,t3_3czx6f,I believe the best response in this thread is by uScientologst  the information youve given is insufficient to give adequate advice.Check your pushing vs pulling balance. How many pushups vs pullups can you do and how difficult are the variations? I also figure that pullups  bicep curls are going to make roll your shoulders forward over time even with pullups. To be honest Id switch the bicep curls for horizontal rows even if they are not the reason they still give work to the biceps will help your shoulders by developing the rear delt and works more muscles. If you want to keep the focus on the biceps place your hands in front of the bar when you grip it not behind though behind still works the biceps plenty. If you do bicep curls with one hand at a time it will even take less time. If you really want to do things right check the recommended routine on the right sidebar.Is the pullpush balance more or less even? do you slouch forward? you probably have a weak lower back. Do deadlifts. If you cantdont want to go to a gym or buy equipment do back levers but deadlifts are better by an order of magnitude.Check also if you have abnormal pelvic tilt some anterior pelvic tilt  degrees or less is fine. Youll have to search how do to this yourself but its not difficult or time consuming.Check your form too. If you search this subreddit you might find that you dont even do pushups correctly even if the form is not causing a problem youll reap more benefits and prevent injuries by following correct form.There are other possible problems but fix these issues before you try something else.,bodyweightfitness,ct0swbj,3,t5_2tf0a

4540935,0,t1_ct305mr,Dips and HSPU are both vertical pushes and most pushes work the front delts very well. Dips use lower chest and lower traps more HSPU upper chest  and upper traps. Thats about it. Some other minor stuff changes too like rear delts getting a bit of a larger role stabilising in HSPU but eh. Its a lot of stuff and I honestly dont know what else happens. Anatomy is weird.OP Which one is better depends entirely on your goals. Weighted dips are great for mass and pure strength but if you want to do handstand pushups eventually youre gonna have to work those. As to why youre arching a form check would be great. Its worth noting that the startbodyweight images for that progression are absolutely terrible so dont try to look at those for a guideline.,bodyweightfitness,ct30hps,9,t5_2tf0a

Is it better to be over or under? I weigh  pounds and usually eat between  calories but today I hit  which Im actually pretty impressed with I was shooting for  and didnt even think Id be able to eat that much.I still dont understand how people have trouble eating enough.But anyways. Macro targets are somewhat arbitrary. As long as you are getting a decent amount of protein g should be a fine lower level dont stress out about it. If you are trying to gain weight eat somewhat more than your TDEE It would be better to err on the side of too little food and gain weight slowly rather than eat far too much.

Good on you for recognizing it and wanting to do something about it.For the exercise why not check out our recommended routine in the sidebar.  I think it is a good starting place!  At first it may be difficult to create the habit of doing it three days a week but the more you discipline yourself to do it the easier it is to stay consistent.Regarding your diet it seems you are aware that fast food is not very helpful when trying to be healthy.  Homemade meals are best if you can make them.  But at the very least I would suggest you start by cutting out fast food and trying to add vegetables and protein to your diet. See this link in the FAQ for more information on how to eat healthy.... Best of luck to you! If you ever feel like chatting with us in real time feel free to check out our IRC channel  Theres almost always people here ready to answer additional questions.EDIT I agree with uAzeTheGreats suggestion to see a doctor.  Selfdiagnosing deficiencies isnt very beneficial.  Your doctor should be able to tell you specifically what is wrong and what to do to improve.

And once you have been doing it for months you will likely be ready for a more intermediate routine. And if you keep reading during that time you will have a better idea on how to progress. Right now dont worry about hypertrophy or working at anyones pace aside from your own. Just be consistent as you are able progress in reps or difficulty of exercises take deloads when you need to.

5176094,0,t3_3lw6y7,Oh man I love a good speed rope. I really enjoyed learning all kinds of tricks that make it really fun and more challenging. Start by getting the form right. Read about how to stand how to jump how to hold your arms and how to hold the handles there is more than one way typically suggested. Find a rope length that is right for you. I decreased my rope length as I got better which makes tricks and jumps require more coordination and precision but increases speed. After that work on your timing and rope speed. Minimize jump height so you are off the ground for a fraction of a second just long enough to allow the tiny rope to pass under you then increase speed. The coordination precision and speed you develop here will be very useful when you start to Learn double unders. Best to treat these like skill work. Just spend a minute or two a day trying it until it clicks. Some learn them faster than others took me months to get one that looked ok others can get  ugly doubles in a row on day one. Just toss it into the beginning of your rope session and let it happen. First priority should be getting the rope under you twice one time even if it is stupid ugly e.g. high donkey kick jump land in a semi squat. After that refine it. After you can do one double under that looks ok try to chain them together. After you get  or so consecutive your numbers increase fast. From there your options really open up and the rope becomes an amazing conditioning tool. Double crosses are really fun while already doing doubles cross arms jump rope goes under first time uncross arms ropes go under second time land repeat. The crossuncross action itself will drive rope speed a good deal. Youll get some sweet welts learning these. Choke up on the handle hand toward rope to make it more challenging to spin fast. Choke down to make it easier. Choking up can be useful when trying to improve hand speed. Choking down is useful when you need to apply maximum rope speed e.g. learning doubles. Look into a speed rope. They make cheapo plastic ones like thisIm not endorsing the above vendor  just an example. There are also nicer ones that spin even better. Long handles make it easier to get incredible speed. I started with a cheapo plastic spindle speed rope then upgraded to a nicer rope. These things can really sting if the hit you which happens a lot when you screw up doing double cross e.g. sometimes get a huge welt on your back and make the ole pain face. I dont think its really that bad. It only stings for a second and the welt is gone within an hour or two. I have yet to draw blood but I believe it is theoretically possible  dont whip your buddies with it. There is a goldmedal winning wrestler Buddy Lee that used the rope a lot as a conditioning tool. He is amazing. Check him out if you are interested in how far you could take it. ,bodyweightfitness,cv9wr5c,10,t5_2tf0a

You adapt to stress as long as you give the body the tools it needs to succeed. While rest is definitely one of those tools sleepingeating are huge ones too if you go for long enough you can condition yourself to working out everyday or almost every day based on how long youve been doing it.People who have been working out long enough can manage two a days  or  times a week after a while if thats what they really want.Reasons not to work out heavy that day or take it easy you dont feel your performance is as good as usual you woke up with a resting heart rate thats elevated above normal you didnt sleep well that night or you arent eating enough either the day before when you worked out or today.

All you need is a pair of rings ideally or a pullup and parallel bars and a long stick eg a broom handle for the shoulder dislocate.You can always add variety with extras but I would suggest that you pick the exercise and then find the equipment not the other way round.

This bound headstand is known as sirsasana  or sirsasana aIn tripod headstand you cant do that so your entire bodyweight goes straight on your head without an easy way to regulate it with your arms. This may be okay for childrengymnasts who dont weigh much but for adults tripod Headstand is not a good FIRST exercise to begin with for building neck strength even though it may be easier to balance cause it requires less core strength.Esther ekhart gives a good progression in this video on the bound headstand.Progressions from the video  Downward dog on your forearms should be EASY for at least a count of  breaths.

Ease into the reps and sets slowly and back off if you get any joint pain in the wrists and elbows. If possible instead of jumping straight to the rings use two chairs for dips and a stick or a bar between them for rows to get a feel for the movement patterns and train correct form.Congrats on your progress so far.

6225530,0,t3_40psvh,Join us over at rketo I started a year ago over pounds.  Im down to ish and Ive transitioned in the past few weeks from my home gym to bodyweight workouts.  A few thoughts from someone whos been where youre at go to Walmart and buy some Dumbbells... Work on your bicep strength tricep strength and chest.  Add some  minute beginner yoga routines to help you develop over all muscle strength and flexibility also the Ck app is a huge plus to help you get your heart rate up and get a cardiovascular burn.  Add this to a strong diet that will curb your hunger and provide your body with what it needs to consistently burn fat all day.  It all starts in the kitchen though.  A few you progress through your noob gains and you burn off some of the bodyweight then I would suggest transitioning to more bodyweight workouts.  I tried to do bodyweight workouts when I was around lbs and it was still to hard even though I had progressed from a lb bench to a  press and made equal gains across the board with my squat deadlift curls etc....lift my own bodyweight was still significantly harder because it required me to use total muscles in conjunction with each other so my core had to be much stronger.

First I only just realized that I never recalculated my TDEE back in the fall of last year to account for the decrease in daily exercise.  I realize now that Ive had my daily calorie goal set way too high.  The only silver lining is that I often ate way below my original calorie goal which means I was still at a deficit for most days.  Ill be starting with the lower daily goal tomorrow.Also ever since I was sick last week I feel that I havent recovered my hydration levels.  I keep forgetting to drink water it is so damn hard for me when Im not in the habit and I know that if I went to the gym I might pass out from the dehydration...thats how bad I feel.  So the goal is just to get myself fully hydrated by the end of this week so that I can go back to a regular training routine next week.Oh on a separate note this week I found out I have Raynauds so Im extraconscious of wearing gloves out in the cold now.  Probably not a good idea to run outside with the temperatures we have had lately so I guess running will wait until spring.Lastly Im in a wedding on Friday and am concerned that I will look terrible in it since I havent been able to do upper body training in months and the dress is sleeveless.

However because you are on this subreddit I am assuming you do both.  Which is good because I am actually more interested in the difference between the two disciplines. I also tend more toward a powerlifting style in my day to day training but I dabble in bodyweight stuff too.  I have noticed a distinct difference in the way that I prep for a heavy set and the way that I prep for a difficult bodyweight move.

He advocates doing bench press until your upper arm is parallel with the ground and that going past that doesnt stretch your chest which is bullshit. Says flies are one of the most dangerous exercises. Also says shit like you can target inner chest and outer chest and upper and lower abs.On the other hand his programs basically have no progressive overload nor specificity nor adequate frequency which is pretty stupid considering its meant for beginners as if beginners know when they can progress or not. He comes up with a variety of functional exercises that are supposed to be better because they incorporate your core or are full body which dont work as well as working their segments with proper exercises.If youre interested in smarter fitness channels I recommend looking up Joshua Naterman GZCL Greg Nuckols FitnessFAQs and some other guys.,bodyweightfitness,d051ach,3,t5_2tf0a

Holding the top position and squeezing your lats at the end of your sets should help too. Also you probably want to start adding weight soon.Secondly I would make sure you are doing them explosively. Even if you cant do a slow controlled pullup with your chest to the bar as long as you can explode up you should be able to get to a muscle up eventually.,bodyweightfitness,d09im1k,1,t5_2tf0a

6692332,0,t3_47afim,gt you have to be working near your limits and not far from themThis is hard to gauge in bent arm strength cos the moment you reach the limit and you try to push through it youll fuck up your joints.Take close push up as an example. If you can do just  reps thats your max. If you wanted to do  of it you can do  rep. But what about ? . reps? Nope. This is where bent arm exercises differ from isometrics. Isometrics are just the same positions held for time. But bent arm you have to take into account of intensity AND leverage. So trying to gauge  now would be near to impossible for the given movement wrt to reps. So what do you do? You lessen the leverage and add reps. So in this case you bring your hands halfway between your normal push up and close push up or anywhere in between P  isnt exactly the middle or anything. And add reps. Rule of thumb to be safe it is always better to perform bent arm exercises at  of your max bent arm exercise so that you dont hurt yourself.SSC works for bent arm exercises too. Just stick with one movementprogression and one repset range for one cycle.,bodyweightfitness,d0bjnmz,3,t5_2tf0a

6956831,0,t1_d13z9zp,This explains some things. Having been in a calorie deficit of  calories every day for three months or so whist doing the RR Ive dropped from lbs to lbs and from about  to  body fat. Going by my obviously outdated nutritional info I assumed my muscles just looked bigger as they are covered in less fat. Lats and shoulders in particular seemed to appear from nowhere and I certainly dont consider myself genetically gifted. Im certainly encouraged by this new information so thank you for that.Is it still the case that protein is very important for keepinggaining muscle in a calorie deficit? IIRC the bodys only source of amino acids is from what you consume or muscle tissue so if you arent consuming enough it will break down muscle to get it. ,bodyweightfitness,d14w2ot,1,t5_2tf0a

Ill see if I can explain it with words and no pictures here.Take a  ft. . meter rope and tie a knot in one end.  Now tie a  lb . kilo plate on the other end.  Hang the rope over the pullup bar.  Grab the end with the knot in it.  With your other hand grab the bar. Do a pullup up.  The weight on the end of the rope will provide assistance. Not enough assistance? Add more weight. Rope too long? Tie a new knot in it.  Tada! You have a pulley system for less than  dollars.   ,bodyweightfitness,d15giha,3,t5_2tf0a

7228646,0,t3_4eexex,Looks good to me. I have some advises that could improve it a little bit but they are just details so its not imperative that you apply them.. I would add some frontal plane movement to the leg day like side lunges or lateral squats. All your work is in the sagittal plane and that can leave some muscles undertrained.. I would add some unilateral leg work like Bulgarian split squats. This exercises challenge the leg muscles differently so they are a great way to get a complete leg workout or fixing imbalances. . I would also change the light deadlift for hip thrusts that way you can cover the two variations of hip hinging exercises. And get a great ass in the meantime.. I would change the plank for side planks because you are only training antiextension exercises. You could think of adding antirotation exercises too but I find them hard to accomplish without machines. Theres always the onearm plank though.,bodyweightfitness,d1zud52,1,t5_2tf0a

7346918,0,t1_d2d7shq,I didnt suggest that ring pu is harder but easier to stay hollow due to the extra ROM. RTO pushups are hard and are scaled the same pppus hands closer to hips. Here is another scap depression drill. An easy way to think about this as you form check yourself is shrugging. Lack of scap depression will bring your shoulders up towards your ears. You can see in your vid that your ears are covered by your delts for the entire range. Similarly shrugging will make your neck look short. If you watch Ryans ears and neck in the GMB vid thats what yours should look like during the entire ROM. While proper pullup technique is important if you cant get scap depression on these it will be very hard for things like front lever. IMO this is the real value of learning this cue as it helps you progress to other elements.

7453540,0,t1_d2owbo2,If I can find the proof later Ill edit this comment but Im pretty sure youre wrong on that. I have read a couple of academic journals that proved doing exercises that engaged multiple large muscle groups like squats increased levels of testosterone and growth hormone which resulted in increased strength in a targeted area.The paper Im thinking of tested two groups both of whom used a training programme to increase bicep strength but only one of whom had squats involved. The squatting group showed a greater increase in strength at the end of the testing period.So anyway maybe consider throwing a few squats in it might help and it certainly wouldnt hurt.EDIT The paper I was thinking of was Hansen S. Kvorning T. Kjr M. and Sjgaard G.

7461579,0,t3_4hhopp,Im by no means an expert and Im probably way worse than you at all other BWF exercises but I taught myself one legged crow from a yoga background.  FWIWWhere are your knees when you do this?   I ask because normal crow feels a lot better with knees up on the forearms closer to armpits but if Im going to try to take a leg off Ill put them on my elbows so that the weight bearing is more skeletal.Instead of lifting your leg back pick your knee up and move it in towards the center of your chest.  You can start the progression here Crow one legged tuck back to crow etc.  Then slowly lift your leg back.  I find that leaning way forward nose almost on the ground helps with balance at first as does experimenting with different widths of hand placement.Hope this helps...,bodyweightfitness,d2qc2z8,3,t5_2tf0a

If you watch handstand pushups planche pushups dips elbow levers etc. they all have the elbows in close for reasons involving stability and leverage. Shoulder impingement is also a possibility for some people especially if they have shoulder weakness or  instability or pre existing rotator cuff weakness.

This is because they spend an ungodly amount of time on mobility and prehab while focusing on endurance. A lot of students get frustrated because they know that they are spinning their wheels and will find themselves modifying the program so they can progress. Those who dont sometimes get stuck for months or years on certain progressions. Personally I think you should seek out some competent coaching. It will be a better time investment and save you a ton of frustration.

7766320,0,t3_4ll0ip, Disclaimer  run everything by your ortho andor physical therapist Stretching  Generally will NOT help. If theres pain the body will naturally respond to the pain by tightening andor spasming muscles. Trying to stretch tightened and spasms muscles does not solve the issue. Stretching cramped muscles is fine but usually back pain is not from cramping muscles. The two main exceptions are tight psoasrectus femorisother tight hip flexor muscles if you can get them released it may help AND if you do not have normal range of motion. Mobility  excellent stuff. Taking your back through your range of motion actively activating and moving through nonpainful ranges is useful. Nonpainful movement as much as possible with rotation flexion and extension and side bending Stabilization  things like transverse abdominis exerises glute bridges dead bugs planks all sorts of exercises like this can help get muscles firing again correctly with the correct timing. Strength  strength training if you can do it without worsening any pain you have will generally help rapidly and extensively. High rep  reverse hyperextensions andor kettlebell swings are my go tos. Massage  may help but also might not. If you loosen up any tight muscles you MUST follow it up with exercise such as mobility then follow it up with stability andor strength work to conserve the tight muscles. If not any loosened muscle will just go back to being tight. This is the same problem that people who use the foam roller have and wondering why their muscles keep staying tight after using it. Because you didnt do anything to make them not stay untight afterward. hips and tspine  Doing mobility work for hips and tpine will also help because it takes a lot of movement off of the lower back.

8092337,0,t1_d4pn63u,Here the TLDR videoBesides from that joke motivation is a poor long term motivational tool as most of the time you get distracted lose focus and then end up not doing it. Thats why most people tell you discipline gt motivation. as with discipline you make use of habits. When youre in the habit of doing some form of workout every day then its easier to continue it andor pick it up if you skipped a day.So I advice you to do two things which helped me a lot. I set myself a goal and made it a SMART one Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant to you Timeconstrained I started something for my health everyday. First something small like starting stretching or the bodyline drills and then I added the RR.So now Im in the habit of working on my health every day and I have a goal I can work towards. For me the goal is handstand pushups. A goal that I reallyreally want to obtain. For me it is measurable and I know how I can get there as I made the goal so specific I have made small subgoals for it so I dont get discouraged by how long it takes.I hope you will find your goal you really really want to work for and that you find the way to get there.

8118909,0,t1_d4sib20,This. From someone who has lost a fair bit of weight in this last year I would suggest going one step further and forgetting about the than you burn part.Eat less calories. Just eat less food but eat better foods. Eat less calories than you burn is great advice if you know what youre doing but Im pretty sure many many people especially people asking for advice from others on the internet overestimate how much they individually burn doing any given activity. I did. Coupled with thinking I neededdeserved to eat large portions after exercise to regain energy I could smash myself physically and put on weight.Eat less calories and smaller portions but maintain a balanced regular diet. Dont eat so little that you feel sick. Accept that the smaller portions are your life now dont have cheat days dont let anyone pressure you into having a cheat day. Dont be unrealistic in your expectations and accept very small changes to happen over a long period of time. Whatever workout plan you have stick to it progress slowly and dont second guess yourself when you havent seen any progress in a couple of days. Running is great for you. Add running but for the health not for weight loss. For weight loss eat less.If you lose a little muscle in the process thats ok as CzechsMix mentions you can bulk read up about bulking later when youve lost the tyre and the bulk should go to the right places but thats for a later time.

8197475,0,t3_4rilzx,A mix of vanity and not wanting my bodyhealth to turn to shit now that im in my mid s. I find once im in the habit of working out its easy to maintain its getting started initially thats the hardest. I would encourage you to keep the habit of working out but train smarter rather than harder. If you keep bashing your head against the all doing the same thing hoping for different results youll just get frustrated. Sit back and reevaluate why you feel you havent achieved what you wanted. You say you have no equipment at all do you think theres a way you can get a doorway pullup bar? Trying to build your upper body without a pulling exercise is next to impossible.Another thing that can help with motivation is finding a training parter or people to work out. Training solo can get pretty lonely at times I struggle with it on occasions and am trying to get my wife into calisthenics for both our benefit.

Anything stomach related is going to hurt for a couple of months especially with the scar tissue building up and you being over protective with your new kidney. If youre looking for a workout right now I would suggest try swimming. Great cardio exercise and will work muscles too.

Cardio also seems to help me feel less sore ive read studies suggesting it helps clear lactic acid and helps get rid of muscle soreness. Foam rolling with a pvc padded with yoga mat helps me feel amazing if I ever get any problems.On top of that right after a workout I take in some heavy carbs and a good ammount of protien I find if I dont eat shortly after training I feel it alot more. Diet is really the number one thing. I have also worked up my overall work load by busting out simple versions of an excersice to failure everyday which makes ur muscle workload that much higher. Exsample if I work handstand pushups I will bust out pushups or pike pushups multiple sets to failure even though I can do  easy.

I try to only eat meat and vegetables some fruit maybe two or three times a week bananas kiwi mango pineapple as much salad as I can handle with some olive oil on it.  I avoid anything processed.  As Jack Lalanne used to say if its made by man dont eat it.  I love juice from a juice extractor mainly I drink fresh carrot with a bit of ginger  but you can throw anything in there like beets cucumber celery etc.I also love eating at restaurants  hamburgers I skip the bun and eat it with a knife and fork Indian Tha and steaks are my favorites.  If I end up at an Italian restaurant I go for a tagliata or some fish and avoid the pizza and pasta.ArabicLebanese food  almost all of that is great if you avoid the bread.I drink mainly water coffee tea  beers a week and probably average one glass of red wine a day.  I never drink sodapopcoke or any other canned beverage.  Obviously the coffee and tea dont get any milkcreme or sugar.  That was a hard transition but now I cant imagine polluting these fantastic beverages with sugar or milk.All that said I am not superstrict  I will occasionally once a month? have a dessert a pizza some pasta and some fries.This works for me everyone is different.

Jumping is very rough on the ligaments and tendons which will not adapt as quick as your muscles. Failing to take care of your connective tissue right away will likely eventually develop reoccurring pain that wont go away until you stop altogether for a while which can set you back weeks or months. Its better in the long run to go very slow in the beginning and invest time now in preparing your body for the heavy work in the future.I recommend starting the molding mobilitystarting stretching routine found here first and avoiding any sort of plyometric work for at least a couple of months.,bodyweightfitness,d6sevh0,2,t5_2tf0a

8761346,0,t1_d70fjz4,Yep Im just starting to recover from tennis elbow tendinitis that came on in May. Be prepared for an extended recovery period where you will not be able to do the things youre used to doing. At first I tried to keep working through the pain because I needed the money. Eventually my PT talked me into wising up. Ive been out of work for a couple months but if I didnt stop I could have become permanently disabled.Ive lost a ton of my strength progress because I definitely cant do pull ups or much of anything else fitnesswise.My advice to you is to tackle this immediately and take it very seriously. It can lead to permanently crippling damage if you try to soldier through it. Go to a PT and get biweekly manual therapy. Get on an eccentric exercise plan.

So if you are doing full body workouts no you should not do bodyweight once and weights three times. You could do BW once and weights two times  that might work. But honestly in the beginner stages I think you would be better off picking one program and sticking to it for at least several months  like six or maybe more.

In my opinion they are running you guys in circles by taking you through PPP and dips and then abandoning them for exercises that do not do half as good of a job and charging you extra to help solve the confusion they have programmed in. Having said that I agree that being able to have interaction like that is very helpful. There are in fact quotas for forum responsiveness now from what I have been told and Coach always has an iron hand in the administration.  Having people by the balls is not a bad way to put it from what I saw back when I was there and what I know about how people were treated and why they chose to leave. That probably makes for some long days and if the program was made properly there would be a whole lot fewer questions... but when I was still there and brought up simple ways to streamline these problems Coach said that was something people would have to pay for. He shot down the idea of putting a stepby step form guide for each exercise... literally told me that if people cant get it from the video they can ask questions on the forum and we can give very basic answers and that if they need more help they can pay for that. I was not satisfied with that answer because we were always saying the exact same thing. Why the f would you not just write that into the program? Answer because youre being a jerk plain and simple in my opinion. The OP can probably elaborate on that if he wants to.I totally agree that if you have to run people through a bunch of drills and troubleshoot things because they cant learn after being shown step by step the process for developing proper form or hold their hands because they dont have the confidence to do it on their own thats something you pay for. Thats a premium service and I think charging for that is the right thing to do.You shouldnt have to pay for a good guide to proper form on the basics though or go asking questions that are constantly given the same answer it should be a part of the base program. Thats just a part of giving a shit and trying to set people up for success in my world.,bodyweightfitness,d7wx1ea,4,t5_2tf0a

9099118,0,t3_54uovx,First off skater squats or shrimps or whatever you want to call them arent a necessary or particularly productive progression for learning pistols. They are actually a very different movement with different requirements than a good Pistol because of the weight distribution... even though you would think they are quite similar since theyre both true single leg squats.As far as the skater squat goes toetouching is a part of that progression. The easiest way is to start with a regular split squat slowly shift forward as the weeks pass until you have very little pressure on the back foot and then start lifting the back foot off as you stand up. You do this closer and closer to the bottom as time goes on making sure that you keep weight centered under or just in front of the ankle... the heel should never peel off of the ground. Thats the hardest part of the whole thing.You can also do holds near the lowest point that you can control without the back foot touching and it helps to do this by starting off in front of a railing small tree light post open door or other object that lets you put the front foot next to it so that you can use your handsfingertips for balance and selfspotting. This is a very helpful step to transition into never using the back leg and it also lets you maintain proper body alignment and weight distribution so that you can learn more effectively.Then you can do the same thing for Pistols though there is also a really good progression that involves sliding the nonsquatting foot forward as you go down by placing the heel on a furniture slider or a foam roller and using it as a balance and strength selfspot.Combine that with a goblet squatstyle counterweighted Pistol and you should have no trouble though it will still require time to learn.I personally use weighted squats andor split squats for the strength side and these drills and some other cues for the Pistol but thats my preference.,bodyweightfitness,d85kf6x,5,t5_2tf0a

Reason is that squat is more fragile  if your back is tired or you are too gassed to really hold it together your form will go completely to shit. If youre tired from Squats sure it will make you pull less in the DL but it wont totally destroy your ability to put in good work. Just squat up to a top set then do the same for deads. Do this twice a week. If youre gonna do more on one make it the squats.Make sure your form is good. I dont think any human alive has put a barbell on their back and squatted with good form their first time. Same goes for Deads.Ease into barbell leg work or experience the full power of the dark side young Jedi. I think every lifter needs to go through the struggle at some point but if you jump into too much work with the Squats stairs and toilets will be an issue for a week.

Your arms will start growing even without adding anything to RR but theyll never get big if you dont stick to a proper routine for a long period of time or if you quit your routine because youve added too much stuff to it. Consistently doing a good program RR in this case  diet to support ones goals are the reasons anybody has ever gotten fitbigstrong.

9786511,0,t1_daiypsz,As uDeltaTriangle said it really is worth it. But thats easy for us to say when we have already established the routine and discipline and seen results. Its harder to see that from a beginning perspective and it takes time to build it into your life as part of who you are rather than something you have to do all the time. To start out maybe just make a condensed version of the RR. Do the warm up and bodyline but skip the skill work. Skip the L sits. Just do one or two sets of each of the exercises in the strength portion instead of three. You wont make huge gains but you will make some and it will still be a balanced routine. Maybe you will start to like it and want more once you start to establish a habit and see some payoff. ,bodyweightfitness,dajefhr,3,t5_2tf0a

Youre basically doing a selfassessment and see where your weaknesses are and then do a few suggested stretches for  weeks. Then you reassess and repeat. Its simple and it works but as i said you need to put work into it. Its not the classic followalong mindlessly kinda program. Ive read somewhere that they are updating it in the close future so maybe they are working on that? Personally ive had great success with focused flexibility doing it three times a week since april .Elements is a mobility program that focuses on three animal movements bear monkey and frogger. It increased my flexibility and mobility in squat and hamstrings but it didnt build much strength i did it after  months of the recommended routine.

9832157,0,t1_dap2m79,Dont know about your elbow pain but everything youre doing could cause it.  Some things are worse with pull and others with push.  As for your form your pullups look like its all arm.  Watch your scaps from the back view.  Your scaps arent depressed.  They stay in the same position through the entire range.  Another way to see this is that your shoulders shrug up to your ears through the entire range.  The asymmetry might be from your elbow pain?Your rows are too fast.  From the vid its hard to tell if you are going to the bottom or are retracting fully at the top.  Also your neck cranes forward on every rep.  Aim to keep it neutral.  The pushups are also rapid without full protraction at the top.  The dips look ok to me but I try to keep my elbows a bit more tucked.  ,bodyweightfitness,dap5guq,3,t5_2tf0a

Its really hard and taxing. But its a part of my yoga routine that I must do. Im getting a lot better though.But in my opinion bridge is the best exercise for the spine. We spend most time of our day in spinal flexion. Doing spinal extension helps balance it out. Healthy and flexible spine is very important especially when you get older it also improves your posture increase your spine awareness stimulate nervous system expand your chest and you breath better.

9899152,0,t3_5gf5fx,My workout journey started in . Fresh out of university aged . I was skinny before university but by the end I had gained lbs I had gone from lbs to lbs. All the alcohol smoking and junk food over the  years at university had taken its course on my body I was in incredibly unfit and completely in denial about the state my body was in. The realisation came when I got my first job and had to buy my first suit. The measurements of my waist and the fact that my shirt wasnt slim fit normal fit but in fact large was the cold hard proof and shock I needed to know I had to change and better myself. I spent the next  months trying stupid diets get quick fix things and never sticking to any programmes  none of these worked!I eventually discovered that there is no quick fix there is no easy way in fact the answer is as simple as everyone has always preached eat less and move more. I started an exercise regime of running  miles  times a week and eating a calorie controlled diet. The whole process was hard at the start but it soon became addictive especially when I started to see real results on the scales and in the mirror. The final reality check came when going swimming with friends who I hadnt seen since university when I was lbs and they commented on just how skinny I had become. I was very happy that all my hard work had paid off but ultimately I realised that day that being skinny was not something I really wanted I wanted to be strong.Just as I started with the journey of losing weight I turned to the internet and found lots of short cuts  easy methods and quick fixes  none of which worked. I tried the  pushup programme I even bought myself some dumbbells and with no routine ended up wasting time energy and injuring myself.Eventually I found rbodyweightfitness. I didnt even know it existed and I cant remember how I found it but I was hooked. I was a long term lerker and little time poster. I learked there for probably about  months before even commiting to the RR shocking I know. Eventually I took the plunge and bought some gymnastics rings and a pull up bar and got to work. Keeping at it day after day week after week month after month. I was getting stronger and putting on size and functional strength.Sadly   months in I started getting a pain in my hip which I ignored stupidly for months. It got worse and worse and over the course of the next  months inhibited me walking properly or running. I had to stop training and sank into a depression. Eventually after a lot of tests from doctors and co I got diagnosed with Sacroiliitis this is a form of autoimmune disease where my white blood cells attack my sacroiliatic joint where the spine connects to the pelvis. Through physio medication posture physio and changing the way I sit walk etc I was able to reduce the symptoms some what and start training again.Long story cut short through the RR I gained a lot of functional strength learnt the handstand and freestanding handstand pushup admittedly banana form and most importantly it gave me fitness goals to help me work through my condition. I can now run and walk again and only have    bad days a month now.I went from lbs  lbs me now  Hanstand bent arm press  I look forward to improving on the current skill set and journey I have gained from RR so far. ,bodyweightfitness,daxvs7i,1,t5_2tf0a

Currently with pullups Im on the low rep range almost x and the last rep in the second and third set are slow and very hard. Last rep I usually hike up my legs a bit in front of me not a swing to get momentum but my thighs sort of travel upwards faster than my body. Is this ok? Should I stop before this? Does this count as a rep? Similar question for rows. Im currently on horizontal rows and Im using rings. My body gets very close to the rings almost above my hands for the first set and the first few reps of the second and third set. Later in the sets I cant quite get my chest up as far and sometimes the last rep I only go a little bit past  degrees in the elbows. I know Im supposed to be getting my chest to the bar so should I stop after I fail to once?

If you want to look at a few fun intervention studies specifically here are a few referencesThe second to last study listed is particularly interesting since the different diets were actually administered using a cafeteria which is actually a much greater level of control in intervention diets than a lot of diet studies in general are able to achieve. The last study mentioned has some really fascinating data showing that post weight loss the resting energy expenditure of those on a low fat diet drops much more significantly than those on a very low carb diet this helps explain why even in an isocaloric state low carbvery low carb diets tend to outperform low fat diets consistently.So far those studies I listed tend to just show that low carbvery low carb diets typically outperform lower fat approaches. This is by no means an exhaustive list but its New Years Eve and my wife is mad at me for even typing a response on reddit tonight but if you want more references on interventions specifically I can provide. Now this whole this whole topic is very convoluted because there are many directions to approach it from. The studies I listed so far just focused on the effect of these diets on lipid factors but not long term mortality data specifically. This is where the discussion will get a lot harder. Regarding LDL much of the focus on diet on LDL has been confounded by the data of statins on LDL. Yes there is data showing some benefits of statins in very specific populations and many have extrapolated that data to apply to anything else that also lowers LDL hence the subsequent demonization of fat. There are a few problems here the first is that statins have many pleiotropic effects for example statins also affect tolllike receptor binding for immune responses which means that statins essentially have antiinflammatory effects. Thus the LDL lowering effects might not be the primary method of action by which statins reduce heart disease. The JUPITER study is a good place to start pondering this information.The other big issue and this is one that I believe is more important when considering diet is that LDL is associated with both VLDL and chylomicrons these can be differentiated between their apoB proteins VLDL contains apoB  whereas chylomicrons contain apoB . Here is a reference from Krauss that is pretty critical for understanding thisagain the second link is the same article but just linked directly to the actual body of the textThis study is really beneficial because it helps actually distinguish the different LDL particles that contain LDL cholesterol. Tables  and  are the brutal data we see that saturated fat intake is associated with an increase in HDL a decrease in triglycerides and although there is an increase in LDL cholesterol its only associated with an increase from the LDLL aka large LDL particles aka chylomicrons which are not atherogenic. Increasing HDL and chylomicrons while decreasing triglycerides and very small LDL the LDLVS in the table is exactly where you want your lipids to be. On the other hand where do we find the most negative impact on lipids from a dietary factor? The disaccharides basically sucrose or table sugar. We see HDL decreases triglycerides increase and the small LDL increases. That perfectly describes an atherogenic subtype. If youre not familiar with why the small LDL is problematic its because small LDL particles are derived from VLDL particles after theyve transferred their triglyceride constituents out. Where does VLDL come from? The liver its triglyceride constituents are typically derived from de novo lipogenesis from excessive carbohydrate intake most especially from fructosecontaining sugar because fructose has to go to the liver first. This overloads the liver quickly and after fructose is converted to fat it is ejected and transported from the liver via VLDL. Interesting the fat we eat which is transported out of the gut via chylomicrons is not associated with an atherogenic profile as demonstrated in this study.The point being even if you want to demonize LDL most studies dont go far enough to distinguish whether the LDL cholesterol is derived from a chylomicron particle or a VLDL particle which makes interpretation very difficult. I avoided discussions particle count here since I used to focus on particle count a lot but the data on it appears iffier now. Now on a different note you referenced studies on omnivores vs. vegetarians. These studies are typically trickier to analyze since they are very observational. A good study to be aware of is this oneThis study is important because a lot of studies focus on vegetarian groups seeing better health outcomes but there is the potential for the cohort to be very health focused in general. In other words somebody who has a bigger focus on health may have chosen a vegetarian diet because they believed it to be healthier but they also engage in a number of other activities that are healthier compared to the regular population. This makes the diet harder to isolate as a variable. The study I linked compares Seventh Day Adventists to Mormons. There are other studies that show Seventh Day Adventists as being healthier than the general population and some have extrapolated that to being a result of the vegetarian diet but Seventh Day Adventists tend to also abstain from things like smoking and alcohol more too. In the study I linked the SDA are compared to Mormons who live a very similar lifestyle except that they do eat meat. When you dig through the results the groups overall outcomes appear quite similar which tends to indicate that since Mormons see similar health outcomes as SDAs and follow many similar lifestyle practices except that they do eat meat then the fact that SDA are vegetarians may not be the best explanation for their health benefits.Also if youre into the big observational studies here is one of the most recent large observational studies evaluating diet on various factors. This one paints a pretty brutal picture that animal protein and fat intake are beneficial and actually higher intakes are associated with lower CVD whereas higher carb intakes are associated with higher CVD rates. Maybe I should have started with this study first since its actually one of the more recent damaging studies to the fat is bad mentality but this study is definitely ruffling some feathers since it came out recently.Anyways Ill call it a night for now. My wife is pissed I am typing a lot. If you want more references I could add some more in a day or .,bodyweightfitness,dbv3dq3,19,t5_2tf0a
10170331,0,t3_5lmje3,I look at it this way. Instead of doing both you choose just one. What do i mean?Instead of eating a solid meal with good amounts of protein and unsaturated fats and then round it all off with a candy bar you do just one. What makes you put on weight is all about how MUCH you eat not WHAT you eat. So my advice if it matter that much to you to have the same low body fat  is to skip the solid meal that is good for you when ever you decide to eat something unhealthy that the majority of the time consists of A LOT of calories. This way you wont gain any excessive amount of fat over time  BUT KEEP IN MIND you will be skipping out on all the important parts like protein and fats that boostmaintain your muscle massstrength. I do however in general suggest losing the mindset of no matter what i wanna have the same body fat  and eat both meals a candy bar is hard to call a meal so i put it in quotation marks at the same time. You will put on some weight but hey at least you will still be as strong as you would without eating the candy bar  and you can cut down on your fat  later if there comes a time where it really matters to you.  ,bodyweightfitness,dbwv2qq,5,t5_2tf0a

10197420,0,t3_5lwwas,Yeah I had this exact pain for months some years ago. Bad dips and bench press caused it for me. I wasnt keep my upper back tight enough and my shoulder was slipping into a bad position that I just muscled through. Since I was young at the time my body could tolerate it for a while but it became unbearable. Even though my back was strong if measured by the weight I used to during back exercises my activation was all sorts of crappy compared to how back exercises feel now even at weights not much greater. As I result Im able to keep my shoulders in position during these exercises and the pain is gone.Probably your upper back tightness in dips is lacking and you have some subtle compensation going on at the top range of motion in your chin ups so in both exercises your shoulders are ending up excessively internally rotated putting excess stress on the connective tissue of the internal shoulder rotatorspectoral complex but this is just a shot in the dark based on the little information youve given. As much as it sucks itll probably take going a few steps back in your training to fix.

10198989,0,t3_5m1odt,As far as Im aware there are no scientific consensus on if its beneficial detrimental or neither to stretch after working out as opposed to stretching at any other time. Assuming one does a sufficient warmup when stretching at another time.It was and arguably is a common belief that stretching after a workout reduces DOMS but the few studies specifically about it indicating that has not been successfully reproduced and several conclude there is no effect. So reducing DOMS is seemingly not a factor.So my question is Do you know of any studies regarding this comparison? I and others Ive talked to have not found one.

Can you do those?Once you get to where you can do pullups there are a lot of options but it is hard to say what can be done for your situation without knowing what your house and property look like.  I was having similar issues and I hung a bar on two jbolts that are screwed into a floor joist in the basement.  If you look at the working loads of hardware youll be surprised what it can do.  Even small stuff can hold several hundred pounds.  So Id take a look around at what you have and try to brainstorm ideas or maybe post a picture here and then go to a local hardware store with people who know what they are doing not lowes or HD and ask them.,bodyweightfitness,dd40o36,2,t5_2tf0a

I dont mean to be elitist or anything but what I love about fitness is it is such a pure signal especially when one is over  that one prioritizes health and well being. Everybody is invited to this party!Absolutely! Im in my mid s and whilst health has always been a priority for me always being when I stopped being young and stupid Id say the best thing about fitness is just being able to do things a couch potatoe would not be able to do. Whether thats because of lack of strength or something else. And Im not talking about carrying furniture to the th floor whilst doing bicep curls but the regular stuff...like lifting a suitcase to the overhead compartment on the train without feeling like it was the heaviest thing ever.

10769331,0,t3_5u0bbq,As far as I know the only way to do it is simply eating less. If you still arent losing the weight reduce calories again. Depending on your specific biology you may be more or less prone to losing muscle than another but from all accounts Ive heard losing muscle just plain sucks youre essentially starving your body to the point that it cannibalizes the muscle it spent so much energy to build. Building muscle isnt cheap it requires a lot of energy to do so your body will hold on to that pretty hard and youll have to stress it pretty severely to induce appreciable muscle loss.Basically youre probably going to have to suffer for a while and your performance will definitely decrease while youre doing it though the nature of your sport will determine how severely aerobic performance wont suffer as much as anaerobic because you wont be eating sufficient carbs peak strengthpower might not suffer as much as repeated I.e. RM strength etc.. Afterwards your performance will be altered though again that alteration will depend on your sport. If weight decreases performance I.e. in cycling or rowing then although your power output might be reduced you may still go faster but if it doesnt I.e. wrestling then you may simply perform more poorly.What sport is this anyway?,bodyweightfitness,ddqrz3v,2,t5_2tf0a

10783174,0,t3_5u8skl,Most plantderived protein is inferior to animalderived protein. In this case protein from oats is inferior to whey protein.  We know that highquality animal protein stimulates muscle growth to a greater extant than plantderived protein. A recent study Macnaughton et al.  Physiol Rep showed that  g of whey protein after acute exercise stimulated protein synthesis to a greater extent than  g of whey protein. It is thought that the high concentrentration of essential amino acids in animalderived protein specifically leucine play an important role in muscle protein synthesis. With that said you would probably need to consume a lot more than  g of oat protein in order to get the same dose of essential amino acids including leucine found in  g of whey protein. Bulk with animal protein whey eggs chicken fish beef not with plant protein!,bodyweightfitness,dds7f5z,-11,t5_2tf0a

I am going to post form check soon last time I posted Ive got positive feedback. but I have switched from chairs to regular dips bars because I thought chair is the problems but it persists.  anyone experiencing the same? how to maintain strength without knowing my current limits? how to get stronger without them? pseudo planche push ups dont feel as hard even with decent lean wrist flexibility is my weakest link with them conspiracy.

Even simple pushups can fuck up your shoulders if you do them wrong. This has been done to death theyre often called strength skills and the like but generally theres a specific meaning to the term skill work used around here in regards to routine construction. Skill work is stuff that requires a lot of practice but not a lot of strength yes that means its different for different people. You do it first so that youre not tired from all the heavy stuff while training it. Levers require a ton of strength and while you have to learn correct positioning this is true for any movement. They are also trained similarly to other strength moves.Conflating these two can only lead to people doing stupid shit by underestimating the stress these moves put on the body  because theyre skill work and skill work is easy and can be done a lot right?,bodyweightfitness,dewwg6p,2,t5_2tf0a

11267421,0,t1_df8ju3u,There are a number of good progressions out there such as the Recommended Routine in this subreddit or the classic tenstep squat progression in Convict Conditioning. For a comprehensive plan that make allowances for all levels of conditioning Id recommend Convict Conditioning where the first steps of the squat plan are designed to accomodate almost any level of strength and skill and where the progressive difficulty curves quite gently upwards.But the basic idea behind gradually strengthening both muscles and tendons and other elements of your ankles is to begin with a squat exercise you can perform comfortable in the lower rep ranges work yourself up to the traditional  x  reps and then proceed to a slightly more challenging exercise. And in this way work your way up from different forms of gentle assistedjacknifehalf squats to regular squats to assisted and half oneleg squats to proper pistol shrimp and other fullrange oneleg squats and eventually on to heavily weighted squats once not even pistols offer you challenge and tangible development any more.If you find a comfortable starting point progress at the right pace and through the right exercises if youve the patience the more exercises and the smaller the increase in difficulty and resistance between them the safer you are almost guaranteed to have the strength skill and mobility for oneleg squats and other heavy duty work once you get there.As such bodyweight squat progressions can be be even safer for your ankles than weighed squats.,bodyweightfitness,df9591b,1,t5_2tf0a

After you get past that first hump and struggle you will feel and amazing boost in physical and mental energy.  Its going to be incredible.  Youre going to get way more done in a day and even waking up will be easier.  Whats left? will become Whats next?.  Just stick with it.  Yoga or even just spending fifteen minutes to half an hour to stretch every day will do wonders for you before and after you start exercising proper.  Similar to above it may be a little bit of a struggle to make this a daily habit but youll start feeling a change after a week or so of dedication.Good luck and keep at it.  Starting really is the hardest part.Edit  Ill include the caveat that my transition to diet and exercise included quitting smoking which in of itself makes those first two weeks difficult but compounds the boost in energy and intangible good feeling found with starting exercise and diet but Ive heard similar stories from others starting the journey to back up the user above me.,bodyweightfitness,dft7l9j,21,t5_2tf0a

I cant really have my PT there at all times and his recommendations were to avoid them and build around it.

11510922,0,t1_dg0nps3,Lachlan has been training as a gymnast for  years now since he was  or  years old. I hung out with him for a few weeks last summer. We hung out at muscle beach a lot. I see a lot of shredded people at muscle beach and Im frankly kind of desensitized to seeing every muscle on a persons body because its so common there. However... Lachlan is so muscular and lean that even to me his body looked absolutely surreal.  It took him several years of serious training to get to looking like that especially for his height of  taller people take a lot longer to look buff with nutrition being onpoint.

The guys who are at the pinnacle with this stuff certainly have amazing physiques but in an athletic way as opposed to a bodybuilder or power lifter build. If your goal is to look jacked you may want to go another direction. Personally I prefer this aesthetic. It has served me well for years.

11560140,0,t1_dg5qpfi,Agree with all of this but here are a few specific techniques that I have had success with in the past. Grease the Groove  Would literally drop down periodically throughout the day and do  push ups. You can time it every  hours if you want or set it around a specific behavior i.e. every time I walk upstairs I drop for  reps. You will do way more reps each day than you ever could imagine doing in a finite time period at the gym and your body will reflect it.. Add one rep each day  Do  max set of push ups every day but add one each time. So  on Monday  on Tuesday  on Wednesday and so on. Could have been mostly psychological but I was able to climb over the  mark by doing this simply because the incremental push up never felt like a huge barrier.. Weighted push ups  Have only tried this with pullups but I imagine it works the same for any exercise. Once you get to a set amount of push ups at a time say  or  lower the reps add some weight and work your way back up to that full set. Once you take the weight off it will be much easier to do higher volume. I plateaued at  pull ups for a while until I added a  lbs weight and dropped down to  reps. By the time I got back up to  reps with the weight  weeks I was able to cleanly complete  pull ups without the weight.Also support the notion of working secondary muscle groups through dips pullups rows etc. to make things easier but just remember that the best way to do a lot of push ups is to do a lot of push ups.,bodyweightfitness,dg6ch43,2,t5_2tf0a

11570934,0,t3_653r97,Ive been reading up on the RR routine and it says you shouldnt move on to pull ups until you can do diamond push ups. But i can do five or so pull ups yet Im nowhere near being able to do diamond push ups. Should i do all three pairs ?  Or leave pull ups for a while until i improve my push strength? Side note I find the bottom of a pull up far harder than the top half. Is that normal? ,bodyweightfitness,dg7kkn5,3,t5_2tf0a

11576336,0,t1_dg8255w,Thats pretty vague without specifics the argument gets diluted. If overtraining and overproducing cortisol hinders recovery youre arguing that overtraining in any sense is the detrimental factor not the inclusion of cardio in an exercise routine.  What I dont get is how can someone argue that the additional stamina cardiovascular endurance etc. gained from going for an occasional jog does not benefit a strength building or hypertrophic exercise routine in this case what the comment I was replying to started off by saying.,bodyweightfitness,dg86mld,4,t5_2tf0a

11607999,0,t3_65ns61,So I just got this cheap dip station. So heres my mini review along with a few questions. The good For  its super solid and incredibly stable and high enough for me to do dips with a straight body Im  foot  inches. It only weighs around lbs total and sets up super fast. Overall not too bad. The bad Its about  inches wider than Id like it to be. The bars are also too skinny and I need to add some tape to thicken them up a bit. Questions What would be the best kind of tape for the job? I was thinking Id use Gorilla tape to add most of the bulk then finish with a few layers of athletic tape. Also will I be risking injury adding weight to my dips when the bars are a little bit too wide? If so I can have my buddy who is a welder bring it in just an inch or two.Oh and...HAPPY EASTER EVERYONE!!!,bodyweightfitness,dgbryya,1,t5_2tf0a
11608387,0,t3_65mr8e,Theres not really a universal answer to this question.  Its really a very individual thing.  Sounds like you are already training at a high level of athleticism.  There are people for whom your current schedule would already be too much and there are people who could add the RR to your current schedule and feel great.  The only way to know for sure is to gradually add the RR to your schedule and see how you feel.  Then adjust as necessary until you arrive at a new schedule which is sustainable.  Another thing to consider is to adapt the RR on days where you already ask a lot from certain parts of your body.  For example on days when you do handstands you may want to reduce some of the exercises which put a lot of pressure on the wrists and elbows.  Id recommend to start the RR on one of your rest days for a week or two then experiment with adding it to one or more of your dance days.,bodyweightfitness,dgbtk0r,6,t5_2tf0a
