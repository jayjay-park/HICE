4066014,0,t3_374aeq,I think that from a research perspective you dont want to use copper or other materials for knapping that wouldnt have been available. Flintknappingtips argues that you knap differently with copper than antler and stone.,knapping,crjr5sp,2,t5_2tj4y
6621386,0,t1_d03q85p,The widertipped antler tool was because of the size and thickness of the TV glass which really is NOT ideal for pressure flaking.  The fatter tip pops off fatter flakes but it also requires a lot more strength and leverage.  A lot of sweat and sore muscles went into doing it that way but... whatever works.  I had sacrificed ruined a lot of perfectly good pieces to my percussion attempts on that glass It only takes one oh shit to fuck up all them attaboys so I just toughed it out with pressure flaking because at least with pressure flaking I had a lot less of a risk of ruining the piece.For what its worth nobody is good at percussion from the start.  It takes time but if you can master it its WELL worth it and a huge timesaver.  I got a point in the mail from a master knapper that is just unbelievably perfect and flawless I took it as a challenge and sent him back a package that was loaded with cool stuff as a thank you and got back an even better point along with a really big one that was nice by most peoples standards but it seemed crude compared to what he knaps.  Of course I didnt tell him that and there wasnt any note in the package but he sent me a description after I received the package and that point was his first successful attempt at percussing out a big blade after trying giving up and trying again many years later in the s.  So clearly even the best of us have trouble with it and get frustrated by mistakes and less than desirable results.Where you put the tip of the tool how much pressure is required and where youre aiming the flake will vary depending on what youre looking at.  Sometimes youll put the tool on top of the edge and push mostly downward with little to no platform prep needed other times youll be pushing inward and microflaking out a platform first that will cup the tip of the tool so you can build up a lot of pressure before it releases.  When you get a good grasp of the basics the science of how the material behaves and get into the groove youll be working that tool like a joystick up down left right diagonal dropping a fattipped tool to grab a finer tip or a grinding stone or whatever seems right to set up for the next flake with your eyes staying focused on that next flake that youre about to take off as well as the following flake that this flake is setting you up for.  If that flake doesnt come off right you just have to say okay take a second to try to figure out why it didnt pop off right and move down the edge to a new platform and angle to work around or even erase the mistake.  You can watch videos give them  of your focus and attention take notes amp try not to miss anything but after giving a little time and practice to what you sawlearned youll come back and notice different things in the exact same video. Thats a small but measurable amount of evidence that in that short amount of time you have made progress and gotten a little better.,knapping,d047il4,2,t5_2tj4y
7356158,0,t3_4g3gw8,Unfortunately that looks like junk. It looks chalky and if so will not knap. The word they use to describe how knappable  a rock is is salicious meaning glass like. You need to find some material that is very brittle. Usually very shinyreflective. A lot of the time you can just kick a rock and listen to it. Although many points have been found  that are made out of ridiculously crappy material like granite it is not a recommended material especially to learn on. If you cant find anything on the ground check railroad right of ways sometimes you can find slag glass there. I have also found beautiful chert mixed in with landscaping rock in front of businesses. Just have to keep your eyes open. Also plate glass and toilet tanks are great beginner material. Cheers. ,knapping,d2ecfaj,3,t5_2tj4y
7360478,0,t1_d2dzjw2,This is what I found out about it  That stuff is iron slag glass. You can find large deposits of it in certain areas where there was an iron furnace. I know a place in tennessee where there is a huge roadcut and they would dig it out and crush it up and use it for road base. Most of it I have ever tried working was really brittle and much of it had cracks. In the past Ive found just one piece of this stuff that had conchoidal flakes from it being crushed or tumbled totally out of place among a bunch of river rock landscaping gravel where Ive found crinoid stem fossils shells flint with a rusty brown exterior itty bitty geodes and other rock.  My guess was that it somehow wandered into the river rock pile from a different pile at a place that sells rock mulch for landscaping.  I REALLY need to look into this and check out the rock mulch that various landscaping supply places are selling.  Ive found some good albeit small flint nodules in the landscaping rock outside restaurants and at other public places and Im sure that stuff is usually sold to these places by the scoop a front end loader scoop or even by the truckload.  Theres not many of us knappers out there per capita so I imagine if I checked out some of these places and brought some arrowheads to show the employees my intentions I bet nobody would mind letting me look through the rocks and fill up a  gallon bucket with ones that I want to knap on and it probably wouldnt cost much either.  Ill be happy with any good knapping material but after finding this pretty stuff Im especially going to be looking for where I can find more of it and hopefully bigger pieces.,knapping,d2eu3pp,1,t5_2tj4y

9916388,0,t3_5gniej,Im in middle TN and familiar with some of the local rock types but even just in this area there are MANY different types of flint and chert and quartz some that knap well and some that dont.  Really need to see pics to be able to give you an answer or info.  Pics can also show if the rock has other features like fractures or firepopped spots that would make it kind of doomed to fail from from the start and not knappable even if its a good type.,knapping,db04oeq,2,t5_2tj4y
