When I went applying for a job I applied to  places and all  wanted to do an interview the very next day. One business called me and told me to bring my direct deposit slip from the bank right away before we even did an interview. Most locations that I got involves hourly patrols rest of the time in the office with the logic being that if we get a visitor they know where we are. They ALWAYS have full and part time work available as well as temp if your into that. The downside is that about  of the time you need a car to get to the location as transit either doesnt go there or your shift ends after transit shuts down for the night. Im kinda lucky as I work late afternoongraveyard and can borrow my parents car and just chip in money for gas every month. If there is an incident I call the police we are just watch and report. Most times I just tell them to go away if they dont I inform them they are trespassing and say I got their plate numbers or inform them of security cameras that will have seen them and they usually leave with a bit of a huff and puff.  Most people dont know if they are trespassing and I call the police the police wont arrest them just kick them off the property. ,myfriendwantstoknow,cgmsdj7,7,t5_2vj9t

4083216,0,t1_crll5rb,Generally speaking a keylogger will simply record all keystrokes and mouse movements with timestamps in a .txt file. It will then either save this information locally or it can be set up to send the information to another location through LAN or even through an email client depending on which one you use. Generally keyloggers once installed are very hard to find unless you know what youre looking for but it may VERY well show up on a antivirus scan so make sure to add it to exceptions list if you want it to stay put. Even if someone finds a keylogger on their computer tracing it to a particular person is impossible unless you set it up to forward info to your personal email or just sign your name on it. Think of it as a bug you are using to spy on someone. Not that ive ever used one that would be wrong. I could never justify it.  ,myfriendwantstoknow,crlpnda,2,t5_2vj9t

5563286,0,t1_cwhi5u1,Heres how I have gotten by at festivals that I did not enter by traditionallegal means...Go around and get people to snip the extra bits off of their wristbands and tape enough bits together to form a passable band for yourselffriend. Use high traffic areas and be quick and confident about moving around. If possible wear long sleeves to keep makeshift band out of sight until you are required to show band. If and when required to show the band make sure to flash it quick and keep moving. Most times security is to busy to worry about one person when that could mean letting far more through and as long as you flash a quick wristband and just keep going most guys wont give a second glance. Just have to be confident walk in like you own the place. This method has worked for me at a few different festivals the hardest part is getting in so if you have that covered then the rest is a bit of luck and playing your cards right. Im not sure if the festival already happened since the post is a few days old but I hope this helps. PS. If your friend does get caught it is highly unlikely they will be charged with anything. More than likely you will be asked to pay or leave. In many years of experience I have never ran into legal problems because of this. With festivals of even a moderate size you have to believe there is a large number of people that are either trying to sneak in or causing problems and getting kicked out and prosecuting people would eventually just become problematic.,myfriendwantstoknow,cwmocip,2,t5_2vj9t

Be smart with your browsing or at the very least use a sandbox browser for the added layer of protection but note even these can be circumvented by more complex malware. The fact that exploit kits are being used more commonly only makes it easier to create undetectable malware literally the click of a button to change the code.

9418122,0,t1_d99fhol,This is incorrect.  It depends on many factors the largest being the company you negotiate with and their policies on reporting to the credit bureau.  Many times this plan would cause your credit to stay low due to the collection company constantly updating the balance of your collection.  Medical debt is rampant and most people over the age of  have something on their credit.  My advice would be to either negotiate a buy out for  of the amount they are asking for or completely ignore it. The longer it stays on the credit report without being updated the faster your score will rise. I have had many people pay off the majority of their collections and their credit score went down every time due to the collection info being freshly reported. Credit doesnt work like you think it should sometimes and you need to deal with an expert in these matters.  ,myfriendwantstoknow,d99t8xx,3,t5_2vj9t

You can search any place like Apex Gun Parts with terms like inert and get results hell even Google should get you some useful results.The tough part will be if you want small arms that were once working but now are nonfunctional. Due to the myriad of import laws any small arms are going to have their receivers torchcut the receiver counts as the firearm according to the ATF so theyll be imported into the US looking like this with the receiver and barrel missing or chopped up. You would have to find someone to then turn this back into a sort of replica and I dont know of a way to do that without making it back into a firearm by ATF definitions.At that point it would probably cost you less and fool anyone giving it a passing glance if you just bought a replica firearm which can be found almost anywhere for much less money. Even Amazon sells them.EDIT To be more helpful I found a replica firearms website Dark Knight Armoury I cant comment on them as a retailer since I only buy working firearms but hopefully this helps!EDIT Heres the relevant ATF PDF regarding a nonfunctional firearm section ...
