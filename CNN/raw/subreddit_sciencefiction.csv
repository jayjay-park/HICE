2546024,0,t1_cmqw16g,I would say that since the programmer is more advanced than us it is probably safe to say that he is more enlightened than us and this entails that he would be working in harmony with the conscious matrix that underpins all realities and is a creative rather than destructive principle. There is destruction in the universe naturally  such as predators in the animal kingdom eating meat  but this is necessary for evolution. For us to have developed larger brains than our evolutionary ancestors we had to consume protein rich substances i.e. other animals so we became predators. Before that we were prey driven by fear using it to escape predators.But with the evolution of language culture community and the resulting dawn of selfawareness and empathy the focus of evolution could be said to have shifted from survival of the fittest in a competitive sense to in a cooperative sense. From a fear response to an ability harnessed or not by choice to sense love. But because love is more complex than fear it is easier to live as an animal and ignore our humanity. But the most rewarding thing to do is to harness cooperation. Kind of like how a coral reef is the breeding ground for all kinds of marine life. Even though individual coral polyps are alive they are much stronger when they combine to function as a superorganism and in doing so they not only harvest much more energy for each individual by differentiating and sharing the workload they also help drive the rest of evolution.But anything is possible. It could be that only your consciousness exists and all of history and reality are just functions of the script  other people are philosophical zombies  and this is all just a cruel joke being played on you. But I think if that was the case why would the programming have any beauty in it whatsoever? Why not just constant grotesque phantasmagorical hallucinations and pain since the beginning?,sciencefiction,cmqwhir,2,t5_2rib5

If you find anything to be illogical you should at least be able to explain why.Or not Id assume.Additionally if you had read the title and the last sentence or indeed the body itself in any detail you would realise it is not a theory much less my theory.

King also has a very different style of writing. Still he sticks with what he knows best which is why so many of his stories have protagonists that are writers in their profession once again not a criticism Ive loved every book Ive read by him.I think its a matter of style and I think you dont like Cards style as much because of the way he portrays the technology which is ok.,sciencefiction,cmsyyu9,5,t5_2rib5

4104393,0,t1_cro388m,I didnt know who Peter Watts was frankly that just makes his article more egregious to me.Take this line And yet more recently Rajesh Rao of the University of Washingtons Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering reported what appears to be a real Alien Hand Network  and going PaisVieira one better he built it out of people. Someone thinks a command downstream someone else responds by pushing a button without conscious intent. Now were getting somewhere.Wow sounds amazing right! ALIEN HAND NETWORKTM omg the future is here! Reading the incredibly misleading summary by Peter Watts you might be forgiving for thinking that Rajesh Rao had actually managed to control someone elses hand! What actually happened is that a signal from Raos brain was recognized the signal that he was imagining firing a virtual cannon in a video game a signal was sent over the internet and a section of the other participants brain controlling the hand was stimulated. This is vaguely akin to having someone waiting for me to send them a text message and when they get it they grab your hand and punch you in the face with it. TECHNICALLY I made you punch yourself in the face right!?The actual advance in this case was the difficulty of being able to recognize the particular desired brain signal in the first case which is very hard. Sending a signal over the internet and stimulating an incredibly vague portion of the brain to produce uncontrolled motion is not something new and is something weve been able to do for years.And this is just one example of shitty science journalism and twisting the facts to fit a narrative in the article. The rest isnt any better. Most people arent capable of critical reading and smelling the bullshit in science related articles they arent familiar with.

5007795,0,t3_3jhjkl,Most of this seems superficial to me.  There are a few significant missteps in the writing which obviously dont kill the overall quality of the films but are noticeable to people who examine the theory on these things.The biggest one is the third act break in ANH.  Lets pretend were in the writing sessions on the script  We know we want a big assault on the death star with Luke piloting and were in the end second act with the protagonists escaping the death star.  How do you transition?Well heres what they did  Leia openly admits that they are leading the death star towards unprepared rebels hopes the plans for a moon sized space station reveal a weakness has no idea if they will. They get there.  They find a weakness seconds later.  Luke is somehow allowed to go on a dangerous mission with no combat training.  Enter third act.That sounds pretty weak on the page and its definitely the weakest part of ANH.What would have been betterEnd of second act.  They get away.  They are positive that there are no trackers on them.  They get to the rebels.  The rebels start analyzing the data.  Theres some interesting speculation about the exhaust port but hell thats a real long shot looks like its shielded so theyre continuing to look for options.  But then alarms go off apparently there was a tracker that they missed despite their best efforts.  Tight on resources they are forced to put amateur bush pilots in seats.  Its understood that they are on a suicide mission that is merely stalling for time.  Further analysis happens side by side with the assault and cpo now has a role to play  he notices that the shielding is only ray shielding a torpedo can penetrate.Reversals doling the information out over time give characters challenges rather than writing off their motivations in lines like they dont care about whats happening.

5268915,0,t3_3n1tol,Congratulations on finishing a book! That is a nice feeling.  Some advice Dont fall into the selfpub rules publishers drool mentality.  There is plenty of room in the world for both.  All the great books that readers enjoy are the result of collaborative efforts involving writers agents publishers editors designers etc.  There is a tendency in selfpub circles to trivialize and even disparage these efforts which I think is unnecessary and shortsighted. Professional editing is not optional it is required if you are sharing work with the world even for free.  Your potential readers deserve a finished product and you owe it to yourself to grow into your potential as a writer. The lack of external trial is the major downside to selfpublishing and if you wish to pursue writing longterm I would really urge you to seek out editors betareaders perhaps even workshops.  Celebrate! The percentage of people who actually finish a book is quite slim. Dont be shy about bragging begging for reviews and selfpromoting its just the way the game goes. And use your momentum to roll into your next project. Writing is an endurance race  the longer you keep at it the better you get.,sciencefiction,cvl5vks,1,t5_2rib5

6318172,0,t3_425n76,Just my opinion but stuff we call soft typically revolves around a hypothetical scenario that doesnt look too much at the science involved in creating such a scenario.Example Man travels to alien planet. Its soft if the book discusses his feelings his thoughts and a few actions he takes to bond with the local squibsquibs whose culture is peaceful and foreign to us softmeats. He finds himself at a philosophic crossroads.It would be hard if the book contains or discusses at length the manner in which the man traveled to that planet in his ship which is a black matterpowered Gspot thruster modified with Asimovoriented particles...or some such thing how he begins his life plants a moisturegenerating seed taken from the belly of a local herbivore whose insides simulate the climate of a rainforest the fruit utilizes a complex chemical reaction that allows it to create turkey dinners and how he grows to understand the squibsquibsthey are composed of gaseous rainbows that generate sound waves enabling them to communicate through Skittlealtered ripples in the th dimension.

My house was filled with Science Fiction books and movies. Of particular interest were tales of WWIII nuclear war cold war becoming not so cold and the like. Fun stuff! Twilight Zone and STToS and most SF movies were staples. As soon as I could read and asked my brothers to pick some books from the collection for me I was off and running with a mix of classics and pulp fiction. Once I discovered the works of Ursula K.

As the series continues the writing team greatly improves on their meshing and their character development.  I agree that Holden appears to be a little thin in the earlier books but he also is criticized in the story itself for being so naive and one dimensional by the people around him everything is black and white right or wrong he declares himself the arbiter of what is moral on several occasions and then his people spend the rest of the book cleaning up after that decision.  Overall I would say that you should stay for the big picture of the story Holden does improve somewhat but it is the entirety of the universe that makes this series great. ,sciencefiction,d0ss06g,8,t5_2rib5

The movie is cool as fuck but for some reason people decided they werent going to suspend their disbelief for this one.

Live in Florida work in New York meet my cousin in Texas for dinner help my father get to bed in California. Then sleep in my own bed and start the day over.

Eventually someone finds a way to get out of the testing rooms and into the rest of the facility at which point the conflict with the ai begins. basically just like the first game.

9228589,0,t3_56oys2,Sounds like a very interesting book! I read the first few pages and have some edits in case youre interested. In the blurb you mentioned the year  twice. I think this is unnecessary Id cut the first one and hints at redundancy in the writing. I believe you are using commas too frequently especially in the blurb. This might be something worth looking at. In the first chapter the characters look a lot particularly in the chapter that begins A chill fell over the mothers face... It might be worth trying to cut out or replace a bunch of these to avoid echoing. I would recommend being careful with PoV. At times it felt like we only had access to Batreshs thoughts and at other times it seemed as if we had access to others. Obviously keeping to a strict PoV is not always mandatory and given your prologue I assume it is possible that Batresh has the ability to see into other peoples minds. But if you are going for Third Person Limited this might be something to watch out for. Also might be worth cutting the prologue and introducing the backstory gradually through subtle hints. If you want people to know there is magicfuture science you can still hint at this early. If Batresh is actually accessing other peoples thoughts you could make this more explicit early on and that would introduce these scififantasy elements. General consensus about prologues is that if you dont absolutely need it cut it. Lastly be careful of mixed tenses. Here That same day she purchased clothing appropriate for the heat.  This should be That same day she had purchased clothing... The way it is currently written it implies that she was walking down the street then on the same day buys clothing then comes across two men seated on a bench.On the whole I think it is well written and I believe the story has a lot of promise. It looks like you may have already completed the series which is extremely impressive! Might be worth investing in a line editor if you can afford it. Good luck! ,sciencefiction,d8lshrl,2,t5_2rib5

9402733,0,t3_59e6bx,Yes I agree with King. There is very little sex in fantasy that is not glossed over or violent fade to black or rape. Books like Kushiels Dart are the outliers. Just look at how many people complain about that one small part of Pat Rothfusss Wise Mans Fear  youd think half the book was nothing but pornography if you went by the reviews. I dont read as much SF but I dont think you get a lot of graphic sex there either  I remember being pretty shocked by a scene in Altered Carbon not by what was described just that it was described at all.Splash blood and guts all over everything but dont put in an honest sex scene. It just like the rest of medialand that panders to this idea that seeing boobs is dirty and nasty and unnecessary while shooting and stabbing and burning alive and every other kind of violence is okay.Somehow watching or reading about all kinds of violence doesnt affect the rest of your life but encountering a sex scene will make you a pervert or sex addict or rapist or something.

The issue with films like Interstellar the Martian and Gravity is twofold A part of their marketing and sell was about how accurate they were and B as you said with exhibits audiences dont know the difference or they take away the wrong message. I dont know the best way to solve that problem but it is an issue anyone working in a publicfacing science or scifi job should be cognizant of.

I am not trying to defeat you I am trying to ask so you can fill holes in your answer to better help OP.If an EMP is all it takes to shutdown an army than that is all that armys enemies need to bring. They are hardly magic we have EMP guns in use right now for shooting down drones. What makes an armor suit immune to them?Why is defeating with guns so much harder than defeating normal soldiers? Why is power armor so much more numerous than tanks?Logistics is a reasonable first step but power armor makes logistics easier too.

Watts is a slog and depressing but possibly has the most interesting ideas of the lot.Id also add Hannu Rajaniemi both the Jean le Flambeur series and also his short stories. Theyre a little lighter in tone well the short stories arent thats for sure but similar in complexity. Also The ThreeBody Problem series by Cixin Liu is quite good overall. A similar level of darkness to Reynolds if less expansive in scope. The translation can make it a difficult read at times but its worth it.Im not a big fan of Old Mans War but it does remind me a fair bit of Heinlein so you will probably like it. Also The Expanse by James SA Corey pen name of Daniel Abraham and Ty Frank is worth a read there is a TV series going but the books are better.
