Ive also branched out into doing reviews of movies tv etc. My primary focus was on LPs and I had  rule which continues today Commentary reflects game rating basically no cussing during say Minecraft but M rated games are free game.. What makes your channel worth checking out OR what feedback do you want to try to make your channel stand out?I have hundreds of videos spanning multiple content types meaning theres something for everybody!. Inspirations! What YouTubers do you look up to? What made you want to become a creator?I dont look up to anyone in particular maybe Lost Pause because he succeeded at making success out of simplicity. Video creation has always been a hobby and Id always dreamed of making it more than that.. Anything else! Link to your favorite video on your channel so far!I dont have a favorite video but what Im most proud of is my Arrow parody LP series Blackbow as I put a year into it amp its exactly what I wanted it to be.

7823421,0,t1_d3uu6wm,Sorry for the long delay but I promised Id give some feedback so I just got around to checking out the second channel.  Maybe its just a consequnce of the VR games youre playing being incredibly shallow but at least for me personally the videos dont click.  Its nothing youre doing perhaps barring some editing choices.  Its just that theres nothing happening in the videos and Im personally somebody who likes either full progress or full comedy bits for my gaming videos.  To me theres nothing going on in the game thats funny enough for me to laugh or good enough to give you something to respond to funnily enough to get me to laugh so its just me watching you play tech demos essentially. But this may be entirely personal to me so I cant promise its objective feedback here because its new territory.  Your quality is fine Im glad you have a camera of you for this this is the one time I really would understand a facecam! theres simply nothing going on with your current choice of content really.Although in your archery VR game video you have your taskbar visible at the bottom which isnt there in the Waltzing Wizard video so just something to note there.,NewTubers,d3vf3rh,1,t5_2ujnz

Most people I know will find your content cringy not because your twelve but because the games you play the way you act and the things you say. Youre content is the part of the cancer of YouTube. Sorry if I offended you but you need to be able to take criticism here are some tips Stop jumping on the bandwagon you come off as forced bland and cringy. Step up the quality editing your videos could make it more entertaining and cut out the awkward silences and bad jokes. Also be yourself trying to be what your not makes you come off as extremely forced and awkward.,NewTubers,d3z3hg1,1,t5_2ujnz

You have an interesting voice and you vary your tone and inflection to make it interesting to listen to.My only suggestion is putting a title card for your different categories of DLC.

8206754,0,t1_d53dp92,First of all thankyou for your quick feedback! Its definitely appreciated. I understand what you mean  I guess its the way I record my videos? I usually just tend to leave my capture card open and then if something funny happens I go back and record it so viewers consequently dont necessarily see everything in its full context. With the intro to that video that wasnt plannedscripted if thats what youre getting at we were literally talking to each other that way and I recorded it xDI have considered adding a commentary at the beginning to these types of videos or something to let the viewer know completely whats going on  perhaps a couple lines in the description for context? Im open to any ideas Ive just found that commentaries in the intros that tell the viewer the context make videos less interesting for me and the viewer.Thanks once again! ,NewTubers,d53ed8i,1,t5_2ujnz

8241538,0,t3_4s96pf,My channel is very new about  weeks and Ive found reddit to be great for getting views and subscribers. Plus its great to be part of a community. I dont get a lot of comments yet but I do like to interact with viewers.

8261628,0,t3_4sl8i4,Its a problem Ive been looking into since I became a mod but I havent found a satisfactory catchall solution yet.  If I go one way we run the risk of overmoderating if I leave it its still a link dump in some form etc.  As everybody else noted theres a good middle ground now with the discussion posts and all the feedback posts.  The stuff weve implemented since late May has really helped  FF has revived the community and inspired dozens of new Feedback threads Spotlight encourages users to contribute to the community and so on.  The Hit and Runner flairs will start showing which links are ones to check out and which are to be ignored once we get more people who can start assigning those flairs.Ive said in many other places its a process.  At least from what Ive seen were the only sub of our kind trying to push forward and pushback on the link dumping whereas everything else Ive seen is currently a wasteland.  Were getting a thousand new subscribers every two to three weeks since May it seems we were at  last Saturday! so its going to be tough either way especially if our growth continues.  My best piece of advice Upvote what you like report things that are breaking the rules contribute and get your name out there to the sub.  The community is good at remembering names and if youre scratching backs the people here are good at scratching yours.  And if you see users that are clearly only in it for themselves not commenting anywhere else just posting in a bunch of upandcomer subreddits shoot me a PM.  Im only one guy Im bound to miss stuff.,NewTubers,d5a9ffb,1,t5_2ujnz

But the overall length is good for a moments video but you could have gotten to those moments faster.

But as a viewer i would love to see a bit more personality come in to your video. I know you spoke about work for a brief period but i would love to get to know a bit about Jacob OMally! E.g What did you do today? Maybe a story? Were at a point in YouTube where basic commentaries wont cut it anymore and i feel like this is what you need to do.

8363828,0,t1_d5mxtq7,I think this is the first nongaming channel Ive seen scrolling down on this thread. I didnt watch the whole thing just the first  minutes straight and then i skipped around a bit past thatI like that you established what the video was going to be about before you did your intro animation. The video is very informative from what I watched but you also added your own take on things and made it your own. Uh I guess if I had to suggest something Id suggest adding some sort of visuals as you talk. Like fade in pictures next to your face occasionally that are related with what youre talking about. Or maybe text every now and again. Like if you put some text that says what part of the  step process of forming a trauma when you talk about that. It will make the video seem more structured and if someone missed some info and needs to go back then it makes it easier to know what part of the video they need to go back to.,NewTubers,d5n13bs,2,t5_2ujnz

8367247,0,t1_d5nfc3z,Sony Vegas has a built in compressor in the effects rack of your audio clip. Set the attack to around  and leave the release at the default setting. Bring down the input gain to where your decibels average out during playback. Itll make it so the vocals will never go over that compressor meaning nothing will seem overly loud and jump out at you provided that it didnt clip at all in the recording. You can then adjust the output volume to the max volume you can get it to without it clipping if you want. That way your video will be as loud as it can possibly be without actually clipping or distorting. I know this because I mix amp master music in my downtime.,NewTubers,d5nggf5,1,t5_2ujnz

8404313,0,t3_4uo369,It feels kinda weird giving constructive criticism when Ive only just started shooting video myself. But here goes...I thought the overall video was very well put together but the intro did seem overly long. And though the video editing was tight with the sound it was sometimes difficult to hear you clearly over the background music. Maybe the video could of been a tad shorter but overall I think you promoted the game very well. Here is one of my efforts ,NewTubers,d5s32c5,2,t5_2ujnz

8417151,0,t3_4uxgq9,Your commentary itself is pretty good although the volume of your voice could be a little louder. Your facecam is running at a pretty low framerate makes it look kind of jumpy.  minutes is a lot for your viewer to get through. I will admit that I skipped through a couple of parts because of the length.On a lighter note I like your intro and you have a pleasant demeanor which makes the video more fun. You have potential its just a little rough around the edges. Keep it up!,NewTubers,d5toquf,3,t5_2ujnz

If you must know my favorite teams for the sports I follow are San Antonio Spurs basketball Chelsea soccer San Francisco ers football and Oakland As baseball.

I havent played Salt and Sanctuary so I cant be too specific but Id make the cuts you suggested and also cut out things like any sections where youre just wandering for a while without anything happening or if you spend a while in the menu doing inventory management.

But if you make videos in certain things go to the forums of that thing. If you play games the game youve been playing a lot recently would probably have a good community to stop in and leave some feedback. Remember your there to meet people not shove your channel in there face. Once youve established that you can post links to your stuff and your statistically x more likely for them to actually look at your content.So yea I got the most views Ive ever consistently got back on the Minecraft forums by making lets plays of brand new maps uploading fast and telling the map creators they could use my video in there lets play sections. Usually my video would be first in line and I actually got thousands of views on a video from just this method.So this community is good other forums and subreddits based around your video themes are another good place. ,NewTubers,d5xw6ph,1,t5_2ujnz

You would actually be surprised at some recent Android phones and how good the video quality can be on them without much need to go into manual controls. Most newer phones these days have optical image stabilization which can help immensely with video quality and helping prevent shaking in the video.

8521029,0,t1_d66h03o,Thanks! I spent last week not vlogging as I was shooting for a camp in the middle of nowhere Idaho. I dont know if youve followed along but Ive mentioned I would be putting some of my favorite shots in there. Probably could have been less shots for sure but maybe I should have prefaced what it was in the video. That is great advice and I appreciate it!,NewTubers,d66ou1i,1,t5_2ujnz
8521198,0,t1_d66p1oo,Yes i plan on putting more humour into my videos its a little hard but i can try to do so im glad you liked it.Your video is good but i felt like the pauses were too long and you spoke a little too fast i think you could also change your youtube name its quite obscure for a channel that aims to get bigger. Also think about putting dot points or put your reviews in different parts like story line and character development and such and have that written up on the screen. Try to use different type of music and also at the end have a bit that shows your other videos and links people to them this is a good way to lead people to your other videos.,NewTubers,d66plhu,1,t5_2ujnz

8530889,0,t1_d67vjdo,Hi wagorax I went straight to your channel instead of watching your video really nice channel art and picture by the way.I would say you need to start by making a channel trailer I have no idea what games you play what you enjoy etc. It gives me an idea of what content to expect in the near future from you.I would also recommend putting your videos into playlists so that they are easy for an audience to find videos specific to certain games e.g. DOTA  with a catchy title some people will search for this and with the right keywords and phrasing you could rank yourself higher within YouTube searches.You clearly have a passion for gaming which is really great however it may be better to show in your About section what games you particularly cover on your channel and what you will move onto next.Just a few suggestions but keep up the good work and hopefully youll see success within the next few months through your channel ,NewTubers,d67xbi7,2,t5_2ujnz

8537196,0,t1_d68pl8u,Thx for the feedback!Well for your channel if it is the right one im looking at I hight reccomend that you add some channel art and an icon. If you dont do this your channel will never take off. Put your next videos into a playlist so that everything is more organized. Your video didnt seem really like a gameplay video. It just seems like a cool moment in csgo that you happened to record and publish to youtube. If you want to grow on youtube you need to add some substance to your videos ei. commentary longer videos more engaging gameplay. It takes time though but dont give up!I hope I wasnt too harsh but i really do hope this helps DGood luck on youtube!,NewTubers,d68psoj,1,t5_2ujnz

Video length is a battle that I think I am going to turn the tide on shortly I am shooting for about  minutes each episode so we will see if thats a bit better. I always try to give a quick update both for myself and whoever new is watching hahaNow to your videochannel. Oh man gotta love me some GTA V Montages! I can only imagine the hours of editing and attempts with footage it took to get all this done. Very impressive and had me giggling all the way through. The behind the scenes was also hilarious in its own blooperesque way. Your thumbnails are on point very well done. I have got to work on that for sure XD. Your playlists are set up pretty well I dont know for sure if it covers all your videos. Overall very hilarious video and your content is short sweet and to the funny bone.

New style of video new way of giving information. So a lot of trial and error. I also decided I wanted to recreate the breaking bad intro. I however had never used AE before... So I had to learn that AND make the intro. All in all it probably took me way longer than necesary.Other long videos are DOOM throughout the years    hours  and Doctor Who Through The Years  ish hoursOn average I spend  day makingresearching my script half a day recording and a day of editting.

IF theyre not then they are the typical internet troll who gets a perverse joy out of insulting others and finds it funny. Very simple rise above.  I watched your video and while I hope that it helped you get it all out and I hope that you are able to shrug that off and rise above. Sounds like you are.Frankly to hear that you had that experience in the NewTubers Discord? Thats horseshit. Personally Ive only been on the discord once its just not my thing. But with exception of one thread I saw this morning where someone commented on a post about childrens videos with I thew up a little... Ive come to see this place as a bit more judgement free zone. Im sad to hear that perhaps the Discord is not that way.You ARE your content not your subs. The subs will come with the content and the work you put into marketing it.I felt a great sense of accomplishment hitting  today. Does that define me or my channel?

Even though the video was over  minutes it felt quite a bit shorter. My only comment would be to raise up your audio gain on the whole video. The video is much more quiet than other videos online forcing people to raise the volume to watch your vid and lower it when they move on to another video.If you want to check out my latest video I would really appreciate some feedback   Thank you!  ,NewTubers,d6ikp7i,1,t5_2ujnz

I believe Ive given feedback on that exact video before!  lol as I noted last time Im not a DS guy but I found it entertaining enough to hang on through the whole thing last time. As for the channel art I think it works for your channel style although two things bug me The overlay on the top where you have the glint on your sidetriangle things moves across the whole banner which looks offputting to me like you put a yellow screen over the top of your banner.  Also the font for your channel name being different in size from letter to letter bugs me marginally but I also dont fully mind it so dont take that too much to heart.  Just something to note lol.  I think it looks professional and fitting for your channel outside of that yellow screen issue.Now just make sure to critique two other users in the thread!,NewTubers,d6j0twe,1,t5_2ujnz

8647675,0,t1_d6mjscg,I liked You use your home page to demonstrate your playlists and most recent uploads well making it look like a channel and not a personal upload page. You link to your other channels and social media prominently. You make use of channel keywords which is a common thing people tend to forget. Your about page explains everything about your channel. Your descriptions include all the information a viewer might want...I didnt like ...and also overwhelms me with more links than a warez site. Your thumbnail branding is either nonexistent see Red Hands abrasive and ugly see Subtact  Anything or completely nonsensical see LarsM  Lovers. Your channel art is difficult to look at. It appears to be four separate and disparate parts The crayon etching scratch art background the brand icon girl the comic sansesque title and finally the random Copyright free text. Its jumbled and honestly hurts my eyes. I looked at your featured channels and of the ones that also do music you stand out as being the least colorful. I would happily stay on Linguistiks page.OverallThe quality of the music aside the thumbnails dont make me want to click the channel art doesnt make me want to stay and the brand is seemingly nonexistent.

8651412,0,t3_4y98fc,I watched your quantum break video. You are a new channel it appears. But work on getting a better mic. It seems to cut out making it hard to understand sometimes. Not sure what was up but the gameplay seemed to skip a little as well.But like I said Im not sure if that was actually on your side. I enjoyed the commentary you seem to have a knack for that. So good job. Personally Im not to into long videos but thats just me. Here its my video! Thank you.,NewTubers,d6n1fym,1,t5_2ujnz

8653320,0,t1_d6mnokq,I think if youre unsure on what to specialize on its important to try whatever you like and slowly find your niche. Being a small channel gives you the advantage of being able to screw up without any big consequences other than feeling embarrassed that you tried this or that video and ultimately privating it lolYour thoughts are very profound in a sense in the artsy video but the music was a bit too loud. Make sure to adjust the volume during your editing program. On the otherhand your educational video and audio werent lined up correctly. If your editing program allows it make sure you zoom into the timeline and get it down to frames so the audio matches your mouth.All in all both videos were interesting but definitely find the right niche. Even though you dont have a lot of time just do what you wanna do for now. I cant really tell you to do this or that content because Im not you and I may end up pointing you the wrong direction!

8664767,0,t1_d6opa70,Okay very much potential here I really like the tune going throughout the video keeping a familiar song or track with your videos can help give an identifiable persona online so id recommend keeping the track you have on there Secondly I recommend a different font as it isnt an issue to keep the one you have but if you go on websites like DaFont they have thousands of fonts that you can find and help pick one that sticks that you like.Id really recommend looking into editing software such as Sony Vegas Premiere Pro Final Cut Pro etc. Depending on how you where you want your channel to go theres hundreds of resources to use as to decide whether you want a serious gaming channel or a comedic one or anything of your choice.Maybe get a few more of these CSGO short clips and compile them into a compilation as that can definitely appeal.And of course youre new but perhaps a social media link may help for future viewers to connect with you too All in all great potential just a few things youll definitely pick up on if you keep pursuing it!,NewTubers,d6opqa7,1,t5_2ujnz

8678718,0,t1_d6qgbgs,Hi amp welcome please dont be offended as not Im trying to upset anyone I write this to everybodyNo problem this seems like a cool community and I just want to help out. So lets get started!As for intros I dont really feel like... you have any. A good idea would be to upload a channel trailer containing some of your gameplay highlights amp info about your channel. Channel intros are important! I watched some of your videos and they dont seem to have an intro either as the gameplay just begins immediately with some music. If youd like an intro you could download Blender for free and use a premade template do make your name do cool stuff. Heres a video for that  Just choose one you like and download it in the description.Your thumbnails are simple as you said but unfortunately in a bit of a bland way. I think that the matching background theme of your thumbnails and videos doesnt make it better either. But dont fret! Theres lots of ways to make cool thumbnails for free even. If you dont have Photoshop you could always use PicMonkey or Pixlr theyre great tools for being free. I suggest taking a screenshot of the gameplay as your thumbnail and then adding text similarily on all of your thumbnails with these CSGO highlights. To give you an example This playlist uses exactly the style I described and makes each thumbnail intriguing. You could ad numbers if youd like Part  Part    etc. but its not necessary for a game like CSGO.Your outro is simple and alright but at one point you should consider upgrading it too but it works for now. Im not very knowledgeable about CSGO gameplay but at least I thought the captions you added were funny... Just keep getting good highlights I guess? I really dont play this game...This might be a bit much but please keep in mind that Im only trying to help by naming everything I can think ofthat you asked for. For only just starting out youre doing fine! Let me know if you have any thoughts or questions!,NewTubers,d6qgp0q,2,t5_2ujnz

Works for CC or CS In point shortcut I Start off with clapping especially with video once you have it and make an in point once you hear the sound on the audio track repeat for other audio tracks that you have.For Video make it at the frame where your hands connect Same theory as in professional filmThen select the clips and right click to merge click and select by in pointsLooked it up real quick as an example close to it   Dont know much about thatHope this helps,NewTubers,d6sfq08,2,t5_2ujnz

8701129,0,t1_d6t98tj,hey bigboyBpis! those are some great questions... lets take a look... Looking at all your thumbnails I can tell youve been trying to get better and I think this one is your best to date. I would prefer it to be a little less busy though. With such a small image for viewers to see try your best to keep it as clean and simple as possible while still eye catching. Its a tough line to balance i know! Still its great to see you getting better in that area as your channel progresses! I like the smack talking between you and your friends and your commentary throughout was pretty good. The mic was a bit quiet in some places and your friends mic was a bit muffled as well. Also try to raise your energy levels and enthusiasm when you are commentating. I thought many of your one liners were funny and a more animated delivery would take it to the next level i think. Your editing i found to be good especially for your th video! Be careful that you dont over edit especially one right after another as it can become distracting and too much. Other times I thought the editing was hilarious like at . I think the key is editing during your funniest moments to really let them shine! That way it surprises your viewer and really gets their attention. Overall fantastic job on just your th video and I wish you the best of luck as your channel grows!,NewTubers,d6t9uys,2,t5_2ujnz

8733627,0,t1_d6xc1hq,I didnt know the age of the videos. I just clicked on what for me sounded the most interesting.The GoPro is whats causing the lower video quality. I have used GoPros for filming before and I never saw one thats as good as my camera or even my phone. Gopros are more for action shots.I found the audio to be... hollow. As thats the best way I can describe it. It felt echoy but more as if youre in a cardboard box. It wasnt all that clear. Maybe partially due to the louder music that made it harder to hear the audio.Id be brutal if your video was shit. It wasnt.

8744407,0,t1_d6yoocy,Ill start with the thumbnail. I think its good it clear what game youre playing and the fact that Batman is in it made me interested as its something different  id not seen that mod. My only criticism would be that the thumbnail is quite dark so wouldnt neccessarily stick out in a page full of videos.LeftDead isnt really a game i enjoy watching too much so i suppose im a good test for your video! It was entertaining to an extent. I think you and your friends bounce off each other quite nicely and your patter is funny. I liked the guy just saying I am Batman haha. An issue though would be the audio between you seemed quite uneven. I kept turning my speakers up to hear one of you better then another would speak and there would be a crackle as its too loud  so maybe you could equalise that somehow.Final comment for me would be video length. IMO a video without a purpose should be relatively short. I dont mean that in a critical sense i.e. your video didnt have a purpose and was a waste of time. I mean that if a video is a tutorial or a discussion or a review or whatever it should be long enough to get all your points across. But if its a lets play this and make a fun video then the approach i prefer is short and sweet. I know you edited a bit but could you do so even more? Or maybe split it into  episodes?But generally it was an enjoyable video. Personally i would probably say if i stumbled across it i might not have watched it start to finish because it gets a little bit samey after a while. But thats just the nature of the game!,NewTubers,d6ypcxd,2,t5_2ujnz

I appreciate the advice on that Ill look into that Tubr Buddy app. Dark Souls is an arduous game at times and finding invaders takes a minute had to edit it down. Ill be keeping the audio lower and now that my friend has a new Mike that isnt an old shoe his audio will be much better.

Reminded me of the old Sim Copter Game.  Now in terms of your introoutro I have a few notes.   . Your annotations cover up the Thanks for watching so may want to move those around.   . The quality of your intro and outro does not match the rest of your video. by which I mean the main part of your video is better quality.   . This is more personal choice but your intro is what should draw people in and the look of yours would kind of make me think you werent putting much time into this. Not that that is true because your video was well put together. I just thinking adding a bit more too it could help new people from clicking off early.  Again I enjoyed the video keep up the good work. ,NewTubers,d72p6k0,1,t5_2ujnz

I know thats pretty useless to say and its not very constructive but the stopping and starting does make me feel a bit uncomfortable for some reason.I reckon give the other way youve got in mind a go and see how it looks and see what people say! They might love it.,NewTubers,d739x0a,2,t5_2ujnz

8792461,0,t3_50k5je,Usually what I do is some vocal warm ups so my commentary can be more clear. I can stutter a bit on mic but those warm ups help me avoid doing that while I record. Other than that I dont really have a ritual but I might try out listing to some game tracks. That sounds like a good idea!,NewTubers,d74qgbj,1,t5_2ujnz

8799837,0,t1_d75lrk9,Well with animal sounds it is tricky. The best thing is to get a large variety of sounds so that you never hear the same sound twice in a video. With animalshuman noises when you repeat sounds its very noticeable because we expect living things to sound at least slightly different every time they make noise.,NewTubers,d75mcot,1,t5_2ujnz

If you can get the FPS to be higher it would be better.Your facecam was perfect.You didnt seem to have energy to match the fact that youre trying to survive a psycho murderer.

8804039,0,t1_d75nzrd,Hey i really liked your family friendly video  i thought it was funny  and you were really engaging. You should tidy up your editing however because the black bars moving in and out were really distracting and the other edits in general made it seem a bit cheap. Other than that tidy up some of your thumbnails to give your viewer a clearer sense of what your channel is about and keep up the good work ,NewTubers,d764jxm,1,t5_2ujnz

8821273,0,t3_50zuux,Youre basically asking for advice on how to fake what you arent. Dont go this route!The reason why your face doesnt communicate the same emotion your voice does is because they arent true.Dont try to be someone else.

I think the video was a little to long for my taste i ended up skiping parts overall good video man!,NewTubers,d78m2n5,1,t5_2ujnz
8825509,0,t1_d78mf9d,Hmm... Okay I liked the content  It was interesting esp that drop in his views in  and I felt like I actually got something useful from your video. So positive overall but Im going to try to be helpfully critical as well. Your accent is a bit thick which made understanding you a challenge at points. Accents are a HUGE bonus but anything that interferes with comprehension can cost you viewers. I felt the pace in the beginning was a bit slow though you picked it up nicely in the middle. And those point beeps were a bit loud compared with the rest of the audio imo. But again really found this interesting and watchable. ,NewTubers,d78pcwi,2,t5_2ujnz

I realized as I was writing the description that it was hard to not seem like a cash grab or a greedy doucheb so I wanted to think about it more. Here is what I ended up writing as the descriptiongt I find most online videos about technology to be a little too heavy on the spec dump. They will spend half the time telling you what youve most likely already read online before you even watch the video. I want to make videos about technology that wont put you to sleep but will make you laugh all while still being informative and useful.gtI am just starting out and your support is greatly appreciated. I plan to use the support to increase the number of videos I am able to create fund some of the projects for those videos and ensure I have OK equipment so my videos dont look like a sex tape in bad lighting.

I like how it invokes memories of getting up on a crisp sunny morning and just going for a drive with the music on. Its calm and relaxing. You watch the video and it allows you to view the world that you normally wouldnt go to. In fact it reminds me of driving one of those games where the aim is to just drive around and you take in the view.At first I thought you were a channel that catered for film users and music to use in their own projects but you know what. Keep up the work youll be there in no time. Organisational stuff looks good and Im not sure if I saw it but itll be a good way of exploring various parts of the world with music.

9005359,0,t1_d7tjl5l,Over  hours of video time are uploaded each minute on YouTube and half of that get less than  views. So almost  views shows you must be doing SOMETHING right. Whether its the topic or your SEO or something else. I can tell you put a lot of work into this.I think the reason youre getting so many downvotes and so little comments is due to the fact that there are so many intros in the beginning and theyre also premade. I really think the special thanks section should be at the end of the film. People want to get into the action asap especially with a homemade documentary.After looking at your channel I probably wouldnt call it a gaming channel. But I saw your adventure time video and I think you should try to replicate more of that. You seem to be relatively good at that style and people seemed to like it. ,NewTubers,d7uay64,1,t5_2ujnz

9019234,0,t1_d7vukfd,I almost came in here about to blast you for having no sound but realized my speakers were off haha. So Im gonna make a list of things I saw as I went through the video. Then sum things up at the end. I feel like Im watching a parody of any MTV show ever. Cribs? The editing is really good I find the music in the second part a little to loud and I dont think its really needed. You win points for locking yourself in your own car.  Having your kid in the video adds a bit of likability. She seems to actually enjoy being there compared to other people who I feel throw their kid in front of the camera when you can see they dont want to be there. It just adds an interesting dynamic. Not boring. Please suspend the women behind the camera without pay.  The outro is a tad bit long. Like you seemed to end it but then followed up with a different ending. Strengths The editing was really good your likable the pacing was goodWeaknesses the audio mainly music being to loud. Also the music you chose got somewhat annoying. The outro was the other thing All in all it was entertaining. I didnt mention it in the weaknesses but I agree some stuff I felt didnt need to be in there but I see why it was. Like I think it was some of the zooming in on your daughter when you guys were making the shirts. I cant remember the other ones. But I enjoyed it so keep up the good work man. Enjoy the rest of your day.,NewTubers,d7vyyhd,1,t5_2ujnz

Your audio quality however is frankly kind of shit both times you spoke into the camera. During the clips it was fine but when you spoke into the camera there was a significant drop in quality and a nasty echo. Find a better setup or cut those out all together. It really took away from an otherwise pretty good review.,NewTubers,d7yb7rj,2,t5_2ujnz

9103463,0,t3_54y0cv,Hey man checked out your video here are my thoughtsComedy was good reminded me of this crazy Dutch guy that used to come by my work though at times I hear a little bit of German and Russian inflections creeping in. Sometimes the accent was a little too thick for me to understand all of what was said. The interviewer accent was harder for me to place. Sometimes I thought I heard Indian other times not.I think the cut between Douchebag and Interviewer audio is a little too hard. I think to pull off the effect of Douchebag interrupting the Interviewer you may have to play with the fade of the audio a little bit.I would recommend better lighting. I dont know if you have fluorescent lighting in the kitchen but you may just want to experiment with a lamp before you invest in more expensive camera equipment.Lastly while the rant was funny I at times had trouble deciding if you were choosing a side of this satire or if the Douchebag was supposed to make a valid point from time to time. Do you just free rant and let the voice decide the content or do you outline the content so you hit talking points? Overall an interesting format funny voice work on the audio editinglighting before considering new equipment.,NewTubers,d86396v,1,t5_2ujnz

One person wins per day and its about  a day. People subscribe only for the reason of winning. There is no other content on the website. He gets around  daily views I figured.The idea with this channel is exactly that. Its just a give away channel. Users come to the channel just for the weekly giveaway. I wont be posting any other content on the channel.

The unnecessary tension made me laugh. I would recommend investing in a decent microphone because I am a huge believer in audio quality but thats just a personal opinion. There wasnt much that I saw that could be cut out. You could also use a little more enthusiasm but that largely comes with being more comfortable and practice. The game audio could also be bumped up a little bit as long as it doesnt drown out your voice. Very solid start with lots of promise.

I was about . weeks into my YouTube career and only had barely  subs and almost no engagement in my videos. One of the many things that inspired me to start YouTube was the interaction with the viewers. I really wanted that but I wasnt getting any viewers felt like I had no mentors to help me improve and I felt downright terrible.

9173561,0,t3_55y8gw,I dont do vlogs but watch a lot of vloggers and so Ive got some tips .Being a vlogger is all about building a relationship with the audience and inviting them into your life and hopefully getting them to care about it. So to help build up that relationship they obviously need to know who you are so I would recommend that you welcome the audience early on in the vlog and so that new viewers can put a face to the content and can start building that connection.As for your shots I do really like them and think that you did a great job with them but I think some of them went on for a bit too long. It really depends on what is being shown though because even though the clip of the guy with the nail was long that kept me hooked through all of it. If you do shorten them though the length of your videos may be an issue so I would recommend just talking to the camera a bit more about something thats on your mind or maybe show a few more things from your day or something.I would also recommend checking out some other vloggers and learn from them and see how they structure and manage their vlogs. Its also good to see that you do know about the weaknesses that you mentioned just keep practicing them and you will get better over time!,NewTubers,d8eters,1,t5_2ujnz

9215149,0,t1_d8jognk,Hey man ive got some stuff to say about this i unfortunately couldnt relate to the comedy in the video. in my opinion its like youre trying to hard. here are some of my suggestions dont shoot in portrait format it makes it instantly less appealing as a video shoot in landscape its really not that hard and will make your content immediately better work on establishing differentiation in characters as opposed to just turning your hat around its lazy and isnt going to help get more viewers  it just looks like u uploaded your snapchat story to youtube. differentiate your filming locations and add some background it gives the viewer more to look at as opposed to an ugly wall use some sort of a tripod to stabilze your filming work on more intelligent camera positioning and be clever about your camera placement  the snapchat filter was really cringy the type of stuff youll look back on in a few years and just instantly regret the laugh you used in the beginning of the video was an instant turn off it made you come off as less of a comedian and more as a chump employing a lackluster attempt to be funnyIn summation I personally didnt find this to be content to engage me in the slightest but with a little more work and perhaps actually prescripting jokes you can improve. Im sorry if this isnt the kind of response you wanted but im just trying to be as honest as possible. wishing you good luck,NewTubers,d8k377q,1,t5_2ujnz

9231210,0,t3_56t33f,To be frank no. Your channel trailer left me with the feeling that I wouldnt be subbing to you or even checking out your other videos.It was boring and you gave no real reason for me to sub. If anything the only reason I see people subbing due to that trailer is because you essentially bribed the viewer with game giveaways. You need to be able to show the strengths of your channel what is unique and what your low points are. Lastly why do you want feedback? Let us know that. Are you trying to see what works what doesnt? Or are you just being clever about link dropping.Let me answer that for you youre just link dropping. I can tell by the fact that when I go to your profile you posted in  other subreddits with the exact same post copy and paste. So take what I gave you and see what you can do to fix it.,NewTubers,d8m4ge5,1,t5_2ujnz
9237605,0,t1_d8mve4u,gt  I dont know how it works on the moderation side but upvoted posts do tend to get displaced by new posts with lesser upvotes. Currently a give other critique post by geethebee with  upvotes created  day ago is displaced by a I want feedback post by AnTerZzCS with zero upvotes created  hours ago. Perhaps make upvoted content stay longer on the hot page of the subreddit?We cant control reddits algorithms like that AFAIKgt Stricter moderation? Outright ban users for flouting the rules?  strikes or something i dunnoSince I joined the team the bans have been handed out as often as needed.  We give approximately  strikes depending on the severity of the incident.  gt combined with a ban on posts from users with accounts that are less than a month old?Theres already a  comment karma threshold for new posters.  I think that it could be damaging to restrict it any further than that.gtmore bansWe try really hard to get people on board with the posting guidelines and ban as needed but I dont think more bans is the solution.  The problem users are well on their way to being banned.  We have a system in place you just may not notice it in action because once someone gets a hit and runner flair thats their last strike and then after that they will often be permabanned.  gtdownvotingI would much prefer people report stuff anyway so thats not a big deal really.  I thought they were turned back on?gtAutomatically hide all I want feedback posts? Interesting idea but that kind of defeats the purpose of having these posts in the first place.  I am also not sure if its possible with our current tech.This is just another month where the growing pains of the sub are more evident.  Everything will be smooth sailing before ya know it.I also think that a lot of people see spam during the day that is removed at some point and never come back until theres more spam leading them to think that its always full of spam.  Due to post frequency it basically is but thats why following the formatting guidelines are important.  So a lot of the posters complaining to be frank are the ones that havent followed the posting guidelines in the past and they think that the post removal was malicious or something.  Now they want to complain.  With that said clement I know youre not one of those people and I appreciate these suggestions.

They have Comedy tutors theyve been doing improv for years  they know how to hold an audience captive and talk endlessly through a video.try cutting the videos down into more best bits rather than just an uncut playthroughs you might find people enjoy your content more and will stick through it if theyre shorter.aim for  minutes max!,NewTubers,d8q385x,1,t5_2ujnz

9270749,0,t1_d8r34wg,Heres the thing if you think everyone in this community is a retard or a twat then you shouldnt be part of the community. YouTube growth isnt about how good you are at making videos when you start. Even if you are great at video making you still dont have enough exposure to grow. Most people asking for feedback in the community want to just get an opinion they arent asking for experts to tell them what to do. I agree that as things are at the moment its hard to be happy with the community. However the community is getting revamped soon. Hopefully itll be better. ,NewTubers,d8r4ui8,4,t5_2ujnz

9292832,0,t3_57pm7d,Yes this is normal. Overnight success can come but it comes after months and more often years of solid ground work. In your first year your focus shouldnt be on views and growth so much as it should be on improving your craft. Increase your filming and editing skills integrating sound effects and a musical score. All it takes is one fan sharing your video to make it take off but that will only happen if your videos are compelling viewing.If you want to read about my own journey .M views where I talk about where my views come from I posted about it here ,NewTubers,d8txlgz,3,t5_2ujnz

The first question I have is what footage are you recording?Are you doing a voice over after also?If your are doing gameplay with voiceover after then a USB mic for your PC is exactly what you need.  Better quality and cant promise may be compatible with the ps too.  I wont list brands because there are so many and depending on how much you want to spend depends what you get.Decide what you want to comit to you channel then get that.  If you feel a headset is fine then go for that.  I would recomend a USB mic though.,NewTubers,d8vg0js,3,t5_2ujnz

So many comments are people saying things like My mom will buy me a horse if I get  likes and people like the comment all day long. So my question is why is that okay but when people try to promote their page that is wrong. Also understand this is not the same as subsub. This is trying to get real viewers to come check you out. Not come and do a subsub.Understand I am kind of playing devils advocate here. I do not do it but I am seeing channels that do and because of it they are growing. They are getting people that dont have channels and arent looking for a sub back to visit them.So I am just seeing if people here are doing it or have done it and what they have seen from it. I do not look at this as spamming like someone would on a small channel.

9389089,0,t3_594fcz,Yup.  I streamed on twitch for a long time and I got up to  viewer average for a while years ago.  I quit making content and playing games so much and now that Im ready to go back to it I cant get more than  viewers on twitch at one point in time.So I made the switch to youtube.  If Im gonna get next to  viewers anyway I might as well be helping my youtube channel a bit.  Of course if you can stream to both platforms at the same time then that can give you an advantage its just harder to keep up with  chats.Im a bit torn on the idea really.  I have existing followers that will not make the switch to youtubelivestreams but at the same time the amount of viewers you need on twitch to make any kind of money or get some publicity for yourself is not really worth it for me and I hate how you have to sellout.So I guess Ill try to see if I can stream to both platforms without running  instances of OBS because my processor wouldnt be able to handle that.  I know this was possible with ffsplit in the past but that software is HELLA outdated now.  Or maybe Ill just forget that I ever had a twitch channel.  Its not very likely that they will actually click through to my youtube from there anyway which is the main reason I would want to livestream nowadays.Of course if I get good enough then twitch is obviously more viewer potential.,NewTubers,d964t4i,1,t5_2ujnz

As far as audio quality goes its not too bad but I feel like youre being limited by your program sounds like Discord? which is lower quality audio then you would get from other VOIPs like Teamspeak or something.

Hairy Advice This is what I consider our flagship series we release them whenever but I try to push the envelope with every episode. I play one character giving advice. Its current format is cold opener gt rant advice gt end skit. We try to make these  minutes long.. Weekly Show havent started this yet however our current formats only allow us to have  upload every  weeks. We are adding an unscripted weekly series to compliment our skits.

9663340,0,t3_5dfuvw,Went through it twice and all I can say is that you do talk just a little too fast so maybe slow it down a tad. And it may just be me but I felt that when you was speaking the tone was off a little and in them types of videos I feel the speaker should sound more intrigued as though they was learning this information for the first time as well. But again that just might be me perceiving your voice that way. Also I may be nitpicking but your subtitles at  seconds is too much in one line so it doesnt look clear.Other than that I really enjoyed the video and found it very informative and did personally associate with a few of the points that you made. And except for that one other point and a couple of typing mistakes your subtitles are fine for timing and understanding. Good video overall.  ,NewTubers,da47j55,1,t5_2ujnz

9682341,0,t3_5dqiqa,Absolutely do  at a time.  I made the mistake of doing bulk uploads at one point in time and some of those videos sat at  views for a long time.  When youre talking about getting a new subscriber being new isnt necessarily bad.  They could potentially be more emotionally invested in your channel if they are there from the start.  So I would just set a schedule now that you can stick with instead of uploading  videos in a day and then not uploading for a few weeks.  Consistency is key on youtube.  Also be sure to pay attention to when you are releasing the videos.  You can schedule videos ahead of time but you want to consider when your target audience will be most likely to be watching.  Some people chase peak viewership times for when they want to release their videos but I like to be slightly before peak viewership times.  Early morning uploads didnt always work for me so I switched to afternoon.,NewTubers,da6jwo4,4,t5_2ujnz

9882298,0,t1_davnp2z,Ohh!! Now thats a completely different story since I know your point of view ! You completely changed my mind ! I didnt know that in your opinion dislikes are meant to improve  now thats something else  In my mind  I thought you meant it as  garbage  stop making videos  as dislikes generally portrays that . In that case  there is no longer use of debate as I completely understand for what purpose you dislike videos  Just a friendly advice  what you told me right now  dont forget to tell it to people because they could misinterpret it !   the problem with being nice is that you dont know how to improve and this subreddit is about improving your content. As I said before  I completely agree with this !  I disliked your video and left a mean comment Dont worry  I didnt mind at all it actually made me happy  the content and the video which simply put was bad  Dont worry  I know it was bad and it was purposely made bad  Now that we cleared things up  I wish you all the best for your channel and I hope the people who disliked your videos because of your harsh criticism will cease doing so because it doesnt bring anything . Ps  I forgot to tell you that I dropped a like for your club penguin video when it came out . I laughed my ass off when you had to call your mum for the club penguin activation email . Keep doing what you do ! ,NewTubers,davoqpf,3,t5_2ujnz

9888903,0,t3_5h0hqh,Hello. Thanks for you time.Ive got two videos. I believe that Ive put lots of effort into them but you be the judge.I do Commentary and Joke videos but Ive yet to upload my awaiting videos which focus more on criticismcommentary.Channel is found here I did my part by hosting the other criticism post.

9892444,0,t3_5h2a5g,Hey there Denning welcome to the community. Thats actually a really great goal and theres definitely a market for it. As for the subreddit dont forget to go through the rules so you understand them. Theres also a lot of resources  if you go through the MasterLink list so hopefully it helps you out.,NewTubers,dax0bqd,1,t5_2ujnz
9892705,0,t1_dawyg6v,Well in my humble opinion nobody should be calling out anybody.  This is going to be a community where we have people that are posting only out of selfinterest.  In fact thats how I the guy who took the place over in May and has not to too my own horn had a hand in almost every major change this place has ever seen found my way here!  Thats how Moriarty found his way here thats how Wes found his way here thats THE reason were all here!  At some point everybody is going to be selfish on NewTubers.  Weve long ago accepted that because being selfish gets you nothing here.  The selfish ones either adapt once they see that theyre not getting a boost or go somewhere else.  The ones who adapt tend to become contributing members of our community that are here to help everyone grow in some way.Usually and I dont want to generalize here those that we get consistent complaints from are the ones that refuse to accept the house rules that come with a place like this  a place with a thousand new subscribers every few weeks where everybody comes and goes often misunderstanding the point of the place.  You can see it from the anonymous messages OP has linked.  People who think the place is awful for new users dont check out the lengthy podcasts that are put up every other week dedicated to building a YouTube base or the probably dozen Tutorial Tuesday threads at this point that weve got going or anything in that regard.  People who get slapped with a HNR flair are never slapped with one on first offense and most likely are on their third if not more because were probably too lenient I can personally promise that.  So on and so forth.But anyway back to my point nobody is at fault most of the time when somebodys complaining about a community like NewTubers.  There are so many different types of people here for so many different reasons that pinning it back on any one is pretty unfair.  ublueeyes has some validity in his qualms and some things we will legitimately never be able to fix to everybodys satisfaction like say Critiques! but when the complaints come from a place of malice rather than say an ideas thread or a PMd suggestion you tend to see this sort of negativity bubble out of control and then the entire argument quickly gets lost in a sea of people yelling at one another.  Thats why Id much prefer ideas rather than the usual blame somebody else thread we get every two or three months.  Anyway Im digressing a bit forgive me if Im a tad all over the place  just woke up from a nap and saw this post so my mind isnt back to fully functioning yet!,NewTubers,dax1jrk,3,t5_2ujnz

You have to have a passion for it because unless your videos are incredible they wont get much attention at first.I found posting to specific subreddits where your material will be appreciated helps.

On the critique side of things I think there were some moments of dead air that could have been cut while you were talking but i understand If thats what you intended the feel to be artistically. Also Just a little bit more enthusiasm in your voice would make the video top notch and those are really all that I can say that can be improved from what I saw.Ps. the manbun is hypeyour homie from Ottawa,NewTubers,db1clxu,2,t5_2ujnz

9973955,0,t1_db7jgdn,First I like your reviews. Great work you did a nice job of quickly going though a lot a content and focus on some of the most important ones. It did feel a little long but that might be because of the amount of content. Some nit picky things are you seem almost annoyed at time while your words seem to say that you enjoy the movie your talking about. I dont want to say change the way you talk P but be aware of your inflection. second there was a song in the background ? question markI couldnt tell if it was the videos sound or you put a song in but it was just audible enough to keep pulling my attention away from your words. Playing more with specific sound byte from the animations might help with that and the pacing. Great job though Keep it up!,NewTubers,db7mthi,2,t5_2ujnz
9979222,0,t3_5ii6gh,We use Adobe After Effects for the intro and Photoshop or Illustrator for the channel art.I think a good intro is SHORT If someone watches a bunch of your videos you dont want them getting annoyed at the length of your intro. Were talking  seconds max. Get the name in there obviously with some basic animation. And it has to have character! Whatever personality youre presenting to the audience for your show should come through in the intro.,NewTubers,db8bkem,3,t5_2ujnz
9982558,0,t3_5ii6gh,I use paint tool sai GIMP and ms paint cause im dirt poor XD paint tool sai is great for graphics especially if you have a tablet cause it has a ton of cool features including a stabilizer!! for tablet. Its also free if you know how to do an infinite trial. unfortunately they dont have a text option so thats why I bring up MS paint occasionally. But otherwise it is pretty full featured for graphic creation. GIMP is better for editing already made graphics ex a photograph and is free forever without having to do anything. I dont like as much as PTS for creating images from scratch but its still usable for those purposes.I have mostly used movie maker to edit videos and make intros but I recently downloaded lightworks as recommended by several other newtubers. Its a huuuuuuge step up. If youre on a budget and cant afford adobe programs id definitely try out lightworks. You have to register an account but otherwise its free As for your last question what makes a good intro to me isnt necessarily high production value but moreso personality and swiftness. I hate sitting through long intros that are only the channels name in ultra HD for like  seconds especially if the image quality of the actual video is no where near HD. Its even worse when paired with dubstep its become something of a trope on youtube. I will immediately click off a video if the intro has all of the above.I would much rather see a unique memorable logo for  seconds than any premade nonsense. A good example that comes to mind is Roosterteeth.tldr paint tool sai GIMP ms paint and lightworks for programs keep your intro short and sweet.,NewTubers,db8r7k2,2,t5_2ujnz

10230525,0,t1_dc3ofrx,That was really calming. I enjoyed it a lot! subbed. Maybe in the future you could do more videos about it feeding? My girlfriends brother has one and he feeds it cubes of these little red worms and its pretty entertaining to watch. Good music! Id love to see more videos of that. Maybe some more of it swimming or from a further out distance too! I know theyre pretty stoic animals and dont swim a lot but that would be cool to get footage off.

You talk about what the video is going to be about for the first minute just leaving it on the title screen. Id say either streamline what you want to say by scripting at least that first bit out or start playing the game and continue chatting about how its gonna be a calm lets play. Other than that it was a nice video. ,NewTubers,dc4um9g,1,t5_2ujnz

At  cmon look at this crosshair placement you get dont get  adr playing like that but I digress. Theres so many series like this however I think the popular ones are like what NickBunyun?

10302085,0,t1_dcbqr1f,An old desk lamp or something with a white LED bulb could work if you can place it right. It also allows you to move it around. For now what you have looks good. With tine you could try some stand alone lights what ever you have lying around and see how they add to the lighting. Like when youre cutting the carrots to add a light behind the camera to brighten up the image.See what works for you. A white led spotlight should be able to get those pretty decently priced on a stand would probably work well for most of the shots.

10329793,0,t3_5nw7pv,For the viewers if you mean pulling them from just search results Id say tagging and having an interesting title and thumbnail.

10338755,0,t1_dcfoxvc,What Worked  The content. Really enjoyed that youre taking a historical approach to some of these games.  The pictures you used and the names you have on the screen. Very good and keeps things fresh. Things would have been stale if we were looking at gameplay footage that had little or no relevance.  Great thumbnail.  Audio and video quality.  Some Improvements  Over the course of the video there were several instances where there was a blank screen either a white screen or a black screen. Make sure theres always something there. It looked like something was a little late to the editing party and there was a gap of nothing in that space. Make sure theres always something on screen even if it doesnt line up with the punch line yet have something.  The title. The title was clear as to the topic but Im a little confused why Uncharted  was listed. It was every bit of Tomb Raider as well. Why not mention both or none at all? The current title makes it seem like the entire episode is about Uncharted .  ,NewTubers,dcfyg06,1,t5_2ujnz

10383263,0,t3_5opgfb,The mic is definitely great audio. The intro wasnt all too bad nor was the outro. The transitioning could be a lot smoother and your other weaknesses could be sorted out over time. My main concern is that with this length and style it seems more suited for podcasting rather than video because you didnt show much visuals that add to the topic. What you can do is maybe have each other sit at the ends of a table and alternate with two different cameras to show  person at a time.,NewTubers,dcl09ig,1,t5_2ujnz

10431379,0,t1_dcqfn8n,I think your transitions between locations have really improved since your Chicago trip  nice clear and snappy. Though there were a couple times I thought you might have rushed through a highlight like when I was expecting a closer look at the statue of Sejong or when you were showing that whole musicmarching routine. I was a little confused at first why you were going straight from one flight to another I assumed that the beginning few shots took you from America to Korea rather than from Chicago to New York and with the whole  days later thing I thought youd skipped over the whole trip. A little bit of sound editing would go a long way for you the volume was somewhat inconsistent throughout so I found myself periodically turning the volume up and down. That being said I think your content is improving and youre at a beautiful location  seriously youre so lucky to be able to go on two trips so close together and one so far away and thats a big draw for me.,NewTubers,dcqgsgj,2,t5_2ujnz

Consider cutting out the wait time between moves it is kind of like load times.. no one like load times.Thanks.,NewTubers,dcqt342,1,t5_2ujnz

10441793,0,t1_dcrjhjb,Hey dude!The strengths of your channel Your logo is good but it could be reformatted so it fits the whole thumbnail. from what I could hear of the commentary its audio quality is good but quiet. What could be improved Your audio is quite quiet in your lets play of fallout . It would help for you to turn that up or try to speak louder.  You should work on your thumbnails and channel banner as right now there is no sense of a joint working art format or sense of a recognizable brand. Good luck!,NewTubers,dcrnn4x,1,t5_2ujnz
10441891,0,t1_dcrjo6f,Thanks for the kind word EasyCooler i appreciate it.

Im really happy you enjoyed the video Haha dont feel guilty its just my opinion maybe other people love them !Damn you guys are really awesome  You guys tell me that my style reminds you of TheRadbrad so I can only be happy considering that he is a big youtuber D I agree that my channel definitly needs some new art .Im still thinking about putting on a facecam . The reason why im still hesitating is that I would love the viewers to share the experience with me and sometimes a facecam can be distracting but at the same time watching someone play the game and completely freak out can be funny too ...Thank you for pointing that out  I did some post audio but it seems like I still need some work . I was really thinking about cutting some parts so thank you for sharing your opinion ! I definitely some end screens !

10579541,0,t3_5rh86o,Okay first of all the biggest thing that bothered me was the way you two were framed.It is best to be completely in the center theres too much space to the left. The camera also seems to be slightly tilted. That was something that really bothered me.Your gimmick is to be sitting on a couch. Thats fine and dandy except your viewers cant see the couch! Sit in the middle of the couch have your camera straight and keep the space to the sides even. That will help you incredibly. The lighting is fine audio is okay your content has improved but you still have a ways to go. Try cutting down your video length a little. You should aim for  minutes at this point.Otherwise just keep doing what youre doing and keep improving!,NewTubers,dd77494,2,t5_2ujnz

10601150,0,t1_dd9ey32,Hey Im a few minutes into this video and I have to say...  minutes is LONG for any kind of video on YouTube especially a gaming video. Clip it to around half that or something more coherent like a best of montage or something. Your conversation isnt bad but it doesnt particularly want me to keep watching either. You need to be either funny interesting or provide information for first timersthose who may not be as adept at said game with your commentary and this video seems to lack any of those. Seems like youre a good group just not something Id choose to watch especially for  minutes.

10634926,0,t1_ddcsr4g,There was a response that was since deleted before I was able to reply that mentioned the PC requirements of rendering at higher resolutions so just to clarify.Processor IntelR CoreTM iK CPU  .GHz  Mhz  Cores  Logical ProcessorsInstalled Physical Memory RAM . GB DDR I dont recall the speed on what I have offhand and dont want to restart to check the bios.Gfx GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX Dedicated Storage .TBThe storage I understand can become a very big issue very quickly if you want to retain copies of your work offline so what are your views on maintaining copies vs letting YouTube be your online storage?But with that all said Im confident that my system can handle rendering  or better at a full fps. Do you think it could fill a niche to go full k since its still a burgeoning market on YouTube with typically only the high sub channels doing it?Either way the primary reason for this post is not just for my own use but to get the information easily accessible to anyone looking to start their channel so please feel free to add any other useful information or links to free software that could help new YouTubers or advice on any other paid programs are good and for which types of recording or editing and so on. Keep the information flowing.I know that not everybody can drop a few thousand bucks on their equipment so if you have any information about cheap but good parts peripherals or even software that would also be a boon.I myself prefer Newegg for instance but most of my knowledge is in hardware not editing software. Are there sites that offer the Humble Bundle of editing software?Windows Movie Maker WMM is a notably oft suggested program however it is of note that WMM is no longer supported by Microsoft and therefore you can not download it directly from them anymore which takes an intro program to video editing out of the equation for many. Are there any other overly simplified clip splicing style editors out there?Im still doing a lot of my own research as well but Ive noticed a lack of having that information in one place which brings me back full circle to the reason for creating this thread.And as for the timing I know it will take a while to learn everything I need to which is why Im setting aside several weeks before I even think about uploading my first video.I know that its not something thats necessary to rush into expecting to make a bunch of money on it which brings me to another important thing frequently mentioned.Patience.Youve gotta have it in order to make it as a YouTuber.

10719887,0,t3_5tbxi5,Initial reactions... Good intro. Nice vibe and your voice over is good. On par with the BIG vloggers. Nice music selection. Inter dispersed very well between talking moments and scenery broll. You almost made this video  mins long. The YouTube algorithm promotes videos over  more so keep that in mind for the future. Some advice on audio volumes. Import your voiceovers into a single file in whatever audio program. They all have a plugin called Normalize or Compress. This will average out your volumes so they sound consistent.  Good vlog man. i enjoyed it. It was editted in a way that kept it interesting and didnt drag on. Keep it up. ,NewTubers,ddlodt8,2,t5_2ujnz

10853455,0,t1_ddytojf,I watched your most recent upload. You seem to be engaging but also a little monotone at points. You also talk really fast. You could try slowing down pausing or even rephrase what youve just said and reiterate to your audience. Since you channel is mostly based on you talking youve really got to focus on your voice and personality. Also some parts seemed a bit boring and strung out. You can fix this with some simple editing. Cut out the slow bits to make sure your audience never gets bored. In terms of you voice one of the ways you can practice is find something online to read. If you like scary stories there are literally thousands of creepy pastas you can try. Pick one of these stories and record yourself reading it. Really get into it. Practice voice acting and practice on playing the role of the character to which youre reading. You dont have to upload this to your channel but you can save the audio file and critique it or have others critique it. This can ensure that you are comfortable publicly speaking and all around better improve your vocal personality as a whole.,NewTubers,ddzggqc,1,t5_2ujnz

10865231,0,t3_5v9z9y,Hello! I enjoyed your video D there are a few things I would suggest. First I think you should have an intro. Something simple like hi my name is billy and today I will talk about blah blah. Lets begin with number .... That way the viewer has a better understanding of what to expect. Also while I like the music it didnt fit with the overall tone of the video. Youre talking about massive volcanoes but with sweet and calm guitar music. I think that something slightly more epic would be more appropriate like something with drums and bass. I really liked your outro  keep it up! Peace D,NewTubers,de0o6nc,1,t5_2ujnz

Your personality is great and it shows.My suggestion would be to work on your video description a little more and try to fill it out by adding a few more keywords. I would mention that Nintendo Switch is a new gaming console if new gaming console is something that your audience would search for and maybe some of the specs of the new system.  You also might want to put the proscons list in the description.Also if other people in your space especially big channels also reviewed the Switch Id link them up in the description as well.  ,NewTubers,de66qf8,1,t5_2ujnz

10966533,0,t1_deb3vdd,To start off I am not quite fond of your intro. It feels a little bit cheesy to me I would suggest hopping right into the meat of your video with you introducing yourself. Secondly I think its important for you to decide who you target audience is. Currently it seems like its just for your own documentation these home videos. Theres nothing particularly exciting about watching children play at home but thats fine for a home video. If you want this to be interesting to others Id suggest only filming on special days when youre going places. Or maybe even create fun little challenges for your children to dosolve. That could be pretty entertaining to watch. Youre definitely off to a good start and I appreciate how wellspoken you are...a lot of vloggers just go uhhhhh.,NewTubers,deb4cn8,1,t5_2ujnz

11005754,0,t3_5x5ujh,Right off the bat I got  things that show help. First establish the idea before you parody it. You gonna lose people who dont get its a parody because you start with the Pro Trump side and people will click away if they dont agree. And secondly audio quality. You need a little better mic but more so you need sound dampeners to kill that echo. If you watch someone like Philip Defranco hes easy to watch because hes easy to hear. Just my thoughts. Overall seems like you got good content. Good luck!,NewTubers,defgyzi,2,t5_2ujnz

They tend to be pretty quickpaced with a little bit of comedy in the mix  though Im working towards making sure theyre consistently followable and Im trying to incorporate more scenes and fewer images that are puns on whatever word I happen to be saying since I think slowing down the images will let people focus more on what Im saying.

11438503,0,t3_63agcp,This is going to be a long one so buckle up Jade! Btw I love the way Canadians say about food and sorry. I worked in an outlet mall after my freshman year of college and a lot of Canadians came in and those words are numero uno on my list of words I love to hear Canadians say.My first advice for promotion might be different than others but I would say to not promote your videos at first. Upload at your own pace for a little try and setup a schedule and stick to that schedule for at least a few videos. After that you can start to promote yourself and your videos and instead of people going to your channel and watching one or two videos of yours they will be able to see that you are dedicated to uploading and theyll either subscribe or keep watching a bunch of your videos and then subscribe.The issue I see with a lot of new youtubers is they try to promote their channel when they only have one or two videos. How am I supposed to know if I should subscribe if you only uploaded two videos? My subscriptions are a resource that is in high demand and they are nonrenewable! You dont just give subscriptions to anyone right? Work on your videos work on your channel and then after all of that you can look to promotion your videos. As for where to promote I would start with your facebook instagram and twitter. As a basic white girl you probably have all those things right? Start there you most likely? have family and friends that would be willing to watch and share your stuff. Get them involved in challenge videos get them on your channel with tutorials. As much as we like to believe that we are the best at everything our friends are better at some things so invite them on the show to showcase their talents in tutorial videos and stuff. This makes it easier on you as a content creator because you have someone to talk with and it makes it easier to get them to share your video around because they are featured in it PI tracked your youtube down and watched your first video you certainly opened up a lot more as the video went on and I think having a friend on with you would help bring out your personality more so try and get some more people on. As far as editing goes it isnt the best I think you could do better clipping things around and stuff but youll learn to do that better as time goes on. I wish you the best of luck moving forward and if you stick with it and dedicate some time to learning different techniques you could make some dope videos ,NewTubers,dfsjkpr,1,t5_2ujnz

Would be nicer on the eyes if maybe you had a  light setup on yourself so you are lit and separate from your background. Currently its lacking some lighting dynamics is all.

11445123,0,t1_dft9g8d,I had no idea what the video was about until I reached like . I wasnt sure if this is a vlog or a fake documentary. You should really make an intro so people know what your video is about. So Im going to critique this as a vlog. You keep the conversation going and you explain where youre at and what the place is about which is cool almost nostalgic. Filming is good I felt like the editing was weird though in terms of color correction and frame shots like that one at  was just weird and out of place. Try adding text in your video like the location of the place youre at you tarted it well by adding your friends names so continue with that style. Also dont forget to make an outdo telling you subscribers when youll upload your next video like comment etcGood luck.,NewTubers,dftam0r,1,t5_2ujnz

Ill tryStarting out dont tell your viewers to like and subscribe before the video. Ive actually had people click off my videos because I use to do this. My analytics showed that right after saying hey if you enjoy like and subscribe people clicked off. Instead try to encourage people to want to see me. At the end of the video say hey if you liked this give it a thumbs up!. Ive seen more success with channels that say things like Ill see you next week or Ill see you next time because then people feel like theyre in an ongoing series. I do like the personal feel in the intro tho. Thats niceThe video quality could be better but we all start from somewhere. My first video was also recorded on my webcam lol. You have a great personality! Maybe some more background on the thing your unboxing would help viewers understand what it is. Give some information about the company too. Make it informative You do spend a lot of time on each thing which I like but other viewers could click off short attention.

Dont post them yourself but use www.ifttt.com to automate stuff. Then you can post extra and personal stuff manually to really get people interested. On Twitter just follow some people that follow other Youtubers and if they follow you back strike up a conversation. Its not about just making an account on social media you need to have a presence there talk to people look up popular tags etc. I base my following on twitter and I have about  followers there. When I want to post a picture of myself for example I post it on Twitter and then I post it on instagram which lets me share it to Facebook and Tumblr by just pressing two buttons.,NewTubers,dg48ibd,1,t5_2ujnz

11552912,0,t1_dg5im7d,Yeah let me just learn to draw then animate then pull money from no where to hire actors then find a company to produce it or get a team to animate it for me so I can put it out weekly on YouTube. Thats sarcasm by the way. I actually am very grateful for that response. It makes a bunch of sense but there are so many channels that do it I just thought I could too. Guess I shouldnt. Maybe Ill try making my own anime could be fun. ,NewTubers,dg5iya8,1,t5_2ujnz

11557904,0,t1_dg5x82u,Im kinda torn between a keemstarPhilip Defranco style of show. I think several topics in one video might be a bit better for the overall flow of the video. And I ageee about the background it could use a bit more personalization. Also the enthusiasm thing is something I was afraid of. While recording it seemed fine but upon looking back at it I realized that I wasnt quite enthusiastic enough. Thats definitely something I need to be a bit more aware of while recording. Thanks for the advice I really appreciate it. ,NewTubers,dg63cd8,1,t5_2ujnz

11592275,0,t3_65ftmn,Ive just started a channel not long ago like  weeks ago and I share your sentiment. I was highly motivated when I made the first few but its dying down cause Im literally getting no views. But I motivate myself by thinking about that when someone does see it they might like it. Video editing also provokes my creativeness and I find that fun so I just think about editing when I need motivation. Stage fright I feel is something EVERY Youtuber had at one point. If you watch Jacksepticeyes older videos he was kinda awkward and with more videos made he became more and more confident. I also feel a lot more confident after making a few videos myself. So its just a matter of doing it more and getting use to it.Dont be afraid to upload something you feel like isnt good enough. This is cliched but you become better by learning through mistakes. This subreddit is dedicated to helping small Youtubers succeed so get out there and make some good stuff.,NewTubers,dg9zqu3,1,t5_2ujnz
11594053,0,t1_dga6vsi,I get what you mean. I only give feedback to those who at least put some effort into making the thread. I expect people to have some opinion in their own content before asking for others. ,NewTubers,dga703d,1,t5_2ujnz
11594487,0,t1_dga8dk4,In order to use a clip you need the use to fall under fair use.  Putting the border around it or flipping the image will make it harder for YouTube to spot that its a copyrighted clip when they compare it against their database of copyrighted material.  I would say reading about fair use and what constitutes fair use is a must if you plan to use other peoples work in your YouTube videos.,NewTubers,dga8s32,1,t5_2ujnz

11621246,0,t1_dgd9r2q,Hello mate great thing right here! You got my sub! maybe I will need one free song in the future! About the channel I dont like the thing that you have the same thumbnail and the same background in every video! It looks effortless nobody likes to see that ! The music is great u can sell this very well people is always looking for songs like this for their videos and I like how you kept the videos short! keep it up with the good work!,NewTubers,dgda240,1,t5_2ujnz
11625897,0,t1_dgdsq50,Thats an incredible work I think the biggest key is promoting finding the good subreddit to share your videos is really important. Ill try my best to find the good subreddits to share my vids! Uploading once a day must be really hard tho Im impressed.I do this to I create a playlist for each different categories but it doesnt seem to work nobody watch the playlist. ,NewTubers,dgdt2u1,1,t5_2ujnz
11630740,0,t3_65yxyy,Oh yeah I started watching YouTube when it first launched. The effort required to succeed on YouTube is exponentially more. Honestly what bothers me more about big YouTubers is their lack of support for smaller channels that used to be a big deal back in the day and now whenever someone gets successful they just forget about everyone else its sad. But hey what can ya do? I have the mind set right now that Im very confident I will succeed Ive worked my ass off for over two years but it means Ill actually be grateful when things work out and I plan on highlighting smaller channels whenever I find ones I really enjoy. Thats my advice no harm in the occasional rant but use that motivation and when you start getting tons of views know that you really earned it like those older guys didnt. Keep on keeping on brother ,NewTubers,dgecuy5,1,t5_2ujnz
11630830,0,t1_dgecr1c,Yup I get you! I probably wouldnt be so bitter if my channel was at least GROWING even if at a snails pace... That way I would know im at least crawling along towards that goal of being a big youtuber. But I go through periods of being dead stuck at a fixed number with no views or subs coming in... And its super discouraging when I know that the big Youtubers I watch gain THOUSANDS of subs per day. Shit if I gained even  subs per day consistently id be on cloud .,NewTubers,dged865,1,t5_2ujnz
11632895,0,t1_dgej7y5,Hey I learned something today! I like this video a lot and the intro reminded me of Bill Nye. I would just try to shorten the video to closer to five minutes. Also try to look at the lens when youre speaking as it gets distracting when you can tell that people are looking elsewhere. ,NewTubers,dgelnhv,1,t5_2ujnz
11644723,0,t1_dgfvfgv,Great video Grain of Rice! I feel you summed your strengths up very well. My only complaint is that maybe you could do with a little script improvement  particularly at the end I felt it could have been a bit stronger. e.g. let gratitude overflow you would sound more appropriate by saying overflow within you and the very end bit says take in a moment... missed opportunity to reference the video title! Take in...NOW would have been very dramatic and fitting P Anyhow thats just my opinion. I think this was a nice little vid!,NewTubers,dgfxykw,1,t5_2ujnz
11646684,0,t3_6661w9,Awesome congrats on your success . What ever your doing your doing it right. Im stuck at  subs Im working on more content.,NewTubers,dgg5yu2,2,t5_2ujnz

11651523,0,t1_dgglm30,I loved your video.  I thought your sound quality was good and that is one of the primary things I look for.  I thought you had a solid intro and did a great job of explaining what the video was about.  I actually laughed out loud during the intro too.I appreciated the nice shots of the finished product.  Nice and artistic with the PC being outside.  I wasnt crazy however about the time lapse build.  I couldnt really tell what you were doing and it was  you running around.  I would have preferred close up cut shots in normal time of what you were actually doing. Putting in the motherboard adding the CPU cable management etc.Again the challenge of a tech video what OS did you load on it? Did you spend the full ? Where you under or over?  I think that your target audience is detail oriented and would like to know.  Also I enjoyed what YOU thought of your build when you mentioned overclocking it. The only other thing would have been to make the graphics of what you purchased and where pop a little more.  The graphics look great but sometimes they blended into the background and were a little hard to read. I love the concept of what your video is doing! I think you did great  on executing as well.,NewTubers,dggpq9e,1,t5_2ujnz

11677842,0,t1_dgjlwz6,Perfect amount of harsh  Id rather get one good response like this that lays it all out for me than a bunch of oversappy nice video you did a good job with xyz.In the future Ill try to explain things a bit better and put some more thought into each step instead of just coasting through it. Ill do each step and as I do it Ill explain why were doing it and how it affects the outcome.,NewTubers,dgjp7gu,1,t5_2ujnz

11718882,0,t1_dgocwka,First off thanks for watching the XIII one was a bit of a interesting choice.. its the oldest one of all of them and on camera introductions have since been abandoned so lighting wont be an issue anymore.The thumbnails I never thought about but ultimately I dont think they need to have test in the thumb as they always come displayed with titles anyway.. though Id be interested to know if people prefer text on the thumbnail in general.Ive had a few posts for feedback on weather to cut videos up and I think thats the one area where Im going against the general consensus as Im aiming these at the types of people who prefer longer reviews.. I dont like to cut stuff up as it feels like its pushing for more views. If someone wants to take a break id video youtubes savewatch coding works well enough now that they can continue later on but I dont expect people with short attention spans to watch themthanks for the feedback,NewTubers,dgod458,1,t5_2ujnz
11720813,0,t3_676fc9,Hey man first off I think your vids are great! good quality. As far as your banner something maybe that is really unique to your channel and tells people what your content is like. My personal favorite thing to use is canva.com to make ANY art I need. It has size formats for every social media online from profile pics on fb to banners and thumbnails on yt! try it out maybe! Oh! and I really like your name. simple but rolls off the tongue nicely,NewTubers,dgol0ij,1,t5_2ujnz
11721522,0,t3_677yiw,Its just something you have to go out and learn man. I remember when I was  and first started getting into editing. I got Sony Vegas and that was my main program til I was .

11784971,0,t1_dgve5lh,The starting ish seconds was a bit weird. Cause it was just a picture prolly needs some movement or music. The game seemed pretty terrifying but honestly I have no clue whats going on in the game.A bit of a small recap or something woulda been cool kinda briefly tell me what this game is about or some of the mechanics that are going on. At some point you mentioned something about a story and the dudes wife being taken so.  Thats kind of a point of interest. Best not to assume just because Im watching part  means that I watched your part . Thats all I got in the critique department atm. Dont wanna seem like Im tearing the vid down. Quality was vood. Game is a bit dark visually for my taste but seemed overall interesting.,NewTubers,dgvv5tr,1,t5_2ujnz
11790990,0,t1_dgwjghz,From an editing standpoint I liked the shot glasses down in the corner. Effective way for your audience to keep track. I know you put it up in order of how you introduced yourselves which is fine but I think it would be helpful for newcomers if it matched up with how you were in frame. Just so I dont need to compare faces to keep track of whos getting the most wasted. I also might suggest adding something to the shot glasses so that theyre not transparent. It worked for most of the video but I didnt like that when you died more of the background peeked in. A minor gripe. You guys seem like you have good chemistry which is great. Mic quality could be better but I understand thats not always an option in the beginning. Last thing is I think you couldve cropped the footage slightly better. Mostly because theres a good chunk of dead space above the  of you that could be taken up by the game instead. Ultimately I like the  of you as a trio and also like your channel name in general. Keep it up with the creative video ideas but dont kill your Livers too much alright ,NewTubers,dgwjr5d,2,t5_2ujnz
11791754,0,t3_68941u,First of all the actual music is really good. Seems like pretty high quality stuff considering its free. I see you only have five subs Im definitely gonna sub. But in order to get that up I would just post your videos in various places on the internet and market them subreddits Facebook twitter etc. The front page of your channel needs some work. I had to click on videos to find your uploaded videos. Upon initially clicking on your page it says nothing is here which is strange. Either way the music is great.

11803557,0,t1_dgxuv19,I use VSDC as well. Its not that user friendly but it does a good job. I would suggest hunting down a copy of version  instead of using the latest release though since they put waveforms behind a pay wall and those make editing much easier.,NewTubers,dgxz2w8,1,t5_2ujnz
