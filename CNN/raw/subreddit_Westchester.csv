2378526,0,t3_2mlkuh,JoLea Auto Center is right on main st. in downtown Peekskill. My family has been bringing our cars there for years. Gary owns it now but weve been going since his father owned it.

2853549,0,t1_cno8l2o,Wait were you connecting to the hot spot it made or your router the traditional way? In order to make sure your bandwidth isnt affected the new hotspot created is very limited speedwise. So if you connected via the way with the login page and not via your actual SSID you would have slow speeds ironically to protect you.,Westchester,cnsg6bq,1,t5_2rqqt

4338201,0,t1_cs5bhvu, The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development is overreaching by telling Westchester where they must build low income housing. These matters where always left up to local governments but now the Feds insist on asserting their power over all local affairs. Westchester has already met the quota of low income housing required.  It doesnt make sense for Westchester to pay to subsidize low income housing in high property value areas. Feds are taking a lot of money out of the community and then holding it hostage because Westchester wont bow to the Feds every dictate.,Westchester,csen86t,2,t5_2rqqt
4471030,0,t3_3cce45,A lot of fun but much more corporate than it used to be.

7407684,0,t3_4gqwrp,How difficult is it to not stop your car in the middle of a crossing? Just like if you are in traffic at an intersection you are not supposed to drive into the crossing if there is a chance you will get stuck in the middle. Good thing they were able to get out of the car in time. ,Westchester,d2k7ejs,4,t5_2rqqt

8018711,0,t3_4ozpv5,White Plains for sure. Your commute to work would be super easy. There are lots of options for rentals and you have the city so finding stuff new dry cleaner restaurants shopping will be simple. The only bummer I see about WP is the no street parking overnight. So either make sure you pick a building with a lot or one that is close to a muni lot. And dont forget to factor that parking pass into your budget. I think I am paying around  month for a muni lot overnight pass. ,Westchester,d4hdm4w,2,t5_2rqqt
