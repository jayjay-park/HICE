5104344,0,t1_cv19c8g,Which is fine but youre stating that as if Kyle was always going to come back in or Sumlin eventually decided he should come back in and then those things happened as part of some plan. Thats not what happened. Every indication aside form Spavs little anecdote about chin up buddy! youll get another chance! was that they had gone all in on Kyler until the injury.,12thMan,cv19i91,1,t5_2wjlu
5256650,0,t1_cvjlxfc,It could be either or both. I havent examined it close enough to say. I think I always just assumed he must have a quick release or he wouldnt have received the star prostyle rating since it is so central to being that type of QB.,12thMan,cvjm4m4,3,t5_2wjlu

5360715,0,t3_3od60j,I am happy to see this title and the sentiment.  This sub does not have a bunch of homers in it and the team needs to go into this game knowing they could lose. Knowing that they are expected to lose.How many times have we watched football games where the team finally decides to wake up in the fourth quarter and play some football?  How many times have we screamed at the poor TV WHAT THE FUCK? IF YOU ASSHOLES HAD PLAYED LIKE THIS FROM THE BEGINNING WE COULD HAVE WON THIS GAME?! Teams that play to win that play hard play better.The flipside is true and Ive said it a thousand times overconfidence kills teams.  Emotional exhaustion kills teams too. The year we beat Alabama they had just come off of a huge emotionally exhausting win.I dont think Bamas win over Arkansas is as big a win for them.  I think they breathed a huge sigh of relief though.  A hard game that they won will subtly reinforce the preconception that they win games simply because.We can compare Xs and Os all day long. I think a rational analysis simply gives Bama a small edge  like we see in the spread today.  Note as of this writing covers.com has AampM at . The real difference will be who shows up to play?  There is no way to quantify that or predict that.  I could see AampM coming into this game far cockier than they should.  Weve done a good job at controlling our attitude this year lets hope that continues.  We dont want the coaches to dampen the teams ardor. Its a tough balancing act.I dont have the same feeling about Alabama but I hope the players will secretly emotionally rebel against Sabans demand for emotional control.  I know that sounds ridiculous. But the teams emotional mindset will be such a huge factor in this game.  The Bama win over Arkansas is a huge relief for me  if theyd lost they would be out for blood this week.Both teams could win. The smart money is on Bama.  But the smarter money wouldnt bet on this game.  The Ags have played at the level of their opponents all season.  Lets hope that thats just one of those things and not telling about the quality of our team.This has been a very exciting season so far.  A gutwrenching nailbiting season at times.  Each game is getting more significant than the last.  Each opponent is getting tougher than the last.  The anticipation is killing me.  There is going to be a lot of hard analysis this week. I think the difference will come in the intangibles  who wants to win more who wants to play harder who can play better in the face of adversity. Its not possible to make a prediction about that.,12thMan,cvww4a3,7,t5_2wjlu
5410904,0,t3_3p5abv,allen needs to make his throws but hes in such a hole and has never had to work on the kind of throws suddenly required cause we babied him with bubbles jet sweeps and toss up home runs all season,12thMan,cw3awmk,2,t5_2wjlu

5486080,0,t1_cwcnzz1,Youve made the point several times on this sub that Kyle Allen is the guy for the job and that giving Kyler Murray playing time is a terrible idea. But based on the way hes played the last  games do you still think that? Kyle Allen played horribly. The play calling was bad but Kyle was making terrible throws and missing easy completions.At this point is Kyler Murray not worth exploring as an option?,12thMan,cwcwbn8,1,t5_2wjlu
5671749,0,t3_3sqjyt,We have a very deep team that can shoot the three ball and rebound. Hogg looked great. Didnt even have Jalen or the new sg eubanks. This is appears to be the best aggie basketball team in a few years and our expectations are low. If we make the tournament and win a game I would consider this season a success.,12thMan,cx04xb9,2,t5_2wjlu
5683730,0,t3_3syfi5,It should be Allen but it will be Murray. Sumlin hasnt declared the QB competition open again and if he stuck with Allen through the  quarters of shame hell stick with Murray while things are somewhat even. ,12thMan,cx1meql,7,t5_2wjlu

5857569,0,t1_cxmy5uc,Spav hasnt done shit with three very talented quarterbacks. Why would you want him to stay at all? If honestly be ok with giving a chance to an up and comer rather than keep Spav. And you know if we have another year like this Sumlin is gonna be in the hot seat. Get rid of Spav and maybe Sumlin can get this team back in shape.,12thMan,cxngf3q,8,t5_2wjlu

7556837,0,t1_d30x2p9,The positive is ...Last offseason the coaches gushed about his work ethic and progress. If he pushes those around him to be better then this will have been a huge success. I dont care if he plays but I want every bit of help our LBs can get. Plus I bet we see him on special teams. ,12thMan,d316ce8,8,t5_2wjlu

8768818,0,t3_506wud,This kills me.  Its human nature to step forward when you are excited.  You want to be as close to the action as possible.I literally can not believe that they will allow every student at every university and college and high school to stand on the bleachers except AampM. Thats simply stupid. This will go away.  They cant kick out the entire student section.  It would make AampM look stupid on Sportscenter and wed be mocked for it forever.Stand up for your rights.  Stand on the wood.  unless there is an injury or the opposing band is playing.,12thMan,d71rlkp,13,t5_2wjlu
9026791,0,t1_d7wpeod,God I hope the pass plays start clicking. It really feels like were on the cusp of a barn burning offense but a pass may be off just enough or we have a drop here or there and we get stopped or held to a field goal.

9809601,0,t3_5fjbb2,Our two biggest issues in depth are LB and OL. LB   OLB Jordan Richmond. Arrested for pot suspended indefinitely and transferred out.   OLB Polo Manukainu. Died in car accident. Would have been a RS Senior this year.   LB Michael Richardson. Career ending injury. Took cheap shots on two WV players at Liberty Bowl after career was over and Sumlin let him stay with team as student assistant. Not sure we can blame any of those on Sumlin and that was a pretty decent recruiting haul for a couple months and being a offensive oriented coach.    AJ Hilliard. Career ending injury.   Darian Claiborne. Arrested for armed robbery kicked out. TR Tommy Sanders. Played out eligibility. Hey we got a transfer at a position of need. Yay. Wasnt that good. Boo.   Brett Wade. Career ending injury  Jordan Maestro. Quit football then returned as a walk on. Didnt play this year. Dont know if he quit again. Not sure these are Sumlins fault. Two classes of LBs completely destroyed due to arrests  injuries  and death .    Otaro Alaka. Injuryprone. Has the physical tools but play hasnt always lived up to his athleticism  Josh Walker. Kicked out after domestic case with girlfriend. Was underperforming prior to that.Gotta blame Sumlin for not developing either player and for not taking more than  LBs in that class.   Richard Moore. Looked very promising after pulling his shirt last year. This year not as good. Need some weight.   Claude George. Has developed a bit and was a big contributor this year.   Landis Durham. Somehow cant crack the depth chart on this team.   Dwaine Thomas. Backup to Shaan Washington. Better be hungry next year. We are going to need him with Shaan graduating.   Riley Garner. Missed his senior year of HS with a major concussion. On team but not a contributor. At least we have bodies from this class and no one has been arrested! Just no one is SECstarting caliber.    Tyrel Dotson. Contributor as backup. Hope he develops a lot this offseason.   Mac Labhart. Splits time between football and his hair band. Only two LBs and neither is a ? Thats pretty bad. Our weakness at LB seems pretty obvious to be a combination of death Polo arrests Claiborne Walker Richmond injury Richardson Wade Maestro Hilliard and lack of development Alaka Moore Thomas. I know Golden had some red flags but Claiborne didnt. Now lets look at our OL.    Ishmael Wilson  transferred to Baylor to be closer to sick mom. Allegedly involved in gang rape.   JJ Gustafson  career ending injury  Joas Aguilar  career ending injury  Jeremiah Stuckey  graduated   Jermaine Eluemunor  starting T  Avery Gennesy  starting T  Zach Ledwick  retired from football  Koda Martin  backup  Tank Davis  backup   Connor Lanfear  starting G  Keaton Sutherland  backup G  Trevor Elbert  Career ending injury  Erik McCoy  starting C   Kellen Diesch  redshirt  Austin Anderson  backup  Riley Anderson  redshirt  Colton Prater  starting G  Ryan McCollum  redshirtSo out of  recruits at LB and OL we have   Death  Transfer due to sick mother  Arrested and kicked out or transferred out  Career ending injuries andor retirementsYou tend to expect about  of your class to not pan out. Having almost  of your class lost due to things outside your control is abnormally high. We have not had that same rate of loss at other positions. I think we were exceptionally unlucky there. I think Sumlin has also focused more on players without character issues which is why you saw us cut Alton Robinson before he got on campus. Hard for any coach to overcome issues like that. There is definitely some to put on Sumlin weak recruiting not enough recruiting really bad OL position coaches until Turner came back but we also have to realize a lot of that is out of his hands. ,12thMan,dam8rxb,4,t5_2wjlu
