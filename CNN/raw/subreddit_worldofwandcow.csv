1488539,0,t3_2aw3w3,Personally I prefer shorter videos I like being able to watch the whole video in one sitting and its sometimes hard to find  minutes to an hour to sit down and watch a video. I usually tend to put off longer videos for later and when I finally find time to watch them I sometimes dont get through the whole thing before I get an idea and want to work on that and end up closing the video before it finishes. I think with shorter episodes Id be able to keep up with the series better and find time to do the things that keep me from being able to watch the series.,worldofwandcow,cj2v37t,2,t5_317be
