Youre welcome to post this there! ,veterinarians,cfbz8lj,1,t5_2s1pg
1253107,0,t1_ciahvr8,No worries about any questions man these are totally normal concerns when first entering the field. Your first couple of euthanizations WILL be hard but most vets will understand if you need to remove yourself to calm the animal or get rid of stress on the animal. DO NOT DO THIS! Watch the first few and cry silently if you dismiss yourself the first few times when you HAVE to be involved it will be a mess for everyone involved. Also keep in mind that you were probably a lot closer to your grandmothers cat than you would be to a patient so while still very hard it is easier to disconnect. The final thing to remember when having to put down an animal is that you are doing a final service for a loyal friend. I wouldnt want any of my human friends to suffer in that way so I certainly wouldnt do the same to an animal. Further questions just ask away!,veterinarians,cial8q0,3,t5_2s1pg

8226806,0,t3_4rt2sn,Yep youre required to have a certain amount of animal experience and work under a veterinarian before you apply to vet school. But above all I encourage you to get a feel for what its like to work in the veterinary field because there are some darker aspects to it that you might not expect.Any college where you can complete your prereqs will do but it would help tremendously if you apply to a school that offers animal experience even if its out of your state!,veterinarians,d55wnw5,1,t5_2s1pg
8328943,0,t3_4tn0aw,I gather you are in the US.......if thats the case you will need A LOT of animal and veterinary experience.  In the range of several hundreds of hours.  Your GPA isnt great but may be good enough for some schools though the average admitted GPAs are around .,veterinarians,d5io8oc,3,t5_2s1pg

10964754,0,t3_5wkbk7,First of all you can never diagnose anything based on a picture.  Second of all no matter what it is the answer is always to have a veterinarian examine the pet in person.  Plus the puppy should be seen by a vet regularly at this age anyways to complete vaccinations and to monitor health and development.  Thirdly please read the rules before posting here.,veterinarians,deaxqw1,6,t5_2s1pg

11749774,0,t3_67jfvc,I personally know a vet who removed all of a rabbits teeth and that rabbit had a great quality of life with wet mashed up food as its diet. As long as you can find a vet who is willing to do that I think you have a good shot at keeping your rabbit alive and well for a bit longer. ,veterinarians,dgrv73p,1,t5_2s1pg
