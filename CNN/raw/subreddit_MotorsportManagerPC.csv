9299802,0,t1_d8uksn5,Devs told us that after the videos they improved AI difficulty but I think it will still be easy for us who are better strategists than RL team principals.,MotorsportManagerPC,d8uteo6,1,t5_3gw13
9554282,0,t1_d9q1qek,The comments on that vid have no handle on reality. It looks really good for low settings.    Im sort of baffled that there isnt a top down D view however.,MotorsportManagerPC,d9qrgdr,1,t5_3gw13
9575414,0,t1_d9sphkk,I dont think AlexZAfRo understands this game very well. I find it hilarious how they all got it going at highest speed and keep mentioning how they have so much going on and failing to capitalize in certain situations. Slow it down and you wont be overwhelmed and will actually be able to do proper strategy calls and not miss a message saying you broke front wing or something like that just as youre about to pit to replace rear wings. ,MotorsportManagerPC,d9td5va,1,t5_3gw13
9594178,0,t1_d9vim8d,Woah woah woah so all the money Ive spent on buying new parts for my cars is wasted come next season? Or what do you mean by development? Still fairly new! ,MotorsportManagerPC,d9vog31,4,t5_3gw13
9594668,0,t1_d9u1sra,Yeah I think the minimum requirements are very conservative. I run the game pretty well just some occasional stuttering on a Sony Vaio Pro . Ghz i HD GB RAM. Granted thats at the absolute lowest graphics settings possible and Im too scared to experiment with raising them!,MotorsportManagerPC,d9vqm6f,1,t5_3gw13
9594841,0,t1_d9voh3f,So Ive been putting the maximum amount aside for development each week and have a couple of races to go until the end of the season where Ill probably be promoted. The car is good for the division so I stopped developing parts saving the money for next year. Should I instead be improving my parts now as it will feed into to the base values for next years car or from what youve seen would I be better waiting til the new season?  ,MotorsportManagerPC,d9vrdr5,1,t5_3gw13
9603659,0,t3_5c5ft7,My reserve driver is taking acting classes to expand his resume which is probably good because Im not resigning him at the end of this year! Great thread hope to see more!,MotorsportManagerPC,d9wuip4,5,t5_3gw13

9640218,0,t3_5d1r9g,Great points you have summed up here! Just one thing im not sure aboutgtStill on development At the later stages of the season consider doing the best part possible in each category ignoring all the risk parts. Itll help next seasonWhat about building a high risk part and not using it in a car? If its your best it should be carried over into your new car and by not using it in a race it cant be banned.I tried that one time but arent sure anymore if it actually got taken over from the previous season. ,MotorsportManagerPC,da1cssq,3,t5_3gw13
9644083,0,t1_da1rhag,Yeah definitely Ive been in the ERS with no rule changes so its been reverse grid order. I can imagine opening a gap straight off the bat if youre using a quali grid order would be the best tactic,MotorsportManagerPC,da1tz4e,1,t5_3gw13
9644193,0,t3_5d5208,You wont have as much money to develop the next seasons caras well as HQ stuff and so on.howeverI might help you get more points in that season via improving the current carresulting in more prize money.I like the high investment routebut its a trade offkinda depends on your placement in tier  Good placement  probably low because of prize. money or Low placement  go for high investment,MotorsportManagerPC,da1ugps,2,t5_3gw13
9649684,0,t3_5d5fw2,Would love this. I do wish there was a bit more indepth stat and history tracking so that you could see results from past seasons driver and team records and so on. Even if the records were just from the start of your game.Any Football Manager players will know exactly what I mean. You could be  years into an FM save and you could go back to  years earlier and see every result from leagues youve had loaded. Im a little surprised MM doesnt have the same depth to its history considering the big Sega and Sports Interactive influence and its part of why I love FM tracking history as much as it does is amazing.,MotorsportManagerPC,da2iupc,3,t5_3gw13
9653500,0,t1_da2zixv,Damn thanks. I was worried the money in ERS might be similar to the points system. Very small variations. Time to scaleback my offseason plans a bit ,MotorsportManagerPC,da2zt9i,1,t5_3gw13

9663482,0,t1_da45xmh,Thank you for the answer. Is every season start the same? As in do parts always start the season at very low condition and the first couple of races are filled with part maintenance pit stops?When advancing a tier Ill always have a shitty car even if I buy the best parts and set the most money aside possible and even if I have a very good designer for the level?,MotorsportManagerPC,da485ro,1,t5_3gw13
9681297,0,t3_5dpee8,Awesome read. I wish I had the ability to get this far in the game but my demanding work schedule combined with the fact that I chose the Long races means that Im only on race  in my first season with Octane.

9694560,0,t1_da80oxf,Ive tried to get Sharp so many times but shes always not interested. Have Steinmann lost a lot of races due to rulebreaking parts in your save too? Chapman was demoted from I think  or  races this season which he had won. Now because the drivers had really low morale due to this theyve lost both HAM and ROS for season . Theyve got the best car but the worst drivers now according to the game.,MotorsportManagerPC,da826jn,3,t5_3gw13
9695093,0,t1_da5yfmu,dont give exact values give us a range.  If you have only the exact value and it isnt perfect you have no idea if you have to go left or right. If you have a range then you start from one extreme and move to the other making the setup much faster.  Also tire pressure depends on the weather if its cold you want less pressure to heat up the tires or you will have to push them the whole race.,MotorsportManagerPC,da84js1,-2,t5_3gw13
9708086,0,t1_da8hz6r,Yeah unfortunately given that GP usually has a  system unless youre unlucky going with two star drivers is usually a bad idea even if Jonsdottir is normally a good partner for Valdes. Youre better off either getting a cheap good option like Rodrigues or somehow hit Valdess maximum potential quickly enough and then giving the  spot to a very cheap pay driver like Lahtinen and not doing anything with the reserve seat.ZRT honestly sounds a bit tougher than Predator right now  Rodrigues may be good but Valdes has a nice peak as well so theres a good reason to keep him and focus on restructuring the team as well. You managed to get into GP sooner than I did at least nd season vs rd so theres some hope.For now yeah focus on hitting sponsor bonuses maybe lower the budget for next years car for a few races and do your best to stabilize.gtMain problem is bad qualifying cant get temps rightQualifying is much harder than the race yeah. Normally Id have a really hard time matching the top tier cars on Saturday and then dominate on Sunday because they somehow cant match their qualifying pace. Try to get the maximum quali bonus and focus entirely on that for the time being. A good strategy can offset a slight lack of pace and maybe give you more options in the race.Its no different in F either. Hulkenberg has improved massively for me this season and is regularly attacking the top  now often outqualifying Rodrigues by over a second yet in the race Im almost dead even with him.gtand horrible driving in the first few lapsThats just overtaking being awful all across the board right now. Lahtinen always found herself in that position for me whenever she somehow qualified in the top .,MotorsportManagerPC,da9qahk,2,t5_3gw13

9830923,0,t3_5fzyvs,Wait so what you saying is that each car uses the same set up for every race. That sucks I want to set up my car for each race I just wish practice was longer. What I dont get is that every race your driver starts with  experience in setting up the car.,MotorsportManagerPC,daozogm,1,t5_3gw13
9850966,0,t3_5gc77y, words Rodrigues and Lahtinen.If theyre not options focus on expanding your HQ and stabilizing to the best of your ability. You want to make sure that once you transition to GP your staff salaries including drivers arent very high as GP is a financial black hole compared to GP or F. Get a cheap good driver and a pay driver to partner them and give everything to the  driver. Develop parts as much as you can.If you see a spec part vote invest everything into it. Its huge for Predator and will give you a good car in GP as well once you win the championship. GP had  spec parts in S for me which was enough to not only give Rodrigues a dominant championship win but also give him a good enough car to dominate GP the very next year as well.Laras good as the other guy said but youre not going to be able to get her until GP or F as she starts with  stars and you need a level  scouting facility for her. She was worse than Rodrigues for me though.,MotorsportManagerPC,darlqn2,2,t5_3gw13

9857417,0,t3_5gi6ce,I like the idea. I would also like to be able to cancel contracts if I decide to.  Would be cool to still get contracts offers for spots you already have and you can cancel your existing ones if you want to change.

10695751,0,t3_5s1lk0,Overtaking even on overtake and attack mode is really fucking hard in this game. Therefore a tactic I have found to be good is to stay behind the person in front of you while conserving tyres and fuel more than him. He will eventually pit and then youll go full hammer time and overtake him in strategy easily.,MotorsportManagerPC,ddj6qwe,1,t5_3gw13

11384926,0,t1_dfmfmsy,Agreed. That is the case IRL obviously but usually in the game as well from what I know. One exception that I have witnessed is if rain is due to appear about  laps or so after the start. Then shortening your pitstop by s can be more relevant than the s  laps of  tenths with . tenths per lap of fuel you would have been able to go quicker on track. After all there are too many factors to say one strategy is the best for all cases but usually keeping your fuel low should be quicker overall.,MotorsportManagerPC,dfmgn7r,1,t5_3gw13
