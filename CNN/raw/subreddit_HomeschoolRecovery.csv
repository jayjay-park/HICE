I love my friends but very few understand what it really means to be homeschooled no matter how hard a time they had in public school is it different from the complete isolationextremism we experienced.Thanks for sharing your story  look forward to getting to know you more!,HomeschoolRecovery,d4u409n,1,t5_3cxr2
