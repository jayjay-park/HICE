We are instinctively wired to recognize aggressive behavior as it could likely be a sign of a threat.  Proving empirically what we already know is a little bit more difficult.,JungianTypology,d7rafxd,3,t5_3fvc4

9630050,0,t1_d9zgjh4,One thing to keep in mind is that supervision kind of works the opposite way benefit does. The Supervisor activates the Supervisee while the Beneficiary activates the Benefactor.The information and energy loops are the same for every type because we all have all  IMs just the order differs. Ill use Ti and  Ti for Spin and Ti and Ti for Charge.Here are the  information loops for INTP the same as for everybody just the order differs                     gt Tigt Negt Figt Segt       |    |     |      |gt Tegt Nigt Fegt Sigt                      gt Tegt Sigt Fegt Nigt      |     |      |     |gt Tigt Segt Figt Negt                       First two rows are the external layer in Model B last two internal. First two functions in each Ring are strong functions High Information last two are weak functions. Inside a loop all functions have the same Charge and tame StaticDynamic. Judging functions supervise perceiving functions and vice versa. The vertical connections symbolize information sharing. First two functions in each Ring are strong functions High Information last two are weak functions this is because of the information sharing along vertical connections. Information is shared with functions of the same Judging Perceiving same spin but opposite ExtraversionIntroversion and Charge. You could also rotate any of the loops two notches and you would also have valid connections for example connecting Ti to Fe but in this case you would be representing agenda compatibility instead of information content.Now for the energy loops benefit rings                     gt Tigt Nigt Figt Sigt       |    |     |      |gt Fegt Negt Tegt Segt                       gt Fegt Segt Tegt Negt      |     |      |     |gt Tigt Sigt Figt Nigt                      First two functions in each ringare High energy functions last two are low energy. Inside a loop all functions have the same Spin and same ExtraversionIntroversion. Judging functions activate perceiving functions and vice versa. The vertical connections symbolize energy sharing. Information is shared with functions of the same Judging Perceiving same Charge but opposite StaticDynamic and Spin.The first model is pure information the second pure energy. If we want to combine the two well have to not represent some connections for example the symmetrical ones. Lets try this with just the external layer of Model B to keep things simplegt Tigt Negt Figt Segt       |    |     |     |       v    v     v     vgt Nigt Fegt Sigt TegtThe horizontal connection still represent information but now the vertical ones show energy transfer benefit relations. We achieved this by simply shifting the Vital ring one function left. As you can note this diagram shows the full information rings but just half of each energy ring.  Ni activates  Fi and Si activates Ti completing the loop. We can represent these Vital to Mental activation by rotating one of the rings by  spaces.gt Tigt Negt Figt Segt                           |     |     |     |gt Sigt Tegt Nigt FegtNow we have the second half of the energy loop represented. The Mental gt Vital diagram shows the Individual in a productive state expending energy to pursue a goal while the Vital gt Mental diagram shows the individual in a restful receptive state consuming resources and accumulating energy. Of course both state are stages of the same cycle. If we want to show the full benefit rings we have to break the information cycle instead. Again well only represent the External layer of Model B.gt Tigt Nigt Figt Sigt       |    |     |     |       v    v     v     vgt Negt Fegt Segt TegtYou may recognize the above diagram as Model G representing the full Energy cycle but only one half of the information cycle. The other half can be shown asgt Tigt Nigt Figt Sigt                           |     |     |     |gt Segt Tegt Negt FegtThe Model G diagram Externalities supervising Internalities shows the progressive individual contributing to society while the next diagram shows the regressive stage in which the social output is deemed dangerous or unsuitable so its blocked destroyed.As for suppression functions of the same JudgingPerceiving Same Introversion Extraversion and same spin suppress each other they occupy the same mental space so the presence of one excludes the other. For example Ti suppresses Fi. You can see that contrary functions suppression pairs can never be in contact as they are part of the same supervision and benefit rings but are always separated by a perceiving function. This is the same idea as Leonore Thompsons brain lateralization model but with function signs considered as well. in essence what ading function signs does is move add dynamics to a static model. While the  function model looks at a frozen picture of the psyche at a certain pint in time by adding signs were tracing the process through all its stages much like the Enneagram does as well.,JungianTypology,da03o06,2,t5_3fvc4
9778211,0,t1_dahh3nt,Thanks for posting this.  Ive never seen this source before.  I agree that this makes understanding these concepts more accessible as it can be hard to know where to get started with Socionics concepts.  One thing though  I think it might be a little confusing to call the Role Function the Opposing Function as Beebe calls the Ignoring Function the Opposing Function or Opposing Personality which I think is consistent between the two systems.  I see where the author is going with the idea that the Role opposes the Dominant but I think that Beebe explains that aspect better with the DemonicDaemonic.  ,JungianTypology,daidorg,3,t5_3fvc4
10143255,0,t1_dbplpgu,If you are looking for information about the animus Id suggest as I often do reading Von Franz and also Emma Jung wrote about the subject although I have not read her work. I was going to chime in about the samesex couple thing but peppermint and DoctorMolotov hashed it out well in that thread.  I would add that I just happened to be watching a Von Franz interview and she said something to support their views.  When two people of the same gender live together they tend to constellate the shadow.  When two people of opposite genders live together they tend to constellate the animaanimus and that is where the bigger work lies.  Beebe also mentions who Ive read is homosexual but havent seen him say so himself that identifying with the Opposing Personality is part of it.  He describes the bitchy male as identifying with the Opposing Personality.  He doesnt seem to make distinctions in sexual preference when it comes to how dreams manifest.  He often talks about his anima as an elderly Chinese launderer who is drained and ignored by her gambling husband.  There is never anything sexual about his description.  I think the two things are separate.  They may be substituted with the OP but the animaanimus is probably bigger than you and your perceptions of sexuality or gender.  The animaanimus is where your soul lies.  It doesnt care who you think you are or what you identify as. It is not your true self or your inner being.  It is an archetype and you can never touch or see or know an archetype.  You can only seek it and gleen information about it but you can never catch your anima or animus.  I think that this is a bit of a problem. You should not try to identify with the anima as if it could be incorporated into the ego.  It is independent.,JungianTypology,dbto51e,2,t5_3fvc4
