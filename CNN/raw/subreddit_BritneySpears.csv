8766087,0,t3_505cxn,I have some strong feelings about last nights performance. The set was awesome. Especially after realizing there were people making those shadows. Britney looked amazing. I have a problem with Britney sharing a performance. This isnt  anymore and I felt like it was basically Britney being a set piece for GEazy. Which I didnt like because shes too fucking iconic for that. She didnt sing! Like how is she gonna lip sync her midtempo?! Make Me isnt even a hard song. Her swerving GEazy was the best tho tbh and it feels like hes glomming on to her and I dont like that. Im just kinda conflicted because I feel like she deserved and also could have brought better. ,BritneySpears,d71f96r,3,t5_2qopv
