177575,0,t1_ceyn2ij,Commonality can be divided into two areas structuralairframe bones and skin vs everything else mission systems engine etc. Since you are cool with RAND Ill use them to provide a point of reference. Applying the above split to the F would mean a cost breakdown of  airframe and  everything else. I know the F is a different plane with two engine. For the moment lets assume that any decrease in the Fs engines split of overall unit cost is consumed by its broader scoped avionics package cost.Airframe commonality failed to meet the goal of high identical parts. However that doesnt mean the  version doesnt still closely relate. Consider for example the fuselage and wing panelling. The  version differ in those panelling mould lines owing to differences driven by basing needs I.e. STOL intake and wing sizes but theyre still clad in the same stealth material. Benefits in airframe commonality can be achieved in ways beyond identical parts.The rest of the aircraft totalling together for the greatest share of the cost actually have a very high degree of commonality. The mission systems are over  with one of the bigger noncommonality being cause by the presenceabsence of the gun. Finally The FA is comprised of  individual parts while the FB is made up of . The FC consists of  individual parts. Despite their differences the three variants are actually  percent common.Could be better but given the difficulties up to this point  isnt too bad especially given how little the Viper Harrier and Hornet have in common.,CredibleDefense,ceyns4c,2,t5_2y5ib

632468,0,t1_cgc51oq,Im not sure I see the connection between the annexation of a peninsula in the Black Sea with a global breakdown of free trade. Certainly if the entire world were to degenerate into a world war where the sovereignty of all major nations was under constant threat we would see the breakdown of the liberal world order. But thats not whats happening. All thats happened is one little annexation between one regional power and its weaker neighbor. There will be friction between Russia and Ukraine and to a lesser extent between Russia and the West but the world economy wont grind to a halt or at least it shouldnt. Its really up to the west how much of a big deal this is. Hopefully there isnt a trade war but even if there is one its not like the whole world will come tumbling down. If you think the absolute sanctity of national sovereignty is necessary for the world to exist as it does today then you are mistaken. States violate each others sovereignty all the time. A states sovereignty only exists insofar as that state can enforce it and thats basically how our liberal world order has been working all along. The overall peace of the international system can endure small wars i.e. gross violations of sovereignty as it has done multiple times over the past  years. Iraq got invaded in  and  Lebanon in  Georgia in ...and the world hasnt fallen apart. I really dont see how this is any different. The main difference is that no blood has been spilt so far in Crimea. Well get over it the world will move on. The annexation of Crimea is primarily a symbolic shift in the status quo Crimea is a tiny region of only a few million people and governing it will not make Russia any more powerful than it was prior to Euromaidan. Even if Russia invades eastern Ukraine it honestly wouldnt be a huge deal to the rest of the world. Ukraine will either succeed or fail in preserving its territorial integrity and thats all there is to it. No need to extrapolate any further than that. Russia wont be in any kind of position to perpetrate a broader campaign unless the West pushes too hard against him and creates a situation where he has no choice but to act drastically. ,CredibleDefense,cgc5usz,3,t5_2y5ib

With more strenuous training and more direct involvement in their structure and leadership. Then a well trained and well equipped fighting unit would be working for the interests of the WestGulf States in Syria. What we have now is sophisticated weapons being released in limited amounts and the FSA is losing men in droves to the more extreme factions.

863873,0,t3_23zqzi,Its a good discussion but I think the key thing to take away is that logistics is not antithetical to tactics nor to strategy  Id personally see it as a key enabler at all levels.  A better  if less punchy  quote might instead be Amateurs only study tactics professionals also study logistics.In UK doctrine and I assume others but I cant speak from experience the three main levels considered are Tactical small unit manoeuvre up to approx Company level Operational up to Battalionplus and Strategic.  Theres also an argument for considering a Grand Strategic picture at the level of national interest which also brings in a wider range diplomatic and economic pressures and actors to be deployed.In all of these logistics can be a consideration   For a Sgt at platoon level the soldiers sailors airmen marines in the unit need to be fed rested and appropriately armed and equipped in order to be a viable fighting force.  Within the limited geographical and temporal boundaries of the Tactical layer this mostly means sharing out what you already have on hand. For a Captain or Major planning a Company or Battalion op theres a much bigger G issue including fuel approach routes phase lines and staging points and allocation of support such as ISTAR and fires.  This is the level at which the original quote most often applies  not least because it is expected that all officers as they rise through the ranks should have at least an appreciation of tactics whereas logistics is the factor which will distinguish them. At strategic level logistics and infrastructure overlap significantly but without strategic lines of communication ideally both air and sea a force either cannot be deployed in the first place or will end up stranded.  This incidentally has significantly shaped British foreign policy in the Indian subcontinent over the past decade  because the border crossing into southern Afghanistan at Spin Buldak is so critical to the supply of Helmand province it has effected a strategic shift of priority from India toward Pakistan.That said I completely agree with ucompletewildcard that winning wars is about understanding the context as well as the intent and priorities of the opponent in simplistic terms the victory conditions.,CredibleDefense,ch2h7kt,5,t5_2y5ib

935024,0,t3_24tq38,gt To determine how much the nuclear balance has changed since the Cold War we ran a computer model of a hypothetical U.S. attack on Russias nuclear arsenal using the standard unclassified formulas that defense analysts have used for decades. We assigned U.S. nuclear warheads to Russian targets on the basis of two criteria the most accurate weapons were aimed at the hardest targets and the fastestarriving weapons at the Russian forces that can react most quickly. Because Russia is essentially blind to a submarine attack from the Pacific and would have great difficulty detecting the approach of lowflying stealthy nucleararmed cruise missiles we targeted each Russian weapon system with at least one submarinebased warhead or cruise missile. An attack organized in this manner would give Russian leaders virtually no warning.gtgt This simple plan is presumably less effective than Washingtons actual strategy which the U.S. government has spent decades perfecting. The real U.S. war plan may call for first targeting Russias command and control sabotaging Russias radar stations or taking other preemptive measures  all of which would make the actual U.S. force far more lethal than our model assumes.gtgt According to our model such a simplified surprise attack would have a good chance of destroying every Russian bomber base submarine and ICBM. See Footnote  This finding is not based on bestcase assumptions or an unrealistic scenario in which U.S. missiles perform perfectly and the warheads hit their targets without fail. Rather we used standard assumptions to estimate the likely inaccuracy and unreliability of U.S. weapons systems. Moreover our model indicates that all of Russias strategic nuclear arsenal would still be destroyed even if U.S. weapons were  percent less accurate than we assumed or if U.S. weapons were only  percent reliable or if Russian ICBM silos were  percent harder more reinforced and hence more resistant to attack than we expected. Of course the unclassified estimates we used may understate the capabilities of U.S. forces making an attack even more likely to succeed.gtgt To be clear this does not mean that a first strike by the United States would be guaranteed to work in reality such an attack would entail many uncertainties. Nor of course does it mean that such a first strike is likely. But what our analysis suggests is profound Russias leaders can no longer count on a survivable nuclear deterrent. And unless they reverse course rapidly Russias vulnerability will only increase over time.gtgt Chinas nuclear arsenal is even more vulnerable to a U.S. attack. A U.S. first strike could succeed whether it was launched as a surprise or in the midst of a crisis during a Chinese alert. China has a limited strategic nuclear arsenal. The Peoples Liberation Army currently possesses no modern SSBNs or longrange bombers. Its naval arm used to have two ballistic missile submarines but one sank and the other which had such poor capabilities that it never left Chinese waters is no longer operational. Chinas mediumrange bomber force is similarly unimpressive the bombers are obsolete and vulnerable to attack. According to unclassified U.S. government assessments Chinas entire intercontinental nuclear arsenal consists of  stationary singlewarhead ICBMs. These are not ready to launch on warning their warheads are kept in storage and the missiles themselves are unfueled. Chinas ICBMs use liquid fuel which corrodes the missiles after  hours. Fueling them is estimated to take two hours. The lack of an advanced early warning system adds to the vulnerability of the ICBMs. It appears that China would have no warning at all of a U.S. submarinelaunched missile attack or a strike using hundreds of stealthy nucleararmed cruise missiles....gt Washingtons pursuit of nuclear primacy helps explain its missiledefense strategy for example. Critics of missile defense argue that a national missile shield such as the prototype the United States has deployed in Alaska and California would be easily overwhelmed by a cloud of warheads and decoys launched by Russia or China. They are right even a multilayered system with land air sea and spacebased elements is highly unlikely to protect the United States from a major nuclear attack. But they are wrong to conclude that such a missiledefense system is therefore worthless  as are the supporters of missile defense who argue that for similar reasons such a system could be of concern only to rogue states and terrorists and not to other major nuclear powers.gtgt What both of these camps overlook is that the sort of missile defenses that the United States might plausibly deploy would be valuable primarily in an offensive context not a defensive one  as an adjunct to a U.S. firststrike capability not as a standalone shield. If the United States launched a nuclear attack against Russia or China the targeted country would be left with a tiny surviving arsenal  if any at all. At that point even a relatively modest or inefficient missiledefense system might well be enough to protect against any retaliatory strikes because the devastated enemy would have so few warheads and decoys left.,CredibleDefense,chakfk4,1,t5_2y5ib

Its even not about the training every soldier of the Iraqi military could have individually been trained to a high personal standard and even that wouldnt make the military strong. I think that this is exactly right. And I would add that the solution is to have rigorous unit training. Force the men to sweat and blister as a unified group where they can slowly build a deep psychological bond and trust with the men beside them. This takes time and does not fit well into a numbers driven metric model. It is expensive as it requires months to a year of work by experienced trainers. There will be a large amount of pressure to send the trained unit into combat before it is ready as the security situations always seem to be tenuous in these places. The western model of training by gentle persuasion will not work in an Arab or Afghan army as their culture is different. There is also the difficult task of vetting the individuals and forcing a diverse make up of each unit so that the fight for the nation and not a particular religious or ethnic group. There are a number of difficult challenges in this idea. But we have seen time and time again how poorly performing our current model is. We fail to instill a sense of patriotism or even unit cohesion in the men we try to stand up as an army.

1349544,0,t1_cilfqg6,How do they have significant utility and against what sophisticated enemy? A conflict with China will be focused on putting airfields out of action and sinking ships actions better accomplished with cruise missiles and Durandal bombs than mines. Against the Russians mines would be more of a hazard to NATO forces advancing against Russian tanks who are going to be hammered by air power. Mines could be somewhat useful I suppose but NATO has such massive conventional superiority that it seems excessive. Against other nations like Iran or Syria again the focus is going to be on achieving air superiority and then mopping up ground forces. Maybe you can air deploy some to limit mobility but simply having air superiority is going to limit mobility more than a few rapid deployment mine fields ever could. To be honest I dont really see the point in banning mines either at least from a practical standpoint. It seems like a bunch of politically correct crap. But at the same time there is basically zero utility remaining to them in any conflict outside of the Korean Peninsula. Getting rid of something were not likely to use anyways is a good way to build some soft power. And as far as banning aerial bombs and artillery go thats different because that would be completely eliminating  a capability that we are actually likely to use in the near future.

An easy counter to terminal phase decoys is to use a millimeter wave radar and IR imager simultaneously it would make decoys uneconomical might as well just add more warheads.

Quick bursts with HEfrag rounds could get you a greater number of effective strikes against infantry and softskin vehicles than FFAR pods or guided missiles. I dont actually know if this method would get you more effective strikes its very much out of my range of specific knowledge. Bullets are also cheaper than PGMs although Id guess that a single mm rocket costs about the same as a burst of mm high explosive rounds. Out of curiosity what are the cult of the gunisms? I havent been around here long enough to know which arguments are fallacious and which arent.EDIT As I think about this issue and my ideas about it Im starting to think that Im unintentionally wandering down the wrong road. Instead of thinking about a system that makes the A and its gun better keeping it as a jackofalltrades with unproven survivability in a truly symmetric fight the realities of potential future conflicts seem to call for two different systems. The first would be a proper bomb and missile platform with speed altitude engagement range and avionics to function and survive in contested airspace. This would fill the original intended role of the A though without its risk envelope and low survival estimates. It should be capable of CAS against large or small deployments of enemies on a roughly equal footing with the US Russia China Iran et al. The second platform would wed the As durability to a weapons load more suited to asymmetric warfare. Ideally it would be lowcost armored enough to resist many but not all AAA threats fixedwing for the same reasons the A was fixedwing and capable of carrying a very large load of rockets and some guided munitions. If guns are actually useful for engaging infantry and softskinned vehicles then it would carry said guns to maintain cost efficiency in asymmetric engagements.,CredibleDefense,cj4z0yh,2,t5_2y5ib

The problem is with the lack of Fs Im going to have to use Fs in the air superiority role in the early phases as well which is another reason why I need all . Im going to have some Fs doing air superiority some doing those early phases of persistent attack opening the holes and again the F is not compelling unless its there in numbers the general says. Because it cant turn and run away its got to have support from other Fs. So Im going to need eight Fs to go after a target that I might only need two Raptors to go after. But the Fs can be equally or more effective against that site than the Raptor can because of the synergistic effects of the platform.andgtBut in the first moments of a conflict Im not sending Growlers or Fs or FEs anywhere close to that environment so now Im going to have to put my fifth gen in there and thats where that radar crosssection and the exchange of the kill chain is so critical. Youre not going to get a Growler close up to help in the first hours and days of the conflict so Im going to be relying on that stealth to open the door Hostage says.Also interestinglygtThe F is geared to go out and take down the surface targets says Hostage leaning forward.

They would like nothing more than for Western states to ramp up their military and intelligence efforts against their groups at home or abroad. That was after all the primary achievement of the  attacks  to drag us into over a decade of whackamole against such groups.I understand what Leahy is getting at when he says year war  there is no chance of permanently eliminating the threat from Islamist terrorists. The Middle East North Africa Pakistan and Afghanistan are the main breeding grounds for terrorism and these places seem to become less stable by the day. One thing is clear to me though direct Western military action and the American presence in the Gulf has in many cases only emboldened our enemies efforts against us. It has given them recruits and crucially weakened states like Libya Iraq and perhaps Syria so that there is no shortage of armaments for these groups. I dont know how we would eliminate the causes of radical terrorism poverty is not going away in the region. Water is becoming increasingly scarce and that definitely played a role in sparking the Syrian Civil War and IS is currently using the dams in Iraq to their advantage. States in these regions continue to be corrupt and ineffectual at providing good governance in terms of services and education.I think our best bet is to work with states no matter how brutal repressive or antiAmerican they might be. A rational state is always better than a terrorist group. We should not be afraid to work with the Syrians Iranians and Hezbollah behind the scenes. We should not be afraid to degrade our relationships with the Gulf nations if they do not go after the private donors to radical fundamentalist groups and Wahhabist sects and if we can manage the fallout in terms of oil prices. We should not be afraid of advocating for more Kurdish autonomy or a Kurdish state if they prove themselves in the fight against IS.

Turkey occupies a strategic location between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea effectively bottling the Russian fleet up. In exchange NATO protects Turkeys territorial integrity. Now we in the US may not think that Kurdistan is much of a threat but I bet the Turks feel differently. And if we support the Kurds then suddenly the whole NATO calculus begins to shift for them. The US and NATO seems unwillingunable to protect and even seems to be working against its interests. Meanwhile NATO expects Turkey to be the shield in the event of hostilities against Russia made all the more real by events in Ukraine just across the Black Sea. The Turks have historically maintained their hard nosed stance towards Russia because of the protection offered by a western power. In return Turkey serves as the gatekeeper of the European Ocean. If Turkey is forced to question its relationship with the west it would surely also question its ability to defy Russia independently. Either they would be forced to soften towards Russia or seek other global or regional powers to help stiffen their resistance. Iran for example has a powerful regionally military a shared border with Turkey and Russia and its own Kurd problem.

3090842,0,t1_coicguu,Precedent. The US and Russia have decades of history of supporting weaker opponents against one another to draw from. Russias involvement in supplying for example the NVA is very different from its involvement in supplying North Korea. Conversely Americas involvement in supplying say the Hungarians is very different from their involvement in supplying the Afghans. The level of involvement determines the overarching geopolitical tensions. More involvement more serious equipmentlethal weaponry supplied the greater the tension between the two powers.Risk. There is low risk of negative unintended ramifications from supplying the Ukrainians with advanced communications great as long as its not the cutting edge that the US military itself uses where as there is a much greater risk if the US supplied lethal weaponry. A sizable portion no matter what effort is put in will make it to the black market. If the black market becomes awash in lastgen communications gear which would be an upgrade for the Ukrainians thats not a threat to the US. If instead it was say the latest bloc of patriot missile and their radar systems just a hypothetical their may be more appropriate examples the risk to civilians and military flights would be tremendous. This isnt just about keeping it away from NGOs that might use it against the US but also keeping it out of Russian hands as well. Responsibility. The more lethal and sophisticated the equipment sent to the Ukraine is the great the stake the US has in the outcome. Not only because of the cost of the investment but also the effectiveness of the equipment provided. If the US were to dump a large amount of military hardware into the Ukraine and the Ukraine were to lose its civil war anyway this would a cause a tremendous deficit of trust in Americas ability to support its allies and uphold its treaty obligations.  ,CredibleDefense,coid4i8,8,t5_2y5ib

4492814,0,t1_cswseva,gt But a F got shot down using an obsolete but slightly modified lowfrequency radar. Sure one swallow doesnt make a summer but has there been anything categorically demonstrating that modern stealth is stealthy against lowfreq?The SA does not use to my knowledge a low frequency radar.  There are many reasons why and Ill get into them in a moment.Edit The Ss fire control radar is in the GHz range frequencies where LO aircraft become visible start in the low UHF to high VHF range which is around MHz so its extraordinarily unlikely that they were able to lower their frequency to the point where it would have made a difference.Rather the F nearly  years old at that point the oldest and most primitive of all dedicated stealth aircraft in question flew the same route several days in a row and the route was known to the air defense commander.  All stealth aircraft see a sudden signature increase when they open their bay doors and the shot was taken at the time that the doors were open.  When the doors were open there would be no need to use low frequency.gt Lets assume that the F is stealthy against lowfreq radars right now. When someone figures out how to tweak their radars to detect stealth...what happens to the F? Im pretty sure its a lot harder to remanufacture an aircraft to make it stealthier than it is to change a radar set or radar software.This is a perfect example of what Im talking about...radar is just a difficult topic to understand.  If anything the balance is stacked in the other direction its easier to screw up a radars ability to detect something than it is to make a radar magically pull a signal out of background noise.No aircraft with a vertical tail is undetectable by VHF radar.  There are several different types of EM interaction with solid bodies and they govern various ratios between wavelength and feature size.  When wavelengths are very small compared to features the laws of optical reflection govern for wavelengths which interact with specific materials rather than those that pass right through.  As they get larger edge diffraction begins to change the way radar reflects.  As feature size matches with wavelength a form of scattering known as Mie or resonant scattering dominates.  As wavelength increases beyond feature size Rayleigh scattering takes over this is what makes the sky blue and then beyond that EM energy no longer interacts with objects.VHF waves are roughly sized to the tails of fighter aircraft and so Mie scattering is an inevitability.  Any VHF radar properly constructed will return radiation off of any modern fighter aircraft stealth or not because of this resonance between feature size and wavelength.However theres a big problem with low frequency radar which makes it pretty much impossible to use one to shoot down an aircraft.  The directionality of a radar beam sent out from a beamforming antenna is inversely proportional to the wavelength.  This is a fundamental property of how EM radiation works and there is no way around it.  Because VHF is a very very large wavelength in the m range it requires a very very large antenna to produce a narrow beam.  Because antennas have the same properties when receiving that they do transmitting it also means that it requires a very very large antenna to directionally receive.  For example the half power beam width for a linear phased array electronically steerable radar with elements every half wavelength is roughly N where N is the number of elements.  So for a  resolution the highest possible frequency VHF radar m wavelength must have  elements meaning it has to be  meters wide.  That angular resolution corresponds with a beamwith m at km meaning that if a plane is km away right on top of it from the m wide radar the radar can only resolve it to within a m wide gap.  If the radar is also m tall it will resolve the plane into a m area assuming it has perfect range resolution.  If the radar is less than m tall the resolution will be much worse.  Obviously thats nowhere near good enough to hit a plane with a missile and thats with an array half the size of a football field and the plane right on top of you.But even as you make the array larger youre still limited by what sort of antenna you can fit in the missile.  This is why fire control radars use mm wavelengths because you can fit the antennas into a usable package.So the problem with thinking youre going to tweak radars to detect stealth is that you dont get anything for free.  You can detect aircraft with longwave radars but you cant tell where they are because you have to construct a buildingsized antenna to determine their position with usable accuracy.  You can use a bistatic radar to ignore all stealth shaping and radar absorbing effects you essentially see the radar silhouette but the plane has to fly between the emitter and the detector and you only know that its somewhere in there not where it is.  You can use multistatic radar to determine position where a bistatic radar cant but the plane has to fly in the intersection of at least three emitters but then its obvious where your detector is and its easily jammed and easy to simply blow up one of the emitters.This isnt something as simple as upgrading an antenna changing wavelengths or updating software.  This is fighting with the laws of physics as you try to extract an ever decreasing signal from an ever increasing noise background.  There are real limits and real problems with trying to implement any particular solution.  ,CredibleDefense,cswz8zc,18,t5_2y5ib

Pantsirs primary way of searching for targets is using a UHF PESA radar sure it has an IR camera but that is used primarily for engagement rather than search Along with the X and Ku band radar.

The lowball unit cost figures Ive seen all assume that the F will reach its full production run of  planes.I suggest taking a look at this for everything you need to know about the F including the cost comparisons under section . The F is anywhere from s the cost of an F to less than half depending on the figure you use. gtThe problem is that there is no way the USAF can afford to keep all of those planes in a flightready state.I disagree. The F has a cost per flight hour of about  while the F has a cost of about  with the FC at about same source. Thus with a fleet size of  Fs replacing  Fs  FCs and  FEs it comes out to about . million for the Fs and . million for the aircraft it is replacing for each aircraft in the fleet to fly one flight hour. That doesnt even account for the increased maintenance cost of the E variant over the C I used same cost for both to simplify the math the cost saved by completely eliminating both the FC and the A and the entire support chain for those aircraft and the cost saved by reducing the training flight hours through use  of simulators. I suggest instead of looking solely at the cost of the F that the media feeds to you you look at the cost of maintaining the current fleet as well and do a comparative analysis to form your own understanding. gtdefense cuts are one of the few things both Republicans and Democrats agree upon think again.That isnt what Ive been hearing from the Republicans and they control the House. Particularly the presidential candidates. Even Mitt wanted to increase the budget and he was far more moderate than whoever is going to come out of the primary this year. And Hillary who has a  chance of winning the nomination is more friendly to the defense establishment than Obama is. Besides the really dangerous period for the F passed in . Costs are already down to about  million a pop you would have to really cut down on numbers to keep it as expensive as the T and it is already cheaper than the F ever was. gtHow are you getting to  planes? Youre nearly  planes short.Sorry youre correct it is closer to  than . The original  partner nations are buying  and yes the Canadians are eventually going to buy it if they have any sense it is literally the same price as a Super Hornet with SLEP today and will be cheaper than the SH in a matter of years.. But that doesnt count export orders. Singapore is looking to buy up to  the Israelis are looking to buy  the Japanese and Koreans may buy up to  each with current orders around . And then there are the Poles Romanians Saudis etc who are all likely to buy it at some point given that it is the second cheapest western aircraft in production right now and the only th gen aircraft around world wide.

For what its worth I find youre a pretty reasonable fellow with a level head and calm arguments which is refreshing online.I did like a few things in this piece like how Quiggin uses the closures of the Suez Canal as a tidy natural experiment to approximate the cost of a losing a sea lane. And of course the piece is written cogently.Accepting for a moment his analysis of the benefit of open shipping lanes I do not think his cost estimate matches what hes trying to measure exactly what the costs are to protect commercial sea routes. In an example he estimates that the benefit . of GDP amounts to only onetenth the cost . of GDP ie the entire naval budget of a typical nation. However the naval budget funds far more than just keeping shipping lanes open so the actual marginal cost is far far lower.I use my car for work travel and leisure not only shopping.Overlooked are the primary reasons for maintaining a bluewater navy.That was my main concern.A few other things caught my eye like the very high estimate for the Collins Replacements . billion per boat which is high even compared to other Australian government estimates but were not germane to Quiggins central idea. His opinions in his last paragraph however are far less wellsupported reflecting common misconceptions about militariessuch as implying that militaries are blind to economics and that defense contractors are funded largely to grow the economy. He asserts that war is almost invariably an economic disaster for all concerned which is tempting to believe but ignores a number of conflicts including the SixDay War which the author even mentions the other ArabIsraeli wars the Falklands War several USled interventions and most prominently the Persian Gulf War.So I didnt feel this article merited approval.

That however would be made impossible with the current Pentagon culture  of which the JSF is largely symptomatic  of using politicallymotivated goals as excuses to excess spending. Every single program is managed that way. Concurrency also would be impossible within such parameters because you cannot have clearly defined goals while handling immature technology. You cant have onschedule onbudget oncapability with immature technologies. From the practical position you cant guarantee such results and you are forced to pick two. Either schedule and budget or schedule and capability or budget and capability.  Every project manager with experience will confirm that the rare cases where this unwritten rule doesnt apply are largely unique exceptions.

Followup artillery andor bombing strike was routine in WWII  when resources allowed it.Speaking of Afghanistan  all sides did this. Soviet artillery usually hit the same spot in  min and attack helicopters would often strife same place after a delay only constraining factors being fuelammourgent tasks. It was based on the knowledge of core cultural principle Koran mandates that body of deceased should be buried before sundown of the same day. So with high probability dead and wounded will be evacuated by associates in a matter of hour or two. As for another side  snipers of armed opposition in Afghanistan were often shooting to wound a stray afghan or soviet soldier. Then they would shoot to kill anyone coming to evacuate wounded and killed. Boobytrapping bodies was also very frequent.Similar tactic was mentioned in american memoirs about NVA tactics. ,CredibleDefense,d71yk49,4,t5_2y5ib

Not very long but gives a neat explanation of the different strategic priorities countries around the world decide.

If you charge a horse into a block of spearmen you end up with a dead horse. If you are riding your horse and get showered by archers you end up with a dead horse. However cavalry was used by pretty much everyone who had access to suitable horses for centuries because when used in conjunction with other types of soldiers it was very deadly.Lone tanks are easy targets. This is what doomed a lot of Syrian tankers during the Civil War  for whatever reason infantry and armour coordination seems to have been entirely lacking in Syrian training.

Its acquisition costs are higher than an F as well particularly after undergoing a Harvest Hawk conversion or similar to allow it to conduct strikes.The payload and time on station would undoubtedly be nice but it suffers a big impediment when it comes to vulnerability. A C is big it doesnt climb very fast and it cant quickly exit the area or go on the offensive if it comes under threat. A number of Cs have been lost to simple MANPADs including an AC with presumably modern countermeasures in Kuwait. This is especially painful with their larger crews and lack of ejection seats.Fighters can conduct CAS in dicey situations because they have the option of dropping their external loads and lighting up the afterburner to escape if things go south or moving to engage the hostile SAM site or aircraft.,CredibleDefense,dcitdei,6,t5_2y5ib

10826818,0,t3_5ukg48,No one is innocent or guilty in all of this from a nation state perspective they just have interests. US UK and Russia signed a treaty with Ukraine stating if you give up your nukes we will respect your boarders and defend you. The Russian didnt respect the boarder to keep a warm water port and obama folded like a lawn chair. Bush Senior promised Gorbachev that NATO wouldnt expand B.J.Clinton asked do you have it in writing?  No it was a promise among leaders to promote good faith. B.J. then blew it off and expanded NATO ignoring the trust we earned with Russia.Stalin starved the Ukrainians to gain control of the region and the Ukrainians will hate them for generations so the Soviets move a bunch of Russians in to Ukrainian territory who are now voting to join Russia big suprise there. A big fail all the way around. We can get past this if we want to. Keep in mind the Russians were our allies in every major war the United States has fought. Its kind of a love hate relationship. We need to stop pointing fingers and forge new relationships in the world. I would support Russia and Israel over Europe and China right now. Who cares how they run their society its theirs. We should spend more time worrying about the health of our society and less time pointing fingers at others. We held back the Soviets by building a stronger relationship with China. We can hold back China with a stronger relationship with Russia. We will build new bonds in the future like securityforeign relations are not a state of being but a process requiring constant attention and vigilance. I dont understand the deal with NATO they have been riding on the American dime for years. Their armies are weak under supplied  and their leaders are insolent. Perhaps before we support NATO they should see the value of their relationship with the United States. Without us the middle east Russia possibly even China would send them to the dust bin of history. Maybe they should step up and show their benevolent protector some respect before we bail them out again. Back to the budget... the military is a good investment. It creates innovation jobs and security. A powerful military is like fire useful if under control. Social programs are breaking the back of the economy and creates weak minded slovenly decadent slaves. The majority of our tax dollars provide bread and circuses to the indolent.

Is the US theoretically capable of developing a missile shield that can counter the Russian strategic ballistic missile arsenal? Sure. Russia can also theoretically or even notsotheoretically place massive garrisons on NATO borders and highly sophisticated aerospace defenses that de facto pose an offensive threat to Eastern Europe.  If Russia is worried about the US creating dangerous nuclear instability perhaps a wider policy would have been to not covertly work to elect someone who is literally too stupid wrathful and narcissistic to appreciate the dangers of disrupting nuke equilibrium to the American presidency.,CredibleDefense,de4a2pf,3,t5_2y5ib
10902037,0,t1_de4baw8,We do have some precedent for this sort of arrangement its never worked great but it has been made to add merchant shipping to supplement end strength in not wholly conventional ways. The easiest is the RNs mad scramble to convert RFA and merchant ships to low rent amphibs and assault ships for the Falklands. Which of course involved the loss of the Atlantic Conveyor which hosted even some Harriers before her loss. But a more relevant example I think is if we look at the IJN in the late s. The navy knew they could not build carriers quickly and needed more than they had even if in a secondary role. So when they had the chance the IJN subsidized the cost of the Hiyo class ocean liners on the provision that they be built with features which would make them useful for conversion should the need arise. and the hulls were eventually bought by the navy outright in early  for completion as carriers. While useful in a pinch or as transports their relatively low top speed and cramped spaces made it difficult to operate larger and heavier strike aircraft. ,CredibleDefense,de4gufg,2,t5_2y5ib

Theyre now going over to vertical hot launches.The point I made about the size of quad pack missiles is that you set the size of the launcher based on the largest missile that youll put in it.
