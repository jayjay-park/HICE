3907082,0,t1_cr1kdmr,gt Maven  Gradle vs. Nugetgt NugetThey are not even remotely the same.   Maven amp Gradle are extendable and have countless plugins  Its not simply a dependency fetcher.gtAkka vs. Akka.Net  OrleansAkka.net is nowhere near where it needs to be and virtual actors in Java are in Orbit.   Orleans is good quality though.gt Eclipse vs. Visual StudioVisual Studio is nice but when its useful its not free Its a bunch of Microsoft ball sucking lockin its not nearly as extensible as Eclipse isgt FindbugsThe website does suck but I dont like them because of their website    There are a lot of open source quality checkers that actually detect bugs as opposed to syntaxcoding standard compliancegt Guava It has a lot of convenience features that have nothing to do with Type erasure.   It has great collections inln features.  I dont particularly like type erasure but it has enabled things like JRuby to surfacegtTrove CollectionsIts around performance benefits and in some scenarios Java runs circles around .NET even without these optimizations.   Even without true tail recursion and structs for nowgtequalsverifiergtIrrelevant in C because   you dont override Equals as often becauseIn an OO system there usually is some reference type so you still have to care.gt  when you do these warnings are builtinto the compiler.I dont see it complaining for GetHashCode  ! and Equals consistency what are you referring to?gtCamel vs. WCFThe level of sophistication is significantly different.  Camel has far more functionality and integrations.gt Retrofit vs. Retrofit.NetJavas version was created  years ago with a last update date of  days ago.   .NET version was created  years ago copying the Java version and hasnt been updated in two years.   Thanks for the example.gtA subset of features hardly maintained or closed source.   Youre still not getting this....gtGraphXIt is available for Java. Click on the Java Tab for examples   The key point is that its not available for .NETgtBoot vs. Not even close gtCheckerYoure closedmindedness about types is really holding you down.   Take a quick peek Open your eyes.gtErrorProneYoure delusional again Argument via Tu QuoQue.   And immature at it too.gtPMD vs. ReSharperCommercial tool and not the same thing.  Your style of simply making broad insulting generalization in response to specific criticism is the thing thats problematic.  Also your slanderous use of terms for people with mental handicaps reinforces that you must be an angry sheltered teenager with a close relative that works for Microsoft.gtlicenseverifier vs. NuGetNuGet doesnt check for licences and break the build when youre out of compliancegtsame as above regarding machine learningSo youre referring to things being substandard unmaintained or commercial.   Yeah that sums up why the JVM platform is a better choice for now.gtonly  or  of them are actually relevant. The rest is absolute crap.
