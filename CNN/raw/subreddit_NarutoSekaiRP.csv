His parents had told him a little bit about the other Clans that were starting to congregate in and around Konoha as it grew and he remembered something about a Clan that loved to keep pet dogs around for some reason... was it for food?  Nah why give them collars?  He wracked his brain trying to remember but he was still at a loss when he came within talking range of the kid so it left him with little option but to ask.Do you usually talk to your dog or are you bored?

Eyeing the one who brought the main idea up Shinzo shrugs his shoulders.So essentially a small group becomes the target while the rest wait around for an ambush? Sounds good in theory but in actuality it may backfire. If they see us training they may not want to test their skills. Bullies generally pick on those weaker than them. He says to the group. Turning to the inuzuka he nods.Establishing we are older will only mean that they wont mess with us it doesnt really protect any younger ninja in training. Is there a group leader to these bullies. Finding him we can cut of the head of this group.Looking around Shinzo closes his eyes.Bullies are such a drag. He says with a sigh.,NarutoSekaiRP,cwxs7yc,1,t5_3ai37

She certainly had more energy about herself than he did.Digging in to the patch hed pull out the carrots quite quickly and dump them in the bucket with a metallic ding. The mission really was one of the most boring things hed had to do in a while but of course the money hed receive for it made things a little better. Maybe hed actually be able to pay the old lady at the tea shop back for all the free meals she had given him in his time living on the streets. Regardless it was all one step closer to becoming a chunin.Once he had filled the bucket he began replanting quickly afterward before hed move on to the corn.

This WAS what he wanted after all right?Distant memories of his mother flashed through his mind. He exhaled deeply.My shurikenjutsu is passable at best.  It was one of the only ones I could really grasp.

He started to walk down the hill then a kunai whizzed passed him.  He had a savage idea and turned to Itame.Itame we should try and scare him.A little joy leaked into Aomines face and voice.

Kaze being here might present a problem hes the one whod give me a hard time if he notices There was a joke to be made here but Kotomaru pretended to be mature enough to ignore it.  Kaze had proven friendly enough but Kotomaru couldnt help but remember his reputation for jokes.  In any case having to work together on a mission would force him to deal with whatever this was. He noticed Shi who seemed rather well equipped for a mission of this type. We wont be moving quickly so having some extra supplies will be helpful rather than harmful  He also noticed he brought along a weapon with nice reach.  Should be handy for fending off bandits making grabs at these supplies without chasing anyone he thought.  Impressive!  Recentering himself he turned to Dr. Yamanaka.

It seemed like a whole lot of effort to expend for a seemingly simple task but there are different kinds of effort after all.Noticing the boy starting to take a break he inched closer although he didnt call out to the guy.

Fortunately Benko was about to rely on both.He used a zigzag movement all the way up to the top of the tower using the cracks in the wall as turning points where he could plant his feet. The rotation and continuous redirections made him a hard target. Additionally the shield in his left hand was swiping up and down behind him to pick off the ones that got close. The paper shuriken were no match for the strong iron of his handy shield.The cloud of paper looming ever closer was obviously being controlled by the man hed been fighting. As the asshole appeared again Benko knew he had to take him out in order for this onslaught to stop. To do that he had to stop the guy from making so many paper clones and dodging everything. And to do that... well Benko was sorta out of ideas. All he could really think of doing was to wail on him until he found a way.Benkos sword reached forward toward the man as his shield continued to block the projectiles.

10997558,0,t1_dee03tj,YoshinoThe moment there was news of unusual activity in and around the leaf the Intel division was on high alert. Everyone scattered around the department teams being sent out here and there for reconnaissance.Yoshino herself was being sent with a team of scientists to a Cumolonimbus apparently so she could take over a flying animal and get a closer look at it without risking to send an actual person up.So she rushed to the site as quickly as possible eager to see what adventure was in store for her this time.,NarutoSekaiRP,deejfl6,1,t5_3ai37
11040900,0,t1_dej5nv6,Kotomaru had deftly managed to avoid the majority of party goers down on the hall.  After the events of a week ago he had no interest in drinking and he had eaten a little earlier when he had tested out room service.  He was sure hed be in the mood for hors doeuvres later.He had even asked for some dress advice while he spoke with the room service staff and was dressed far more sharply than perhaps ever before.  He wore a white suit and matching pants a black collared shirt and silver tie with black shoes.  Getting dressed had seemed more complicated than putting on mission gear he had to retie his tie  or  times to get it right.He leaned up against the railing of the balcony looking out at the end of the sunset before it truly became night time.  He hoped he could stay out of the eye of the rest of the guests for his entire stay.uMercurialSlam ,NarutoSekaiRP,dejgt0z,1,t5_3ai37
11048445,0,t1_dejebgq,FyaAs Fya approached with Kotomaru he somehow found his eyes fixated on the mans muscular build. Glancing down at his own stomach temporarily he poked his own stomach a few times which seemed very lackluster in comparison. He wasnt jealous.. maybe a little depressed.. but not jealous.Fya made sure to pay close attention to the demonstration almost like it were a mission briefing. He was glad to know that there wouldnt be anything looking to kill him however.gt Last few things try to take it slow if you gulp down air your trip might end a little early. There should be enough air for  hours worth if you do it right. Just be sure not to bump the tanks on stuff dont want the valve busting or shutting off. Oh before I forget be careful of the floor bed. If you see sand its fine. If you see orangebrown clay instead itd probably be better not to touch it. Alright youre all set you guys have fun!Dont breathe much dont party with the tank too hard and dont poke the mysterious clay  got it.ag he acknowledged with a smile before letting out a small chuckle. Seriously though understood loud and clear. Thanks sir.ag he bowed his head politely.Ready Kotomaru?ag,NarutoSekaiRP,dekbm1x,1,t5_3ai37
11120777,0,t1_desa6z3,FyaHe couldnt help but laugh at poor Kotomaru who seemed to be a target for physical abuse from the manta ray. As long as it wasnt stinging him or biting him it was all in good fun though. Hed been so wrapped up in playing with the manta ray that he hadnt even noticed Kotomarus alarming reaction until the very last second. By the time he did the sharks were already upon them.Panic set in momentarily causing him to freeze before he eventually realized that they were safe. For a moment there his heart had actually skipped a beat. He couldnt actually tell the difference between a threatening shark and a nonthreatening one but the sharks seemed placid enough  and they were kind of cute.So kawaii..ag he thought to himself.Narrowing his eyes some he focused on the cave from which they emerged.,NarutoSekaiRP,desj4rl,1,t5_3ai37
11212382,0,t1_df2r8sn,Ren laughs. Well at least nearly all of the fifth floor that is She points out with a grin not sure that seeing all the water related places of the resort counts as seeing half of what it has to offer. Yeah I agree. Its very nice and soft and comfortable but I feel out of place in there. Like I might break something or ruin a chair or get a stain somewhere. And then like ruin a chair or bed or sheet or something worth  ryo or something you know? Ren jokes but reallly its hard to be at ease completely in a place so opulent. And Ren adds a bit more quietly We still dont know why we were all invited here. Oh the clothes I have the same problem but Ive found some that I really like. With a bit of a blush she admits I want to take them up on the offer to take them home with me or at least some but the trip here involved a storm and theyd get ruined and in Konoha what would I do with clothes like that? She speaks a little softly and a little rushed as if embarrassed to admit the allure of the fancy clothes. ,NarutoSekaiRP,df2wsk6,1,t5_3ai37
11283458,0,t1_dfa11im,KuroiThe Uchihas eyes widen in surprise. Oh youre a leaf nin as well? Well I didnt expect to meet many others here so far from home He returns the serve. Between the movements he wonders why the game would be played with such a light weight ball. Seemed as if even the breeze would send this little thing flying. Funny game indeed.Im Kuroi! He chimes in barely slapping the ball back. He had trouble with the amount of power it took to not send this thing flying at another guest. You may have seen me about a year ago as I only just returned to the village after a long personal journey. Much has happened since apparently. He says idly keeping his eyes on the ball.,NarutoSekaiRP,dfayoo5,1,t5_3ai37

11621766,0,t1_dgcz5rc,Plotgt Hullo were here to see a patient. Daisuke Liupold.Oh? Hm lets see lets see..ag repeated the woman behind the counter to herself. Eventually she paused and a solemn expression fell across her face.Im sorry maam but.. Mr. Liupold is deceased. There are no visitors to the mortuary right now.agThe woman beside Ren Ariel just looked to be getting infuriated. As understandable as it was causing a scene here could spell trouble for them  and right now this woman looked like a bomb about to go off.umescalrider,NarutoSekaiRP,dgdc6l7,1,t5_3ai37
11737840,0,t1_dgq04gl,Ren waits a little impatiently for the flashy showmanship to run its course so they can get to the meat of this competition and climb death mountain X. Wait trivia? With a sigh she listens to the question which honestly sounds like a bunch of gibberish. Just who the hell is Felonious Mink and why would she have heard of some lowlife scum who plans dates badly like that? Maybe its all supposed to be a joke?Joke in mind Ren tries to come up with a quip answering Guess I really... screwed the pooch!ucptjharkness,NarutoSekaiRP,dgqiilk,1,t5_3ai37
