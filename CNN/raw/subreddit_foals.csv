5425743,0,t3_3p81d5,Theyve got some valid points  the rant about Snake Oil is pretty on point.  Its important to take in to context that these guys have at best a cursory knowledge and exposure to the band  so theres not much depth here in the analysis other than a surface reaction.  That being said though some of the more pointed comments I found to be totally fair. ,foals,cw5713k,1,t5_2wua8
5753243,0,t3_3pcukf,Im contemplating on making the trip to Chicago for Foals from KC but them not being the headliner makes me a bit nervous.  Im afraid they wont play a full set and be rather short.  Am I wrong thoughts anyone?,foals,cxa8tob,2,t5_2wua8
7283342,0,t3_47l2q0,Dude man.. I dont know who you are but thats exactly how I feel about Night Swimmers. Just seems like the type of song they could build up and build up while Yannis does something crazy like jump off a balcony or eat a scorpion.. a lot like After Glow or Two Steps Twice. ,foals,d262fzv,2,t5_2wua8
7522068,0,t3_4hdhha,I feel like TLF is greater than the sum of its parts but Holy Fire or What Went Down have some of my favourite songs on them.,foals,d2x80e7,1,t5_2wua8

9319339,0,t3_580e7v,Im unaware of any reason other than personal choice. I know specifically the band said they would never play This Orient live again but I dont think they ruled out the others.  Even when I saw them in  touring Holy Fire in Philadelphia Spanish Sahara was the only song from TLF that they played. Blue Blood Total Life Forever and Miami will still sometimes find their ways onto a setlist I saw TLF in  which was awesome but the other three albums get much more attention. I would love for them to start adding more songs from TLF though.  ,foals,d8xalpv,2,t5_2wua8
10396675,0,t3_5mylgc,Haha its funny because people have SUCH different opinions. I guess that proves how dynamic this band is. Personally I can identify with each and every song and I can hardly pick top  favorites.,foals,dcmj2js,2,t5_2wua8
10600132,0,t3_5rl66u,This track has one hell of an atmosphere to it. Theres so many arpegiated guitar loops playing in the instrumental and the wash in reverb makes the song sound immense. Lyrically it might be Yannis strongest song too considering its subject matter.  ,foals,dd9bm5u,1,t5_2wua8
