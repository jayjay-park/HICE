2459579,0,t1_cmfkquw,We heartily welcome our Porelician neighbors. What is the basis for your claim over Mordy? When Theodor I united Ralosz several centuries ago the Mordians chose to affiliate with Ralosz but remained independent until relatively recently. We are willing to negotiate to reach a settlement but at the moment we see no reason to cede any part of Mordy.,sevareign,cmfpf3a,1,t5_352hw
