7765654,0,t3_4ll7e2,Huh. Ive never tested FA in the site. DM me your forum username and Ill turn off FA on your account.Also TODO for me test FA on the forum! Okay! Tested FA on the site with my test account iareseetest and it works great. If you were able to enable FA it means you had at least one working code generated by your FA app on your phone. Without at least one working code the forum software wont let you turn on FA.Anyhow you can DM here on reddit or on the forum iaresee and Ill turn it off for your account I run the forum if youre truly stuck. Ill need you to supply some verifying info before I do it but we can discuss that over DM.,AxeFx,d3ow6p8,2,t5_2soy9

11150488,0,t3_5z4hij,I had a similar question when I got the FCB and didnt have much luck getting any help from here. The best tutorial I found on programming the FCB was this video It may be in Spanish but even without understanding what he was saying it was pretty easy to follow along for me. If you cant get it working after watching the video let me know and Ill try to lend a hand.,AxeFx,devw9d3,1,t5_2soy9
11152588,0,t1_devw4pg,No you send any PC or CC message from the  Im using it without the UNO chip to change both presets and switch scenes and I could use it to do switch more via CC if I wanted to.The problem is that the LED lights dont track the way you want them to. For example Ive got my upper row of five foot switches to select presets via PC messages and the lower row of five foot switches to select scenes via CC messages. So lets say I select preset  which is selected using footswitch  on the top row. The footswitch I selected lights up. Now I want to select scene  for the same preset. I just have to tap footswitch  on the bottom row. Now the LED light next to footswitch  turns off and the LED light next to footswitch  turns on only. What would be nice is if the LED for the preset footswitches would stay lit until another preset was selected while the scene footswitches were selected. The UNO firmware accomplishes that sort of logic.,AxeFx,dew4u01,3,t5_2soy9
