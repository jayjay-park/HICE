I am an introvert and I can get all my socialization needs through spending time with her. She is almost the exact opposite and loves to be out in large groups of friends doing whatever. This has never been an issue but this past semester has taken it to the extreme. Her job through grad school requires a very hardcore and flexible schedule often working until am on projects.

People get upset when I suggest that because they seem to think children should never be told that one parent starved the other of sex and intimacy. My response is Why wouldnt you arm your children with the knowledge about and proper response to a relationship challenge they may encounter themselves?You dont make it a bitter or humiliating beatdown of the refusing ex when talking to the kid. You present it as a regrettable reality of incompatibility which developed over time and could not be resolved.  Such things happen frequently in marriages and often lead to break ups.

I can vouch for that because when we lived in an apartment and our upstairs neighbors had sex he always wanted it too. Ive been with and known many porn addicts. He doesnt show the signs. He rarely uses his computer when Im not in the same room as him and he only uses his phone when we are out and about and having to wait around for something because he hates cell phones. We dont have intimacy often but he does like to spend time with me whenever I move to the bedroom at night he chooses to come with me.

200551,0,t1_cez6hne,I think the op let his frustration come through and it made his point unclear. I see the situation being more like this.  The guy tries to initiate but is repeatedly turned down.  After a couple times he makes an association whenever the so puts on her comfy clothes she does not respond to his advances. Thus he is soon conditioned to see the comfy clothes and automatically decide any initiation will be shot down. How long does it take the So to realize that if she puts on comfy clothes the advances wont come? It sucks to be turned down and I know it must suck to deal with a grumpy husband you just turned down. How much easier is it to just put on clothes that signal I dont want sex tonight and stop any advances before they begin?

301336,0,t3_1xiy3c,It sounds like you guys have some pretty seriously incompatible preferences and his solution for the incompatibility is to keep doing what he wants to do and get steadily sulkier that it doesnt work for you the specific woman who is currently his partner and to overtly and tacitly blame you for not responding the way he wishes you would which is more about his ego than your actual pleasure. No WONDER you arent getting aroused.The diurnal cycle fuckery can be dealt with provided youre both actually willing to meet halfway which is a pretty big assumption with this level of selfishness. But his insistence on giving you stimulation that doesnt result in pleasure is just... infuriating and demented. I also dont really come from oral Id be willing to practise but it mostly gets me wet because Im a grinder not a twiddler. Most of my successful positions are facedown with high pressure on the mons  the root of the clitoris  and very very little direct approach on the clit.Separately the lack of sensation entirely makes me wonder if you might have a hormonal birth control issue. When my clit is as numb as my elbow its been because I was on the pill. That was always a dampener on my libido and my actual sexual response so I suggest it in case thats familiar to you. Its also possible that too much highpowered vibration direct on your clit has desensitized you somewhat so taking a break and trying to get to byhandbasics might give you some insight.All that aside though if this guy cant stop pouting and guilttripping you for not coming in exactly the way he wants you to come Id find it hard to continue fucking him at all even if you do figure out a good way to come in coitus.,DeadBedrooms,cfbzzm8,2,t5_2t25p

Then approach him from a position of strength secure in yourself and sure of what you want.

Happiness comes from within you its not something that can be granted from someone on the outside  moreover its not fair to ask that from someone.

And Ive had them reply because I want to use that.  Well youve been real busy with the administration of this project while Ive been emerged in the design and details of can you tell my why this is still preferred?  Well I dont know that much about what youre showing me so why dont you stick with this and try to make it work. That was an actual exchange I had onceThen it comes back that the preferred method wont work and time no longer a luxury as it is now under construction then the same supervisor will come over and direct me to fix the situation solution to which is my original suggestion or a variation thereof but have NO recollection that I already foresaw this.  Nor do I get their gratitude or recognition for fixing their mistake.

431129,0,t1_cfpeu2l,I blame feminism for teaching society that men shouldnt be men...that the manly man is a vile womyn oppressor seeking only to further oppress women with our phalluses.I blame myself for swallowing the blue pill.I seek selfimprovement.  I seek selffulfillment.  I seek being a strong male role model in my sons and my daughters lives.  I believe that while my wife and I are equal partners in our marriage that men and women are not truly equal...that there are things women are better at biologically speaking and there are things that men are better at biologically speaking and wed be fucking smarter as a society in recognizing these strengths and weaknesses instead of pretending that were all equal in every way.I believe TRP isnt about being an alpha asshole...its about finding the balance between alpha and beta qualities that make me the ideal man for my wife or for a relationship.Yes some of TRP theory is just about fucking random women.  Yes there is a bunch of anger and resentment out there from some TRP men that weve been effectively lied to for a generation.  Yes there are TRPers that have entirely rejected the concept of relationships with women.But the TRP is about selfimprovement more than anything else.  Or at least thats what I take from TRP.  I have empowered myself by swallowing The Red Pill.And at the risk of oversimplifying and being overly general  the idea of men taking back their lives and empowering themselves instead of giving everything away to women scares the living shit out of feminism which is why TRP is so beaten on my most in the reddit community.,DeadBedrooms,cfpg9f1,-1,t5_2t25p

435055,0,t3_1z1y71,Coming at this from the perspective of a girl around your age there are only a couple reasons I would stop having sex with my SO. If I wasnt being emotionally fulfilled in another aspect of the relationship then I probably wouldnt have sex as much. You didnt mention it in your post but I have a feeling there are other issues in the relationship as well. Is this the case?The other reason I wouldnt want to have sex as often is if it hurt but Im assuming thats not the case here.At least for me I can see how this could have started as something small where she feels like something is wrong in the relationship but she doesnt tell you straight up obviously a communication problem. Instead she lets it fester and then stops wanting to have sex with you which obviously makes you want sex and want to talk about it and solve the problem I dont blame you sex is pretty darn important. Then she complains that all you want to talk about is sex when she really wants to talk about something else going wrong in the relationship. However if you dont know what the problem is its not like you can bring it up.I think if you have been dating this long and live together its worth the effort to try and fix the relationship not minimizing your current efforts since it sounds like you are trying very hard!. Honestly unless she just has a really low libido I think theres got to be something else going on that has to be addressed. However thats just my yo girl opinion on it!,DeadBedrooms,cfpuwv3,5,t5_2t25p

Ive only lost a little bit of fat compared to when I probably was about half as active but on the other hand my blood pressure is normal and my cholesterol is very very good.  I generally feel healthy and can do all the things I want to do with my body.  Getting this regular exercise has helped with my sleep and mood.So when I suggest you become more active its because its GOOD for you not because I think reaching some ideal body weighttype will magically stoke his libido.  Most of the HL women with LL guys here are in very good shape much better than me I imagine but I dont have a dead bedroom because its not about you its about your partner  of the time.Your guy has to want to change and even if he wanted it he may just be for whatever reason basically asexual now.  It could be low testosterone psychological issues depression etc.  But if hes embarrassed and sexnegative is he going to be willing to do the hard work that MIGHT get him more interested in sex?I know it hurts to hear but you are far better off cutting your losses.,DeadBedrooms,cgo0odp,2,t5_2t25p

916100,0,t3_24gwxf,I think she is trying too. But theres more than one factor here.It sounds from what you said that she was trying to get herself in the mood for sex and I believe she wants sex. But her option is you. So shes there trying to get in the mood. She knew full well you had  minutes before you had to leave plenty time to suck you off. But in the time it had taken you to prep she wanted out. Too much pressure maybe? Her telling you to leave for work was her escape route.Just as her getting something to eat with her friend was a stalling tactic  if that even happened... why would she text you when she arrived at a restaurant? I have never texted anyone that Ive arrived somewhere unless Im specifically meeting them. To me that sounds like a text sent waiting somewhere. Maybe sat in a car trying to piece her mind together.The fact that she turns out naked when its late and taking  minutes to not shower says yes she is trying but shes just not feeling it. The fact shes not wet is also a bit of a testament as well.Time for you two to have a talk about this. She will lie to begin with and say everything is on her. But I find a couple of bottles of wine loosen up the tongue quite a bit. Even tell her right at the start we are not having sex tonight! It may surprise her she may not believe you but tell her again straight faced we are not!. This isnt a time to be all soft spoken and assuring you need to tell her straight. How can she be honest with you if shes afraid that youre just making a move on her?So the wine is flowing. If after a good dosing she still isnt being straight with you threaten. No I dont mean with weapons. I mean tell her that you cant do this relationship anymore. Your lack of intimacy is just met with excuses and although you can see shes been trying ensure you tell her you recognize this theres something wrong. Unless shes straight with you about her feelings how she feels you have no option but to put an end to the relationship entirely. Let there be tears assure that you dont hate her you just cant abide a situation like this any longer and if she wants any future with you she has to start talking candidly. Men dont understand subtext men dont understand sugar coating men dont understand saying one thing but meaning another. You need her to say what she feels no matter what the truth is.You need to force the talk you need to let her rationalize badly and only then are you in any danger of getting her to be honest.That said you need to be prepared for the honesty. Sorry my friend. The reason shes not sexually into you outside some medical condition is everything to do with you. Without knowing more I cant tell you how. Other than ask Hows the career? Money flowing in OK?  Hows your belly? Not too fat? Any majorly wobbly bits that need urgent attention? Been cramming too many burgers and fries?  Hows your other interests? You keeping a keen hobby alive and well that involves you being out of the house?I feel the above three things are why women fall out of attraction for their men. Its universal in truth and also universally denied which to me is amazing. But Ive yet to find a real life situation thats opposite to this that isnt some crappy Hollywood movie.The fact is shes not into you sexually. You need to find out if this is the case or not. Wine does wonders in getting the free speech flowing. But be prepared for honesty.After shes honest you can then decide where you need to improve. If she refuses honesty and says its all on her then the ultimate decision is only one of leaving. Source  years relationship  years dead bedroom.

One of my recent theories in deadbedroomology is that a rare form of mold causes a human to lose hisher desire for sex. Usually the mold only affects one of the two romantic partners of a relationship which is why it is so vexing. If only it werent so discriminating! Your description of her she doesnt even bother with kisses anymore and sometimes even backs away is particularly enlightening as this mold contamination has been know to cause along with sexual aversion an anomalous backward gait in some severe cases. If you could do this for the deadbedroom community Im sure they would be grateful and so would I as I intend to profit from proving my theory. Remove a portion of plasterboard from the wall of your bedroom. Nothing bigger than  feet by  feet but not that much less either..

Oh we definitely dont understand the LL perspective. Not even close. We just assume that they should desire us sexually and that theres something wrong if they dont. We task them with improving our sex life but then dont tell them how or help them to figure it out. Then we take it badly ifwhen they fail. It effectively turns sex into a chore which makes them even more LL than they already were.The one thing that would concern me about getting the LL perspective is getting bad advice.

I remember in one a female poster probably LL replied saying she needed to be seduced throughout the day  make her feel special do nice things for her build up to it. Scented candles and rosepetal baths basically. We all know from experience that this doesnt work. But her post was highly upvoted in that thread.I think one of the biggest obstacles is that virtually no one  HLs or LLs alike really understand whats going on.,DeadBedrooms,chq9gdd,5,t5_2t25p

My wife pulled the ole times up guess Ill give him a lay and later told me she was worried that I was going to leave her if the timer expired on the sex clock.So ya never give him dread sex.

1131876,0,t1_chww146,gton two separate occasions Ive gone longer than a year without sex and I didnt notice anything different in my behavior. Sure I was lonely and wanted a bf in this time but I didnt ever feel the need to go out and get laid. I think theres a big difference in a persons sex drive when they are alone versus in a relationship or at least how they cope with their needs. When I had no partner yeah...I had the desire for sex and companionship and intimacy. I wasnt the kind of person to go out and just hook up so there really was nothing I could do about it so its a lot easier to deal with. My longest stretch without sex after I first started having sex was about  years.gtIve also never rejected my partner so we do have sex but I never initiate anymore either. Never rejecting? Id write you in for a sainthood compared to my wife. On the other hand never initiating...thats bound to cause some serious questioning on the other partners part eventually. Its like saying I dont mind you fucking me when you feel the need but I dont really need it or you. Im really not as into you as you are to me. I dont love you the same way that you love me. At least thats what it says to ME.gtOdd question but masturbating doesnt really do it? Masturbating is a fleeting pleasure. Its like the difference between getting a small taste of your most favorite food in the world one small bite versus having a comforting and satisfying meal where that one favorite food is but one dish out of many excellent dishes.Also if youve never had a dick you have no idea how wonderful being IN someone can be just as having never had a vagina Ive not known what its like to be on the receiving end. Maybe PIV sex isnt that great to girls but for guys...woooo!Also at this point masturbating is the only outlet I have for my frustrations and desires. Im starving by way of small tastes of meals that Im being denied. gtTo me this means that needing sex isnt about the releaseorgasm but the emotional closeness. For me its both. The release is great and it is a bonding experience provided both people feel the same way. Its about releasing that energy into someone youre in love with or at least passionate about. Also cant dismiss plain old animal instincts and attraction. Sometimes just the passion doesnt have to be love and energy by itself can be a great experience.Everyones different. Some need it others dont. At least you know where you stand so you can be honest with yourself and any partner youre with.Holy freaking christ...these have to be the most poetic descriptions of sex thats ever come out of my head before and its morbidly tragic that I feel like Ill never feel this way with anyone ever again.What a waste...,DeadBedrooms,chwy219,2,t5_2t25p

1188181,0,t3_27o6kp,I started reading here long before I ever posted close to a year. Ironically my SO was who sent me a link here. I got quite the wakeup call as well it cut me deep to hear the anger resentment and frustration. Mostly because I knew my SO shared many of the sentiments posted here. I took it entirely personal I felt vilified. The longer I read here the more I learn to take the benefits I can. I need HL perspective that isnt my SO. I need to hear someone else state something in a different way that my SO has tried to tell me a million times. It is cathartic to give my perspective because I this has been a struggle for me as well.  Read participate allow other to read your perspective and challenge yourself to understand theirs. People have been nothing but receptive to me here but I know thats because Ive put in effort and a lot of work to fix my failing marriage. Had I posted when I was in my rut of wanting to ignore our incompatibility Im sure it would have been a different story. But I would have never posted at that time because for me distancing myself from our issue was the route I took. I also could never have articulated what I was going through so I applaud you for being here and expressing your perspective which can be very difficult for many LL to do. I agree that no one can expect you to want to want to have sex.  I know that feeling of understanding the concept of wanting to want it but it just not being there for me. I told my SO a hundred times that I wanted to want it I just didnt.  Over the last year Ive discovered for me at least that it is possible to develop your own unique want for it. I may never want it in the same ways as my SO or certainly as much but I find a enough overlap in our positive connections to give him engaged and meaningful sexual experiences.  He finds fulfillment in that I have a positive connection and need for it even if its a lesser amount than his ideal scenario. I was completely indifferent to sex and physical intimacy I did not identify myself as a sexual person. At one point I thought that I would honestly be ok with never having sex again.  Nothing about connecting with sex comes particularly natural for me. But I have managed to find some positive meaning and build on that. Is that possible for others with a LL Im not sure but I did go from a complete take it or leave it mentality to having genuine interest and enjoyment in sex.  This was the first year I can ever say that I legit have had sex I considered fun. Am I ever going to ever undergo some complete sexual revolution and be my husbands perfect match? Probably not. We have met in the middle even though I thought hed continuously want more from me. Weve both done a fair amount of compromising and continue to do so. I wasnt broken or a bad person by any means I have never been a villain in our story. There was no intentional bait and switch honestly I am anything but manipulative. I could list a bunch of reasons why I think I am the way I am but at the end of the day all that matters is we found ourselves in a bad place we were two very sexually incompatible people in a marriage with kids. Everything great about our relationship was becoming lost to the one area we couldnt agree on. I did receive one of those shuttering ultimatums but maybe I needed it. He wouldnt have seriously considered leaving me if this was something he could just deal with or work through. But at the end of the day it is about you. If you are happy and content with your current relationship with sex that does not mean anything bad about you. If you want that relationship to be different maybe it can be but it would be something you would have to change for you not your SO. ,DeadBedrooms,ci3af64,2,t5_2t25p

Maybe hell get the help and motivation he needs but in the meantime stop letting him drag you into his addiction. Im guessing that he equates food with love and when you are feeling guilty or needy you help him get food right?  Stop feeding him anything but what you absolutely must and recognize how you might be catering to his addiction out of desperation for affection.  Just cut it off and bring home and offer the healthy food you want your child to learn to enjoy. It may be too late for him may be too late for your marriage but its the perfect time to model a better life for that baby. Fix absolutely everything you can on your end.

1400314,0,t3_2a4gmq,This is basically a problem only communication will solve. Youre right that being angry about it wont help... but not because its trivial its because its not constructive to getting what you want.Youll need to try to figure out as open and judgmentfree way as possible of mutually figuring out what she got out of blowing you when she seemed to want to and what is different now.In my almost year DB relationship my wife had never gone down on me and I realized it was because the power dynamics interfered with it. She could not feel that subservient to me because she always felt like she was striving for control in the relationship. Strangers she liked doing it with during the later dying stages of our relationship she insisted on opening it up. But for me it impacted too much on the person she would also need to relate to for all the life stuff involved in a marriage.Maybe it doesnt feel as right to go down on you when theres all the life and marriage baggage around it it might feel funny to get down on your knees for someone to whom you direct all the annoyances of living together being disappointed in etc.Now if its something like this I dont know what you actually do with the information but maybe its a place to start communicating...,DeadBedrooms,cirt5xr,2,t5_2t25p

1448114,0,t1_cixsbpk,I can only speculate but if you identify as LL now you were most likely always passive. You just didnt realize it because you had more of a physical drive. That or something changed along the way.If you want to become more active its a matter of selfmotivating yourself for sex. Finding reasons to want to have sex something thats selfcentered and strong enough to put forth the effort to do it. I often liken it to going to the gym  I dont feel a pressing physical urge to lift heavy weights above my head repeatedly. To be honest its quite tiring. So to motivate myself I focused on all the positives that came from going to the gym  more energy looking and feeling better etc. Eventually I started setting goals for myself  I wanted to be able to bench press a certain amount of weight  and worked towards improving my strength so that I could. I enjoyed the benefits that came from going to the gym and that motivated me enough to want to go. And eventually I also came to enjoy lifting heavy weights above my head.So ideally youd find a reason to want to have sex outside of simple physical urges. It makes you feel desired sexy you like the feeling of physical intimacy etc. Something that will motivate you to want to have it...something that will turn you on. Most of the women Ive met who liked giving oral did so because of mental reasons  it made her feel powerful in control. Women are receptive for a lot of the sex processes but this is one area where the man is the recipient and the woman is in the drivers seat.Find something about the act of sex that gives you a mentalemotional reward and let that motivate you. Let your desire come from a mental place rather than a purely physical one.,DeadBedrooms,cixspam,22,t5_2t25p

And I agree that contact leading to sex is crap a lame excuse after all we are not teenagers anymore. We know what we feel how to control things and so on.One thing I can say is that she will never accept therapy not if the proposition comes from me. Apart from being a great person some of my wifes flaws is that she is very hard headed strict and stubborn. There has been some talk in the long past that she was beatenabused by one of her few boyfriends before me. I dont know if this contributed in any way shape or form but in some aspects of life its either her way or the highway. She would see this suggestion as a blemish in the character and would not accepted to be treated. We dont have close friends where we live and in the past ten years we moved a lot so we dont someone that would help as a confidant or someone that might pass this suggestion to her. I dont believe we has discussed our relationship with anyone ever I always been a loner with very few friends even less now and due to the moves she lost contact with their good friends. The book might be an idea if I can get her to read with me. It might be a long convincing process but something that will definitely help.

Thats why it didnt make much difference when she did. This is known as a self limiting belief or a selffulfilling prophesy. One that tends to guarantee counseling wont work. then she uses her lack of progress to validate her preexisting beliefs.As people we often have a powerful need to validate our internal beliefs and see them play themselves out.

My wife had the same interpretation of my thinking during her pregnancy too.  She was huge and felt unattractive and our sex life had suffered and she tried to substitute cuddling for sex for my benefit too.  Then when I said that I was okay without sex but that I didnt want to do the cuddling snuggling things that would normally lead to sex she got pissed.      I had no problem with intimacy.  I had no problem going without sex for extended periods of time.  I understood perfectly that pregnancy required certain sacrifices and I was fine with that. What I was trying to do however was avoid getting myself turned on because that would lead to sexual frustration and resentment.  Just like if she perpetually teased me and there was never any relief.     If she needed affection support nurturing or whatever I was there.  I was happy to provide any and all of that.   But dont try to tease me tell me that its for my benefit when it had much more with assuaging your own guilt than meeting my needs and then get pissed when Im not hungry for the crumbs youre throwing me.   Honestly Im fine going without.  And if I have to do that Id rather go completely without than settle for less.  All the crumbs serve to do is whet my appetite for more.  Its better for me not to get worked up at all.  Its a personal thing maybe there are tons of guys who love going part way but Im not one especially now that Im married.     So thats what I felt.  Maybe thats what your husband is feeling too.  Youre best bet is to talk to him about it.  But the deal is you cant get pissed at him for feeling differently than you think he should.

She honestly thinks that all you want from her is sex and that youre some kind of pervert because of it. Those are problems in the way you two relate to each other about very important things not just sex problems.

1925246,0,t1_ckl5853,Yes I did use those words didnt I? I think I was hearing some idealism in your comments that struck me as immature. I am sorry if that offended you.I am  a woman if it matters. I think putting yourself into a long term committed relationship as you already have comes with responsibilities to work on that relationship. It also means sacrifice once in a while. It is easy for us to say our partner is not giving us exactly what we want therefore it is time to end the relationship. But you need to think long and hard about what you are giving up and why. You say you love your husband? I dont see that in your posts. I see a young woman in the midst of a conflict with herself over giving up on certain freedoms.Love isnt an exact science. No one is your exact match. Not even a whole group of people are going to give you everything you need. A lot of younger women think that sex and love should always be like that initial thrill but that is a Hollywood construct. Real long term relationships are a hell of a lot of work. I guess you have to ask yourself if you are up to that challenge. I have been married twenty years. Some of them good some of them bad. Ending my relationship is actually something I am considering but let me tell you it is not without a stern look at my own motivations for doing so my own psychology and my own sexual foibles. Other people cant make us happy. We are responsible for our own happiness in and out of bed. If someone is offering to give you everything they can to help you find your happiness perhaps you should look at that offer very very carefully before turning it down. ,DeadBedrooms,ckl6ffi,11,t5_2t25p

The sort of practical things you are doing sound like they are things that are good for you irrespective of what comes to fruition or not.What exactly is your wife committing to this pact though? What is her practical input or is it just a onesided arrangement? Is your wife depressed? Is she just tired with life with the domesticity? Is being a SAHM doing her in? Not everyone is cut out for it even if they were enamoured of the idea in the first place. What has her attitude been towards sex since the pair of you got together even before you got together?

There is no amount of sexy you could bring to the relationship no amount of sockfinding no amount of love no amount of gaming that you could do or could have done differently that will effect the change you want to see.. Do not believe that you can live without sex.

The quantity dropped and it bothered me but now when she does try Id rather she just didnt. The things I suggest she ignores and at that point Id rather just have some alone time than being intimate with her.I think quality is the harder of the two to resolve. Quantity requires then to put in just enough effort to get by. Remember how we use to do it a couple times a month? Id like us to spend an hour or so a week being intimate. Quality requires true desire.  Much more difficult to tell someone that the sex you are having isnt that good. Most likely they will take it the wrong way and assume its a lack of desire or the fact that you dont find them attractive. When all you really want is new positionslocationsmore foreplayoraletc.So if you are having doubts now Id watch out.

For example we had years ago watched the first season of Californication together.  The rest became available on Netflix recently and Id been holding off because shes out of town.  But with the foregoing realization I got into gear and am now way ahead and enjoying the hell out of it.  Shes welcome to catch up of course but I dont think Ill join her.,DeadBedrooms,clae1vu,1,t5_2t25p

I have a theory that if more men and women experienced more sexual partners before settling down there would be less bedrooms. All too often you hear it was great in the beginning we were each others first then it all went to hell. Men and women who have more then  or  sexual partners seem to be more on tune to what they want out of sex and more free to talk about it.

Am i correct in assuming he is not working and looks after the household and the kid? Could that be an issue. You both dont want another kid at present but he doesnt want another at all and you cannot use a highly reliable birth control method ie hormonal birth control. Is that an issue? I also concur with others who reckon that the psychological trauma of the loss of the first baby. It happens a lot more than people are prepared to recognise.You need to get the real issues out of him not the facile excuses. The problem is has he really identified and come to terms with those real reasons or is he in constant denial to himself about them?What forms of birth control have you considered and declined in total? Have you considered confronting about some of these bigger issues to see what you can get out of him? Have you contemplated asking him explicit directed questions rather than just asking him what is wrong? As an outlier would you consider sperm banking and then vasectomy as an approach to birth control? You might have problems getting doctors to agree to doing that. What about a copper IUD?

2299683,0,t1_clvvtry,This is how it appears to me as well. LL husbands especially porn addicts are given the same hairy eyeball and described as neglectful users or manchildren. Or assumed to be a homosexual using the wife as a beard.It is pretty common that a handful of posters predictably defend a female with a low libido and assume that shes a nice person who is also suffering some unspoken hurt or ill without any basis for that assumption whatsoever. Even though Im female and have faced and conquered the gamut of libido challenges from birth control thru pregnancy and endometriosis I dont automatically share that assumption that an LL wife is a good hearted wellintentioned woman with physical or emotional damage. I know at least two LL wives who are coldhearted unapologetic users. One is a very close relative with no children and terrific health no apparent reason to deny her husband sex or make fun of him for possessing an interest in her. But she does both behind his back and in front of friends and family. In fact many of the LL drivebys in this and the other forum are openly hostile and condescending to HL people. Nice warm and loving isnt what I automatically assume about someone who would leave a partner to suffer in the cold. Point being there is often no evidence to assume either the best or the worst about an absentee spouse here all we can do is honestly relate our own experiences and perspectives and hope that something strikes a chord with an OP. ,DeadBedrooms,clvygzn,6,t5_2t25p

She needs to know what her rejection is doing in case she genuinely doesnt know how its impacting you. You dont have to make your telling her into a big production or anything just stay calm and use words to describe why it is a big deal. Dont convey how big of a deal it is by yelling or anything like that because that will stress her out. Just make sure you are very clear and give her no opening for fake or real misinterpretation. Make it unavoidable and bring it all out into the light. You cant assume she already knows and if she does you dont want to allow her any more room to avoid. This is the only way to make sure youre both on the same page  and once youre there then the real work can begin therapy more communication etc. She may cry yes. But do not apologize and do not break down.

Theres no way around it.If you initiate does he go for it or is it shut down? If hes good to go if you are the one who initiates it sounds like you are just going to be initiating for a while. Knock his socks off like I suggested before is perhaps a solution. What you described about what you want is mostly what I want and most people want. Its not unreasonable really. So if you try and its not working after a month think long and hard about what you want and then discuss it with your guy.

Even if you do decide to end the relationship which sounds as if it could be the best option for you both if you really are a selfish lover and dont realise it its only going to be a problem for you further down the line.

2508500,0,t3_2od6kj,Talking as a LL there are two main reasons likely here..  She has lost physical attraction to you.  Brutally honest but this is a big cause of lack of sex in relationships for women especially when the sex life was adequate for a good portion of the beginning of the relationship.  Of course its going to be almost impossible for her to admit that  maybe even to herself and certainly to you.  But at the same time she loves you she loves being with you youre probably her best friend.  To her its still worth being with you she just has completely lost that spark and sexual chemistry.  Sometimes there isnt a solution here but things to think about  have you changed physically since you got together?  Gained weight?  Dress sloppier?  Look at a picture of yourself right before you met.  What is different?  People downplay appearance and physical attraction being important to women  but it is..  She was not that interested in sex to begin with.  The honeymoon period can be a small exception.  Your sex drive increases a bit because its exciting.  After that ends her sex drive returns to its normal state...low.  In this scenario she really just doesnt feel the need for it.  She is probably telling the truth about not masturbating or doing anything because her body doesnt crave anything sexual.  Sex is a lot of work and brings her no pleasure.  Maybe she does it for your benefit occasionally and make no mistake that takes a lot of love and giving to do when your body isnt into it.  Solutions  finding a way to activate her low sex drive  learn and tap into ANY fantasies or kinks she has and make those a dominant part of your sex life.  Learn to live with it.  Break up.  ,DeadBedrooms,cmlzz3b,6,t5_2t25p

You need to know whats the most important. I would simply start out by telling her that you are a little stressed and think you need to incorporate some me time into your daily routine to help make you a happier healthier person. This might end up cutting into some of your current together time but that you dont want to take away from that everyday and that perhaps you could work on deciding what times would be good for you to have me time and how changing some of the together time to fit in your me time would work. Then I would suggest the idea of quickies or maybe just having snuggle time if that is more important but let her be a part of the decision and discussion while making it clear that it is something that needs to happen for you to be a better partner because you will be less stressed and more receptive overall.,DeadBedrooms,cmpxdx1,4,t5_2t25p

However I would guess there are at least as many DB because the LL partner is mad about something often totally unrelated to sex and their HL partner doesnt really understandrespectdeal with the problem. ,DeadBedrooms,cnkxxo7,2,t5_2t25p

If you are happy and comfortable with no resentment for having a future sexless relationship with her for the rest of your life then I wish you both the best.If you need sex to be close to someone in a relationship like so many of us do youll be far better off to let go and find someone more compatible to you.

Most people suck at effectively communicating the full scope of their pain to their partner.The key is to. Stop trying to convince your partner of objective facts using logic and facts makes it easier to ignore you in their mind because if they disagree with your logic then they feel that what you said doesnt count. Stick to statements about what it feels like for you. Freely admit that it might not objectively be that way AND it feels this way and hurts. Statements like this are more undisputable and undismissable.... Bring it up every time you feel this way. So if you feel this way  times a day let your SO know every time! Share the pain! Hey Im feeling really hurt now that we didnt have sex last night. Im not saying that its true that we should have or not Im saying that Im in pain..

She cant be both insecure about not being able to please you while also refusing to do things you tell her would be pleasurable. Are you saying she only refuses to do these things if theres no reciprocation on your part or just that she wont do them at all? Like instead of having PIV sex you could take turns performing oral on each other? Or she wouldnt be down for that either? Unless youre also unwilling to do onesided sex acts no sex act is truly onesided but whatever for her she should be willing to take turns. You say you dont masturbate often and are not a furious masturbator so I take it you know about death grip and how that can desensitize you to vaginal sex?

He got interested when I giggled at the jokes in the beginning and then noticed that I was silently crying at some of the waytooclosetohome parts that two hour window bit?  It being about feeling loved and attractive?  Staring up at the ceiling feeling rejected and alone....  He asked what I was watching I really tried to avoid telling him because I figured he would get upset.  Hes sick of hearing about our lack of sex life too.  But he asked to watch it with me.  Granted I had to put it on at .x speed and he only got through  minutes of it  minutes at that speed.  He then said I love you baby! and got on his computer to read about guns.  I dont know how much he absorbed if hell think about it at all but hearing that my story is extremely common makes me feel less alone if not actually better.One thing that was different for me was how I handle being rejected.

2866891,0,t1_cntyd0z,Okay well I think its obvious that what people here want is not just sex but the feeling of closeness that comes with it. Thats why no amount of pity sex could ever make us happy. But I dont believe that you can get the feelings having sex gives you from anything else other than sex you know? I think the sexrelated closeness feeling is going to be a very similar yet different type of feeling than nonsexrelated closeness feeling such as from a lovely date night or your spouse taking care of you while youre sick and so on. Those things do make you feel close to your partner but not the right kind of close if that makes sense. Theyre two separate though similar things and I dont think you can make do with just one. I read a comment from uYeOldeDog that I thing sums up what Im trying to say much more succinctly gt But love cannot replace desire or viceversa. You can get or give one or the other but more usually a varied ratio of both.

2868877,0,t1_cnu6j6s,Were not all  when we fall in love and become engaged. Many of us are older experienced and have had many long term relationships prior to the one which ended up in a dead bedroom. We did talk about it. We did discuss sex our libido and ask probing questions about their libido. I did this explicitly. And my partner lied. He would say exaggerated. He might even say that he hoped he could keep up the same level and frequency we had in the beginning and didnt expect to lose his sex drive. So I reminded him of the talk how I told him in the beginning that I really loved sex and hoped to keep it up into our golden years. He shrugged. Said Its just sex. Sex isnt everything. It isnt that important. And I said Well how important is it if I sought it elsewhere? How would you feel if you only had to have sex with me a few times per month and I slipped off to have it a little more often with someone else? He blew up of course total rage. Suddenly sex was the Most Important Thing of All Time. It was an ugly ugly fight. But here is your answer to Who has the right to demand more sex? Well its the person who is expected to remain faithful to one partner. My husband wants me to be faithful and I have no problem with that. But he had to understand that he is the only person I can have sex with and I want to do it more often. Our compromise I have to be the aggressor and I have to do most of the work. Id rather he take charge now and then and he certainly gets a lot more attention than I do. Thats not fair. I miss being ravished being thrown on the bed miss being desired. But we do have sex about every other day now and its always good for both of us. Im open minded. Im uninhibited. Ill do anything he wants. But what he wants is for me to take care of all the initiating all the foreplay and direct all the positions. Okay thats my compromise. I will never again get to lay back and enjoy someones full attention on me. I won I guess? You are welcome to tell me how I failed how my actions led to our libido mismatch because I sure cant see it. Im exactly the same person I was when we were dating and fucking like bunnies. Hes not.

2879540,0,t1_cnvaxnc,Hey this might work it might not and I am sorry for being a dick about it.. Write him a letter explaining exactly how you feel about sex what it means to you when you have it and what it means to you when you dont.  The letter will prevent him from taking any nonverbal cues from you and allow him to receive your information in a completely different manner than what he is used to. Its sponatenous. The way to defeat a paradox is with a counterparadox. You must try and find a way to convince him that you are no longer interested in sex.  Say you have some new interest if he asks just tell him it doesnt involve having sex. The way it seems your husband relates to you is to do the opposite of what you want for whatever reason by doing this the only way he can not do what you want is for him to have sex with you. But you must be convincing Thus all the subterfuge devils advocacy and bluntness you saw me display I wanted you to convince yourself. You said that you tell him how hott he is straddle him and he usually deflects?  Refrain from doing so as much as you are able.  Again you are being spontaneous he will notice the change.. Stay persistent.The letter and your behavior are the most important if nothing changes in him then I believe you should evaluate whether he really wants to meet your needs or not. If he cant understand trivializes the issue jokes or jests then he is not taking your seriously as a wife and as a person.  You do not deserve that.

But its interesting reading about your relationship with a woman. She probably feels similar. I know lately now that my anxiety about sex has been raised I feel that way  trapped in my own head overanalysing everything I do afraid to take initiative.

So I dont.Were actually extremely touchy and nudityoriented despite our kindainfrequent sexual encounters and cuddle mostlynaked daily so I dont think thats a problem with us but I can definitely see why with your husband that would create some tension.

He just doesnt see the point maybe since he is goal amp solution oriented?gtSex is normal natural a sign of good health and no big deal at all to me except of course when it isnt happeningYep totally. I agree.gtI dont know how to go helping someone erase those stumbling blocks because I never had the patience to date someone with significant hangups. You are in a special position right now as the One Person who can actually help her grow into her sexuality. Thats gotta be a heavy burden on your psyche. It would sure be easier to fuck someone who finds fucking to be a fun recreational activity instead of an emotional rollercoaster.Nodding along to this. Its true. Part of me whines why cant she just have fun with it? Wouldnt it be great to be with someone who didnt cause sex to be this big anxious Problem? We all have a hangup here and there but why does it have to be so allencompassing with sex? If she loved sex and was super fun amp spontaneous but idk hated getting head that would be negative because giving is fun but at least Id feel more desired you know? I was going to ask here if you think he has hangups but you address that later. Clearly he has some sort of hangup with talking frankly about his feelings regarding sex  this strikes me as a typical problem with how men are raised to not be bleeding hearts if you know what I mean. This is an advantage for me as a lesbian since most women if close enough to you emotionally amp somewhat mature are willing to spill their guts as much as possible to work out their own issues. Obviously I am making extreme generalizations that dont apply to everyone. Do you think he takes it as fighting because of his own issues i.e. he is just uncomfortable talking about it and is like why do we bring this up all the time! or do you come across angrily? I know sometimes when Im nervous talking I speak really curtly and formally and it ironically seems like Im a very confident bitch whos looking down on you but really I am anxious and overthinking my words. Talking it out doesnt solve all our issues but it does smooth over resentment misunderstandings of one anothers intentions and so on which I think contributes to why I am able to be so patient about the problem. Theres been times when my emotions were just piling on each other in my own head for extended periods and I honestly was beginning to just convince myself to break up with her  then I go talk to her understand her better and calm down. I should put a disclaimer here though that while I appear really patient I am actually passive to a fault amp dont bring up problems enough. I rarely if ever rock the boat. Something I have been working on hard in this relationship.Honestly in a way Im glad that my SOs issues are a hangup and not just low libido. I mean her libido IS lower and more reactive than mine but I think it wouldnt be so dramatic if we get more comfortable and work through her anxieties. I kind of wish shed see a therapist about it but shes really resistant to that idea shell do counselling about some things but some things she cant open up to a stranger about like sex. But the way I see it libido is not exactly immutable but might as well be from an outsiders perspective  I cant just make her want sex more if she just well doesnt. In that case IMO its more cutanddry she simply is incompatible with me. But in reality she has this complex anxiety thing about sex that she has actively been improving on lately. Still kind of a drag for me but I have my own issues about sex and about other things insecurities etc that she puts up with and helps me through  just part of being flawed people. A big part of what keeps me going is that she acknowledges without prompting from me that she has problems about sex that she hopes to continue to fix  Im never made to feel like this is just how she is and that I shouldnt try to change her or that my libido is the problem. RE Spanking I think it will be a while yet before we manage to get through it well but she did express interest in learning to tie ropes so I might try to incorporate it when we eventually experiment with that. I think ropetying could be really perfect because its a dedication of time to this erotic and touchy act that isnt necessarily sex and I could be like hey how about we see what its like to do x while youre tied? and take turns that way. But I will DEFINITELY let you know how that goes lmao.,DeadBedrooms,cocb20q,1,t5_2t25p

Trust and communication would include him understanding that he made an agreement with you regarding sexual frequency. Understanding how important being intimate is for you.So I wouldnt exactly call that trust and communication if he thought he could get you to marry him just by increasing sex for a short period of time.It just seems that there is so much abuse of the ideas that marriage and love are based on. That is to put your SOs needs before your own. And to understand in a mismatched libido environment that it is always a work in progress. Relationships require work. They dont look after themselves.Youre in the same boat as many others. Everything else is great except for the intimacy. But most of these people didnt sign up to marry their friend or roommate.He is not on the same page as you. He clearly does not understand nor respect how important this is to you. Counseling is important because your feelings will not go away. Otherwise you will need to find a way to put them aside if you want to be happy in your marriage. ,DeadBedrooms,coh07c8,2,t5_2t25p

3097389,0,t1_coin4bo,Yeah. I used to only be able to cum from  minutes of oral. But in the last few years I have been getting better at cumming from PIV. When he and I first started dating it was wonderful and I came easily and often still not every time but Im completely used to that by now... I used to cum never but it slowed. I never needed much from him except for some stamina and time and some foreplay and how excited he made me was usually more than enough to make PIV explosive. Id occasionally ask him if oral was just not his thing and he said he had no problem with it I had just never asked for it. So once in a while I would ask for it and it just definitely wasnt the oral I had been accustomed to in a past relationship which was one of the only things to make me cum as hard as I had learned to on his dick. I didnt know how to tell him Okay now I need you to be a completely orally fixated pussy monster.

3218463,0,t1_coviujx,This may be long so my apologies. Brevity is not my strong suit.When I first started lurking in DB I kept seeing posts by people blaming medications for their problems. I thought it was bullshit just an excuse to hang the problem on. For me thats precisely what it was.In a routine medical exam I was diagnosed with borderlinelow thyroid hypothyroidism. I was given a prescription for a minimal dose of a thyroid supplement. I figured it might help my feeling of always being tired. It did far more than that.Within  days of starting the Rx I underwent a profound emotional change. The anger and bitterness that filled my daily thoughts for years simply...went away. Before when something irritated me I would dwell on it it would obsess me for days. That simply stopped. I still get irritated but it doesnt consume me. Im getting pleasure out of things now. I can smile again. I can love my wife again. I got up at am this morning to drive her to work. In the past when Ive done that it always pissed me off that I had to get up that early and I resented her asking. Today I didnt mind doing that for her and we talked and laughed on the ride. Just before she got out of the car she gave me a quick kiss and said I like being with you. Just as importantly I like being with me now something I hadnt felt in a long time.What was it like for me before? Heres the best approximation I can give Imagine that youre living in a small room. Over a long time the lights in the room keep getting dimmer but its so gradual that you dont notice and eventually youre in complete darkness. Then all of a sudden someone opens the shade and sunlight streams in. You can see again and you realize how small and shabby that room is. You realize that theres life outside that fucking room and you dont have to stay there any more. It sounds corny so corny that I only told my wife after some prompting and this is the first time Ive ever stated it publicly. Im not a touchyfeely kind of guy and writing stuff like this is kind of embarrassing to me and no doubt boring to readers. One thing I am sure of is that Ill never go back in that room. Ill die first. It really was that bad. If your husbands in a similar room he may not even know it.There is no medical evidence to support that thyroid supplements can affect moods but it does supposedly relieve depression. I never thought I was depressed but maybe my anger and bitterness came from depression?  I honestly dont know. My hypothyroidism was borderline low and it was a coin toss by my doctor as to whether or not to treat it. He made the right call.Why am I in DB? Simple. The last ten years that bedroom was completely dead and it was in a coma for the previous ten. Naturally I blamed my wife for not initiating not fixing it. I can honestly say she very rarely declined sex with me. She was always willing even when it was painful for her. I built the dead bedroom not her. Im here in DB because Im still having some functional issues there and Im trying to work through them.OP I dont want to give you false hope that would be cruel. Theres probably no magical pill that will fix your husband. Thats why I think of my case as hitting the lottery. Pure luck.

3387234,0,t1_cpdu1br,The problem is the property that we bought has the facilities on it that are required to operate her business without it she would not be able to operate and so aside from loosing the relationship she has had her entire adult life and even before she would also loose her entire career. There would be pieces that could be salvaged but it would be a huge step back from her one I doubt she would ever fully recover from.There are other issues around the property and where we bought it it favours her heavily which is problematic but our reasons for buying here were solid at least from her point of view. For reasons too complicated and largely irrelevant to go into this is the location that was required for her business but in reality it may have been a convenient excuse to be as near to her mother as possible whom she was and is highly dependant on.Its not all bad however The business is showing significant and quantifiable progress and she is truly committed to making it a success working quite hard to do so. The issue there however is that she cannot do it alone and I am doing a significant amount of the legwork on the side to keep her from going under. This is all well and good however she also has a large amount of emotional support needs requiring me to spend almost all the time I have with her or for her leaving me little time to pursue my own endeavours. This becomes problematic in that I need a bit of alone time most days to reset and deal with the stress of my life to escape mostly using various forms of electronic entertainment. As I do not have enough time I am forced to pick and choose between the requirements I have and when she comes off second best on those choices she sees it as me pushing her away and becomes hurt furthering the image in my mind that I have of her being a burden.All of this is painting her in a light I would not normally use however as has been said elsewhere particularly in the post by uinpurgatorium  I could go on for days about her virtues the problem with this discussion is that they are largely irrelevant to this discussion so and so perhaps you see her through a different lens.Given this I feel that the potential for our relationship is high. We have a solid plan for the future financial independence is within our grasp and if we play our cards right we can enjoy most of what the world has to offer.

3389971,0,t1_cpe5im9,This is just coming from my own perspective but Im sure other women have felt the same.  At  I wasnt fully sexually developed.  Physically sure.  But not ready for as much as early as perhaps some other people are.  Lots of women arent exposed to porn as much or masturbation and still by  are very unaware of whats out there what they might want to try etc because I was still just perfecting how to use a tampon and my idea of sex came from Hollywood movies kissing cuddling etc...not porn.  So my guess is that lots of other young women are like that too.  So expecting these women youre dating you and OP to walk into a relationship at  and be wild sex goddesses who know what they want and how they want it and want it all the time...might be premature.

3524334,0,t1_cptymdc,It was incredibly frustrating.My libido started dropping when I was about  years old. Considering where I started it was getting kind of normal at that point. It wasnt until about  years old that it started to get bad. About  years old when it got downright ridiculous. At  years old it went away entirely.I started trying with doctors when it started getting weird. At ish the doctors basically said the issue was that I wasnt a teenager anymore and this was normal. It seemed reasonable to want sex only  times a week so I went along with this. I was disappointed that I couldnt get insanely turned on anymore but I figured such was life.By about  years old I was getting seriously upset about this. Id gotten an IUD at  so I thought maybe its the IUDs fault nevermind that I couldnt find any evidence to back up such a correlation. I made a doctor remove it and... it didnt help. I pushed doctors about it but theyd only refer me to counseling saying it must be in my head must be my relationship even though I couldnt even get turned on by porn anymore. I live in Canada and we had no mental health coverage. So I could do nothing. They wouldnt even look into trying anything else until I got fully evaluated through psych stuff they refused to consider it might be anything else. I couldnt even get tested for something else.So for years I did my best.By  years old wed moved to a fully open relationship. I remember talking to a friend of mine who was hard up and really unsure about being with a married man. I broke down crying while talking to her telling her that I wanted him to experience someone wanting him again even if it couldnt be me. She ended up being too shy to go through with it. Hes been with a couple of women but after about a year he decided its not worth it. He prefers a woman who isnt interested in sex but loves him as a sexual partner over someone whos just interested in sex. It was a lot of fun though  we had ways and everything and I had a few guy partners picking up some new techniques which my husband definitely liked.Then I got pregnant at . My hormones went CRAZY. Obviously. And heres the wild part  for a few precious months in the middle of my nd trimester my libido was back!! I pounced him like you wouldnt believe. I wore him out. Oh man it was amazing.Then it faded away again as the third trimester and birth happened. I kept hoping that the pregnancy reset my system and maybe itd come back after the hardships of pregnancybirth. Then... maybe itll come back after I stop breastfeeding. Then... maybe a few months after breastfeeding?Then obviously its not coming back. But equally obviously this isnt a relationship problem!I brought the case to the doctor and told him about those amazing few months telling him that this is proof its not in my head and Im going to fix this and hes going to help. He referred me to an OBGYN.  months later I talked to her had the same convo. She sent me to get tested.  months later I get the results back. Crazy low estrogen! She prescribes me an estrogen based birth control and sets an appointment for  months later. It doesnt work but online research suggests that if my estrogen levels are low my problem is that my androgens are also low and I most likely need a combo of estrogen and testosterone. The day before my appointment comes and... she calls in sick. So my appointment was pushed back another  months.Sigh. A month and a half to go.Best I can suggest is to support her remind her that shes not crazy remind her that its perfectly acceptable to want to feel like having sex and any doctor who says otherwise needs to be kicked in the ballsovaries. Address the relationship side for sure but if shes convinced its physical... just fight for it.Good luck. Hopefully my story helps.,DeadBedrooms,cptzzj8,21,t5_2t25p

Ours is a high risk specialty practice and on top of that in the last five years the rate of babies born addicted to barbiturates and opiates has shot up to the nd highest in the nation. I cant say anything else about that but this is no place for me. As far as Big Pharma goes its more about the risky side effects and the incredibly limiting field of help for women. Viagra though Cialis those things have been around for  decades and men of all ages get to enjoy the benefits of those miracle drugs. The testosterone cream for women is still considered the last hurrah for menopausal women. But menopausal women dont seem to have as much trouble with this as young moms from  to . But of course the risk to harming fertility is too great so its just not a magic bullet. And thats what we really need. A nonhormonal magic bullet. If anyone is testing it I havent heard about it. My docs do the same though they suggest therapy very gently because we have a religious diversity issue in the south to be wary of. Im glad Im not in their position to try to encourage someone whose inhibitions are likely born of religion to seek counsel from their church which is likely to tell them Buck up sister sex is for the head of the household. Its just the touchiest  subject and its obvious why women who ask for help dont feel as if they get any. The whole process for men is so much simpler. Quick health exam walk out with a script. I wonder if male ED patients are even asked the relationship questions. Ultimately what Im saying with my post isnt that its hopeless because it isnt. Some women can find help via counseling marital counseling regular exercise. But medicine is sadly limited in this area. We are other women that is the best resource we have. We can share what worked for us and encourage one another to make this a female priority.

Often Ill think about the times I was truly disappointed by the reality of something I had only dreamed about before or the times I regretted sacrificing something permanent for a shortlived experience.  Perspective helps immensely.Learning to be happy for me is about finding balance between keeping my feet on the ground and having my head in the clouds.

You would refuse to accept forced celibacy for the rest of your life because she was cheating on you right?  Why accept it because she isnt?  You are just as much out in the cold either way.  Whether or not she is cheating with someone else what she is cheating YOU out of is your life.  You only get one.  Dont waste it.

I went so long trying to get her to show interest and then giving up that I just decided to stop seeing her that way or it just happened naturally.  If she all of a sudden showed interest Im not sure I would even be interested.  I doubt Id refuse but Id be very guarded and assume it was temporary or not real.

3822926,0,t1_cqrx307,Seeking to end an arrangement lets call it marriage doesnt have to be dependent on the other person being an asshole they can just be incapable.My first boss  a serious misogynistic egotistical authoritarian sacked an employee after they had exhausted their entitlement to sickpay and had been off work for more than  months. Everyone believed that they were swinging the lead but would do nothing about it so he dismissed them. Of course they objected saying he couldnt sack them while they were sick. He said he could because they were clearly no longer competent to do the job and there was no indication available that they would ever be competent to do the job again.You will probably think the analogy is an unfair one but the fact is that irrespective of the reason some relationships will simply not work out. The OPs wife cannot make the grade and just as importantly he cant sustain what it would take to keep on trying to believe in their relationship. Reading between the lines the problem the OP has with the situation is really no longer just about the lack of sex but the fact that he has basically lost any trust and respect for his partner and if anything regards her as a to be pitied invalid. Where does the relationship realistically go from the on that basis? Sometimes things just get irrevocably broken and their is no putting them back together again. While he remains the resentment grows and in all probability her anxiety stress and misery grows.

4034105,0,t3_36i13a,I dont think the rape you suffered as a girl would be factoring quite as high in your association with your marital sex were you having good sex. Meaning sex thats not exclusively dickcentric and so similar to the kind that happened to you and despite you when you were . Of course youre drawing parallels! Of course it feels repulsive! Its almost the same physical experience. Your refutation of your husband isnt personal though Im sure he feels like it and not entirely without justification. Youre turning down  that long ago nightmare. That selfish manboy who violated you and refused to consider you. You two need to sit down and discuss what it will take to start having the kind of  sex that lovers are supposed to have vs the effed up bastardized version our culture has spoon fed us. Without blame or judgment. Its one of the few things our parents and mentors dont pass on knowledge about to their children freely and openly and explicitly in the way they do with nearly everything else and as a result weve barely grown in our widespread sexual knowledge as a culture. The same sexual misinformation gets perpetuated from generation to generation now simply cemented as normal and anything outside of that is viewed as radical. Even deviant. Or gasp! The F word Feminist!  Stuff and nonsense! Why do you think so many couples have sexual issues despite our species being so clearly hardwired to love and seek sex? Because we arent doing it right! First off the learning curve is steep initially. Men resist the ideas at first they sound like too much work and women are too preconditioned in part thanks to the virgin whore dichotomy to be demure self conscious pleasers or overacting performing porn star pleasers that the true way to mutual satisfaction requires an initial breaking down of your existing sexual conduct with one another. Thats..Its hard. The hardest part imo. warning Im going to get graphic now Were all adults here right? I dont speak vajayjay and peepee sorry. With that being said...The next biggest hurdle is the first attempts at getting you to come properly.  Your man goes down on you it takes two stinking hours your clitoris is throbbing yet weirdly numb the poor guy has tmj by the time he collapses his numb face on your clenched contracting belly  and you havent come despite having hovered agonizingly on the edge of release nearly the whole time! Youre now overfull of unsated sexual energy and highly emotional feeling both guilty and frustrated and you both conclude that youre probably broken. It appears to take you inordinately long. Except you know it doesnt because you can come on your own in minutes and repeatedly. So then your man feels inadequate. This isnt a sustainable formula. You feel like a difficult case and so get even more psyched out the next time you try and despite your empassioned breathy sincere pleas of oh god Im almost there! The same damn thing happens.He just goes faster next time then turns his head into a frigging machine pushes harder on your tenderest tissue with his tongue and lips sticks fingers in assorted offices moves them too hard and fast and though this occassionally gets some women off out of sheer force of will and marathon physical hypersensory explosion... its so not ideal.So what gives? Ha.Womens main sex organ is the brain.And Im going to talk as if both partners are here now okay? You need to talk and flirt during the day in messenger on your phones or pcs while away or maybe just throughout the evening you show her a demonstrative display of desire with praise specific to her and a carnal sincere need for her expressly not I need it but I need you. You honestly say you want  to take your pleasure and to give her hers they are intrinsically linked. Be as specific as you two are comfortable with and laugh and forgive each other if you misstep on the vocabulary choices initially  Tell her her labia are beautiful in your words because women are so terribly self conscious of our genitalia. Were told our whole lives  since little girls to close your legs sit like a lady essentially to hide our privates like theyre something shameful to  possess.  Later we hear constant talk about disgusting menstruation horrifying childbirth stinky pussy jokes awful nicknames for our parts etc etc.. Its one of the biggest reasons we cant let go and orgasm with you! Believe it. So say what youd   like to do with her lips that she smells sexy hot  and that youll  enjoy doing it until shes happy no pressure. Remember this kind of talk is for breaking down a lifetime of  possible self loathing. She doesnt want you to be grossed out! She cares about what you think so much that shed deny her own pleasure by refusing you close access! Then when youre actually engaged in the act of oral sexIf its taking too long youre both both feeling it is btw that means shes lost her mental connection with you. You have to stop come back up to her face and talk again. Touch her tummy thighs inner forearms fingertips and then labia softly like youd stroke an eyelid or a piece of velvet not the way youd buff a scratch off your fiberglass while you talk your awesomeness again.Let her use a vibrator to get herself off in your presence if she will  ladies just do it sometimes while you suck her nipples earlobes and passionately kiss her mouth. Talk but dont ask questions. if she has to keep answering you she cant focus on coming. A lot of men get stuck on does that feel good?. Try to make statements instead. Maybe you can simply provide a visual aid jack yourself off where she can see you while she does herself. Sound crazy? No its damn hot and non threatening. And for her part...  ladies you have to exit your head and go into la la land like you do when masturbating. Fuck how your belly looks cover it with a little black slip if its truly causing you distress but get over it eventually because confidence is sexy to your man just as it is to you forget making obvious noises just to keep him encouraged they can sabotage you if theyre not utterly from your subconscious depths. Let him know that if you go quiet or stop bucking it means hes so damn good hes literally put you into a trance and not to worry youll come back and likely ride him senseless afterward. Men when she comes like this from something youve done..the rest of the sex is through the roof. Her self consciousness plummets after a big O her love and desire for you goes up. She might even cry from release. Our orgasms last longer than yours and we can fire em off consecutively! Were built for pleasure! Then afterward stroke her skin and tell her why she was awesome in details again specific to her. Cup her swollen lips in your palm and just hold them comfortingly as you talk about her body her face the session.    This only needs to be for a few minutes okay? Dont worry we know you need to pass out its biochemical.  We are so emotional after you satisfy us. Its a beautiful time for connecting you two are the only people in the universe at this moment of suspended animation when the hell does that ever happen?  A few minutes investment of this tenderness and gratitude will do wonders to reinvest in the next session! Cause youre thinking wait wheres my bj?!  Lol Dont worry. Youve established trust now.And if she doesnt come if there are setbacks dont panic and over analyze. It will take time for both of you to figure out her particular way. This sounds hard doesnt it? Too much hassle? Well I suppose you can stay in your sexless or ho hum situation then. Because thats not work at all.  Sorry for the sarcasm but seriously..So there are great books and soso books and crap books on this stuff. Try lots. My two faves are She Comes First Its a tough one for a lot of men to handle at first and does spend too much time on cunnilingus hyper technique but you can warn hubs about that in advance and then the second is Tickle His Pickle. Ladies want to do right by their men too and we havent been taught either! Start there. Watch some Ted talks on sex too. Theyre free on youtube and they run the gamut of subject matter.  Often they gently reveal to men how theyve been duped by their own culture into thinking sex is something it isnt. Its okay though we all have been misled.And mostly praise each other. Be kind! Men and women both have fears of inadequacy.Be as specific in your speech as possible! Shame is intrinsic in sex so both sexes need positive reinforcement specific to us. Not generic you look great statements. Like the dimple at the top of your ass crack is cute I want to kiss it and I love it when you pull down on my balls while sucking the head youre really good at that or your pubic hair looks sexy shaved in that shape god honey you feel so good. I love watching you come. You look like a damn goddess.To men from women you blew my mind. No one has ever made me feel like that. I had a huge orgasm oh my god youre so good at pleasing me you have a sexy cock etc Just be genuine.Take time as often as possible to read a chapter or two of a sex book together at night. All different kinds. How else will you learn anything new? Plus  reading horns women up. Even fiction. ahem duhThere are so many ways to correct course with two willing partners. Hopefully hell be willing to learn for you if it means awesome sex is on the horizon. God at least you know he wants you. Thats a great start that many of us here are envious of. cough me  And for you you can finally dissasociate that long ago assault from your internal definition of sex. Remember to praise him too when hes obviously trying. Good luck.  ,DeadBedrooms,crg4aae,2,t5_2t25p

I cant say if its enough of a compromise though. I got my wife to a point where she wouldnt say no unless she had a really good reason to but for me that wasnt really what I wanted. I want a partner who likes and enjoys it just as much as I do not one that will just say yes out of obligation.gt I never ever saw those things as selfish just my rights as a human beingI think this is how most of our LL partners approach things. Our default is I shouldnt have to have sex if I dont want to! and yes you can argue that is a basic right as a human being. You are  free to make that choice. Of course that choice has a profound effect on your husband which you shouldhave to consider.

We tried to have a conversation today about the state of things and he just insists we have bad timing and opposite hours.  Im sorry but thats whats had us have sex only once this year?  No I dont accept that.  It was never the problem before.  There is something that he just doesnt want to deal with right now.  Has to be.Also I just wont leave.  Thats all there is to it.  It took time for things to devolve they way they have and maybe down the road theyll evolve into something better.

That scenario is the only way she can want sex because she has anxiety about it. Explanation C She actually did want sex and the timing is really just unfortunate.  Her comment in the morning was callous and shows that she doesnt understand the pain youre in. Explanation D Shes lying and is cruel.The reality is most likely some combination of those.  You know the psychological effect that a Dead Bedroom has on the HL partner but you should also be aware of the effect it has on the LL partner.For example my LL wife has some confidence issues stemming from what she perceives as constant pressure to have sex.

Most of our experiences were good and even when they werent it served to contrast what we appreciated in one another sexually and otherwise.  I was always of the mind that jealousy in small controlled consensual doses was a positive thing.  Jealously brings just how much you care about your partner into sharp focus.  Overall my main takeaway from it has been while I enjoy special occasion extrarelationship stuff vacation a previous sexy fling comes to town for one night only comforting someone special in your life Im mostly done sleeping around.  Its much more relaxing to be with your so the loving feeling cant be attained with anyone else.  The comfort the easy way between you the pleasure.Honestly I cant see the open relationship method giving you everything you are lacking in your relationship without you forming bonds with other women which may not be a bad thing overall but you should know going into it what youre risking.

We were always fighting and I constantly felt pressured for sex. When we did have sex it was bad and no amount of talking to him and sharing my desires fixed the problem. There was a very large age gap as well...I am  and he is . He also had ED so that created a problem when I was trying to initiate and he physically couldnt have sex. I knew he was unhappy and he knew I was unhappy and we ended up breaking up. I have a new boyfriend now who im head over heels for and I dont have any libido problems with him.

Intimate really just means close meaningful and private and assuming its always sexual is just the upshot of people appropriating a more socially acceptable term  prissy really  for something theyre uncomfortable being explicit about. A bit like saying passed when you mean died.And you can relatively unintimate sex HJ from a prostitute for instance or share an intimate moment over something intensely meaningful and personal with a family member.So on that basis  a meeting of eyes across a room with my wife could be intimate or a romantic meal out or cuddling watching TV or intense sex.This might all seem pedantic but I think unpicking semantics can highlight the assumptions behind things we say. In this case  this particular HL doesnt necessarily mean he misses sex when he says he misses intimacy. He means he misses intimacy and sex is one particularly intense kind of intimacy.,DeadBedrooms,cs74q5l,8,t5_2t25p

NORMAL.That said what made you think you had a reasonable expectation for fullon sex given your past?  At this point in your relationship did you honestly think that physical intimacy was a natural course of events.  It is obviously a stressful thing to her it is obviously stressful to you.  But at the same time Im reading that you put your daughter to bed as usual.  This is where you have to learn to create an environment conducive to your desires.  Hire a babysitter.  Arrange a sleep over.  Dont expect she will do that because not doing that creates a safe space for your spouse that discourages physical intimacy.  LL and HL exists and it is real.  The LL desires emotional intimacy while the HL desires physical intimacy.

4481400,0,t3_3cfuut,Can i ask you a question? Why do you feel the need to be with him? Why do you reassure him that you wont go anywhere?Alright two points come to my head after reading everythingMy first pointhe is not as bold as you and respects you in his own way to the point he cannot say  i want to fuck you He would rather say i think about being with youHe wants the relationship to remain exclusive that is his right. If he isnt as unconventional and cannot share you with other guys well he is a down right old school guy. Nothing wrong with that.He is masturbating but not approaching you for sex despite his limitation thats HIS problem NOT yours. You do not have to suffer sexless and he is NOT trapping you. YOU are trapping yourself by staying in this relationship.Sure you had scars that needed healing and he fit the bill you have progressed and become a better improved version of yourself while he probably is dealing with his own insecurities and demons.He is definitely NOT in the same place as you and it sounds like he really loves you but for some reason cannot satisfy you sexually.Alright my second point coming on to youYou seem to be in a good place mentally and want to get satisfied some place else believe me he is RIGHT it always ends badly even if it is an open relationship and he certainly does not sound open minded enough to go against the societal norms.So you are left with three options you stay with him on his terms of exclusivity because that is just the way things are dick wise with him. I am sure he is great otherwise and is only lacking in this department. He loves you alot and does not want an open relationship does not want his woman to be shared or to be fucked by other men so she can get satisfied. I mean come on can you for one second imagine what kind of havoc that would wreak on him? He is already SO INSECURE and you have to keep on reassuring him you wont go anywhere what do you expect to happen afterwards if by some miracle he ever agrees and you get to sleep with other men??? You think he is going to be super cool about everything? Honestly i think hed be devastated wont be able to handle that. He has made it clear to you. you part ways with him. Everyone comes into your life for a reason and perhaps his reason for being there has finished.I know you love him alot  infact you love him to the point to bear through with all the useless dick stuff it is bugging you you want him to fk you but he is just DEAD in that area. you fuck around without him knowing. I do not advocate this option.But this way you get satisfied he is left in the dark and it does not add to his insecurities you get to stay with him in this relationship.Lastly i mean i know sexual stuff is frustrating and there are limits to what you can tolerate in terms of deadness. It all boils down to how much you love this guy. Enough to withstand his dead sexless behaviour and remain loyal? Because every relationship has problems and his problem is his dick i guess. For you to ask him  hey honey i am going elsewhere to get some but i WILL NOT EVER LEAVE YOU ! do not worry im all yours is really pushing it and not fair to him.  When you do not like something about someone you either stick it out to the best you are capable of or you leave.It sounds like you have reached your end point. It is time to leave no matter how difficult it may be before you break each others heart by doing something awful. Leave cleanly.,DeadBedrooms,csvjprn,1,t5_2t25p

I lay there with absolute unabated fury disappointment sadness swirling in my head. This is more common than you may think. The LL can be so hypersensitive and touchy that they just fly off the handle at even the slightest oversight or misunderstanding. As a result the HL often to has to walk on eggshells around them for fear of upsetting them.

I had to learn the harsh reality about female attraction I had to work on myself I had to set definite goals and work toward them I had to stop engaging in arguments ie not yelling not being extremely sarcastic stop letting her verbal button pressing affect me I no longer tolerate disrespect from her dont disrespect me is enough and if she continued as she did a few times by testing my limits so I just took my dog out for a walk I had to stop telling her how I felt and simply tell her I approve or disapprove when she brings a problem to me I set a time limit of when I expected things to be turned around and was clear that if things didnt change I would leave dread game.      Im not sure which one if it was one thing that worked but Ive been working on myself for  weeks now. A week ago she initiated with me. This was after only having sex  times in  months since our new baby was born and  straight months of no sex. We had sex again last night.      And we both had have? HL mine slightly higher than hers. Weve been married  years now and historically we had sex at least  times a week every day while she was pregnant.      She shut it all down after the baby was born with no explanation.      Finally found out that she has vaginismus. She did nothing to try and fix it for months. Of course I was bitter. The clincher came when she said after  months of no sex that all you want from me is sex. I laughed in her face and told her that was demonstrably not true as I stuck around with no explanation about the dry spell for  months at that point.       Still at a loss I found this subreddit rrelationships and another one I will not mention here other than to say it is a pit full of misogynist slime for the most part but some of the tips obviously worked.      She was literally shocked when I left for a night I was planning on staying gone but I missed her and the kids so much.       I had to repeat to her about  times after I told her I was unhappy and she thought things were fine that she was content because her needs were being met my needs were not being met and nothing had changed. Words are wind and actions always speak louder than words. I made it clear that her constant rejections and rationalizations were not acceptable because she wasnt just rejecting sex she was rejecting me and my love.       Now when I do not do what she asks she says We both have to compromise to make this work which shows me that she sees some value in me and is willing to work on her things. But to initiate that change in her I had to prove my value first. ,DeadBedrooms,ctl6y9h,5,t5_2t25p

4759508,0,t1_ctugpsj,Ive wondered that too before.  I tend to believe she honestly doesnt want to stop feeling that warm connection at night with our son but that with her brain wired to those motherly feelings its now just weird trying to adjust to having her husband by her side instead.  I get that but it still doesnt excuse how turned off she gets to the idea of receiving a kiss.For a long time I was terrified I figured she must be having an affair to be so reluctant to be intimate with me but the more time that passes it really does appear like she has zero sex drive.I told her today that I know her sex drive isnt dead you dont go from having sex toys while we were dating to feeling nothing at all now she insists though she feels no attraction to anyone  but in the back of my mind I still think yea ok if Brad Pitt or one of your other past celebrity crushes approached you and said lets fuck and I wasnt in the picture would you honestly decline..  I have to believe it boils down to either something hormonal or just a result of her putting up all these shields for some ungodly reason.Shes told me she never wants me to touch her breasts I cant even look at them really ever because of her interactions with our son.  I like to remind her that after only about two weeks of dating we were showering together but now after  years as a couple when I propose we ever shower together she gets uncomfortable almost repulsed by the thought she told me its different now that it was easier when I was just a boyfriend.Well here I go getting enraged again just thinking about that statement.

4764292,0,t3_3g32p1,Listen ProlificCerealEaterYou are really too close to your problem your wife.Read back through your original post and your subsequent responses to others. Your problem is not a lack of sex. Your problem is that you are married to a woman with multiple deep psychological dysfunctions. I could go through them again and list them one by one but you are an intelligent guy. Just remove yourself emotionally for a moment and tot them up starting with the abusive way she nitpicks at you about minor mishaps mishaps that happen to us all all the time. As an aside does she berate herself in the same way?You havent got a sex problem you have got a person problem. Ill bet a penny to a pound that if she ever takes up with sex again it wont be with you and you will be the last to know who she has taken up with unless she is brazen enough to just conduct affairs in public and then when you complain about it she will complain about why have you got a problem with it especially as she said you could cheat on her. I know a guy who this happened to a church minister. His wife was a psycho even her own father and mother disowned her eventually. What is the background to her upbringing? There is something really wrong there.You were attracted to her wild individualistic character in the beginning. The only trouble is you have no control over it nor does she.

4881780,0,t1_cu9v229,gt My guess you cut ties with them.No cant say that I did.  Honestly I tend to be less judgmental so I figured if they were happy with their lives it wasnt for me to judge.  If they said a stupid sermon well thats their issue not mine.  BUT... that was nearly fifteen years ago and at the time my husband didnt tell me all the stories growing up that I know now.  I didnt have any idea how they would nearly break my marriage or how their views would impact my sex life... how could I?  My husband left home at  and never looked back.   Why would I think he was holding on to ideas  even unconsciously.  But being raised in what can only be described as a cult apparently has a lasting impact.  So we are trying to figure out terms to deal with them.  For a while as my husband and I were dealing with all of this he actually wasnt talking with them at all.  Now things are getting a little better.  But both of us are still angry.    They seem to know something is up but not what.  I dont know what will happen.Honestly I think they will cut me  us off eventually. Basically I have seen things I cant unsee and now I can no longer tolerate those behaviors in front of me my husband or my kids.  So I plan to be clear but firm about what has to change as things come up.  For instance they have complained to my husband about my clothing in the past being inappropriate.  To avoid confrontation I adapted.  That will no longer be acceptable.  Not complaining to my husband behind my back not basically calling me a slut to my husband not anything like that even a little bit.  Now it doesnt happen often because we live far apart but they want to come visit and for a year we have just said no to avoid a fight.  One day we will say yes and then we will have to have all this out.  I am guessing that eventually they will just cut us off.  But thats on them.  BUT in our minds our marriage was the thing we needed to work on.  Getting mixed up in a fight with my husbands parents when we had so much to work out just was not something either of us thought was a good idea.  Weve had a lot happen in the last two years.  Basically two years ago a doctor put him on medication that made him paranoid and delusional for almost a year  during that time it turns out that his parents influence made a bad situation way worse... when I finally realized what was happening and convinced him to stop taking the medication I had no idea it would take longer to deal with the withdrawal than the time he was on it.  That next year I had to basically remind him of our past because he had lost so much familiarity with his own sense of reality.  That of course meant we had to honestly talk about a lot of things so that year was when we also started working through all of our DB issues and discovered deeper roots that I never expected.  So it was not the time to address my inlaws.  TLDR The day of reckoning is not yet upon us!  But it will come.,DeadBedrooms,cu9vwtx,1,t5_2t25p

5056594,0,t1_cuvcegi,Haha... I dont know yet!  Thats why Im still hanging around on rdeadbedrooms I guess P  Trying to get some insight into why my husband who Im pretty convinced is still in love with me like I am with him may have lost his libido.  My best explanation is that he doesnt feel like a sexual creature right now due to body confidence among other maybe lessimportant factors.  When I try to touch him in a sexy way I think he does clam up and feel uncomfortable in a very similar way to the OP.  So for me it was useful to hear that because I certainly dont want to make him feel uncomfortable and bring more negative feelings to sex between us.

The therapist cannot advocate for someone with lowno libido to have more sex.  Consent is king always.  So the therapist has a couple of options depending on the situation and their training.  One of them is to cater to the LL long enough to determine if there is anything that gtcanlt change.  If the pressure is taken away and the LL still cant step up then the its time to explain to the HL partner that its not going to happen.  This gets even murkier if the LL is financially dependent on the HL because then the therapist may define do no harm as let the HL carry the entire burden.  Life isnt fair.  Never was never will be.  The reality of couples therapy is that its not a negotiation at all.  The lower extreme has all of the power and makes all of the decisions.

If pleasing you is not important to her then how could you even have a longterm relationship with her? A good SO makes sacrifices for their partner she appears unwilling to do that. You might want to let her know how much the rejection hurts you. This worked with my wife at least for the shortterm. You might also mention in all honesty that youre not sure how much longer you can take the hurt. Of course once you open this can of worms youll never know if the intimacy she offers thereafter is genuine or not.

No one wants to stay in obligation sex zone  but it is better than deadbedroom and it gives you a place to try new things bring in some toys fun etc. For many women the start is almost always obligation but they eventually get into it.gt  or give zero shits because she knows I wont stray so who cares what I need sexually.You care what you need sexually. That becomes apparent when you tell her masturbation to porn is no longer good enough for you. My wife was complaining once about me hitting on her so much. I responded with When I stop hitting on you that is when you should worry.And thats the truth of it. If she says no and you say OK and then go out for a few hours it communicates to her that you have options. I am not saying cheat on your wife.

5324042,0,t1_cvs6zzz,You are in the wrong sub to learn how to play hard ball. And yes paying hard ball is what you will need to do. Dont underestimate how hard it is though. If its as you say then instead of saying you dont want cuddles unless they come with a large dose of sex just get up and leave the bed. Note  this is not the advice that the hard ball crew would give. You are your own worst enemy here. When you play hard ball for real it works but you are gonna be the one who endures the pain. Playing hard ball the way we do in our sub is a tough process for men to follow but if they do it right their wives dont experience nearly so much emotional pain as the men. In your case you just needed to escalate that situation physically. If it didnt lead to sex then you are doing something wrong. That is fact. Your wife your situation you  none of those things are special. Maybe you dont know how to escalate? Appropriately not rapey. Lots of help available for your situation if you know where to look. Hint  asking people in dead bedrooms how to fix a dead bedroom is like asking a cat how to be a dog. Cats know how to be cats and can describe what a dog looks like to them but cannot tell you how to BE a dog.

Meaning weve had sex twice in the last four weeks. its actually slightly worse than that but Im rounding to the nearest week. Its more like twice in the last month.Like you I have kids. We used to be great partners even with the sex issues but slowly the lack of sex led to lack of sleeping together led to skipping conversations led to the current situation where she can tell that things have really gone downhill.I dont know if well split or not but the lack of sex gradually poisoned my feelings for her in general along with her anger issues.,DeadBedrooms,cvvrba8,1,t5_2t25p

Within three months or so he lost his job and he stopped coming to bed with me...he spent day and night on the computer tying up the phone line with the modem to play on the MUDD. This should have tipped me off to how he viewed marriage. I was the one who looked for and found a new job for him. We moved and sometime in that first six months I suddenly became too fat for him.  ?!?!  He had trouble keeping it up and that was his explanation. Im sorry but once you get past a certain weight hes just not that interested anymore. I accepted that despite the fact that I hadnt outgrown any clothing. Things sporadically improved and eventually settled into a good xwk for about  years. There were stops and starts for kids and illness and whatnot.

Its simply a mismatch and the success is that both people find someone more in tune with their libido.OP having sex    times in a seven year long relationship is NOT normal. My beautiful fiancee and I have had sex more than  times in the past month and she works nights. Im not sure that I can offer you any real advice. If you get out of the relationship now at least your child will not know any different than the two of you not being together and co parenting. If you stay with this woman It sounds like you are in for lifetime of very little to no sex and a lack of that intimate connection. My success story is divorcing my ex and finding myself and my masculinity again.

5660020,1,t3_3smdab,I have considerable experience with therapists. Many of them are complete idiots. It is hard to find a good one  really hard. If you are serious about therapy then you should treat it like dating  keep trying new therapists until you find a good one  they are very rare. Sometimes a lousy therapist can give you a referral to a slightly better one they know and you can keep following the chain until you find someone who actually knows what they are talking about. Or maybe not its really just down to luck unfortunately.Now is your current therapist a female feminist by any chance? I ask this because  in my considerable experience  such therapists have no fricking clue of about the point of view of a male HL. Male LLs they can probably sympathize with because LL is more common in women so they would understand it better. But what you have to understand about therapists is that the vast majority of them bring their own biases into the session and feminist therapists can often only see the womans point of view. That leaves you up shit creek without a paddle and completely on your own. It sounds like you are there already. You now need to justify your actions not only to your wife but now to your therapist also and that is most likely going to crush your spirit.

I was denied intimacy with my own wife in my sexual prime except when it came to creating children that took about  tries in total. If you asked her at any point then or now shed tell you I was a model husband. Its worth reiterating What I wanted from her was the real thing. I didnt want her to feel forced. I wanted her to come to me because she really wanted me. So I faced the same dilemma that many spouses in here do? How do I tell her how important this is to me without making her give me pity sex or duty sex?And another thing Do you really think she didnt know it was an issue? When she turned me down on our wedding night she didnt realize that was a problem?

Yes it sucks but Im sure the baby wont spontaneously combust if hes awakened. I guess the natural way to end the sentence Youre right we should throw away our marriage because it might wake the baby!!! The worry doesnt equal the consequences.I also get the negative feedback loop. If she tries to initiate its a pity sex situation you hate it. If she tries to cuddle its just to meet her needs and its going to frustrate you more. Theres no chance for either of you to fix it. She doubles down on avoidance and you ratchet up withdrawals. I guess try the talk again but be a little more forthcoming. I dont want to be in a relationship where Im not wanted and Im not a priority.

Except that were fluid and therefore the very same move tomorrow may garner a different response than today. Ive tried in a very quiet nonhysterical way to get US to therapy for nearly  years. I went eventually he went and despite his apparent avoidance of the actual issues I was asking him to think about amp discuss in therapy finally theres maybe a we. I dont intend for the therapist to act as arbiter of righteousness of who wronged whom. I want to be heard.Now udbdbdb may be right in that none of this will work because Im not acting cool amp outcome independent and I seem to be saddling the man with the responsibility for desiring me when I should just be awesome and let him take it leave it hey plenty of fish in the sea right?The thing is thats all true. Of course I could stand to be more admirable and therefore magnetically desirable as I cultivate distance and my evolved awesome self. And of course I have hobbies. Must they be outside the home for them to qualify as such? I am mostly an introvert I dont actually prefer much socializing and Im very selective about the intimacy of friendship because it takes so much of my mental energy. This does not mean I am not a fully developed independent and self sufficient person. I want my husband but dont need him as he doesnt need me. But my observation of reality also suggests that my husband is the only father of my children. They need him. Theyre tiny and may quickly forget him if he stops coming around but this would mean they wont have a dad. If were not together theyll be getting less of his presence and therefore love. Hes not good with long distance affection. Well that shite wont fly not where my babies are concerned.And that if you think he of course wants to escape my haranguing if  conversations a year amp an unsuccessful lingerie show with manaborted fellatio constitute such  and no I do not nag in everyday life Mr. dbdbdb may be generously projecting his own story here wait till you see how he handles being held at an arms distance. Not well not constructively not in a way to advance our relationship anywhere better. .Do I think in a way my husband is holding the relationship hostage so its on his terms or else? Yes.

Sitting around all day and not observing your typical grooming or activity habits can often indicate depression.  Another symptom can be a lack of interest or a degraded interest in sex but it sounds as if your sex life was a bit troubled anyway in terms of notquiteperfect compatibility.The fact that you mentioned that he is less attracted to you now because you are more manly lookingwell he was honest about it and some people have certain tastes that they cant change.  But could part of his own mental challenge be that he feels some shame over being bisexual?  Could that also be a reason he doesnt want to bottom ever?  That bugaboo about the gay one really being the one who receives?  You may not have answers to these questions right now but perhaps if you want to keep giving this relationship a go couples counseling and individual counseling for him might be in order.  It might be a good place to bring these subjects up and lay everything out on the table.  Maybe an open relationship will work for the two of you but unless and until the relationship between the two of you is stable and honest and sustaining to you both I dont think its something you should try.,DeadBedrooms,cy0eie4,1,t5_2t25p

5963589,0,t1_cy1cnp0,I have asked her this for  years already and were nowhere better than we were before. She simply doesnt think that it is much of a problem and I dont want to offend her or pressure her aswell so Im just subtly hinting her. But there were times when I have clearly stated that it is one of my main problems but she forgets it after few weeks. I simply dont enjoy sex. She is very beautiful almost a perfect . But I just dont find the sex interesting anymore because I know how it will end  with her saying to stop because she got tired after  minutes and I can only use  sex poses. Everything else I tried she doesnt like and Im asking her for opinions all the time she just doesnt have any or anything new she wants to try.. I think the main problem is  she has never enjoyed orgasm so she doesnt know what the fuss is about that is why she doesnt really care that much about sex either. Her sex drive is lower than mine but its ok I think. But till she doesnt know how to please herself I dont know what else can I do..,DeadBedrooms,cy1cviv,0,t5_2t25p

The counselor would point out to him that he is using anger and refusal of cooperation as a means of control to avoid having to address your distress and anguish.  He would then accept this and start doing the heavy lifting of taking apart that structure the two of you built up to this point and creating another means of interaction.Dont count on it though. He is more likely to attack the counselor as full of it and stupid. People sometimes never see how they are mistreating the ones they love through anger and denial.

If its an inperson store only go to a femaleowned nonsleezy store like Smitten Kitten Good Vibes. If its a website you both use it. Both of those stores have websites.Before I continue let me tell you that some people are size queens and are really only happy with huge dicks. You seem to have completely lucked into finding a huge dick and you seem meh about it. If you dont appreciate it and you find it annoying you owe it to the other size queens to let him go and let him find somebody else who wants his monster dong. I would give the same advice to a man who married a women with enormous natural breasts and didnt really like breasts.Heres a truth about guys with huge dicks. Sometimes theyre shitty lovers because some women want them so much that they dont have to learn the other skills that make sex pleasurable for a woman. That goes the same for really pretty women sometimes theyre just lazy lovers.As for you and his dick. He doesnt need to go the doctor because nothing is wrong with his dick. Im sure he has no trouble masturbating. This is psychological he assumes hes not going to get laid and that youre going to get mad or cry. All of those things are happening and hes right.He knows sex is broken with you two and he doesnt know how to fix it and hes not yet ready to dump you over it. although if nothing changes soon he shouldAnd heres the part about why his sex toy purchase wasnt such a bad idea. His massive dick works best when youre already used to it. If you go weeks and months without your vagina stretched out you start from near zero and have to work up to it again. Trying to be really careful and work his dick in really slow especially if youre actually hurting and saying ouch stop ow is a total boner killer. He doesnt want to hurt you. If youre not using plenty of lube youre doing it wrong. His dick may be huge but his fist is bigger. If he has game he can insert a few fingers while simultaneously rubbing your clit. It takes skill and some guys are way better at it. If he wont go down on you he may also be crap at using his fingers.If you...dumdumdum... work on using the toy lots of lube with or without your guy you can work up to figuring out how to stretch yourself up to that size and maybe even figure out how to climax and have pleasure while something that big is in your vagina rather than just grimacing.If the toy is the same size as his dick and you can get to the point of easily playing with the toy youll be able to take him easily.If all of that sounds like too much work then please for the size queens out there end this soon.

So because I miss having that with him does it mean I still love him?  Or does the fact that I no longer want to make the effort mean Im not anymore or just tired from hurting?  I swear Im far less confused in other parts of my life its when this issue bubbles to the surface I dont even know what I really feel.I do know that he adamantly rejects any inference that were in a roommate situation or just friends and while he acknowledges that sex is lacking in our marriage he insists its the only thing lacking and its not as important as I make it out to be.  He says that when hes all leave or dont whatever you want that its because he cant deal with the conflict and if he cant give me what I need why fight to keep me here.  But whether thats lip service to cover real apathy I cant tell and that scares me.Because its not just him at this point  I havent always dealt with this well.  in the beginning I didnt understand the medical issues or how the whole ED thing worked.  I also had always attributed my former husbands constant need for sex to be because he was so into me I know now that as attracted as he was to me that his sex drive wasnt some tribute to me.  when you go into it with the mindset of erections  love and attraction then the lack of same can hit the ego pretty hard. Back then I had an issue with not wanting to do other stuff if he wasnt able to get hard because Id be so focused on why he didnt think I was pretty enough and no verbal assurances in the world helped when I was sure his lack of erection said everything that needed to be said about how he felt about me.  So he would only start when he thought he could finish and then if he couldnt Id cry because I felt rejected and hed feel like he let me down and be embarrassed...It was an ugly cycle at the beginning and no doubt I unintentionally did every thing on the list that would make ED worse.  When I learned more about the medical side of things and we tried to move past it with scheduling it so he could take a pill first doing other stuff if things waned...even when we were both making an honest effort I had a tough time with getting into it without spontaneity and lack of abandon?  I dont know how to phrase it but when youre both worried about things going south it was impossible for us anyway to lose yourself in the moment because always kind of waiting for things to come to an in opportune halt.  Then other stuff just felt like a favor to me so he didnt leave me frustrated.  Its really hard to finish when you feel like he isnt into it  it feels like he owes you one  no matter how nice he was about it.Tldr  long ramble about how Im as much to blame as him but now I have no idea if Im still in love with him or not.  But I am intrigued by the idea of conscious decoupling and am going to read up on that.,DeadBedrooms,czi83wd,1,t5_2t25p

We all want to believe we can have free conversation about sex with our partners but in reality judgement hurts.My wife and I are pretty close in body size and I think that her being heavier than me over the past few years has really hit at her selfconsciousdesire for me. She has lost some weight and I have gained a bit of muscle so it seems to be a good tradeoff.I think your first sentence really makes a great point there are two types of relationships that come to rDeadBedrooms one where both partners are willing to change because deep down they still love each other greatly and those that one or more partners has checked out.

So I aimed to resolve that stress by stepping up even MORE in my dad duties.  Cooking. More cleaning. More kid duties.  Yeah no... that wasnt it at all. How do I know? Because she got caught in an affair.     She just didnt have any desire for me. I get it now. I wouldnt either.  Ironically in hindsight I have no idea why I had any desire for her either. I really didnt have it for HER to be honest... just desire in general. I had needs like any other dude.   I got divorced and banged other women and found a LTR who is nuts for me. She works extremely long and stressful hours as an MD but looks to me as her oasis of awesome. I also look at her as an oasis away from my stress not a contributor to it.

And any other activities that might prolong the erection would likely push me over the edge. The solution for meongoing was to keep having sex with my wife until it didnt make me anxious anymore.

6567327,0,t1_czya5wm,Ok let me explain again. Instead of relationships lets use cars as an example.Say we want to know how peoples perception of their cars changes over time. So we get three groups of people group A just got their cars group B has had theirs for  years and group C has had theirs for  years.Now obviously there are a lot of factors that influence what people think of their cars. But were just trying to isolate one  how long theyve owned it.So how do we do that? We ask each group of people some questions about how much they like various aspects of owning their cars. Well use a  to  scale where  is very dissatisfied and  is very satisfied.Now in each of our three groups there will be some people who use a car to display wealth some who have a bunch of kids and need a lot of space in the car some who want a fuelefficient car and so on. Since were looking at averages though all these other factors average out.So say group A on the average rates their car .. Group B rates theirs . and group C rates theirs .. Now we need to do a statistical analysis to determine if this is enough of a difference that its unlikely to occur by chance. This is based on the number of people in the sample and  is a good sample size. The total population doesnt matter because were just looking at the statistical distribution of the numbers in the sample.If it turns out the result is significant then we can say that generally peoples positive feelings about their cars diminish over time but when they get a new car the feelings return.How do we know this if the study didnt look at subsequent cars? Because we took an average of people who got new cars  group A. Group A is intended to represent all people who just got a new car. Its just an average and its not going to be perfect obviously but by comparing the averages we can isolate the effect of duration.Were talking about relationships here of course not cars. For relationships Im using the ordinary English words boredom and variety to correspond to this pattern. Im not saying what the causes or motivations of this pattern are  in other words Im not saying WHY people get boredtired of someone over time and need variety. Maybe as the article suggests its because of hormonal changes that evolved to faciliate child rearing.But I think its fair to describe the phenomenon of interest declining over time as boredom. Thats what the word means.I agree about the study not being representative of older or longerterm relationships.gt People who describe their sex lives as such dont fit the model of those looking to change it up. gt women who have a problem with their desire waning and the probable causes would be an entirely different studyIm not sure I understand your point here.

While the kneejerk reaction would be What the hell? If you want to have sex why dont you have it with me then! I dont necessarily think its a bad thing.

6680934,0,t1_d0acssf,It is not a good sign when one partner is totally against therapy. If someone is interested in improving their marriage it takes a collaborative approach and both partners must be in agreement. Therapy is a slow process. Especially for people who do not possess the skills to make meaning through language together. You can sometimes get a reluctant spouse in the door in small steps first visit heshe sits in the car. Second visit heshe sits in the waiting room. Third visit heshe attends for a period of time. Fourth visit half the session and so on and so on until they are attending for a full session and participating comfortably. If your line in the sand is therapy then you need to communicate that to your spouse. Interview many different therapists until you both feel good about that practitioner and involve your spouse in the process. Giving him some control over the decision may make him less resistant to the idea. Good luck. ,DeadBedrooms,d0ad8i3,2,t5_2t25p

Ive heard about make up sex.   Sounds nice but then sex of any sort sounds pretty good.  . Occasional go to your room moments but I dont recall outright withdrawal of affection like youre describing.  That thing your MIL did was horrible.  Youre definitely on to something with this one to some degree.  It was manipulative and sends the message that love and support are contingent.  Not cool.  Since this is obviously how your SO was raised thats a pretty good connection youve drawn there.      Im super conscious about that kind of thing with my kids because my MIL and her were in a rough place when my SO was young....came from an outright abusive childhood as well.  Everyone has a back story.  But Ive already seen signs of my SO doing similar withdrawal so Im trying to keep my head in the game to either circumvent those moments or at least make sure I conclude any exchanges that have led to sternness or anger with affection.   That includes telling my kids I was wrong for losing my temper on the occasion that happens.  I want them to know that these two concepts are not mutually exclusive.   Your behavior actions were unacceptable and That doesnt make it OK for me to get so angry.  . Id be surprised if it were so monothemed but I can see it playing a huge role.

I was molested as a child and his fetish made me question whether I too was abusing my child!This doesnt strike you as something that needs to be addressed?  Arbitrary boundaries and accusations dont get much more serious than these.  gtThen he told me that I cant be a good mother if Im not a good wife. He thinks that part of being a good mom is making her partner happy so he wants to stick around to care for her offspring.I had a horrific dysfunctional childhood and he knows its so important that I be a good mom and he essentially told me I was a bad one. I was so upset and he he apologized tried to take it back. I asked if he wanted to leave? If he had cheated on me already? He said no but it felt really odd and uncomfortable. I really feel like it was a threat.  of men cheat when their wives are pregnant. My dad cheated on my mom when she was pregnant. My cousin was cheated on when she was pregnant too.This is waving enormous red flags for me.  This is not a trust issue Im not sure what it is.  Its not healthy for either OP or OPs partner though.  gtHe wasnt always so pushy about sex. Was he confessing to possibly cheating or just he firing a warning shot over the bow? Should I take steps to protect my family by insisting he get a vasectomy in case he strays?  Rationalization and projection I guess?  The anxiety is clear but the solution seems unhinged.

Until you lash out at some point feeling rightious and fully justified. That she brought this on and knows how you feel.Super unhealthy. Escalation is also a thing the more you stew.A shrink can teach you to better roll with the situation. To catch that hatred early and channel in t away from escalating frustration and rage. To feel the emotion no be it. And then to make decisions that assist in calming back down to a normal state.In short sex doesnt have to ruin your day.

Depends a LOT on how you define wanting to have sex.  If you generally enjoy it and get aroused and climax when you do have sex but just dont think about it much otherwise maybe youve just got a responsive desire. Google the term for much more in depth description.  If thats the case though it should be a relatively simple matter to just do it more often.  Of course that comes after sorting through all the layers of other crap. It should also be after you come to an understanding that starting and then calling things off if its just not happening for you is OK. A lot of LL women are afraid to try to get going by starting because they feel that they cant stop once they start.

One assumption youve made is that the divorce of ones parents is more painful to than ones parents staying together in a marriage that isnt working. Im not saying which is better because I could never know each person is different and what would have been better can never be known because people dont get to live the flip side of a coin. As a child of divorce I am glad they didnt stay together i feel if they had my childhood would have been worse off. Others stay together for the kids and get divorced as soon as the kids leave home because that will save the kids pain. Except for my partners brother who was  when his parents divorced and has not handled it well at all and now refuses a relationship with either my partner who was  now has a better relationship with both now that theyre no longer playing her off against the other in their competition with each other.What i am saying is if your only reason for staying with someone is having kids thats still just an excuse. You can sit there and pretend you know what impact it would have on your kids and which would be better for them but you dont know.

In the current study these regions were activated during viewing of sexually explicit materials across the groups with and without CSB. The observation of stronger activations of these regions in CSB versus healthy volunteer participants is similar to findings observed for substance cues in substance addictions suggesting neurobiological similarities across the disorders.The Cambridge study comes to the conclusion that for people with compulsive sexual behavior porn is affects your brain like a drug.  AlsoCSB subjects also had greater impairments of sexual arousal and erectile difficulties in intimate relationships but not with sexually explicit materials highlighting that the enhanced desire scores were specific to the explicit cues and not generalized heightened sexual desire.Translation  porn use affects your sex life.

7546900,0,t1_d2zu1dx,gt If I can speak for other LLs... We feel we should want it too. We dont understand why we dont.Id like to share my libido theory with you perhaps you can give me some feedback.I think there are two aspects to libido  the physical and the mental. The physical is just the craving for sexual contact or being horny. This results due to hormone levels in the body...in particular elevated hormones. Its one of the reasons why people feel strong sexual desire at the beginning of the relationship because everything is new and exciting and this leads to elevated hormone levels. Its also why people tend to feel strong sexual desire in extreme situations  like after a fight or in public. The mental is simply what sex means to the individual. The role and importance that it plays in their life and the personal and emotional benefits they get from having it. I compare it to going to the gym  I dont particularly like lifting heavy weights over my head but I love what doing it does for my life  I like feeling healthy having more energy having more muscles and a leaner frame. In terms of sex I want it not because Im horny or because my body is urging me to but rather I love how having sex makes me feel emotionally  loved and desired. If youre reading the threads from HLs here you see this in action where the lack of sex makes them feel undesirable and unloved and unattractive.When it comes to pure physical libido I think this is a difficult thing to keep up longterm. Research has shown that pure physical libido dies off in LTRs as the couple gets used to each other and hormone levels drop off. Plus there are a number of things that can get in the way  stress birth control or depression medication health problems that persons physiology etc. However if a person has mental desire they can still crave sex.The individuals libido is then a combination of both but I think rather than HL and LL we can divide people up into active and passive libido groups. Active libido people are able to create their own desire because they want sex for reasons beyond physical urges. Passive libido people have no interest in sex nor does it give them any emotional rewards so their desire is based solely on their physical state. This is where the in the mood idea comes from. When approached for sex they will not be interested unless theyre in the mood for it or their bodies are physically craving sex. They dont think to actively create desire because sex has no greater meaning to them.Im a guy in my midthirties and my physical sex drive has definitely dropped off since my early twenties. However I identify as firmly HL and I believe its coming from my mentalemotional craving for sex.  of the sex I have happens at night after work  honestly physically speaking Im not particularly horny and would probably be content to crash on the couch and watch TV. Even when Im with the woman up to the point where we start getting physical with each other I may not particularly be horny. I move forward with my plans to have sex because I want to  purely from a mental standpoint. Once we start getting physical my body responds and I get horny but its not like my physical desire for sex is what motivated me. In that regard I think Im creating my desire and I feel like this is the attribute that LLs lack. With a different mindset I could possibly be LL.So when you say you forced yourself to have sex...forced is definitely the key word there. You may be agreeing to have sex but mentally youre not there. You might be wishing you were but that also is not sexy. As any guy with nerves will confirm if youre trying to get intimate with a woman but having erection problems thinking Oh man why isnt it getting hard! I should be! Why!? pretty much guarantees youre not going to have an erection. Theres nothing arousing about that. I got the passive libido vibe from your post. Like you are chasing that elusive horny feeling and at a loss as to why you dont feel it more often. I think that horny is something you can create but you have to want to do that. Im sitting here typing this reply and dont particularly feel horny or anything close to it but if someone offered me sex Id say yes without hesitation. I want sex for reasons beyond physical desire and once I got started my body would respond and Id be horny and enjoy all the physical sensations that came with it. So its all in the mind. But its difficult for me to speculate how the LLs are approaching it since I am decidedly not LL...this is just my theory based on my own situation and having read countless stories here plus experiences out in the dating field so to speak.,DeadBedrooms,d301nws,11,t5_2t25p

This is a hard limit deal breaker item in your relationship. If she doesnt see that as a problem then youve been dumped.

Weve always been of the mindset that counseling is for others and not for us. Ive been more and more open to the idea because I feel it may be the only way to salvage our relationship. I fear my partner will find it laughable.Then find a new partner because this is essentially laughing at something you feel is important.

7842600,0,t1_d3xje9e,gt All I mean by that is that Im rarely really in the mood to have sex.Ive gone off on this before but I hate absolutely loathe the concept of being in the mood for sex. What does that even mean?Im a guy in my midthirties. I work a job in an industry known for stressful long hours. I have a dead bedroom at home so I have affairs to get my sexual needs met. As a result pretty much  of my sex is scheduled. Its scheduled for a small window after work and before I go home. And you know...Im not a spry something anymore.  of the time heading into these encounters I could honestly probably just crash on the couch and chill out until bedtime. I head into these sexual encounters for no other reason than I want to. I enjoy sex and want to have it. Its not that Im in the mood for it Im not carrying a raging erection to the date. I just want to have sex. We meet up start to go through the motions and in the process my body gets on board and I get horny and really start enjoying the physical aspect of it. And sometimes my body doesnt really get into it. And thats fine. Sex is about way more to me than just getting off. I dont identify in any way as an LL so its difficult for me to understand the mindset. But I feel like without that strong mental urge to have sex I could easily be LL. The days of me being randomly horny and all hopped up on sexual energy are long behind me. My sexuality is now coming from a mental place.So if youve come here looking for opinions this is mine. Dont be passive about your own sexuality. Its something you can actively control. If you want to improve your sex life you will have to be more active about the process not just give in to Im not in the mood. I said we HLs dont want duty sex and yes that is very much true. But there is a huge difference between My body isnt into it but I want to be here and part of this process and My body isnt into it...but Ill do it anyway because I know my partner wants it though Id rather be doing something else. You know at one point my wife agreed to have sex everyday. And yknow I thought maybe just maybe my DB issues were solved! But a week and a half in it became painfully apparent that she was just allowing it. She was wholly indifferent to it. And that didnt work out. You know what would have worked though? Three times a week...three times a week we have sex that shes actually there and present for. Hell it doesnt even have to be PIV just some form of intimate touching and contact. Three times a week! Maybe  minutes per encounter. Give me that and Im not out there having affairs.And again if you really dont want to do that just tell your husband  look this is the way it is. Ive made my choice about my sexuality and I know that doesnt work for you so you have my blessing as it were to go out and get your needs met elsewhere. This is what I can do for you  you continuing to expect me to have sex when Im telling you I dont is unfair to the both of us. Then it will be up to him to decide whether or not he can accept that.And thats it really. Either you want to improve your sex life and make the effort to do so or you dont and give him the resources to find his own satisfaction. Thats the bottom line.,DeadBedrooms,d3xkrlu,9,t5_2t25p

She said that was  of who she is. She also told me that she is interested in BDSM masterslave dynamics but not with me.   So its hard to say.

7950463,0,t1_d49o2f2,Youre right. Its wrong to make assumptions. Ive tried as you can imagine its just over time its making me numb too in the process. The idea of using porn. Im dealing with someone whos obviously built differently but I cant help but feel he has changed too much maybe to his own detriment. Im not saying that because of rejection but his viewpoint on life seems to be becoming more of some kind of singularity. I learnt to never compare myself to porn. Im just wondering where from here to go on. He seems to be a genuinely kind person but mix up the bedroom fanatics and the lines blur. As you said earlier were fundamentally not compatible. If that is the case. I still wonder about compromise. As you said love and commitment doesnt always translate into sex. To most what Im suggesting sounds like subjecting myself to a Sahara desert. Then I must find fulfilment elsewhere. I do wonder though if people like this do not want sex with with their partners then what would they think about the idea of open relationships or cheating? Regardless of the why the reality is that he doesnt want to have sex with youIn theory this therefore should not surprise them not bother them. Not physically of course. Im not looking into avenues like that as its not my thing. Obviously dating young and tying someone down and male like that may be the thing taking the lustre out of wanting sex in a relationship. Porn will take precedence as a replacement for lacking a bachelor life. That and or a possible porn addiction. Maybe its the curse of being in a relationship so young and for so long without any direction which will lead...to one click away. Making the assumption of an eventual progression into something more such as marriage or monogamy with no clear boundaries to begin with is what creates this mess.,DeadBedrooms,d49ph5i,1,t5_2t25p

Undecyclenateundecanoate esters are too long and dont make it easy to keep blood levels constant. This becomes an issue sometimes with trt because a doctor may only want to do injections every  weeks but you may only feel the benefits for  days. Better off with weekly or even biweekly injections keeping the same overall dose to keep levels constant.The patch and gel options can be viable and theyre usually a doctors first choice but theyre less bioavailable and you then need to worry about the gel rubbing off especially onto other people like women or children they certainly dont need extra test.Oral options can be considered as well but all oral AAS are at least slightly hepatotoxic.

I still initiate when I think she might be responsive but i dont feel as much pressure when I do and neither does she. I also made it clear that I would rather get her off than anything else and all she has to do is give me some signal or tell me.

8145576,0,t3_4qtfqp,Im sorry youre going through all this. Im not saying you are to blame for anything. However one thing we learn is that all we can control is ourselves. So if you look for anything in yourself that is causing this problem and still come up empty then you know its something you cant control and with that information you can decide whether to accept it or leave. So is it possible theres something on your end that can be improved? Im not just talking about sexual technique but anything within the relationship? Maybe she wishes you would take charge of the household more but feels she cant trust you for some reason whether thats your fault or stemming from some other issue on her part. Maybe youve changed physically since marriage or she has. A little context there will help us give you more specific advice. Yes you guys are young but a happy relationship is not impossible and its not automatic that problems are only because of your youth.,DeadBedrooms,d4vqrul,2,t5_2t25p

8171771,1,t3_4r7aqp,Listen here fellers...Im going to let you in on a female secret.  Women want to have sex. When they are attracted to you they cant keep their hands off you.  I have a circle of about  female friends.  When we get together for girl time...all they do is talk about how hot and sexy certain men are.  Its never their husbands.   If you sent fresh dong their way they would go crazy for it.  Their minds are just as horny as ever but they are bored of having sex with their spouses. These are women who are in all stages of life  kids no kids  yrs married  yrs dating...on birth control..not on birth control...working not working etc.   Men would probably be shocked at the dirty talk and level of sexual aggression these women exhibit.If you are just three years into this romance and its already dead you are doomed.  Its obvious you still have the hots for her but shes just not clicking for you.   So you can either hope that she suddenly gets turned on by you again or you can move along to the next dating partner.   I dont know why dead bedroom partners always try to blame it on some external thing instead of just accepting that many romances just have a shelf life and ends when the chemistry has been extinguished? ,DeadBedrooms,d4z0rl5,0,t5_2t25p

He stated that he felt like we were just best friends and a lot of other things that still sting. But once he came back he said hes just been really down and felt like we hadnt made any progression with my anxiety issues. We talked more for the next few days and decided to work on ourselves and each other. Everything has been better besides the sex. Even well before that sex was infrequent. We go to the gym working on eating healthier we treat each other better. Arguments are resolved a lot cleaner. And thats terrifying. Everything else has fallen into place he has a great new job we function better as a couple he brags about having me all the time to his friends and says how lucky he is.

8180818,0,t1_d501ab1,You assume too much. If you ever read my posts or comments I know you do obvious you have some sort of vendetta against me I said I came out of bedridden state about  years ago. Now going on  years. It was only  years ago that my marriage became an open marriage. In that three years before open marriage I made many changes for myself. I did let go of the things I couldnt control so I concentrated on me. Couldnt control him so I controlled me. Getting my hair done a new color shopping starting a company and becoming involved in various organizations. I did all this before open marriage. And it did make a difference. I felt appreciated needed and satisfied I was making a difference in the world. Helping others became a huge reward. It didnt solve my DB but I was getting stronger more confident boosting self esteem and finally an independent person who did what I wanted to do. I also found happiness by not being completely dependent on my husband to provide my happiness. Again this is before open marriage. I went out more. I didnt have friends before but I made some great ones. It became fun. A lot of fun. Laughter is great medicine. It heals the soul. We have girls night or getting together to work out. Go on vacations together.  Socialized and networked. I started to enjoy my life despite DB. This is what everyone can do to start feeling better about themselves than being at home alone. I chose to go out and have a life. I also dont think I would have had the courage or be in the right mindset for open marriage if I did not go through self improvement for  years. Yes I am in an open marriage but frankly for the last few months I havent seen my AP more than  times.  times in few month would be considered DB in here. I do not derive my happiness with sex alone. I am too busy with my life family company organizations and travel to really miss AP. I wanted an option to be with a man should I choose to but I dont exercise that option often. I did for a time being.  I had my share of men but that novelty wore off. Now I rather build my company and make more money. My AP will always come LAST in my priority list. Sex is not do or die for me. It is important but not as others for me at least.Perhaps when you imagine open marriage its banging someone often. I am sure there are people doing that. But I limit mine to just month. If that. My family comes first. You are bitter jaded angry resentful and full of negativity. Not everyone is you. Yes I did say dont listen to Internet strangers who are telling the posters to leave. There have been several posts recently even today why is the answer just leave? I did not tell him to leave divorce or whatever. Its his decision if he wants to leave or not. I let the poster decide. Its not my life. I just commented on how I dealt with my DB.If you would like I will quality all my comments with I am in an open marriage if you qualify all your comments as if you dont divorce then youre a fool and your kids will be fucked up. That is your go to answer isnt it?  Your comment history is set on repeat. You rarely answer to the poster but give out your go to generic answer.Curious. Did you leave DB? Did you fight in front of your children? WereAre they aware of your marital issues? Is your home environment hostile full of anger? You are one of the most judgemental people here. ,DeadBedrooms,d505h8p,0,t5_2t25p

A quick review of his posts seems to indicate that has zero interest in even understanding her emotional state and the letter her confirms it.  Everything is her fault hes the one the wants to communicate his feelings are very important.  He is perhaps resolving the problems that he things should exist but probably dont.  He asserted rather confidently that the problem was the SSRIs.  Of course this is absurd she was texting another guy for who knows how long.  A better explanation is that she is depressed about the state of marriage and seeking emotional intimacy elsewhere.  So a thoughtful question would be Why is my wife seeking emotional intimacy from someone else? In short he needs counseling and fast.  Everyone has narcissistic traits.  We all cast ourselves as the protagonist in the movie of our own lives and persuade ourselves that we are the hero and everyone else is the villain.  In marriage being empathic means doing something very hard and unnatural  you need to reverse the roles let the other person be the hero and see yourself as the villain.  Then maybe you can start to understand what is going on.  The goal is not to fall on your sword but to enter into someone elses space and understand.

If I had it to do over again Id definitely either not marry or would marry a woman  or so years younger than me.Im a data driven person and when this started to happen in my marriage  scoured the internet for information about it and one conclusion I came to  menopause is such a sensitive topic to women and such a closely guarded secret that you wont find much reliable information on it.  Most details are obfuscated hidden etc.  But some important things  the effects of menopause vary among women but not nearly as much as is portrayed and generally speaking once menopause hits sex drive diminishes to near nothing and for the majority of women penetrative sex becomes painful.  Hormone replacement therapy can cure most of the effects but these days most women dont take it due to a cancer scare.  For much of the th century HRT was common which is the origin of most of the myths which are completely untrue that some women actually experience an increase in sex drive after menopause.  But I can tell you from experience that even while a mans hormones begin to trickle away in midlife its nothing like the immediate stoppage that happens in women.  Im just as horny as I was in my s and am forced to live as a celibate for the rest of my life.But its not just the sex.  A big part that sucks is that the man is also typically blamed for it even though he has absolutely no control of whats going on.  Women will also lose much of their bonding instinct with their mate at this time too and even things like hugs and kisses fall by the wayside.But yeah your parents are being more honest with you than most of the people on this thread.,DeadBedrooms,d5jatpn,1,t5_2t25p

The sub has a lot of posts about   year long bouts of forced celibacy coupled with misery but they stay because ... The because doesnt really matter after decades of abject misery. Empathy doesnt really matter any longer when the OP is a depressed husk of a former self.Sometimes you just need a shock to the system to see things clearly. Many times there are lies upon delusions that the OPs create but cant see through. My spouse is great and I love my spouse then describe a person that the spouse used to be but is no longer or describe a person the spouse should be but isnt.Other times the thought of leaving never occurred or was clouded by other reasons cant vs. prefer not to.As for the HL vs. LL it again depends on the circumstance. Plenty of HLs get blasted on here too. Plenty of LLs are lauded for efforts. The imbalance may be due to the simple issue the one who desires the least in a sexual relationship usually controls the amount of sex in a relationship. An unfortunate side effect of such power is contempt by the other partner.

8466438,0,t1_d5zte0w,Your SO is a non biological parent which means he has zero legal custodial or visitation rights. If you leave your son in the custody of a non legal parent or guardian your ex husband can now allege you are in violation of the custodial agreement. This is where you your attorney would need to appeal to the judge to establish visitation orders for your SO. This is an uphill bullshit battle which doesnt usually end well for non legal parents. You have to prove your SO is more of a father than your ex spouse which is expensive and hard to dispute over established paternity. Your ex spouse will crybaby that your sons time spent with your boyfriend is less time spent with a legal parent himself and the judge will likely agree. So legally the only way you can have your SO spend time with your son is while your son is with you during the time you legally get to have him. Your ex spouse can object but the child is in your custody so your ex spouse can go cry in a hat. Its only when something unlawful occurs which jeopardizes your sons welfare in your custody that your ex husband will have cause. The court doesnt care about your story. It cares about the law. Demonstrate where the law is being violated any law your welfare your sons welfare custodial financial obligations terms of the custody agreement and the court will take interest. If you cant then its time to think outside the box.Start working on a proposal that will appeal to your ex husband and make sure he signs it. Then get it to the court as quickly as possible.

So that you truly believed he wasnt attracted to you and you acted accordingly. Creating a self fulfilling phrophecy.  The projection coming from a deep unconscious belief that you felt unattractive in yourself  that it was you who was shutting down the sexuality between you both.  Not being at a place where you could deal with the associated insecurities you instead project that shame  guilt onto him as a generalised feeling that he wasnt attracted to you.    As you dealt with those insecurities directly within yourself went to the gym  got fitter belived in your own selfworth and allowed yourself to feel fundamentaly sexy the need to project your insecurities onto him greatly reduced over time.  This allowing you to perceive your partner in a much less distorted way. This allowed you to better respond to his needs instead of you reacting to your own insecurities. Leading to stronger feelings of attraction between you both.  He in turn probably hadhas issues that lessened in response to you dealing directly with yours. His may still be around.

It happens in other practice areas so Id imagine its even more true with your line of work.Can you nail down an act that produces this result? I ask because I wonder if you can then identify things close to that act that start to trigger you. Is it a small a touch dirty talk or ?  For example you were to parade around naked while your H watched would you be triggered when he completed? I ask because I wonder if its self shame parading around naked would presumable trigger or shame triggered by the sightsmell of his orgasm having him do that without sex would give you context? Or something else? I ask because I recall your not having these episodes by yourself.I get unclean vs. anxiety but what if its some form of defensiveness? Is your heart not racing after sex? Im not snarking I mean that you may be misinterpreting your racing heart as physical activity vs. stress or you may be triggering by the racing heart and misidentifying it as shame?If the unclean feeling is that of being used is it the submissiveness and vulnerability of sex?

8702131,0,t1_d6sxstb,That is one way to look at it. I think if sex was purely a physical act masturbating to porn would be no big deal. But it is more than physical. It fills additional needs. The reason it feels bad when your wife doesnt want sex any more or doesnt initiate sex or seems bored during sex ......is the same reason your wife feels bad when you have sex with porn or Rosie. It is the same feeling. That feeling has the same root cause. It is the same reason you cant say it wasnt cheating when I slept with that other girl because I thought of you the whole time.People do form attachments with paper. They fill needs and desires that detract from their RL relationship sometimes without even recognizing that theyre doing it. Guys who are challenged to not fap are surprised that they cant last long. They laugh it off and call it inevitable. Very few pause to examine which need dragged them back to that cam girl. Acceptance? Success? Exploration? Beauty? Order? Freedom? It is lazy and unhealthy and irresponsible to fill your needs with porn or donuts or meth or alcohol without even noticing what needs you are having. That is how addictions are born and how addictions persevere. I am demisexual so it is extra important to me. Some people dont care. Some people enjoy doing it together or rely on it for mismatched drives or turn to porn or affairs when sex in their marriage is flatly ignoredeven while they would prefer invested sex initiated by their lover. Thats fine. However saying that porn doesnt impact sex or that porn has nothing to do with your partner or that it is unfair for your partner to have negative feelings about your porn use .....is naive. ,DeadBedrooms,d6tedqd,3,t5_2t25p

8887716,0,t1_d7fbq1z,Yes the poster below is correct that IS what I am asking for help with. Im sorry to be honest. I love the man he used to be and became again and thats why I continued to fight for so long. But withdrawing from our relationship and turning for . years into an anxiety zombie who self soothed with pornography daily was not a healthy adult behavior. I am not being invalidating because there is nothing to validate. I KNOW my words and thoughts would be emasculating which is why I dont give them voice but that does not make them less true.  I tried very hard that whole time to be loving and help him relax and offer myself emotionally and sexually but he could not open up. I experienced the entire grieving process of someone who has ended an amazing relationship with someone they loved dearly. It was the most painful experience of my life. And just when I was about to walk out the door literally  the clouds parted and he woke up.  I understand how it can happen but it is very hard to forget the anxiety zombie and see the man again when he reemerges. He was a completely different person and he freely admits that. Its taking a long time for me to be able to desire him as a man and not just a platonic love. Its been  months and I am only just starting to see flickers of it now. I know that we are supposed to be understanding of people with mental illness and I am understanding. But my vagina is having a hard time getting on board with that. Its not fair to him so I dont let him know this is how it is for me. Of course knowing that I can see him that way would hurt him and ruin his building self confidence and confidence in us. Sometimes I feel like people with mental illness expect a lot of those without it who love them and sometimes I perhaps wrongly feel that its an unfair sense of entitlement. Alcoholism is a disease but no one says youre not responsible when you crash a car. Anxiety is too and it was beyond his control and was responsible for tearing up a once close and beautiful relationship. The person I loved turned into someone unloving and therefore unloveable. And now the guy I love came back again. Its hard to forget his evil twin. And his evil twin was not in any way sexually attractive. ,DeadBedrooms,d7g6eus,5,t5_2t25p

8983614,0,t3_53bw56,gtis it possible for her to develop more of a sex drive if she wants to?Yes absolutely. But you definitely need to stop focusing on orgasm so much. If she wants a healthy sex drive she should want sex for reasons beyond physical pleasure. Thats why you want sex isnt it? If you just wanted to get off you could masturbate for that. Im betting that your desire for sex is linked to what sex means to you and the role it plays in your relationship. It has a greater meaning and thats what you want. Your wife lacks that attachment to sex so she only wants sex when her body prompts her to. Which is as youve seen not all that often.The difference is being able to create your own desire.Its great that shes willing to do what she can for the sake of the relationship. Wonderful actually. Instead of being disappointed that shes not into it work on encouraging her for at least being willing showing gratitude and pleasure for that effort. Think about it from her POV  she agrees to do this thing that she doesnt really want to do and gives her no physical pleasure. Shes doing it for your sake. Despite that youre not happy because shes not doing it the way you want her to and not having the desired physical response that she doesnt really have any control over. This is not exactly an appealing process for her.Keep having regular sex. But your mission its a shared mission with her is to make each encounter as fun as possible. Forget about orgasm for now. Just work on pleasing her in other ways. Dont make orgasm the goal of sex. Explore other ways to enjoy sex  look into the mentalemotional side. Can she appreciate feeling sexy and desired? Maybe shed enjoy feeling submissive or dominant? Role play... I mean theres a lot more to sex than just physical pleasure and reducing it to that does it a great disservice.The end goal is for her to want sex for herself. You have the motivation for her to at least start going down that path the health of the marriage and she seems at least willing to try. All you need to do is continue to be open and receptive and be more aware of the paths you need to take.,DeadBedrooms,d7roxx8,16,t5_2t25p

9033641,0,t1_d7xo4n1,I personally dont suggest taking drugs. Youre trying to lose weight permanently and unless you plan to take drugs your entire life dont even bother. Birth control can promote weight gain but a much bigger factor is happiness. Make sure he wants sex because he loves and desires you not as a pressure relief. You definitely have to try talking to him about it otherwise if youre not  comfortable with him you HAVE TO leave ESPECIALLY for your children. Dont let them grow up thinking its ok to be depressed in a relationship or that you have to destroy yourself for the sake of kids or a partnership. Relationships are NOT lack of freedom. Youre free to walk away at any time if YOU are not happy anymore and there are no solutions to the problems. Some people simply clash and have differing ideas bout life sex and love. As for showering set up a schedule. Shower or bathe at least every  days. Take it slow at first really scrub yourself but not violently. Do it gently massage your skin. Use soaps and products that smell good to you. Look after your body and pamper it. Once youre all dry enjoy the fluffy feeling of your hair the smoothness of your skin the lack of itching cause theres no grease plastered on your pores. It can be tough but it can only take  minutes to get clean and the aftermath is incredibly rewarding. Love yourself!! Loving yourself and respecting your body is sexy! Would you want to have sex with your partner if he wouldnt care about his hygiene health and comfort? Would you feel comfortable with someone who puts no effort into himself or into trying to be attractive to you? Taking care of yourself DESPITE what he makes you feel means selfrespect. Your worth is NOT defined by your partner. If your partner doesnt provide you with the knowledge youre beautiful then do it yourself  until your partner is able to see it as well and agree with you or until youre confident enough to get up and leave cause you deserve better. You deserve HAPPINESS! You CAN NOT have a healthy relationship if one of the partners is unhappy or feeling bad. Look at yourself and see yourself. Sure there may be some extra pounds on you but you ARE capable of losing them. It just takes time. Until then keep your skin clean and clean your thoughts. Clean your mind from the dirt you have insecurities and hopelessness. It doesnt help you so throw it out! and embrace life. BREATHE AGAIN. Because all that pressure of dirt can really suffocate you. For depression I personally suggest better eating avoid ALL processed foods. If it is not in a recognizable shape as in in the form you would get it from nature dont eat it. and getting out more. Exercising can be hard when youre depressed unmotivated and overweight I would know so take it easy first and walk around the house or apartment complex wherever you leave. Focus on nature and your surroundings. Leave the bad feelings behind and take the world in how it is. Hopefully you can take some of that fresh air back into your home to dust off all the collected isues and youll have the energy to tackle them again. You owe it to yourself and your children to love and respect yourself. Its easier said than done truly but it really isnt that complicated either. Just stop putting focus on the bad things stop brooding and marinating in the negativity step out and fill your lungs both physically and mentally with an energizing amount of oxygen. Life is beautiful! If your partner cant help you see it leave! and prove to your children that happiness and love is possible outside of a relationship! Relationships are NOT cages they should NOT suffocate. They should NOT be problem solvers. Relationships are merely an addition to what should be an otherwise happy and fulfilling life.,DeadBedrooms,d7xp8cz,1,t5_2t25p

Even couples who are just dating seem to have some kind of system that determines who will plan the evening.  Like when my bffs girlfriend comes over she just assumes that my friend is going to feed her cook order take her out whatever and when they go over to her place my friend assumes that the gf has planned for food and all their other activities for that matter.  People complain about the deciding on whats for dinner thing a lot but its not something I see very much in real life.

9155361,0,t1_d8cgu69,Well to be honest Im not sure but I do know that my reliance and quite frankly obsession with porn and masturbation has created an unattainable and unrealistic desire standard that artificially inflates my libido. So growing out of porn and excessive maturation is bringing me back to a natural baseline state that will allow for a more honest conversation about both of us meeting our needs with each other. Otherwise my false perspective is I need you to be a full time bimbo slut who takes it in all holes anytime I want and drinks my loads like theyre the last water on earth. I want to be selfish and greedy and not care about your needs or desires as you are just what I see on a screen with my pants around my ankles. Thats neither honest realistic or fair. Not to her and not to myself as I know from having weeks and months free from my oppressive porn mindset that I actually love her and am very much attracted to her. And while the fantasy of some slutty bimbo is appealing to my base desires that is not the type of person I feel I can remain attracted to in higher levels of intimacy and affection. Not to disparage slutty bimbos Im sure theyre great people but aside from visually appealing we dont otherwise have much in common. As I get more clearheaded Im into rpornfree and cautiously okay with rnofap Im having more interest in discussing our sexual disfunction with healthy honest and fair conversations. Im not demonizing porn or blaming it for my problems. Its me and my addictive nature that took a common distraction and made it an overly significant and powerful detraction from an otherwise healthy life. ,DeadBedrooms,d8ciays,6,t5_2t25p

It can be beneficial as it gives you time to build anticipation and get in the mood beforehand and helps ensure that you maintain an good frequency whatever that is for the two of you.

If both partners are on the same page brutally honest with themselves and each other and theres an unambiguous and high level of confidence that the sexual compatibility is there for the long term then marriage and kids should no longer carry the punch they otherwise might.   There are unknown unknowns of course but the commitment to keep sexual intimacy alive...and with a fair amount of specificity...should provide an anchor of sorts that it remains a priority for both parties.  ,DeadBedrooms,d8dmtdv,2,t5_2t25p

Yeah well these things have a way of forming a selfsustaining pattern.  Where are you now? Hes unhappy he pulls away youre unhappy so you nag him and he gets unhappier.  Lather rinse repeat.  The only thing in a multiperson pattern you can change is yourself. Now Im not asking this next part to crap on you but to get you to examine honestly what else is going on in your relationship?  A guy certainly might be inclined to check out if he perceives a pattern of nagging and guilt tripping. Not just in the bedroom but in daily life in judgment of his career of his financial choices in whatever.gt  Is it selfish of me to want to have my needs fulfilled so that I can focus on being a good partner to my fiance. Maybe Im reading too much into the language you used but it almost sounds like your affection and desire to be a good partner is... conditional.  Maybe you being a good partner comes right alongside with or perhaps even before the amping up of his desire. Not after. Right now it sounds kinda like that old officeplace joke The beatings will continue until morale improves.So my direct advice would be to spend some time making sure that you are being a great partner in the sense of being low pressure low maintenance low drama and not using guilt or pressure. Give him the chance to feel needed and support his decisions. Try to introduce sex by being light and flirty rather than heavy and demanding.

He needs to treat you with love if he expects you to do the same.gthe expects me to have sex when I am unwell and tired?

Then rinse and repeat the next day. And again. And again. I felt I loved him so much. Whenever he treated me nicely it got my heart racing. FINALLY he saw what he had in me. FINALLY he accepts me. FINALLY he truly loves me until he yet again treated me like shit. And I blamed myself. Who else could have caused this? He loves me....! So he must hate me right now because I did something wrong. Maybe if I dont aggravate him he will be comfortable with me. Maybe then I will feel his love again. Maybe then we can stop arguing. It never came. And guess what at the very beginning he was the most charming caring and accepting guy. It all happened so swiftly and smoothly I didnt realize what was going on. I was crying daily. i was miserable. And people kept calling me out on it telling me he treats me bad. That theyre worried. Did I listen? No. Because I knew he loves me. I knew I love him. But dependency is not love. Its sick. Its damaging. Its destructive. All it does is feed the sick ego of a sick person the abuser. SAVE YOUR CHILD AND YOURSELF. Its so much better trust me!! I am now happily married with a man who has never raised his hand against me. Who has sex with me because he loves me not because I do something. Who kisses me and hugs me every day.

Our emotional intimacy is fantastic we share our fears and hopes openly we support one another we have lots of platonic touch we enjoy spending time together in the house or outside it. Im making a point of getting back into old hobbies keeping up an exercise regime that gets me out of the house making social plans and supporting him to do the same.

9524053,0,t3_5aod6x,I just came across your post today so I apologize for the late response.  I am a woman in my s with fibromyalgia so I feel that I can somewhat relate to this situation so let me lay it out for those that dont get it  chronic constant pain narcotic meds that dont really work but you get all the side effects sleepy brain fog constipation etc married work full time to survive come home amp help hold down the house while still in constant pain which is exhausting.  Imagine the pain from being in a car accident  for years. Literally. Its exhausting.But to continue a large amount of my energy goes to dealing with pain so I need to ration the rest which means setting priorities.  Ive done this with my husband and we determined we cant pay for my meds without me working do theres a huge chunk and by the end of the day there nothing left for sex.  If theres a way for your wife to build up her energy reserves so to speak it will help her deal with the pain better and she may do a little better during sex.However end story here is you will probably always feel bad.  Im pretty sure my husband does too and he stopped asking a few years ago.  I have started initiating because thanks to a med change I have a small libido but due to pain I am very limited to what I can do positionally.  I also think your wife needs to put in some effort to NOT make you feel bad!!  If she gets involved a little bit it will show that shes at least interested in you even if she cant do what she used to.  If shes not willing to do that then I think you have  options  have a conversation about going elsewhere or stop having a heart and caring about how your wife feels please dont do this.  Im being sarcastic.  I think a chat about more effort or a nd partner is needed.Thank you for sticking this out with your wife.  I had no idea that in my late s Id have such a life altering medical condition and almost  years later I still feel like a failure of a wife because I had to change my career which meant a huge money loss more days at work I used to work three  hour shifts I cant keep a clean house like I used to I cant be a proper wife... my husband is incredibly supportive amp never once said a negative thing but he doesnt need to I feel bad enough on my own amp I know your wife does too.,DeadBedrooms,d9n1hv6,1,t5_2t25p

9553672,0,t1_d9qo6ac,Nope.  For some people when they have a part of their personality that they dont know how to deal with they will supress it push it down and lose most or all of their awareness of it. Its far too emotionally painful or anxiety producing to be aware of it.  Then that person splits that part of their personality off and projects that insecurity onto another person. They will strongly perceive that insecurity as part of the other persons personality. As far as they are concerned its a part of the other person not themselves.  The classic example is the homophobe. The person who has sexual urges towards the samesex but has been taught that is totally wrong and gross and they should be ashamed of it. So there is noway they could be even a little bit gay. They often get really angry that they feel that way and dont know how to deal with it and they suppress that urge and the angeranxiety goes away.  Then they see a gay person and they project their anger at their own urges onto that person and strongly dislike them for being gay.  That way they can lightly deal with that insecurity in an attempt to understand it but without having the full blown angeranxietyshame. What can happen is those people will constantly deny their urges and one day ... BAM their wife catches her heavily drunken husband getting fucked by a football team in the changeroom.  I dunno why the wife was going there to meet the football team too? Anyway she joins in and everyone lives happily ever after lol  So yeah a person who chronically projects a range of issues is splitting off parts of their personality and overlaying it onto other people. By doing that their interactions with that person isnt really with that person at least not in part. Its an interaction with themselves. Its distorted. It can get really full on sometimes and there is little basis in reality of the interactions much to the confusion of the person being projected on. Full blown narcissists are very good at projecting not saying this guy is that at all just a fun fact.  There is also a thing where the person being projected on can actually accept that projection as part of their own personality. It can be a feature of a narcissistvictim relationship.,DeadBedrooms,d9qor4m,3,t5_2t25p

In which case youre the silly hopeful one he was just being unalterably himself.Or maybe he straight out told you hed be feeling more into it on the weekend  in the evening hes just tired right now. In which case after n years of experimental observation it was time to believe his deeds not words.Or maybe you really wanted this relationship to have that artificially constructed quality missing from most of the natural world  the quality of fairness. You wanted to be rewarded for goodness with desire for self grooming with lust for your self control around other men with wild passion from your chosen partner.

I suggested that OPs wife may not like him attempting to undress her and touching her all evening. Its not accurate to call it affection if the recipient dislikes it. Being groped and pawed at is annoying and disrespectful and Im not the only woman who has pointed that out in this thread.

9640727,0,t3_5d0eoh,gt Then he made some asinine comment about it being BS that the LL spouse doesnt realize this.Its not asinine at all. The LL simply doesnt have a frame of reference to understand how something as unimportant or trivial as sex can cause so much hurt.  It can be almost as difficult as explaining the concept of the color blue to someone who has been blind since birth.   Of course they SHOULD simply accept their spouse at their word when they explain how badly they are hurting. gt Im still or beginning again not feeling any libido.Not having sex because they arent feeling specifically horny is a huge problem. There are a LOT of people who simply have little to no sexual desire until they start doing sexual things. We need to do away with the idea that one must be specifically sexually desirous before even starting.  Of course along with that we need to do away with the idea that the higher drive partner will be somehow damaged if sexual things are started and then have to stop because the other person just isnt getting revved up. ,DeadBedrooms,da1f24u,3,t5_2t25p

I wrote this book.  stop beating yourself up on all the signs you missed why you should have left before the kids all these things.  At this moment they are counterproductive to the issue and hand.  That issue is your mental survival and planning to go forward.  get yourself over to some mental health professional.  You need to stop keeping this to yourself get some coping skills and clear your head for the plans you have to make next.  Dont waste your time trying to talk her into going.  This is for you not her.  stop expecting anything from her at all.  Anything.  Cuddling sex backrubs anything.  Shes not capable to give it to you.  You are beating yourself senseless and she doesnt care.  repost for effect.  She doesnt care.  Let go of any expectation of consideration from her.  Its only hurting you.  She doesnt need your help to do that.  understand she holds almost all the cards here.  Dont fool yourself otherwise.  You cant bargain plead choreplay your way out of this.  She is in control of everything but the choices you make going forward.  your choices.  Be honest with yourself.  They are ask for permission for a playmate leave stay.  Thats it.  playmate.  You can ask but Id bet my house shell say no.  If she does say yes get it in writing so it cant be used against you in court.  If she were even remotely willing to explore this and cared about you shes have brought it up.  Why ask for permission instead of just finding a playmate?  If she agrees youre not cheating.  Odds of success here are single digits.  leave.  Nobody with a brain or heart would blame you.  That probably includes members of her family.  But if you chose to leave do so VERY CAREFULLY.  Assume she is the enemy who is going to do everything possible to keep you from upsetting her perfect world and will be ruthless in doing so.Find a mens domestic attorney.  They can guide you how to protect your assets get you custody Save your house and pension.  They can even find you counselors to help you find out how to explain this to your kids.  Only serve her with papers once they tell you its time.  stay.  The toughest choice with the most long term consequences.  I chose to stay because I loved being  dad.  My lack of sex was a unwelcome but worthwhile trade off for the joys I got as dad.  But choosing to stay is a brutally hard choice.  Be aware of that going in.Survival techniques.  aStop thinking of your wife as your wife.  Shes a business partner in Mr. amp Mrs. Inc nothing more.  bSee a therapist or clergy for mental and emotional support.  There may be support groups you can join.

Tearing things apart is wildly therapeutic.  I also took up karate.  Best thing I ever did for myself.  Strength discipline community.

If you make this devils bargain own it.eEscape strategy.  Once the kids are out are you gonna stay?  If not start planning today for  years from now.  Dont wait and hope things will somehow get better.Sadly there is no good way out for you.  Pick the best of bad options and work it as best you can.

I am the LL F in my relationship and I work very PT and am a SAHP so I completely understand how hard it is to feel sexy after a day at home with kids and to feel like the house is a den of romance.What I have started doing with my husband is this routine for the past week. When he is done work and the kids are fed he goes for a run and then comes home and showers. Then while he takes the kids and does the bedroom routine I have a bubble bath or shower but something where I have a few minutes to get my sexy on.I go downstairs and change the room so to speak. I put on a big fire we are in Canada and lay out a nice towel or blanket and get the massage oil. I wear only a tank top and shortspanties. When my husband comes down from putting the kids to sleep he knows that sex is on the menu and there is a NO tv or phones or media until this is over. I give him a massage and oral sex three times we have had piv sex. When we are done and satisfied we usually have tea chat for a bit and then its only pm and we still have the evening free for everything else.I hope that helps!,DeadBedrooms,dab4i3u,10,t5_2t25p

When I dumped my LL ex after  years I moved back in with my parents for  months and continued paying rent and utilities on our shared place because we decided she would be moving out as she couldnt afford either rent or utilities alone. When I came back after the two months I found she had absolutely cleaned the place out. She left me virtually nothing. She took everything from the furniture to the shower curtains and eating utensils. I had paid for nearly all of it as she was working very PT throughout the entirety of our relationship.

The other posters really said it all. Just like he cant force you to be aroused you likewise cant force him to lose weight. Im currently in the middle of losing weight. Its hard but it is doable and in the beginning all you have to do is walk x a week for  minutes at a time and monitor your calorie intake. Fitbit makes this super simple and convenient. It calculates your resting metabolic rate using your height weight age and sex. It uses that number to calculate how many calories you have to eat to maintain your weight and adjusts that number based upon your actual activvity e.g. My daily run adds an extra  calories to my budget. You can then set a daily deficit goal of  calories of intake below output. Ive lost  pounds using nothing more than a Fitbit a scale and successive pairs of walking and then running shoes. I did this by setting interim goals. First it was drop below  lbs then  then . Im now at  and Id like to hit  . If I can do it he can do it. I just turned  and now for the first time I weigh less than I did when I was . If he isnt on antidepressants he may want to consider asking his doctor for a script to give him a bit of a mood boost to make the exercise more palatable. One of my therapists told me that I had to retake agency over my life. No more could I say Im doing this because of xyz reason. I had to say I am choosing to do this whether it was something good I am choosing to work out even though I hate it. or bad Im going to eat this entire bag of chocolate peanut butter pretzel bites even though it is  calories..

I dont know enough about your situation to say but I know thats not why youre here.  I for one dont blame you for what happened although you cant argue that it wasnt intentional.  You chose to put yourself in various circumstances you had to have known would have led to at bare minimum a substantial opportunity.  Aside from that you fell victim to one of the biggest blunders traditionally associated with men.   You made what you consider a grave mistake.   You have justifiable guilt for your actions and intend on it never happening again.   You care deeply for your SO.   You never want to purposefully inflict harm on them.  And then you take the completely misplaced step of inflicting harm on him by telling him.  Youve compounded the degree to which youve undermined the relationship by ensuring that hes fully cognizant of the cracks youve created in the foundation.  You likely believe you did it to clear the air and to have no secrets....be totally honest etc. but thats wrong.  You did it to make yourself feel better and its come at an enormous cost that was completely unnecessary.  Youre struggling with the issues hes brought into the relationship but all youve succeeded in doing is lard another crushing layer of anguish on his back that neednt have been there.   Regardless of whether you each decide to try to make it work from here on out youve irrevocably damaged him.  Not because of the infidelity but because of choice to unburden yourself....purely for yourself.  He will unarguably see his difficulties with intimacy being the direct cause and whether or not that can reasonably be said to be true he has incontrovertible evidence that is so.  He was struggling to be the intimate partner you needed and now he knows in stark and vividly jagged terms what his inadequacies have brought about.

We were friends for a long time before we got together and he spoke about women people actually a lot and how they always wanted something from him. He was dead right about this everywhere he went they vied for his attention. If he did enter into a relationship they would always try to tie him down change him I was going to be the best I could possibly be. I HAD to come out of it with a clear conscience that I had given it everything I had. It would have been unbearable otherwise. And I got out so much more than I put in. When it stopped being good I ended it just like that btw I made sure to make him laugh delight him never embarrass him do all the sex stuff and learned a lot about myself in he process to never put myself down in front of him and to accept his compliments without protest.Years later he said to me I wanted to take you everywhere I HATED leaving you.

You might try assisting her by taking her for short walks outside the house  have her hold your arm and walk out the front door down to the next block and back.   Repeat these walks a little further each day.  In some cases conditioning therapy confronting the things that you fear in very small and measured doses can be successful in breaking through various social phobias such as fear of flying.

Since then it has dwindled according to his appetite and level of interest. He has told you hes not much of a sex person. You cannot draw blood from a stone. So... you can accept this and stay with him monogamously you can accept this and stay while exploring an open relationship if hes ok with that you can leaveYou are eighteen years old. You must not settle for sexual incompatibility. You know yourself to be a very sexual being. The best course of action for you is to leave the relationship and allow yourself to find one with someone who is more compatible in the bedroom.You are eighteen years old. Considering an open relationship is nothing more than seeking a soft landing to leave him. You may not see it that way but trust me. If sex figures highly in your needs from a partner you will bond so strongly to your sexual partner that your current relationship wont survive. I dont recommend you play it that way because your soft landing is not likely to be long term relationship material. You are young desirable and have your whole life ahead of you. You need to end it with not much of a sex person and move on. You will find someone with handsome qualities including a healthy sex drive and a loving disposition. You just have to start looking.Good luck,DeadBedrooms,dbescve,2,t5_2t25p

As a child she was mute for several years after her parents got divorced. It can get pretty excruciating when I am trying to have a super serious important conversation with her about our future and our relationship and she just tears up and tells me to go away and gets angry at me and wont tell me what she is thinkingfeeling.

10266411,0,t1_dc7ek2n,I can share my story to answer some of your questions.  Sorry this has turned out to be so long I guess I rambled a bit too much!!For me I was never really very sensualsexual unlike many LLs.  In the early days of our dating I did OK.  I never really enjoyed sex but enjoyed having sex because I enjoyed being with my boyfriend now hub.Then came careers house kids.  Those became my focus.  Becoming an adult meant giving up on youthful things partying every weekend camping trips festivals driving fast cars.......frequent sex.  Sex became a distraction to my being an adult.  Because sex was no longer important to me I just couldnt understand why he insisted.  I just saw it as carnal not really understanding how it related to our relationship.If someone doesnt have much desirecraving personal preferencehardwiredjust who or how I am etc it doesnt take much to override the little interest that is there.  When  LL is involved with lunches laundry job duties kids activities etc. then sex does indeed feel like a choreduty.  And even if LL has sex any way without desire those efforts are just not good enough of course barring some of the really cruel comments some LLs makeI resented being pestered and made to feel abnormal he resented being rejected resentment turns to anger downward spiral....no good.  For us nonsexual forms of affection and intimacy went away.He tried to tell me I said I will try harder.  I said fear of pregnancy he got a vasectomy  no improvement Hormones? doctors herbalist  no improvement were both too heavy both lost weight  no improvement Teenage boys are a handful empty nest  no improvement Job stress retirement  no improvement.  I wasnt just flinging bullshit......I was truly seeking an answer.All these things sound so familiar.  I knew so many other women who feel the same.  Can we ALL be so wrong? If so many other women feel this way isnt THIS normal?  Epiphany after one particularly anxietyfilled attempt at sex we had conversation about sex that had not happened in many years.  That included disclosure that my hub had had a couple FWB earlier in our marriage.  I also found some redditt porn on his computer.  I then got my own redditt acct and found the DB sub.  Reading those painful stories told bt HL spouses really hit home to me.  I did some real thinking about WHY I wasnt having sex.  I concluded that there wasnt any REAL reason no abusetrauma no medicinemedical reasons no religious upbringing just that I didnt want to.  I made a committment to get past that.Most HLs here are correct.  The problem will not be able to be fixed until the LL acknowledges there is a problem and sees the needwillingness to work on it.  Yes it is hard for an LL to be something they are not but they have to find something to make it worthwhile.  I usually recommend that HLs encourage their SO to read some of the stories heren this sub.  I encourage communicarionconversation about sex in general not LLs sex or or sex life but just generalities.  I also encourage both to keep nonsexual affectionintimacy in place for the benefit of the relationship while working on other issues.Hope this helps.....Good Luck,DeadBedrooms,dc7r56y,1,t5_2t25p

I picture you begging her for sex when her body is still healing and her begrudgingly giving a blowjob.You cannot wait a few months for your wife to heal from back to back pregnancies before seeking extramarital action? Do not get me started that you called a woman who serviced you a whore. Sure sure that used to be the term for a woman who was paid for sex but to me coupled with how you are otherwise speaking shows a disrespect for women. gt now i checking almost everyday for escorts never actually called.. but i dont know how long ill resistYou waited until you were  to have sexyou can wait a few months for your wife to heal. This is a woman with significant sexual abuse history. And what is the deal with the sex with her cousin? Was that coerced? She feels ashamed about it which is also a problem showing even more sexual baggage. I dont think anywhere you mention why she isnt having sex or what the conversations about this have looked like.

10391725,0,t3_5ot62o,Hmmmmmmmmm I dont know. Ive never heard of this type of fetish but Ive known men who get turned on by wearing womens underwear and bras and their clothes. Hahaha it kinda sounds like a you wont fuck me so Im gonna fuck your clothes and youll never know take that type of thing. Or maybe its the only closeness you get idk. Im just wondering do you think this is a fetish that will continue after you start having sex again? And  year is a long time to go without sex pregnancy or not. I fucked through all of mine and within  weeks after they were born...Im not saying theres anything wrong with not having sex while youre pregnant. Every woman is different and some lose their libido and it hurts for others. But does she know how hard it has been for you? She should be sympathetic at least for you having to go so long and a half assed handy isnt really showing it. Do you think your wife will be ok with this fetish if she found out? If not then just be careful to not get caught for now. It sounds like youre doing a pretty good job of it But you need to figure out if this is just a mechanism to cope with the lack of sex or if it is a real fetish. I guess youre just gonna have to keep clothes fucking until she fucks you though. Which hopefully isnt another year away. But anyway as long as youre not bothered by it and she doesnt know then I think youre good for now. Just keep doing what ya gotta do until W is ready. But if she ever catches you just be prepared for anything that could happen. I actually caught my ex jacking off in my bra and stockings. I flipped the fuck out mainly because I was confused and thought he was fucking some bitch in our house  seen someone in stockings through the window . Went all spy and crawled through the bathroom window and went to the living room expecting to catch him with a woman and I realized it was just him in my lingerie. It was a shock. I didnt understand. I thought he was gay. He said he just likes the way it feels. But I was so uncomfortable with it. Because I didnt understand it I was young. It was after we had our first kid too which is kinda odd when looking at your story too. I feel bad now because I can look back and see where other certain situations had happened leading me to believe that this was a big fetish for him but at the time I just thought that he was cheating on me. Like another time I found a whole bunch of womens underwear in his pocket. And he had been in the bathroom. He told me he found them in his moms closet we were living with her at the moment back when and they were some girls who used to live there. Well he told me he was jacking off with them but I really think he was wearing them now that I look back on it. Sorry Im getting off the grid. Im getting back on the grid Ok the point is she might not understand if she just happens to walk in on you whackin it in her shoe. So for now just hide it until you can figure out if its only due to lack of sex. If its not then ya you need to tell her because she will find out eventually.

Suffice to say i have bad back pain issues especially since i have a  year old son who wants nothing tobut to be thrown in the air over and over and over AGAIN DADDY AGAIN!! Lol any way I used to smoke weed as I dont want an opioid addiction and the pot helped A LOT. But over the years its been getting worse now it bothers me at work but i cant smoke a joint at work well I could but fuck that I discovered these vape pens with CBD which is the actual ingredient in pot that provides the pain killing. I was very skeptical but i tried it and low and behold about  minutes after taking the dosage  pulls the pain went away. For the most part completely. I know weed is not for every one but this will not get you high. Well im sure if you sat there and took  hits all in one go it might but its supposed to help with anxiety also. If you have no fixes wouldnt hurt to try. Cost me  monopoly dollars because CAD is all printed in pretty colours and it has  hits. looks like this I believe its extracted from hemp rather then the female variant of the plant. Check legalities of your area before use lol. Legal here in canada and again this is not sold as a device to get high. Its sold as a remedy.

10607868,0,t3_5ru0g4,Based on the fact that you are posting on here it is obviously NOT ok with you.  Trying to justify the situation by asking others to validate a situation that you are not ok with is only rationalizing what you know makes you unhappy.With that said it is great you are in love and want to be together.  You are already questioning yourself by making excuses up that probably have nothing to do with the situation.  It is important that you not blame yourself as you say he loves you and wants to be with you in every way and your issue is the level of sexual activity not attraction.  Depression and medication can be a part of the problem but truthfully it is about more than that.  Plenty of people are in similar situations and when you move past the life issues of different schedules and familiarity you need to discuss expectations now and make sure that you two are clear about what you think is appropriate and how realistic that is.  I would also suggest that you discuss ways to open communication about sexual activity so that you dont put yourself in a position where one or both of you become more frustrated which will lead to resentment and then anger.

It is pure conjecture with no certainty but what if he secretly yearns to do what you want him to do but is apprehensive to do so?

What youre doing right now is waiting around hoping for crumbs of affection from her and pressuring her around her job both of which are pushing her further away. If you get some independence and stop being so needy she may become more attracted to you but there are no guarantees. Its still worth doing though. Definitely stop pressuring her to get a different job and stop getting your family involved in this. She is using the job to avoid you so her getting a part time job will not help. She will simply have to find another excuse to avoid you other than her job. Give her some space because she is clearly feeling pursued and smothered by you. Focus more on yourself and find interesting stuff to occupy your time. ,DeadBedrooms,ddmfwt0,4,t5_2t25p

10760478,0,t1_ddpu9yx,We say a bedroom is dead when the frequency falls below ideal levels. It doesnt have to be counted from the last time you had sex. You might be thinking  months but again if you start from the pregnancy and factor in the postchildbirth trauma it was a lot longer for him.Im picking nits here because there are a lot of guys dont quite understand the physical toll a pregnancy can take on a womans body. Weve seen guys come through here who expected their wives to be ready to go not long after childbirth. I used to be one of them. If he went through over a year of a sexless relationship its very possible that hes harboring some resentment or anger or something. I dont know but its up to you to start exploring that avenue. I dont know the nature of the talks youve had with him but I noticed you said Ive explained the issue and how I feel... That doesnt include a lot of how he feels. Im not saying youre not neglecting his feelings or needs but many of us in this position make the mistake of just laying out the issue without considering how our partners really feel about it. Or just assuming they should be on the same page with us. Its a mistake I made definitely.So I feel you need to dig a bit deeper on his end. Dont just assume he should naturally want to have sex with you. Ask him how he feels about the current status of the relationship. Is he fine with not having sex? What changed? How is he feeling? How did he feel when you guys went sexless during your pregnancy?He may or may not answer you and his answers might not lead to more sex...but at least it can give you a better idea of what youre dealing with.,DeadBedrooms,ddpv3zb,1,t5_2t25p

10771332,0,t1_ddqy637,Yes things really turned around for us a little over a year ago. He had to change a lot of little things attitude timing habits and I had to recognize the things that got in the way of us being intimate and address them as well. A LOT of communication happened an exasperating amount. Every time there was an issue near the end. It really sucked and was awkward but I kept pleading my case and showing him how unacceptable him turning my down was when there were clear solutions. Basically I never turned away from the fact that regardless of reasons it was still a dealbreaker.But word of caution... my partner and I always had a very strong attraction and he doesnt have a whole lot of intimacy issues that plague a lot of partnerships that are posted about in here. So working with him on this matter wasnt so much a matter of pushing him to do something he wasnt interested in but moreso pressing him to change bad habits and attitudes that impeded the process of working on a fulfilling sex life. He was never ever defensive or shaming when I was upset with his refusal. He just couldnt reconcile that spending his energy elsewhere wasnt compatible with growing our partnership if that makes sense at all. He had to rethink how he was spending his time primarily and secondarily rethink how he approached the concept of intimacy not as something to do when the mood strikes but rather something to continuously work on and show.  ,DeadBedrooms,ddqzeuc,9,t5_2t25p

I was so afraid she would leave me that I never say anything when she accuses me all of these injustices. Its my fault for not being man enough to walk away from her when she treats me badly. Its my fault I havent demanded more. Its may fault I still stay with her. Its my fault that I didnt recognize that this relationship wasnt good from the beginning and would never be. Its my fault for ignoring the advice of my friends and my family about her. They were all right. She will never be anything more than she is and I cant change her in anyway. She loves me but shes behind her wall and will never let me in. Im not a priority and I ask too much to be close to her in anyway physically or emotionally. If I do anything independently she gets hurt because Im supposed to lay by the couch like a good puppy and be there for her when she needs me.  If I offer to include her in anything I insult her because I know she wouldnt like that activity.

10789642,0,t3_5ubh5v,I would say give him space regarding the sex. Be supportive encourage him to visit the doctor or a therapist and help him become less anxious.But you also need to decide if sex is a priority to you. You said its not a priority to him and never has been. Hes only  he will likely never change. Do you want to stay in a relationship that has little to no sex? You may want to consider being friends. It sounds like the two of you get along great in other ways so a friendship might be ideal. You are still very young and a relationship without sex can lead to a lot of resentment. It is not easy to leave a relationship that is mostly positive but sexual compatibility is a huge deal breaker in most cases as its a foundation for a strong loving relationship. Eventually you will have to choose what youd rather deal with. Time usually doesnt help though having open and honest conversations with him will. Pressurehints often cause a rift in the relationship.

10796445,0,t3_5ueliv,Is it actually pity sex or are you only perceiving it as so? A lot of people feel some type of way if they tell their partner something and then their partner does said thing because they think that the persons only doing it because you mentioned it. But is that always a bad thing? I mean maybe hes actually trying to put forth effort. If you react to him that way and he is genuinely trying to make a difference youre only going to sabotage your relationship further. There are people who wouldnt try regardless so if hes doing it because he knows how important it is to you thats a step in the right direction. I feel like meeting his advances with such a response will only reinforce in his mind that you dont love him that nothing he does matters anyway or that maybe you dont need to have sex anymore. The only way I feel like abstaining would make him more sexually available is if your libido and initiation emasculates him and he can start to take back that power. Have you told him that you feel that way about it  the pity sex? He thinks you dont love him or whatever. Have you asked or tried to understand why exactly he feels that way? Aside from sex I mean. Maybe theres something more you could be doing for him outside of the bedroom. Really though if his love language isnt sex and hes not the type to initiate and your love language is sex and you dont always want to initiate then theres really not much you can do if both of you arent willing to understand each other and take the necessary steps to fix it. ,DeadBedrooms,ddtkr9f,3,t5_2t25p

10805129,0,t3_5uj0t9,I dont blame my wife for a lack of a sex drive. She is a hardworking mother and I understand that at the end of the day she needs time to unrest and rewind. She doesnt attach the same priority to sex that I do.I dont blame her for not wanting to give blowjobs either. She doesnt like them and no matter how well I may groom or clean the environment shes never going to find it clean. Ive told her more times than I can count that Id be the happiest man in the world if I came home to a BJ. Or even if she wasnt up for PIV sex just a BJ before bed or something. She should know this but even if she does shes never acted on it. You cant force someone to do something they dont like.I dont blame her for not liking to receive oral. I love giving it and I would honestly do it everyday. Right before bed just eat her out to a few orgasms. I could stay down there easily forever but just give me  minutes a day and Im good. But she doesnt like it. I tried working out an everyday arrangement but I stopped after the third day when I looked up and saw her completely bored. Not her fault if it doesnt do much for her....What I DO hold her accountable for is her lack of effort to address any of these issues. She expects me to be monogamous with her yet makes no effort to try and meet or satisfy my needs. Shes happy with nothing why cant I be too? I do hold her accountable for the lack of regard for my feelings all the times Ive told her it hurts me or doing this simple thing would make me happier than any silly box of chocolates or neckties or whatever other gifts she might want to give. That just showing an effort would make me happy and Id love to work with her towards a mutuallysatisfying compromise. I hold her accountable for not making any effort on her end and denying me any opportunity to resolve the situation without her. I am upset when shes bothered if she thinks Im masturbating and makes some snide remark about it. And when I find shes been rummaging through my stuff looking for clues or evidence that I might be cheating. And Im especially pissed when shes affectionate out in public to try and make it look like were lovey dovey to other people when back at home she couldnt care less.For most of the HLs here were not upset that you have a lack of a sex drive. Were upset that you do nothing to address the issue. That our needs and feelings are brushed aside ignored. Being told that were wrong for feeling the way we do. That we should understand your POV more. That we should be less sexual. I wont try to make you someone youre not. All I ask is the same in return. If you want to date me knowing that I am HL then put in the work to make it work. Either find ways to compromise so we can both be happy or find a way to be okay with me getting it elsewhere.

Youre closed minded beliefs in this aspect is causing you to only see that which supports your belief ignoring the evidence else wise. Probably like youll ignore this.

It take so little to gain a dependence on them scary as hell. That said I would be very interested in exploring the concept behind his drug abuse and need of it for sex. From what I have seen opiate sex numbs the body essentially requiring more effort for the man to reach orgasm. Is it possible that he essentially numbed himself into requiring what he only seems to be able to give himself through masturbation similar to someone with the death grip from porn? Additionally your boyfriend hiding the masturbation by sending you away sounds really similar to a drug addict hiding their addiction are you sure he no longer does drugs?The issue with sex while on drugs MDMA Opiates THC Psychedelics is that the experiences can be mind blowing but when you arent having sex on drugs you feel like you are missing something.

11008601,0,t1_defn3ny,Yes I was referring to situations where there is zero sex in the marriage. Unfortunately this is far too common an occurrence. In that case especially the person doing the denying has ZERO say in what their SO does sexually. Many times these LL individuals even go so far as to force their SO to stop masturbating because that is cheating. I have never cheated and dont have an plans to either but that is just my personal choice. If others feel compelled to do so then I am in no position to judge them nor would I attempt to because I havent walked in their shoes. What I have told my wife repeatedly is that what I do by myself to relieve my sexual tension is absolutely none of her business. If she wants to be involved in my sex life I use that term loosely because its just an empty and shallow exercise designed to keep me from going completely insane then she can revive our bedroom but until then I wont even discuss what I do or what porn I view on the internet.

11036783,0,t3_5x1g6h,I dont demonize cheating at all.  I think it is like many human behaviors both problematic and understandable.  But this partPeople say Well if its that bad then leave. The responsibility of leaving is on the person who is unhappy. Not the person whos causing the unhappiness.If all falls on the cheater. The blame the guilt the regret and the shame. None of it falls on the spouse who decided it was OK and no longer give their spouse what they need. What they promised to always do.Its true  if its that bad then you can leave.  Its not that the responsibility of leaving is on the person who is unhappy its that happiness is the responsibility of each individual.  I think withholding sex is just as damaging to a relationship as cheating  but the difference is and why cheating is judged more harshly  lies in taking someones ability to make an informed choice away.  That is assuming the infidelity is hidden.  If the cheater is open about what they are doing then I dont think its any worse than withholding.  Because then if the cheatedon party is that unhappy she can leave.   But thats the difference  you know your spouse is denying you a fulfilling sexual relationship.  If you were to cheat your spouse would not know that you were denying himher monogamy.,DeadBedrooms,dej009q,2,t5_2t25p

We did have to abstain from PIV for about  weeks while I healed up but honestly we were so exhausted during that time period that we wouldnt have been having much sex anyway. And yeah we had less sex that usual for several months but we still made time for it. Now my kid is  and our sex life is great.

11171844,0,t3_5zenb1,From some of your replies to others comments it looks like youre already in an emotional relationship with someone. If you cheat with them itll probably end up being more than once. Do you want a full  on affair? Having cheated in my previous relationship I had both long term affairs and one night stands here is my take on it. What are you after? If youre just wanting to scratch an itch then a one night stand is ideal. Youre less likely to be found out and youll be able to assess your guilt levels. If you can see yourself settling down with this emotional affair partner then go ahead and have sex with them. This course is more risky as youre more likely to be found out somehow. And if you do youve got someone to rely on when the shit hits the fan. If you want to be with this person it might be just as well to leave your spouse now and get together with your friend ,DeadBedrooms,deybefb,3,t5_2t25p

11233683,0,t1_df56lym,gtOP I just want to add that it doesnt sound to me like your SO is sexually attracted to you. If she were shed want to be intimate with you in other ways than PIV. You say this a lot and Im not sure if its necessarily true. I will be the FIRST to admit that part of the reason I think this is that I damn well hope it isnt true otherwise Im in real trouble I have banged up against this fullstop in several discussions with my wife who has spent the past  months dealing with a chronic illness postPartum depression pelvic floor issue etc etc you already know me well enough to know the drill.I have told her almost exactly what I quoted you saying above because I thinkin large partit totally makes sense. In fact I have basically begged her to just tell me she wasnt attracted to me or give me anything to work with in this regard. Ok I say I get that you dont want PIV for a variety of physical and emotional reasons but why not anything else?!?! Her response for a while was basically I DONT KNOW FUCK YOU!!!  But after several talks what I was able to get out of her was that basically my sexual needs had become just another assault on her physical and emotional state. Her beleaguered body and mind worn down by  kids in  years intense special needs for one of them and a disease bent on destroying her immune system had her feeling like she was under attack . My desire for herand the accompanying pressurehad just  become another in a series of repeating assaults driving her to the brink. This in turn created a total aversion not just to sex but to sexuality in general.This was maybe one of the first things she said in our many episodes of The Talk that made sense to me and though it hurt me deeply I was grateful for it. While I still question her desire for me since we cut through all the bullshit and are becoming intimate again I feel a renewed sense of possibility. So while I totally feel what you are saying I figured Id chime in with my two cents since its on my mind and might be of value to the OP or others.,DeadBedrooms,df5bmkj,3,t5_2t25p

During the first year we were together we would stay up fucking multiple times per night until we were so sore it hurt to keep going but keep going anyway. After that first year we didnt do that any more. Sex gradually declined over the years but we were both still satisfied by the frequency and didnt reject each other. There was no HL or LL member of the couple. We were both down to fuck pretty much whenever the other person initiated even though we didnt have the burning desire that wed had that first year. We still enjoyed sex when it happened and neither person felt deprived and we both continued finding the other hot. This continued with the exception of pregnancy and babytime for  years.

If the weathers decent then open the door and walk out.  Walk for an hour.  Not only will it give you some space but walking is also an excellent exercise. When she wants to just cuddle then walk out.  And at some point you need to walk AWAY.  Youre not married  I didnt see any mention of children. If you intend to have a complete life youll need to find it with a different partner. Stop wasting time. Walk away. Sex is important  its one of the most important things in the world.

I would suggest you ask yourself whether you are abusing yourself both in general terms and in sexual terms.Do you think you use sex for ulterior purposes rather than what it might intrinsically do for you? Do you assume that your upbringing with your mother has had a serious adverse impact on you?What is it about your current partner that you find sexually attractive if all he is interested in is pumpanddump sex? To me that would amount to be being used by someone who has zero interest in your sexual and emotional satisfaction and health.Im going to suggest a tired old clich by suggesting that you really are in need of professional help. Your past is too complicated and too protracted to ever be dealt with by a general therapist. You need clinical help from either a psychologist or maybe even a psychiatrist. Dont take that as an insult it is genuine concern your problems and tribulations arent runofthemill.

11449610,0,t3_63fy4p,I did leave recently  but after  years of db  absolutely I would have left over a decade ago if it wasnt for the kids.  He was a very good stepfather and we had coparenting down...I didnt feel I had to right to disrupt everyones life because I needed sex.  Also not like I would have brought a steady stream of men into the kids lives anyway so I figured I was going to be celibate either way or it would be few and far between so why bother?I thought about leaving a lot in the beginning seriously less over the years as I just felt too broken and resolved that this undercurrent of emotional abandonment was just my life now.  I didnt have an end game where when the kids got older I was gone but thats how it happened.  Once my youngest started college I realized I was no longer staying to avoid disrupting their lives...I was staying to avoid an unpleasant transition.  I get how hard it is to leave when there are kids involved and sometimes its not always the right choice.  Yes I think kids are better off with two happy healthy households rather than one with a lot of acrimony  but they truly do not care if their parents are sexually satisfied or not so if they have the buddycoparenting thing down and for logistical or financial reasons its best to stay together than thats absolutely a valid choice.  No one in particular here but people often knee jerk about leaving and kids happier with happy parents etc.  Not everyone has the financial means to support two households comfortably and Mom and Dad arent going to be marinating in happiness if they replace the problems of a db with major financial issues or custody problems because some parents are absolute shitlords and use their kids to punish their exspouse.  There is a special place in hell for those people but they exist and when kids are small the courts can give the primary caretaker too much control over the other parents access.  Or a million other reasons.  Every circumstance is different and we all have a choice to stay or leave every day in our relationships.I will say I wish I knew what a db was when I married  it honestly never occurred to me that this was a thing much less a thing that would happen to me.  I do think people unmarriedno kids should run like hell with very few if any exceptions.  Run while emotional pain bad as it is is all you have to consider.

11543974,0,t3_64r4yq,Some people are ok with cheating but for others it crosses a moral boundary and puts them in jeopardy of lower self esteem shame and guilt self reproach or similar.  Once the bell is rung it cant be unrung so my suggestion is if you are in the latter camp of people who might feel bad about themselves after cheating take some time and be extremely direct and clear in your communication with your wife that a sex life is something you need and if you need her to be interested and participatory and not just offering disinterested quickies say that too.  Metaphorically hit her over the head with how important this is.  Ask her to participate in marriage counseling do not skip this step even if expensive.  Convince yourself that you truly have done everything you possibly could bear to do before stepping out.  From my perspective it would be better to end the marriage and be poorer but free from guilt vs someone who got away with something and justified it with anger but thats me.  Dont just accept the stalemate though whatever direction you decide.  Thats the worst of the options.  In another comment you mention childcare which means you have young kids.  Know that what choice you make will affect them deeply and for the rest of their lives so make a choice you can feel comfortable with while looking at them and thinking about their future emotional health.     ,DeadBedrooms,dg4ies8,5,t5_2t25p

I had to stop doing this only because after years of being the one who stepped up and complained I realized that it was one sided situation not to mention that I began to think very carefully about when I would confront my partner to ensure some chance of success and requited affection. For some people who dont really have strong physical arousal the psychological arousal of controlpower is satisfying.

If your partner has to MAKE you change you are doing it at best unwillingly which means you dont actually give a shit about their happiness.  If you cared youd make the effort yourself not because someone made you do it.  And if it took them leaving you to get you to understand that they were dead serious about what they had been telling you then you neither listen to them nor respect them.,DeadBedrooms,dgb2x3x,3,t5_2t25p

That is an imbalance of power. LLs can leave now or string it along with no downside. HLs can either put up with whatever the LL chooses to do or they can leave.

Its highly improbably that it will just disappear on its own.This is a real question think about it carefully and be honest. Exactly what is so amazing about him that after  months you would consider giving up sexual fulfillment and affection for the rest of your life? If you read around in here at all you will see that how you feel about the lack of sex and affection now will only get worse over time. Walking away from a relationship that isnt working on all levels after three months is going to be far easier and far less painful than    years from now after kids have been had and property has been bought and families have intertwined.Dating in your twenties shouldnt be a marriage interview it should be fun and carefree.

She just doesnt want to have sex with OP and doesnt realize while doing so is needed for a healthy relationship. And on top of that despite whatever issues an LL may have with trauma that is not a license to require the LLs partner to forgo an enjoyable and intimate activity. Too many LLs with trauma in their background refuse to acknowledge that they need to take actual steps to overcome it. They are instead satisfied with abstractly working on it without professional help and expect their partners to suffer years of nolimited sex while nothing changes or improves with the LL.

11803115,0,t1_dgxx37q,I was afraid I might read so. Since I am in that situation I read all over the internet and stumpled upon that topic over and over again.Hes by far not my first SO and thats the first time that issue occured for me. So it kinda took me by surprise.Sometimes I listen to country music or to rock and roll music and despite loving video games a lot I wish I couldve been born in an era without internet social media unrestricted porn and so on. Wheres all the romance and intimacy?I do think a lot about leaving but I still love him a lot and to confess I just wanted to make it work at least this time but Im getting desperate.,DeadBedrooms,dgxxa09,2,t5_2t25p
11804171,0,t1_dgxjo95,Thanks for your response!The first couple of times I brought it up she reacted pretty terribly. She didnt seem to think of it as an important issue at all and I was being a little bit insane. To be honest I broke it off with her for a couple weeks  years into the relationship due to this issue and basically because I felt as though we werent trying hard for each other anymore. BUT the last couple of times we talked about it she has been completely understanding and she often says she knows this is her fault and her battle and she needs to fix it.Again thanks for the advice. You have a pretty humorous way of writing if I might add haha.,DeadBedrooms,dgy1l10,1,t5_2t25p
11810309,0,t1_dgyperr,My point is that youre painting every person who cheats with the same brush because of your situation. He may not leave that may be correct. But that doesnt mean that he is lying to me about everything. You are refusing to see that each situation is different. There are similarities sure...but its like any relationship. Each situation is different and so is every person in that situation.,DeadBedrooms,dgyqmu4,2,t5_2t25p
