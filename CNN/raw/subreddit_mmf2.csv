37849,0,t3_1ujbaj,I did get in on the Humble Bundle and purchased MMF. While its pretty good I did pay the  to upgrade to Fusion . just yesterday.A few people seemed pretty choked that ClickTeam would include an oldobsolete version of their program in the Humble Bundle in hopes to get a bunch of people to upgrade. I guess I can see both sides on this one.In any case Im very much a noob when it comes to Fusion so I cant really say much about the differences between them. Apparently MMF with a bunch of extensions can accomplish most of what Fusion . can do from what Ive read on this and other forums. That said Fusion . does seem more streamlined. Some things are still located in what seem like odd places but overall Im happy.,mmf2,ceiqnrl,1,t5_2u1zo
