574629,0,t3_20ppaj,Guide to ship assaultsA good guide for people to see how to actually breach a ship without losing half their crew would be helpful. It is one of the hardest things for new players to wrap their heads around. Since ships tend to be full of aliens that are all watching the door it also ends up being the most deadly.,Xenonauts,cg5l8zr,2,t5_2sjbk

4391566,0,t3_3bavbb,Your mindset reflects the new XCOM because of its boardgamelike more predictable and repeatable nature. Its entirely viable to never lose a character. Xenonauts is more in the spirit of the original UFO Enemy Uknown in that its more simulationy instead of gamey. Its not a game where you always win if you make the right choices. Theres a bigger element of randomness involved and you have to accept that sometimes you will just lose people even missions no matter what you do. The game is designed this way with soldiers being much more replaceable than in XCOM. The aliens have a huge advantage on you especially at the beginning and unlike in the original games the advantage never completely goes away. ,Xenonauts,csknyma,6,t5_2sjbk

5992645,0,t3_3vbgif,Did you successfully evac your men? Just asking to see how others play the mission. My first time seven of my men made it to the escape zone on their feet two were carried in by their comrades my amazing Colonel assault got revived back at HQ my mediocre Lt. rifleman perished from his wounds one guy got caught by the reapers while guarding the rear. He was carrying a singularity cannon and fried several waves of reapers before perishing. That gun was just heavy for him to outrun them. I also had a hyperion which blew itself up.,Xenonauts,cy55zyz,1,t5_2sjbk
8458748,0,t1_d5yvg44,I certainly do not want to turn them off. But yes assaulting UFOs has been turning my guys into Swiss cheese. I also do not remember the escalation happening this quickly on Veteran but I have not played for about a year so it could just be bad memory.  Nice work.,Xenonauts,d5yvmdg,1,t5_2sjbk
9797156,0,t1_dakf220,I think a turnbased air game will fit the theme of Xenonauts significantly better  it will all be about turnbased strategy rather than having to react quickly. That being said I will wait to see what the new system is like.,Xenonauts,dakplx4,3,t5_2sjbk
