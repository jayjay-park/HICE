11693988,0,t3_66v0dw,The way this game works is that as you play more and get higher ranks the material the different parts of the machine are made out of improve increasing damage and hp. If youre using something right now like a wooden titan body at absolute maximum youll swap it out after  days if not today so you dont have to worry about using something in the endgame you have nothing youll use then atm anyway. Now for betting I honestly dont see the point. A  increase isnt really gonna help more than just sellingupgrading the part. I might be wrong about betting but I can almost guarentee that anything you have now will be swapped for a better part in a day or two,catsthegame,dglj5ko,5,t5_3k385
