894615,0,t3_24d7qo,I can share with you what worked for me. I always have to lanolize at least twice the first use. Also my babe is a heavy wetter and we go all night without a change. We have to add an extra Thirsties hemp insert to the fitted diaper. Sometimes two depending on what diaper it is. The wool isnt meant to take the place of absorbancy in a diaper. Its meant to absorb moisture and leakage so that it wont feel damp to the touch.  So make sure the diaper you use under the wool is absorbant enough. Also we dont put any pjs over the wool. We used to do a sleep sack and that was loose enough that it didnt cause compression leaks. The wool doesnt need to be tight it just needs to stay covering the diaper. Edit the only time weve had a leak twice is when I didnt lanolize the cover for like a month and a half and when it was a new diaper that wasnt fully prepped. ,clothdiaps,ch5z011,1,t5_2tisk

913540,0,t3_24jjmh,You might want to add a few prefolds just in case. Generally newborns need about  changes a day so if you want to wash every other day it would be better to add a few more. A lot of prefolds I have seen come in sizes. As a newborn you want a smaller size because you will end up with a lot of extra fabric if you get a larger size. For overnight some might use doublers. These are very small inserts that increase your absorbency. You should also try all in ones or pockets they are a little different and you might end up liking those better. ,clothdiaps,ch84iw3,2,t5_2tisk

1045476,0,t3_262tkb,Yes.  diapers in  hours is normal. Theres a few things you are going to want to check.  Laundry detergent Tide gives my kids hives most eco friend soaps Rockin green and such dont actually clean your diapers and can lead to rashes. Plus you never mentioned prepping your diapers.  As the other poster said. Diet. Is at an allergy? Does it happen after youif bfing or him eat?  Temperature it could be a heat rash. If its warm in your area and he is sweaty it could be causing rashes.  InsertsPrefolds Ive heard a lot of kids get rashes from microfiber diapers and inserts. Especially if you arent using a liner. Depending on the type of diaper you are using he could be reacting to it. Proper prepping sometimes helps this.  Wipes Are you using disposable wipes? Are they scented? If not are you using a solution? Or just water? I cant think of anything else off the top of my head other than taking a break from the zinc cream because it may or may not be working. Ive been cloth diapering for  months and never dealt with anything more than a minor rash because I waited too long to change her. But I hope this helps. Edit Oh! STOP the coconut oil! I dont understand why people insist that its a freaked miracle cream. Its an oil product. It has the potential to cause rashes. Edit  Now that I see that your bfing. Take a break from things like spicy food and milk. Both can cause gas and rashes. Coffee too. It took me some trial and error to find out what sets off my LOs stomach. Edit  bare bums arent worth the mess IMO. A clean dry diaper is just as healthy as a bare bum. And also are you bathing him? Too many bathes andor bath soaps can also cause rashes. ,clothdiaps,chn4isf,5,t5_2tisk

1400102,0,t3_2a48ue,I used to work for Sears Customer Solutions appliance servicewarrantycomplaint dept and knowing what I do about how they handle appliance issues I wasnt about to shop anywhere else regardless of what brand I went with.I went w the latest Kenmore steam washer and matching gas dryer w pedestals.  If you go w front loaders and hate bending they are a MUST .  Plus I got them on special w the washerdryer pair for  each.  Plus I like having the extra storage for things like extra detergent towels for cleaningdrying the dogs etc. wo having to put them on a shelf Im SUPER short. Anyway the washer and dryer have these fantastic my cycle buttons that allow you to save a custom wash cycle.  Put detergent in the cup hit one button and off we go!  Its brilliant!  I of course have mine programmed for diapers Prewash no detergent Heavy Duty hot wash cold rinse extra cold rinse Extra High spin.  This way not even my husband can screw it up.  So far I have not had any problems w the amounts of water it uses or any other issues that HE front loaders sometimes have.  Ive only used the steam function on the washer twice when I had some ammonia issues and they cleared right up.Both machines operate almost silently.  Thank god for that as theyre in the part of the garage right under babys room and I end up doing most of my laundry at night!I even have the my cycle set on the dryer.  Again Ive idiot proofed my routine.  It drys my prefolds on high for  hour min.  Theyre perfect every time.Another neat feature my units have is the Kenmore Connect diagnostics.  If something is wrong that isnt on the little reference cards they come with I call Sears they tell me to hold my phone up to the unit and it diagnoses the problem through the phone!  This way they dont waste my time or a technicians time in most instances they can send the tech w the appropriate parts on the first visit or if it is unrepairable theyll just send a replacement.  ,clothdiaps,cirs7jb,3,t5_2tisk

And whats best for that worn pooped in fabric is to get it rinsed cleaned the way youd clean anything else that has been peed and pooped on and rinsed of residual detergent.  I dont know what kind of diapers you have that you dont think can be washed in hot water but you can and should be using it.  Other than bat you need to make sure youre using the right amount of water.  Youll hear a million times that you need to use as much water as possible or your diapers wont get clean! Whats more important is agitation.  Thats what gets both the germs and detergent off. With proper amount of water an agitation they bounce off the agitator in the machine and each other.  Second you really need to just strip your diapers and start fresh before making all these changes and expecting to see results.  With my first wash with tide from rockin green I noticed my diapers didnt smell gross anymore and I had little to no staining.  It wasnt until after I stripped them did I realize that they were never actually getting fully clean with the rockin green.  third if youre still having issues with leaking after this and noticing that your diapers dont smell anymore or have other issues than you really need to look at the quality of your diapers as well as their fit which will more than likely be the culprit. ,clothdiaps,cjcqpm2,3,t5_2tisk

1784089,0,t3_2ex6kf,Unless your kiddo has an allergy to it you could just use regular tide.  I got tired of having freeclear just for diapers so I went with regular detergent fragrance and all.  I think it actually cleans better than the freeclear and it smells nice.  Weve had fewer instances of ammonia rash since making the switch too.  If your goal is to avoid putting a fragrance directly on the fabric try good ol drawer sachets.  I feel like im showing my age by suggesting them but they worked in the past!  Buy some dried flowers andor herbs and put them in a lace or mesh sachet bag and toss one in every drawer.

I just went to the fabric store and bought a yard of it for less than  bucks and cut it myself no sewing required.  It doesnt absorb moisture so it creates a stay dry layer. That did the trick!

That means one person will organize a giant buy for a bunch of people who only want a few things but theyll still all get that bulk discount. So the host decides what the buy is going to be so theyll announce ok were doing a Happy FluteAlvawhatever buy. Then theyll post a list of options usually in the form of photos so you can decide what you want to order. Youll fill in your order in a spreadsheet they provide along with all the other people who want to buy something and then youll pay for your order via Paypal or another means. That usually includes a small coop fee like a dollar or two but not shipping yet. Then the host orders the giant order from China or wherever which will be shipped to them in a few weeks. It takes a while usually so dont order from one in a hurry. The host will post when it arrives and then theyll divide and ship everyones orders. Youll pay shipping at this time and then theyll send it to you. If you dont pay shipping you forfeit the order and theyll sell it to someone else.Thats about it!

There are many variables at play here from water hardness level washer type detergent amount fabric types  to consistency of your load and so on.

Theres also traveling to consider and napsnighttime. Even if we didnt have daycare wed still use freetimes for grandparents and babysitters. They work well with a hemp doubler for naps or nighttime even because of the staydry feeling. Flats with covers are a compact travel option natural fibers wash and dry  easily and are trim but wouldnt last through a nap and grandma doesnt like folding.

4839170,0,t1_cu4hn7l,Are you using all free and clear liquid or powder? The liquid is not good for cloth diapers. From Fluffloveuniversity.com All liquid  Contains sodium cocoate which can coat fibers and cause repelling issues. Great for clothing as it reduces allergens but not good for cloth diapers. Contains optical brighteners.Along with All liquid causing repelling issues so do certain diaper creams. When you use synthetic fabrics pockets microfiber etc you dont want creams that contain petroleum as these will cause repelling. Zinc will cause staining. I suggest using liners. Prefolds can usually handle anything with a good wash routine. It may be best though to switch to disposables and use cream for a bit so you can also see if its your diapers causing the rash. The best rash cream I found was Triple Paste brand. It works wonders. Bordeaux and Destin did nothing but Triple Paste cleared it right up. Its not cloth safe though so again disposables or a liner. For your wash routine prewash should be a short wash with detergent that includes agitation and spinning out the dirty water. Dont use gentle you want a high spin and agitation to make sure poop is removed. Heavy duty on hot is good for the main wash also with detergent. You will need a new detergent though. I am partial to Tide Powder line  prewash and line  main wash but there are lots of options! I suggest going to fluffloveuniversity.com and using their detergent index to help you pick a new one and the correct amounts for each wash. As for the wipes try switching to just cloth and water if you have any extra fabric or baby wash cloths laying around. Or you can use Viva paper towel and water. Commercial wipes can be very harsh on newborns. Our hospital didnt even allow them. We use cloth with water and also order Water Wipes from Amazon.Edit to add when you dont have the rash any more I suggest Coconut oil as a preventative lotion during diaper changes. Its cloth safe keeps them moisturized and its antimicrobial and antifungal. The other really nice benefit is that when baby poops the poop doesnt stick nearly as much and wipes off so much easier. If I forget to put it on before a poo its like the poo is glued on. ,clothdiaps,cu4ikie,4,t5_2tisk

I just sold a lot of NB AIOs for a really reasonable price because I too felt that people charge too much for used diaps and I wanted to be fair. But between the PayPal fees and the time I spent investigating the cheapest shipping method and the time going back and forth with the woman about why the shipping was more expensive than she wanted and the cost of shipping which she only paid part of because I was just over it at that point I kinda get the higher than would be expected cost. I still want to be fair when selling used diapers but I definitely will charge more next time and I get why some of the prices are higher than expected. Also on the FB coop I buy from the cost of the diaper is only one of the charges  there are the coop fees shipping to host fees sometimes included in cost of diaper shipping to you fees PayPal fees and sometimes duty fees. A diaper maycost . but the real cost is often a good bit higher.EDIT I just realized that I kinda responded to some ideas on the thread and not to your particular situation.

6405207,0,t3_4242fv,ProsCut back on landfill waste. This for me is . Diapers are the third most plentiful thing in landfills and take hundreds of years to decompose. Save money over disposables. So much better at catching poop! My lo can poop out of everything but I so rarely get leaks with cloth. Tons of cute options out there. Lots of customization. Lots of styles and options to fit any baby. ConsWashing it takes time. It can be tough to coordinate around busy schedules since you have to do two washes and a dry. It takes way less time with a non he machine. It can also take time to get your wash routine down. You may get some fun smells while you figure out what works for you. Yeast rashes are more difficult. If your lo get one its a pita with cloth because you have to bleach with every wash. Or just switch to disposables while treating. They are bulkier. Clothes dont look quite as cute and lo will grow out of things quicker due to the fluffy butt. Also when  out and about the spare diapers are a space killer in your bag. Its addicting. Youll have all the diapers you need then see a print you love and have to have. Haha. I absolutely dont regret our decision go cloth diaper. ,clothdiaps,czhpgh2,1,t5_2tisk

6821548,0,t3_496vea,Im also a ftm and plan to cloth diaper. I went on amazon and bought several lots of these based on the good reviews and the fact that they are pretty simple. They are called AIO in the title but theyre really pocket diapers. I made some extra terry cloth liners and purchased a bunch of cotton flour sack towels from Walmart in case I wanted to make extra folded liners or actually use them as a folded diaper with these covers. Got some of the little diaper snaps a little three pack for like  cents on ebayI tried to buy based on others reviews and ease. There are a ton of options and in a way I think it almost feels like some people see it as a fulltime hobby rather than a function. If you view it like that the fact that there are so many options it becomes less overwhelming. Some people really get into trying different stuff or getting the brands. A Toyota Corolla can get me reliably to and from work as well as a BMW but some people just want the beamer. To me as long as the diaper holds up and serves the purpose of containing poop and pee without irritating baby I dont bother with brands or bells and whistles. From the research I did I found one of the biggest issues with people who gave up cloth diapering is not having enough of a supply to start with so they end up trying to battle with keeping up with the wash while keeping baby diapered. Also water quality can become an issue...if you have hard water you will have trouble with the diapers beginning to retain odors.

We stopped putting detergent in the prewash and max out at one line of Tide powder in he regular wash although we could probably use more now that the diapers have had several months to get idea of their excess soap load. You can check by putting your diaps on a wash cycle without detergent and then open it up and look for suds about halfway through.

We have a whole stack sitting unused. We also got  newborn AIOs Blueberry Simplex  rumparooz newborn covers  rumparooz pockets and  BG AIOs. If I had to do it again Id skip the Blueberry diapers and get  more rumparooz pockets. They werent very absorbent.

8593635,0,t3_4xgq7c,Do the prefolds! Theyll probably only fit for  weeks but then later you can use them as the worlds best night time doublers. Bummis actually sells a newbornpremie kit which has the prefolds bundled with xsmall covers for around Thirsties has an Xsmall sized cover and their thirsties duo wrap starts fitting at lbs Though GMD has photos of it on smaller babies. I personally used size small prefolds and small covers on my  lb boy starting at day . Im pretty Sure you could actually get away with using the newborn sized diapers on yours just fold down a  flap in the back before doing the rest of the fold. It will be bulkier but when I talked to my cloth diapering Doctor he mentioned that a little splay in the legs is perfectly fine it is actually how they treat hip problems.

This is where most people have debates because if you are into cloth to be natural or earth friendly it seems weird to use what some deem chemical detergent.

No water softeners as I dont have hard water. I do line  for prewash and line  for main wash and throw in the dryer. Going on  months and we havent had any problems. Also if you are wanting an easier option for liners go to walmart and get the . fleece throw blanket and cut liners. No sewing involved since fleece wont fray.

We loved the hook and loop Thirties size ones. Sadly couldnt get a good fit in size  and started preferring snap closure with older baby. For OS we use blueberry for fit around chunky thighs. LO goes  hours at night without leaking. We had an issue with the elastics on our Thirties. They have amazing customer service and replaced them. Rumparooz also had a warranty but the form you need to fill out has lots of questions but again good customer service.,clothdiaps,d9wqorm,2,t5_2tisk
9659353,0,t1_da2f4yx,Ease of cleaning would be covers and prefolds  thirsties or similar pul covers with prefolds. Diapers changes that are the fastest would be all in ones. If you are willing to prep the diapers ahead of time you could use pocket diapers. All in ones take a long time to dry but require no prep and are fast and easy. They make more laundry and need to air dry. They are also more expensive because you need more of them. They are like disposable just made of cloth. They allow you to put them on the baby and then snap or velcro and be done. Does that sound like what you would want? If not please let me know and I can give you other options. ,clothdiaps,da3pu79,1,t5_2tisk

10260938,0,t3_5mxq7l,First you need to bleach everything. This is always the case when you buy used diapers. Measure your water in a large tub or bathtub and add  tablespoon new disinfecting kills . etc bleach per  gallon of water this is why you need to measure your water! and mix. Then add all of your items and let soak for  minutes. Drain and rinse and then wash it all on a regular cycle with a proper amount of a mainstream detergent I.e. Tide gain wisk etc. But wont bleach well bleach things? Nope! The PUL that cloth diapers are made of is colorfast and shouldnt fade at all. In the properly measured ratio above it would cause at most minor fading on fabrics that arent colorfast. Going forward you can wash pockets and inserts and all of the different types of diapers together its no problem! Thats what I do. After washing I usually separate out any covers pockets or wet bags and line dry those while the rest goes through the dryer but you dont have to do that if its easier not to. What is your planned wash routine? A good wash routine that actually gets the diapers clean is super important to cloth diapering! You can check out fluffloveuniversity.com for help with a wash routine. They also have info on different types of diapers that might help you figure out what you have. ,clothdiaps,dc74t1w,8,t5_2tisk

We do use that though not very frequently.

10388011,0,t1_dclj36l,When I use cloth diapers I only do a small dab of butt paste on his butt and in his skin folds because they get red. At night I basically slather his butt with the paste since he may poop and not really notice for a bit. But if you arent putting any on normally it may not really be your problem.I actually just bought some Zorb  after looking at options for really absorbent cloth. I havent tried them out yet  just finished the first few inserts and they are in the washer right now.  layers of dimple zorb in the middle and the outside is in flannel. There are people who make the actual inserts with this material on etsy if youre looking for something quick. Ill also mention that out of the  brands I have Bum Genius Rumparooz and Charlie Banana Bum genius fit from the beginging week  after the umbilical finally fell even though now I dont think it would have mattered as much as I thought it would. Then the Rumparooz started not leaking as much closer to  months and now all of them work really well.Someone suggested that because the rumparooz were too big the lining inside them was always exposed to his clothes and that they wicked the urine away onto his clothes instead of onto the insert. Maybe that is the issue? I could definitely see some of the insert sticking out from inside his diaper even if I did my best to tuck that back in. ,clothdiaps,dcljny4,1,t5_2tisk
