3218226,0,t1_covkdfb,My mistake I meant it was Yasons garden the innkeeper  Raymond seems puzzled but amused by your demeanour and follows you eagerly. The Sandman Tavern and Inn is the largest and busiest building in town. People can be found enjoying food and beer here at any time of day. Yason the innkeeper is a grouchy old man who seems to despise his chosen profession. Locals often point out that the owner of the barinn doesnt drink or sleep! As you enter the bar you see two dwarves in heavy armor drinking at a table in the corner. Their heads snap around when they hear you come in but they relax and get back to their beers when they see you. In another corner there is a small rocking horse. Yason is standing behind the bar arguing intensely with a woman in the back room.,Riftvielrpg,covkkbr,1,t5_36x6x

3257112,0,t1_cozkl31,Dennis gives Raymond a kind of dubious look. He JUST SAW Raymond almost fall on his sword trying to catch a chicken AND THE CHICKEN ESCAPED TOO. Hes pretty sure Raymond wont be able to outrun ANY Kobold which means this is not a good idea. And technically Raymond counts as an innocent AND doesnt look like he actually wants to volunteer AND it really wouldnt be heroic to just let the town sacrifice somebody for whatever reason not if hes not actually volunteering. So clearly there is only one heroic option to take.Ill do it Dennis declares then proceeds to lecture everybody else shaking the dead chicken at them sternly.

3334781,0,t1_cp89tmi,You fool. This shield is made of pure magic you cannot puncture it. You may sit back and watch my transformation!The elf raises some herbs above his head and reads from an ancient tomb furiously. He then dips the herbs in a cup filled with thick red liquid and reads the final words. As he does a small blue orb appears in front of him. It begins to grow from the size of a marble to a tennis ball and then to a bowling ball. At this point you realize that it is not an object but is instead a hole! A hole in the very fabric of reality it appears. Veins of energy begin to pulsate from this hole into the elf. The elfs smirk quickly turns into a look of concern as more and more of the strange energy fills him. This look deteriorates into one of agony and the elf reaches for a set of  vials on the table. He grabs one and puts it near the hole and some of the energy seems to go into the vial instead of him but more still surges around the vial and into the wizard. Arrrrgggghhhhh the elf screams as his body is torn apart by the magical energy. Bloated and bright he looks as though he is about to explode. Moments later he does. A flash of bright light and a thunderous roar fill the protective dome of the wizard. After that the dome itself explodes knocking you on your back. Energy rushes out in every direction for a few moments and then all is still. The wizards body is now a pile of ash and his table of components is scattered all over the room.,Riftvielrpg,cp8e2yx,1,t5_36x6x
