Gosh darnet gee wiz trust score . tell them your secrets! Fun facts about josvermeulen     Ive had tanks without fish where these plants would grow and be unkillable.     I am dissapointed  The most important part is your filter media should stay wet and aerated.     Ive used it quite a lot.     Ive never seen this before.     Ive never seen in wild caught and lower Fs thats why I was worried.     Im a very big fan of them.     Ive used it.     Ive never tested or know anything about.     Im a noob when it comes to plants.     Ive kept bettas myself have only one now.     Ive seen live past  years even past  though not much had cold water changes so Im very much inclined to believe it matters.,KnifeFish,cwrl68s,1,t5_30wbw
