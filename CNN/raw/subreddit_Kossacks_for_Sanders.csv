But I am increasingly compelled to believe that the Revolution cannot be polled.     Hey KOS what about near future science fiction Explain yourself please! MetaYes polls may be propaganda designed to make us surrender hope. If so  EPIC FAIL  We will not surrender hope and we will fight harder. POLLS? POLLS? WE DONT NEED NO STINKIN POLLS!   BUT REALLY HOW DO YOU POLL A BRUSH FIRE?   ANSWER YOU CANTEstabocrat polling models are deeply flawed in as much as WE exist beyond the imagination of a highly centralized power structure. Remember Dont tell the trolls this is because we are the ones with the crazy dream and that is the secret to our success.    If you dont believe me motherfuckers here I quote directlygtCorporate Estabocrats are the demented offspring of the dirty clusterfuck orgy of Money Media and Politics. And polls have one main purpose today To give one corporation an indication of where to spend money to buy media time from another corporation in order to purchase results in the commodified open market for name brand candidates.Polling mechanisms are the perverse masturbatory terrain of the Estabocrats and WE exist outside of that terrain. Estabocrat polling science is not calibrated to measure political revolution and thats how and why we have them where we do.Regardless on your views about masturbation one thing is clear Outside of this debauched toxic cesspool in a mason jar WE are evolving into an incredibly diverse and yet coordinated multicellular organism. We are mobile and adaptive. We are guerillas and we have gone viral.    What about personal manifestos that condemn the establishment but dont name names?HERES ONE THING I STRONGLY BELIEVEThe longer we can exist outside the imagination of those thought leaders with their hands on the Estabocrat meat grinder the better chance we have to succeed.,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d0tb2mb,1,t5_3czby

6858919,0,t1_d0tlu3h,Ok I just did ... I think I might have figured out whats going on which is a noobie mistake about how things workshould work.I thought when you submitted a link that you could submit a Title a URL and also some text to explain  say a few words about why the URL is so great.I was hitting submit link adding a Title and URL and then hitting the Text tab at the top to add the text.  I think what that does is basically change my request from submit link to start conversation when I click the Text tab it is interpreted that I hit the wrong button and meant to hit start conversation instead.  This is the process I had been following I was always hitting the submit button at the bottom of the Text tab.Apparently submit link only allows you to specify a Title and a URL.  This time I made it a point to be on the tab that had the URL on it when I hit the submit button ... and what happened is that the submit link was executed and worked but the text I had submitted on the other tab was discarded.Sooooo it turns out the error seems to be user misunderstanding although I think reddit would be better if it worked the way that I thought it should work.  Even when you submit a link you still are starting a discussion about that link.  Apparently today you have to submit the link and then you can go in and add a first comment to have a similar effect of what I thought it was going to do in the first place.Can you follow what I am saying?  This is kind of hard to talk about. Maybe there should be something in the Wiki? But if Im the only one that had this problem maybe not ...

6873784,0,t3_49vljb,Thanks for this really great pep talk!  Last Sunday amp Monday I phone banked for Michigan and will start on Ohio tomorrow.  I followed the script which has a lot of psychology to help the person think of themselves as a voter and then visualize themselves going to the voting location.  I watched the tutorial on the script.  As recommended before going live I read the script out loud a few times and this helped a lot.After getting my credentials login amp password I watched another tutorial about the Bernie dialer.  There is livechat help available which I used several times and they were great!!Just before going live the first time I reviewed everything one more time and noticed that I was supposed to be ready to look up the voting location if discovered that my voter had moved to a new address because thats one thing you do is verify where they live.  This never happened but it would have flustered me if Id encountered that and then needed to ask my voter to hold on while I navigated to the right berniesanders.com lookup place.  Once I had that new tab in my browser set up I took the leap.By the rd call I was feeling comfortable.  Any time I indulged in thoughts of better things to do I thought of Bernie amp Jane and their incredible effort.  Im age  and hard to think of running around amp speaking as Bernie is doing and being away from the comforts of home.Once I got started I found it to be quite elementary.  I just trusted in the truth that the psychology of this is powerful.  I encountered no rudeness whatsoever.  One call where some woman in her s or s? answered my ...can we count on your vote for Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday? with not likely was the only slightly negative response I experienced.  I kept on script and gave a genuine ok thanks for your time and have a wonderful day response to her.  Her response to my positive wishes included a slight pause and then some words that I dont remember.  In hindsight my impression is that she might have been ready to argue with someone and was caught off guard by being thanked for her time and wished a good day.  Who knows...that positive interaction could have turned her into an active Bernie voter??  Nobody knows but I believe in staying positive so its how Ive filed away the experience.  And who knows maybe she just broke her leg or something...and her response about what shed be doing on Tuesday had nothing to do with politics.  Nobody knows.My second day of calls was amazing.  Most of them were strong Sanders supporters and lived across the street or around the corner from where they voted.  I sensed they couldnt wait to vote!  I could not get Elizabeth to stop talking about why she supports Bernie.  For one thing as she told me her yearold daughter can have Social Security too if we implement Bernies plans on that.  I listened and enjoyed her enthusiasm...and watched for my opening to finish and get to the next voters.Final word is that these calls are not about convincing anyone to support Bernie.  You are calling people who are in the records as Bernie supporters for whatever reason.  First step is to verify that...and if the person conveys that they are not you thank them for their time and move on.  These calls are to use the proven psychology of getting that voter to take action.  I have noticed over the years that people I consider to be political admit at times that because of how their day unfolded they blew off going to vote.  These calls are about planting the vision of voting in their minds so that they dont do that.Im someone who much prefers email communication over phone calls.  I have an iPhone but it is kept OFF most of the time.  I have it for when I need to make a call.  I only answer it when there is a plan in place with my husband or daughters.  So phone banking was initially getting way out of my comfort zone.  It soothes my conscience to do this and help pull my weight in making this revolution happen.  And Im doing it for my two daughters.,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d0vgfj7,3,t5_3czby

Sixtyeight percent of voters age  to  sided with Sanders compared with  percent for Clinton. is lower than in many states. This is looking a little like some of the Southern States just not quite as intense. We will need HIGH turnout and the only way to get high turnout?

She was chosen by an  margin among black Democrats and  by Hispanic Democrats.PLEASE phone bank facebank ask friends to phone bank with you offer to buy them beer or dinner and canvass if you are in or near the area. or ALL of the above.

We must help him together now before the clock runs out. Now put that hand back down and pick up your phone. In five to ten minutes youll be up and running and helping Sanders get elected.

7210241,0,t3_4e7f2n,My understanding is that there are about  emails on Hillarys server containing verbatim excerpts from supertopsecret communications on the SAP system.  Whoever put them there  presumably one or more aides of Clinton  committed a felony that is a slam dunk.  If the FBI can demonstrate that Hillary conspired in this she also will be indicted.  Moreover it is virtually self evident that setting up the server in the first place represented a conspiracy to evade the FOIA  and entailed putting all the emails she sent or received as SOS  many of which had to contain sensitive info  at risk of being hacked.  When Hillary set up the server did she just presume that she would never be discussing state secrets as SOS?  She would have to be brain dead to assume so.  And the FBI is also trying to find evidence of quidproquo for foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation or to Bill for his speeches and subsequent or previous favors conferred on foreign entities by Hillary as SOS.  It is less certain whether such evidence will be found but the FBI clearly feels that hiding such evidence was the underlying intent of having a private server.  Does anyone sane believe that the Clintons have earned  million for speeches after Bill left office simply because plutocrats love to throw away their money?So my analysis is that at the least one or more of Hillarys top aides will be indicted and that there are ample grounds for indicting Hillary herself if the FBI is willing to be aggressive.Whether or not hacking of Hillarys server led to a serious compromise of secret info is legally irrelevant.  If a cop stops you for driving  mph telling him that you did not cause an accident will not impress him  the fact is you put the lives of others at risk needlessly.  Which is precisely what Hillary did.  ,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d1xqxus,15,t5_3czby

So Democrats there are quite disenfranchised and frequently have no Dems to vote for in US House and State SenateAssembly elections. The th District where I used to live is one of the most rural districts in the eastern US but there is a Berniecrat running there.

7238245,0,t1_d20xfpt,Shes been doing it all election of her career. It is SOP for the Clintons. Bills Sister Soujah moment said he could distance himself from blacks and not pay too high a price. It is risky. That is why IMO the Clintons are so distrusted and hated. Yes there is a right wing conspiracy against them but you dont see that same level with other Ds because other Ds dont operate like this. Now weve got the Clintons complaining about a left wing conspiracy because so many people like me with my exfriendbusiness partner are finally on to them and are calling out Hillary for her lies and smears against Bernie. These are all her unforced errors  miscalculations on how some underhanded tactic would play out. Yes it is very risky. It is IMO why she lost against Obama and why if she squeaks by Bernie and doesnt get indicted she has a very good chance to lose the GE because shell miscalculate one too many times or miscalculate on something really big just once. Plus she is a very weak candidate overall. Even when she wins except for her diehard fans there is a bad taste left in the mouths of a lot of voters. It is why Is shun her. You can see when she wins it is with tactics such as Bills in MA criminal disingenuous attacks lies etc. where she faked out or scared enough people to not vote for Bernie rather than having a positive message.  It is April. We have almost  months till the convention. If she manages to win in Philly you can be sure it wont be clean. Then well have almost four months for her to shoot herself or be taken apart. Contrast that with how it would go if Bernie wins the nomination. Take a look at Berniecrats.net The politicians joining the revolution climbs every single week. With Bernie as the nominee the Ds have a very good chance to take back Senate and if not the House a big chunk of the R majority will go away  and those remaining will understand that the game has changed. ,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d20xp9j,13,t5_3czby

Our primary is nowhere near as closed as NYs since more people here know enough not to selfharm by registering Ind in a closed primary state.  The western part of the state is filled with Republican leaning registered DINOs who will probably prefer Bernie .  Pennsylvania has a much stronger population ratio between its upstate v. Philadelphia than New York does v. NYC.  Philadelphia does not dominate the state at all.

For this reason those who show up will be better informed and more coordinated than in . The other difference isI hopethat the police will not be so hostile. The Bernie revolution encompasses the concerns of average working class whites to an extent that  did not. I read a great account of a Bernie rally in Philadelphia in which a police man was interviewed. He did not present himself as a Bernie voter but indicated that he and fellow cops were aware of Bernies message and sympathetic in principle. He also said that his son was a big Bernie supporter. Lots of cops today unlike in  have children who are going to college. No way are they going to open fire on these people.On the other hand the establishment and media are way more prepared to run propaganda counteroffensive against the march on Philly as some planners are calling it. They will portray it as an undemocratic attempt to strongarm delegates into supporting a candidate who has not won the majority of pledged delegate.

The periscope feed has been down for  minutes.Edit  At  Eastern according to mikepfarr the section that included opposing privatization of service was also voted down. Also the Periscope feed is now back up. Sanders supporters are being told to stay.Edit  At  Eastern according to the periscope commentary Nina Turner has shown up with lawyers and they are in the process of a complete delegate headcount. Also pizza is outside the room with police food.Edit  At  Eastern theyre just letting candidates come up and pitch their platform and story. Nothing interesting is happening yet. Sanders delegates are trying to get a motion to remove the chairman but are being stonewalled. Food pizza has arrived. We did it Reddit!Edit  At  Eastern someone at podium motioned for recount. Chants of Recount Recount Recount are everywhere.IMPORTANT Edit  At  Eastern the chairman just came up to the microphone put the motion up to a vote or something did not allow a proper vote counted the motion as voted down while not even allowing the Sanders voters to say anything and said the convention was concluded even though A nobody knows if theyre a national delegate for the national convention B motions were on the floor C multiple agenda items were not completed. Sanders supporters are going nuts. They are shouting There is a motion on the floor There is a motion on the floor.Edit  At  Eastern according to the Periscope Sanders supporters are now being arrested.Edit  At  Eastern Sanders supporters are not leaving.Edit  At  Eastern Sanders supporters are not doing a sitin. They are leaving the room. They are not happy.Edit   Eastern Sanders protesters are outside somewhere supposedly.ImportantSPECIAL EDIT  Eastern Basically at the end of the day the chairwoman committed electoral fraud by fraudulently not allowing a fair vote for the recount.Multiple motions on floor ignored while Chair made new motion to accept and was nd. Nays never spoke when accepted.nvdemconvention tweet from qwestieI listened to the entire proceeding and watched it from periscope  and it happened exactly like what qwestie tweeted. The Sanders delegates wanted normal rules back not changed and a simple recount. They were never allowed either one.Instead of honestly allowing a motion for a recount the chairman slammed her gavel down . seconds after asking for nays. Given that there was no time to even react by the Sanders side in those . seconds the chairman said passed. She then concluded the convention and walked off the stage. Never before have I seen such dishonesty.The chairman acted in incredibly fraudulent ways changing the rules in a strange way when Sanders supporters were still checking in not allowing all the Sanders delegates to take part  delegates were disenfranchised not allowing Sanders supporters to offer up motions passing unilateral motions by voice only with only the chairman having the power to make the call of who won the voice vote calling up security to secure the stage and microphone preventing Sanders supporters from asking for a motion continuously ignoring motions and stonewalling and the most egregious was simply shutting down the convention so as not to have to recount after a motion was passed and then fraudulently ignored.Everything is on tape from a guys periscope video feed   lt this one is the best one wait a few secs. and  and Essentially the moment for Bernie supporters to vote on the motion was . seconds. They were disenfranchised in their own partys state convention. They had been trying to kick the chairman out ever since the new rules were shoved down their throats unexpectedly. They were trying to do a simple recount and reinstate the Roberts Rules the normal rules. Also no one knows who the national delegates are that will be going to the national convention. In addition the  Sanders delegates who were not let in were never let in. They were not allowed to petition or have a hearing. A minority report that was barely allowed to be read in front of everyone said as much.The relevant hashtags to search for tweets are nvdemconvention freethe teambernienvPROTEST time is scheduled  Protest of nvdemconvention forming at Nevada DNC  am.

In what possible way is it realistic to continue voting for the lesser evil when we have an ongoing climate catastrophe no mainstream Democrat or Republican is willing to discuss let alone actually do something significant about? During Obamas first term he even pressured environmental groups to stop or tone down their discussions of climate change. Each lesser evil candidate just happens to be a greater evil than the last one. Each of their politics are unimaginable even as one is in the throes of the attacks on basic human decency engendered by the last one. The slogan of the Democratic party is it could always be worse while the promise is it will always be worse.

Feinstein and her husband have been tied to questionable dealings between the worlds largest commercial real estate firm and the U.S. Postal Service. Feinstein has also been accused of abusing her position to award her husbands companies billions of dollars in military contracts.On May   Feinstein cosponsored PIPA. In January  Feinstein met with representatives of technology companies including Google and Facebook. According to a spokesperson Feinstein is doing all she can to ensure that the bill is balanced and protects the intellectual property concerns of the content community without unfairly burdening legitimate businesses such as Internet search engines.After the  mass surveillance disclosures involving the National Security Agency NSA Feinstein took measures to continue the collection programs. Foreign Policy wrote that she had a reputation as a staunch defender of NSA practices and the White Houses refusal to stand by collection activities targeting foreign leaders. In October  she criticized the NSA for monitoring telephone calls of foreign leaders friendly to the US. In November  she promoted the Fisa Improvements Act bill which included a backdoor search provision that allows intelligence agencies to continue certain warrantless searches as long as they are logged and available for review to various agencies.In June  Feinstein labeled Edward Snowden a traitor after his leaks went public. In October of that year she stated that she stood by those comments.I have no idea how California keeps voting for her.

7827353,0,t3_4mi54i,Just days ago I encountered this talking point from a longtime liberal friend who I see  times per year.  Shell vote for whoever gets the Dem nomination but until our conversation she was fine with Hillary cuz my friends not the political junkie she knows me to be.When I brought up the FBI investigation she said but Colin Powell did it too...not combatively to defend Hillary but to use her best understanding of the situation.  Im sure Ive planted important doubts in my friends mind now...even had to clarify to her what a server is and expand from there.My takeaway however was how effective that talking point is.  I think its important to separate the Benghaziemails subject from the Chappaqua setup...which does involve emails.  Referencing both these situations with the word emails helps fool people like my friend who either dont know what a server is andor arent political junkies.I myself agreed with Bernies dismissal of this last Fall in that first debate because in my mind the word emails had lumped together the Benghazi witch hunt with the FBI investigation...which at that point hadnt reached the Pagliano immunity stage.But when Pagliano got immunity I started educating myself.  Now any time I talk about this corruption I never use the word emails...and mostly use the word server.  Then if my listener has to admit not knowing what a server is its a good opening to clarify how Chappaqua was not a mistake but a very deliberate amp planned conspiracy...the difference between a parking ticket and a drunk driving arrest as the author here aptly puts it.,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d3vv09y,5,t5_3czby

She made it as far as the Democratic convention losing out on the nomination to George McGovern but leaving a lasting impression.gt  Im sure you meant party nominee after the convention just wanted to throw in the info about Chisholm as she was so badass and cheerful and unstopable so much like Bernie.  She founded the Congressional Black caucus by the way and I cant help but think she would have hauled John Conyers sorry ass to the dunce chair for endorsing Hillary.

Years of varying amounts of isolation and nihilism begins to whisper in my ear... But really I guess for me the only reasonable way to go forward is to be a lot more deliberate about what kind of people I seek out. Maybe putting a larger emphasis on not ignoring problems I see with someone early on. One person I know I feel he could have gone either way in life he always had an undercurrent of intense egotism in him but it was counterbalanced until it wasnt anymore. I probably wouldnt give someone like him a chance now.  Those are good suggestions. I live with a cockatiel and shes very sweet and curious in her own ways...gt an impossibly large sense of responsibility far beyond the ability of any mere human.I hate to concede it but I think you may have definitely pegged part of me there. The other half of that life experience being that I then feel very ornery for falling short of what I would want to do except for the fact that Im always falling short. There might be a bit of the romanticism in me there in the Victorian sense but damn I do not know how to maintain it. I can see how this damages me but at the same time I cant accept things how they are. Climate change oligarchy a million different flavors of oppression. I cant accept that and I feel that oppression oftentimes feels like silence passes for consent and so I cant be silent but here I am burning out again...I dont have balance I dont even pretend I have balance I hope I never tried to let on that I have balance...I really do have to emphasize... climate change its exactly as bad as it sounds. The DOD says that its an existential threat and theyre correct. I would like to just rest and say its out of my hands and leave it at that but... tick tock tick tock. You know we have two people who are frontrunners who do not take it seriously and not to be melodramatic but I think theyre not stupid they know climate change is a catastrophe upcoming but theyve written off hundreds of millions of people as acceptable losses the way they do in the military.

Its liberating to feel that the best thing I can do is to actually vote my conscience.  Even in the general election.  Even against the threat of a Trump presidency.  I never really was a Democrat before.  I was a liberal.  I was a progressive.  But I was never really a Democrat.  I wont allow the Democratic party to hold my vote hostage anymore.Aside Im sure by now youve heard the news  My condolences.    ,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d45l62l,1,t5_3czby

7916161,0,t1_d45o2ht,Talked to some friends today and that was pretty much what happened.They brought up people they knew who are Bernie first Trump second and made them out to be complete idiots. When I said that its actually not that ridiculous they acted like I just said the nword. I fought back a bit and at least got them to admit that Bernie and Trump are both antiestablishment so if thats what you care about it makes at least some sense to be for both of them over Hillary.I said that when Hillary says Trump is disgusting he could respond with then why did you go to my wedding? The response I got was literally I dont care about that. My point wasnt that it was important but that when Hillary criticizes Trump he can use it to deflect. I didnt keep going because I was pretty shaken from getting shut down so quickly.Someone said that people who think Trump is a liberal plant are crazy conspiracy theorists. I suspect that Bill put him up to it but I didnt have it in me to go there. I certainly cant prove it but I dont think its crazy to suggest it might be true.Then we got into the media and I said that Comcast is for the TPP and its in their best interest to promote it on their news shows. They did agree that the TPP benefits Comcast but things were getting really tense and I didnt feel comfortable pushing into early calls and antiBernie bias. Thankfully we moved on to other topics after that.It doesnt bother me that people dont agree with me. Its how fast I was shut down. None of these people like Hillary. Theyre all disappointed that shell probably be the nominee although I doubt they would qualify it with probably. And yet even the mere suggestion that Hillary would not just be a bad president but would be a downright horrible one was met with almost complete dismissal.These arent people that I can throw away. This is my inner circle. Im closer to them than I am to most of my actual family. Ive been trying not to bring up politics around them but when they bring it up my options are to say nothing and feel like I have no voice lie or tell the truth and look like Im crazy.,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d45unty,2,t5_3czby

Thank you for your Committee service!I have already put my main two suggestions on Bernies I want your suggestions for the platform  webpage but Ill repeat them here so you can see them.. Whereas even the mere appearance of being beholden to special interests is antithetical to the proper functioning of the democratic process both of the smalld and larged variety no person who has ever been a paid lobbyist shall be a Democratic Delegate or Committee Member of any type.  . Whereas the veracity of the US voting process has been called into question the Democratic Party shall pledge to do whatever it can to ensure that all future elections shall conform to Carter Center Democratic Election Standards for international election observation. If for some reason this cannot be done the Democratic Party shall pledge to do whatever it can to ensure that all elections in the United States shall be performed in a way in which voter intent can be verified by hand.If nothing else the actual debate against these two would be interesting.Again thanks... and good luck!,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d4q6zsu,12,t5_3czby

8245067,0,t3_4sbgil,If anyone is interested in a much better critique of both Hillary and Bernies attitudes towards black voters here is a startWake up! Both Democratic candidates using the same tired gimmicks to get black votesgtFor example Sanders supporters are shocked that Clinton has maintained high levels of black support despite her participation in efforts to pass the  Crime Bill which Sanders voted for and the  Welfare Reform Act. However that shock ignores the fact that black opinion on this legislation was split at the time. Many elite and middle class blacks were deeply concerned about the significant spike in urban violence and what was often framed by even black academics as the debilitating effect of welfare dependency on the black poor.gtEven those that disagreed with these measures at the time may have placed greater value on President Clintons record on other issues that affected them more directly  like rising black wages and homeownership rates.gtOn the other side Clintons AfricanAmericans supporters like Congressmen James Clyburn and John Lewis who blast Sanders proposal for free public college for threatening the survival of HBCUs shouldnt be taken to speak for millions of young black citizens who would appreciate the opportunity to enter adulthood debtfree or lowincome black parents stressed about providing for their childrens education.gtRather than embrace these complexities the chase for the Black Vote has encouraged the candidates to make broad appeals like ending institutional racism and to compete over who can more loudly recite activist slogans and chants. Hillary Clinton has performed the regrettable dance most skillfully leveraging her army of influential black elected supporters and her underestimated skill for empathetic retail politics.gtMeanwhile Sanders in a foolhardy attempt to pander for the Black Vote has tripped over his own feet radically adjusting his platform to accommodate protesters one moment while waffling against black intelligentsia criticisms the next. In addition to Spike Lee hes made Blist black celebrities like Killer Mike and Danny Glover the face of his Black Vote outreach. To black voters its more like Sanders is selling cheap cell phone plans than political revolutions.gtHis extraordinarily poor showing amongst South Carolinas black voters in Saturdays primary reminds us that all nonestablishment nonblack candidates who play the Black Vote game will do poorly  and deservedly so. Until progressive candidates stop treating black voters like secondclass citizens they should expect to do no better than a distant second place.  gtIts time to wake up.,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d586taq,1,t5_3czby

Its impossible for  of any group to agree on anything.The racists voting for Trump the religious zealots voting for Cruz and the prowar blood gurgling nationalists that support the GOP in general  all these voting blocs still exist within the black population. Unless you subscribe to racism and believe theyre some kind of special group above tribalism.Sanders got around  of the white vote about  of the black vote. He lost because there are white people who vote GOP because of their identity over policy and ditto for black people who vote DEM because of identity and the GOP being so goddamn racist.Conservative prowar Protestants are not going to back the neutralwar Jewish guy. And no conservative likes feeling powerless  Ericas ad might be effective in appealing to progressives but those are a bloc he already had on lockdown. It probably cost him votes.I think its really important for people to grasp this. When you express an opinion you open yourself to people disagreeing with you. Bernies campaign was nothing but a long line of opinions. Hillarys was a cocacola ad and she never gives an opinion on anything except how much we need to murder people abroad.Having no opinion lets these two groups liberals conservatives who completely disagree with each other project whatever they want to believe onto that person.

8254748,0,t3_4sff9z,Jill Stein has for years been very consistent in saying that lesser evil voting is counterproductive that it produces progressively greater evil over time and that its not possible to effectively challenge the monopoly of money by working within a political organization as deeply compromised and controlled by the financial elite as is the Democratic Party.Stein wont win the presidency in  but there are still some worthwhile and realistic things that can be achieved by supporting her.  To begin with substantially improving on her vote totals of  would provide further impetus for a political movement that challenges the hegemony of the two corporate parties.  Also garnering at least  of the vote nationally would qualify the Green Party for federal funding.  And lastly Stein has a shot at getting into the presidential debates if she can consistently hit  in the national polls.For anyone who embraces Sanders narrative about whats wrong with our current system and what needs to be done about it I can see no upside in embracing a candidate who exemplifies the systemic dishonesty corruption cynicism and brutality that hes been decrying for his entire career.  By providing progressive cover for Killery Sanders now becomes part of the problem rather than part of the solution.Jill Stein is a courageous and noble individual who has never compromised or backed down from her principles.

8280728,0,t3_4suk9x,Right on brother. Fully agree with you that we need a DemExit today and not after the convention. Copy pasting a comment I made yesterdayProgressives still get to vote for any Progressive housesenateother candidates the DNC puts out. By staying in the party were letting them live in the illusion that theyre progressive and have values which is very dangerous because it gives them legitimacy that they dont deserve. If Progressives leave the DNC now or postconvention it sends a strong message of rejection against their core values of corruption cheap tactics and sucking corporate dick. Id rather people leave now in large numbers instead of waiting till the end of the convention. Were not going to win any recounts closed primaries or floor fights at this point because of how rigged the DNC is and especially not after the endorsement and the exits that have already happened. The DNC will always keep coming up with excuses to keep us in the party for one last thing. The cycle needs to break somewhere. We can only win by a unanimous decision by the superdelegates and that has to be inspired by something big and drastic. Theres no point lighting a low flame under the DNC now we need a bomb to get their attention. A big exit  before the convention will cause an emergency and signal the superdelegates to consider overturning their nomination of Clinton. By staying in the DNC you are implicitly saying that you support Hillary for President which is not only damaging to Sanders but also intellectually disingenuous to yourself. Nothing confirms youre BernieOrBust better than leaving the DNC. The time when our leverage mattered is over now the bad guys have won and theres no point commiserating with them for a few empty sentences in the party manifesto or a few more pledged delegates. We need bold action and theres nothing bolder than the DNCExit. Until a week ago I was advocating for staying in the party but Bernies endorsement changes things dramatically even if hes not ending his campaign. all of this is just my personal opinion and rationale for my own actions even though it sounds very presumptuous and pontificating. Kids dont try this at home. Stay safe and vote Hillary.

It will be spun as meaning that women cannot hack it if she is defeated.  Which is ridiculous of course complaints about Clinton as an individual is what would motivate most of us to turn her out but there it is.

Somehow you just completely ignore that... That is obvious no wonder you had to mischaracterize it as though both points somehow contradicted one another to make your point.We all know how many of the dems behaved when Republicans won they took the message that going further establishment was the mood of the people in the s s and s and when Republicans had their fun in the early s many democrats supported it we know what they did when third parties even appeared to have affected the race in  and the effect its had on normal peoples perception of third parties yet now you want to give Republicans on steroids more of a chance to win again  thinking youre doing something progressive to boot seems legit...Now the mood is finally progressive thanks to Bernie forcing it on them and people using his name want to give power directly to a donor for the first time in history thinking itll somehow make things better amazing... Own that make sure you can explain to the families being shipped out why you fought so hard to make sure theyd be scapegoated by the person who was elected no more blaming cnn first time in history a donor was given free reign and his first official action was to let Heritage pick SC nominees and nobody bats an eyelid at how extreme that is they actually think increasing the odds for this to win is progressive shocking...,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d7y7101,-2,t5_3czby

Im also discouraged about the establishment in the Democratic Party and its obtuse obstruction to the need to reform into a welcoming Peoplebased Progressive Party.But I do feel positive about all the issues we cared about in the primary.  It feels good to come together and put our energy into fighting for issues we care about like Standing Rock and stopping the TPP this year just to name a few.  So perhaps we should focus less on the divisive and awful presidential election and more about individual issues where we can have some unifying and POSITIVE action.,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d80hbzz,11,t5_3czby

9328572,0,t1_d8yengz,I hope that someone covers this article from one of the emails links.Addressing a Goldman Sachs event in  in one of the speeches that WikiLeaks published on Saturday Mrs. Clinton gave a toughminded realpolitik answer to the question of how to handle a problem like Syria. If the best chance of success was to act secretly inside that country she made clear she had no problem doing that.She went on to say  as her audience already knew because of revelations in the news media  that as secretary of state she had advocated secretly arming the Syrian opposition Which is Al Quada and moving forcefully to counter the Russians who at that point were supporting President Bashar alAssad but had not yet fully entered the conflict.My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene she said in answer to a question from Lloyd C. Blankfein the chief executive of Goldman Sachs which paid Mrs. Clinton about  a speech to give what felt like an insiders view of the making of American foreign policy months after she left office.But she quickly acknowledged that we used to be much better at this than we are now.Okay first why was Blankenfein asking Hillary a question about her foreign policy views? The answer is that banks make a lot of money funding wars. People thought that Hillarys speeches to the banks were about her economic policy but what else did she and Bill talk about during those speeches?Obviously it wasnt just about their economic views. But she quickly acknowledged that we used to be much better at this than we are now.Now you know everybody cant help themselves she added and officials go out to tell their friendly reporters and somebody else Look what were doing and I want credit for it.The three hacked speeches from  that WikiLeaks published most likely with Russian government assistance help explain how Mrs. Clinton approaches some of the worlds knottiest problems. They are a reminder of the coldeyed way she often assesses her most vexing opponents when the television cameras are not on.Coldeyed ways is a nice way to say sociopathic IMO.Hillary is a threat to humanity if she is elected president.,Kossacks_for_Sanders,d8ygqu5,1,t5_3czby

So the corporate candidate can support whatever identity issue you can come up with and fracking and the TPP then when you call them the enemy theyll call you a racist homophobe.Im one of the minority who simply doesnt think that Trump is homophobic at all although hes got a monster for a VP and is only racist to the degree that most rich Manhattanites are racist this is a guy who attends gay weddings and defended OJ Simpson long after the verdict as Chappelle said on SNL the Simpson verdict was the last time I saw white people as angry as they are about the Trump win. Hes rich he doesnt give a fuck. The only things that truly make him sick are people who work with their hands and their backs which makes him very similar to Hillary and the Hillary supporters who are protesting him.You cant fail to address black people as black people gay people as gay people women as women natives as natives etc. though. Its very easy to improve the lot of the working class as a whole and leave all of those groups behind or even have them fall further behind. Not addressing black people as black people early on in the primary got Sanders off to a very slow start with black people although his improved messaging by the end picked up the more media savvy of us mainly the millennials.The most important thing for the left to do when it comes to identity politics is to be specific. The corporate consensus wallows in generalities about identity politics and is short on actual achievements  and counts things like changes in terminology and official commemorations and pomp as achievements.

This Wednesday night Our Revolution will be live streaming an event with Bernie Sanders and Keith Ellison. Ellison is the leading candidate to replace Donna Brazile as chair of the DNC. The location of the event and one of its participants lead me to believe that Our Revolution has already won over a significant chunk of Hillary Clintons base of support.gtThe headquarters of the American Federation of Teachers is where the event will take place. Randi Weingarten the unions president is participating in the event which is focusing on Congressman Ellisons vision for where he would lead the Democratic Party.gtWeingarten and the teachers union endorsed Hillary Clinton early. Weingarten was one of the fiercest supporters of Secretary Clinton and has a lot of sway with Clinton supporters around the country. Her support of Keith Ellison Bernies choice to be chair signals to me that at least organized labor has joined the political revolution.gtIf you remember shortly after Trumps victory there was a rally in Upper Senate Park organized by Our Revolution. The rally which featured speeches by Bernie Sanders Tulsi Gabbard Keith Ellison and Nina Turner also included many labor leaders who supported Clinton. The chair of the board of Our Revolution is Larry Cohen former president of Communication Workers of America. It looks to me like Cohen has succeeded in bringing labor on board.gtAnother thing to remember is Cohen is cochairing a critical commission charged with reforming the nominating process. The Unity Commission will have seven members appointed by Sanders in addition to Cohen. The Clinton Campaign will appoint nine members. The next party chair will appoint an additional three members. Keith Ellison is the heavy favorite at this point to win the chairmanship. Ellison the cochair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus was the first elected official to endorse Bernie Sanders. A  majority would be enough to guarantee substantial changes in the nominating process. There are signs however that many in the Clinton camp are open to significant changes...gtThere is no indication that happened this time but the silence of Hillary Clinton in the process of electing a new chair leads me to believe that Bernie Sanders is now the de facto leader of the party.gtI may be wrong but the handwriting on the wall is indicating that Bernie played his cards right and is now poised to transform the Democratic Party.

10855612,0,t1_ddzmpxf,Bernie seems to be betting a lot on the election of Keith Ellison as DNC Chairman and that Keith would help correct this.Personally I think Ellison will simply continue with The Establishment Agenda that the DNC plans to carry out.  The Establishment is simply too powerful and funded by billionaires to make much of a change and I dont believe Keith will be able to overcome that.  Also the DNC membership is chock full of Hillaroids that dont see any need to change and they want to see Hillaroid given her crown that she is entitled to.  That would be the goal.  Also DNC is shown to be a criminal organization with the likes of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Donna Brazile in charge.  They arent going away.  I mean look at Donna Brazile still head of the DNC as a self admitted criminal.  Also just think about that Hillaroid who heads the Nevada Democratic Party she is the epitome of a Hillaroid and she has no plans to do anything other than continue worshipping the Hillaroid at all costs.,Kossacks_for_Sanders,ddzoh6a,1,t5_3czby

10943629,0,t1_de89xmi,You really need to look at the history much more closely. TR had nothing to do with FDRs elections either in NY or nationally beyond the family name.FDR was installed in the Governors mansion by the NY Banking cartel because he was a reliable Patrician. When he betrayed the party with his New Deal the bipartisan efforts to get rid of him began. His endrun around the nations rulers by appealing directly to the voters was the key to his success. So in that respect his effort was similar to TRs.Ive been listening to dissatisfied and angry Democrats talk about taking over and changing the party for about  years. Ive also watched them fail to accomplish anything during that time.The Parties are private clubs that exist to keep power safely away from the likes of us.And just as this election should have shown everyone they will not ever give up that position ever. They will happily lose elections and betray every principle they claim to hold in keeping power for themselves and away from us. They will support and pass republican legislation and vote to lock up people that complain about it.If you are going to play a game and hope to win you first have to understand what the game is who your opponents are and who makes the rules as the game goes on.,Kossacks_for_Sanders,de8ratx,5,t5_3czby

When you were  or  you bought your first house.  By the time you were twentyfive you had a bigger house because you were probably married with two kids.  You had two cars in the driveway and neither car was older than two years old because you could afford to buy a new car ever couple of years.  If you liked to fish you had a boat and a cabin in either Minnesota or Wisconsin.  If your kids were old enough to travel you went on vacation every summer and often made the trip to Florida.  There were no staycations.  When it came to paying for your kids college educations tuition at a public college or university was only a few hundred dollars.  This lifestyle was attainable on one paycheck.  Im not saying that some mothers didnt work outside the home or that some people werent poorer than others but it was a much better lifestyle back before the Reagan recession.I stopped telling that story to my students.  The looks on their faces told me they treated it like unbelievable government propaganda.  They intellectually understand the midcentury American economy but the experience is so far from their reality that they just cant process it.I live in a bedroom community which is a suburb of Peoria.  Back in the s the area was one of the fastest growing areas of the United States as people flocked to the area for the high paying jobs.

Apart from the Civil War that navy was very small until the turn of the th century largely engaged in coast defense and antipiracy patrols. Not many in Congress had an appetite for spending limited federal dollars on a peacetime military given our strict neutrality. The CinC title didnt mean much in peacetime but it did allow Lincoln who had no military rank to assert his authority over his generals and newly created admirals the rank had not existed in the US Navy before  which came in handy when he had to fire one. Woodrow Wilson who presided over the first really large military deployment since  the Civil War by and large entrusted the conduct of the war to the War and Navy Departments although he did issue Persing written orders not to allow US troops to be simply parcelled out as replacements to serve under British and French command. GW Bush wasnt the first to be enamored of the title Nixon and Reagan also made a point of using it often maybe because their own service histories were so unimpressive in comparison to others like JFK Carter and Bush Sr.,Kossacks_for_Sanders,dgbfkms,1,t5_3czby
