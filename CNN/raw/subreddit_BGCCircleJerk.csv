10075347,0,t3_5k0kg8,Wtf Buttercup is straight up lying now!I posted a comment with links where she was extremely nasty but deleted her comments later. Shes now claiming she never posted that comment or that she never said  when she did. I know this for a FACT because I reported her comment quoting what shed said to someone else as a mod. It would have made no sense for me to do that otherwise. I am  certain that it was her and of how she reacted to that merkup girl  but because she deleted the comments like a coward she is trying to pretend it was someone else. Absolute bullshit.Does anyone know how to get deleted comments back? Im only familiar with the wayback machine and unfortunately they arent saved. Would be awesome to get hard evidence of her making shit up and then denying it.,BGCCircleJerk,dbku80p,15,t5_3hdy3

How can you actually be that socially oblivious?,BGCCircleJerk,ddgq1aw,5,t5_3hdy3

10855635,0,t3_5v6hu1,Jacyln Have never watched her didnt know who she was before BGCKathleen Cute but her videos are sort of dullJStar I used to watch his videos but unsubscribed after the initial drama. Everyone harps on him for just existing which I dont get. But what does get me is how shitty and unapologetic he is when interacting with others. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Nikki Bubbly but tries too hard and sticks to halo eyes. Means well but forgets she publicly supports JStar. Manny Never watched him I only know of him from BGC. Cassie Used to follow her for the not like other gurus thing. Eventually unsubbed because that initial charm wore off and I realized how boring the videos were. The initial tweets of her being insensitive were disheartening but jesus christ the hate boner for her is unnecessarily long. Jackie Aina Love! Very detailed very informedinformative. She is very classy and I absolutely adore her videos. Everyone else like Nichole Guierro Desi Chloeetc etc etc WHO?? I swear every thread thats like Desi THOUGHTS??? I have no idea whats going on. Have never seen or heard of these gurus outside of BGC,BGCCircleJerk,ddzok94,8,t5_3hdy3

11103428,0,t1_deqjutl,Youre so right. Im not trying to play the goodguy or whatever but I usually comment and get a lot of heat in the sub for not letting people say unwarranted things without being checked. I only follow the sub because some stuff is interesting like the J stuff and helps me make more informed decisions on what I buy from a moral standpoint. I hate the way that people seem to hop from one target to the next there currently JH for some reason. Its the epitome of mob syndrome or a bandwagon ,BGCCircleJerk,deqkbd3,17,t5_3hdy3

11664363,0,t3_66eakq,Im dying with the girl who thinks its ok to be called a currylover because curry is delicious. Dying. Girl beans are delicious too but if you call me a beaner be ready to catch these hands. Also this reminded me of one time I was hanging out with friends at an old style Mexican town in New Mexico. All of us are Hispanic. We kept seeing all these sombreros and sarapes and mariachi suits at stores. One of my friends turns to me and says I dont get it. Its cool to wear this stuff? If we wear it we would be fashionable? I told him Sorry but no. We would be told to stop wearing this stupid shit to adapt or to go back to our fucking country. Also all the looks we got for speaking Spanish at a Mexican style restaurant. It was the cherry on top ,BGCCircleJerk,dgi65d4,64,t5_3hdy3
