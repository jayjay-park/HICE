5643830,0,t1_cwwddso,gtI originally didnt like the idea of commenting on these traditional symbolsI think that if you want to avoid the topic which you do seem to want to do you need to say here are these traditional symbols but they arent the only ones. Certainly when you then go on to use traditional symbols as your examples angelic voices is a staple that has been used for nearly a millennia if not longer.. due to the involvement of singing as part of religious worship just like bells have the spiritual connections for a variety of reasons to do with sonority history etc.Are you trying to differentiate between traditional symbols in the sense of contextualmusicologist interpretations and other symbols in the sense of modern day layperson interpretations?I think its important to note that many of the symbols we have today developed from contextualmusicologist interpretations and are built up organically in the mindset of laypeople through repetition and use over and over again. That doesnt mean that the symbols being suggested by musicologists composers and critics are any less powerful for not being yet in that stage of repetition or as with angelic voices past that stage of repetition but rather that it is an interpretation that can be offered.Theres other more modern ideas of symbology that are directly relevant to the things you mentioned that are fairly well known and also easily seen by most people that could be interesting. I already talked about the use of bells in Russian music but its worth noting that Soviet music took that and then used arrangements harmonies and melodies that invoked the idea of bells and so adapted the semibanned notion of bells into something that was more permissible to the antireligious communist state yet borrowed from the same ideas of instrumentation.... and in doing so helped to create ideas that are used by spiritual composers like Taverner and Part to today though the notion of spirtuality is so badly defined that I really dont want to get into that either.Normally the argument over symbology is did the composer mean this or this rather than does the listener care for what the composer was doing and that might be because I take it from an analytical academic point of view and you dont... but I still think the divorce you make between intentions and outcome is somewhat spurious I dont think you can divorce from the composers intentions that much whether or not youre trying to make an argument for the layperson to follow. Especially when the lay person is likely to have noted the symbolism subconsciously but without reflecting on it consciously.Does it matter if James Horner uses violins to symbolise emotive power in The Bicentennial Man if the lay person doesnt realise thats what hes doing? Because even if they dont realise that its all symbolic it still has an emotive effect thats built up over centuries of that symbolic representation that is being tapped into.I think Im getting off topic a bit and Im not sure that my rambling is useful so Ill cut it there and you can query the bits that dont make sense or that are contradictory or Ill edit it in a bit to make a bit more sense.gtany examples of these that you could suggest would be most extremely helpful.I mentioned a few in an earlier post. I have a list of them somewhere in my research for my papers on film music but the ones that I remembered off the top of my head are mostly to do with ethnicities  accordions symbolise France or possibly South America if its Piazollaesque due to their history of being used by French street musicians.  bagpipes symbolise Scotland  the Sitar is often used for India and other similar countries Turkey anythingistan  tribal drumming normally is used for Africa and other regions of limited development ie. rainforest natives  solo steel string or classical guitar is normally used to evoke Spain the spanish or certain areas of eastern Europe like Transylvania arguably such as in Alan Silvestris score for Van Helsing  the koto is often used to signify upperclass Japan or traditionalist ideas such as Samurai whilst the lowerclass will be represented by more traditional music. Theres a whole load of japanese flutes that are also used to inspire the sound of Japan but those are more complicated because of the use of nonwestern flutes to inspire rurality.  Speaking of which you get the whole array of flutes and pipes that say hey look were in the countryside! or hey look rustic village! These are much less precise and I dont really want to go into them in a list like this as the difference between them is arguably not noticeable to the uneducated,moviemusic,cwwo6tk,1,t5_2sgn3
