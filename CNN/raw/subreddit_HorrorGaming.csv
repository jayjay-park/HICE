1036168,0,t1_chlv3tp,I would have enjoyed the second one if there were a bit more supernatural occurrences. I liked those in the first game. ,HorrorGaming,chm2fhw,1,t5_2w4bb
1397857,0,t3_2a28zx,I love survival horror. I think the term has evolved to mean something different to what it used to mean though. Back in the day Resident Evil  was called a survival horror now when people hear the term they think of The Forest. ,HorrorGaming,ciri32x,2,t5_2w4bb

1836252,0,t3_2fk6mx,These clowns are trying to tell us our favorite SURVIVAL horror games? Then they include  actionhorror games for slot  and . Bafoons. They should have just included Super Mario Galaxy you know there was that one creepy moment against Bowser . . . My top five would be more like  Silent Hill   Silent Hill Shattered Memories  Cry of Fear  Siren Blood Curse  Penumbra Black Plague. Honorable mentions Lone Survivor Haunting Ground Amnesia TDD Outlast. ,HorrorGaming,ckagqc5,0,t5_2w4bb
1877668,0,t1_ckfg5y7,Any chance this will come to vita? I find that I am more likely to play an indie game on the vita than I will on pc or even ps. I really like the platform for horror games as it can have a similar personal feel to reading a good book in bed at night.,HorrorGaming,ckfgadp,2,t5_2w4bb
1911565,0,t3_2gh3um,The game entertaining only a few times got too much hype in my opinion.,HorrorGaming,ckjj5bp,1,t5_2w4bb
1925254,0,t3_2glkwy,theres a thread in rcreepygaming that covers some of the things in this teaser.The numbers represent possibly a alphanumeric swap  a bc etcThe audio recording appears to be a reversed reverse arranged they seem to have cut it up and arranged it to play in order but backwards recording of Robert Oppenheimer reacting to the Manhattan project test.here is the thread with more info than I listed hereThis is the type of stuff I love. ,HorrorGaming,ckl6goc,2,t5_2w4bb
1966867,0,t3_2gn7bv,Oh man this looks like the bastard lovechild of Dead Space and Silent Hill. Im buying the shit out of this game.,HorrorGaming,ckq7iru,1,t5_2w4bb

4076175,0,t3_376y3x,Im a huge fan of these type of games. I dont want to create an overwhelming list but Ill just list some that pop in my head immediately. The Dark Eye. Not so much a game but more of an interactive first person experience. Game or not it is one of my favorites. If youre into Edgar Allan Poe then youll definitely dig it Ive never played it but the th Hour is known as a classic in the genre There are a few free ones in the Mega thread about free games but one of my favorites on that list is Exmortis Uninvited. I played the Windows version. Its difficult without a guide since it is timed but it can still be fun Scratches. I was told it is great but I couldnt get into it. Ill have to try again sometime in the near future but here you go There are also a ton that are not in first person. I know you primarily want first person perspective titles but I Have No Mouth and I must Scream is definitely a classic one but it is in the third person perspective ,HorrorGaming,crkws14,1,t5_2w4bb
4080485,0,t1_crl7fi4,Yeah I know thats because im still a little shy by talking while recording and tend to overeact to the scary situations. Thanks for taking the time to giveme some feedback bro I will try and work on what you said D really appreciate it.,HorrorGaming,crlefza,1,t5_2w4bb
4307003,0,t1_csb478s,nice I have a x. I was mostly wondering about other games and settings.was thinking of maybe grabbing a couple  nanos to feed  monitors. Currently I have a in sony bravia P which was cool a few years ago but the pixelation is starting to bug me.,HorrorGaming,csb4i5b,1,t5_2w4bb
4384080,0,t3_3b1lq3,Im sure there will be warning labels on VR games in the future like we have for roller coasters. Heart condition? You might not want to play this game...,HorrorGaming,csjtlq9,1,t5_2w4bb

4734694,0,t1_ctqxukm,Traps would be great. Something thats not direct combat but some way you have to actually use your brain to stop them. I like the run and hide approach to horror games but its getting stale and I would like to see it evolve. ,HorrorGaming,ctrcmzb,2,t5_2w4bb

5321120,0,t3_3nv8o2,Thats actually really neat. And it allows them to be more creative and different in the remake.,HorrorGaming,cvru306,2,t5_2w4bb
5539931,0,t1_cwio7e4,gt then you found out is that it constantly attacks you in scripted sequences and every single time you just pass out and wake up somewhere else and continue to the story like nothing happenedYou know what other game does that? Amnesia.,HorrorGaming,cwjrwe5,2,t5_2w4bb

5627237,0,t3_3s5wug,That review felt strongly of someone trying to point out all the cringey and generic parts of a play while still praising it enough to get sponsorship money. Basically he said it was really enjoyable but everything he gave actual detail to were complaints like sexy female lead or awkward electronic pop number.,HorrorGaming,cwum22q,2,t5_2w4bb

6727232,0,t1_d0ebh87,Never thought Id say this but Id rather not see any Lynch in this. So many things are drawing from Lynch and especially Twin Peaks its just getting stale. Edit typo,HorrorGaming,d0f5kku,1,t5_2w4bb

8147859,0,t3_4qt4c5,While this isnt exactly what you are talking about it is the same era and I felt it deserves a mention.      One of the first computer games I ever played was Dungeons of Daggorath It wasnt really focused on being scary however did have a great tension to it due to a few factors.      First your life meter was represented by a beating heart that sped up if you were close to dying.    Second monsters made sounds whe they moved and listening for them was one of the main ways you kept track of what was nearby.    Third you needed to use torches to see. You had a very limited number of them and if you ran out you were just screwed. As a result you were on a pretty strict time limit.  ,HorrorGaming,d4w12if,1,t5_2w4bb
9252930,0,t1_d8ob1zw,The number on thing I loved about this whole thing is instead of the horror being mostly physical i.e. you are physically about to be mauled by animatronics but you are not interacting with the animatronics on a personal level but with the revelation that these are sentient ais that you are shocking really bores down to an existential horror that I absolutely love.,HorrorGaming,d8ovjb2,2,t5_2w4bb
