1487909,0,t3_2b7sg9,For the first question what type of team are you hoping to support? do you want a team that is in a good area? has a lot of moneysupporters? has top quality players? play exciting football? have players from a certain country? etc.For the second question I would personally go to SaintEtienne  Reims. SaintEtienne are known for having one of the best fans in France and Europe so seeing them at home would be cool. The match would also probably be less one sided than Reims  PSG so more exciting for the neutral.On the other hand if PSG or Reims are teams you can see yourself supporting then I would go to see Reims at home. If you want to see the best individual footballers go to the PSG match they have the best squad in terms of quality and you might even get to see a David Luiz league debut.,Ligue1,cj2s8yj,3,t5_2sc3j
1529326,0,t1_cj7z2qy,Haha oh wowI think it could be argued the Lens jerseys redyellow black with redyellow are too similar to our home jersey redblack that they might have to use their rd jersey when they play usEeep,Ligue1,cj7z817,1,t5_2sc3j
2594712,0,t3_2pgc5p,Im depressed. Supporting Lens is tedious. Midway through a game Guillaume gives you something to smile about but then Touzghar comes on and rips that smile off your face with a brutal miss. Just when the pain starts to subside Richard Olivier drops in a friendly reminder you still owe him money and arent allowed to sign any players. Youre stuck with a bunch of players who despite being hardworking professionals arent good enough for Ligue . I turn around and look at Gervais Martel hoping hell say something encouraging. Hoping hell give me something to hold on to but nah nothing. The handsome old man repeats himself. Same shit different day. Its a never ending nightmare. Im sad. Chronically heartbroken. I have no one to turn to and Im very alone. Hold me. ,Ligue1,cmx9l02,3,t5_2sc3j

3487955,0,t1_cpptnay,Oui! Ce est a! Les boissons sont excellentes mais je ai trop bu chaque fois. Ma tte me fait mal quand je pense  Barberousse.Nonsense! Everybody needs European football. The financial difference between clubs is wider and wider every year. It is a big factor in attracting good players and keeping players. I hate watching football on Sundays but if it means more matches and attention from other footballers then so be it. Sanson will have two years after this season and that will be a critical time for player and team. Teams will be coming for him and this will be the best time for Montpellier to sell if they want the best deal. Montpellier better shove a new contract under his nose right now. A lot of attention for Mounier and I think he has one more year on his current contract so that is not good news for MHSC. If it gets really bad you might have to sign Remi Gaillard!ASSE has the same problems too. Hamouma has one more year on his contract and the team needs him. Hes been fantastic this season. Lemoine can leave on a free after this year. Many others have one year left but I think ASSE can get better players. The team desparately needs good strikers. Erding is not enough and van Wolfswinkel is only one loan. SaintMaximin signed a new contract but he is too young for the pressure now. But I think a big difference is Christophe Galtier. He has been fantastic with what he has to work with. Romeyer and Caiazzo dont want to give him any money.ASSE est dans une bonne position mais il est trs important que lquipe ne pense pas  lavenir. Juste un match  la fois. Lquipe est comme une vieille BMW qui est en concurrence avec les voitures de F. Ils ne peuvent pas gagner mais ils peuvent surprendre certaines personnes.,Ligue1,cppuon5,1,t5_2sc3j
3754712,0,t1_cqk7lfk,I dont think youre wrong. Playing against a man Lyon side you should definitely capitalize. Then again its away and ASSE is pretty much always gunshy playing at Stade de Gerland. I think Galtier was thinking a point was the minimum for that day and I think he was right even though I view it as two points lost. Fucking Jallet of all people...But I think Ruffier will come good after fucking up last week and the team knows that this is probably the last tough match of the season on paper. The good news for us and bad news for HSC is that the match is at Stade GeoffroyGuichard so the supporters will be rabid for this one. Im going to go for a  win but Im not underestimating HSC. I think it could be a  draw. Im going to go out on a limb and say a Clerc belter wins it.Loser buys the rounds for the night at Barberousse.,Ligue1,cqk9j4z,1,t5_2sc3j

6363236,0,t1_czcp6ac,I feel that Montpellier has such great youth development and club culture all they need is a coach with good club vision and they will be back near the top of Ligue ,Ligue1,czcxh1u,1,t5_2sc3j
6496640,0,t1_czppgf0,He wouldnt be the first guy to thrive under Bielsa and become a bit underwhelming afterwards  it happened with quite a lot of Bilbao players like Llorente or Muniain. Another example is Imbula. Apparently it was Bielsa who advised Labrune to sell him to Porto because he said hes already peaking i brought him here he wont get better than that. I hope Fekir will get back to his level. I especially hope that this year wasnt just a fluke like we saw so many in L. ,Ligue1,czratz5,1,t5_2sc3j

Mais napporte rien par rapport au tnor je pense  FotMob.Le fait de se concentrer sur la France peut tre une bonne chose et peut te permettre de tirer ton pingle du jeu. Tu devrais jouer  fond sur la France et proposer tout ce que tu peux en stats et donnes sur les championnats franais.,Ligue1,deeumnw,1,t5_2sc3j
