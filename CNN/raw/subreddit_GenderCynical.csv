2359966,0,t1_cm3cjwh,Why do you so often feel the need to insult my intelligence? Costello was talking about the trans communitys lack of concern about intersex. I was talking about how the trans community here on reddit while knowing who I am mostly ignores my work on intersex. How could Costello ever have heard of my work when I am for the most part a pariah in the trans community? It wouldnt make any sense for me to be upset at him. Its not his fault. Its the trans communitys fault for not paying attention to these important matters. What Im upset about is that he wouldnt have been able to make those criticisms if the trans community had been listening to me. If you want to talk about ignoring things try looking at what youve been ignoring. For example when I said that Costello was engaging in implicit transphobia it should be obvious from my other writings that his policing of trans peoples identities is what I was talking about. It isnt up to Costello or any other diagnosed intersex person to tell a trans person whether or not we are also intersex. Important researchers have argued that transsex is a form of intersex and as you should know that is something I consistently argue. I didnt ignore Costellos transphobia I simply chose to use my time last night to talk about the more important political issue of what transsex and other intersex people have in common  that is the denial of our informed consent and medical autonomy. ,GenderCynical,cm3ehud,-2,t5_32yl1

Were also talking about people who have given their problem and how to fix it much more thought than people who dont have it.It sounds as if youve wandered into a support group for such people and cissplained to them what they should be feeling andor doing as if youve given it more thought than them which is very unlikely to be the case.  If so they were right to call you out on it.This is kind of like someone wandering into a support group for depressed people and telling them they dont need SSRIs.  Its a simplistic opinion of someone whos never had to deal with the issue firsthand yet nevertheless thinks theyve had an original thought on the matter and thus can be this groups saviour.  Sorry but they cant.So it sounds like such people thought you might be a bigot and should go to a group for bigots which you then promptly joined that gets called out for being bigots.  If youre not a bigot then great but joining a hate group isnt a very good way to prove it.OK trusty gay analogy time.Lets say you stumbled across ractuallesbians and told them that you a straight woman I dont know if you are but lets assume so for the analogy have great news for them they dont need to have samesex partners!  They can be butch without having any of that icky gay sex and kissing.  What a relief they must feel!But oh no they dont like that idea.  It turns out they want to fall in love with someone the same sex.  This has nothing to do with being butch which many of them arent anyway.  Your straightsplaining was met with hostility.  It turns out theyve heard this idea before but rejected it long ago as being shall we say nave.Even worse theyre calling you a straight bigot and think youve come from some homophobic subreddit that was set up to harass them.  Now you know youre not a bigot and that youve been falsely accused but no one believes you.So you go to the antigay subreddit they told you about.  There you meet a whole bunch of straight people who sympathise with you.  These gay people are hostile they say.  Thats just what gay people are like.  They know youre not a bigot.  They get called that too!Can you see with this analogy how you might not be doing much to dissuade people in a minority group of the notion that youre engaging in bigoted behaviour?Anyway noone wants to annoy you.  This is just a bunch of LGBT people in this case trans people who want to vent about the cis people harassing them.

Certainly. . That doesnt mean youre not simultaneously part of another group with problems in this case having dysphoria  a black man is still a man and there are privileges there but he also struggles with racism. Privilege and oppression based on different elements of who you are can coexist. There is a strong GC feeling from what Ive read and encountered that since transwoman can choose if theyd like to go back to presenting as men there is privilege in that choice of being able to opt out of presenting as a member of a struggling group in this case trans. Also though internally they may not have felt their gender was accurate any trans person did get treated as their presenting gender before their transition which comes with its own privileges that cant be merely shookoff by transitioning.

You have several replies pointing out that sex can take place while at least partially clothed but no one has bothered to point out lingerie is a thing. There is clothing that exists specifically for fuckin in.But the real rub is the implication that your partners gender identity plays no role in the bedroom. So I had this roommate who transitioned. Not long after he did his girlfriend broke up with him. Shes a gay woman and she didnt want to be with a man. He hadnt started HRT or had any surgeries yet he was anatomically and personally identical to who he was before he switched pronouns but she just couldnt be with him anymore.

In other words Im pretty sure all LGBT people have too few rights according to liberal newspapers and too many rights according to conservative ones but if theyre only reading about gay people in liberal newspapers and only reading about trans people in conservative newspapers that might explain their confusion.That and they seem to believe all the articles that pretend trans people are all straight and equivalent to being super gay cis people an oversimplification thats essentially completely wrong thats dumbed down for cishet people.,GenderCynical,dbf558b,9,t5_32yl1

11438535,0,t1_dfselpt,also lololgt Yesterday the women of WoLF were accused of not liking or supporting women who werent in their Pacific Northwest clique today theyre accused of not liking or supporting detransitioned women...a pattern has emerged that speaks more to the accusers than the accused. Yes it speaks well of anyone who realizes WoLF is a pile of turds masquerading as feminists. ,GenderCynical,dfsjpf7,7,t5_32yl1
11439963,0,t3_63b181,I knew right away that is a Matt Walsh quote. This guy is a homophobic climate change denier who gives dangerous misinformation about late term abortions.He also believes Ivanka Trump is a leftist and that Beyonce is literally a Communist stripper for some reason.A broken clock is right twice a day!! Terfs use this expression a million times per thread in reference to horrible people. They are so dumb that they dont understand that expression only makes sense if you use it infrequently. Otherwise like its alot more than twice a day...,GenderCynical,dfspjik,22,t5_32yl1

11623926,0,t1_dgdjmbb,It really is amazing how they can take an important and useful concept  gender socialization  and make it so blackandwhite and essentializing so as to basically arrive at intrinsic traditional sexism. They say its not biology its socialization but their version of socialization is that all girls go through the exact same socialization while all boys go through another universal socialization and there is no nuance or variation and nobody can ever grow out of it and the end result is that you can assume what somebody thinks wants and acts like based entirely on their sex. Which is as we all know sexism. It allows them to get away with being biological essentialists without admitting to it. It allows them them to dismiss things that trans women say with Ugh thats so typically male and somehow not realize theyre being straightup sexist. They would flip a fucking lid if I responded to one of their heartfelt comments with Ugh thats so typically female. ,GenderCynical,dgdl0md,18,t5_32yl1

11802567,0,t3_68cfo9,The first one doesnt even make sense. Obviously only Russell Wilson can be Russell Wilson. Is she trying to suggest trans women are going around claiming to be specific cis women that they arent? Like is some trans woman out there claiming to be Beyonce?    But yeah I suggest finding a better hobby. ,GenderCynical,dgxv1gs,11,t5_32yl1
