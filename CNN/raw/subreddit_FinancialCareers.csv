83653,0,t3_1v1gnz,In my experience at least for roles at banks or well known accountancy firms youre unlikely to be considered if youve not graduated from a Russell Group university with a numerate degree  especially for graduate level jobs. All their job postings are massively over subscribed so they can afford to be as picky as they like and I reckon I could do it is rarely going to win over a track record of being able to do it.Not withstanding that it also sounds like your friend doesnt really understand what he wants to be doing. Working for a bank is a world away from working for accountancy firm which is world away from being a financial officer in a job that doesnt need a degree  and none of those easily transfer to any of the others. Finance is hugely broad field with a lot of different skill sets  unless you narrow your focus to say I want to work in MampA or I want to be a trader or I want to be a back office developer youre not going to pick up enough of the knowledge or skills that an employer would want.,FinancialCareers,cenyawg,4,t5_2scvl

1552494,0,t3_2c0y37,Whether you are sending off applications for jobs interviewing or have just lost a potential job like yourself  dealing with rejection can be hard to take its not only inevitable in life but its important in teaching you a skill that will be really powerful.Firstly Its not about you  Its hard but you cant take it personally. The final decision is seldom based on what you said or did assuming of course you did the required amount asked for which you did! There could have always been an internal candidate in the running for the role someone with more relevant experience or someone with experience they hadnt expected.   Get useful feedback  Dont sit there assuming you did something wrong. Seek out useful feedback if you can get it. Dont expect to get the full truth back always recruiters can only tell you what theyve been told and direct hirers have no responsibility to give you any reasons. Be honest with yourself but if the feedback doesnt make sense to you then be sure to ignore it and not let it get you down. Approach each application or interview with a fresh perspective. Be open to new industries and different roles where you could use your skills. Continually tailor your CV and cover letter as you gain more experience and learn from any mistakes so you can avoid making them again. Dont talk about past rejections at interview stay positive and upbeat even if its not how you are feeling. No one wants to employ a misery so give yourself the best chance by focusing on being enthusiastic and on what you have to offer.Handling rejection with a positive attitude can be easier said than done but know that if you give up youve got no chance and if you didnt get a job you wanted chances are it wasnt the right one for you anyway.  Dont be so hard on yourself. If the job the people and the company are right for you then the work wont seem like work at all and you will excel. getrealcareers.com,FinancialCareers,cjavmvl,-3,t5_2scvl

Since you are so far from the test its not exactly what you are looking for but you can download the Learning Outcome Statements from the CFA website and target them specifically either through a course or just free materials online. Like for quantitative methods you will need basic time value of money math and some basic statistics both of which you can get in courses or simply look up free materials directly relevant to the learning outcome statements. Any single book or source is most likely only going to be relevant to a small portion of the CFA curriculum which has considerable breadth  unless its designed specifically for the CFA curriculum.Also Investopedia has a free CFA I guide its not terribly thorough but should provide a good overview.,FinancialCareers,cxg5r4e,3,t5_2scvl

A bank is never going to higher someone with an undergrad in economics to actually be an economist. Most of the economists Ive met who work at banks have published papers maybe even spent some time working high up in the government or a big think tank. They will spend most of their time either providing color on the world to both the banks internal teams or meeting with the banks clients to share their view points.As an undergrad studying economics though you have an opportunity to work in several other roles in the bank such as Research which you mention. A research analyst generally works on a team dedicated to a specific sector or market. For example you could be hired to work on an emerging markets credit desk consumer products tech etc. Different banks will structure their research departments differently.

Did they have to do anything at all to my account over the last howevermany years?  No they gave no advice and executed no trades except doing a DRIP.

Ultimately I want to be a planner so I could offer feeonly advice.  I currently am a partner in a small firm with  other planners with staff to help with client services and admin. The most difficult aspect of the job now is the industry itself.  It used to be finding clients but after this many years i have a good client base and have become very referrable.  The Industry is changing and will contine to change.  Thats the main reason i wanted to be able to perform feebased planning giving clients advice on savings debt management pensions social security medicare etc.  Not just trying to get them roll over money or buy some kind of insurance.  The other hacks in the industry make it hard for the rest of us.

9307197,0,t1_d8vp95b,Was replying in the context of traditional sellside IB ie MampA coverage and capital markets products not ER research sits independent of typical sellside coverage.The issue with lateraling into traditional sellside IB as an Analyst is that the programs are extremely structured and formalized from both recruiting and the actual job. The goal is to properly fill the FOLLOWING years class out of summer internship recruiting. Because Analyst programs are structured as two year programs its easy to understand staffing needs pretty far out. Only time that changes is of theres a huge inflow of MampA volume or theres specific group needs ie its a small group and Analyst leaves early and they need to fill a spot.For those groups you can usually hire from lateral Analysts from other shopa who are looking to move up to a better firm ie theyre at a really small MM boutique and want to go to a BB or elite boutique. They want to move up because recruiting for the good PE and HF shops is from the better firms. Those kids have also already been though training which for the Analyst job really is huge. The only reason youd hire outside the industry is if theres a serious hiring crunch from deal volume and you have IMMEDIATE needs like the industry had two years ago.From there you typically want people who are younger who missed banking out of college and have focused on lateraling from day  of their first job. It shows they really want to get into it and just happened to miss their chance. If youve been working for a few years though youre likely too old and it shows you werent as focused in what you wanted. Remember its EXTREMELY competitive so they want people who are top of their stuff.The fact you have an accounting background going into an Analyst role usually doesnt mean much. Youre gonna a be taught everything on the job anyways.You could try going to a small regional MM boutique but exit ops at those shops arent nearly as good since sponsor recruiting is also highly formalized. Valuation consulting work on the other can be relevant because its about building operating models and presentations which is a large part of the Analyst role.If youre  years in youd be better off getting an MBA and getting in as an Associate where theyll give you credit for youre accounting experience since its more relevant to the role. But recruiting to sponsors out of an Associate position is very hard. Tldr everything is super structured its extremely competitive  years out is too old because it shows poor signaling  the expectation is what that much experience you get an MBA and come in as an Associate instead of lateraling. You just kind of missed your window is all...,FinancialCareers,d8vr5z9,2,t5_2scvl

Keep rolling the dice keep reaching out to people keep offering your availability you never know. Even saying youll do a small project for free or want to shadow them for a day could be an opening.I did loads of interviews before I got my first trading job and when I was a trader I had random people reach out to me directly who I ended up interviewing.

Then get your ass into a CC or a  year state school. If you can get  years of solid grades under your belt . gpa amp some decent extracurriculars  this shouldnt be too difficult your HS stats will become less relevant. If you have more than  units at a college USC doesnt even look at your HS grades or test scores when you apply as a transfer. By doing everything above and writing about your medical situation in highschoolhow you pulled yourself back up in the applications and backing it up with good grades this should guarantee you admission to USC.

Takes mo to  yrs depending on the school. Look for an AACSB school technically better MBA for international business recognized by Fortune  amp allows for better mobility among countriesIf you want to advance your direct career fastest nonmanagement in Finance the MSF will take  year amp potentially offer the most mobility vs  increase. Regarding the CFA amp CPA they are similar but different. I would research both to determine what suits your future aspirations in the short term as each offers benefits depending on the industry subset. They would both benefit you well bc theyre the gold standard of the industry for being certified both highly regarded in various circles. You also need to do your research on target employers. You may choose one path based on what you think you need but their positioning may require something different. ,FinancialCareers,dbhabua,2,t5_2scvl

10723072,0,t1_ddlw3sy,I mean that I cannot tell you. Im not from the US so probably dont appreciate the process enough to be able to offer advice. In the uk business schools are pretty open to a range of experience as long as the story is compelling. How small is the company? I personally know two people who got into m schools. One from a ratings agency and one from a much more entrepreneurial background. As long as the am firm isnt like a boiler room type place youre learning and developing and in the right way I dont see why not. But even if not business school. Just moving into a bigger firm one day will open up a lot of opportunities.One thing I do like to tell people around your age group is that always remember to keep your options open. I presume you wont be starting until post graduation? If you see something you like job wise send an application. This not immoral its keeping your options open. Maybe just make sure you arent applying to jobs run by your offers next door neighbours. Its worth remembering that any firm that goes through a period of stress wont hesitate to rescind your offer. I remember many moons ago when I was starting a role as an analyst at a relatively large bank  of the global markets intake has their offers rescinded two weeks before their start date. So it does happen Youre young enough where as long as you a learning good stuff and developing and acquiring new skills I dont really think that there is a wrong choice. Lots of people your age become fixated on for example tmt coverage and are so inflexible. When the truth is there are probably hundreds of jobs that will be better suited to the individual. Its a wide world out their with countless opportunities. When i was your age I was more concerned with travelling than work so youre already streets ahead of where I was.Dont stress it youll get to where you want to be. ,FinancialCareers,ddm07ej,1,t5_2scvl
