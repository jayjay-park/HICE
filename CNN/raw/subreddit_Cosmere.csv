We dont know quite what caused it but Atium is formed by a sort of leakage of Ruins power from the Pool below the Pits with the Atium geodes somehow concentrating this power into physical form. Lerasium on the other hand doesnt appear to be generated this way when the Lord Ruler ascended he gave some to nobles leaving two beads at the Well Hoid took one and Elend took the last. There is no mention in the thousand years since the Lord Rulers ascension that new Lerasium was formed  Would be awesome though! ,Cosmere,d9hxpsg,1,t5_2t7vi
9527708,0,t1_d9natql,Just noticed the thread is no spoilers and my response has plot spoilers for Stormlight and Hero of Ages so tagging.First the annotation notes that he spun the religion off into its own book could be interpreted as saying he wanted to give more background on where that religion came from especially with the note that its a different planet implying there is some connection more than inspiration. I think thats a more strained interpretation but certainly enough for me to say the annotation isnt proof that the religions are not connected.The other religions give pretty strong evidence in favor of a connection though. The Bennet have a very rigid hierarchy and believe they worship their god with detailed maps both things that align with the Dominion shard.Alls Canzi works for Rosharpossibly Odium specifically but thats a bit less clear. They studied anatomy which would make sense for a world where investiture changes you. Fabrials affect the priests who use them Knights Radiant become lighteyes etc. And plot wise a main character spent his childhood studying anatomy so it would work well to have that knowledge matter later on. Plus Sazed dismisses the religion for teaching that spirits can choose their own body but the evil are punished with a bad body. This could be explained as a warped memory of Parshendi taking forms with different spren and Odium spren hijacking them.Alls Larsta is pulled pretty cleanly from an unpublished book but Ruin was also adapted from that book so Id put it in the same category as the religion pitched to Clubs since it could just be repurposed.Another religion worships animals this could fit with the Sixth of the Dusk world but theres not nearly enough detail there to say anything for sure.Alls Add in that Trell is confirmed to be Cosmere influenced and from Taldain completing a set of religions from every Cosmere world weve seenother than the Forests of Hell which is confirmed to not have a shard it seems much simpler to say that all the religions are Cosmere influenced than to say that one is and the others just all coincidentally can be mapped to other worlds.,Cosmere,d9nhpcx,2,t5_2t7vi

10168764,0,t3_5li5yl,Warning Spoilers below for Warbreaker The Stormlight Archive Mistborn Era  and Secret History.Nalthis The Returned are Cognitive Shadows firmly attached to their bodies by their divine Breath.gtAlso the Returned on Nalthis are cognitive shadows shoved into and firmly attached to their dead bodies by virtue of that enormous divine Breath theyre given.Roshar Some would call Heralds Cognitive Shadows.gtThe Heralds are tied to the system by the magic that permeates them. ... Some would call them Cognitive Shadows right? Whether they are or not. Cognitive Shadow is a very ambiguous term in the Cosmere. It means basically your soul Investiture replaced your soul and permeated your soul and your soul continues to exist but you are usually Invested with something thats tied and youre basically like pure Investiture then. Youre tied to the thing youre Connected to.I think these two are the best WoBs in this list for two reasons. Confirms how Returned definitely and Heralds less definitely exist. If Im reading this correctly their Cognitive Shadow or something else in the case of the Heralds has been tethered to their body via Investiture which essentially grants them immortality.. Possibly confirms how Kelsier was able to gain access to the Physical Realm. However Im curious how he would have procured enough Investiture without the assistance of Harmony assuming Harmony wasnt involved. It makes me wonder if he took a more nefarious route to Invest himself.,Cosmere,dbwooir,5,t5_2t7vi
10206829,0,t3_5m4xe5,What if... Okay so before Adonalsium was shattered what kinds of Investiture did anyone have if any? None? Maybe? Surely some kind of direct Adonalsiumtype Investiture as current shardworlds have Investiture based on the Shards or splinters that settled there right?So... What if all that existed when Adonalsium was around was the Physical Realm? What if along with all the Shards being created upon the Shattering of Adonalsium that also created the Cognitive and Spiritual Realms? So the Cognitive Realm is in essence just Adonalsiums Cognitive Shadow or whats left of it?You can only access the Cognitive Realm using some form of Investiture right? So it makes sense that itd be connected to this maybe? And since Adonalsium is literally the power of creation and his Shattering created Shards why not something to continue to kind of... Connect those Shards together?So the Physical Realm has the Physical Body or Shards of Adonalsium. The Cognitive Realm is the dead Cognitive Shadow of Adonalsium and the Spiritual Realm is... I guess the... I want to say shell but not physical shell like think of the Shards as segments of a fruit like an orange or mandarin for example. You take the segments out and it leaves a skin which you could conceivably put the segments back into. But in this analogy the fruit segments are the shards and physical and the skin is like the framework of Adonalsium or the soulskeleton. Id say if anything this would contain or maybe even be whats left of his Identity. The Shards draw most of their power from the Spiritual Realm and they can use it to see through time and space to what other Shards are up to so it shows an intrinsic connection and connection is very important in the Cosmere.Just throwing some crazy things out there Im not that wellversed in Cosmere theoryland really I just read the books. So I could be properly debunked in like three seconds. But its cool to think about. Shattering the POWER OF CREATION would surely make or fuck up more things than just creating a bunch of Shards right?,Cosmere,dc101o4,9,t5_2t7vi

10608160,0,t1_dda518v,Elantris the book takes place quite early in the Cosmere timeline as I recall so by the time of Secret History theyve likely advanced a fair deal. Beyond that the requirements to travel to the cognitive realm are much simpler than traveling by space. Elantris in particular has an easily accessible Shard Pool even if we know that travel in Sels cognitive realm is dangerous. We also know that Threnody is important to the Cosmere as a whole somehow but not how. I think that exploring just around your own planet likely wont cause too much grief in the Cognitive world but Era  Scadrians might mess things up a bit once they start exploring all of space. On the other hand space itself might not expand much because people wont be thinking about each place just the planets and interesting bodies.,Cosmere,dda5f8s,8,t5_2t7vi

10925555,0,t1_de0sc2o,I have to disagree with this almost completely. As you say most cocky people irl are jerks but that does not preclude there from being people who are exactly like Kelsier.Depression does sap the will to live from a person it almost did to Kaladin. But people who actually stop letting their depression spiral down are not uncommon. I have personally experienced the turn around point that Kaladin did and it was not comfortable to walk that path again with Kaladin.There are millions of people who are strong capable people who have no idea of their own abilities of worth in the real world. Most of these people do not overcompensate by showing off.What Sandersons characters are are the people who are broken but DONT let their failings bring them down. Every one of these examples exist in real life you just rarely hear about a heros failings and you rarely hear about a Jerks accomplishments.If anything your examples are stereotypes of the problems people with these issues face but the reality is that humanity is so diverse that Kelsier Kaladin Vin Shallan and ALL of them are actually just reflections of ourselves telling us what we CAN be if we dont give in to our own flaws.,Cosmere,de6w7wx,2,t5_2t7vi
