9359079,0,t1_d928wxj,trying to make an extremely cheap wifi display tablet meant they couldnt give it the full components they needed while keeping the price point down. When the display already eats up most of the battery anyway having a much stronger but more expensive battery in the switch makes sense when youre not selling a tommanufacture tablet on top of your fully powered console. The technology largely already existed when they released the wii u albeit with worse graphics but making the controller up to the specs of a full blown tablet would have made the wii u cost now when the tablet is the full console and the dock is nothing but the power supply and HDMI port that gives you tons of room to work with upgrading the architecture of the tablet and the mobile technology has been refined to give it a very possible  hour lifespan though  is still probably more likely at a  price point,NintendoSwitch,d92bx77,1,t5_3h47q

9374785,0,t1_d94ayqc,gt Two modes is nothing compared to the PC gaming environmentI never compared it as such.gt I just imagine it being p portable and p docked andor higher framerates. Thats achievable by clocking the CPU and GPU higher when docked which would be doable with cooling and mains power.I dont think this is very feasible not only does changing clocks based on environment have possible consequences for hardware stability it also means that the games need to be able to actively switch between the two modes on the fly which I shouldnt need to explain why thats a terrible idea.gt theyre doing something similar with PS proXbox Scorpio.This is completely different to PS ProXbone Scorpio because its not MANDATORY and if the NDS has told us anything about something being optional it means that it will be rarely utilised even for first party titles.This would need to be required for all games made for it as I highly doubt that the developers would be given the option to disable the switch due to the way hardware works as far as I know the only console that has ever given the developer the ability to change the clock speed was late PSP games even then Im not sure if it was only first party games.,NintendoSwitch,d94bjm8,-2,t5_3h47q

9390706,0,t1_d95hbhd,I disagree. There are definitely two seperate genres within the D Mario space Collectathons like SM and D Mario games in D like D World.In SM and Sunshine you have a large hub world with areas that you transport to that have a large number of unique goals though there are repeated themes like collecting red coins. Completing enough of these goals unlocks new areas and new levels that you can progress through in order to eventually beat the game.In D World and D Land you play a bunch of linear D maps where your goal is the flag post or a boss. You have things you can collect on the way that might unlock things but in general your goal is to get to the end of one level then do the next.The Galaxy series imo blurs the line a bit in that you have multiple missions on the same level but there are usually less per level and there are a lot of levels that just have a path that after it branches is unique to that star. So it plays somewhat like SMSunshine while being a bit more linear like D WorldLand would come to be.So yes while they are all D Mario games itd be like comparing Zelda II to Zelda  they are just completely different even though they are both D Zelda games.,NintendoSwitch,d96c7bm,1,t5_3h47q

Even games like Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword felt too guided compared to the older games which offered more opportunity to explore at your own pace and stumble across secrets out of order. Though iirc the original game didnt want you to explore the temples out of order. There was a warning in the instruction booklet that completing the dungeons out of order may cause an inconsistent save state that would ruin your file. Disregard that statement.

9463750,0,t3_5aacbb,When I loaded up the Sun and Moon demo I thought the overworld style was a terrible design.  Everything was too far away from the camera and detail was awful.  You could tell the models and textures were high quality but were rendered horribly like the screen was too small or the gpu wasnt strong enough.  The previous generation was absolutely gorgeous and this just didnt match up.Then I saw the Switch trailer and it started to make sense.  A bigger screen and a more powerful gpu with greater resolution and all of those art assets would look how they were intended to.  At some point in development Sun amp Moon were either targeted for the Switch or started using assets from a game that was.  Or perhaps was targeted for the ds but as a stepping stone for the next title which will be a Switch game.I dont think it will be an mmo though.  Maybe some sort of area where people can interact online through more than just menus like the wireless room of rd gen or the mining in th gen but not main game.  ,NintendoSwitch,d9flhzm,1,t5_3h47q
9463779,0,t3_5addlb,Regardless of whoever said it since everyone else has that covered its very realistic for a portable device being made by Nintendo for cheap. More RAM  more battery drain  more cost. Its very likely that Nintendo may have chosen to go with less RAM so they didnt have to spend more on RAM and a bigger battery.

Nintendo could easily keep pushing out yearly Nintendo titles on the system if they decided to go in that direction.Regardless I think Im just going to trade in my DS.

9536392,0,t1_d9ltr1h,I honestly cant say for sure since I dont have that much experience with ARM all games Ive worked on so far have been for either an x or a PowerPC system and since Ive also mainly worked on other things than low level engine stuff so far. My guess is that those things are mainly dependent on other factors. Factors like RAM available memory bandwidth to load resources on the fly and also GPU speed of course.Im not really worried though. If developers put in the effort they can definitely make it happen. I mean Wii U had Xenoblade Chronicles X and that was quite an epic and open game already. Its rarely a matter of raw specs anyways. Its usually a matter of how much time you can invest and how many compromises you are willing to make. Basically if Xenoblade Chronicles could run on the New DS in D with a very stable  FPS Im sure The Witcher  or GTA could run on the Switch with enough time.,NintendoSwitch,d9ok566,1,t5_3h47q

9563448,0,t1_d9r749z,I agree with you but nah fam. The Cstick dilemma is still there. Intact with the button layout on the gamecube the tiny nub of the cstick allows for swift directional input for aerials for example. Or in the case of melee a waveshine to smash. Try throwing out a SHFF dair on a pro controller compared to a gamecube controller. The gamecube controller also allows for a clawgrip to utilize  buttons with one finger. and yeah hopefully nintendo allows the adapter to be compatible. I play on my ds and its horrendous but its the best I can do when its portable smash.  The reason the gamecube controller is better than others is because of its design that allows more possibilities. the directional edges of the sticks and button layout is the best on a competitive level. Ive played PM and melee on my computer with an xbox controller for a very long time I even tried the dualshock  but after not having played with a GC controller for so many years it was the most comfortable once I picked it up. it boils down to preferences yes but a GC joycon is going to sell. its going to sell whether you like it or not. Ill definitely buy one. regular joycons arent difficult to carry around as theyre small and compact. If the gc joycon doesnt have analog triggers or the ergonomical shape and button layout its useless and wont serve any purpose. ,NintendoSwitch,d9rw2w9,1,t5_3h47q

9686678,0,t1_da7149e,Alright Ill answer this as Animal Crossing is my favorite gameseries of all time.So Ill start off by saying that the game is definitely not for everyone. It is quite a polarizing game simply for the fact that there really is no linear plot or objective. You create a town and you basically live there with your animal neighbors thats the game. You can catch bugs fish find fossils collect furniture decorate your house theres no one telling you how to play the game or in what way is right to play.The game goes by realworld time so stores close at night and open in the morning and theres events for some of the bigger days like Christmas Thanksgiving etc.I love AC because it is an escape from the fastmoving pace of real life. I have severe depression and anxiety and for me this game is probably the most therapeutic thing Ive come across. You grow attached to your neighbors and you dont have to worry about anything besides just being happy. I would definitely recommend watching some YouTube videos about it but ultimately theres nothing quite like experiencing the game for yourself.,NintendoSwitch,da736vj,10,t5_3h47q

The game is alright it isnt the game play I hate it is the story. And people just downvoted me for trying to give an opposite opinion in rgames or rgaming whichever it was.People may want old games but leave them to emulation or something like that. Let them be in the original format that we know and loved them on. Dont waste time redoing classic games when there is no reason to today.

9705933,0,t3_5e3o6k,I have to agree with uIamNickJones comment that India is not a profitable market for Nintendo. Just look around it is really hard to find Wii U and DS. I personally never knew anyone who own those devices. Their price at Amazon and Flipkart is way more than a modest smartphone. Add to that the cost of individual games. A middle class person in this situation would rather go for a PC or a smartphone which provides him with access to tons of freepirated games along with additional features. PS and Xbox also never got the same traction in India compared to Western world. Thing is majority of users who are interested in the games do not have the monetary resources hence the rampant piracy.Also India never had the gaming culture. NES never came here. Few years ago i found out that the only gaming system i had which i thought was NES was a cheap Chinese knockoff. I can bet hardly anyone knows about SNES Gamecube and N as well.

9769339,0,t1_dah9shp,While I agree with you that it is a relatively foreign concept to game consoles it isnt really impractical to do for the first time.

9770792,0,t1_dahglcr,Im an older gamer and had every Nintendo home console and anyone that thinks Nintendo have never been about power is very wrong. The late Satoru Iwata changed that strategy to a more casual higher software output model which in turn made the games slightly less AAA than they used to be. The NES was the most powerful console of its generation so was the Super NES the Nintendo  and even the gamecube was more powerful than the ps and xbox. Nintendo have only had weaker consoles with the wii and wii u home consoles which were Iwata consoles so anyone that thinks Nintendo has never been about power does not know their Nintendo history. ,NintendoSwitch,dahgsor,11,t5_3h47q
9772710,0,t1_dahl55o,gt  The second screen is just too integral.EO plays fine on a phone. Maybe the Switch could be turned sideways. The screen is so much bigger than the DS that it could easily fit the gameplay and the map together.,NintendoSwitch,dahpb63,2,t5_3h47q
9772900,0,t3_5f3wvl,They really need to focus on building value and marketing. The price point and bundling are going to play a large part in how well this device sells. If it has a must play game or killer app right out of the gate then it will sell. If theres nothing to play on the device for a year you can forget it. It should be be noted that Mario or Zelda isnt enough for everybody. On the other hand you cant expect even the best of consoles to sell if nobody is talking about it. It wouldnt be the first time Nintendo has stepped on their own toes when it comes to marketing a console. I know that a lot of us are psyched about the Switch but some of my  relatives have expressed the opposite. They were burned on the Wii U and now have a bad taste in their mouth. These are adults who have children.The announcement video appealed to adult gamers without children. The distinct lack of children in the video may have struck the wrong chord with some parents who may have a desire to connect with their children through gaming. Its really hard to say how that will play out.Thats my opinion anyway I used to work in directresponse marketing and hitting the right marketing angle would double my sales some months and kill them entirely on others. I dont imagine that selling consoles is all that different from selling anything else. If you hit the right angle you get the sale. If you dont no unique feature will help you in the slightest. ,NintendoSwitch,dahq5ij,2,t5_3h47q

9849447,0,t1_dardwso,I wouldnt hold out on buying Destiny.  The sequel looks like it will be coming to PC but the original? Nah.If FFXV is something that you want to play soon again dont hold out.  The devs have been asked about bringing it to PC and presently it is uncertain if they will at all and certain that if they do it will be a least a year or two before it happens.As far as World of FF and Dragon Quest Builders go cant help ya.Personally I really kinda hate that exclusives even are a thing at all.  I can tolerate it for st party games games that would not work without a specific input method like something designed specifically to be played with a mouse and keyboard or a Wiimote and games like Bayonetta  that wouldnt have happened without the support of a console manufacturer.  I can even understand not brining a game to specific platforms because porting costs are to high.  But in my opinion the less games are  made exclusive to individual consoles for no reason other than to increase the value of the console the healthier the industry as a whole will be.,NintendoSwitch,daremc9,0,t5_3h47q

9981450,0,t1_db8fpgu,gtOf course they could but Apple could have done that for a decade now.Switch is something new something different so you cant just say Apple could do that decade ago. Its not like Apple is know for their creativity andor innovation.gtAnd they target casuals as much as anyone.Why is this a problem? Apple made so many product from phone tablet and computer which targeting different audiences. Apple can just make a gaming phones just for gamers and not casuals. Gamers too need phone and whats better for gamers than a gaming phone?gtIf the Switch surpasses the Wii and sells  million it is still less than Apple.So? It still show the concept is solid practical and people do want it. And it may apply to Apple products as well. gtAs for android I think you prove why one phone may try but if you dont have the majority it will not truly take off. If Switch is a success there is a high chances it will take off. The success will show mobile company that a gaming phone complete with physical controller via buildinfull addon support can sell. It also will convince consumer that these type of phones is practical actually work so they will feel more comfortable to buy them. Dont forget touchscreen gaming actually originated from Nintendo DS smartphone copy it and now mobile gaming which is touchbased is a big thing.gtTake Sony it pushed into movies and games. But by not focusing on consumer electronics they actually lost a ton of consumersThese comparison isnt quite accurate to my point since mobile gaming is a thing. Gaming is not something new to mobile platform unlike Sony who try to jump into totally different path. Movies  electronics.Gaming is something familiar with mobile and I only suggesting these company could make a special kind of gaming phone to take advantage of games they have in Google Play and App Store.

The Wii U is also more powerful than the PS so again would make sense that the Switch will be regardless as Nintendo fans always claim during a current gen its not about power its about games however since were prelaunch everyone needs the Switch to be more powerful than the Pro and Scorpion...which it wont be. ,NintendoSwitch,dbczslh,1,t5_3h47q

10026151,0,t3_5j9hzc,Tbh sales mean much more than hardware. If the switch sells like hot cakes then you better believe that AAA devs will be lining up at the door to develop for the switch. If it doesnt sell well at launch then its doomed. AAA dev companies actually do want the switch to do well shocking I know. Why wouldnt they want a whole new console to sell on? The whole goal of running a business is to make money so if making games for the switch is profitable they will support it. The obvious counter argument is well the Wii sold a ton of units and it had no AAA support. I know that the Wii had awful AAA support but thats completely different. The Wii forced developers to change the fundamental aspects of their game. Pair that with a horrendously underpowered system and you get a recipe for disaster. The switch on the other hand just requires a port. We dont know if the switch is easy to port to or not but its already better for devs than the Wii. The bottom line is this if the switch sells well it will have AAA support even if its underpowered ,NintendoSwitch,dbefo9o,2,t5_3h47q

Wii U games freeze for miiverse block home entirely when online and Pokemon SunMoon disconnect from global wifi if you merely go to options Using this would give them some welltested support for a good networking stack and process scheduler pretty dang important.But unlike a proper Android setup you can run Linux pretty barebones and without some of the sacrifice speed for compatibility stuff Android does like JVM based software.

Its not a great platform and EA is a bit tooo into their client. Ultimately its a combination of factors. See that example your gave about crysis is just one story. Alot of other devs are fine with working with nintendo. In fact many were surprised at how open they were about content e.g. Platinum games. Other factors include sales which is the main thing.

I cannot say that I understand it but I read something about it.  I think psvr screen has  subpixels per something vs the vive and oculus which has  per something.I am talking about things I have no understanding of and I usually pride myself on knowing what I am talking about.  Let me know if Im wrong.  Edit Heres a post submitted  months ago by uwasiaFuse on the oculus sub.I dont get why they put so little attention to display technology differencePSVR is a RGB display so it means  subpixel per resolution pixelRiftVive is a PenTile display so they got only  subpixel per pixelSo lets count subpixels!RiftVive xx  PSVR xx   actually  higher!So actually its both easier for PS hardware to render to PSVR AND its perceivable resolution is higher. That means better colors and clarity for PSVR. How much better? Without using all the units I cant tell you for sure but I think you could spot a difference,NintendoSwitch,dbruod3,2,t5_3h47q

10161256,0,t1_dbveu8q,Nintendo is one of the most covert closed companies in the industry. Quite a few developers for example didnt have a Switch dev kit until VERY recently that Unreal Engine  games Seasons of Heaven ?? is being developed for the Switch and the developer doesnt even have a dev kit yet. Game UK and many other retailers have preordersstore pages dedicated to games with a TBC release date. It is highly likely theyve seen all the marketing material from Nintendo and just assumed thats the date. I mean on the Game website theres been preorders for games that are never released e.g. Metro Last Light Wii U version where theyve gladly taken full payment for a product that doesnt exist let alone has a release date.,NintendoSwitch,dbvu2ch,1,t5_3h47q

Old versions mostly sold out it seems because they didnt make many and it never really took off or made a splash. If they were doing both chips itd be a short run of one chip and a large run of another. Probably wouldnt be that different. Itd be a difference theyd be willing to stomach if it were for Nintendo.

They arent exactly a huge company.

I often play my DS and will definitely be upgrading! It is so nice to have an excuse to play in peace  I already got some positive comments when I got the small white DS a while back so I imagine the Switch will have people curious and sneaking glances as well. Personally not too worried about cases since I always have a seat and my bag has nice pockets for things like tablets. I wont have a table to set it down on but thats not a problem with the Switch.

Rayman Legends was planned to be a Wii U exclusive but Ubisoft last minute decided that they wanted it to be on the other platforms so they delayed the game on the Wii Ueven though it was already finished so it could launch on other platforms alongside it.

10194822,0,t1_dbzkhla,I enjoyed it too but I would rather want for Mario and Nintendo to keep moving forward in the future instead of sequelizing existing games. This is what brought us Super Mario Galaxy instead of Super Mario Sunshine  not that SMS couldnt be great but Galaxy is like in my top  favourite games ever so yeah. This is especially the case this time around since D World already kinda was a sequel to D Land and those two came after Galaxy  that was even more linear than the first Galaxy which also already was more linear than the previous game Sunshine. It would be great finally to see a game that breaks that cycle.,NintendoSwitch,dbzn0o2,1,t5_3h47q
10194908,0,t3_5lzrvh,Alongside a second Switch I hope they also give us an option to connect DSs too. The asynchronous multiplayer of Four Swords Adventures and Crystal Chronicles I feel has not been fully explored. In lieu of connecting another Switch DSs might be more readily available.Heck Nintendo could really blow us out of the water and allow Android and iPhone to connect to the Switch. This is incredibly unlikely but you cant deny that it would make asynchronous multiplayer incredibly easy to set up since everyone has phones. Im imagining a Switch connectivity app on the play store and ios store that works kinda like download play.As a side note it would be really cool to get GCN VC games like Crystal Chronicles and Four Swords Adventures working on the Switch with functional asynchronous multiplayer.,NintendoSwitch,dbzndb4,1,t5_3h47q

Nintendo going third party would pit Zelda Mario Pokemon against things like Persona X Last of Us X Uncharted X Halo X so on and so on.  Before anyone says it  But the Nintendo games target a different demographic!  True but that doesnt mean people will just buy it anyway.  I for example would buy all of the above Except Halo I dont have an xbox but if those came out at similar times on the same system?  Id have a real hard time justifying that.  PC?  Id wait for steam sales for anything I didnt need in the now.  Nope I feel like Nintendo would just fizzle out like Sega did if they gave up hardware.  Would I love Nintendo games being cross platform? Absolutely. Cause I prefer buying games on PC.  But.... I dont want it at the cost of Nintendo becoming the next Sega.

10242794,0,t3_5mn6fx,Platformer games need some amount of linear design. If they were truly open world you could just go around all obstacles. The only way an openworld Mario would work is if there was a huge open world but with lots of portalspipesdoorwhatever leading to linear style levels. Basically take the hub weve seen in previous Mario games and expand it into a world of its own. That would actually be really cool IMO. You could start at the castle jumping into paintings expand the journey to Toad Town Delfino Island and various other familiar locations and maybe end the game on the space station shooting off into other galaxies. It would satisfy peoples craving for open environments and exploration while providing the linear gameplay that Mario games need. There could even be a few linear sections in the hub world connecting different sections as long as there are warp pipes to bypass them upon completion to avoid tedious backtracking. Though by doing that they may destroy the illusion of it actually being one big open world.,NintendoSwitch,dc52sz8,1,t5_3h47q

10247202,0,t1_dc5i1hv,Its powerful in the scope of handhelds.  Its not meant to give the ps and xbone a run for its money.  People compare it to those as a console but its not just a console its a hybrid.  Honestly I think itll sit in a good spot.  Let me give you an example power wise PCs blow PS and Xbone out of the water.  I own the Witcher  on both my PC and my PS.  My PC has a smoother time with it but honestly unless I compare them side by side I dont really notice that much of a difference between them.  The switch like going from PC to PS will probably be able to play the same games comparably but again unless you compare them directly you probably wont notice that much of a difference but all the same there will be a difference.  The idea here isnt for the Switch to be equal with the other two.  The idea is to have the opportunity to play these games wherever you are.  If you stay at home  and always have a tv to yourself the PS or Xbone is what you should get.  If you find yourself sharing your TV or traveling though?  The switch is very lucrative.

I know a lot of people who might be interested in VR but the cost of entry is waaaaay too high   for just the headset plus a  graphics card plus whatever other overhead you need for the GPU i.e. upgraded power supply new board in order to have available PCI slots etc.  Or for PSVR its a  headset  camera  Move controllers all on top of a PS Pro.

10322769,0,t3_5nsxfu,You know that stadium full of people in the original Switch commercial?  People were excited to see some professional Splatoon  action.  As unlikely as that was even if Nintendo did everything right theyre actively driving away the possibility that their multiplayer games will ever succeed.  Theres nothing Id love more than for some good competitive play on Splatoon  Smash  Switch and retro games updated with online play but lets take a look at how massively Nintendo has screwed this up.VoIP and party system are restricted to smart devicesTheres the tiny glimmer of hope that the Switch is considered a smart device in this context and that the console itself also has this app on it that allows you to invite friends and chat with them.  I say tiny because if it that was a real feature of this console the copy written about it wouldnt have led me to believe that its impossible to do on the console itself.  They know what they wrote and what they wrote sure sounds like its only going to be possible through an Android or iOS device.  I do not want to play Splatoon with my phone in my lap so that I can talk to my friends while I play online with them.  Thats a stupid thing to tell your customers to do when weve had a better way to do all of this as long ago as .You dont get to keep your complimentary game every monthThis one is ridiculous.  This means that Nintendo looked at PS and Xbox Live and intentionally chose to offer less value to its customers.  If you want to make a game free for a month and only that month just make it actually free.  Youre charging me for a blind box where the box disappears every month.  Thats terrible.No confirmation yet about whether or not purchases are tied to hardwareIt would be nice to have some good news about their online system to soften the blow of this other news but in their silence Ive got no recourse except to assume that purchases are still tied to hardware.  This means I need to present a police report to recover my games in some cases.  It means that I cant just log in on my friends system and play my gamesDLC while Im there.  It means that if nothing has changed on this front it is absolutely not worth buying downloadable games from Nintendo.  Thats before we even get to the part where I probably wont be able to sign in and have all of my previouslypurchased VC titles.Nintendo has the audacity to charge for online play on top of all of thisI dont think theyve announced pricing yet but a pretty safe bet is at least  a year.  If it all worked well and did what I expect of a modern product thats not a hard pill to swallow.  When you actively fight your player base on using the internet in the ways they want to its hard to imagine that many people are going to be online playing Splatoon  with no voice chat and a mandatory subscription fee to get online.The only thing about the Switchs online capabilities that seem like they were designed by a modern hardwaresoftware company is the parental controls app.  Just put a big logo on the bottom corner that says Hey parents scan this QR code to get our parental controls app! and that seems like a handy thing that gives parents all the control theyd want in a modern intuitive way.  Theres nothing intuitive about anything else above and its ridiculous that this is the third Nintendo console thats going to be so far behind every other online gaming network.,NintendoSwitch,dce55bv,5,t5_3h47q

10323278,0,t1_dce2u7t,I cant really explain it. I bought a  controller for the PC too so control wasnt the problem. I just cant get comfortable on it. I love keeping things simple and having  machine devoted to games and knowing that every game released on this machine will work  of the time with no need to change settings. Ill put it this way my greatest joy in videogames now is probably to sit and play my old GBA or GameCube or PS or a NES Mini. Its not nostalgia goggles. Its because theyre simple and straightforward and have ceased production. They are a finished product and cannot change. Lets say I own  games on Gamecube. I know what my options are. I can touch and feel my physical collection. I feel present and inthemoment when playing it. No achievements no notifications no online no gimmicks no motion controls. Just you the controller and the game. Squeezing every last drop out of the game because thats all you have. Pure blissful simplicity!With PC gaming my mind feels too scattered. I can play this game or that game but then Im missing out on X Y Z. Feels like Im always chasing my tail. Cant relax. Theres too much noise going on. Im not in control or present. Feel like Im just renting the games and consuming too fast. Gotta move fast because theres always a new game coming.

10325922,0,t3_5nsxfu,The game line up is bad. Aside from Zelda and possibly Mario none of the  games lineup look interesting. Theres literally only  games so far that I think most people are really itching to play and one of them doesnt come out for another    months. Absolutely abysmal launch lineup and nothing going for it throughout the year aside for maybe a Mario Kart port and a new Mario game. Didnt the Wii U suffer from the exact same lack of library?The price is bad... USD is too much. I understand why its that expensive but I dont think its justified. For example do we really need HD Rumble driving up the price? Especially when itll probably be woefully underused and not implemented in  percent of games. Again the Wii U could have been cheaper if it had not been for the gamepad screen which wasnt used to its full potential. Mostly useless and nonnecessary features driving up price. Nintendo once again shows use that instead of trying to keep up with modern video game specs they much prefer to add in gimmicks and skirt by on nostalgia.I was so so hyped for this console. I loved my DS and while I didnt particularly enjoy the Wii and I never bought a Wii U I was excited to play Nintendo games on an up to par console once again.I would have preordered it if it had good games even if the price was expensive.I would have preordered it if it was cheap even if the game lineup wasnt that great.And I would have preordered it if it had neither of those things but at least was as capable as modern consoles like the Xbox One and PS.But its none of those things. Its got no games its too expensive and its nowhere near as good as other consoles.It literally has nothing going for it besides Zelda.Sorry Nintendo Im not buying this.I think this is going to be Nintendos last home console.

I work in a computer repair shop and I can say Ive seen significantly more failed desktop laptop and external WD drives than Seagate equivalents.But just as well youd hear someone say the exact same thing with the brands reversed in a different city.Ultimately its just a matter of preference. They both ship thousands upon thousands of good drives but both still have the same risk that any HDD can have its life cut short before the guy next to you.In other words buy an external SSD instead. More reliable way faster way lighter and therefore more portable.

10342449,0,t3_5o3knd,I cant really answer the technical questions on this but thought Id chime in on the aspect of going digital.I decided to go fully digital when I bought my Xbox One and I havent looked back. The downside is you cant lend games to your friends and family and you cant trade games in if thats your thing. The benefit however is you can switch games almost instantly without having to change discs or cartridges and you dont have to go to the store or wait for your games to be delivered to your house.One last aspect and one which many may not care about is the material usage. Buying physical copies is quite wasteful in terms of packaging and manufacturing. The cartridges cases and sleeves all need to be produced and on top of the materials required resources are also used in the production process. Yes going digital means Nintendo have to power data centres to host these games on their servers but this can be with clean renewable energy and the impact on nature can be far smaller. For me that means a lot but I know everyone doesnt see it that way.I will be staying digital. ,NintendoSwitch,dcgdiva,2,t5_3h47q

10345686,0,t1_dcgpaqp,I realize it now after the presentation. And it makes me very worried for Nintendo. People say Nintendo doesnt need to compete with PSXbox but in reality thats exactly who they are competing with. People will buy and play the system that has the games they want to play. Without the games the system dies. I really dont want to see that happen with the switch because the system is a great concept. The only thing Nintendo has over the other systems are their first party games. And for  all we know about is Zelda and mario at the end of the year if it even comes out at the end of the year. So my point is Im OK with the people who say theyre ok without the AAA games as long as they understand that the switch will not and cannot survive without them. ,NintendoSwitch,dcgqqrd,2,t5_3h47q

When you start up Elder Scrolls Grand Theft Auto Shadow of Mordor or The Witcher you can go anywhere in the world. You cant do that in Metroid. Its a very linear game that requires you to complete one part of the game before you can get to another. Same thing with Pokemon and early Zelda games. You cant start Pokemon and go straight to the sixth gym for example. This is why Breath of the Wild is being touted as an open world Zelda game. You can go anywhere on the map right from the very beginning. Nothing is forcing you to go from dungeon  to  to .     ,NintendoSwitch,dchyxf5,0,t5_3h47q

10366321,0,t3_5og6cj,No. It would fragment the software too much. Even if it was a static graphic all Wii U games utilized both screens at one time. Switch utilizes only one at a time. If they tried to shoehorn in only games that were mainly on the TV which they wont it would create too many limits for them to pull it off in any capacity. Also Im not a tech head by any means but Wii U was apparently a messy and complicated piece of architecture that may not translate to Switch in any manner at all kinda like how a  dollar super gaming PC cant run N games correctly. And lastly I just dont think the Switch would be powerful enough to emulate Wii U without an actual chipset on board which there may not be room for. Either way it just wouldnt work.

For example the GTX  is in the .X GF range and the RX  is in the .ish GF range. We already know they perform similarly. We can use this to draw comparisons on Maxwell and GCN in general. You can also use knowledge about the general architecture to do so. Again its FAR from precise but its very easy to draw the conclusion that Maxwell is more efficient than GCN . You can do the same thing with CPUs even without specific benchmarks. I can tell you right away that an A performs worse than a Core i at the same clock speed because it has worse IPC and ARM uses more instructions than x. It should also be weaker than the  core Jaguar CPU. I know less about Denver but its reasonable to assume that Nvidia wouldnt add their own custom CPU cores to a chip if they didnt perform much better than the A. ,NintendoSwitch,dcjfs6b,1,t5_3h47q

If Nintendo releases exclusives every other month then why not have it preordered and get it for ? Sure it may go down in price later on but how much cheaper do first party titles get? I got a Wii U about a year ago and Ive got  games for it on my shelf now. Ive been buying a bunch of games since the Switch was announced and while its not that financially straining on me I would much rather have bought those games when they came out so I could avoid the scrambling at the end.I plan on doing that with the Switch starting with BotW and Super Bomberman R.

I havent seen any browser icon or have heard anything about it. It seems to me that this console doesnt have enough power and resources to have all sorts of nongaming functions. In fact I think this is why the online app is on phones. I dont think they wanted to allocate RAM and OS space to host the online functions. I also think it would kill the battery life even faster so they moved it off of the device to tout a longer life.

Games contain stories characters ideas artwork and tons of stuff beyond the firsthand gameplay. All of that costs a lot of time money and effort to produce and all of that is conveyed by watching a video game being played by another person. Even if a person does end up purchasing a game after watching a Lets Play all of the novelty story surprises have been spoiled and in many cases their experience actually playing the game themselves is lessened because of it.Nintendos Youtube policy is just them going Hey we spent a lot of money producing all of that content that you are using in your videos and gaining ad revenue from. Well let you continue to profit off of it but only if we get a small cut of the revenue. Wed also like to make sure you follow some guidelines for how we want our content to be used just so we can ensure kids who like our video games arent exposed to anything they shouldnt be and establish a systematic and legal basis for this deal to make things easier for everyone.

The difference between the Swtich and PS is no different than the difference between the PS and Dreamcast. Its actually probably closer than the PS and Dreamcast. If the Switch is popular enough the PSXbox One will be the systems getting the crappy ports because games will be developed for the Switch then ported to the other systems. It is much easier for developers to create a switch version then upport to XboxPS than to downport to the Switch. I think that is one of the reasons that games that are releasing soon like KH will not be coming to Switch anytime soon. Once the switch has a decent install base third parties will be more willing to spend the time downporting or starting games on the switch.,NintendoSwitch,dcnp5ut,0,t5_3h47q

10422227,1,t1_dcpfci9,You have any source on that? From what Ive read it does nothing but provide extra current for overclocking the device to output up to p and also provide a USBC to HDMI out. That sounds like all passive components to me. The wallwart adapter could provide the current and a Ycable could provide the HDMIout the dock is apparently just to make it look more homeconsoley and less cluttered.

10422355,0,t3_5p9a21,TLDR Youre not the target market anymore.The features youve described are cool ideas but if you raise the retail price by  you might as well raise it by  and kids will have a much harder time nagging their parents for one.Lets assume for a second that the dock is nothing more than a pass through. Youve sourced it and baring any other counter credible information its a reasonable one.Its also entirely reasonable to assume that despite it costing the consumer  to replace that it doesnt cost  to manufacture and ship. At this point you need to know that for Marketing shenanigans  is a magic number. There is a psychological reason it isnt  flat. There is countless papers on this its probably in every Dgrade product management course. Its everywhere and all around ya.The cost of this piece of plastic is probably in the realm of about  at most. I dont have any evidence other than a baseless claim of I work in a similar industry and asking for blind trust. Feel free to assume your own cost for it. the vast majority of this is going in to USBC compliance components and HDMI regulatorylicensing costs. Even then I still think Im being overly generous on the costing.So the effect of adding or removing the dock as a cable management device is pretty minimal to the BOM which will be significantly lower than . Remember BOM does not include paying your staff operational costs logistics and marketing it is raw materials that exist in device.Now at this point its important to note that if the dock didnt exist you wont see a  drop in price or even a  drop in price. Your BOM cost does not have a  translation with consumer cost. hence all the articles of iPhones having  worth of components in them kind of thing. Its hard to say what the drop in retail price would be but probably low. Again an unsourced guess would probably be in the best consumer case scenario . But realistically theyll still price at  as its a magic marketing number.Now with what your talking about it is actually adding more components and cost to your BOM. That will drive up your retail cost. If you push it over the Magic number  even by  youre going to take full advantage of the fact that youre operating at a high cost category as far as the consumer is worth. So you are looking at a new retail cost of  at least Well  but Id say more likely .Are you getting a full  out of the features youve described. Well that vary from individual to individual but youve immediately out classedoutpriced an entire subset of consumers that Nintendo cares deeply about.Kids!Kids arguing to their folks that they want this will have a far easier time doing it at  than they will at . This is a huge market that is now significantly neglected and shrunk for the Switch.Now judging by your other posts youre a consumer that is willing to spend a fair bit on tech like this that you like.  for an Oculus rift puts you in a different class of consumer than the switch and who they are hoping and who they have historical data on to say buys their stuff. Ultimately while having the dream device that has perfect backwards compatibility to the N would be awesome the costs excludes everyone who isnt you and everyone who isnt like you and simply put you dont make up the majority of who they are selling to.,NintendoSwitch,dcpfyr3,12,t5_3h47q
10422410,0,t1_dcpfxgm,Correct but that and the patents which also promise a projector built into the side ha! are all we have to go from so this is a speculationdiscussion thread. If you dont want the features I would then comment but as I said I do want a Switch just wish it could do more.Valid point on overclocking. I meant it as a generic term for clocking up but overclocking is indeed specifically pushing beyond a processors rated speed so I stand corrected. However what I meant is that it is likely if not a given that the clock speed is reduced for portable play both to conserve battery and because the extra processing power isnt needed to drive a lower resolution display. Having mains power would remove this limitation. If youve ever used a gaming laptop you know that you will often see reduced performance when it is on battery power regardless of battery life. A LiPo battery simply cannot sustain the current draw for anything other than short bursts without exploding.,NintendoSwitch,dcpg6tl,0,t5_3h47q

10439448,0,t1_dcrd1z2,Just to start I am perfectly okay with the Switchs price point Ill be buying one and I dont suspect the price will harm in the Switchs success in the grand scheme of things. Im just playing devils advocate here. But the PS has a  and PS has a  on it on a hardware level its a very clear upgrade. The Nintendo Switch is not an upgrade its a sidegrade. Its PSs power vs. Nintendo Switchs portability etc. features. The PS essentially has a  lower price tag as well due to lower cost  bundled game. Itll come down to a consumer by consumer basis some will absolutely see PS is  cheaper and comes with a game? Im in! and others will see the features of Nintendo Switch and pick that. I just cant imagine a scenario where someone owning no game consoles goes to buy one and says yknow PS was  at launch so Ill buy Nintendo Switch instead. Theyll judge it by what they see now and what they expect the future value of those consoles to be in terms of experiences buying into the platform will allow them at current and over the products lifespan. Of course this is completely sidestepping game libraries which will likely be the biggest factor but Im just targeting the key point from OP that the bundles argument fails.,NintendoSwitch,dcrdxw3,1,t5_3h47q

VR will get there but it will take much more powerful machines to power such devices.We wont see PCs that can play higher resolution VR for three or four more years minimum. So Im glad Switch isnt.

To put it in another context imagine button controls as a standard and motion controls as an advanced controller capable of a myriad of macros with easy inputs.

10494639,0,t3_5now3t,Real talk with each passing day Im more and more convinced that Amazon messed up and accidentally lumped all the console preorders into the Grey preorders. With the fact that on every other international Amazon site had them as one page where you select which console you want and the US page only did this after their preorders went live meaning that Amazon flubbed and sorta recognized them as separate products. The only reason why we havent heard anything yet is because its going to be a PR nightmare on how they plan on remedying this. And customer service clearly doesnt know whats going on so their superiors telling them to say Nintendo hasnt given us our stock numbers is the easyout while still making it look like within the realm of possibility...but it doesnt add up because all the other Amazon sites were given their allocated amount.tldrthe people who made the Amazon US listing fucked up big time.,NintendoSwitch,dcxoeha,8,t5_3h47q

I just dont think thats how it happens in most cases if ever.I dont think anyone does it to be scummy  everyone is just trying to make money.  Plenty of people are willing to pay a premium so that they dont have to wait in line for something  there is nothing wrong with that.  In fact thats probably the primary reason why there is a market for it.  As far as I can tell there will always be a market for this type of economic activity as well.Thanks for sharing the story and experience  maybe it will affect some peoples view over the whole thing.

Dont tell us there will be third party support when companies like Capcom said they have no interest in bringing games like Resident Evil  to the Switch. Aside from Zelda and Mario it looks like the console is getting an onslaught of mobile app games. After the Wii U Nintendo needs to be more upfront with what theyre selling. If theyre going to announce a paid online service at least give us a glimpse of what it has to offer and why we would want to pay for it. The fact that theyve been so quiet about the console and theyre only a month away from launch is disconcerting. Im with you too in the sense that I want to cancel my preorder but the child in me says to keep it. Im just worried this is going to turn into another Wii U.

I wouldnt find myself actually having many occasions to play with other people I mean I would be able to do it some scenarios but it wouldnt be frequent enough for me to justify buying the system.

10527003,0,t1_dd1b3vq,You kind of do though.Modern games have huge development costs both in time and money.  This makes big publishers risk adverse and unwilling to support games that dont check the boxes that make them feel safe.  Its pretty clear when you look at the ratio of grittybrownshooters to more innovative games.  Or how there are a lot of amazing indie games.  Their costs are lower and they can afford to do their own thing. Consider the vita too.  While there are a lot of factors that contributed to its unimpressive sales the higher cost of development certainly didnt encourage publishers to support it.  When the alternative was to pay less to produce p games for the ds.So while youre not necessarily wrong production cost is a factor here.

10538960,0,t1_dd2lm6t,As soon as I entered the room my eyes were drawn towards it. I approached it my body ready. The first thing I did was touch it. My hand moving oh so gently along its whole body feeling every curve every feature as my fingers went along its smooth and dimply surface. Then I found its button. You know. The one in the back  with a slight press it jumped out at me. It relinquished all control to me. I could use it in any way shape or form I wanted. And that pleased me. I started playing with it oh the fun I had playing with it. It would excite me with its unique ways of doing everything. It was so good my hands would tingle.And then I put it in its cage.... And it took the reigns. So much larger than life. I was now the one being toyed with. My eyes treated to a symphony of pleasures. Yes it had me and I did as I was told. It seemed so comfortable in the cage so at home but still it beckoned me over.  Yes. You will be mine again. And I will take back control. Good girl. Good switch ,NintendoSwitch,dd2phy6,31,t5_3h47q

10561281,0,t1_dd55p8t,I beg to differ granted Wikipedia is not always a reliable source but the OoT article statesOcarina of Time D was developed by Nintendo EAD in partnership with Grezzo...And from MMsThe Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask D is an actionadventure video game codeveloped by Grezzo and Nintendo...Therefore Nintendo most likely had some involvement in the development of both. Granted it probably wasnt as much as Grezzos but if you think Nintendo had zero involvement with the development of both ports then I would tend not to agree with that unless Nintendo themselves has officially said they didnt. They would have to provide assets such as art and perhaps the original code base to start with at the least I would think. Granted Im not a video game developer or programmer but I think having those things would help with the porting process.,NintendoSwitch,dd58o0k,1,t5_3h47q

10563362,0,t1_dd5gqoe,gt It makes sense for them to make a profit off hardware because it provides a second revenue stream to game sales. More revenue  more money to make great games. Not to mention the extra money they make off licensing fees. I would rather make money in three places than lose a lot of money in one and pray the other two revenue streams make up for it. Well the logic is you need this single device to allow us to sell you all this other stuff with higher margins so if you take a loss to get that into the consumers hands youll make more on controllers or games or services. Its neither right or wrong but eveyone needs a switch to buy  use switch games controllers etc... so making the barrier to entry for that  sale lower could should drive other numbers higher.,NintendoSwitch,dd5h5x6,1,t5_3h47q

Third party developers will likely have already been signing on so were likely to seehear some coming soon stuff from Sega Squenix Capcom Epic Games Level EA. The possibility seems higher to get something unexpected in this system than with previous ones. So Ill go for broke in order of likelihood and say Psychonauts  Digimon World Destiny  Death Stranding and Horizon Zero Dawn will be announced for the Switch. My dream series revivals would be Dark Cloud Perfect Dark Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger. Probably get a ton of details about the online system as a whole and get one or two surprises to push players to use it. Probably an MMO if I had to guess. Surprise Goldeneye on virtual console....

10575128,0,t1_dd6moiy,well most of us who ordered the switch FOR WHAT IT IS will be pretty happy.Nintendo is not and never will be a AAA pumping machine. It is NOT a PS NOT a XB and NOT a PC. It is not playing in the same league and does not target the same audience. Even then PS had what as AAA games on launch? Assassins creed  and BF rest were all NameOfSport and small games. XB had pretty much the SAME games  Forza for what its worth. Two consoles same games.Nintendo has probably  ports and  new games at launch a lot of them being exclusive to Nintendo.Then the argument about stretching the bigger titles makes sense to me especially since people are less likely to buy consoles during summer because yes some of us go outside. Putting big titles there ensure there wont be too big of a pit in sales during summer. Then I expect having other titles added for the holidays E reveal probably for the real launch. March rd is a die hard fan launch or early adopter.And as I want to say to everyone who complains about the games at launch... Buy it in a year if the content does not interest you.

Plus the reaction to the PS Pro was fairly mixed and Sony will have to contend with a new console this year which could have a small or large impact depending on how well it does.

10606263,0,t1_dd91045,Arent we only expecting maybe a x boost between U and Switch and thats docked if even? Its not the boost thats impressive here its the fact its handheld. The bigger feat of impressiveness is the jump between DS and Switch...WOW!As far as PS vs Pro  thats a half step console like DSi amp New DS anyways but a .x boost is still impressive when you were already the graphics leader.  Even so the way its handled only people with K TVs will really benefit from it for  of the games. Scorpio is a way for MS to make up for how ridiculously bad they did on the XBO... well see how that goes. Right now theres not exclusive enough games on that platform to be interested and they are putting them on the PC anywaysEither way i think what his point was is trying to shrink something the power of the PS or Pro into a handheld would be impressive... and I think thats what the half step for the Switch in  years will be honestly with nVidias GPUs evolving,NintendoSwitch,dd9yduo,3,t5_3h47q

10609254,0,t3_5rpdu7,So this is a bit offtopic but I have just been so curious about the gyro controls in Splatoon and other games. I dont own the game but wanted to try out gyro aiming. I figured I was out of luck but apparently Windwaker HD has gyro aiming. Somehow I finished the game without ever realizing this? Or was it added later in a patch or something?Anyway I went to try that out and actually yeah its a pretty cool aiming system except for one horrendous problem. The leftright aiming is reversed from what is natural. Its completely bizarre. You tilt the pad left and turn right. You can change the direction of updown but not leftright. Are all Nintendo games like this? For the love of god tell me please that other games allow you to unreverse it.,NintendoSwitch,dda9hqg,2,t5_3h47q

But I dont think there exist a wall charger  hdmi device that would connect to USBC.The dock probably has some software that tells the switch that this is the official dock output to p and charge and check all USB devices connected to the dock.I also think it will be pretty hard for the other companies to make unifficial switch dock without nintendos approval  help.,NintendoSwitch,ddc6onj,1,t5_3h47q

10653666,0,t3_5sg3il,I will reiterate this due to past experiences with ports from Nicalis. Keep in mind I have a combined  hours between the PC version of the game. I dont hate them. But they are inherently unable to provide a proper port experience to this date.If you have the money and want to take the risk preorder the game. However Nicalis has proven before that they either lack the ability staff or will to provide a proper port of their games.  The two mobile versions of their games launched with. Crashes. Bugs. Content locked behind bugs. Framerate issuesAnd they took months to fix the most basic which was causing multiple crashes throughout a play through. At present The DS and Vita versions are still rife with bugs which they seemingly abandoned .Their console versions were a little better but still suffered from huge issues some of which were never fixed. My initial plan going forward as someone who has supported them by buying  copies total is to wait for the initial wave of reviews and problems to rise and decide then if the value is worth it. To me this isnt about saving money but holding the development team to a standard which most people expect. The fact past game bugs which crash games still isnt fixed in ports in concerning.

10683517,0,t3_5stlqo,Never. Ive used the Youtube and Netflix app on every console though including the Wii U gamepad.The last time I used a console browser was for the Wii before I had every device connected to my TV and before there were a million other more convenient devices. By the way its awesome how much hardware has moved on since the Wii released going from one PC to having about  devices sitting around the house all with wireless capability? Even when Im carrying my half tablet half laptop with me Ill still use my phone to look something up so the Switch having a browser... itd be a nice little extra as long as its fast so you could easily look up walkthroughs while playing. But overall I wouldnt care if it never got a browser. Again Youtube and Netflix though? Id definitely use both of these as long as we got a charging dockstand that allowed portable use like the Wii U gamepad dock. I used to put my Wii U tablet in that and use it as a YTNetflix player all the time before I owned a real tablet.Then again I can see kids enjoying console browsers while their parents hog the computers or tablets and put parental locks on everything. I bet most parents overlook the PS browsers parental lock. So itd be nice to see a browser eventually but Im not the kind of person whod use it.,NintendoSwitch,ddhx9su,1,t5_3h47q

10693558,0,t1_ddid5kw,gt  Doctors having control over the entertainment people in hospital use? That is  not the case and Im pretty sure they have a lot more pressing matters to attend to. And portraying hospitals as quiet places where people just sit in a bed and arent allowed to have fun is offensive. Ive worked in the pediatric health system for over ten years and video games are vital in helping the wellbeing of patients. A blanket statement like what patients need is a cure is also a highly offensive statement with many patients with condidtions that dont have a cure and use the hospital for treatment. For them the hospital is just part of their normal routine like going to school or shopping and use of video games is a way to keep them social connected to the hospital community and bring some normalcy to their visits. Especially as research has proven that play and entertainment in a hospital setting decreases anxiety in young patients leads to more cooperation with medical staff a lot less missed appointments meaning doctors can attend to more patients and a positive wellbeing leads to a faster recovery. The only thing offensive in this thread is your outdated views. And for the record Ive got a couple of Switches preordered for use with patients and  Switch is going to be a fantastic rehabilitation tool.   ,NintendoSwitch,ddiym70,10,t5_3h47q

Admire the Switch whilst turned off and attach the dock to the TV Ill have actually got around to setting up in my room by then. We recently moved house and Im lazy. Turn the Switch on admire the UI look through all the Settings etc. Test docking and undocking make sure charging seems to be working. Unbox BotW LE admire the Master Sword statue and the cartridge. Start up BotW play first few minutes as handheld then play on TV for a few minutes. Probably put the dock back in the box because I like playing on handhelds and Ive heard BotWs frame rate is better with the smaller resolution anyway.

Given not all of these are launch day systems some are. Theres always a chance of a technical problem from Nintendo but I havent come across them yet. The problem with my GCs were user errors mostly. As for benefits for the Switch in particular Id agree with most of the other comments and say instant gratification. I wanted to secure my preorder so I wouldnt have to wait for the nd wave of shipments which honestly could potentially be as early as April. Youd be able to enjoy the system with early adopters but also share in the risk of a system failure which I honestly believe wont happen.Theres naturally more benefits to waiting potential price drop Maybe way later down the line bundles bigger game list less likely chance of system failures. You dont have to be in a rush if youre on the fence about it but it sounds like you can afford and that you really want it. Id say go for it.

Thats entirely fair.I dont personally think the sky is falling because I dont have use for the feature anyway. My Switch will be primarily used as a home console and when Im traveling I have a phone that I can tether it with though depending on how Nintendos online service shakes out I might not bother with online titles at all.My most optimistic reading of the situation is that what Nintendo really means is there will be no browser at launch so people will be SOL for captive wifi for a few months until Nintendo gets their act together and catches up with some of the features that should have been available at launch. Thats pretty normal. The PS was missing most of the PSs media features for something like a year.gt You dont think anyone that works at NOJ NOE or NOA ever connected to hotel wifi for ANY reason in their life and that they are too dense to realize Oh yeah login pages are a thing nah well leave them out anyway?I dont think NOA or NOE factor into this.

But two more people can join a private match as a photographer but an internet connection is needed to add those two other players. And photographers arent players in the match but spectators who can hop between the perspectives of the different players. When I first read everything it seemed like they were saying that ten people could join together in online matches where two would be spectators.

So relative to their respective screen sizes theyre both about the same sharpness.To compare a Retina  iPad has  PPI.  So it seems like theres some kind of engineering sweet spot around that PPI with regards to power consumption GPU fill rate and battery volume.I actually suspect that if we see any AAA ports they might run at p or p in handheld mode just to keep the framerate up.

Dont give your money to a gaming corporation to hold onto. They havent given you a product yet. And there have been stories of preorders being cancelled preorders disappearing from the system etc. One Redditor even posted a story that he put down  and he went in a few weeks later and Gamestop had no record of the transaction.EDIT Lol all the downvotes. I guess people dont like their own money in their pocket.There was a post last week on here. Redditor put down money on his Switch preorder at Gamestop. Went in a few weeks later to put down more money on it. Gamestop had no record of him giving them money or taking a preorder.There was a post yesterday from someone who ordered a Neon Switch. Went into the store yesterday to put more down on it. Gamestop only had an order for him for a Gray Switch. And he had no receipt to prove otherwise his fault.In  I went into Gamestop on day one to preorder the Xbox . I paid it off in full a few weeks before the system launched. Gamestop called the night before and told me they didnt have a console for me. I didnt get it for another month.These examples are all instore preorders. Will you likely be fine? Sure. But the only people I trust with my money are my bank and myself. But mostly myself.As someone else mentioned when its in your own account its generating interest for you albeit pennies. When its in Gamestops account its generating interest for them. Not boy that but youre making multiple trips to the store. Using more gas. More time.Paying off a console early isnt an achievement.

10732281,0,t3_5tiibi,I recently learned how to pick locks in real life have gotten pretty good at it and I can confirm it is almost entirely by feel. You hold tension on the lock with the Tensioner While using several methods to try to click each tumbler into position. The Tension placed on the barrel causes the Pins to lock in place and only the stiffest of all the pins will go up and lock into place. On a  pin lock each pin has a numbered order of which will go up first and its random from lock to lock. Back to the feeling bit. The whole process is done by feel alone as you cant see into the lock. HD Rumble could most likely relay just about everything required for an accurate lock picking experience. ,NintendoSwitch,ddmyden,12,t5_3h47q

10732665,0,t1_ddmle8g,Its a next gen handheld with the power to seamlessly go from couch to portable to couch in a couple seconds. To say the Switch is really far behind compared to the current gen is unfair it runs p FPS docked and ps pro can upscale to k but isnt true k so the tech is a little more advanced in the switch considering its a portable device with the capability to run games while docked at the same native resolution as the Ps. Being a portable p indie  JRPG machine is enough to give it the sales of the vita and DS combined but considering how much support Nintendo is giving this thing? The advertising campaign alone is evidence of how much Nintendo cares about the Switch succeeding. Taking into account how companies like NIS and Nicalis have said how easy and fast porting is for the switch I foresee a long life for the switch just from st partyindieJRPG sales alone. ,NintendoSwitch,ddmzso5,4,t5_3h47q

Skyrims limited attack animations power attacks especially are weird to use even with KBampM it would probably only be worse with the sort of sensitive motioncontrol the Joycons provide.    The only real benefits I can see Skyrim having in a Switch port is HD Rumble for the lockpick minigame and spellweapon feedback motion aiming for spells and bows and maybe some extra bindable controls such as camera zoom. Unfortunately I dont think Bethesda rebuilt any core game concepts to take advantage of the unique Switch hardware  at its core the game must remain playable fully with just a Pro Controller on the TV so thats how they will have made it.,NintendoSwitch,ddnoyn0,6,t5_3h47q

Steam XBL PSN hell even things like Ubisofts uPlay or whatever has Achievements. People like them and they arent hard to implement so I ask Nintendo why not??Ive just seen some people act like them not adding a system like this would be a deal breaker or something which I honestly just cant fathom.And I like to defend Nintendo when I think theres something that people are overreacting to. Im well aware that theres some weird BS theyre pulling with the Switch like the chat mode being a freaking app for your phone and no video streaming apps or web browsers.

10772093,0,t3_5mzqr1,It would entirely be dependent on  factors.  which is most important. Platinum Games owns the IP rights to Scalebound. If Microsoft owns it then it is likely that this game is dead. And . If the game can be salvageable since the fact alone it was cancelled suggests a very troubled development. I cant help but suspect that  wont be much of an issue as I believe the issue lied with Microsoft. Anyone that has payed any attention to Microsofts history with game publishing should know by now they are not too tolerant with delays from third party developers. Over the years they have canceled a LOT of games because they would not meet promised deadlines few of them ever manage to get outside funding to resume development remember the canceled Marvel MMO that became Champions Online? Not to mention Devils Third.I think its pretty clear as far as a total guess can be Platinum took too long to deliver a quality game Microsoft did its thing and cut them loose they could not continue selffinancing the project.,NintendoSwitch,ddr29d1,1,t5_3h47q

10775532,0,t1_ddrdj5j,Again reread what I said in previous comments.Other AAA games while debatably also bad never were desperate enough to have preorders for Season Passes. For what? To pay early to wait longer? And for some Switch shirt in game as well as useful items? Even then I dont think that just because others do it that they should or the opposite that they shouldnt do what others should. I mean hell this could be Amazon itself setting it early instead of Nintendo but I still feel like its wrong to preorder as itll encourage desperate practices and content will more be about getting a few extra pennies from consumers instead of giving quality content. I just dont wanna encourage shitty practices for quick cash and dont want Nintendo to become that. Therefore I think its a bad idea to preorder because a sizable amount of preorders may encourage trying to get quick cash more often.,NintendoSwitch,ddrf2oj,0,t5_3h47q

10778890,0,t3_5u12y2,On previous threads on this subreddit people went apeshit if you werent  for it and even the hard core Zelda fans on rZelda were far more balanced. As I give zero fucks about downvotes heres my opinion. Its complete bullshit that a game in development this long is still being released unfinished. The first pack is useless crap the second are things most people wont care about even people in favor of the DLC have said over the last few days that they arent interested in the first two packs and the third pack is cut content that should have been in the game but was cut to meet the rushed March launch of the Switch. Im extremely disappointed in Nintendo for pulling this crap. Ive been very outspoken in favor of the Switch and constantly told people to give Nintendo the benefit of the doubt on things like the online service but this is just too far. I honestly think that theyll hurt the launch with this since theyve now announced that the only system seller game for the first three months is unfinished and cant be completed until Christmas. I realize its anecdotal but everyone I know in real life who preordered is strongly considering canceling their preorder over the unfinished game myself included.,NintendoSwitch,ddrrix0,5,t5_3h47q

I cant even tell you what it is that pulled me in but I was hooked. Hell by the end of the game I still didnt fully understand the combat system so I never really mastered taking down those high level  enemies but I still had fun with the game.

Similarly if I by extremely vague  DLC and it ends up being something as simple as a double damage hard mode and a prologue story dungeon Ill also be upset.From a company that has brought consistently wellpriced and informative DLC they never marketed Smash DLC as Buy A Character for .!

He was thrown a curveball and instead of handling it swiftly like a professional he stumbled on an internationallyviewed show. He almost picked up the pace as the developer continued to speak but you can feel how aslant the translator was. To be honest when I first saw it I felt like someone set the translator up for failure by having him assigned to Suda.         Anyway you cant blame people for saying the dude should be fired. He had one job and he made a huge mistake hurting the image of Suda for all english speakers englishspeaking investors because of the lack of translation.   If a nurse in a hospital made a mistake at their professional job it is malpractice. It hurts the client the company the nurse represents and causes all sorts of trouble with law.   If a lawyer made a mistake in their professional job it can lead to the imprisonment of their client or intense financial repercussions and destroying their reputation as a trustworthy lawyer.  But guys this UPS driver was doing their best. Its not their fault the house was on such an odd address. You cant blame them for delivering the package to the wrong house! No but there sure were better ways to approach the conflict.    Thusly you want to wear the big boy shoes that is being a professional you need to deliver like a professional.

10833657,0,t3_5uvsuy,Not possible. The SNES and later N controllers were linked to a greater system see a website called NintendoGateway.com on archive.org or search Nintendo Gateway on Google that was the same content system that allowed hotels and certain airlines to provide access to movies this being in an era largely before broadband Internet.If you are old enough to remember the N or SNES controllers you remember that they were wired in and you couldnt add any games to it. They only had a set list of games on the system usually the first party Nintendo titles and a few third parties so nothing that required peripherals nothing two player and nothing too obscure.And they charged a kings ransom for it in the early s this was  per hour. It worked for a while but I think they were ultimately outmoded by the Internet and all that. Unless the Switch is a massive iPhonelevel success like  Million Units in less than three years type success you wont be seeing none of that and if it WAS a massive iPhonetype success extremely unlikely but you never know hotels would have a dock to rent out.,NintendoSwitch,ddxeyu4,2,t5_3h47q

Its exactly the same thing the other  consoles do im not saying Nintendo cant do this and once again i dont care that they do. Whilst it is sad to see the last free console online experience leave the space i definitely dont hold the decision against Nintendo. Im saying you picked the th of the market who doesnt charge you for online multiplayer and tried to use them as an example rather than the other  that do the exact thing Nintendo is emulating.

10841052,0,t1_ddwwgnv,It was though. The DS utilizes one large cheap screen which is only split into two by a physical border. It lacks the hardware necessary to do d and the total component cost is supposedly a good deal cheaper. Again though what mattered to parents about the ds was that it was priced  dollars cheaper then the standard ds and  dollars cheaper then the more popular xl model. The easiest way to get that level of savings with a Switch variant is... Go smaller and less modular. Also there are parent advantages to a non modular design as well specifically they dont have to worry about the kid losing their  dollar joycons. The model could still do everything the big Switch could it would just drop the cost of entry by likely  assuming a  price drop and a new  dock sold separately. Single console portable splitscreen is the only real loss and just like the loss of d on the ds its something I think Nintendo will be happy to sacrifice on a cheaper model.,NintendoSwitch,ddy6eym,1,t5_3h47q

I noticed when doing so that the contents of my BoTw had changed now to the Master Sword statuecd edition that is being sold in the UK.So I had mixed feelings happy I was getting a cool Master Sword statue but sad I was losing the mapcase.Anyone know of any options I have currently?

They can look into your order and see the actual status.I originally preordered a Switch and Zelda from Best Buy cancelled Zelda but kept the Switch a few hours later was going to use Amazon Prime. A few weeks ago I decided I should check in on my pre order just to be safe. Entered the order and it showed that my purchase was not in the system. Started freaking out thinking I had messed up my preorder. Did chat with BB and they got my  and looked into it and they said because I cancelled Zelda thats why it wasnt showing up on my end. The preorder for the Switch was still live in their system and I would be good to go. Hope this helps.,NintendoSwitch,de1epd0,1,t5_3h47q

Im worried it wont be able to sustain the sales but if they put all the right games out then I think it will be okay.Metroid Smash Pokemon and other classic titles should solidify long term sales. Lets see what happens. The important thing is that they get them out in a timely manner.

Because had they held it until fall but released Zelda now on Wii U theres no way they could hold it until fall on that system theyd be effectively killing most of the Switch purchases. You see how rabid fans are about spoilers now  imagine if they were waiting another  months with the game literally in the wild the whole time. This wouldve been a much stronger launch in the fall with everything good to go but theyre doing it now to avoid Scorpio and RDR and it might play out for them but we cant act like its a perfect launch by any means. ,NintendoSwitch,de43cu1,2,t5_3h47q

10900692,0,t3_5voorv,Heres my two cents about the Joycon issue.Nintendo has been publicly showing this thing off allover the world in various demos and events for a good month or so now and no one has really brought up the left Joy con issue till now.I get its a controlled environment but there was was a dozen or so Switchs running at each event. you dont think some Youtuber or someone from Kotaku wouldnt of jerked off to completion to be the one to break the Joycon issue early?What I think is happened and the video thats being shared around like shows this is that the Joycons since they work on Bluetooth dose not have the best range on earth and the signal is getting messed with causing latency and issues. the guy in the AMA thread even said it worked fine in one room but had a couple seconds in a session where the Joycon was messing up a bit in another room.So I think its environmental for now But Im speculating to be sure.,NintendoSwitch,de4bupg,17,t5_3h47q

Some are dangerously noncompliant.More importantly Ars Technica attempted to use a standard USBC power bank VA with no successgtI thought the Switchs USBC charging port would mean I could use any standard external battery pack to charge the system away from an outlet on long trips. Testing with the Jackery Titan S though I was only able to get a trickle charge of about  percent every six minutes. That charge was so weak that during normal gameplay the Switch actually died on me while it was still plugged in to the external battery pack.Looks like a USBPD battery pack is potentially a requirement and there arent any great USBPD battery packs yet.,NintendoSwitch,de4l9bn,3,t5_3h47q

This issue likely is primarily a question of Do they have a way to update JoyCon firmware to increase the amount of power going to the bluetooth antenna.If they are able to theyre going to quickly experiment with what is the optimal amount of extra power it takes to boost the signal to fix the issue. Theyre not going to sit around and let the bad press caused by this issue build up and tarnish the release of their new console. This is a top priority all hands on deck issue to fix. These tend to get fixed by small bugfix patches that get sent through QA as quickly as possible.

10910837,0,t1_de5crb7,The math checks out pretty well for the underclock in handheld and the difference in pixels between handheld and docked. Going from p to p reduces pixel count by more than half . and the load on the GPU scales pretty linearly with pixel count. This lines up pretty well with the most recent gflop leak. Basically if it runs at p docked it will likely run just as well at p undocked.CPU reliant stuff like physics are a bit different. But its the GPU in the Switch that is anticipated to be the bottleneck not the CPU. The hard part will be getting it at p docked in the first place. ,NintendoSwitch,de5dizb,3,t5_3h47q

Openworld RPG make your character and run around a big ass continent doing whatever you feel like whether that be follow the main quest like a good boy or spend  hours exploring random caves breaking into a shop and stealing their items craft things etc. Part of what makes the elder scrolls so freeing is that many things in the world are actual items you can pick up and mess around with in the actual world itself. Lots of little interactions. Drop a sword in the middle of the marketplace a guard might yell at you not to leave your things lying around where they can hurt someone or someone might pick up the sword and return it to you or ask to keep it beggars might fight over it etc. Breath of the Wild seems like its trying to imitate some of those open world things that elder scrolls does,NintendoSwitch,de6iu6d,4,t5_3h47q

Being hardcore to me is about the level to which you seek to invest yourself into a gaming experience and things like how voice chat works or the lack of Bluetooth support and such dont limit how much you can invest yourself in the experience they just make them more annoying to do so.These features are bad they are annoying but saying theyre casual is just not understanding the meaning of casualhardcore but rather just throwing around buzzwords.,NintendoSwitch,de6l2j7,3,t5_3h47q

Today on the NVC podcast you can watch it on YT they were saying there occasionally is a bit of frame rate dip when playing in docked uprezzed mode. Not a big deal but it does seem to show the Switch is basically being pushed to the limit with this game.Granted the game is basically a modified Wii U game at heart. I wonder how much more they can push out of it with future games entirely made for the Switch.,NintendoSwitch,de6quzh,7,t5_3h47q
10924163,0,t1_de6ov32,Free online since Nintendo has never delivered a solid online experience and this looks to be no different. Power brick built into the base since its almost completely empty space. I mean this one really gets on my nerves. Its empty space Nintendo!Controllers that stay connected  feet away. A storage card included in the box so you actually have the capability to download a full game. Virtual console. Companion app that manages parties since none of it is handled on the console. Maybe a couple more games. Though Zelda is a pretty huge deal. I think this about covers what I think should be included. Edit Shows why I should read the comment chain completely. Supposed to be a list of whats needed to make it a tablet. Lol whatever. Its barely a gaming console while it lacks the stuff above let Nintendo focus on that before adding features. ,NintendoSwitch,de6r221,-7,t5_3h47q

Ive been using a touch screen laptop for around a decade now and am very accustomed to tapping on menus rather than using the cursor.Something Im thinking about right now is movies. Of course the Switch doesnt play movies on launch but I think everybody hopes it will be. Is it going to tip over if I poke it to pause? What about changing volume or changing position of a video?Especially from CNETs perspective where they review the Surface Pro which has an amazing full back kickstand the Switch does leave something to be desired.

10950669,0,t1_de9da2o,Whenever someone mentions that they could release Gamecube VC games by implementing a workaround it kind of reminds me of people saying that the Switch could play DS eshop game with some kind of portrait mode workaround. They technically could but they wont. Even if there are a small percentage of Gamecube games were analog triggers are fully integrated I doubt Nintendo would use a patchwork fix like mapping the triggers to motion controls. And you cant really map them to buttons with simple  or  values. If Gamecube does come to virtual console youll probably need the controller adapter or some special edition joycons they release down the line.,NintendoSwitch,de9hfh2,0,t5_3h47q

10958224,0,t3_5whh76,I found this little quote kind of funny.gt  Trip Hawkinsgt Former CEO The DO Company oversaw the DO launchgtNintendo for literally a hundred years was a great toy company.  In their first several years in the video game business they were a really great toy company in this new electronic toy category and basically their products were purchased mostly by children. And then when it became a medium and it became a platform and they had to start competing against the likes of Sony it got to be a lot harder for Nintendo and they began to think of themselves as Oh yeah were a media platform company and were competing against PlayStation.gtWell theyre not going to make it in the long run with that kind of thinking. And if you think about whats really great about Nintendo its the games that they have invented like Mario and Pokemon that they have popularized these incredible brands. Theyre now beginning to realize that yeah they really need to allow those brands to flourish on all the other platforms that are not proprietary Nintendo platforms and thats a big change because they never used to do that. They used to basically drive the sales of their own proprietary platforms by restricting these famous brands to be the killer apps for those platforms. But I dont think its viable for them to think of themselves as a generalized console platform company. They really shouldnt make a hardware system anymore in the future unless its kind of a great toy. Like for example when the Game Boy came out that was a fabulous toy. And it came out with Tetris and then Pokemon came out on it and that was really all you needed to know to decide that you wanted to have a Game Boy.gtI think the Switch is going to disappoint. I think the optimists are saying its going to sell  million units and theyre saying that because theyre looking at Wii U selling  million units and theyre looking at the original Wii selling  million units and theyre thinking Well it couldnt possibly go as badly as it did with the Wii U. And in my opinion it could go just about the same because their price point is really high. The Switch is  bucks and thats not a toy price. Thats a media platform price. And they cant win that game even with proprietary you know killer apps. I just think that they have to have more modest expectations when theyre in the hardware business that if they have a low enough price point maybe they can get the  million units sold and its going to be a very successful toy for them. And their future value and future profit is going to have a lot more to do with what they do with their great brands and their capacity to create new games on all the platforms not on their own.I feel like hes going to have to eat his words. I mean the DO didnt do good so youre raining on Nintendos parade?,NintendoSwitch,dea9h4g,42,t5_3h47q

10963024,0,t1_deaodtx,Theyre downvoting you but youre exactly right. These people cant come to terms with the fact that the Wii was lightening in a bottle and Nintendo happened to catch it. The Wii got exposed for what it truly was when the fad started to fade. The Wii was an electronic pet rock.You cant look at attach rates and say software sold well on the machine. You just cant. The Wiis attach rate was inflated because there were a shit ton of games on the thing and an ass load of that shit ton were regularly in bargain bins. Whose local department store didnt have a bargain bin full of Wii games? Nintendo had a handful of first party games that sold very well but everything else did not. Look at the numbers. What did Xenoblade Chronicles sell? Not a million I can tell you that in spite of there being over  million potential buyers. And its the same thing for lots of other games. Red Steel? Red Steel ? Red Steel  sold about as many copies in the USA as Chicken Shoot. Now I wonder why that is? Hmm...The fact is and this is generally accepted in the industry and media casuals bought the Wii in droves. They played it a few times drug it out when their friends came over recorded themselves on their phones drunkenly punching at each other in Wii Sports then the fad died and the Wii got thrown in a closet. The diehards kept buying games but there just werent too many of them. Why do you think the Wii U did so poorly? The casuals didnt care and the diehard Nintendo fans were all that was left and that aint enough to sustain a console anymore.,NintendoSwitch,dearbmj,7,t5_3h47q

Everyone in the line was pissed and eventually Target employees kicked them out. I think this is the same scenario. If you leave the line youre out thats the end of it. This isnt grade school where we hold places in line and cut in front of others. Imagine if you were trying to get a Switch and  were available at launch. Well you get to the store and you notice the line is full but decide to wait anyways in case one of them drops out.

10966521,0,t1_deaknj8,Exactly.  Unless Nintendo pulls something out of thin air youre not going to see a repeat of the success they had on the Wii.  The Wiis success happened because it expanding its market base to include nontraditional gamers.  Its a classic example of finding a new market for a product.As it stands the Switch is positioned to appeal to fans of Nintendo IP casual gamers and gamers looking for something portable.  Theres plenty of market there for a very successful console doubly so if they can eat into the mobile gaming segment and grab the section of the market that plays phone games during their commute.If they can shore up solid third party support and get some big titles either developed for or ported to the Switch they can grab a good segment of the the hard core gaming crowd.Time will tell how well the Switch does but right now it looks like Nintendo is riding some great headwind.  They arent trying to fight their competition on raw power and instead are looking into an underserved market segment.  Theres plenty of success to be had but a repeat of the Wii is unlikely.,NintendoSwitch,deb4b1f,3,t5_3h47q

The D games have never really had that same feeling of overworld exploration largely due to some fairy or swordspirit or little demon urchin always chirping at you telling you where to go next and there being no other way. In the D games you could typically head a direction for a while only to then find it gated and having to turn back.

There are methods to get the token but you have to scan it over a device in close proximity they would also steal the same tokens from a credit card doing this. The difference is that your credit card information is behind a PIN or fingerprint with a mobile app and if a hacker did get your digital token from your phone by physically swiping your phone after you have given authentication from the app and make purchases with it it would give you a notification of it on the app. Apple Pay specifically had a problem with not verifying peoples credit cards so stolen cards could be added to the app and used but this is an app design issue not a mobile payment issue.

What you are describing is different markets. That is how all business operates  even KitKat and McDonalds have different flavours available in different markets.

And in that case Nintendo should have made these a long time ago and didnt need NFC tech.  They would have made a fortune.  They need a game like Lego dimensions or Disney infinity that just used the toys and lets you mix worlds.  If they had that on top of their uses across other games... thats a much different story in their usefulness.I think most people looked at the competition at the time and just expected them to do so much more.

Ive always like Nintendo games.Secondly more importantly I feel the Switch is what the Vita should have been and also where I think gaming should be headed. Full fledged gaming that you could get on a home console on the go. I dont think bigger hardware boxes with better software capabilities is the right way.

10995482,0,t1_dee9tql,What are you upset about exactly? The hybrid console is new. Reviewers are telling people about drawbacks. Drawbacks you yourself are using as excuses. The Switch is weak because its a hybrid but that doesnt make the weakness any less of an issue. Why is it okay for you to tell people that theres downsides to a hybrid but its not okay for reviewers to lost those downsides in reference to this hybrid? The Switch is weak regardless of why its weak. Its relevant that the weaknesses come with the advantage of portability and reviewers are acknowledging that as well as the weakness. Reviews dont exists to fairly assess things under established rules and they certainly dont have to follow your rules. They exists to provide consumers with information and opinions that help people know what they should buy. Thats what these reviewers are doing. They are essentially giving everyone the description of trade offs that you just gave me. If laptops were brand new it would be absolutely fair for reviewers to compare them to desktops so that consumers knew what they were getting. To do otherwise would be irresponsible. With Nintendo marketing this as a console its even more relevant to make those comparisons. ,NintendoSwitch,deeaxz0,8,t5_3h47q

But in this day and age running out of preorders on limited edition versions of games is not heard of hardly ever anymore let alone on day one minus the several five minute bursts theyve been available elsewhere until now.Are you really that hard pressed to admit this is just a classic Nintendo marketing tactic? Make supply scarce to increase demand? Because thats exactly why it was hard as balls to find a copy of the special edition anywhere after the first day it was available for preorder. The Master Edition yeah I get that thats a limited run. The special edition though? Really? At this point Im just bitching and its not going to change anything.

Well personally I dont like shooters and it is saturated in the market thats way I dont see gta as an all time better. The question in reviews should be does gta or any other game does what it proposes itself to do in the best way possible?

11006429,0,t1_defiawt,How does having to download games even out storage constrains? A lot of people think that Nintendo shouldve given us a bit more storage capacity. But there is probably a reason for this.So just on the storage side the Xbox and PS win. Probably if look into storage per cubic centimeter of the storage hardware used the switch would win  D this is the really important point.You cant really compare the pro controller to the Xbox one. The thing you can compare it against is the normal one which sells for  as far as I remember. But the pro controller for the switch includes some nice things the other one simply doesnt have so the price is justified.You also cant say that a single joycon is equivalent to a whole controller because there are lots of games you cant play on only one. They are just for multiplayer purposes. The fact that you can share them under specific circumstances is really cool however D But I actually think that  is actually quite much for a pair and Ill wait until their price drops... I dont really know why they are that expensive I guess that the Development cost them quite a bit since it is hard to put so much tec in such a little device but I cant really justify  for those. On the other hand they are more than one controller and the fact that they offer so many different playstyles is awesome  So the argument goes right back at you. You are very negative about the article you read because you really like the switch. They people investing in nintendo really like money and want to see more of that  D so they will see the negative things and point them out. Be aware of this and dont make the same mistake you just pointed out. If you want to discuss something do that in a tone that allows people to disagree with you. That is the only way you can find out whether or not you are right.,NintendoSwitch,defjqcx,2,t5_3h47q

11018174,0,t1_degutjs,He was ready to shell out  CAD... hardly expecting something for free... all he was expecting is that after shelling that money which for him is a fortune he could do something with the SwitchWe are already helping him... his budget includes our financial help as well which is why I didnt immediately offered to buy him a gamegt It seems sad to me to have him pass up that feeling and something that could provide a great amount of fun something Nintendo excels at because something wasnt free.Yes it is sad... but again its not because it wasnt free... its because on his own accord he felt it wasnt worth spending that much money for a console he could not play with until he saved enough to get a game on the sidegt There are plenty of cheaper indie games available for Are these the downloadable games people are mentioning? if so this could be a game changer and would make the no games no bundle at launch more reasonable,NintendoSwitch,degvo3v,1,t5_3h47q

11018880,0,t3_5gmnl0,I think they may not port windwaker unless they totally scrap the touch screen menu stuff.  Thats kinda the Wii U versions party piece for that game.  Game pad screen has all the inventory and map quick access stuff so you never have to explicitly pull up a menu screen on the TV to do stuff.  Its really cool and the only way I can see them doing this is if they totally do away with that and go back to the pull up menu like on Game cube version.Itd be a shame to have that game get left behind.  I intend to trade in my Wii U for a switch sometime in the later part of the year once I can clear through some of my Wii U backlog games but I may be a bit hesitant to let the system go if thats the only way to play WW HD.It looks way better running at kfps on CEMU emulator on PC but again the slick gamepad interface just totally makes everything so much nicer to work with.,NintendoSwitch,degyjsp,1,t5_3h47q

11023939,0,t1_deh2tzl,I remember Toys R Us announced they were going to have some stock in. I missed the first run or two. So I head up to the store on some random Sunday. I wait in the car because it was cold as heck out. Others were there in their cars as well. Close to the time when theyre about to open someone starts heading for the store which prompts all other others waiting to head to the door as well. What makes this interesting is that there was a family that was ahead of me. Mom dad  or  kids I dont remember. Since it was  per person because of demand they decided that each family member would ask for a Wii. I could tell that the clerk was pissed but officially they were following the rules.

11033913,0,t1_deinnz8,Yeah Walmart fucked up. They were suppose to ship these before launch day maybe  days before like Best Buy was doing. Walmart works different than other places so I guess since their processing center has way more traffic than other places the NS just didnt go out to the carrier on time so when they finally got it to the carrier IF they even got it to them. they opted for overnight shipping but went with standard overnight which is cheaper and doesnt allow for Saturday delivery. The switches ended up missing their flights for most of us although some were delivered. So since it didnt go out in time some ended up stuck in Fedex HUBs or theyre just sitting somewhere more than likely reaching destination on Sunday but they wont deliver until Monday. Anyway Walmart should have either gone all the way and paid for Priority overnight so they would at least deliver on Saturday or have just gone with  day shipping. Theyve sent out a lot of  dollar gift cards to people who didnt get their orders shipped out and if youre like me you got some sort of discount for complaining in chatphone. Theyre losing a ton of money on these Nintendo Switches all because their logistics department fucked up and they decided to be cheap with the overnight shipping. Oh well at least well get to play Monday right?,NintendoSwitch,deio3es,8,t5_3h47q

11037786,0,t3_5xke9i,This actually just happened tonightI was walking around a swamp area when I noticed three horses I didnt have one yet and I started following them. I snuck up behind the one I wanted and tried to get on but he kicked me before I could. This caused him to run further into the swamp. I followed and then a bunch of magictype enemies appeared throwing spells at me. I finally mounted the horse and got him to chill  but then I kept getting hit by the spells. Once I got away from them it started thundering out of nowhere I almost got hit like twice in a row. Just to be safe I took off all of my metal gear. Once I FINALLY made it to the bridge before the stables I got the cutscene with the blood moon and zelda telling you that enemies are stronger and all that so I was kinda freaked out that I wouldnt make it to the stables without running into some crazy shit. As I was about to cross the bridge I saw a lady being chased by a bokoblin with skeletons and keese nearby. I was able to fight em all off   and finally make it to the stables. That was seriously one of the most fun moments Ive ever had in a game. Just all the random stuff happening all at once was crazy. There was also that time I found a HUGE skeleton decaying in a tar pit and I had to fight off like  bokoblins on the thin spine section without falling into the tar. I havent even gone to Kakariko village yet! ,NintendoSwitch,dej43tn,3,t5_3h47q

11040503,0,t1_dejcbv2,In quality control theres the idea of condition upon first receipt. Thats not the technical name honestly I cant remember the technical name. If youre serious about QC you first want to make sure you get the product to a customer without any defects. One of the major automotive surveys I think its JD Powers focuses primarily on this. Then you want to see how well the product lasts once its being used. These are two closely related but separate things.

11045352,0,t3_5xnnal,Every console launch comes with comments and articles about a myriad of software and hardware issues large and small. Switch is no exception. Just as Microsoft had to hear for weeks about their XB launch choices so too must Nintendo listen to their own.I believe the crux of the issue is how surprising these issues seem to be for a Nintendo console. There is an expectation of thought and quality in a console from Nintendo.We think of how long they thought and planned for that little perfect click sound when sliding the joycon through the rails and yet didnt seem to think about how their dock would negatively interact with the tablet itself. It just seems frustrating and really highlights the idea that Nintendo can sometimes be like a beagle with a scent. They decided X is what they want to do and they go ham on that but while doing so they become blind to a few things on the way.,NintendoSwitch,dejyzbw,2,t5_3h47q

11058155,0,t1_deldpji,Its just because the market basically feeds us the game through trailers and tech demos to generate excitement and hype around the product. These trailers and tech demos think the Mass Effect Andromeda gameplay series overexpose the core game and leave little to discover since we already know what to expect. I agree that they should showcase the best aspects of a game to show consumers what to anticipate but they should also respect us as gamers and let us see skill trees weapons and abilities for ourselves. If a company plans for trailers and tech demos they should show the bare minimum rather then offering the entire package up front. In my opinion I feel that this kind of tampers expectations and limits enjoyment. I recently stopped watching trailers and gameplay videos once I have an understanding of how the game will look and play. This has ultimately changed the way I see games and has improved the experience immensely. After watching the reveal trailer for Breath of the Wild I ceased reading or watching anything that couldve spoiled the story or gameplay mechanics for me. Needless to say I was incredibly surprised there were survival mechanics added to the game as well as an RPG system. Pun not intended but t was a breath of fresh air. ,NintendoSwitch,delf9dl,2,t5_3h47q

11060557,0,t3_5xx7aa,Heres my unpopular opinion about thisI agree that the Switch also has had an interesting launch and Im fine with people pointing that out but honestly what pisses me off is people downgrading it to the point of it being a failure just because its not up to XboxPS standard when they were never intending to match it. I feel like a decent chunk of the hatred comes from the fact that many people downgrade Nintendo because they see them as a for familyfor kids company and how Nintendo seems to always go in an opposite direction than the others. It also just annoys me how the negativity always outshines the positivity. Ive heard so many more negatives than positives about the Switch and it just skews the perception about the console because people just want to gossip.

If we push the power button again it wont do anything until we hardreset it again.Weve never gotten an error code or anything. Last time it arbitrarily started working as we were on the phone with Nintendo asking what to send with it when we send it back for repairs it was that dire.Has anyone else had this?

11062138,0,t1_delopma,To be honest I am pretty confident its hardware issue. The buzzing loud levels probably vary from system to system probably not all the systems but those systems that have the buzzing problem. Each headset or earphones have a range of frequencies they output so its likely that one earphone outputs the buzzing more audibly than an another.I tried two headphones sets iPhone ones and Monoprice ...the two of them allowed me to hear the buzz but the Monoprice allowed me to hear the buzzing more clearly they seal my ears better than the iPhone setHere is the kicker I also plugged the Switch audio jack into my logitech z system and my Klipsch audio system inputs. When I did that I was able to hear the same buzzing being sent to my speakers. Thats why I am pretty confident its not the headphones. It could either be software or hardware...but its likely hardware it sounds like ground loops in audio systems So it might very well be that its not even the jack itself but the way it is connected with other stuff like the power supply i only have layman terms for these things but it makes sense from what ive been readingIn any case I actually sent my Switch for repair after talking to the Nintendo tech support folks. If they fix it then thats coolworse case scenario is that they send me a new Switch if its not fixable. I just hope that these audio issues are not so common that I end up receiving a new Switch that has the same problem!,NintendoSwitch,delvir7,2,t5_3h47q

Or Nintendo could at least reduce the amount of grass in Zelda by  or so since thats what seems to be causing the issues in that game the grass is likely choking the Switchs memory bandwidth which could explain why the same issues dont occur when undocked due to the lower resolution.,NintendoSwitch,demrdw9,3,t5_3h47q

11070065,0,t3_5y33bf,First sorry for hand drawing I havent a d model software. Second I know its not a human mistake proof redesign you could drop it off carelessly opening the hingeable top so it would need some attention when opening. The real Switch dock isnt human mistaken proof too but separating the top from the screen would avoid scratches more easily. My laptop have hinges that are very solid firm and hard for example that could be used on the dock making it easy to close and beautiful whenever the Switchd be docked and a  degrees opening wouldnt make it ugly a full opening port would be uglier imo. Third I know not everybody is having scratches problems that can be avoided with care and attention this is just a opinion on redesign and I want to know if you liked too. Fourth I havent a Switch yet ,NintendoSwitch,dems589,1,t5_3h47q

Then found out there was no rubber gasket and now the dock is scratching the screen lol. So I kinda just put  and  together that possibly Nintendo knew this was an issue and was testing this gasket idea to see how it held up.

11078869,0,t1_demvahk,As an ex retail employee I feel like I have to explain this a little. There are several reasons for the inventory to be off.Inventory gets added when the shipment arrives. However it takes a lot of unpacking and reorganizing and shelving units before they can be easily accessed. Sometimes employees can go the extra mile to do that for the customer aka check the back but its a long process and on busier days there might not be time. We get yelled by managers who sometimes more often than not care about numbers and less about service.Secondly customers who call ahead and claim one dont automatically deduct from inventory because thats done at the register.Usually the best system we have is putting a sticky note on the box and moving it behind the counter.Thirdly the internet page may calculate inventory from many different stores in the region or even from the warehouse. Unless its specifically stated for a single store. Even then if you were to buy online it could take a product from another nearby store or warehouse if they are also in shipping range.Last this is true for my time at Staples at least. Returns and damaged product gets manually re entered into inventory. Usually its in a separate column for breaks or returns but since its manually done there are sometimes mistakes. A clueless employee could see that the inventory says its there but when the customer comes and he checks and finds out its broken he has to say he cant sell you it.Retail stores have a lot of logistics and trading between stores and warehouses and the inventory system only updates when a shipment is dropped off returns or brokenunder warranty items are returned or when something is sold at the register.Its a tough world but I assure you most employers arent stupid or bad at their jobs. ,NintendoSwitch,dens2u0,1,t5_3h47q

11079472,0,t1_denjjni,I prefer physical myself but going digital isnt dumb.  There is something to be said for the convenience of being able to switch games without changing cartridges.  What is nice about physical though is in  years you still have all your games to play when servers are offline.  Think about the N or SNES if you had been all digital and had been deleting games to make room for new ones you wouldnt be able to play them right now.,NintendoSwitch,denujjt,2,t5_3h47q
11079483,0,t1_denttgr,I never wouldve never thought this would make such a difference but it really does. My gf is not into games but knows the systems pretty well because we use them for everything. For over a year she has made quips about how much she hates the Xbox every time we go to use it. Eventually I asked why and she said i just hate the interactions with it. It takes too long to turn on and get going and it seems to always need some new update. I just want to open Netflix.I dont carry her hatred for the Xbox but she isnt wrong. The switch really highlights how long those interactions are. I liken it to a documentary I saw on I think BMW. At one point it showed engineers shaving off slivers of time on a sound file the sound was the ding you would hear whenever you worked through the menu on the cars touchscreen display. The interviewer asked if that was really overkill to care so much about the length of that sound. The engineer basically said drivers will have to listen to this sound thousands of times during their ownership of this car. If its a little too long or too short it will eventually add up to being a significant annoyance. ,NintendoSwitch,denul61,14,t5_3h47q

Its hard though as fans and enthusiasts we feel this responsibility to defend the company we love so much. I figure the best way to do that is to have people play the system and play the games.

Which leads to the second point yea its been around for  years if thats even true but we still dont have many games that do optimization for it. The closest thing to  what you want is running an AMD APU and a GPU in unison.

It only releases one game per console and the individual changes from generation to generation are quite minimalistic but they add up over time.  Im not sure a Mario Kart  on the Switch would work without completely revamping the gameplay.  Generally I find that most people buy a new Mario Kart on a console to have Mario Kart on that console not because any given Mario Kart is a significant improvment over another.,NintendoSwitch,deqp5ou,1,t5_3h47q

11121986,0,t1_desm94p,gt With the first video it didnt seem to have a ton of contact with the front panel.You might be saying this because your dock is bent. The Switch is not supposed to have much contact with the front panel when you dock it. Not even when you are careless as you see in the video.Personally I dont have to force it at all. I can just slide it in easily without applying any pressure whatsoever and it clicks into place painlessly.gt That might be whats happening to everyone getting affected by this and it might explain why Nintendo didnt really catch itSounds plausible.

11124828,0,t1_desz4yj,They do have a very different team in place now and a different head of Xbox. But I would also say that those things actually had a ton of advantages for users.For one you could buy your games on disc but then not have to keep switching discs when you wanted to play different games. Its not a huge inconvenience but its much easier to just manage your games digitally and thats how I buy all mine now.If they had gone this route Xbox Play Anywhere would also have come to disc based games so we would have been able to go buy Halo Wars for  in Tesco and get it on PC and Xbox One It would be like that because in that alternative version they had planned even games bought on Disc were digital games licensed digitally at the end of the day.That will come about eventually either with the loss of physical media completely or in the way they originally intended. I really think they were ahead of the time with the ideas though and people werent ready for it. As digital content becomes the default with the younger generations I think a system like this will eventually be accepted.With that system in place its possible they could have introduced lending of digital games to friends and other cool scenarios that they seemed to have planned.It didnt happen and if we want digital content we have to pay inflated prices or wait for a sale a couple times a year in the end it worked out way worse for those who prefer digital but better for those who want physical media. Id guess as time goes on those who want physical media will reduce in numbers and eventually.

11134461,0,t1_deu2d04,You seem to be misinformed about the local PS Remote Play. It doesnt use Internet when you are local the PS sends out a connection to have things connect to it so the Vita connects to that connection. The connection is local resulting in buttery smooth connection with no input or audio lag present. The only issue would be you cant be too far away from the console itself or you will get those issues but this shouldnt be an issue considering you arent going to be going around the corner or behind a wall while playing online unlike the Vita since it showed video and audio. I personally have played entire games online and single player on my Vita using my PS and PS remote play with no issues locally. Considering the smartphone app only has to worry about audio and not video this shouldnt even put a dent into the connection since it would be local and only have to worry about audio.There is a way to do it online on the PS but the Switch wouldnt do that since it would be local there would never be a reason to do it online unless they plan on releasing a smartphone app that would go online and connection to the Switch online and let you stream games onto the phone so you can play on the go.,NintendoSwitch,deu2wpe,1,t5_3h47q

This is their first system that can do this now add  years of Technology advancements with the rate the world is going now we will have the console of the century with the Switch . Or the SwitchU or the Switchi Switch  something.If at any point the Switch or a future Switch becomes a hit everyone is done since the handheld will be your controller kids will go mental if they see others around them have it.As is said above if they lower the price and at some point in the upcoming years there will be an insane effect on how fast its going to take over the whole market.More importantly almost every good game that came to PS  XBOX had their PC release aswell and the PC is just the best home console.I expect this console to do extremely well but I do also think this will be in the upcoming years and not right away.Nintendo seems on track with their games like really really next level stuff coming to us these exclusives are so good its not even fair the new Mario and also if we get the New Monster hunter game. ,NintendoSwitch,deuac0f,1,t5_3h47q

11139763,0,t1_deu9vpc,Well many security jobs dont require experience to get in. Its usually only skilled security which generally requires experience. Many security jobs though are entry level and can be obtained by pretty much anyone. The industry actually has a very high turnover rate because it is often used as a way of moving between jobs. For myself while I had security experience when coming into this company I was recommended by my brother when he was working for it. His recommendation got me a job as a guard at the local UPS. After about  months I was offered my current position at the local water plant. My payhour when I started at UPS was . and now its .. However this company has also hired people off the street with no experience for this same job. If you want a job in security just go to the usual job websites Monster LinkedIn Craigslist and just look under the security tabs. Most of the time its low pay but third shift jobs tend to be very lax so it has its benefits. ,NintendoSwitch,deuoiuc,3,t5_3h47q

11143743,0,t1_deuh49k,I dont think you deserve downvotes your opinion is your own. But Im a highly critical devils advocate kind of guy and I found this game to capture the exact magic of exploration the original Zelda did.My gripe is that the official dungeons have been so far while mechanically sound and innovative pathetically short. I beat the Goron dungeon in  minutes and the Zora one in less than . For only having  main dungeons that is absolutely inexcusable. I think they used a lot of their dungeon resources on  puzzles for shrines. But those mini puzzles dont make up for a lack of a proper dungeon.Beyond that Ive had a blast. I dont really see them as fetch quests like you call them because in a lot of cases you arent given a location to go to. A lot of MMOs and open world games tend to give you the exact location of your quest objective whereas most times these side quests have you finding things through exploration and occasionally luck.

11150350,1,t3_5z6k0g,Personally I believe its due to the fact Nintendo fans are always ganged up by every other gaming community. It seems the overall pattern works like this PC communities hate on all consoles equally while Playstation  Xbox hate each other but agree to hate Nintendo more.Meanwhile Nintendo fans generally dont care what other communities think.Granted every community has their zealots but for the most part Ive found Nintendo fans are much more relaxed because theyre here to play games not compare Teraflops.,NintendoSwitch,devvp2a,1,t5_3h47q

11151871,0,t1_devoccw,I agree wholeheartedly.Before the Switch released I desperately craved a Skyward Sword remake.  I especially craved all those quality of life improvements they made to Windwaker HD and Twilight Princess HD.  Shorter tutorial less verbose companion shorter chest opening animations gutting some of the more repetitive segments etc.Now that Ive tasted Breath of the Wild I can scarcely imagine going back to how Zeldas used to be.  Youd have to really entice me into a Skyward Sword HD release.,NintendoSwitch,dew1whf,1,t5_3h47q

11152408,0,t3_5z0dvn,I want the pro controller Zelda and the switch and that kind of adds up... When I can get a switch for  maybe used and Pro controller for less than  Ill probably go for it. Ive owned every portable Nintendo console iteration going back to the GBC so Ill definitely get this but I got my DS used in great condition for  with  games  years ago and while that was a bit after launch it was worth the wait for the deal for my gaming needs even though I wanted that on launch too. I love the idea of Switch I just dont quite value it at  maybe if the graphics matched the PS. I think the portability brings the value of the Switch to equal that of a PS for me but I could get a PS for  or  if I was really looking I can definitely wait for a bit of a price drop.A lot of people seemed to have issues with their launch switches I assume they will return them and Nintendo will refurbishresell them for less like they have for their other consoles. Might be when I then get one. Hoping before christmas!,NintendoSwitch,dew43gu,1,t5_3h47q

I tried various combinations of taps and touches as I browsed the newsfeed and the eshop then I launched Whippersnippers and was stuck. I had to powerbutton to sleep then rewake and close software to get back to the homescreen. How cool would it be if totally handheld you could softcontrol select titles? Seems able for sure.

11166981,0,t3_5zekxr,I got one this time for a friend. But I did the Walmart preorder a couple weeks ago. Heres my experience with Walmart and what happened in the previous preorder thread Last time I preordered Wed  was supposed to be delivered on release date Fri . Ended up shipping Sun  delivered Tue . Nobody really knows what Undefined status means. I was undefined by x date for days before the progress moved to Shipped and even then the date got delayed. Not sure what ended up happening for shipping vs instore pick up orders but I think there was a diversity of experiences. Walmart didnt even know what was going on. A bunch of people asked online chat when they would expect their order yet each rep told everyone something different. However they were very courteous and gave a discount if request nicely. Inconvenience was a sufficient reason to ask because everyone was supposed to get it on the release date thats the point of a preorder no? They did seem to do it by order i.e. who bought first gets it delivered first this was about  hour window of preorders,NintendoSwitch,dexrklk,2,t5_3h47q

Be the console that gets you out but also fits the party person. With such an indie flux into the gaming space I am greatly looking forward to better game design and play with a few steps back on graphics and the  standard game price to not be true for all Switch games.

Stuck my Switch in the dock immediately after installing played the hell out of BotW and havent had the slightest issue with peeling bubbling whatever.I strongly urge using the hinge method. Place the protector exactly where you want it to go dont remove any of the backings then either use tape or the little stickers amfilm includes in the package to create a hinge so the protector is in locked in perfect position. Then flip up the protector check for any rogue dust particles and either air duster them off or brush them away with the cleaning cloth then remove the protector backing and stick it down.The key is making sure its PERFECTLY aligned before you do the final peelstick. If its not perfectly aligned remove your sticker hinges and reposition. The amfilm protector is the exact perfect size to have the tiniest little edge border and if its off a little it will overhang off the bezel and not stick properly allowing air to get underneath which might be a source of many peoples issues.,NintendoSwitch,df01rqf,1,t5_3h47q

But Breath of the Wild has attracted so many of my friends who dont care for Zelda at all. The game is much more appealing to people outside of the fan base while still being Zelda. I think it carries virtually the same appeal to people as the Elder Scrolls games.  I think the series is going to be remain open world going forward.

11197039,0,t3_5zukca,Actually Im wondering if what youre seeing may be the LCD redrawing itself.  I see this often on more modern LCD screens for Nintendos system ever since the Game Boy Color really.  They all seem to kinda have these very faint scanlines that you can see if you jostle the screen around a bit and try to look at it.  Its especially pronounced at night or in a dark room for me on backlit screens and on the GBC and original GBA its most visible playing in direct sunlight.  Its not that there are lines missing from the image entirely.  Just that it appears at times where every other line is slightly darker than the others.I know some people arent able to see it but Ive always been able to.  I just wonder if its a difference in my eyesight from a lot of other people combined with how LCD screens redraw pixels on the screen or something which is silly since its an LCD and not a CRT but I digress.  For me its not really distracting but it is noticeable on occasion.,NintendoSwitch,df165tm,3,t5_3h47q

You are in a level called the womb daddy whats a womb?  and you do fight a boss called Isaacs heart daddy why is there a heart in the womb?.  there are enemies that are you but with blood pouring out of their eye holes.  Yeah its all cartoony but that doesnt change that it IS all this stuff. Yeah if someone asked me to describe Isaac those arent the first things Id bring up but ESRB ratings arent based off the best case scenario theyre based off the worst.

11216368,0,t1_df3230t,Your opinion is as valid as mine but Id say the opposite  Switch is a good game regardless of price.

I just feel like the game is actually worth it.I have a theory on why  Switch has been badly reviewed. Ill probably do a write up on it soonish. The price factors in but its not the only or even the main reason I think. The main reason is that its not a video game and should not be thought of as a video game but yet its sold as a video game.,NintendoSwitch,df3d188,2,t5_3h47q

Of course not to downplay the issues that some people have been having there are always going to be some defects especially with a brand new console.  So far I havent heard of Nintendo support being unwilling to repairreplace consoles when these issues come up such as left joycon signal drops or dock scratching.  If you buy a console with defects its covered under Nintendos year warranty.  Theyll even extend your warranty so thats its a full year from the day you receive your repaired console back.,NintendoSwitch,df6pncq,1,t5_3h47q

Sony killed the Vita by allowing crappy versions of AAA titles onto the Vita killing interest.

If you check the night before or early before your target opens and it shows stock available theres a good chance itll be available if you go early enough.  From personal experience going  hour before the store opens is a good bet YMMV.  Target usually updates stock around pmmidnight but also sometimes early morning around am.

11275477,0,t1_df9nnon,Nintendo have a lot to learn about nonlinear storytelling.Im not a huge fan how most of the story is  years ago and the number of times they use that exact phrase instead of alternatives gets really annoying. Where it really falls in my opinion is the side quests. For the most part its the typical Zelda thing of the world falling apart while everyone is living like everything is fine... most people just want you to fetch stuff for some random thing and nothing has any real impact on the world as a whole. The biggest change Ive seen so far through completing sidequests is a girl in Gerudo town now grows wildberries. Its basically at a point where it may have been more effective to have no towns villages or even many NPCs at all and just tell the story through a bunch of writings scattered around the place.,NintendoSwitch,dfa24sw,1,t5_3h47q

His joycons take a little more strength not much at all just holding down the unit to slip off.I think I was prematurely worried as well I may have a defect but after going through these it looks like the original scalped ones I bought are fine and Im returning the gamestop bundles.I figured For the week of me having mine  people used mine and I used the joycon grip quite a bit so my joycons have been in a bunch of things and my brother has mostly been playing on TVhandheld on his for a few days.Anyways sorry for the long reply but thanks for responding! I feel like this is just normal at this point. Doesnt bother me while playing at all,NintendoSwitch,dfblp78,1,t5_3h47q

Ive unplugged it from the outlet a total of one time so far to move it from my upstairs bedroom into the living room where its been for the past two weeks or so.Certainly no contact with water. No contact with pets. Truthfully no manipulation of any kind given that its plugged into a power strip behind my PC. Theres plenty of space though so the area isnt overheating. It worked fine a few days ago but when I went to dock it there was nothing. I tried the power brick on a different outlet one on a different circuit and still nothing plugged into both the Switch directly and the Pro Controller. Its just bizarre. It just sort of died.

11295309,0,t3_60swil, No. Some games can be purchased and downloaded i.e. World of Goo and the library is expanding but at the moment no. I would recommend World of Goo though. Its a puzzle game but pretty much universally liked. Id highly recommend I am Setsuna based on your interest in the FF games. Yes but we arent paying for it until fall. Its free until then so they can test it and work out the kinks. I believe it will be year. Each month starting in May? will have a retro game playable for that month for free. Put simply Nintendo makes videogames so people can have fun. Their graphics arent usually as up to date but its obvious that they handle their IPs with care and love. Thats how they can keep making games like Zelda and Mario that are timeless and coming up on  years old for the franchises and still going strong. Theres also usually a lot of opportunity for local multiplayer with Nintendo if youre into that. Just whether or not Nintendo is right for you. Most games youll play will be few in number as nintendo values quality over quantity. The big games youll buy will always be a blast so its a quality investment. Id recommend downloading some old emulators for GameCube N and SNES to play some nintendo games for free before buying. The best research will be more experience with their games. I recommend the followingSNES Legend of Zelda Link to the Past adventure FF rpg Chrono Trigger rpgN Super Mario  adventure platformer Golden Eye  FPS Pokemon Snap .....idk what to call it.

11305726,0,t1_dfd8deg,Spinning our wheels a bit here and weve gotten way off tangent. I dont see either of us ending on the same page but to unpack a bit hereI dont think the Switch will be any different in that regard. It will get some sort of FIFANBA K this year but judging from comments from publishersdevelopers they wont be on par with XPS. I havent seen too many other rd parties talking about bringing games to the Switch but I imagine it will be the same. Either scaled down versions or theyll skip the console entirely...not unlike the DSVita.As for replacing my DSWii UVita I think you misunderstood my intent. I meant that I anticipate Nintendo will drop both their consoles and consolidate to just the making st party titles on the Switch and that niche Vita games will make there way here as well. I play my DS Vita and Wii U way more than my PS and X. But that has more to do with my tastes in games than anything else. My Vita gets more love than my PS and my DS gets more love than my Wii U. Just the type of gamer I am. They dont need to replace my home consoles they already get more love than any of my current gen systems do.And yes the inherent disadvantages of being a portable console come from its lack of power its price and its lack of multimedia. The rest of that paragraph is just conjecture on your part. It would also kill off the hybrid nature of the console and further stymie rd part support by splitting the userbase. As for your final point I again think youre downplaying the experiences that were offered on the Vita and DS. Titles like Resident Evil Revelations offered home console type experiences. Games like MHU were on both Wii U and DS. The Vita has many titles even retail like WoFF that released simultaneously on PS and Vita. No one disputes that these are portable consoles. They are. I feel like the Switch absolutely is in the same category as them it just came out  years later so its the newest and most powerful portable. But at the end of the day its absolutely a portable console. Not the first not the only just the next one. It just so happens to come with an accessory to plug it into your TV in the box so they can call it a hybrid. The rest is just marketingsemantics and hats off to Nintendo it is working. ,NintendoSwitch,dfdhjo5,1,t5_3h47q

Much more modes in the full game then then globaltestfire.Also to be fair it feels like you REALLY boiled the game down into its simplest form. I mean theres a reason why theres a pretty big competitive scene for Splatoon. When you first play its basic. But if you take the time to explore the game and its functions instead of basing your whole review on a beta.Let me give you a example real quick.Overwatch was literally just grab the objective shoot the player hey you lost haha next game. rinse repeat. I dont understand why people enjoy this game at all.Again any shooter can literally be explained by that one false sentence. If anything Splatoon is DEFINITELY the most unique out of all shooters.Then again maybe youre not just interested in different types of shooters and want to stick with the regular formula.

Even with the screen protector off or on I doubt it wouldve made a difference as it being bent there was no way around it. I tested it and slipped my switch in and it was hitting the rails leaving scuff marks from the rubber on the bottom of my screen. So I thought about asking Nintendo for a replacement and couldnt find out how to email them their website is confusing. Decided to call as thats the best option but found comments from other people stating you can just heat the plastic and bend it outwards. I used a hairdryer set it to be hot and stuck a book in the dock for a couple minutes. Then placed it against the insides of my fridge to cool it down.

Nobody else is doing anything similar or as unique save for the Nvidia Shield and that family of devices. Emulation may appeal to a niche group of people but for the vast majority of Nintendos customers its irrelevant. Remember when the GBA slot on the DSi and the GameCube ports and GC disc reader on the OG Wii were phased out?

11327370,0,t3_61kqre,Honestly theres too many words so let me just share my experience. When I first connect to my internet I have both .Ghz and Ghz connected to both of them. I went to see the difference in speed so on the switch menu it allows you to test the connection. I ran it for both the . and  to see how fast each one was in download speed and upload speed. The Ghz download . Mbps and Upload . Mbps was two to three times faster than the . so I picked that one.Ive only gotten to play the Splatoon  test fire yesterday and it ran perfectly fine for me. I was using a pro controller too so I think Ghz seems to be a safe bet when playing the game. It could be possible that during the beginning when you disconnected a lot was just because the servers were having problems then were fixed later on as this was a stress test after all. If you can pinpoint the switch or pro controller as the problem maybe give a call to Nintendo and see what they can do or if they have heard of anything similar happening.,NintendoSwitch,dffxsrf,1,t5_3h47q

11340370,0,t1_dfgqx2y,I dont know much about the DSi system but it sounds like theyre discontinuing support for the system itself... it also sounds like if someone had previously transferred their content to a newer system theyd still have access to it going forward.gt Note that even after the Nintendo DSi Shop closes most Nintendo DSiWare will continue to be sold in the Nintendo eShop on systems in the Nintendo DS family.    I actually find that pretty impressive actually. Not only could you download your digital library to the device and have it available on demand in your pocket but you could buy a two gen newer console and play titles from across the platform and the other legacy VCs too... and even stream some media too though I never have. Considering that Nintendo is typically regarded as catching up on this front I cant say I lack confidence in my digital libraries futures.  In the case of the DSi there was the argument of things only being released physically... but the opposite of that is true so far at least in NA for the Switch.. and hardware wise Id personally expect the Switch to age more like an iPad than a DSi... and theres also a risk of the next gen Switch ditching physical media like PSPgtPSP Go note I dont actually think they would... but theyre also not going to discontinue digital distribution. The Vita went back to physical as an option but I dont know how well that went... and its still not playing UMDs... it does however play digital PSP games plus PSone classics and whatnot.,NintendoSwitch,dfhetcv,0,t5_3h47q

Maybe another one only a month out from launch? Then its a great purchase! Otherwise just wait a couple months until there are a few games youll like but dont pretend that if there are no ga es you like at launch then its a waste. Just enjoy whats out that you like and wait for more games to come out. I dont know maybe its just me but I dont buy consoles super often. I bought the switch because itll last me a long time. Its portable and a hybrid. Its got lots of neat hardware. And Ive always enjoyed Nintendo games more than any other game. Plus I know that for every console they will almost always come out with a Mario a Zelda a Mario Kart a Super Smash Bros and a bunch of other creative and fun stuff.

Its pretty representative of Edmunds sense of humor I think.gtI think the opposite it is very unique and the reason the game has stood out even to this day.You can think what you want but from my own experience and from the many people who have posted on this sub the motif is very clearly a red flag to a lot of people that are getting hung up on it.  It is certainly unique though.gtFor you.Perhaps youre not getting what I mean when I say dumb.  I dont think dumb is necessarily bad.  I can think a game is dumb and still have a big ol smile on my face while Im playing it.  I would even say Gungeons motif is dumb but a different kind of dumb from Isaacs.Regardless of your personal opinion on it Isaacs art style and themes come up in every conversation about it because theyre highly divisive.  This controversy surrounding it gives ammo to people that say its just riding on an edgy art style or that its trying to appeal to  yearolds and stuff like that when in reality the reason that game is played so much is because the game itself has incredible depth.  But the people who are against the art style tend to refuse to try to approach that depth.Of course I know one person that likes it specifically because of the motifs it uses but I know far more that dislike it for those same motifs.,NintendoSwitch,dfkhsyd,1,t5_3h47q

It has the item variety and unlockables of Isaac though not quite as game changing and zany with a deep almost turn based style strategy.

When you file your income taxes youre supposed to claim any purchases that were made out of state and no tax was paid.  For example living in Massachusetts we are supposed to declare anything bought in New Hampshire where theres no sales tax.   of the time its a complete nonissue and unless you buy something major like a car or a boat.  ,NintendoSwitch,dflzl70,2,t5_3h47q

11448692,0,t3_63b72i,Ive been playing both docked and undocked in roughly equal measure.

I had expected it to be the opposite. When undocked the joycon are usually attached to the console but Ive also done tabletop mode on occasion. It might depend on the game being played Zelda is my only reference so far but my only real preference is for split joycon when possible.

11449846,0,t3_63fnqf,I loved the shrines and I loved how they were sort of grouped together by region like you were more likely to find electricity puzzles by the desert but I really wished theyd taken it a step further and changed the decorating between regions. While I really liked the stark starry look of them it would have been wonderful if there were themed shrines instead. I would have loved some Forest shrines by the Lost Woods for example.Also I sort of found the Divine Beasts disappointing. Loved everything that went into boarding them but once you were inside it was just figuring out how to make the thing bend to do what you want.

11456503,0,t1_dftqkzs,Yeah Im  and my wife are so so happy weve decided not to have kids. We can travel we play video games we can go out to eat without having to eat at family friendly places or finding a babysitter we can go out at night we can live as selfishly and hedonistically as we choose. Were going to Europe in a couple weeks we just got back from spending a month in St Lucia wouldnt be able to do that if we had kids. Were constantly asked when were going to get started on that family like its the greatest goal in life and depending on how earnest the person asking is I usually say something like kids are dirty and selfish why would I want to ruin my fabulous life?. Thats not say I dont understand why other people enjoy having kids but the social pressureexpectation to have kids and the assumption that having kids is living the dream or that its an essential life experience is absurd there are perfect examples here in this thread. The minute you say something about why you dont want kids or that you think having kids would ruin your life a bunch of people have to chime in like youre talking shit about their life choices or their kids.

11457436,0,t1_dfukn0e,By adding a fan you add more RPMs. You are still increasing noise because you are adding a fan. The two are related. So as I said both statements are true.The thing you are failing to grasp is that increasing RPM just like increasing the amount of fans does not ALWAYS increase noise.If you have a high quality fan running at  RPM and a horribly low quality off balance fan running at  RPM the  RPM fan will make more noise because it isnt balanced. It will vibrate considerably more and cause more noise.Adding more fans will not ALWAYS produce more noise but it can. Increased RPM will not ALWAYS produce more noise but it can.Both statements are true and false depending on the circumstances. As a general statement though increasing rpm amount of fans and quality will in some cases this is implied cause more noise. They will not ALWAYS cause more noise.You are doing nothing more than nitpicking about wording.,NintendoSwitch,dfuoxmi,1,t5_3h47q

Adding upgrade options and nonlinear progression i.e. complete levels in any order might be good though..  Take the mainline Pokemon games where youre a trainer and make them open world  that is dont confine the player to routes and make it possible to do all the MacGuffin collection i.e. gym badges leading up to the final challenge in any order the player decides.

11465196,0,t1_dfvji5y,Lets be honest though the odds of a playable character outside of Link are slim to none. It would be pretty neat but I would be shocked if it happened so I dont bother speculating around that. But the reality is we know way too much about  years ago to warrant exploring that further. How Zelda got to take pictures with a slate isnt exactly something to make story DLC out of. We know what happened to Zelda after the shrine she went to fight Ganon. And how her father died isnt exactly a big deal in the grand scheme of things and wouldnt be sufficient on its own to use as a basis for DLC. The ending of the game lends itself to a post Ganon Hyrule for the DLC. I could be wrong but I just dont see enough of a reason to go for the prequel. On top of that the DLC description on Nintendos site says that the DLC is a new original story so that makes it even more unlikely that they would revisit a story they already mostly told. ,NintendoSwitch,dfvkn83,1,t5_3h47q

Theres a difference between Nintendo fd up and I dont agree with the industrys amount of acceptable variance for this product.Nintendo Fd up would be a year from now having switches burning children who fall asleep with them in the back of the car a la Galaxy phones. Nintendo fd up would be having more than their allowed defective rate of units bend like taffy.  If . of units bend like taffy and those  units show up on every media outlet its a bad day for Nintendo but its STILL not a Nintendo Fd up situation.  Shit happens for all companies on assembly lines.  Bad press is inevitable when that happens.  You have to make a choice as a for profit company between making a nearly flawless product and making an affordable product.  The more finicky the electronics the more you have to reduce expectations for perfect batches of product.Apples has sent chip and screen makers into bankruptcy because the third party companies couldnt make large enough batches that had good enough parts to meet their standards and the way Apple wrote the contracts the risk was all on those third parties.

At the very least constant charging would be bad for the batterys health.Most modern devices with rechargeable batteries are actually between  and  battery when they say . It is not energy efficient or good for the battery to keep it constantly topped at  so devices like your phone or Switch are designed to charge to around  then let the battery drain a bit to the  range then charge back up ... and repeat until you unplug the device.People dont like unplugging a device thats been charging all night and seeing that it hasnt fully charged  so the software is designed to show you  even if you caught it at the end of a noncharging cycle and its closer to  than .All that said I think your issue is probably just a software issue with the way the battery is displaying and not a hardware issue with the battery or power adapter.Its probably not a serious concern but it doesnt hurt to talk to Nintendo about it.,NintendoSwitch,dfy142v,3,t5_3h47q

Seemed a bigger risk in Saidaioujou which is meant to be played from start to finish. There are shield refill pick ups you can earn in GEM which is the closest thing to a power up. And another thing in GEMs favor for me is that while I normally play a shmup for survival because Im too garbage to play for score this one I play for score since its your score for a given level that matters not an overall score. Im still crap at it and cant get a decent score to save my life but maybe Ill do better than my  year old nephew which is good enough for me. ,NintendoSwitch,dfycg9j,2,t5_3h47q

And make a new profile your the person you are selling it to make them auto log in and they would have never known that there was a second account. Plus they could still play all your games. I sold my Wii U with my digital library. At a slightly lower cost then if they were physical and it was a friend of a friend type situation so I didnt mind having my account on the console with everything removed on the account billing wise. I was lucky in my situation as I was prepared when I bought my Wii U and knew that my digital games were tied to the console and that my digital games could potentially be worthless. ,NintendoSwitch,dfzegsw,1,t5_3h47q

11519048,1,t3_64eho7,I dont think its close to  either.  Its an  at best.  The elements that they took out are what makes a Zelda game a Zelda game.  The world just feels so empty and theres really just a whole lot of nothing in it.  The combat is easy unnecessary and it can be avoided  of the time.  Zelda and Ganon dont even feel like part of the game.  In previous ones they were introduced early in the game and had larger parts too.I think that the people who overpraise BOTW and cheer the the changes and open world really never wanted to play a Zelda game in the first place.  ,NintendoSwitch,dg1op1n,1,t5_3h47q

11520790,0,t1_dg1ulrv,Every device with an X throttles down to the Switchs stock speeds in long gaming session so its not like Nintendo is pulling a fast one. The battery is already the majority of the Switchs volume if you look at a teardown and there is not space for more battery without making the device bigger note the iPad Mini is a bigger device. Finally even if you are right and its a  boost per watt that doesnt cover the X gap in power between the undocked Switch and an Xbox . If Nintendo added faster memory or more CUDA cores that would greatly increase the cost not allowing them to hit a  price point. We have no clue what Microsofts next console will cost but it will for sure be more than the Switch.In conclusion your analysis is based on wishful thinking a lack of understanding of how mobile SoCs work and throttle and an axe to grind against Nintendo. I have provided sources and clear logic while you make claims like the Switch can fit more battery when it clearly cannot.

I know folks gravitate toward the City Slicker from Waterfield but I prefer something slimmer  I dont need protection from dropping it on the ground just a stylish sturdy case to carry the thing around with. ampnbspAnd thats exactly what this case is. Especially in waxed canvas its just a beauty. I hardly adds much size to the Switch though the pocket gives enough room for two extra JoyCon straps cables games or what have you. Really impressed by the little touches like the furlike main compartment lining and the yellow textured fabric inside the accessories pocket. Granted this thing is pricey  in comparison the PDP case was lowpriced and totally serviceable but feels definitively cheap in person and doesnt look quite as nice as it does in photos.ampnbspBetween this and the awesome industrial design of the Switch itself being a nerd at the airport looks a whole lot slicker than it used to.

11552969,0,t1_dg5h9oa,I brought it to a bar to play with some friends. Its a boardgame bar where youre already going to be playing tabletop stuff anyway so I thought I could sneak in a few stages of player Snipperclips or a few games of  Switch in between Codenames DiXit or Lords of WaterdeepIt was a blast. The neighboring table didnt ask anything about it maybe they were shy or totally nongamers but my friends loved Snipperclips. We were playing when one of the guys from staff saw it and went whoa is it... the Switch?! Im in Brazil. Its RARE to see anyone with a Switch. I never saw anybody with one except for me and I live in the biggest city in the country.He started asking a lot of questions brought one of the chefs from the kitchen to see it. I could see they were uncomfortable about asking to play it so I offered for them to play Ball Count one versus the other. They were completely dumbfounded at the HD Rumble in that. Like they almost didnt believe that was even possible. We played a couple more  Switch games and that was it. Short experience but very cool. Another day I was interrogated at length in an UberPOOL by a girl who I was sharing a ride with. I was playing Zelda during my trip when she was picked up. She did a fairly funny double take when she saw what I was holding! After that she started making a lot of questions like where did I buy it whats the battery life etc and wanted to take a picture with it. The whole time she was texting her boyfriend who was the one actually asking the questions through her. EDIT I thought this was only about playinginteracting with strangers but if playing with a group of friends counts I need to say I had an amazing time playing  Switch with a group of friends last month. Initially it was a group of  people we played exclusive  Switch for at least  hours. Then three more friends joined in. We were ready to drop the game but when they arrived and wanted to play everyone was ready to play more. We played several rounds of Team Battle and it was cool that while not everyone enjoyed every game there were always at least one person on each team that was excited to play whatever game the Switch threw at us. Baseball was definitely the one that less people wanted to play again were in Brazil. Youd be hardpressed to find one person in a group of  that knows how Baseball works. Ball Count and Safe Crack were interesting at the start but towards the end people always wanted to play the more physically active stuff. Plate Spin almost had us breaking stuff in the house. People literally fell to the ground during that game and the houseowner had a face of terror everytime this game was played. After we got tired of playing me and two other friends kept playing Quick Draw to devise ways to get better times. The best we had was . after we had the breakthrough that you could press the trigger with your thumb instead. People love to talk trash about  Switch but its a fantastic game in the right setting with the right people. It really doesnt appeal to serious gamers for some reason but its the best local multiplayer for groups since Warioware Smooth Moves. ,NintendoSwitch,dg5j6ny,15,t5_3h47q

11560210,0,t1_dg6a7fb,Negligible and significant are indeed opposite ends. Insignificant and negligible are after all synonyms. Negligible means that something can be ignored for a given purpose. It does not mean unobservable and a specific observation can be extremely significant given one context but entirely insignificant in another.When talking about a controller that sees  hours on a battery for you seemingly  for others and compare it to a controller that seem to consistently see several days between charges then a  hour is indeed negligible. It is not unobservable but it is insignificant and negligible given the scale and context. For a silly analogy If youre talking transportation then a walking speed improvement of  is negligible when cars are defining the scale.As for the specific thing about multiple LEDs You could get the same amount of light from a single LED but it would use considerably more power. What matters is just how much light comes out and how filtered it is. In our case its a lot of light and very filtered diffuse but that there is more than one LED reduces the power consumption.As we both know that were having a silly friendly argument I have no objection to engaging in it. ,NintendoSwitch,dg6crf4,1,t5_3h47q

For the most part its either ignore the feature or shoehorn something in.But where something is designed specifically for it the result is amazing.  NintendoLand had some good examples.NSMBU had boost mode where one player generates blocks for other players to use but the game is designed to be  playable without it.  SMDW had touch enemies to freeze them in addition to the environmental things that responded to touch and how you could punch blocks throw balls and collect coins by touching them but for the most part that felt shoehorned in as almost everything can be done without it and ultimately are more about touchscreen gaming rather than twoscreen gaming.,NintendoSwitch,dg6n16s,1,t5_3h47q

11611390,0,t1_dgbytmj,It depends on two things. and most importantly can we make enough money to justify development on this platform. This is the top line. This is why the Nintendo DS got a GTA game. THE DS. Its because it sold like crazy and Rockstar who normally doesnt work closely with Nintendo decided to release China Town wars to tap into the enormous base they were missing completely. How easy would it be to port. A lot of publishers want easy situations where effort can be sidestepped while still making some nice margins. There are people like Shinen motivated by their craft more than people like EA and its subsidiaries. They achieve really nice results because theyre good developers and work hard at it.If some developers can crank out great looking well playing games on a system and others cant its not a hardware problem the common denominator is the effort level of the developer.,NintendoSwitch,dgc5t6p,3,t5_3h47q

11628220,0,t1_dgcxhsn,yeah thats exactly me right now i MK was the first Mario Kart i really got into and i loved it online was fun and when cc came out i was addicted to it like no other racing game had me and the tournaments that were held on the Mario Kart subreddit were really fun and some had rewards if you were the weekend winner. Just wish my roommates were good at it so i can play with them one of them just isnt as good as he used to be and gives up but thats beside the point.Yeah really loved and looking forward to MK online is fun and just a fun game overal to always want to get better and beat your own records just to try to be the best in the world online i cant wait !!! ,NintendoSwitch,dge2knj,1,t5_3h47q

11629959,0,t3_65w7zk,Is the charging LED on the pro controller supposed to go off once the battery is full? I just got mine and it was   when I started charging and the light is still on.EDIT For anyone interested the charging light did eventually go off. I think the pro controller just charges slowly through USB I had it charging off a USB port on the Switch dock.,NintendoSwitch,dge9o7v,1,t5_3h47q
11630842,0,t3_65w7zk,Double Edit  Switch is officially dead. No longer boots no matter what I do  times and the times it does it freezes within a few minutes even after initializing it again.EDIT  I think the dock might actually be overcharging it because I had it off in the dock and it did the same thing. It also felt hot. Now that Ive had it off the dock it has cooled down and runs no problem. Its also fine while docked and on...super weird.So Ive learned adjusting sleep times while in Dock can potentially break your system. I made a post about this in last nights thread. I wouldnt risk putting your Switch in a Never Sleep state while docked. Mine seemed to overheat pretty hard and just seemed to get hotter while off the dock. Hard Resetting gave me nothing either. The only way I fixed it was by letting it stay off dock for around an hour and hard resetting over and over I got a Nintendo splash screen for half a second each hard reset and then it would shut down. After trying endlessly it came back on and seems to be fine now. ,NintendoSwitch,dged9xg,3,t5_3h47q

Not to mention flippin git around for the countless advertisements Mario has been in Got Milk? the Olympic games and yes Mercedes just to name a few.

It makes sense  devs need to make more per sale when the console has such a small install base and if the market theyre targeting is more likely to pay the necessary higher prices it makes sense to charge more. It isnt great for early adopters but if you have a spare  to throw around on a console with not much on it yet it probably isnt that big of a deal to spend a bit more on the games for now. ,NintendoSwitch,dgfe6v4,1,t5_3h47q

11653546,0,t1_dggvq0v,I agree. The Switchs chances for success are as a DS replacement. The sooner Nintendo retires the DS the better for the Switch. Its just that the DS is still bringing in good revenue or so I assume.gtIts a handheld first to many people. That is why you are wrongNo thats literally your reading comprehension failure. My claim is comparing the Switch as a home console not a handheld. gtyou cant compare a switch to an xbone the same way you cant compare a DS to a I just did. And so did dozens of paid game reviewers. Nintendo bills the Switch at least partially as a home console. In that regard its a last generation home console. Theres no question about this at all. Someone wanting a home console that is as powerful as current generation home consoles will be disappointed in the Switch because its last generation. The tiny handheld screen be damned because that screen is primarily for portable play. Nintendo learned that lesson with the gamepad.,NintendoSwitch,dggxzp0,1,t5_3h47q

If they hid stuff away people would post complain about having to reunlock stuff in a yearold game when they just want to play with their friends. If they made it an option or synced with Wii U data or whatever people would complain that its confusing or that their little brother hit the unlock everything option on them.I think I might care more if the unlocks in MK were actually tied to accomplishments. In MKWii some characters wouldnt unlock until you got at least a onestar gold trophy in specific cups. In MK they were doled out randomly upon getting trophies.,NintendoSwitch,dgks2ym,2,t5_3h47q

And dont apologize for the rant maybe some current or perspective parent will read it take it to heart and their kid will end up happy and successful rather than just another name in the local papers crime blotter. Maybe thats a bit of an extreme example but these days Im not sure how far off the mark that would or could be. I was ASTONISHED when my little monster was just a few months past her second birthday and could already figure out how to unlock an iPad mine and find YouTube videos of Elsa from Frozen singing Let it Go. Over and over and over. These days she gets  minutes of iPad time every night right before bed. I watch with her the whole time and the stuff she is into these days is pretty innocuous people opening toys claymation and music aimed at her age group if I have to hear the stealing sugar no papa song again I may need to run toward the nearest living thing and kill it. We had some issues with her wanting to watch a few channels that werent just criminally stupid but a definite bad influence. I put a stop to that though probably not as quickly as I should have. The bottom line is this The parent in me just wants to raise a smart healthy nice little girl with good teeth and a good education Lisa needs braces!. The lifelong gamer in me just wants to keep her as far away from shit games as humanly possible despite any peer pressure. The punk rocker and metal head in me hopes she isnt into shit music as she gets older and the former drunkjuvenile delinquent in me will be happy if she isnt as big a dickhead as I was in my late teens and early s. ,NintendoSwitch,dgmhifc,1,t5_3h47q

Do other console manufacturers do the same?And for   Other smart device manufacturers produce more than one product at a time for good reason  they serve different markets. Nintendo obviously thinks that for the time being there are different markets served in the early adopters of the Switch and the huge customer base for the DS. No doubt theres a good chance these markets will merge in the future and Nintendo may eventually discontinue the DS but for the time being they presumably think that its either more profitable to serve both markets or that its cost neutral as well as being good practise to not abandon your customer base.,NintendoSwitch,dgq2y8r,1,t5_3h47q

11745501,0,t1_dgrbria,Youre thinking a bit too one dimensional I think. I likely should have clarified.The Dark Souls of Switch doesnt mean you take Dark Souls and put Samus in it. It means you do whatever method you feel best suits the play style of the game youre making whether thats first person or third person and crank the difficulty up.Its very possible to have difficult encounters at long range. Doom did a pretty good job at this. When you cant rely on melee damage you rely on the boss using AoE attacks to hurt the player. Use a system similar to BOTW where you can create ways to interact with the world magnesiscryosis and make those have a purpose in boss fights. Make certain boss abilities BE a one hit kill.

This issue seems to prevent a reconnection to the wifi especially if youre not close enough low signal strength.Why the hell do you have an open and unsecured WIFI at your home?

If youre loging in via a captive portal the browser popup would be quite normal but it should redirect you to your routerprovider login page where you log in and then gain access to the internet.A captive portal is usually used for public hotsports you connect to an open wifi and then youll be redirected to a specific login page where you have to log in or purchase time first or whatever the conditions are.

11749694,0,t3_67mm4z,Im inclined to think that the big unannounced game for the Switch is Animal Crossing. Theyve got only Mario Odyssey for the fall and time are ripe for a new mainline AC game. Plus its a perfect fit to showcase the Switch real strenght play at home play anywhere we know they already have the unused HD assets from the Amiibo Festival spinoff and theyve got the mobile game to further push the IP. If they play this right AC is going to be a system seller for the Switch especially since it already is like their th more popular IP. Of course theyre going to talk about the upcoming already announced games maybe announce a couple of big AAA multiplats coming and theres definitely going to be some Monster Hunter since they came out every spring my guess is  for DS and Switch.Then VC for the Switch is guaranteed since they have to finally present the paid online oh I do hope they streamline their confusing and redundant account systems wasnt this the point of My Nintendo?.No SNES classic because if its coming theyre going to announce it closer to Christmas. Finally my last guess are Pokemon DP remakes for the DS. This is a rather controversial opinion since DP are technically playable on the DS and this goes against Game Freaks first rule for remakes butThe Munchlax event reminds me of the Torchic event we got for XYThe new movie is going to feature a Piplup and a Lucario and the pokemon anime is generally a good indicator of where the franchise is going The pokemon centers in Japan are featuring a lot more Sinnoh pokemon latelyThe whole TypeNullArceus plot Ultra dimension and distortion world are kinda the same Its an easy last push for the DS since they can recycle assets from SM and the story is obviously already done since its a remakeAnd so on. I know that all of this its patternwork and headcanon but its clear that while main development has switched towards the Switch and by the end  thats going to be their only console its clear that Nintendo is not ready to let go of their  lower entry point into Nintendo consoles just yet. Third party support is still strong and the DS library is impressive. I do think that all Nintendo franchises are going to migrate to the Switch eventually yes even Pokemon which will be the Switch biggest system seller and a key factor in the console longtime success but Nintendo and especially GF are not ready to let go of the DS just yet. So yeah here are my two cents. ,NintendoSwitch,dgruvbd,4,t5_3h47q

11779200,0,t1_dgv6it9,No matter what you think E is not going to have the reach that other channels will. Its popular yes but not broadly popular. Nintendo isnt trying to capture only the captive gamer audience they are reaching wider than that. An E event does not have the reach that they want. Its a marketing decision and its not a bad one. They are choosing to spend their timemoneyefforts on other things to try and push awareness and sales in other ways. Its not a black and white one or the other kind of thing marketing is a very complex mixture of a ton of moving parts. Boiling it down to one event does a disservice to the marketing efforts of Sony MS and Nintendo. Taking any one event as indicative of the performance of any of the big three companies is a faulty premise period. Just because MS and Sony do something does it mean that Nintendo should or that it will have the same or similar impact or effect  thats also a faulty premise. Adding a third company doing the same thing could have a significantly less impact for Nintendo and Im sure heir market analysts have told them exactly that. Just because YOU dont like it doesnt mean a lot more other people also wont like it. They are trying to cast the widest possible net. In doing so some things will slip through that net. Maybe in this case you are one of the ones slipping through the net. ,NintendoSwitch,dgv7kb6,3,t5_3h47q

Marketing is about efficiency and not just how many people can be reached. You can reach every person if you spend enough money but is it worth it? No. The amount of money that goes into an E event will not return the kind of sales that Nintendo wants. It wont be reaching the kind of people that Nintendo wants. Just because E can reach more people than a direct doesnt mean they are the right kind of people. In talking about MS and Sony you did make my point  two companies doing the same thing and it did not work for one of them.

11789693,0,t1_dgwd30e,The Switch version of Zelda has more sales than the Switch itself. No doubt its going to stick around for a little while especially with the DLC trickling in through the year. Thatll keep interest fairly high in the game. I think by the time Mario comes out it wont be so  for Zelda and Switch after Splatoon and MKD. But its going to keep going for a while I suspect.MKD in particular will have good legs. I dont think its of any real concern to Nintendo or Switch owners that its basically a souped up version of an older game. Playing it again today on Switch reminded me that it truly is the best Mario Kart and the battle mode fucking rocks. Im pretty set with Mario Kart on Switch. Id buy DLC though.I think for sure theres going to be more rd party stuff. Like you said all the Japanese devs seem on board.

Western development is a mockery of the field due to its corporate structure. Annual products are more important and lucrative than timeless products so why perfect them.
