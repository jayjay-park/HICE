7476672,0,t1_d2s1lou,Very true. Which is another reason I get so sad.Apparently when I was two or so I alerted my mom to an otter in our backyard that was dying. It just had a soda plastic holder thingee around its neck. My mom got the thing off and then the otter fled. Id like to believe that he survived but from how my mom explains the inflammation and infection I highly doubt it. ,ReversedRescueGIFS,d2s1zfg,3,t5_38c43
