11638664,0,t3_65zq67,This is great Im a huge sucker for characters that look like theyre actually prepared for adventuring.That is they actually have a backpack or a sack slung over their shoulder that could feasibly hold basic supplies like food extra clothes or even just tools of their trade.Its a detail that so often gets forgotten especially in games and films. Characters who are supposedly on day or week long trips into the unknown but all they wear is pristine plate armor and they carry no extra supplies at all.,ReasonableFantasy,dgf97t1,4,t5_3i7g8
