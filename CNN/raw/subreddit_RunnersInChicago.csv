1238699,0,t1_ci8yo57,Thanks for the input. Im going here because   It is covered by my insurance and  I want to see if I need to have any of the ligaments repaired. Im not super into physical therapy considering I can still run. I just need to know if this pain I feel is serious or if it is something that happened because I am getting older.,RunnersInChicago,ci8yxe0,1,t5_2uw3t
1295684,0,t1_cietfjc,yep. Checked people in and once the race started I ended up being a backup time person. I entered peoples bib number as they crossed the finish line the oldschool style of race times as a back up in case the chip time failed for some reason. Pretty hard to do since people had a tendency to hide their bibs on their backs and sides one guy had his bib on his back underneath his tshirt. Also hard to keep track of numbers when groups of people crossed the finish line at the same time. sooooo Im thankful that the chip time didnt fail. Otherwise I would have  athletes angry at me.,RunnersInChicago,cifdqi5,2,t5_2uw3t

1967180,0,t1_ckq67wa,Being in the first wave also gives you the advantage of having more time to run before the sun starts to heat everything up and cook everybody on the course. Its especially noticeable around mile  as the course turns west and there are fewer tall buildings around to provide shade. The further you can get before the day heats up the better youll feel in the long run.,RunnersInChicago,ckq8vnt,4,t5_2uw3t

A quick warmup is really hard to adjust to especially in terms of hydration.  If you can get out there  a couple days early that is a good idea.,RunnersInChicago,cnhwgjn,3,t5_2uw3t

8215797,0,t3_4rj3oq,Nailed the first week but the last three have been meh.  Not too shocking as it has mainly been scheduling issues.  Feeling a little ran down but not sure if that is due to said scheduling the heat the extra cross training or dropping weight dropped almost  moving bf from high s to low s.  Overall good though.  Think I am on pace to set a PR at .  Get my mileage back up get some good tune up races in get some longer tempos and Ill start thinking faster.,RunnersInChicago,d54j2nv,1,t5_2uw3t
