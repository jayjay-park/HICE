They do not particularly care about the universe nor are they necessarily totally aware of any of the things in it. They are not sentient beings in any way that we would that we would really think of.  Fragmented beings pieces of old gods. They wander the universe fairly aimlessly leaving a trail of their divine power in their wake. They are immensely powerful and dont particularly care about life in the universe. They are more like old gods than people.  True gods seven beings created by the old god of life. They shaped the universe into something that could be lived in and then created life. They care about the universe and life in it because they are personally attached to it having created it. They are more like people than old gods.  Ideal beings beings created through the worship and belief of mortal beings. They are living embodiments of ideas and ideals. They need to be worshipped and believed in to take in power. There are hundreds of them as any religion that gets enough followers eventually becomes true. They care very much about the universe and life in it. They are more like people than true gods.  Lords of the Seven Hells created by the true god Bator when he created the Seven Hells. They are basically ideal beings that dont need worship but are also as stuck in their own worlds as mortals. They can also be killed. They care sort of about the universe but more in a I want it way than a I want to protect it way. They are more like people than true gods.  Cult deities and ascended beings cult deities are basically baby ideal beings. They have just gotten enough worshippers to start existing and are starting to try to work their way up. There are many of them.  Ascended beings are mortals that have earned godhood through either peoples worship of them and an amazing deed or through the divine will of a deity or rarely through magic.,ImaginaryBestiary,d9owf3h,3,t5_3hear
