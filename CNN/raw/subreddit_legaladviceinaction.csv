7970718,0,t1_d4bz8mp,Thats a great question and I wish I had a concrete answer for you.My impression based on like  minutes of clicking around is that the main LA sub has used CSS to hide the other discussions tab although Im guessing that can be circumvented by people who use RSS and opt to hide custom CSS. From what I can tell BoLA and LAOffTopic still have that tab enabled in which case yes users will be able to see our discussions as long as theyre submitted as links.,legaladviceinaction,d4bzfrr,10,t5_3eyua

8137997,1,t1_d4uq101,I actually think the conversation should have gone a completely different and possibly more productive direction with Opening up with a location and all of the different cyberstalkingharassmentrevenge porn statutes passed in the last few years.  Not jumping to federal govt prosecuting someones iCloud violation.  I have been posting the CFAA sources on a few replies and another sub. If you google CFAA and SCOTUS  or  you get so much feedback your head will explode. gtAlso what do you mean by bullying? Where in the U.S. could someone ever successfully sue an anonymous user or a service provider for someone being mean to them on the internet?There was a long drawn out argument in my house about this the last few weeks related to other rulings. I am not getting into it here because I dont totally understand it. ,legaladviceinaction,d4usmqs,0,t5_3eyua

8256427,0,t3_4sh170,Ive only played for about half an hour but the doduo that turned up in my living room could also be caught from the street in front of my house without setting foot on my property.  Now if the property was larger... but then to trigger it to turn up out of reach you might already have to be tresspassing?  Im sure there are potential problems see the police station thats a pokestop but the radius of pokemonstopsgyms seems to be large enough that you can usually reach them from public sidewalks. ,legaladviceinaction,d59lz3i,11,t5_3eyua

And I do hope that Niantic takes businesspeoples requests to have their property removed from the game.  If they open the submissions back up its not like thered suddenly be a decrease in the number of stops and gyms there are plenty of other businesses who would jump at the chance to have a stop put up so they can attract customers who are playing the game.,legaladviceinaction,d5am4ft,4,t5_3eyua

8359042,0,t1_d5meznq,I have nothing against the advice or the comments in the original thread the ONLY thing Im mad about is the overly optimistic title here. Just delete the last two sentences in the titles.In your agency if there is no good solution do you pretend everything is great or do say something like unfortunately this is the best we can do?Again the advice itself was great. There were multiple viewpoints there were alternatives emotional support there were no nasty upvoted comments but and this is big but this title makes it sound like OPs problems were almost solved and he only needs to get his daughter from the home to the embassy. ,legaladviceinaction,d5mfkoa,3,t5_3eyua

If you look at the reactivity rating which refers to how likely it is to react and start a firedetonation it is much higher second highest in fact with things like nitroglycerin being the highest and gas being .

8685869,0,t3_4ysp3k,Man I dont know what to fucking make of this one. Ive been homeless like that and its fucking awful. Slept in some cars and bedroom floors of friends and wound up on a trust fund kids couch for six months. The drive to do anything just to avoid actually sleeping on the street is a strong one but OP couldve just let her stay there without fucking her. The first night I totally get it. She threw him off dont care had sex whatever. But that followthrough was just evil he knew she was fucking him for shelter. And then keeps going even after learning shes homeless AND pregnant. This woman was better off in a shelter and I hate saying that. ,legaladviceinaction,d6rcza7,13,t5_3eyua
