7833961,0,t1_d3wg0oe,To continue with the wolf theme WLVEFRST Wlfe and Wolfbastard are all worth checking out. Googling these bands to find the bandcamps again has made the word wolf look fucking stupid...,crustpunk,d3wlslz,5,t5_2sl9u
8551175,0,t1_d6abxr1,Its either every June or July. The bowl bash should be pretty easy to find online. Dont go unless its the bowl bash my understanding is they dont really like people who arent involved just showing up off season. Super fucking worth it though. Waking up to some bigass skin cutting the roof off a car with a sawsall then driving it around blasting a flamethrower out the top...I was home. ,crustpunk,d6agx1u,1,t5_2sl9u

9392910,0,t3_597zhv,I think it is both as many have said but I think it leans more on its punk roots for iconography imagery themes and politics. Metal is the medium but punk is crusts soul. ,crustpunk,d96m99k,3,t5_2sl9u
9428251,0,t3_59oew3,Amebix and Doom as far as UK goes Nausea and Disrupt as far as American crust goes. I know a band like Disrupt may not have created influence on the level of bands like Amebix and Doom but their sound is a good example of American crust in my opinion alongside with Nausea.,crustpunk,d9b3gd6,1,t5_2sl9u
