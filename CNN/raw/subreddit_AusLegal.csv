7953289,0,t3_4o6ja4,Hullo uEngineerman!The lease should contain a right to accounts.  If it does not then the obligation to pay outgoings simply applies according to the leases terms.  So if it says certain outgoings must be paid well they must be paid.  You seem to be questioning whether there is a current entitlement to proof of the amount apparently being sought pursuant to the relevant clause. Save for an express term in the lease no there is not.  But that said no Court would sanction a defendant for simply asking for evidence of an amount claimed before they were willing to pay it.  The opposite is likely true  demanding  without providing at least something to support its calculation and maybe also refusing to do so when asked would likely be frowned upon. How to handle it?  Politely request calculations of the amounts owed plus supporting evidence. One final point  the  months is almost certainly irrelevant.  If the lease says outgoings are payable and the landlords just forgotten to charge them for a few years that doesnt affect the obligation to pay. ,AusLegal,d4a0w37,0,t5_2zqu2

8509044,0,t3_4w8r2s,So how did they get entry to the property did they have permission to enter of not advise the cops because of they were injured in any way it could come back on you. I would also contact your insurance and advise then of the illegal entry and damage done to the property youll also need to go and secure the property.Speak to your lawyer if they only do conveyancing then they are probably fairly average anyway. You may need to seek guidance from another solicitor.,AusLegal,d656pdr,3,t5_2zqu2

11658410,0,t1_dggofhk,Im not  on this but Im pretty sure that where you are has a caferestaurant licence to sell alcohol. That would explain the primary purpose to serve food. Once food stops being available the premises is not longer a caferestaurant its just a bar. And that requires a different licence. This has nothing to do with RSA and is something that should have been explained to you by your boss. ,AusLegal,dghhudh,2,t5_2zqu2
