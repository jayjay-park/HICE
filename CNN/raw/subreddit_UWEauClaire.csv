10802213,0,t3_5ufyzq,I am a sophomore Communications major from Eastern Minnesota. Some things I like about UWECThe surrounding area of Eau ClaireI think its a really cool city and I  love the surrounding communityThe food in Davies isnt that bad and could be a lot worse.Its a beautiful campus Putnam Trail anyone?Blugold Radio . and TV are super coolSome things I dislike about UWECGeneral disconnect between administration and what students really want.Distribution of funds to unnecessary projects Re Garfield Ave Construction instead of allocating funds to things current students need How about computers that work or even free laundrySodexo doesnt know how to make a pizza rightLower Campus parking is an absolute nightmare so much to I will avoid driving so I wont lose my spot.The Communications department is an absolute mess I went here not wanting a CJ degree but changed early my freshman year. I regret coming here for my chosen degree because of the incompetence within that department.General education classes taught by an extremely passionate professor to a huge lecture hall of disinterested students. Overall I like the city and want to live here but find the administration incredibly frustrating.,UWEauClaire,ddu6782,3,t5_2scuo
