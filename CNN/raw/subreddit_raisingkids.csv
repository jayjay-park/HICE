For others choosing a stuffed animal or bedtime music.My oldest used to frequently request drinks of water.

I work predominantly with kids and the behaviours just get worse the longer theyre left untreated.

Sometimes this upsets the child to think of being treated in a bad way but its necessary sometimes. I was working with a family of three boys and the middle boy was talking about how his younger brother never leaned anythingyounger brother is  and after he wasnt acknowledging my attempts to stop his mean comments about his brotherin front of his brother as well I said  I understand it feels like that but Im not okay with us talking like that about your brother just like I would be okay with older brother talking that way about you and he got a bit upset I think because he may have realized he wouldnt have liked that but I dont know for sure. Ive used this many times and sometimes it doesnt work but I turn the situations around a lot the  year old said something like I dont ever want to listen and I said sounds good Im never gonna listen either and the.

2841991,0,t3_2smr7a,i have to say im not shocked that the kids were called in  the world is home to some sociopathic assholes hiding behind their curtains looking for people to baselessly report to the authorities. those people have always existed.  and im not terribly shocked at least at the initial response of the police  when a call like that comes in they can sigh but then they are obligated in some sense to take a drive over there and maybe ask the kids a couple of questions.  if the answers they get dont sound quite right news flash kids dont always tell the truth then taking them back home to their parents is certainly an appropriate response.where things go off the rails is when Montgomery County CPS gets involved.  who in the hell at the station house thought this interaction merited a call to CPS?  i expect the fundamental problem here isnt that some asshole called the cops assholes always have or that the cops showed up they should when theyre called or even that the police exercised bad judgment  but rather that there is no room for the police to use their good judgment have a laugh with the parents about the kind of person that called them say have a nice day and let that be the end of it.  the cops are obligated to file some report to keep the paper trail of what they do and a procedural condition of them having a reported child interaction is thanks to some overzealous childrens rights legislation that was im sure well intended to place a call to CPS.  tick those boxes or get a disciplinary hearing.CPS then has to do its thing  which because of the nature of their work is going to involve trying to get the real story out of the kids when mom and dad arent around to intimidate them.  chances are the CPS folks who have seen real neglect a few times one can be fairly sure know very well that this is bullshit but they too have their procedural boxes to tick to remove the jeopardy of personal liability.in the end what you have is less a breakdown of social trust under the weight of a runaway cult of incredible narcissism at the neighborhood level and more a buildup of the cult of procedure.  its no longer possible for people in official positions to simply exercise their good judgment and some common sense in ignoring a call reporting these kids  everyone has become intolerably accountable thanks in part to the cult of liability itself an outgrowth of that same cult of narcissism and in part to the Age of Data in which everything is recorded and nothing simply goes away.,raisingkids,cnr4rlk,29,t5_2tb3h
3092970,0,t1_cnxjht2,The issue with punishmentbased parenting is that it does hurt the child and that it does not teach the child WHY. It is a very old approach and creates a lot of unnecessary trauma without offering long term benefits. It cripples the parentchild relationship erodes the trust and causes a lot of issues including the possibility of aggression and diminished learning ability. It is very very old parenting technology the equivalent of using buggies for transportation and blood letting without sterilization for medicine. Yes it was used on many people and they turned out OK  where OK means without visible defects apart from the common belief that it is normal to use physical and emotional violence on children.

I realized it is not useful answer but this is my honest sentiment.I am father of two we are raising them with my wife. first of all it is so much work one parent would be very very unhappy also short on money. yes I know you can overcome this by help of parents or you may have saved some money but you wrote you are also working hard on your career?secondly we complement each other with my wife. she is more into arts handcrafts etc. and I am more into books games sports... two persons can give kids more impulses.and then there is my intuition and common knowledge and stuff and I dont want to go into that because there are surely more educated people here on reddit but I think that for happy and balanced kids you need father and mother with their love and full attention. I know many people have been raised otherwise it can be done. but why do it to your kids why risk their mental wellbeing...yesterday when reading your post I didnt see your exact reasons but maybe you can wait till there are right conditions for you to have kids in a loving relationship or to be around the kids as a great uncle or great teacher children doctor or else...good luck with your life.,raisingkids,cs9cos5,1,t5_2tb3h

You can see the sheer energy in the playground of boys and to a lesser extent girls racing around because they no longer have to walk three miles to school. Yet they get about  minutes between carseat and school seat to release this huge energy.I dont think its really to do with modern classrooms though discipline is far far reduced from a few decades ago which has both benefits and disadvantages. Sitting at a solo desk with a teacher thwapping you over the head with a book still happened in my day  albeit only with an softcover exercise book! if youre doing something wrong is a world away from sitting at a shared table with other kids and teachers with no discipline options than a yellow card.  I can clearly remember how we pissed around in table classrooms vs the isolated desks of the older fashioned stricter teachers. Years later its those stricter teachers I remember and respect.And a report card system isnt discipline its a record of failed discipline.

My parents did this to me and it took a lot of big time failure in order for me to undo it as anecdotal evidence. But like uFalsePretender said theres plenty of evidence to back this up. However its important to note that sometimes this is rephrased as praise effort not the result. Thats incorrect the studies show we should still teach kids to succeed just make them understand that it was because of their effort whether that was practice that gave them skill or long hours studying that gave them smarts.

I did find this other articlegtThe FDA is investigating reports of seizures in infants and children who were given homeopathic teething products which may contain natural compounds but are not regulated as drugs by the FDA.gt In  the FDA issued a safety alert about a homeopathic teething tablet that contained belladonna. Belladonna  also called deadly nightshade  is a poisonous plant that contains a chemical called atropine. At high levels atropine can be deadly. In homeopathy it is used to treat redness and inflammation.gtAt the time the FDA found that the teething tablets contained inconsistent amounts of belladonna. The company that made the tablets Hyland subsequently recalled the product. My impression is that there have been reports and they are investigating but since there is no evidence to support these products helping and since they are unregulated the safe thing to do is to discourage their use.,raisingkids,d8cnqil,3,t5_2tb3h
