She takes the glass from his hand and touches it to his with a light tink. She swirls it in the glass and inhales deeply first and then the barest touch of a smile brushes across the corner of her mouth like a moths wing before she straightens up and downs the drink as well. By the Emperors bootstraps that burns! She does her very best to keep her face still but her eyes begin to water a tiny bit as the corner and she takes the barest sip of water enough to ease the burn while acting as if this isnt at all a concession.In response to his question she pulls out the same calling card a small square of thick cardstock with ink matching her lipstick. The card reads Ms. Alyce Ann Gregorai Institute of Chartered Financiers She also pulls out a pen and writes another name on the back. She slides the card across the bartop to him. The name on the back reads Aleksander Gregorai  an arms dealer from Rusand who was well known and wellconnected among the underground world. She watched his face carefully any hint of recognition would give her an idea of how hot the fire shes playing with was. She takes another sip of her water and leans up against the brass bartop trying to make the height difference between them less noticeable. She reconsiders laughs low in her throat and then lumps indecorously onto the nearest barstool.,hostsresplendent,dg9us0n,2,t5_3jkn1
