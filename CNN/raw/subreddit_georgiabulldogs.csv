5313827,0,t1_cvq27y6,Goddamn. I knew thats why we need to fire Richt but I didnt known his record against good teams was THAT bad. That sucks lol and this completely answers the question. ,georgiabulldogs,cvqwjss,2,t5_2wws3
5590111,0,t1_cwpuuqo,He hasnt been a head coach yet. If he proved himself as a HC maybe.Just because he comes from the Saban tree doesnt always mean hes going to be the next Nick Saban,georgiabulldogs,cwq07sw,1,t5_2wws3
5602756,0,t3_3rtgtl,Im predicting another ugly win a la Missouri. I think we pull it out but not without continuing the Fire richt discord. Its really a loseloselose situation. We either win big and yell about how we shouldve done this in previous games win close and say its not good enough or lose. Losing will make an already hot seat down right incendiary. I dont know. I hope its an easy win but seriously doubt it will be. As all dawg lovers echo heres to next year!!! Hail Eason!.. Hopefully. ,georgiabulldogs,cwrkqns,5,t5_2wws3
5873074,0,t3_3voxjb,I hope this doesnt mean that ADM will keep him from hiring whoever he wants as OC and DC if ADM really wants us to win a National Championship than give Coach Smart what he wants and needs! ,georgiabulldogs,cxphpof,3,t5_2wws3

10278063,0,t3_5n1kzb,Something to keep in mind a lot of these are probably verbal offers and not official offers.  What really matters is if a kid has a committable offer when he is ready to commit.For example Aaron Sterling.  If he wanted to commit to UGA today they would tell him to hold off.  He would need about  other guys holding offers to pass up on accepting their offer to attend UGA at this point.,georgiabulldogs,dc92owf,1,t5_2wws3
