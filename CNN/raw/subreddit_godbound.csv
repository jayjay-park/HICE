8511024,0,t1_d5io244,gtA character with Might Endurance Earth trying to buy Excellence of the Word Dex and one of the AC  gifts not so much.Force  Mass  Acceleration. He might not have divinelypowered superspeed like someone with Alacrity might but I could see a Mightpowered Excellence of the Word Dex working. Theyd just be a lot more likely to leave collateral damage when moving fast than someone with Alacrity would  shockwaves shattering windows the force of the footsteps shattering the road and leaving craters behind them and similar things.,godbound,d65fngv,1,t5_3d2a4
9007789,0,t3_53dqsn,The reason Might gets a  Strength and the other Words dont has largely to do with how Strength works at the table during play.Physical qualities are easy to portray in superhuman fashion. They tend to be expressed in forms that are easily broken down into hard numbers you can lift X pounds move X feet per round take X damage before going down. Intellectual or social qualities are much more difficult to convey convincingly. Its easy to imagine playing a character who is stronger than any normal man but how do you play a character who is smarter or more insightful or more charming than any normal human being? In the case of the mental or social Words like Knowledge or Passion I could give people specific tricks or abilities they can trigger to simulate that kind of ability but for momenttomoment roleplay its very hard to account for all the ramifications of superhuman mental traits.So that explains why I didnt give mental stats that holistic boost but why not Dexterity or Constitution? Each had their specific reasoning.For Dexterity its because Dexterity already runs the risk of being a combat godstat. It improves both AC and attack rolls and while AC isnt as critical in Godbound as it is in traditional DampD its still an important stat. If you let Dexterity have a  attribute mod it becomes the Best Combat Stat period whereas allowing Strength to have  while capping Dexterity at  leaves optimizers with a real choice to make. Aside from that Dexterity is the goto attribute check for any physical action that doesnt revolve around physical stamina or muscular power which is a very large field of potential. You make a lot more Dex checks at most game tables than Strength or Constitution ones.For Constitution its because its boring. A  would give you  hit point per level and be the leastcommon physical attribute check roll. The peripheral benefits of superhuman constitution are better packaged with the Word itself as explicit perks no sleep no food needs et cetera than left to be inferred to a  Constitution.,godbound,d7ulfnw,4,t5_3d2a4

9873112,0,t1_daues0y,Theyre easily refluffed if nobility from other lands have transhumansupernatural gifts as well. I found the Five Families section a useful guide for making PC backgrounds and lineages matter a bit more. Essentially each Family has a minor bonus and an attribute requirement plus two common legacy talents that are weaker than a lesser gift costing half a gift point each and a heroic legacy talent thats about as strong as a lesser gift. So if your PCs have a background that they want to bring into play in a major way they can pay two gift points.The rest of the other sections in the book are also easily repurposed. My favorite is the Great Orders of Knighthood. They show the full scope of power that a Fact can have. So every time my player gets a Fact I look here and judge it against the examples in the book. The players Fact needs to be just as useful.,godbound,dauhncx,1,t5_3d2a4
10731177,0,t3_5thxzm,They all do stack.  This is balanced by the fact that a Shattering Hand and Cutting the Crimson Road are both greater gifts thus greatly limiting a Godbounds gift selection and b that CtCR doesnt affect worthy foes and only very low level lesser foeshalf your level or less HD.,godbound,ddmu9xy,3,t5_3d2a4
11773853,0,t3_5wt8p0,We have tried implementing some old school spells per the recommendation on page .  Its mostly fine.  One problem is that there are certain classes of effects which are treated as nothing in base DampD but are settingdisrupting in Godboundparticularly scrying teleportation summoning and resurrection.   Arguably these were also problems to some extent in DampD too.,godbound,dgulmmq,1,t5_3d2a4
