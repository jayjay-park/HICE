7134957,0,t3_4d79zw,Past Ive been trying to change lifelong bad eating habits since I was about fourteen years old losing some excessive weight bit by bit in the process. Recently deleted a weight loss account Ive had since I was seventeen or so. Gahh Eating well and taking care of oneself didnt seem to be important in my family and while growing up.Present mindset I am slowly acquiring the right attitude towards food and I think life in general. Health is now of major importance to me and I am very grateful to be able to take care of my body and mind the way I want to. I am a vegetarian a runner and a yogiI never call myself an overeater or binge eater because I find it helps sustain wrong thinking patterns. I am a person who is treating her body as a temple and Im trying the best I can.Super excited to be sharing this journey with yall! Good luck everybody!,TeamThunderstorm,d1p5zjj,5,t5_3duv4

7274852,0,t3_4f02gb,My gosh darn shorts fell off while I was washing the car last week and my previously super tight yoga pants are so loose I tripped on them in the grocery store today.,TeamThunderstorm,d253oho,7,t5_3duv4
7306717,0,t1_d28l47b,Yes thank you. Im keeping my mind off it. A setback doesnt mean I have to give up forever  I find that when I eat a big enough meal to satiate myself for lunch I dont need to think about food until later. Have you considered having an even bigger lunch? I literally eat two or three different things for lunch  maybe greek yoghurt a soup banana and peanut butter a healthy salad  so I have lots of different things in my body and lots of different cravings hit. I feel subconsciously ilke Im having three different meals all at once just by having a little of each of those. For example a big late breakfast might be a small bowl of porridge a tub of greek yoghurt a slice of toast and a banana with peanutbutter. Thatsn ormally around  calories but I feel like Ive eaten so much just by eating small amounts of lots of different things  like I really feel like Ive binged out Ive eaten so much!  that I dont feel any cravings until dinner where I eat again  ,TeamThunderstorm,d28q2uq,1,t5_3duv4
7494098,0,t3_4i0c0t,Maybe this is lame but...I chose to take both of my zerglings to the grocery store this morning and get more food for lunch now rather than scrounge or get fast food for lunch and save the grocery trip for later when I could go alone. Sure it was good to get us out of the house but my main motivation was healthy foods. Made it out in one piece too.,TeamThunderstorm,d2u1ewh,2,t5_3duv4
7546374,0,t3_4ioasx,This may be unpopular but my solution to my tendency to snack in an unhealthy way was to stop snacking completely and make sure I eat proper meals instead. So I have three meals a day and only have water or tea in between them. It means that my meals are larger and I feel very satisfied after them. It also stops me from waiting until pm for dinner because Im hungry for it!,TeamThunderstorm,d2zzi6i,2,t5_3duv4
