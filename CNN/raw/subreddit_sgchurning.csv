10145142,0,t3_5l4dkv,I think you should consider turkish airlines or Asiania airlines. You are in an ideal scenario to keep your gold status long after you stop flying to USA. Both are star alliance partners so your gold card will be recognised by SQ. Its really hard to maintain Star Alliance Gold on Krisflyer. Check this link,sgchurning,dbtwz2h,1,t5_3hzmw
