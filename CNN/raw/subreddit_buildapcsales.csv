Razer especially uses cheap keycaps doesnt have a metal backplate and doesnt use costar.  And they tend to cost just as much as expensive brands.If Im spending  bucks on a keyboard I want the best.

159424,0,t1_cerdmw5,While many find monitors an excellent medium to receive output from a computer I prefer to stay disconnected from the bright glare of light protruding from the screen and allow myself to focus on other sensory stimuli it provides us.There is the sound the soft whir generated by several fans as they push air about the case calming my soul as if I were hearing ocean waves gently rolling up and crashing on to the beach.  The cool air flows across my feet and sends a chill slowly up through my spine as being sockless provides no protection from such an attack.  The breeze then lazily makes its way to of a stack of papers laying about beneath my desk causing the edge of a sheet to playfully dance up and down. As I slowly drag my hand across the keyboard the sound of clickityclacks can be heard while the ends of my fingers experience the mechanical force of each individual key extruding back from the depths to which I had just sent it.  When I depress and then release the button found on the facing of the disc tray I can hear the struggle of the drive desperately attempting to comply with the command it was just given.  Being of a great age and having interacted with several generations of diverse components it can no longer can find the strength and motivation to perform its primary task.  It produces a small thud three times as it attempts to carry out my wishes.  But alas the sound stops as the drive becomes exhausted and finally gives up.  And yet while it fails almost every time and knows that it is very likely to never open again it continues to put forth a valiant attempt at my every request.  It sees that its usefulness has departed and it is now part of a dying breed but continues to put forth a noble effort in bringing honor to its kind.As we can see there is so much more to a computer than just what it provides through its video out ports.,buildapcsales,cewlazi,2,t5_2s3dh

The financial winners here are retailers AMD would be selling at least close to this many GPUs even without the cryptocurrency rush. Wholesale prices havent changed much if at all. AMD wants you to buy GPUs first and foremost and clearly a  x was not part of the gameplan.By Profitable I meant for individual coin miners dropping as you can see in a child comment k on a rig not to mention the huge amount of electricity the  guzzles down in the hopes of making money off intermediate cryptocurrency mining.

I like to lay down and watch tv and have the mouse on the bed with me and when i got this new mouse i had to try many different surfaces to get it to work. I currently have a steelseries QCK mousepad with a piece of cardboard behind it and it still doesnt work . It may just require an extra thick mousepad and im sure it would work fine on a desk. But that aside it the perfect weight feel shape prevents hand fatigue keeps my palm area clear of the surface so when i game for  hours straight it doesnt get sore. If you pay extra to unlock the cores it becomes a pay to win mouse from what i can tell in fps games when you shoot it notices that your reticle is jumpy and will autocorrect it instantly so it stays roughly where it was when you shoot fully automatic. ,buildapcsales,ch8u863,1,t5_2s3dh

Likewise many applications that are unable to be ran in fullscreen or enlarged remain in comedically tiny windows. So an old program running at x resolution will have an area of a little more than on  inches  x  on a  K monitor slightly larger than a playing card . x and .. The HUD for many games doesnt scale well with the enlarged resolution often causing everything to appear as if it were  of the size it should be in FHD. The guys at WSGF did an awesome series of videos showing some of the quirks of different games running in K. Being an NS addict I was sad to see it in actionK is definitely still in its infancy.

1326579,0,t1_ciiulay,Well for most lower end motherboards the integrated audio isnt very good. Its sufficient but not good. At about this price rangethe original  one is where you start to get noticeableYMMV improvement from stock integrated audio chips. They can also offer certain features that your motherboard might not support like Dolby ..I dont know about this sound card specifically but the biggest benefit from a sound card is for driving higher end headphones. High impedance headphones require extra power to drive them. The problem though is that usually you can get much better bang for your buck with buying a dedicated DACAMP than you can with a sound card. High end soundcards really only have a place for those that dont want an external solution for good audio.,buildapcsales,ciiuv99,3,t5_2s3dh
1327514,0,t3_298vqj,Damn. I might procrastinate this and miss the deal. I just bought a cheap graphics card because I think it will run without upgrading my w PSU. I missed a deal for a  PSU that would have given me enough wiggle room to consider a significantly wider range of graphic cards so its kind of ass backwards to buy a PSU after I already ordered my graphics card. However I do plan on building a new PC soon. However Im probably going to get all the parts after Cyber MondayBlack Friday. It most likely will take me that long. Any reason to not pick this up? It will be a totally budget gaming PC build. The only games Im playing right now are LoL Tera Dawngate and my PC wasnt good enough for Dota  but cant imagine that being a problem with anything I build next.  W should be more than I need. Not planning on building with two graphics cards. Not over clocking. Probably going with AMD FX line of CPUs. If anyone thinks I can just wait since at worst Ill see more deals that are about the same that would be awesome. Seeing the prices when I build my pc my graphics card will be around the  Ti from Nvidia. Most likely will get one in around that price range that needs to be connected to the PSU if the extra performance is worth it. SSD HD  GB RAM at most. If this set up may limited my choices on mid range graphics card then Ill probably pass.,buildapcsales,ciiynpz,1,t5_2s3dh

It is slower then TN panels but I personally dont see a perceivable difference when as above they were right next to each other.The perceivable difference in refresh rate declines sharply after around hz.All that to say for competitive read money on the line FPS gaming the VGE is superior.

1699598,0,t1_cjtabu6,i bought the Sapphire r x and so far i love it. I havent had any issues with it. I was able to run every game i owned on ultra p fps. I just ordered a new processor though to finally upgrade my phenom from .Anyway after doing extensive research many reports indicated that Sapphires build quality was pretty good so thats what made me choose them instead. A lot of people did state that the Sapphire card is rather noisy at times in comparison to the Gigabyte but in terms of build quality Sapphire is pretty amazing. Sapphire strictly handles AMD cards whereas Gigabyte handles all sorts of things from Mobos to Nvidia cards alongside AMD cards so this is also why i went with the Sapphire. It appears the Sapphire one also has a MHz advantage over the Gigabyte out of the box. Dont quote me on that but after looking at Sapphires website here and the tigerdirect link i gather that the Sapphire has the advantage in terms of core clock.All in all the choice is up to you. I have been doing very extensive research as i build my pc the past few weeks and this was my conclusion. Maybe it will help you ,buildapcsales,cjteb46,1,t5_2s3dh

1994959,0,t1_ckt3gnr,So from what I read a few weeks ago and yes I probably wont use proper terminology a plant that had a decent chunk of the market had a fire and destroyed their entire stock of RAM. That increased the price as demand was higher than supply at the time. Someone also mentioned that the technology in SSDs is being favored more and more so the technology used in RAM isnt as valued as it was in the pasts. I assume this translates to more than just consumer SSDs and consumer RAM because obviously they are very different and have different uses. Also I think historically RAM wasnt that profitable. I think theres no reason why RAM has to be as high as it is now. I think the plant catching fire inflated prices but demand was still about the same so there was no reason for anyone to lower back their prices. Now they have a much more comfortable profit margin. Sure they can compete in price but it isnt in anyones interest to do that. They might enjoy a short term boost in profits before they become the catalyst of poor profit margins for the whole RAM industry.Definitely not an expert but those are the three reasons I read with my speculation that the prices are also artificially inflated.,buildapcsales,cktlcxy,2,t5_2s3dh

Certainly better than that god awful Razer pad.As for the quality I have the Large version which is quite a nice pad.  Feels good there isnt any extra resistance when moving the mouse nor is there too little resistance.  Its got the same clean look.  The only real downside I have with it is that it rather minimally slides around on my desk as I have it positioned.  Although a simple readjustment and that problem is remedied.

2517551,0,t3_2oh2a6,I stopped doing my shopping with newegg after a couple of RMA incidents. For the most part they honored most RMAs except for the fact that I would have to pay shipping andor get a reduced refund from stocking fee. What ticked me off was when I had purchased a headset from them that included two free gifts. The headset had a very loose boom mic so I returned it not thinking anything of the two pieces of paper which were cd key codes free in game items to some unknown non A title game most likely some mmo of sorts. So I sent the product back keeping the unredeemed cd codes. When I was refunded they had subtracted the cost of the two codes from my total refund which I thought frankly was ridiculous. Amazon or any other retailer has never done that to me before so I quickly called them in frustration. The person over the phone mentioned that I needed to return the two games and he insisted that they were physical cds not pieces of paper. I kept arguing that they had sent me two pieces of paper with cd codes on them instead of a physical item but he demanded I send a physical cd. He then told me to go on my browser and type in the newegg link he was looking at and low and behold the image had changed to two physical cds with the headset in the background. I informed him that the picture has changed within the past couple of days but yet he still pushed on me sending the cds over for the rest of my refund. Frustrated I demanded to speak to their supervisorand or manager. I repeated the entire story to their supervisor whom promptly apologized and simply said that I should send the pieces of paper back for my full refund instead of physical cds...Really newegg ,buildapcsales,cmn6ke9,1,t5_2s3dh

2587462,0,t1_cmw9656,gtIm genuinely curious how often do you have to dust out your case and where are you storing this thing? On the floor? On average every  months. Yes its on the floor and the room is unfortunately overly prone to dust.gtI ask because I have had this case over  months sitting on a desk off the floor and have only dusted it once. The front vent did a great job and it was easy to clean. The insides were barely dusted at all.The front fan filter is excellent probably the best Ive ever seen as far as catching dust but I like to keep my case as dust free as possible since the hard drive bays are all completely full and they are stacked very close to each other with very little breathing room I like to make sure there is no dust impeding the airflow to keep the temps of the HDs as low as possible.gtYou did mention its an HTPCNAS so are you adding extra HDDs?Yes I have  hard drives which certainly adds to the weight but its an mATX board with no CLC no GPU and no add in cards so the weight of the hard drives is slightly offset by the barebones nature of the build.,buildapcsales,cmwbhq7,1,t5_2s3dh

2633723,0,t1_cn21gqo,I have the gs.  I live in a townhouse with a LOT of other wireless networks around and I was sure that they wouldnt work well.  So I got them and did the setup.  They are comfortable to wear though the plasticky material that make up the earcups can be a little hot after a while.  Overall comfortable enough.  As to the other networks I was positive interference would be a major issue.  Ive had them about a month and only one disconnect so far.  I resolved the issue by moving the base receiver a little further away from my desktop.  Its been good since then.Sound quality is amazing as expected.  A massive leap over my old Creative Fataity headset.  Battery life is okay... easy to charge and use.  So yeah they are worth a shot.  It seems peoples luck varies.

2649791,0,t3_2q9i4f,I dont know a lot about storage in particular is there anyone who can confirm if this guy is for real or just talking out his ass?Top comment on the Amazon reviews that might explain quick failure ratesgt I bought TB drives for my Synology NAS Synology DiskStation Bay Diskless Network Attached Storage DSj White. Ive only had the drives on for one day but after reading about all the drives that fail after a few months it seems the problem is the head parking itself every  seconds if no disk activity. The only reason it does this is to try to save power. Each park results in a loadunload cycle. Most modern drives are rated around  cycles. Depending on how your system uses the drive your drive should only have  cycles per day but some these Western Digital drives are reporting  cycles per day. This will surpass the  cycle limit in a few months. You can get the cycles from S.M.A.R.T. or from third party software. Think of starting your car and turning if off every minute  hours a day. Your starter would only last a month or so and then fail instead of lasting for years.gt The first thing I did with my new drives was to run the WDIDLE.EXE utility on them to disable the  second head parking. You can also change the head parking to something like  minutes which would make a lot more sense than  seconds. To use this utility you have to run it from a boot disk at the command line. This means you have make a cddvdfloppy that you boot from and get a command line prompt such as A. At the A prompt type in WDIDLE r to get the current setting mine said Idle Timer is enabled and set to . seconds. After I ran WDIDLE d to disable the timer it said Idle Timer is disabled. You could also run WDIDLE S to set the park time to  minutes. I disabled mine because most if not all operating systems already have options to shut down hard drives after so many minutes.gt Google WDIDLE to research for yourself one site is .... I dont think this utility is still supported so use at your own risk. That said I havent read about any cases of this utility damaging hard drives. The hard part is making a boot disk with this utility on it and booting into it. I cant write up how to do this do your google but I will say on most machines you do not have to go into the bios and change your boot order. Just continuously press the F key Windows when booting and you should get a menu of which drive you want to boot from.gtIn a last unrelated note it seems you can run these drives in RAID mode even though WD says you shouldnt and wants you to buy their Enterprise models that cost more. From my research the TLER setting is only applicable to certain RAID configurations and then only if you have hardware controlling the RAID. Most consumers and small business will have RAID controlled in their software so TLER should be off as it is in these drives but if you do have a hardware RAID controller you may want consider other drives that support TLER. If you want to try experimenting with the TLER settings there is a WDTLER utility available.I really want to get one of these even more so if this is a potential fix for a lot of the early failures.,buildapcsales,cn4gj9n,5,t5_2s3dh

2830741,0,t1_cnppkyv,Benchmarks measure different things and when comparing straight up gaming performance looking at framerates while keeping all settings identical the G goes neckandneck with even the ik. And this is because even though many games say they require a quadcore CPU they dont actually take advantage of multiple cores very well. I know that Assassins Creed Unity requires at least three cores but thats because its written poorly and Civilization V is wellparallelized but I think that type of game is easier to parallelize than most. Off the top of my head Battlefield  is the only major action title that really takes advantage of multicore CPUs well. Then theres the fact that CPU performance isnt a huge factor in gaming anyway ... But youre right in a wayfuture games will undoubtedly take better advantage of multicore support as multicore CPUs become more common. ,buildapcsales,cnpumho,0,t5_2s3dh

2895924,0,t1_cnx9cb7,Yep I have an AMD gpu and got it to work. It takes more effort but its possible.Google lightboost and click the first link that comes up. Then on the page expand Alternate Lightboost HOWTO. Simply follow the instruction until step  since step  and onwards needs you to have NVIDIA so it doesnt apply to you.After you reboot the power button should turn green which means lightboost is on. If not you need to change your screen refresh rate to hz. Lightboost doesnt work with hz. To do this right click gt Screen Resolutions gt Advanced Settings gt Monitor Tab gt Change Screen Refresh Rate to  hertz gt Click Apply and OK.After you do this your screen will get dimmer. This means lightboost is on the power button should also be green. You can then change the lightboost slider on the monitor itself.Hopefully this helps.,buildapcsales,cnx9r9i,3,t5_2s3dh

An GB variant wont help much even at K because you still need that second core.

This goes back to the price to density to failurerate ratio that Backblaze likes to use and in it Seagate often comes out on top!Hard drive failure rates vary by model version and manufacturer.

3732360,0,t1_cqhpk7j,pros gsync hz it can get brighter than my previous asus gaming monitor could get. I feel like im doing better in cs go with gsync on. Games that i didnt really like playing before i owned this monitor like dying light and far cry because of their huge frame rate spikes now seem much more playable with gsync. With my previous hz monitor i was constantly lowering settings so i could get a few more fps and smoother gameplay with gsync i can just max every game and let gsync deal with all the frame spikesdrops.Cons the ulmb feature doesnt easily switch on and off you have to go into the control panel and turn off gsync then switch to hz and then it will turn on. I thought if they built a button on the monitor to turn the feature on and off that it would actually turn it on and off not tell me it doesnt work in hz or will like let me turn it on but not actually work or doing anything. After i was able to get the ulmb feature on it still didnt look as good as gsync in any of the games i tested and since you have to choose to have one on or the other i just leave my monitor at hz gsync and forget about ulmb being there.,buildapcsales,cqhpoaj,3,t5_2s3dh

4492087,0,t1_cswhtw3,Are any of those parts OCd to a considerable degree? If so Id recommend at least the VA unit rather than the VA. That would allow you to hook up your monitor and your computer to the UPS so you have time to shut down in case of a brownoutblackout.I personally used to hold the idea that these things were worthless. Until a brownout hit me and caused my OS drive to become corrupted forcing me restore it using my backup image of the drive on my NAS. Honestly you pay so much to have such an awesome machine why play on the edge where you might cause harm to your computer setup when all it takes is a couple  not even a couple  in this case to have the peace of mind that your computer setup is good in all situations.Also most new PSUs will need a pure sine wave output by your UPS. The EVGA GS is a Seasonic PSU. I can tell you that my XFX BEw which is a Seasonic make required me to use a pure sine wave UPS. When I had it on a stepped and simulated sine wave UPS it would trigger an instant shut down of the entire system during variable load changes because the UPS wasnt compatible with the PSU that I have. Never have had that problem once switching over to a PSW UPS. Please dont listen to utyzams recommendation of those APC nonPSW units. And since this is going to link to him Id recommend him actually try triggering a usage of his UPS on his system by pulling out the cord from the wall going to the UPS and then try triggering any load i.e. opening programs etc..,buildapcsales,cswvyz6,1,t5_2s3dh

If you cant buy it at competitors location why should they pricematch it for you?  From Staples Pricematch info page what qualifies for pricematch  gt We price match almost everything we sell. The item must be identical including model number components and U.S. warranty. The item must be in stock and available for purchase at that price from an authorized U.S. reseller whose authorization we reserve the right to verify. For wireless phones and other items with a service plan the plan provider and other terms must be the same.

4552127,0,t1_ct4ddhg,impedance is just how strong of a signal you need to properly vibrate the drivers that make the sound.anything ohms and lower is pretty standard and most modern devices will power it fine.if youre going well over that you should consider an external power source to properly power them. if you dont it will sound tinny and weak.think of it like...say you have a really large wheeler semitruck but the motor is broke so u need to replace it. would you put a tiny cylinder liter engine in that or a giant liter v? the tiny engine might power itprobably not lol but the acceleration is going to be awful and you wont be able to go very fast.but all of this is just for information  these headphones dont need an amp ,buildapcsales,ct4f2cj,3,t5_2s3dh

I bought  off amazon based on user reviews showing a very fast write speed and when I tested them I was only getting about MBs on multiple USB . devices. I then went to the local best buy and found one that does write at over MBs. I really think manufacturers are not listing speeds so that when they want to they can slip in a lower performance batch and still get away with it. The only exceptions are the top tier products like SanDisk Extreme where they advertise a specific minimum write speed but you pay a pretty hefty premium for it. ,buildapcsales,ctwxb86,6,t5_2s3dh

4806120,0,t1_cu06lw5,That is partly true. But these days games can fill up available memory with data. Gone are the days when most cards didnt have enough power to use the available memory. Think about it this way...even if your GPU core is the bottleneck it still saves the time of loading up stuff in the memory. Similarly faster ram would helps as it would reduce look up time.That being said not all game objects can be loaded into the memory before hand. But games do a decent job with it these days. Try running GTA V on maxed settings on a GB card....as long as you have a decent card the memory will be a bottleneck.,buildapcsales,cu0cnci,2,t5_2s3dh

The big difference is the lifespan of the drives the Pro version is marketed as a more durable drive with a MTBF rating of  hours as compared to the Evos .M hours. So someone is doing a lot of intensive write operations on the drive might want to invest in the Pro drive for the potential life span increase but for the majority of normal users its probably smarter to go with the  cheaper Evo drive like you suggest.,buildapcsales,cu3i0ea,12,t5_2s3dh

4887468,0,t3_3hu9u0,After reading through all of the fluff I finally figured out whats supposedly so amazing about this thing. Its essentially two separate heatsinks with one contacting the CPU directly and the other cooling the hot side of a thermoelectric TEC or Peltier cooler. The cold side of the TEC is contacting the top of the plate thats contacting the CPU. In theory this allows for better active cooling by turning on the TEC when needed. In practice it doesnt work at all. TECs are notoriously inefficient and require many times more power to run themselves relative to the amount of power being consumed by the device to be cooled CPU in order to even cool the device to ambient temperatures. This means that the hot side of the TEC is dissipating all of the heat absorbed by the cold side AND all of the heat that it generates itself from the power consumption. The only effective way to use one on a modern highpower CPU would be to use one rated for hundreds of watts and to cool the hot side with a massive custom liquid cooling loop. In fact companies have tried building similar coolers before. The Cooler Master V was one such cooler. It was enormous. Much larger than this cooler and it still performed worse than a Hyper .

There are times when my brother and friends are in my room to watch football or basketball games and it can get loud and the sound just leaks into my  Annies. As for the sound leak I may choose to bring these to office in the future so I can listen to music comfortable. So Im willing to lose some sound stage and positioning to gain better isolation.These headphones look like a great fit for my main concerns of isolation and sound leaking.

5753070,0,t1_cx9vffl,Actually this entirely is not accurate.Being a seller on a review site such as that you have the option to pick and chose your reviewers. You are also given a type of Amazon history data on how often you leave stars or negative reviews and I am able to SELECT who I want to send my  off promo code to.So tell me as a seller why would I ever send a promo code to someone that has a record of giving an average of say . star reviews on Amazon versus someone that has a record of giving an average of  star reviews? Its really messed up when stuff such as nutrient pills are caught up in this. It really skews the feedback scale. Not to mention it is super easy to bombard yourself with a wave of positive reviews from a service like this to bury negative reviews. So you see for a website that is largely dependent on customer reviews...services such as these are pretty much making them useless skewed results. Regardless Amazon just this week is starting to take actions against these types of reviews They already are stripping them of their verified tags.

GHz k but I have no problem working a web browser text document etc while Im in class.Things can bog down pretty hard if you have a lot of tabs going at once especially if one of those tabs is doing something like streaming video. This laptop is best meant for doing only a few light to moderate tasks at once. For example Ill have RStudio a few word documents Firefox with  tabs Skype and Hexchat running all at once. Itll start to urk a little but its still pleasant to use.If youre looking to game dont buy this laptop. The integrated graphics leave a lot to be desired and I pretty much gave up at trying to find games I wanted to play on it. Apparently it can do a few things like DotA LoL and other stuff at lowest graphics but I would never suggest this laptop to someone wanting to game on it even if only occasionally.Overall its met my needs pretty well. I have a pretty decent desktop but I needed something for the occasional portable task. I dont feel restricted on daytoday usage but I also dont have high demands of it.

I finally got them to give me expedited shipping on what is hopefully the correct replacement and had one rep tell me over the phone that Id be receiving some sort of upgrade. Who knows what that means. However theyre still saying it wont ship until probably tomorrow evening which is pretty freakin ridiculous considering its been a full  days granted only  business days since I notified them of the issue. I would have thought this is something theyd want to correct more quickly but I guess one little consumer is just small beans. I might call and ask theme to see if theyll give me a full  year warranty on the refurbishedreplacement drive also for the trouble. Its doubly annoying because the Seagate TB that Ive had as my other driveprimary media storage drive decided to become inaccessible with multiple unreadable sectors in the space of about  minutes last night. No idea what caused that fortunately it decided to do it  weeks before the  year warranty is out.

Even if they have shitty quality by every other standard you could measure those specifications mean you are not using a bottomofthebarrel projector. Any projector that can do those things is a lot more than .Resolution if the projectors in your school are not truly useless they are probably  pixels. You are trying to read text from them probably which means ultralow res stuff is. Worse than this projector.. Not useful. Brightness I dont know the specific numbers involved and lumens seems to be an easily manipulated measurement anyways. But theyre not going to be pico projectors and theyre not going to be LED type projectors there is going to be a big old bulb behind a translucent LCD display like they did in the old days and still do if you want high brightness. Have a look at the home theater and business projector sections in Newegg. See anything near ? Yes pico projectors that dont really belong in that section and replacement bulbs for real projectors.

6197653,0,t3_409bjr,I cannot find confirmation of what the FreeSync refresh range is.  The range is pretty important because if it is not . ratio from max to min it wont be able to do refresh doubling.  Note the Asus MGQ is similar quoted at hz but only does hz in FreeSync mode.  Luckily enough for refresh doubling but just barely.  Im a bit wary to recommend this one without confirmation of that range.  There are plenty of FreeSync displays with ranges like  which is junk.But hz static is still very good on its own and for the price it perhaps makes sense without variable sync at all. ,buildapcsales,cyu3v1c,1,t5_2s3dh

6654398,0,t1_d07l7sz,Well the stems on the Novatouch are a bit more rattlyscratchy than the ones on the more premium Topre boards. You can somewhat eliminate that with the Novatouch by purchasing some good lubricants. But that is extra cost.Also the stock caps are ass on the Novatouch. The higher end Topre boards come with some of the best made PBT caps on the market. And honestly after you choose to get a good set of keycaps for your Novatouch you are already hitting the cost level of the higher end Topre boards to begin with.The only real thing that the Novatouch offers over the higher end Topre boards is the ability to use Cherry MX stem keysets of which are higher availability and more variations.,buildapcsales,d07mf0j,1,t5_2s3dh

The ram would work fine in most cases and people were none the wiser. Now what happens is the same people who used to do this go back and give a scathing review about how the motherboard wont post and its gigabytes fault when in reality their four sticks of ram arent supported as it clearly says in the QVL. Most people having this problem picked up the unsupported corsair vengeance lpx model.

I have one with similar specs and can run stuff like GTAV Killing Floor  Payday  ranging from medhigh to maxed out fps in order.It should be noted though this is the GB M not the GB. From memory when I was looking for laptops this has a couple annoyances.It is a pain to upgrade because you cant access almost anything RAM only? not positive here from the back panel. You have to remove the keyboard to access the HDD for example.All of the ports are on the right side so if youre right handed and using a separate mouse in a tight space that might be really annoying.There were a few reasons I didnt pick this one myself and I cant remember all of them.

7090038,0,t3_4co0yi,Have the rare SLI m version.  Honestly it was a little beast.  The screen was incredibly clear and vibrant the keyboard was spaced well and backlit though its still a chiclet laptop keyboard so dont expect mechanical orgasms and the overall lookfeel was sleek but very gamery.  It weighed a butt and a half.Two major fucking problems though.  The software it comes with is unforgivable.  I used the builtin battery draincharge ONCE to see if it would help my battery life.  It did something to my motherboard where it wont accept a charge unless I completely remove the battery unplug the charger wait  seconds plug the charger in and put the battery back.  Now every time it goes into sleep mode it wont accept a charge until I do it again.  The connector for the screen also just stopped working.  I had to replace it with a cheap connector from Amazon.  I treated it well so I dont think it was due to overstressing the hinge or anything just poor quality.It got hot enough on the side exhausts that I could warm my hands in the winter and before a game so funnily enough I actually found that kind of a good feature.

You can exceed those numbers temporarily if you are just trying to see how fast your chip will go. I go to overclock.net for anymore details heres the Skylake OC guide You really cant mess this up.

Im not doing anything crazy with these have a GB partition for scratchdownloads and the rest as Steam games.

When I received the drive with . firmware it was  health.  Unsure if this is now the real health or it just dropped by  doing GB writes.

The viewing angles are definitely a little worse and you will experience some color shift if you are not gaming straight on the monitor but really who isnt.  If youre looking for color accuracy I would probably go IPS graphicphoto design etc.  Because the colors are slightly washed out but still fantastic with some calibration.  The main drawback with an IPS panel is that youre playing the QC lottery for the most part and response time GTG is generally a little worse.  Backlight bleeding is a problem and you may have to return panels if you are very sensitive.  FWIW my Dell came perfect and I couldnt be happier.  What it really comes down to is whether youre willing to pay the premium  for an IPS panel.  If youre primarily gaming this is a great monitor and I couldnt be happier.,buildapcsales,d4m8ole,5,t5_2s3dh

Most of the suggestions made below are condenser mics which are designed to pick up everything around you including your keyboard. Some of them have a cardiod setting which can help reduce sounds coming from everywhere except the front of the mic but it doesnt get rid of it completely either speaking from experience since I too have cherry reds with orings and have used a few condenser mics.The best way to eliminate your keyboard noise is to use pushtotalk in Discord and Skype in Skype you can setup an hotkey to mute and unmute your mic..so I just put mines on mute the whole time and whenever I need to talk I just hold my unmute button. Other than that if youre fine using pushtotalk these microphones are great for their price range.

8557518,0,t3_4vpwkk,I purchased a dell  with an  i gb an amd r  tb and paid  dollars. this was like  months ago on a whim since it was soooo cheap. I kind of regret it for all the aformentioned reasons. SO that price is definitely not good!!I am in the process of pricing out what it would cost it make it a true custom built and its about another  dollars for a new mobo ram psu case and cpu cooler and that is somewhat on the high end.Everything in the computer is unusable in anohter build since the ddr is unusable in any other  mobo. I do even think the dell mobo is a standard size so moving it to a new case is not even possible.All in all the most you can do is upgrade the ram and put a lowmid tier graphics card in since the psu is   or ws as well. They use the cheapest parts they could and make it so it barely has enough anything to do its job I installed an ssd and had to buy sata splitters since the powersupply only had one for the onehdd and one for the dvd drive.When said and done I am spending about k and getting a custom built which is pretty close in price anyway. Only thing is I do not have a k cpu so no overclocking. plus I could technically throw an i or i in the dell and have a decent computer for a relative.,buildapcsales,d6b9kla,1,t5_2s3dh

8913877,0,t1_d7jb9hg,Definitely. So to explain...Typically your GPU pushes out X number of frames per second to your monitor. If it pushes out too many frames at once you can get tearing which causes images to split in half horizontally or vertically.However if youre playing a game and you have the frame cap set at say FPS or FPS but you hit a really demanding segment that tanks the FPS to below  for a split second the game will stop displaying the proper number of FPS and in fact will revert to FPS for a moment causing pauses noticeable especially in games with a large series of explosions or particle effects.Freesync and Gsync solve both of those issues. If your GPU pushes out too many frames freesync slows them down enough to prevent tearing. If your GPU pushes out too few frames your monitor temporarily will simply lower its refresh rate instead of staying locked to only  or FPS.This is not a perfect explanation but essentially having freesync is  better than no freesync. Or Gsync if youre using an Nvidia card,buildapcsales,d7jbft2,2,t5_2s3dh

The speakers are W stereo  I believe. Theyre actually quite decent considering theyre built into a monitor.  That was the honestly one of the most surprising aspects of this monitor. Keep in mind that W speakers arent going to blow you away. That have decent range but they arent particularly loud. As far as the image quality goes its very good. Color reproduction is great and being a  it has similar vertical pixel density as a  p. The  aspect ratio isnt supported in all games that applies to all  aspect ratio monitors though and refresh rate limits you to fps but the high xp resolution can really tax a GPU particularly in the most recent games.

Heres quotes of the relevant partsAt Hz as shown above this particular transition from  has a response time of .ms.If we run the exact same test but at a Hz refresh rate the graph changes a bit. You can see that the distance between the two vertical lines is now greater and this represents a response time of .ms now. We should point out that this is hardly a big change and as we say the slightly slower response times are probably offset in actual performance by the slightly improved motion clarity from the higher refresh rate. ,buildapcsales,d8pbyen,3,t5_2s3dh

Its not perfect it doesnt boost game performance that much over my old K but it helps me in a myriad of ways that small chips didnt.   real cores with quadchannel DDR is actually pretty awesome in terms of being able to run an x encode or a couple VMs doing actual DB shit at the same time as a game or other tasks.

9547774,0,t3_5bo3rd,I have this mat and ended up replacing it. If you have a heavier mouse like the GS youll find that the mat has a lot of static friction in comparison to the Steelseries QCK and similar Glorious Gaming Pad. Lighter mice Naos  dont seem to have as much of a problem. Many people wont notice this friction but if youre into competitive shooters it may be an issue for you. Overall its a pretty solid mousepad especially if you have a light mouse but dont expect it to be equal in quality to more expensive pads.edit In regards to value this is a stellar value even when not on sale. The Glorious Extended Mouse Mat though higher quality is over double the price. The extended QCK is also expensive though the square ones are pretty well priced.

Broadwelle does really well with fast ram  skylake and he less so. Id probably run an overnight memtest on a kit like this.Regardless this ram is binned higher than a  .v kit or any other weaker kit. So itll run higher  even if you need a different xmp profile for it.,buildapcsales,dac3w4t,1,t5_2s3dh

9747674,0,t1_daelse7,! Seriously I love that goddamn mouse. Its perfect in every way. The weight cable button layout software sensor are all great. Between the leftright scroll center button two additional index buttons and three thumb buttons I get more than enough for Guild Wars Overwatch Battlefield  etc.My typical button layout is to use the center button to switch modes with only the two index buttons programed to change DPI settings and the thumb button as a shift button. When pressing the thumb button it changes the two index buttons to show all apps and show desktop and the scroll leftright to switch tabs leftright. For gaming I just dont press the thumb button.I also have a custom map for the F keys for guild wars along with a thumb button dodge button so I can play on my macbook when traveling without needing to touch F keys.In short I think Logitech makes much better mice and Corsair makes much better keyboards... which is a shame because id like if theyd work together.

But those panels quite literally seem to be a roll of the dice and Id imagine many recertified models are little more than returned panels bought new that people saw issues with. Further I can  get two of these for the price of  predator. Very tempting.  Id hate to wait six weeks of course but Ill maintain. ,buildapcsales,dahuodz,2,t5_2s3dh

Linked the item they had a look submitted it for approval then a few minutes later it was good. You place the order then give them the order number and they modify it after. Doing it this way even cut out the tax charge of the original order! lol.

Iirc it has the same panel as the more expensive models and when I compared this against my friends more expensive Acer and Benq monitors they were very similar in image and build quality.Cons Stand is from what Ive heard bad but I always planned on putting it on a VESA mount so  for me Can have a small number of dead pixels according to Pixios warranty policy. Mine has  but I quite honestly never notice them at all. This could of course be a major issue if its something you notice more easily or just dont want at all. Bezel is pretty big but I dont really notice it much The one real con for me is that the power LED is fucking bright as hell and I have to cover it up when watching movies or TV in the dark Another annoyance is that when I lock my pc and turn off my screens due to a DisplayPort functionality that I cant disable on the monitor my computer thinks the monitor was unplugged.

Went from having to drop settings down to medium to putting everything on utlra and hitting fps easily in most games despite CPU bottleneck. Exception being something like GTA Undervolts nicely core clock can be boosted ato about  only thing unstable on mine is the memory clock but that might be my PSU not being able to handle the overclock.Fans can be fairly loud if you dont have a silent case.

10302691,0,t1_dcbuial,I have purchased three of these mice one for myself and two as gifts. It is the best wireless mouse that I have ever owned. The adjustable DPI on the fly is adjustable via the Logitech software suite and it is an incredibly nice feature to have. If youre worried about wireless vs. wired its nearly identical. The plus is that theres no cord to drag around. If you live in an apartment with lots of bluetooth signals flying around that might result in a poor signal or youre computer is on the floor theres a usb extension for the dongle. It will help a lot. Other than that its shape is very natural for larger hands especially for those who use a palm grip. Its kind of heavy but it can run off of a single battery. I game a few hours each day and have only replaced the batteries twice in six months. ,buildapcsales,dcbv5z5,5,t5_2s3dh

Also when messing with the OSD settings changing the samsung color management engine caused my free sync to break initially then i switched it off and with free sync enabled all my color options were greyed out then i reset every thing set freesync on ultimate again and it stayed on with the color management utility also being enabled.

But if there is a fine read restrictive dust guard it WILL sound like a legit  box fan in your comp at max speeds. At normal usage and even on a lil higher theyre basically silent but max is hilariously loud. On the other hand even at low speeds these push lots of air I havent ran test benches and recorded em compared to other fans but they move alot more air then the DeepCool fans that came with my case and all the random fans my dad has on his. Sleeve bearing but for  a pop its cheap enough to replace every few years. Only  LEDs shine on the fans themselves so the whole thing doesnt light up like the picture but it is a nice blue and not annoyingly bright.

10886812,0,t1_de1bm8c,Eh... I fail to see how one is worse than the other because they both have their pros and cons.The STAFE is an allplastic keyboard while the K is a metalbuild. But the STRAFEs plastic body has a white base under the keycaps which make the RGB LEDs more vivid. Unfortunately with the K the base is brushed metal which scatters the light and the LEDs wont look as bright or nice as the STRAFE.If you care more about build quality all metal go with KIf you care more about the RGB go with the Strafe.Its worth noting some K owners and K etc have been using lasercutting machines and D printers to print a white base they can apply over their keyboard to make the lights shine better. Obviously you need access to these machines or you can go ghetto and cut individual strips of paper to put on your keyboard but fuck that.

11094950,0,t1_depev4a,I would guess that it depends on the individual drives and their testing methodology. On top of that they tend to use a lot of synthetic benchmarks i.e. writing and erasing large amounts of garbage data to really stress the drive which works for the purpose of benchmarking but isnt terribly indicative of real world performance.If theyre using SATA theyre ultimately limited to SATAs speed limits but a performance gain over the . could be possible though I wouldnt bank on it.Thats not to say that SATA m. is bad by any means. Its a really convenient form factor and makes cable management a nonissue. I just wouldnt go into it expecting better performance out of the drive  and really you could say the same with NVMe unless youre doing something that actually pushes the drive.,buildapcsales,deplpnu,2,t5_2s3dh

If you only care about looks then fine go for what you think looks cool but dont tell me this ram is higher speced and has better components because I promise you this has the same exact ICs as corsairs other lineups and before you complain about the clock rate their other lines boast the same rates as well. So unless your buying Mhz ram  which you arent since you stated your only saving  bucks something that doesnt happen when your building test beds  you probably are buying it just for looks and bragging rights. Is that wrong? I dont know however my opinion on the matter is if you dont understand what your buying look into it. Most people will never see the benefit from ram clocked at Mhz  or other very fast ram   I would say the sweet spot for okay ram is around Mhz before it starts getting too pricy to be worth it then again at the end of the day most people wont see the difference and to be honest thats fine. But to argue that buying another type of ram at this clock speed and Mhz is going to introduce a problem is rather asinine. ,buildapcsales,df2si5r,1,t5_2s3dh

11294136,0,t1_dfblxgx,Like uUsePreparationH said...You do sacrifice accuracy in FPS esp competitive depending how you acclimate to the SC and how you set it up.  Its still a trackpad but with infinite customization more than you can imagine until you use it and with stellar haptic feedback.  I find a moderately highsens with a high rolling resistance fast stop does well for fast s without overshoot but good finetune fast aiming.  But still a curved trackpad yeah.   Though the triggers have a full pull and half pull like a Gamecube controller.  You can map aim to half pull for standard...then on fullpull to enable Gyro for finetuning aim.  Its REALLY COOL for aiming.  I dont think itll be good for competitive but its awesome for just playing an FPS if youre in a situation where the other option is a standard gamepad.I honestly dont use it often Ill use a XDS for most games still when on a couch or in rd person games.  So be prepared to buy a controller you may not use often.  But whenif you have a usecase where it works better IT SHINES.  In my case thats living room singleplayer FPSs CIV Cities Path of Exile and Grim Dawn.  Its really awesome.It also has interesting uses for gyro in racing games but Ive not bothered to set it up.  But Ive seen Project car vids where it looks fun.Oh its the best HTPC remote evar.  Thats where my SC gets the most use.Also maybe uUsePreparationH doesnt do midhighlevel competitive but I dont know how the heck he plays Rocket League with it...shudders.

11393594,0,t1_dfncsbo,Cognitive dissonance? I honestly dont believe you even understand what that means. It has nothing to do with it. You do understand theres going to be outliers when benching right? Maybe ahses of the singularity have optimized their game for more than  cores? Which is what I said would show ryzen beating k.. however Im yet to see these benchmarks. Secondly every single one of this random dudes slides show ryzen BEHIND k if something is BEHIND it its not Neck and NeckThirdly You continue to ignore the fact this random dude is benchmarking ryzen with mhz ram vs k with mhz ram. Why doesnt he just gimp k further and give it some mhz ram? That would show ryzen beating k and would back up your bias wouldnt it? Please post some legit reviews to back up your claim instead of some random dude benching a k with slower ram than ryzen. Lastly I must be the only Intel fanboy who hates intel. I want amd to destroy Intel with ryzen. I ordered a  just to support AMD even though I have a k... Fact of the matter is in SINGLE thread optimized games which is like  of games with ALL things being equal that is not running k with slower ram to give you fake benchmark results the k beats ryzen.. ryzen simply cannot bridge a ghz gap in single threaded applications.For the last time sure if a game optimizes for more than  cores ryzen could beat k. However the multi core optimization also depends on driver support and DX which is why we see large variances between DX and DX benchmarks with ryzen and intel. Some recent benchmarks have been released that suggest a large part of the bottleneck we see is coming from the API and not the CPU this leads us to believe that Nvidia and AMD need to optimize their DX drivers for large multi core CPUs. Right now this is very hard to test however as AMD dont have a current gen top tier GPU once Vega is released its going to beckme very apparent if this is an issue. Simply because if a large percent of these benchmarks are being gimped by crappy Nvidia drivers because EVERY single benchmark Ive seen uses a Nvidia GPU it is obviously in AMDs best interests to optimize their GPU drivers to take advantage of extra cores at the API level. So again def not an Intel fan boy. Love amd for what they are attempting here youre just full of shit if you think that bios updates are going to magically make ryzen beat a ghz chip in SINGLE CORE operations.Thats never going to happen. What can happen is that AMD and game developers can optimize for MULTI CORES as in more than  and leverage Ryzens s  core count against Intel mainstream  core variant. I hope and pray that AMD have now pushed Intel into releasing  core CPUs into their consumer coffeelake so that going forward in a few years games will start to utilize extreme multi cores especially with the current gen of consoles supporting them So stop spreading lies and misinformation and stop being a dick. We can have a debate without resorting to name calling and acting like we are  years old. ,buildapcsales,dfng4rr,2,t5_2s3dh

11484192,0,t1_dfxpoan,That was one of the reasons I bought the pro but I actually didnt get a lot of enjoyment out of them. The buttons feel pretty cheap when you sit them next to a hundred keys with Cherry MX switches under them and the volume knob was mildly annoying because  It sometimes actuates an extra time backfourth after you let go as it settles to a resting position its graduated and  Turning it was just awkward. You intuitively want to turn it with one finger on the surface and you can but the nob requires just enough force to make this annoying You need to be right near the rim of it in order to have the torque it takes to rotate it without putting an uncomfortable amount of downward pressure on it. You cant rotate it with two fingers on its sides because there simply isnt enough space between it and the nearest key.. so you just end up running into it. I did find what I think is the best way to use the nob and that is by using my index finger from off the righthand side of the keyboard. This is much more comfortable and slick but you just cant get enough rotation out of it without doing it several times and I never quite got used to it.Is that the most time somebodys every spent talking about the volume knob on a keyboard? Maybe.Honestly Im not very reliant on media controls anyway because I normally setandforget the system volume and do adjustments on my receiver. Pause etc. are usually accomplished with other keys like the space bar and arrow keys.Lastly the Prime does have media controls theyre just on function keys which I admit is less cool.,buildapcsales,dfxqc6o,1,t5_2s3dh

11651776,0,t1_dgfnmtt,I dont think you understand capitalism very well. Demand does not inflate price demand leads price. NCIX is selling Aorus cards for like  bucks and selling out. Why would that market trend downwards? Sure if someone sold a card at  itd sell in  seconds but if it sells in  minutes at  who cares about that speed?In capital markets price in an understandable market and in an era of price watchers the GPU market is VERY understandable is determined by the price of the final sale I.e. If everyone buys the first available cards at  then someone sells at  everyone will start selling at  or at least trend their prices upwards. If instead they get resold at  the prices will tend downwards. Since there is no competition in the GPU market nVidia should be broken up at the high end customers are forced to choose between having and not having and price is guess at the benefits of having. When the hype for something is as large and validated as the ti customers are making the decision that having is muuch better than not having. If Vega is competitive than the question will turn into is this better than Vega for dollars spent? Which will both limit sales and tighten the standard deviation of sales. Tldr our capitalistic system makes no sense without competition since thats the entire point and so were left with massive prices and GDDRX ,buildapcsales,dggqrg5,0,t5_2s3dh
