241217,0,t1_cf5lo7a,Also keep in mind that just because a helper is in the battle they dont have to use oneshot items to help the player side win. In fact nothing is stopping them from playing oneshots or monster enhancers to help the monster side either if the bad stuff isnt too bad or they have a guaranteed run away so its probably in they players best interest to have a helper help willingly,Munchkin,cf5r5ha,1,t5_2s6ol
292941,0,t1_cfajhnc,The reason there is a  card limit is because door cards are required to be in your hand. Also any item in your hand cant be theived. ,Munchkin,cfb4mmn,1,t5_2s6ol
463051,0,t3_1ze9o6,Demented Dungeons and Need for Steed will probably add more to the game than any of the others.  I have all except the newest one and that would be my feelings.  Getting Unnatural Axe and Clerical Errors adds plenty though.,Munchkin,cfswer9,2,t5_2s6ol

1520027,0,t3_2bkqln,So everyone here answered a lot different than we ever play. I cant find the exact text right now but I thought it was something like if you can beat it with your level only... not if you beat it with your level only....

1777426,0,t3_2eulci,For us what basically happens is we only use a small portion of the cards. So even if you have like  shuffled cards an average game will only use . Once we finish we set aside the  so our next game will have completely different elements.

2850234,0,t3_2sqdj7,Want faster games use the fast play rules included in every main sets instructions.gtFor a faster game you can add a phase  called Listen At The Door. At the start of your turn before doing anything else draw a facedown Door card which you may play or not. Then arrange cards and Kick Open The Door normally. If you Loot The Room draw a facedown Treasure not a Door.Im actually considering using these in most games I just played a game last night with only Munchkin Adventure Time that lasted over  hours.,Munchkin,cns2kj4,3,t5_2s6ol

4312167,0,t3_3aaj9i,You can enhance the monster and play one shot items as many times as you like. Only play as many that is needed for them to be losing. If they get their combat level back up to where theyre winning you can play more enhancers and other cards until they cant win or you cant make him lose anymore. Remember that you can play Go Up A Level cards on other people too. If they are level  and face a high level monster that wont pursue level  or lower players you can play a GUAL on them and force them to fight it,Munchkin,csbphaj,2,t5_2s6ol

5279313,0,t3_3nadpf,You could do something similar to Munchkin Quest where when fighting for the win the monsters level is changed from whatever is normally is to a  and then the modifiers on the card are applied  vs Clerics  vs Humans etc.The main issue that I see is that if Im willing to save a Go Up A Level card I can be fighting a nonboss monster while Im at level  and play my GUAL card during the fight  what happens to the monster at that point?  Does it get replaced by a boss monster?  Similarly what happens if Im at level  fighting a monster and someone wanders in another monster or plays Mate?Quest gets around this by requiring you to first obtain level  and then go fight the boss monster.  You could probably do something similar.  If Im remembering my Quest rules correctly losing a boss fight also makes you lose a level regardless of whether you run away or not.,Munchkin,cvmhrm7,6,t5_2s6ol

9384065,0,t1_d956kq0,Thats the right answer here. It is meant as a joke because cheating is encouraged in every game as long as you dont get caught. And if you get caught you dont refight the last  battles where you cheated. Like in monopoly if you cheated and took too much money you dont reevaluate the last  stops and see if you can or could afford them. This takes the fun out of any game. Its more meant as unintentional cheating because who wants to play a boring game where if someone makes a mistake and they easily happen in munchkin you have to go back and do everything again. But people are not smart and interpreted it the wrong way so they had to remove this wording from the rules. ,Munchkin,d95hvc8,3,t5_2s6ol
