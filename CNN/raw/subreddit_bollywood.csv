I am busy IRL at the moment but vacation coming up soon in couple weeks. I will instruct my two new recent modes to be more active and to help them understand how to make revive the subredditCurrently I am seeking an active mod because I need someone who will take care of the weekly feature or discussion thread and update them. I have made weekly contents but there was hardly any participations involved. Perhaps Weekly isnt enough? i am open to suggestion and policy review.

3161946,0,t3_2vxhnc,You are not entirely wrong and it has been a few years since I have seen the movie to be able to properly comment. However in a lot of other films Anglo Indians or CatholicChristian Indian women are shown to be more outspoken and have different values and demeanor than the traiditional Hindu feale character. Some are always portrayed as dominating or powerful characters too on the flip side... like Aishwariya Rai Bachchan in GUZAARISH.         But the whole middle class  victim while more wealthy  better connections  above the law concept is quite a staple in the Bollywood film industry although that is more art imitating real life than anything else. Some more issue based films would be MY BROTHER NIKHIL MATRUBHOOMI etc...,bollywood,copqfrr,2,t5_2qhqk
3195759,0,t3_2wmns3,One thing the movie did well is humanizing both lead roles. By the end of the movie I found myself applauding Nawazs final deed and Varun had to begin to live accepting that he was what he hated most. So pro and antagonist are very elusive labels. ,bollywood,cot8o1p,1,t5_2qhqk

5570298,0,t3_3rak4c,I watched it last Saturday. The screenplay is somewhat incoherent and I dont mean enigmatic. Randeep Hooda has done a good job but I doubt that this would be his breakout role. Richa Adil are singledimensional characters. The movie is shot nicely. The director has assisted RGV and it shows in the presentation. I liked the remixed version of Jab chhaye tera jadu. s presentation was good and I did not find many things which would look out of place.,bollywood,cwnjoub,2,t5_2qhqk
