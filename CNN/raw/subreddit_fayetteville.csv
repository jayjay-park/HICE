114151,0,t1_ceqm8zg,Oh gosh I had forgotten about all that. And they charged me a ton when I moved out to repaint which I know they do every time anyway. We didnt mess up anything and got no deposit back. I loved all the times drunk guys on third floor balconies would throw glass bottles into the parking lot or at me walking by. Also when I was there groups of people would hit golf balls just off into the complex cars and buildings and humans be damned....good times...,fayetteville,cerffu3,2,t5_2r96l
159907,0,t3_1vvah8, Ive rented from Casa Americana both in the past and currently. Theyre awesome the main landlord is really young friendly and helpful. Never had a bad interaction with them. Theyre quick to respond to maintenance issues they always come by the same day i report something. My old apartment with them about a year ago got torn down to build one of the new apartment complexes and Casa americana helped me find a new place they called around to people they knew gave them kind words about me and it was a breeze. Then I rented from the Treadwell Institute. They were... just kind of weird. The main owner was a quirky nice enough guy but honestly came off as an pennypincher and was incredibly hard to get ahold of. Then one day we got the letter that Casa Americana had taken over so its all good here now. ,fayetteville,cewnacd,1,t5_2r96l

1309827,0,t1_cigy860,It also depends on the area you live in and who youre renting from. In areas like Little rock where to poverty line is much lower the people are taking advantage of more. There is still issues in the Fayetteville area as well. I just got out of a lease in the apt. complex Colonial Arms and I have left the apartment complex expecting to get my deposit back and they did not. Even worse is they were threatening me to force me to pay for many things they said was wrong with the apartment which did not exist. I threatened to take it to court if they did because of the fact that I had taken pictures right before i left and i had proof everything they were wanting to charge me for did not exist and was fabricated and they instantly dropped the charges and also gave me back my deposit. The issue isnt that the laws are bad its that the laws allow the landlord to take advantage of people who dont know what to do when they leave a place after renting.,fayetteville,cigz03o,6,t5_2r96l

Im currently googling to try and find out hahaEdit Hmm well I found thisgtCurrently the law prohibits political campaign activity by charities and churches by defining a c organization as one which does not participate in or intervene in including the publishing or distributing of statements any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office.Doesnt say anything about a stance on an issue only candidates running for office.And now Ive found this site Which statesIn order to remain taxexempt under c churches must abide by strict guidelines that prohibit election activity. The Code states in relevant part that c organizations cannot participate in or intervene in including the publishing or distributing of statements any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office. I.R.C. Sec. c. Thus as a c organization churches are strictly forbidden from supporting or opposing a candidate for public office. To do so jeopardizes their taxexempt status. Churches cannot engage in any of the following activities under the federal tax lawCannot endorse or oppose candidates for public officeCannot make any communicationeither from the pulpit in a newsletter or church bulletinwhich expressly advocates for the election or defeat of a candidate for public officeCannot make expenditures on behalf of a candidate for public office or allow any of their resources to be used indirectly for political purposes e.g. use their phones for a phone bankCannot ask a candidate for public office to sign a pledge or other promise to support a particular issueCannot distribute partisan campaign literatureCannot display political campaign signs on church property,fayetteville,cuux5i0,7,t5_2r96l
