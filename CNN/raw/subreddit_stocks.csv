175618,0,t3_1w3p7g,There is no right answer here and also depends on the type of stock you are dealing with. I like to mix up some fundamental and technical analytics and when they both line up then thats usually how I pick the stock. Some of the things I look at that are most influential on my decisions are first off what I think can be the most important is news about the company this is especially important in the healthcare sector which I am most involved in compared to any other and by news I typically mean a potential breakthrough of a drug getting FDA clearance and so on and so forth. After that I will look at moving averages  and  day relative volume bollinger bands  week highlow and also a few other technical indicators like triangles and channels but I never make my decisions based on those completely. As far as deciding how many shares its really going to differ from person to person.

213557,0,t3_1wkavv,I think in any case it depends on your strategy with the stock.  If youre day trading it you dont really care that much about the month and year action going on.  If youre planning on swing trading the stock looking at the chart of  years might be too far zoomed out.  I think looking at the chart a little zoomed out from the time frame you are planning on trading the stock is good then you can zoom in to help confirm momentum.  So you might plan on holding a stock for a month or so look at the monthly for the previous  months then zoom in to weekly daily then perhaps look at the minute ticker.  If they all more or less confirm what youre looking for this can give you more confidence in your buy.Also if youre only looking at RSIMACD to make buy decisions I think youre leaving out a lot.  How is the sector doing? How is the stock price relative to an index like SPX? Whats the price action doing with respect to volume? Is it breaking out of supportresistance? BullishBearish chart patterns engulfing hammer shooting star etc.? Where is it in terms of accumulationbuying climaxtrenddistributionselling climax?

532619,0,t1_cg0lev9,So would I but Amazon growth is slowing and is being driven by rd party taking from eBay which is  has reached critical mass and raising prime rates isnt going to attract new customers to pay for it. Amazon stock is based on growth and growth potential. Which generally happens around Christmas for them but this year traditional retailers will be seriously competing with them for online sales and thats going to hurt Walmart has already had free shipping on anything over  and is expanding site to store. Amazon is actually pushing in favor of the Internet Sales tax because they think it will hurt small sellers but its actually just encouraging other retailers to focus more on online. Amazon has pretty much played all their cards and is now just having to scale them back to protect profits. Unless Amazon Fresh goes national and is successful they havent gotten much going for future growth and the bigger companies are just letting them lose money experimenting and watching what works and what doesnt. Ask yourself what is Amazons competitive advantage in the retail market space? And how strong is it?They did well with Kindle because they got in as tablets were climbing to critical mass but the whole gaming console thing is really really reaching and unlikely to be successful I actually see it as a desperate attempt to try and keep the unsustainable growth going with hype for  institutional investors.

568766,0,t1_cg4wzcf,Forbes.. Ahem.gtThere are a number of instances and red flags about Kandis management that lead me to want to proceed with caution.  At the very least the company has not been forthcoming with relevant information that investors would have been interested in.  A company looking to build a reputation for good shareholder relations would have disclosed this information.  At worst the company may have intentionally misled investors regarding its EV sales at a time when its accounts also showed signs of possible distortion.  If thats the case it would be reasonable to assume that they will do something similar in the future.As the Forbes article says  nothing was fullon illegal. But to blame the PR people for what is clearly a longtime management strategy is simply denial. The CEO LIED to shareholders for several years.

1575999,0,t3_2cb06u,Stock price can always go up. The value of the company is a different thing. They are expected to pay down its debt with the money from stocks. Until they start making money it is hard to gauge what price it suppose to be.As a business they have some risks including the following Straight years of losses. El Pollo Loco has struggled to operate profitably for a long long time. It squeaked out a profit in its most recent quarter but on an annual basis its nothing but red ink. The trend is not improving either  the companys loss last year was twice the size of the  loss. This company has failed to get the economics right of pricing promotions labor and food costs.Mountains of debt. With . million in accumulated debt El Pollo has to use its IPO proceeds to pay off a loan. Theres no money here to fuel expansion and the cost of debt service is hobbling its progress the company admits in its IPO filing.Few new restaurants. Successful fastfood concepts usually expand steadily and grow beyond their initial market. In comparison to competitors such as ChickfilA which plans to open over  stores this year El Pollo has been in suspended animation adding just five franchised stores last year and expects a similar number this year. Thats a troubling sign that franchise buyers are finding better propositions at other chains  and without franchisees whore willing to buy in the chain cant grow.Local concentration. More than  percent of El Pollos stores are in the Los Angeles market a fact that meant it took a beating when the city was hardhit in the downturn. Unemployment here remains higher than the national average and the chain remains vulnerable to local economic problems.Failed expansion. El Pollo Loco has already tried to grow beyond its core market  and failed. In  the chain reports in its IPO filing it had  stores in markets east of the Rockies. By  all those stores had closed. Clearly this chain is challenged in selecting successful growth markets and supporting franchise owners as it expands. It retains small numbers of stores outside southern California including eight eateries in Texas.Heavyhitting competitors. The chicken category is currently a slugfest between deeppocketed conglomerate Yum! Brands which owns KFC and privately held ChickfilA which boasts some of the highest perunit sales of any fastfood chain. By comparison El Pollo is underresourced to keep stores updated and invest in the product research vital to the newproduct introductions that drive a lot of fastfood sales.Too few owners. El Pollo Loco could flounder because its franchised stores are in the hands of a small group of owners  ten franchisees operate over  percent of the units and two franchisees account for onethird of the business. If any of these heavyhitters filed for bankruptcy or closed stores it could dramatically impact the parent companys financials.Keeping control. More than  percent of the stock postIPO will still be owned and controlled by its current owners the privateequity investment firms Trimaran Capital Partners and Freeman Spogli  so IPO investors will have little pull to influence company moves.Yah said you are new to stocks.

1730306,0,t3_2e8ppi,Well you bought it in the lifetime highs which could be a setback if it goes down.It wouldnt matter if you plan to hold it for  years as you would probably get it for a few  cheaper. Which means that if you average over  or even  years its not a big deal because you are just interested in owning it and not trading it.People are buying CMG Chipotle at the highs and pushes it into new highs today now that wouldve been a huge mistake for you. It dropped  from its high intraday  which is a big deal as it shows major weakness.Comparing a  year investment in CMG to AAPL as they are both in their lifetime highs  AAPL looks like its holding the numbers very well. But CMG sold off as soon as it hit everyones high price targets. Now if we were just looking at the chart patterns and signals as an investment you made a good investment.We take what AAPL has to offer in the future they have unlimited resources to make anything anyone can dream of. So although its at its highs its not a ceiling.If we look at CMG  we really only see a Mexican restaurant that is very reliant on so many things. In order for CMG to keep its value they have to continue hitting really high expectations. The company is focused on shareholder values ahead of all else  which can be a good thing and it could also hurt them. AAPL doesnt over promise but it does have a greater cult following.AAPL can kind of under deliver and will still be on top as people know its a company that is always evolving. When we look at CMG  they can only do so much with Mexican food. Their new restaurant concepts havent proven themselves to investors as everyone is expecting CMG numbers. Sure they can throw out new and different fast casual dining concepts but all theyre doing is looking for another money cow. And thats what separates AAPL with CMG their customers have begged for this screen or that feature for years and they didnt immediately snap their fingers to make it happen. They just did what they thought was best for them. The ipad mini is a great example they thought the regular ipad was all that people neededwantedwould buy. After a lot of hesitation they did it and it paid off. The next iphone  is rumored to have a slightly larger screen what people have been begging to get for  years or more? Chipotle hands down has the best burrito concept just as AAPL has the best device concept. What sets the two apart besides totally different products is that one company knows their core audience and knows how to capture new viewers. People always ask why doesnt AAPL acquire this company or that company and why dont they try this or try that? They are very very very very methodical on what new products they bring to market. Where you compare Chipotle and we see that they try and try and try to look for the next big things. They are clearly just looking for profits. To meet or beat expectation for shareholders. Steve Ellis went on TV and did a show to find the latest craze  Soul Daddy  which ended up in the latest blaze. After all the effort and time to build a following through TV marketing and building a rapport with audience the restaurant was a total flop. The next one is called Shophouse  asian fast casual. If youre in a metro area  they have competitors that have proven results  almost the same exact food. In SF Bay its called AsianBox. I would have to go out on a limb and say they just basically ripped AsianBox off and slapped a new name on the front of the place and slapped their name on the back to try and do what corporations looking for big profits do  bully their way into winning.Where we see AAPL as making the mini to compete with other small devices  their intent was not to make it at all but to just cater to what the people want. They dont just go out and throw a bunch of stuff at the wall and see which one sticks. This is a long post and I am having quite a long poop. I am about done so Ill wrap it up for you.TLDR AAPL is a company that is methodically innovative and cares about the company image and customers before their overall profit. Well they care about profit its just not the driving factor in their decisions on new products. And I compared it to CMG Chipotle because they also have a cult following and they too are in their lifetime highs. The difference is that Chipotle only cares about profits and the next big thing. They dont understand their core customers like Apple does. And when they do understand their core customers their profits will dump and margins will dump and they wont be breaking new records every quarter. They raised prices to beat inflation costs but they have record breaking revenue and margins. Soon enough customers will realize shit is shit just wrapped up in an eco friendly container. You can get the same shit from places like freebirds  rubios  Baja Fresh.That being all said if you had a choice to spend . for a stock for  years and you had a choice between stocks that have cult followings with incomparable profits... AAPL is definitely the right choice. ,stocks,cjx9q0g,5,t5_2qjfk

1870038,0,t3_2g0qmz,The impetus for this temporary selloff appears to be a downgrade from buy to hold. The announcement also says the analyst still likes the companys future prospects its just that the stock climbed too quickly paraphrasing. Analyst upgrades and downgrades may seem problematic but in the long term they seem to smooth out stock performance. If it shoots up too quickly a couple downgrades bring it back down to earth. If it drops but the company is still strong a couple upgrades stem the fall. So I now welcome downgrades in companies I am holding for the long term whereas I did not like them when I first started investing in equities.If you are trading in a taxable account you also just triggered a tax event.

2015844,0,t1_ckvsjew,Stock prices tend to have an average price  a trend  that they follow. Stock indexes a collection of specific stocks also tend to have an average. The idea of a correction is that a stock or index will correct to the mean  that is they tend to revert to cycling around this trend line. The trend changes over time. A stock correction is also sometimes a rapid change in price to a new equilibrium point. Like when a Timber company discovers that they are sitting on the largest oil deposit in North America. Or a forest fire burns up all their trees. Suddenly the stock is worth a lot more  or less! The market is a broad term that can refer to many different markets. Energy. Industry. Real estate.  People tossing the word market around could be referring to a lot of indexes.   When a market is high for a long time like NYA is now people will get excited about the market correcting itself  a sudden drop to balance out the average. The reason for this is that its feeding time at the stock zoo. Some investors will cash out and bargains are to be had for buyers. Supposedly. Because you know the market will cycle up again and the bargain priced stocks will rise in value accordingly. Maybe. As for who Beta is a measure of stock volatility. Anyone holding stocks with a higher beta value will sufferbenefit from changes in the market more than those with lower beta stocks in their portfolio.

2080909,0,t1_cl42eal,Thats the average market return. Read any book on the stock market or do any basic investing course and you should know these numbers. Stocks are  and property is  on average. Has been for the past  years. There are guarantees long term. Not short term. There has never been a down  year period in the entire US stock market. Thats why you buy and sit. When it drops you buy more. The volatility gets taken away the longer time frame you have. Just look at any index long term and you can see that it always goes up if you wait it out no matter when you buy.The reason people buy bonds is because its a safer portion of their portfolio. The fixed interest percentage of your portfolio is used to balance it out in terms of volatility. Growth stocks may have a down year or two...or three. So getting that lower but steady  is useful.Also in times of recession bonds are more guaranteed. When companies go bust they dont have to pay their share holders but they have to pay their loans bonds back. This would be with corporate bonds but government bonds are the same but safer again.Its useful to not have your entire holding drop  during a recession at least you have some growth in the form of bonds or fixed interest. Also bonds are useful the older you get. You have more and more bonds when you get closer to retiring. Because when youre relying on that income you cant really handle a  drop in the market one year when you need that money to eat and get around.However when youre younger you can afford a much higher portion of growth stocks. Because you have  to  years to ride out the ups and downs and get that  on average return. Source  studying financial planning. ,stocks,cl4bv08,0,t5_2qjfk
2087482,0,t1_cl4ams4,I lost for various reasons the biggest two were There were times when the market wasnt trending in either direction strongly enough for me to make any money.  It was very difficult to not trade during that time.  For instance imagine you start trading during the biggest bull run ever.  No matter what or when you buy youre right.  Then suddenly three whole weeks go by when the stock prices do nothing but zigzag up and down without any discernible pattern.  Each time it zigzags you find yourself thinking aha now its happening! Its going to reverse!  But it doesnt.  The market is just dead.  The zigzags go on for weeks and you lose every single position you open during that time since you sit there hoping for a trend to take off but instead the stock goes upbut not enough for you to want to selland then changes its mind and goes down again eventually enough to stop you out.  If instead you sit and do nothing dont trade its an internal struggle.  Each day you end up asking yourself alright Ive been not trading for two weeks now.  What gives?  Am I being lazy?  Am I missing chart patterns?  Maybe Im not being sensitive enough to market indicators.  And then youre tempted to open positions on mediocre indicators and you get burned. When I got on a losing streak  loses or so typically does it for me it made me upset and careful.  The problem is the hysteresis of the situation.  You lose a few trades then you get super worried about how the next trade will turn out.  Or you give up and assume itll be a losing trade so you dont even bother.  But its not like that.  Each trade is a completely separate situation.  If you lose  trades in a row and by the time its time to place the th trade youre feeling bad about yourself you can end up missing a wonderful opportunity.  Ive had several of these moments happen during the time I was trading.  I would go back and check on the contracts I was about to buy but didnt because I had told myself nah Ill sit out today Ive lost enough this week and what do you know?  I missed a  move which would have more than made up for my losing trades.  Its a tough mentality to shake but you have to find a trading style and stick with it.  Only after sticking to the style will you find out by comparing wins and loses if its any good.  But if you cant even stick to the method then your loses arent even necessarily a fault of the trading method but more a product of your emotional shortcomings.  That was a big problem for me.  My very first trades were mostly losing trades and I got very very careful.  I focused on keeping my stops very tight and on exiting at the first sign of trouble while I should have been focusing on other things like making sure I was trading during a time that the market was trending strongly and making sure that I entered on a solid indicator.  As for the last question I dont really play the what if game too much.  I was a big fan of it early on when I was paper trading.  I found out that somebody somewhere else in the options trading world made  return on a trade and I was jealous.  Its freaking IBM how did I not check IBM for trading opportunities!? I would ask.  But eventually I realized that it doesnt really matter.  Every morning at  AM somebody somewhere wakes up to find that theyre a millionaire.  Every opportunity pays off for somebody and you cant really chase each one.  You have to just carve your own niche and only look for your opportunities.  And as for the trades that you almost made or positions that you exited too early its like what Morpheus said in one of the Matrix films What happened happened and could not have happened any other way.  At the time you were dealing with unknowns and making the best of them.  You cant really get upset at yourself for not predicting the future... that kind of thinking just drives you mad.,stocks,cl55yb3,2,t5_2qjfk

AMD PUT option currently selling for . guarantees you the ability to sell  shares of AMD at . between now and April .In converse the April  . AMD Call options currently . gives you the option but not the obligation to buy AMD at ..No matter what the price of AMD is the above options offer those guarantees. Now if you feel like playing the role of an insurance company to provide these guarantees you can write options. Generally speaking writing options aka selling them is better when a stock remains the same price. While buying options is better when a stock might change.Again in summary If youre worried that a stock will rise you can buy Call options to guarantee a buying price. If youre worried that a stock will fall you can buy Put options to guarantee a selling price.Finally you can sell Call options or Put options if you think the stock price will remain steady. You collect the premium currently the . x  or  for the PUT option or .x or  for the CALL option in this example.The prices of options change from day to day as AMDs price changes.

If that is the case take the free stocks let them vest for a year and then do whatever you want with them. If you choose to sell them you will incur no taxes for any gains that they have made.

3509228,0,t3_30enff,Like others said not even close to being insider trading. Insider trading is basically being a fly on the wall within the company gaining overheard private knowledge and then acting on it.Now as for the illegal aspects If your claims are falsified and proven wrong but still damaging to the company you can surely expect to be hearing from their lawyers.Have my curiosity piqued on what exactly you plan to do to ruin a company though... Making a tweet badmouthing a company means jack shit even if it gets retweeted thousands of times. Itll be forgotten in days. Posting a bad review means jack shit. Being sent mail addressed to Mr. Asshole on your latest comcast bill means nothing too. So in essence youre either completely blowing the lid off a company by sharing the inside scoop to a news network or youre just a nobody to affect anything. Social media makes people think they have a voice but it really doesnt. If one person has a bad experience with a company it doesnt mean said company becomes boycott worthy. It just means they got shitty service.And all thats not meant to be taken as an offensive post to you like I said I have no clue what your plans arewhat damning info you supposedly have...

In real life advisable investment strategies will vary depending on the needs of the investor perhaps most importantly being their time horizon since in the long run more risk  more reward but if Im planning to spend my funds in the next year or two I wont want to chance it that the market might crash and Ill be selling at a huge loss if I dont wait out the recovery for a few years.If the goal of the game is to make the most money in  days we still need to know more.  Are you being judged on other factors like how safe your investments were?  Will you be graded harshly if you lose money?If you need to be safe investing in big stable corporations is good  or market index ETFs which will average out volatility in entire industries and markets.

4243590,0,t3_39drj6,I would recommend watching the roadshow. Its actually very welldone and plays more like a minidocumentary than a standard presentation roadshow. The bull thesis  Fitbit created the market and own   marketshare.  Theyve capitalized on the core product with extension of the hardware Aria scale partnerships with fashion industry Tory Burch a strong software platform and additional fitness services FitStar.  Historical numbers blow it out of the water in terms of volumerevenue growth.  Can it become a broader fitness brand like UA did? I think theres potential.  Management team is pretty strong Cofounders are legit and have had past success. Operationally their margins are pretty strong and show that they can scale. They have increased their intl business as well.The bear case  Competition is heating up. Fitbit has a handful of products both encompassing upper and lower price ranges. There is competitive pressures from both sides Apple Watch Xiaomi.  Will they continue to grow the market or will it be a more niche category? Hard to say  Ive heard both sides. IS this all just a fad? It might be... but its also gotten more mainstream.  Valuationwise its currently already priced for tremendous growth.Then there is market sentiment regardless of business case or valuation this thing will definitely pop for sure. So if youre lucky enough to get IPO shares Morgan Stanley is offering then go for it even if its above range. Otherwise secondary market will likely be trading a huge premium to IPO price which is already priced for aggressive growth. From there will it pull a GPROSHAK or a BOXETSY?

And in one way investing is worse than a zerosum game. Because if enough people sell a stock to drive its price down it can actually result in there being less equity in the system overall. I know because I worked on a system designed in part to mask large trades by breaking them up into smaller trades so as not to shift the whole market. This is called a dark pool.

5139818,0,t1_cv5iez0,Its a first person shooter on Xbox One and PSP. The old idea of buy a new game for  and thats it is over. The new trend in the industry same with mobile apps for example is to buy the game for a cheap base price with the intention of charging for every DLC downloadable content in the future. So for Destiny you pay anywhere between  for the base game at Best Buy Amazon or on the Xbox store or whatever. Then you buy all the DLCs for the next x amount of years before they inevitably release a Destiny  and reset the cycle. The DLCs are released every ish months I would guess off the top of my head and they cost anywhere between  the new DLC  The Taken King  that just came out is where all the hype for ATVI is currently coming from. This DLC is minimum  and the Legendary editions can be up to about . So basically in order to continually progress through the game you have to basically rebuy new content with every DLC at the original base price or a higher price than the original game price. Its a genius strategy really.So in my case I bought Destiny on sale for about . I didnt start playing before the first DLC which I am assuming was about . Then I bought the second DLC  House of Wolves  for about . Then I just recently bought the Taken King for . So total I have paid minimum  for the game as a whole. And a lot of people end up buying Collectors EditionsLegendary Editions for  more than what I have paid. And this is just one of their successful games.

Earning  on your investment in even a year is beyond excellent.  To quote Wall Street dont get emotional with your stock especially if youre doing short term trades. I follow a handful of companies and their news. A solid company will always recover from missed earnings or a flopped product. Invest when this occurs  Invest with money you dont care to lose. Ifwhen the market crashes HOLD! Selling at that time only guarantees a loss. The market will eventually get you back to at least your initial investment. Might even take years to bounce back.  Make sure you tell your accountant your earnings or loss at the end of the year. My typical strategy I set the max percentage of profit and loss Im willing to take and I set myself hard limits  typically aim for  swing. The ah shit I could have made more money rush or high will make you make moves you will regret later more often than not. An example  TSLA. Tomorrow their ER earnings report is coming out and most are predicting a dip because of recent news. Ill let you do your own research behind this.

But the owner of Tesla Mr. Musk is a higher up at SolarCity and is the largest share holder of SolarCity stock. He definitely has reason to do whatever possible to protect and grow his investment. The stock is definitely down. What is intriguing to me though is that Tesla is leading the way right now when it comes to solar batteries if you will.. Which allows a the energy to be stored for a time when the sun is not out creating the energy. Right now from my understanding peoplecompanies who have invested in solar to offset energy costs only get the solar energy during the day when the sun is shining. Although at an early stage a battery pack with the capacity to hold excess energy for the night time would be a real game changer. With Tesla being the company manufacturing these batteries they will almost absolutely only be available to SolarCity systems. With the home version of the battery already back ordered for over a year. Its not like there will be an endless supply and a need to sell them. I see Musk leveraging this to only further the gap that SolarCity has on other companies when it comes to the amount of panels installed each quarter. Other companies are definitely working on the same thing but Tesla is far and away in the lead when it comes to the solar saving battery pack to offset energy costs to potentially  hrs per day.

Quarterly and annual reports are a very delayed report of what happened.  Technical analysis can show the emotions and farts as they happen.  Granted the price direction and volume indicators can show when insiders or institutions are buying or selling specifically however does it really matter?  If theres a huge jump in volume accompanied by a drop in price its pretty safe to say someone managing a large account somewhere farted.  Lol.  Or their daughter just got knocked up or something.  Lol.  The thing about technical analysis is that it doesnt have to be used on a  minute timeframe.  You can use it on weekly monthly or even yearly charts.  The analysis works on all timeframes.  Im not a day trader.  I mostly look at daily and weekly charts.  Sometimes monthly.  Once I see a chart I like on that level Ill drop to an hourly chart to better pinpoint buy or sell points.

6606294,0,t1_d02m5xs,Just because you say something doesnt make it true.You can do these comparisons and historic analyses quite easily in excel. Try it out! You might learn something!  The deviation of the market during the period you are talking about is quite high whereas KOs was quite low over the last year. So even though the AVERAGE market return is higher than KOs return this year the result is statistically insignificant because of the high deviation in SampP returns. Again this is a stupid comparison because KO outperformed the market this year and in every other time frame historically for the last  years. BUT EVEN IF you do the comparison as you suggest the result is not statistically significant. Fair enough that we can disagree about where KO is GOING in the future. HOWEVER you reference historical charts in your first comment that do not support your hypothesis that the broader market outperforms KO historically. In fact KO returns for the last  years were more than double broader market returns. Youll also notice that I made no claims about where KO is going I was only correcting your claims about its historic underperformance. ,stocks,d02n9ov,2,t5_2qjfk

The first day that oil went up  UWTI goes up  meaning UWTI went to . Mad gains! But the next day oil dropped  so UWTI dropped  from  to . ??? Oil over the course of those fictional two days didnt move but you lost  dollars overall trading a x ETF. This of course is just an extreme example but these type of mismatches and decay continually compound and add up. Take a look at every x ETF chart and youll see that there is a downward sloping curve because of this effect. Sometimes these ETFs have to do reverse splits because their value has eroded over time multiple times for instance DUST had to do a reverse split yesterday ,stocks,d3boz3p,3,t5_2qjfk

These industries have an uncertain future and offer higher reward for higher risk.Probably the simplest way to look at it is unless you are truly a gambler always INVEST in stuff that has a future so that your own future will be stable and use money that you can afford to lose to TRADE speculative stuff that will give you short term high reward gains for taking on bigger risk. ,stocks,d3e5nd7,6,t5_2qjfk

You think theyre holding from before the competitor FDA vote and couldnt close their positions due to the rise?Its important to know the reason that so many are shorting is there any risk of bankruptcy? It seems fairly certain that a buyout would happen before bankruptcy. The fact that they have a monopoly on this drug for at least an entire year seems enormous. Plus if they get the label changes from  hours.. For reference I plan on putting roughly k into this and yoloing most of my portfolio..

Nobody here calculates intrinsic value and theorizes out from there.

8028977,0,t3_4p57oc,No one answered your question so Ill answer it. Realistically a regular person with a real account cannot do this. The reason? Stocks that move in such small amounts over and over are most likely bots trading with themselves hoping to catch some bait i.e. you to make some more money.Also someone would have to buy your share you are selling. This is something simulated trades cannot predict. The stock might be selling for  penny more but are there actually any buyers for it?A stock like that realistically does not exist. One at a low share price with enough buyers who would pay your offer price when it increases and decreases at a constant rate through out the day.Now perhaps you got lucky and entered in the middle of these bot trades. The market makers randomize who buys from who. So you can perhaps make a few thousand from it.

8424950,0,t1_d5uk1hn,gt Cant you subtract capital losses from your annual capital gains?Yes so long as both are realized lossesgains.  You only pay tax on your net gains and get to carry forward any net losses in excess of  into the next year as you can only claim a maximum deduction of  per year in capital lossesgt Also isnt there an alternative method of calculating the tax due? What situations would that benefit someone?Not on capital gains as far as Im aware.  I am not an expert though.gt My point is that if someone makes a lot of trades but doesnt actually make a profit at the end of the year from all of those combined trades that they wont owe tax right?Correct.  Also important to note that any commissions paid for those trades are included in your cost basis and will lower your tax bill or profits accordingly.,stocks,d5uns6c,2,t5_2qjfk

They will be an interface where you and your friends can hang out or go on a trip or ride some roller coasters or what ever. For businesses you can hold meetings or conference calls or presentations within the company or interact with consumers to customize orders or consult or give examples of your offerings.

Weve gotten so efficient at finding and extracting crude oil. More efficient than weve ever been. Whether it be through shale plays offshore drilling vertical drilling you name it... Weve perfected our craft. So much so that our the entire globe as a collective production levels far outweigh our consumption levels. To dumb it down even though this is what it all comes back to supply far outweighs demand. And there are all kinds of issues that complicate demand catching back up to supply. The fact that our means of production have gotten better than ever is one for sure but there are other issues... Geopolitics. Regulations. What is for certain is that the price of crude oil which is the pinnacle of the performance of this ETF wont be near its highs for some time to come. Decades perhaps.

9330938,0,t1_d8yr2jq,Personally I own things like Constellation Brands STZ which is the largest wine company in the world and becoming an increasingly big player in beer. Some days may be up some days may be down but I have confidence in the company and the idea that people will still be having wine and beer with their meal or for whatever reason  years from now  years etc. I reinvest dividends which are small now but growing and I dont think about it.That last part is particularly important. This isnt a recommendation to buy Constellation but what it is is a recommendation to buy quality. You dont have to babysit quality you dont have to micromanage quality. Easily understandable business great management great assets both physical and intangible and growing dominance in the industry. Thats it.Too many people think that investing is this sort of attention deficit disorder activity where they have to constantly flit from one thing to the next. Just buy good companies and let your money work for you rather than having to spend so much time watching every tick up and every tick down and worrying about it. Its less stress less time intensive.This biotech and penny stock stuff that this sub is so obsessed with is gambling. If youre going to gamble though  and its not something Id recommend or have any interest in  you have to take an educated look at the risk involved and understand what you are getting into. If you dont then you may as well go to Vegas and roll the dice because thats essentially what youre doing.So I cant tell you what to do with this stock I can tell you more broadly how I approach investing and personally the more Ive moved towards the way I approach it now the more enjoyable an activity Ive found investing to be.,stocks,d8yrj8v,2,t5_2qjfk

10023484,0,t1_dbe19l2,So users are presented with an AD that usually redirects them to a webpage that tries to either sell a product or collect an email and phone number for a mailing list. The VAST majority of online advertising operates in such a fashion. In the industry theyre called landing pages. Advertisers create a number of landing pages to see how the marketing campaign would perform on a larger scale before making decisions. Facebooks ads work because the difference between a link your friend posts and a sponsored ad isnt inherently obvious. There is a small sponsored text at the top of the post but theres no inherently obvious way to distinguish ads from posts in your feed. A friend of your clicks like on an ad and what you see is john doe likes  along with the ad which is highly targeted based on information Facebook has collected about you from your profile and other sources. On instagram the amount of data points collected on users is fairly limited  maybe who they follow and the tags they like. Now most users dont search for tags. Ads on IG are inherently obvious as IG shows you WHO POSTED not who likes what. Accompanying text is not an ability. The text must be embedded in the image which makes ads more cluttered and less cohesive. If you look at the successful advertising platforms such as Google youd notice their text ads are far more expensive than image ads. Why? Because they work a whole lot better. Someone searching for something is more likely to read text before deciding to click and less likely to click on an image as they are seen as advertisements in the eyes of the public. In other words image ads are obvious and ads with accompanying texts are less intrusive  or at least they appear to be to the naked eye. No imagevideo ad platform has been even remotely as successful as platforms that features text as well. ,stocks,dbe368o,2,t5_2qjfk

If you think NVDA will slow down sure thats your opinion. As all those things I mentioned continue to grow so will the company. And your starbucks comparison is accurate. It does make sense to invest in something that people are interested in. For example sticking to clothing why do some bankrupt while some dont? Because of popularity aka people like it which means they buy it. Of course the style and material is a factor but bottom line is if people are interested in it they buy it.

Until we see actual independent benchmarks which I think are allowed to be released next week? Well know the true answer. However with what i have seen AMD is at worse case pretty close to intel and best case ahead of them in some specific areas. The BIG question will be to see how Intel responds to this with their next release. you can see they already responded a little bit in Kaby lake by allowing the Pentium Dual Cores to use hyper threading basically making the i a waste of money. So their  CPU is now as good as their  CPU from Skylake. ,stocks,de4fyce,1,t5_2qjfk

With Nokias exit from phones GPS connected devices with satnav capability they no longer had anything to integrate it with. It made sense to sell.ERIC is also beaten down also below  though and is now trending up for same reasons as NOK. G speculation. I think NOK has more upside potential than ERIC since it offers a wider spread of infrastructureservicessoftware than ERIC following ALU integration. However those wanting to spread their G bets should buy both. Note that many networks customers dont like to bet on one company so you will see many press releases stating company X has formed partnership with both NOK and ERIC for G. Question is who takes the biggest share.NOK also has potential to surprise with consumer or business electronics successes VR Withings etc since its brand still has wider recognition in some territories maybe not USA which simply doesnt apply to ERIC.Huawei is another option will do great in China but western governments are concerned with chinese backdoors so dont expect them to grab big western G business.You can consider likes of Qualcomm or Cisco g plays but different areas really.Im sure some people on this sub look at the old NOK an post stupid things but that doesnt matter if you understand NOK now.

Intels market sharemargins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively to target our customersand our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. Theseaggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many ofour products and adversely affected our margins and profitability.Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution throughvarious brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intels position in the microprocessor market Intelhas been able to control x microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate thetype of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platformwhich includes core logic chipsets graphics chips motherboards and other components necessary to assemble acomputer system. OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intelwhich can make them less innovative on their own and to a large extent can become distributors of Inteltechnology. Additionally Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x microprocessors thatcould cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.As long as Intel remains in this dominant position we may be materially adversely affected by Intels business practices including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions which may limit ourmarket share and margins product mix and introduction schedules product bundling marketing and merchandising strategies exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners that require or result inexclusive product arrangements de facto control over industry standards and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PCindustry participants including motherboard memory chipset and basic inputoutput system or BIOSsuppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of itsOEM customers.,stocks,dfgxfbo,1,t5_2qjfk
