250569,0,t3_1wyjir,I do not see the book as intentionally racist but incidentally so.  For Conrad the book is not really about Africa or Africans and indeed could have been set in any place where the locals were sufficiently undeveloped as to produce a seemingly impossible gulf between the highest peaks of European science art and critical thinking represented by Kurtz and the locals who impose none or negligible restraint on his ego.  Remember that this book was written  years before Freud published his theory of the part brain and reflect on the fact that this was a book about the process of a journey  internal and external  not a travelogue or guide to Africa.  This is unfortunate as it leads to deliberate denigration of the bitroles handed to .  Maybe it would have been better written as a science fiction book with another race from another planet taking the role of the Africans. although SF as a genre was not popular at the time and Conrads great love was always the sea.  ,literature,cf6q577,1,t5_2qhps

In most cases they start that journey from another continent. They also tend to have a great deal more disposable packaging.gt Finally unlike other consumer electronics eink readers dont need to be replaced every  years.They may not need to be replaced due to obsolescence but theyre still far more prone to irreparable damage and functionalitydecreasing wear than physical books. It is of course possible to make them more durable and so extend the average lifespan and that will inevitably bring down the cost of reading vs. devices that do have to be replaced each year. Its hard to imagine any one device lasting decades which is something even modern books can do.None of which is to say that the monetary and environmental costs might not work out for some people. The more you read the less your costly the technology ends up being over the long run.

Trying to get everyone to empathize with everyone else is a futile endeavor because youre never going to have the sort of touchfeely utopia in which everyone is understood and included. Human beings exist in cliquish groups with strong intragroup competition and people will always face forms of exclusion or teasing.With regards to the issue of suicide why do you think Wallace killed himself? Do you think it was a problem of empathy? Obviously there were issues with his medication and depression but Wallace was an immensely intelligent man and he was more than aware of the ramifications of his chemical imbalance. Indeed Franzen has been quoted as saying that his suicide was calculated to inflect maximum pain on his loved ones.Its always struck me that Wallaces suicide was in response to the broader hopelessness he felt in the changing Western world you see a similar tone of frustration and in many of Franzens essays.Which is to say as much as I love Wallace its a tad hypocritical for you to quote his criticism of Ellis as failing to illuminate the possibility for being human in the modern world when Wallace himself clearly didnt stand by or act the prescription of his own writing. How could a man who gave that commencement speech at Kenyon have killed himself in the way he did? Is that not a partial refutation of his own work?Questions to think about though for whats its worth I agree with much of Wallaces diagnosis of the American problem with irony and our worsening addiction to cheap pleasures  I just think the bleakly nihilistic portrait painted by Ellis is a far more accurate prediction of where America is heading than the pained calls for Sisyphean empathy offered by Wallace.,literature,cfjm3ed,0,t5_2qhps
413795,0,t3_1ysh5p,Ive been reading Composers of the Nazi Era by Michael H. Kater. It looks at eight different composers who were composing during the Third Reich and the different experiences they had. So far Ive read about Werner Egk Paul Hindemith Kurt Weill Karl Amadeus Hartmann and Carl Orff. The most important thing Ive found is that its difficult to read a book about Nazi composers without Carmina Burana getting stuck in your head. This has nothing to do with the book itself but it is a sideeffect. However Ive found that having Carmina Burana in my head just makes the book so much more interesting and tragic. The writing itself is very dry trying to portray the composers as objectively as possible. Kater is more interested in the relationships between composers than the composers themselves I get the impression and I think the book loses something because of that. However the benefit of having Carmina Burana running throughout as an unofficial soundtrack is that it gives you a more tangible connection to whats being discussed. Its no longer a system of politics so much as it is art and lives at stake. You read about someone like Weill being run out of Germany and it becomes more interesting because you have this music in your head that almost wasnt written. You read about Carl Orff being a Nazi and that makes Carmina Burana so much more human and sad.Im enjoying the book but I think its more despite the writing than because of it. ,literature,cfnnlx3,2,t5_2qhps

465510,0,t1_cft1emw,Your explanation is actually a perfect example of structuralism not deconstruction. You show that two termsfaith and doubtare defined only inasmuch as they differ from each other. Deconstruction however is a poststructuralist movement so it usually takes the differential analysis of a binary merely as a starting point. A deconstructionist approach will lay out a structure e.g. epistemology and then as unotwantedonthevoyage says flip those preconceived notions about how the world works. What are notions of how the world works that we can flip? Usually logic history or truthwhat Derrida refers to as logocentrismare the targets. In the example of doubt and faith these terms are central to epistemology the study of knowledge and how it comes to be. And not only are they central their very instability is what allows the generation of the entire discourse of that system. I.e. you cant even have an epistemological debate if faith and doubt really were fixed points of reference. A Derridean analysis would show that the search for a procedure that can label knowledge as true and false is dependent upon the doubtfaith binary and that the instability of this binary suggests the impossibility of finding a clear indisputably true example of knowledge. In other words Derrida shows that the historical drive to cleanly define things within a logical system is impossible because such searches are always predicated upon binary oppositions that hold no positive value. The last and toughest part of a deconstructionist analysis is to find a way of out of the morass thats bogged down philosophy in endless circular reasoning. This is the part where youll hear all the silly terms like diffrance supplement etc. that characterize deconstruction which are needed to define an alternative to the traditional structure and point the way to a new understanding.

Modernism is characterized by a selfconscious break with traditional styles of poetry and verse. Modernists experimented with literary form and expression adhering to Ezra Pound maxim to Make it new.  The modernist literary movement was driven by a conscious desire to overturn traditional modes of representation and express the new sensibilities of their time.  The horrors of the First World War saw the prevailing assumptions about society reassessed.

While there is virtually no thread tying his stories together in December they individually blew me away. Saunders has an incredible gift for imagining worlds that are similar to ours but distant enough to allow us a glance from above. Phil was just okay but quite funny and invoked a Swiftian touch. I flew through Love Dishonor Marry Die Cherish Perish by David Rakoff in one sitting he exhibits absolutely phenomenal language control and tucks incredibly morbid and somber stories in with lovely exposes on relationships to paint a picture of humanity that reads like Dr. Seuss but hits like Dostoyevsky although he doesnt hold a candle to the Russian. The Stranger by Camus left me feeling empty inside and questioning everything that went on in other peoples heads so I picked up Lolita by Nobakov to delve into another mind and proceeded on an innermorality roller coaster ride.

624186,0,t3_21agme,The study of story is a unique discipline in school. Tens of thousands of years ago we huddled around campfires and listened to elders tell us about how the strange fire in the sky came to be and why the wolves hunt us and how some take on the shapes of creatures and stalk prey in the night.Stories were told for entertainment but they were also one of the primary transmitters of culture that is those elements within a group of people that make us distinct from them. The transmission of stories was primarily oral until just a few hundred years ago when a critical mass of a population could read and enough texts were in the wild that people could have ready access to them. Until Gutenberg books had to be handscribed which meant that they were rare costly and imperfect. With the advent of the printing press came the dissemination of the Bible first meaning that Westerners suddenly had access to the holy book that for centuries were under lock and key by the keepers of the faith. Then when the west had access to written novels poetry and later short stories and folk tales stories went from being able to be disseminated from one person to a small group to disseminated from one person to thousands potentially tens of thousands of people simultaneously. It changed culture in a way that is completely alien to you and me sitting down on our respective computers and typing away at each other from a distance of thousands of kilometres.Today we have access to stories from every corner of the earth. Right now on my Kindle I have Polish fantasy stories from the th century a collection of fairy tales from Scandinavia the Eddas from Iceland the Bible a massive collection of books and letters written in at least three languages over the course of several millennia a book of classic Greek and Roman myths for children Sophocles Antigone and a number of novels and short story collections written in a halfdozen languages. On one device I have a vast treasurehouse of stories that would only have been rivaled in major libraries in the Ancient Near Eastand such libraries are available to anyone who has a library card to say nothing of the internet.The wisdom of thousands of years of culture come from literature. Yes theres entertainment in them too I enjoy reading The Prose Edda for the interesting stories of Loki and Odin the dwarves Ragnarok and so on. However the importance in studying literature is understanding what it means to be human. The act of studying literature can be incredibly difficult the understanding of literary techniques for instance is something that is heavily emphasised in schools but learning about metaphor isnt important for the sake of learning about metaphor. Understanding metaphorical language allows the reader to distinguish between the literal and the metaphoric between literature as entertainment and literature as praxis. Take the first two books of Genesis for instance. A literal reading of the story of the Garden of Eden means something different than looking at the snake the fruit and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil as symbols. Then tracing the usage of these symbols throughout the history of literature allows us to tap into the deeper meaning of a number of texts riffing off these Biblical symbols. The same can be said for Odin hanging himself on the tree for nine days and the similarity to the Christ story or tracing the sacredness of alcohol throughout literature or the myth of vampires and so on. In practical terms when we study literature we become Odysseus we become Macbeth we become Dante we become Icarus. We see the world through their eyes and allow their experiences to become our own. We are able to travel across time and space living a multitude of lives within the one we are given. We can learn through these journeys but we can also find solace and comfort in the escape. To me teaching literature is something thats sacred almost holy and I feel that its very difficult for students to understand this esp. as their concerns are rooted in the hereandnow I have to read this story for homework I need to understand this novel to get a good mark to get into a good college This story is boring so Im not going to read it. Its a shame really but I truly believe that helping young people to understand how to interpret literature will allow them to discover the truth in stories later in their lives when theyre more ready to handle the complexities and challenges of reading. This goes for classics as well as modern works of literature Jay Wrights poetry is more inscrutable than Shakespeares though I love both equally so dont think Im only advocating classic literature. So theres one persons opinion story is sacred and when we lose access to or decide to turn away from literature we are denying entrance into a vast storehouse of knowledge and entertainment over thousands of years of recorded history.

The stories anchoring the book are among the best Ive read in a few years especially Victory Lap.Have been reading Colum McCanns Transatlantic. Almost done. A fine novel but a bit of a let down coming off of Let the Great World Spin.Finally I recently picked up an old used Penguin Classics collection of Chekhovs plays. Skipped straight to Three Sisters as a playwright recommended it to me back at university but I never got around it. Halfway through. Slow as the introduction says it should be but enjoyable.

1137741,0,t1_chxl73c,gt Whilst fantasy has the fantastical and magical as the core or base of the work so to speak. Whered you come by that definition?  Because I would expect most fantasists to reject it out of hand.Fantasy authors scholars and readers generally hold fantasy to involve fantastical elements.  Thats about it.  We definitely consider magical realism to be a kind of fantasy literature  its got magic its got people dying and then coming back from the dead its got people so beautiful that their beauty strikes people dead on the spot.  That qualifies.  Tolkien is of course a big influence and consequently that medievaleuropean motif with dragons and dwarves and all that nonsense is definitely held to constitute the stereotypical idea of what fantasy is but all the bestmost popular fantasy of the st century has pretty much moved entirely away from that idea.Consider Guy Gavriel Kays The Lions of AlRassan.  Its a work of fantasy yet there isnt a single bit of magic or nonhuman creatures or anything really overtly fantastical.  The novel is set in a fictional version the Iberian Peninsula and the story that it tells is the story of a love triangle between a Jewish physician a Christian military captain and a Muslim warriorpoet without any magic without any traditional fantasy trappings.  It would be explicit historical fiction if it wasnt for the fact that he engages in worldbuilding that he uses a fictionalized version of the Iberian peninsula rather than the actual historical version  the worldbuilding alone and nothing else qualifies that novel as a work of fantasy.  Consider also George R. R. Martins work A Song of Ice and FireGame of Thrones  Id say that much more closely adheres to realism with fantasy aspects than the fantasticmagical as the base.,literature,chxlucc,4,t5_2qhps
1141689,0,t3_276shz,Im currently reading Roll Jordan Roll by Eugene Genovese for context in my honors thesis. It explores at least from what Ive read so far the Marxist point of view of Paternalistic system of slavery. Its a pretty good read however taking notes while reading slows my reading rate to about  pages an hour. Genovese has an extraordinary amount of evidence for his argument in the form of footnotes but sometimes I think wish he would go more into detail with them. Im always taken aback with the Marxist view since Ive never thought too deeply about my own political values. Its not something Im all to concerned with though and I think it allows me to properly critic Genoveses views because Im not bias for or against him.

1415450,0,t1_citijsx,As I commented in the blog thanks for such a hugely informative response.The remark on caldera from On Writing is a great find. As the blog relates Di Giovanni was never able to translate Borges Ficciones  which includes Funes The Memorious  because his publisher E. P. Dutton couldnt acquire the rights. If they are flawed translations following a Spanish rather than the intended Uruguayan meaning I dont think the translations cauldron and stewpot instead of kettle are justifiable stylistically either. I dont think either adds essentially to the flow of language. Cauldron is perhaps more atmospheric but the clunkiness of kettle would seem to add the comic touch  and a different sound  which I think Borges is certainly pushing towards. Meat blanket and a ponchoful of meat at least possess an absurdity that seems to fit with Funes endeavour.The apparent reference youve identified to the Uruguayan satirical magazine is most interesting of all because it suggests a potential source for Borges. I agree with you  I think the translators should have kept the title as it was El Negro Timoteo without changing the form or substituting The.On Writing does provide sound reasons for Borges reluctance to translate his own works into English. My feeling is that his reluctance reflected also the extent to which he viewed translation as transformative  a creative process only loosely bound to the original text. Borges broke with Di Giovanni not long after the exchanges that produced On Writing so Di Giovanni continued his series of translations for E. P. Dutton without Borges input.Thanks again.,literature,citpemy,6,t5_2qhps
1447069,0,t1_cixg3aq,Me too but doing it a different order. I got through The Border Trilogy over a few weeks in MayJune and now I am currently about halfway through Blood Meridian. If you like one youll like them all. Blood Meridian has a more fantastical mythical aura to it mostly because of The Judge and his seemingly superhuman presence and deeds but they all depict the same gritty take on the relationships between the indigenous and settled people of the southwestern US and Mexico with a sense of arcane language that makes it feel like the novels actually come from that very same time and place. Ive been going back and forth between McCarthy and Faulkner having read a quartet of his novels as well over the last few monthsAs I Lay Dying The Sound and The Fury Light In August and Sanctuary. Im finding it really interesting to compare different historical eras through the lens of fiction like this. McCarthy gives one perspective on an era and a particular regions socioeconomic and cultural perils Faulkner gives a different perspective on roughly the same era from a geographically and culturally unique position. Both directions are steeped in violence racial prejudice and injustice but of entirely different nature. To that end Ive also recently read Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison because I was inspired by Faulkner to read more about the antebellum precivil rights era South and since that novel bridges the gap to northern life in NYC for a black man in the early half of the th century it inspired me to further than same vein by picking up James Baldwins Go Tell It On The Mountain. Mountain is very stirring and powerful but I feel like a lot of the religious subtext is lost on me because I dont share a deeply christian background with the author or the subjects of his novel. I feel like Im taking a selfdirected lit. class and I like it.  ,literature,cixnzvt,2,t5_2qhps

2733919,0,t3_2rbg1r,The moderns believed that aesthetics and art was a rational enterprise. Keep in mind that rational largely had the same context as its Medieval interpretation what would God choose? There was implied a definite and correct answer. However there has been a shift towards orienting aesthetics not in abstract forms but in the pluralities of individual taste. We can crudely refer to this as the postmodern mindset. But as is known any person can like or dislike anything for completely arbitrary and irrelevant reasons. And there lies the problem of evaluation in an inherently subjectivist society.I prefer to retreat back to the modernist mode of thought a bit. But rather than being concerned about what some supposed God would choose I prefer to ask is this intelligent is it the work of creativity and genius?. I make a bipartition between what is art and what I like and evaluate each case separately. Its not important that I dont like some work thats just personal taste anyways and data completely superfluous to the work it could very well be undeniably well written. Its great when they converge but they need not to.This makes analysis more grounded. Formal structures and sophistication can be evaluated more clearly. But there is a problem. Consider music predictivity basically died with Beethoven and as nonformal qualities began to have predominance. Thus it can mislead one to think Chopin the stronger based on formal rubrics when Tchaikovsky was the more influential. Analogously there are qualities in prose that can only really be subjectively evaluated. There is not really any way around this problem aside from perhaps acknowledging the quality of execution even though it may be ineffable. But that is the realm for personal taste anyways. Someone may find the prose of Victorian English novels dull but the philosophical argument of a Russian or German works in general interesting or appreciate the narrative structure in Japanese short stories or the wondrous convolution of old Chinese works. Each of these things can be a benefit or complaint. The mistake is to think what one values in literature is the only standard that merits consideration. Which is why in terms of objectivity I think its best to analyse the skill of execution. Basically does the work show talent?,literature,cneu2db,3,t5_2qhps

3649251,0,t3_32445v,Ah thank you very much for posting this udictioncanary. The first time I read Anna Karenina I felt like the eponymous character was a complete narcissistic bitch. She disregards her sisterinlaws feelings she abandons her husband and later she neglects her both her children  especially Annie. Imagine my surprise when after finishing the book I went to read about it online and found out the overwhelming majority of people thought Anna was a heroine! It made me feel like either I was a genius who saw what no one could see or a complete idiot. Fast forward one year and I return to the novel this time determined to give Anna a more sympathetic reading. Though I failed to see what others praise so much in her  I still felt mad at Anna and sorry for Karenin  this time I realized that Anna is like any good character not so much good or bad as both. Once again the childneglecting made me despise her but I finally understood that while yes Anna cheating was wrong the price she paid for her affair was absolutely out of proportion. Also it wasnt like she wasnt shunned by society because of how popular her husband was. Most people hated Karenin but they were perfectly happy to condemn Anna in order to feel good about themselves. I think Betsy illustrates this hypocrisy perfectly she also cheats but her affairs never as scandalous as Annas and after encouraging Vronsky to pursue another mans wife she refuses to visit Anna because it would make her look bad to be seen with a adulterous woman. I believe Tolstoys message is clear most high society is to a certain degree a bunch of cheating gossiping hypocrites and they think its ok to be one as long as you maintain a moral image. So what I guess Im trying to say is that while I dont agree completely with the article just as I dont agree with the popular assessment of Anna its nice to see someone present a different opinion on the book.,literature,cq88pjv,3,t5_2qhps

3820525,0,t1_cqrlpba,A very good point but I think these six authors would not entirely disagree. Teju Cole in his New Yorker article emphasized that he supports Charlie Hebdos right to publish without fear of violence or legal action but not the content of their publications. Free speech goes both ways Charlie Hebdo is free to publish offensive cartoons and he is free to criticize them for it say by withdrawing his support for the award. But he says it better in the article.gtThe A.C.L.U. got it right in defending a neoNazi group that in  sought to march through Skokie Illinois. The extreme offensiveness of the marchers absent a particular threat of violence was not and should not be illegal. But no sensible person takes a defense of those First Amendment rights as a defense of Nazi beliefs. The Charlie Hebdo cartoonists were not mere gadflies not simple martyrs to the right to offend they were ideologues.

Though Bartleby says hed prefer not to do something his supervisor never asks him what he would prefer to do and instead is constantly trying to come up with solutions without consulting him.  This was representative of a lot of charitable foundations at the time.  There were for instance abolitionists who thought Wouldnt it be great if we could return the Black people to their home in Africa?  Though well intended these people didnt realize that America was their home for many of them and that most wanted eqaul rights in America not to be shipped to a continent most of them had never lived on. There are of course multiple readings but that is the one that spoke to me.

4537663,0,t1_ct2kkav,I think you make great points in this comment. Yes this is mostly speculation but I dont think its baseless. Cases like this dont usually have hard evidence and so they become mostly about educated speculation. From what Ive seen reported the contradictions and inconsistencies theres definitely enough to question the situation and be weary of whats happening. Your comment about how this has become more about how people feel about Lees work than the work itself is apt criticism but personally I dont think those two are that easily extricated. For me books are about many things and one of them is how they make me feel. One of the reasons I love Beloved is that its written so beautifully with so much lyricism and imagery I cant help but imagine everything that happens and it makes me really uneasy and uncomfortable. The book is beautiful and painful and complicated and one of the reasons many of the initial reactions were negative is that while it is a beautiful book its not really an enjoyable read. Its just too harrowing. The reason I feel the way I do about the book the reason it makes me feel the way I do is the work itself. So for me I cant separate the work from how the work makes me feel its not possible. For others it may be different. If there is irrefutable proof that Harper Lee is fully in control of her mental faculties then my opinions are definitely a bit ageist and insulting to her agency certainly but then again I dont think its unfair to question a situation such as this when you have the publisher going on record saying theyve never discussed the book directly with Harper Lee or that it seems all the statements that Harper Lee has released have really gone through the attorneys office and been released by them. I dont think these are unfair speculations to make. ,literature,ct2lq9i,11,t5_2qhps

You should read The Motion of Light in Water his autobiography Delany definitely grew up knowing he was black and he is in fact black rather than mixed. In fact when he was relatively young I think maybe four or five his father told him how a relative and his wife had been brutally lynched for appearing to break antimiscegenation laws. Even reading his fiction gives the sense that Otherness if not race specifically is something vitally important to Delany. Perhaps its not so specific that you can guess the authors race or orientation but its readily apparent that there is an intimate knowledge and experience of being on the margins.Im not trying to talk down to you so please dont take it that way it just seems a mistake to minimize the importance of race in Delanys work.,literature,ctmoueh,4,t5_2qhps

4763907,0,t3_3g4i8k,As someone currently in an MFA program I dont understand how this piece is a critique of MFA lit culture. The culture I think is one of the best aspects of the MFA experience. Youre surrounded by writers of different styles genres and in different phases of their careers. The profs are writers who have experience and success in publishing which is very important as most writers would like to make money writing so they can continue writing and pay off those school loans associated with their MFA. I think what this author is attempting to demonstrate is the struggle between writing as art and writing as profession. I think its funny that the main critique is how MFA culture bemoans less is more but instead of writing a well articulated thought out argument the author takes a previously written story and workshops it. To me that is doing what is being argued against.MFA programs are not the reason why less literature is being published and promoted. Illiteracy is a huge fragmented problem with so many different players. My personal belief is that you have an audience with television as their primary source of story. While a lot of people take the David Foster Wallace argument that people watch television because it is easy and read less because it is difficult I think of this differently. Besides from television and movies visual narratives are everywhere. They play out in front of you at the office in your home in a rearview mirror. They are familiar and at the end of the day audiences take in what is familiar to them. You can try to put this all on MFA programs or you can do the work and find ways to promote literacy. I suggest joining or starting reading groups. But the best way to promote literacy is to teach the children that a well thought out book is worth the work. Not everyone will agree but those that do will pass that on and literacy will continue. Okay that is all.       ,literature,ctv19jn,7,t5_2qhps

5426418,0,t1_cw3kctf,This is an excellent point. Modern academia is killing poetry. Thats not to say the rigorous study of poetry is killing it off but rather academic ego is. I dont think this phenomena is occurring solely within the realm of poetry either. The whole art world especially the visual arts are being strangled to death by their inability to relay a message that the general public can understand choosing instead to play up its academic worth in an attempt to please the faculty of some college. I think a lot of this stems from the fact that art poetry included isnt a viable profession any longer. Instead of being an artist or a poet you have to take another job and the most desirable jobs for artists are faculty positions at colleges. When colleges become the biggest patrons of art it stands to reason that art will become more focused on academia more avant garde and less accessible to the public who desperately needs it.          ,literature,cw5a4mh,6,t5_2qhps

What stands out to me the most is the absolute depth of the narrative describing each scene in particular detail and avoiding the habit of summary whenever possible. In the end the novel itself seems to be the collection of episodes from the lives of many individuals each tied together in intricate focused detail and this gives the effect of the novel being much larger than it actually seems. So far just a few things have happened The good doctor has died stretching himself to capture a fugitive parrot and falling off his ladder the young Fermina Daza has fallen in love with Florentino Ariza and suddenly reversed her choice in marriage and now she has chosen again on a whim to marry the young Dr. Juvenal Urbino. These are the important details. But within each chapter are all the small moments that lead to the swift sudden change which is often skipped over entirely or given a simple sentence.

7725943,0,t1_d3k4dxl,Yes but not in the way I expected. I know a bit about him too and from what I heard he idolized imperial Japan in his childhood due to his grandmothers influence which he carried with him for the rest of his life seen by his respect and continuous following of the samurai ways. Then after WWII the new constitution based on the American one came into force and naturally with such a strong sense of nationalism he was disgusted by the new changes happening with the Western influence seemingly taking over Japan. Yet he wore western clothes and had a westernstyle house with the interior carrying all his samurai stuff. He critiqued the western world for having meaningless material possessions but its exactly what he had. His house is sort of a synecdoche for the contradiction of his entire life and his constant conflict between all aspects of his life with his indoctrinated imperialism against his appreciation of beauty and to some extent Western and modern culture.He was bullied for being part of the literary society with his father also detesting literature and considering it to be feminine. I think it was this that caused him to become obsessed with the male form and trying to be the ideal of masculinity. He wanted to create something that wouldnt get worn away by age. He wanted to sculpt his body into perfection which although is fairly masculine the old fashioned Japanese family considered it quite feminine. This femininity was emphasized by his first novel which dealt with homosexuality which led to him being rumored to be a homosexual.The most famous part of his life is his death which was the traditional seppuku ritual disembowelment with his sword in  at the age of . It was after a failed coup of the military headquarters in Tokyo as he tried to rouse prewar nationalistic heroic ideals.I feel as though this conflict with his nationalistic ideals and western influence as well as ideals of masculinity and beauty is what The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea is about. His observations of beauty are seen in the novel with Noboru the central character describing his mothers room with such precise and meticulous descriptions its impossible not to get drawn in. He then observes the female form in all its feminine beauty and then gets onto this male figure The Sailor and idolizes him as the epitome of masculinity. I feel like this is Mishima trying to convey that beauty is universal and how its synonymous with both male and female forms. But after actually interacting with The Sailor he realizes that he is not what he thought he was. Rather than being hard hearted masculine sailor who was the personification of the sea itself Noboru sees through the thin layer of indifference and sees a soft and sappy romantic. Noboru prided himself on the fact that he and his teenage friends rejected the adult world and practiced objectivity or rather brutal callousness. The revelation that this Sailor was no more indifferent than his mother was regarded as an act of betrayal with violent consequences. All of this is in the blurb or the first few chaptersThe Sailor himself is explored deeply with his inner hopes and dreams being voiced out as he falls in love with Noborus mother the woman of his dreams while he struggles with communicating his thoughts and feelings with her. The fact that Mishima is able to characterize both of these characters so well and so accurately in their different personas is quite extraordinary. They start off quite similar with the tone and atmosphere being fairly indistinguishable but gradually drift further and further apart until they are polar opposites. I believe this is actually Mishimas inner conflict as he tries to reconcile the two opposite parts of himself especially the whole idea of Westernization vs. Nationalism.And so the book is just a insight into the inner workings of Mishimas mind. I could say more about death even though that was the original question sorry but I wouldnt to spoil a book that I really recommend.Edit I just realized I didnt answer your question at all but I hope you read it and answer the question yourself.

7745431,0,t3_4le0h6,Its the first work of literature in western civilisation and probably the greatest too. The one word I would use to describe the Iliad is raw theres no other work Ive read which is as raw as the Iliad in its unflinching depiction of war and death. Homer is the most visual writer Ive ever read a spear caves in a skull and the eyeballs are described falling out of their sockets and rolling onto the ground someones head is hacked off but for a flap of neck skin leaving it hanging attached to the body. Theres nothing but clear brutality throughout the poem...and yet its all so beautiful as well Achilles godlike rampage is aweinspiring in its splendour. Homer isnt judging he simply presents to us the terrible beauty of war in all its sublime suffering. The pointlessness of war. The duty one has to ones comrades. The inevitability of death. What is ones fate? The final book where Priam and Achilles weep together is extraordinary. The desolate note of human sympathy after all the incredible slaughter.

I have never read Tao Lin but what he says is just gibberish if you apply it to poetry and prose in general not to mention making him seem awful lazy as a writer. His race comparison makes no sense as if hes trying to hint that grouping or dividing things is automatically prejudicial when saying that theres a difference between poetry and prose isnt limiting its just acknowledging different techniques the writer uses to different effect. And one of those techniques that distinguishes poetry is line breaks not always I suppose youd see plenty of prosebrokenintolines around  but thats more like a failed attempt at poetry anyways.

Thats his shittiest novel not counting his first two novellas.Most Murakami fans loved Q and it got good reviews from literary critics. Theres a lot to tie in if you know the history of Aum Shinrikyo and how he incorporated them into both Underground his nonfiction exploration of their attack on the Tokyo subway system and this novel.gt  The rare parts of the central mystical element that werent just onthenose symbolism basically never connected to anythingBut that happens in a lot of his work. Q if anything was far more conclusive and less batshit nonsense than some of his other works. For all its praise Kafka on the Shore was easily a better example of mysticism and pop culture references connecting to absolutely nothing.

9263898,0,t1_d8q6b3p,I do not think there should be such a harsh distinction based mostly on academic criteria. There is a clear difference on the medium obviously but the content as well as the intent remain the same as long as were talking about singer  songwriters of this caliber of course.Moreover as the Nobel comitee said themselves our distinction is quite recent and neither Greece nor the Middle Ages or even the Renaissance would completely understand the way were treating literature as a closed and barricaded type of art. Homer whoever he was wrote lyrics that were sung and expanded upon based on the singer and the audience. Pindar wrote Hymns and Odes which could be sang to. The Greek language itself was sung anyways due to tonal shifts.If you take the Middle Ages most of our occidental tradition regarding poetry comes from the troubadours and minstrels. They shaped the genres as well as the language for centuries.I feel like what a part of this sub is reeling from the blow dealt to the hyperscholarly tradition of literature stemming from the beginning of the th century. I am a literature scholar myself for all thats worth but I do not consider Bob Dylan unfit for this prize quite on the contrary.

9264210,0,t1_d8q48fq, gtSong lyrics are poetry the only difference is that they are sung and not read or told.so the only difference between literature and music is the music part. yeah thats the point. gtI find the level of arrogance in this thread baffling.yep. Dylan is a great musician and a great artist. How does it diminish him to say he wasnt producing literature? Your attempt to obliterate artistic forms so as to let your idols genius reign supreme has the opposite effect you intend it actually destroys Dylans genius by overextending the specificity of his art. To call it literature we have to ignore the music element thats the seriously arrogant position and simultaneously negates the very terrain upon which Dylans work can be considered art. but most here are just reflecting reality. the formalisation of the divisions between the arts in postmodernity is only a moment in the total diminution of art itself. its industrialisation and commercialisation. when we experience the division between the arts as different categories on amazon or different floors in a department store or different subreddits competing for artists to be included on their team the real truth is not these division in themselves or arts position in the catalogue or under what heading....but that to be divided in this sense or to be headed or in a catalogue at all conveys their abolition as art. Thus the real question is not whether Dylan is this or that artistic form but through that question we get the real one what even if art anymore...what even is form what does it matter? ,literature,d8qaz81,9,t5_2qhps

10682890,0,t3_5se6fo,Ive been brushing up on my Shakespeare recently. Last month was King Lear which I adored and is so far my second favorite after Hamlet. Currently though Im tackling Richard II. This is my first time reading one of his histories and Im loving it more than expected! I vaguely conceived of English history as a boring procession of Kings but actually its an incredibly dramatic torrent of backstabbing plotting and murder always against the highest stakes. Alongside the action is an exploration of deeper questions where does power come from God? The individual? Is violence ever justified for a greater good? How do we decide our loyalties? And of course Im always awed by Shakespeares ability to write such brilliant imaginative and outwardly unnaturalsounding lines while keeping the characters feeling vividly human. To get the most out of the play and Shakespeare in general Im reading the Arden edition of it as well as commentaries like Marjorie Garbers Shakespeare After All and Patsy Rodenburgs Speaking Shakespeare.
