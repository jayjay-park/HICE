From what Ive briefly gathered in that past hour or so that Ive been researching Ukraine is close to a puppet state of Russia. People want to break away and join the EU but the issue is not so simple and straightforward. The government is incredibly corrupt and violates the rights of the citizens. Farleft and farright groups have risen both opposing the government but with different ideas obviously. Riot police assume that the protestors are all extreme anarchists but the protestors want to handle the situation peacefully and will not stop until the President resigns. Ukraine is moving closer to an allout civil war.,UkrainianConflict,cfkv6rp,1,t5_30hhs

Moreover there are  thousand Russian troops on the streets of Crimea. Are you saying the Crimeans are still in danger?? Why the referendum? Why the hurriedly passed law about allowing them to join Russia?Look this is not fooling everybody.

475712,0,t3_1zk5k0,Ukraine is a risky bottleneck when Europe buys gas from RussiaWhy all this effort to bypass Ukraine and Russia?  It has to do with disputes over the last  years between Ukraine and Russia.Because Ukraine plays such an important role in delivering Russias natural gas to Europe Ukraine has attempted to use that leverage for their own ends.  The details are on the Wikipedia page but at times Ukraine tried to increase the transit fees for shipping gas from Russia to Europe.  At other times Russia accused Ukraine of siphoning off natural gas for its own needs.  Ukraine has run up a large debt to Gazprom and is otherwise economically very weak.As a result Russia has several times over the last  years cut off natural gas supply to Ukraine and hence to the rest of Europe.As a result of that Europe wants to diversify its energy supply.  For example the continent is doing a lot to develop renewable energy resources especially over the last  years.  But theyve also built new pipelines Nord Stream and South Stream to have an alternate route through which to buy Russian natural gas.We see some rationale for which the U.S. wants to help Europe with Energy Security.  The U.S. doesnt want Europe to be dependent on Russia which would leave Europe vulnerable to Russian dominance.Shale gas and fracking to save Europes collective ass?Europe is in a risky position thanks to reliance on Russias natural gas.  Russia tends to give with one hand while taking with two hands.  Wed expect that if Russia remains the dominant supplier of gas to Europe that over time Europe would fall deeper and deeper into Russias grip.The Congressional Research Service report makes it clear that the advent of shale gas in the United States means the world is potentially awash in natural gas.  The only way the world is potentially awash in natural gas is through fracking.  It wasnt that long ago that energy supply pundits were wringing their hands over scarce natural gas supplies.  Fracking turned that around but at a huge environmental cost.The CRS report outlines several potential natural gas alternatives to Russia such as Egypt and Lybia the Caspian Sea region and liquified natural gas imports.  Coincidentally the U.S. is preparing to increase its liquified natural gas export capacity.What emerged is a US State Department program the Unconventional Gas Technical Engagement Program whose mission is to facilitate the export of hydraulic fracturing fracking techniques around the world.  The State Department of course isnt doing the fracking but is facilitating the entry of Western oil companies like Chevron into countries so that Chevron and other companies can set up fracking operations.Ukraine has two large shale deposits plus easy access to pipelines which already supply Europe with natural gas.  That means Ukraine is well positioned to become rich supplying Europe with natural gas which requires fracking the shale while helping Europe diversify away from dependence Russia.  If that is Ukraine remains independent enough to do all that.Hence its very important to Europe that Ukraine enter the European Union sphere of influence rather than to remain in Russias sphere of influence.Geopolitically the U.S. is taking on the role of helping Europe reduce dependence on Russia.  At the same time the U.S. is pushing Chevron et al as the companies to do the work of fracking the world or in this case Ukraine.This contretemps between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine boils down to this  Which source of natural gas deposits will supply Europes needs.  Which companies get the business activity in performing the fracking and natural gas mining.In the middle is Ukraine a country with a large population that identifies itself as Russian and hundreds of years of close ties with Russia.  Because of European Union influence Ukraine is turning towards the EU sphere of influence but depending on events over the next few weeks Ukraine could be asunder by the U.S.Russia tugofwar.,UkrainianConflict,cfucaj5,2,t5_30hhs

The Supreme Council of Crimea appointed him to this post the next day.

Mohyliov was elected the leader of the Crimean branch of Party of Regions on  November .gtOn November   Anatoliy Mohiliov openly stated that Militsia of Ukraine supports interests of the political force that currently is in power government because the power government ensures stability and normal life in the country.So the Crimean prime minister who called in the Russian troops is not recognized by the current Ukranian government. However the previous Crimean prime minister who is antiTatar and proprevious government and thus Russiabacked is being recognized by the current Ukranian government.

Also the British military concluded that if Russia wanted to it could push the rest of the allies back to the channel without much effort so it was either piss Stalin off and have the USSR control mainland Europe or agree that Eastern Europe belongs to the USSR. ,UkrainianConflict,cgfnqqx,2,t5_30hhs

If true then the EuroMaiden protests became a fight for a restoration of Ukrainian rights which I approve of. In any case it was also an internal Ukrainian affair.In the way that it differs is that these takeovers in Eastern Ukraine are no less than instigation by the Russian Federation as a prelude to war and eventual annexation.

Because they were sponsoring Ukrainian state quite openly via cheap gas lower customs taxes and buying Ukr goods that only Russia would buy. Some estimate this help over  years for up to bln. But instead of buying and training some Yatsenyuks these money went to support simple people of Ukraine. Agree that some part of it was stolen by government and oligarchs but it was not Russian problem. It is problem of corrupt people in Ukraine.In my opinion Russia simply could not imagine that Ukraine and its population will even think to refuse such incredibly benefitial economic cooperation.

913044,0,t1_ch80b56,gtI do not watch or read anything from CNN. Most of my sources are actually Russian.For example this article from Russia Today where it says that the democratically elected Ukrainian parliament in an overwhelming majority voted to strip Yanukovich of his presidential powers. This is how the constitution was written to separate power so that a corrupt element can be fixed.True a majority of  lawmakers of the seat parliament voted to remove Yanukovych from power...But the constitution calls for a ths majority and a decision by the constitutional court in order to impeach the president. Even if he were to be legally impeached the constitution says that the thencurrent prime minister Serhiy Arbuzov would replace him. You would know that if you were up to date on the legal issues but it appears you are just searching for articles that will back up you weak claim.gtBut Yanokovich fled to Russia for the next  months so even according to his own party he is now illegitimate as president of Ukraine.Nowhere in the constitution does it say that the President must be in Ukraine to serve as president.gtYou seem to care so much for being constitutionally electedI care about DEMOCRACY. You cant just overthrow a democratically elected leader and install a partisan western puppet regime in its place without expecting backlash from the people who voted for the democratically elected leader and who stand to suffer greatly from the imposed policies of the puppet regime.gtthat it would be okay with you if a leader of a country slaughtered peaceful protesters kidnapped them from hospitals and dumped their corpses in the woods.I also demand a standard of proof when accepting conspiracy claims but this is completely unsubstantiated propaganda.  instated laws that would make any peaceful dissidence illegal. Even if you say these laws were to stop the crazies in Right Sector they would affect everyone forever making it illegal for normal citizens to protest over any injustice. In response people should just be quiet go home and wait a year for an election held by the same corrupt government.As I said they repealed those laws. What makes you think that Yanukovych would have rigged the elections? Every election cycle it goes back and forth between the two main parties. The installed government in Kiev has been in power before they are not revolutionaries. They are simply partisans who gained power undemocratically. They are just as corrupt if not more corrupt than Yanukovych. ,UkrainianConflict,ch82ht1,-1,t5_30hhs

I think most informed people  everywhere outside of Ukraine  have a fair idea of what is going on.  True some media organizations in the west have it completely wrong but some of the stuff I have seen on RT is much more blatantly false crap.  There is some really unfortunate stuff going on there and there is plenty of blame to go around.  Russia is not innocent here they are at the very least encouraging dissent and neither is the early Madian by including the privy sector.  At the center of this is a lot of real families that have been thrown into a cauldron of hate and fear. I have seen some violance by the promaidan side.  Lately however is has been a lot of thugs beating up police officers and chanting Russia! I am not sure what the role of the rest of the world is here.  Maybe it is that the world needs to stay out of this and give Ukraine a shot at solving this transition themselves.  At the the same time we need to require the same of Russia.If you have some first hand knowledge share it.  Everyone here wants to learn about what is going on.

You draft a Constitution then you ratify it via the people then you declare independence. What you do not do is assume your voice is the voice of the people take up arms and seize power. This is almost always the path to a dictatorship. If you look at Sloviansks peoples mayor Vyacheslav Ponomarev you will see that this rebellion is terroristic in nature. He said that the  of the population of Sloviansk is for joining Russia and anyone who disagrees will be controlled.   Sounds like he really has the best in mind for the people he is in control of read below.    And it is this component? It is now trying to beat our opponents as fellow Akhmetov Taruta and their ilk. Run in our environment agents of influence and those inside are starting to dissipate itself backbone. Then everything started to go in different directions each partner has a start. We have Slovyansk this does not happen. That is we definitely put our hand said all who are with us  good. Who is against us  very clear. What do you mean right? Who is against you ... There will be destruction. How? Well how? Even among civilians albeit one in a hundred there may be those who hold other views! And what happened to them?  They are here only on the strength of  people. And that here are  people to be destroyed or what?  There are monkeys which go to the zoo to watch.

You can disagree with them and call them derogatory terms but if you want to be technical the separatists are an insurgency  not terrorists.Terrorist groups use specific tactics and are organized in a specific way insurgencies are armed forces trying to set up a government they support through warfare. Example terrorist groups almost never occupy towns and set up a form of government.The lines blur but this situation is more of an insurgency.

The Kuban Host was formed out of Ukrainian Cossack regiments which were disbanded by the Imperial Russian Government. It used to be predominantly Ukrainian and voted to join the Ukrainian Peoples Republic. They also refused to fight Ukrainians in WWI who sided with the AustroHungarian Empire. Today it is not the case due to the policies of the subsequent Soviet government. That speaks about a much later time frame.gtHe refers to himself as Ruthenian and often referred to himself as the Prince of Ruthenia. Ruthenian was the term for Ukrainians in the th to late th century. It was indeed but only in the west. The people simply called themselves Rus so its hard to imagine that he refered to himself as Ruthanne. Furthermore at that time frame religion was much more important than ethnicity and most of his letters refer to that. ,UkrainianConflict,chh1to4,-1,t5_30hhs
994424,0,t3_25g4w6,Late reply here. I think this is sketchy but for reasons other than a lot of people here automatically assume. For some background info Burisma Holdings Limited is a large interest holder in the Ukrainian gas market a gas market that has come under a lot of scrutiny recently due to the Ukrainian public getting fed up with Yanukovychs hobby of signing over control of large swaths of this market and others to his cronies and family. Well Yanukovych wasnt the only person involved in these kinds of schemes a lot of Ukrainian politicians have also done similar stuff.Now bring in the US. A large focus area of US involvement in Ukraine recently is anticorruption. The US has even sent an FBI team over to Ukraine to aid in the investigation of these kinds of shady business dealings and off shoring of wealth. Also remember back in March Dmitry Firtash a Ukrainian businessman was arrested after being linked to a corruption case by the FBI.Putting all that together you have a growing possibility of Burisma Holdings coming under investigation with the US being an important player in these investigations. Theres no way to tell one way or another but Im skeptical that them bringing in the son of a high ranking US politician to their legal dept nonetheless was purely a coincidence.Theres more background info information on the shady dealings in Ukraines oil and gas market here look near the bottom for info on Burisma Holdings Limited.,UkrainianConflict,chhbn64,7,t5_30hhs

1001177,0,t1_chhsmn1,Your definition is correct. Did you even read it before posting?On February  government buildings were quickly and decisively seized by armed men from Svoboda and the Right Sector. Their political group consisted of elected members of parliament from Svoboda Udar and Fatherland. They attempted to arrest the incumbent president but failed as he flew to Kharkov then Crimea then eventually Russia.They then held an extraordinary session of what remained of the Rada  of  deputies the rest managed to get away. At this session they completely unconstitutionally declared Yanukovich impeached and proclaimed their members to all the cabinet positions of power.By your own definition it is most certainly a coup.Yanukovich did not flee to Russia until well after the coup and a warrant had been issued for his arrest. He gave an interview from Kharkov immediately following the coup stating he was still the legimate president of Ukraine and had no intention of resigning. Any claims that he left the country prior to the coup is an outright and easily disprovable lie.I should also point out that even if he had left the country unless he resigned was killed or was legally impeached according to the process set out in the constitution he was still the president of Ukraine. Being in another physical location doesnt somehow make you no longer an elected leader its a nonse argument being force fed to the Ukrainian people by the coup following their seizure of tv and radio.,UkrainianConflict,chi3b80,0,t5_30hhs

The English declare war on the Chinese who have it seems offended them no one has the right to intervene but Russia is obliged to ask Europe for permission if it quarrels with its neighbor. England threatens Greece to support the false claims of a miserable Jew and burns its fleet that is a lawful action but Russia demands a treaty to protect millions of Christians and that is deemed to strengthen its position in the East at the expense of the balance of power.

But after Crimea which was indeed russians almost all antikiev separatists has shown to be from the cities around Donetsk and Donbass region.                                               Note I call them antikiev separatists as many of them doesnt want to be a part of russia they live and havehad normal lives in ukraine. But in my opinion from all interviewsvideos Ive seen they feel like the new government is illegitimate.                                    How is this rellevant to whats going on in east ukraine now?        I think the people in donbass and donetsk regions that are in fact terrorists as they are holding warfare for political goals but feel like they are defending their land they are not the aggressors and they want their opinion to be heard. In my opinion its the wrong way of doing that but when they held a referendum it was obviously ignored. And maybe thats also an issue not listening to the people.                                                                                          Many of you might think its obviously scewed and not legit but seing it was a BIG public opinion even if the numbers werent correct I think it would be the correct way to make something of it. Not to call it complete nonsense and like Avakov say that its just a small group of people that are against the new rulers and they should be destroyed.   And if you think about it the way the way the new government got its power was in fact a violent demonstration threatening policians from the other party shooting at the police etc.                                Even the  berkut policemen that were charged with massmurder for shooting the protesters were released. And that for a reason because the bullets of the special forces guns and the bullets in the victims didnt match.                                                                              I will not conspiracy theorise everything but its pretty funky business.Im not saying that russia havnt sent people nor that it has.         But in midst of all of the civil war thats going on I think we cant really surpass that it isnt just the separatists opinion.                     The opinion of the  mln russians in ukraine shouldnt be ignored and they should count as an equal ukraine citizen not to be counted as dogs and completely legitimate collateral damage during the shelling and shooting of separatists in civilian areas. As UA arent even trying to avoid it imo.,UkrainianConflict,ci6fn2e,1,t5_30hhs

1224556,0,t3_284pmi,Translation.Situation around Slavyansk mostly didnt change.  However we are starting to see small pull backs of infantry and some pull back of machinery away from the city. The enemy keeps shelling Semenovka however there was no shelling of the city itself over the past day.  They moved here a fresh unit of the National Guard.  We already had two skirmishes with them one during the day one in the evening.  The incidents happened in the Slavyanks Kurort  and the other between two villages of Artem and Severni.  In both skirmishers National Guard suffered defeat I believe at least two killed and  wounded from our side one guy is lightly wounded.The enemy keeps setting up mines around the area and strengthening their block posts.  I believe they trashed the idea of storming the city.  However they are still probing our defenses with reconnaissance groups.  The skirmishers that I described earlier happened against such groups.   I believe the enemy has decided that they will break their teeth in Slavyansk so they will look for easier prey.  Also around Krasni Liman our mobile mortar group with infantry support shelled a Ukrainian military block post around Kirovsk village which is just west of Krasni Liman.  The enemy has suffered severe casualties and at very least  military machine was destroyed.  What machine was it we are still trying to find out  there was a lot of fire and smoke but its hard to tell what specifically was hit.Also we carried out an attack at another block post on a highway KharkovRostov with a turn to Krasni Liman we damaged a tank with a direct hit.  I will not say it was destroyed since you cannot destroy a tank with a mortar round.  However we did take it out of service for awhile our group observed how it was was towed out of the ditch and put on a truck.  So basically what we have is a lot of small positional confrontations which are normal for a type of war that is going on.  Over the past day we had  wounded unfortunately one of them has died.  Regarding the enemy losses I gave you an estimate however I cannot state them exactly.  Q. What are your thoughts about the army of South East and their downing of the transport military plane IL?About time.  Its unacceptable for the enemy to land in Donetsk and Lugansk without any consequences.  Finally some fighters and commanders showed themselves adequate and were able to organize antiair defense and started downing planes of the insolent enemy that thinks himself safe over our territory.  Q. Does militia in Donetsk region have the ability to carry out similar attacks since the enemy planes land and take off from Donetsk airport?I believe that they can do it.  However I have very little ability to communicate with and to command our forces in Donetsk.  Because of that I cannot give you exact reasons why such things are not happening in Donetsk.  Perhaps they have good reasons for not doing it.Q. In the internet there is some new information regarding two newly downed planes. Do you have any information?We have some preliminary information that over Horlovka our people have downed a SU.  However that information has not been confirmed yet and I would like to wait for confirmation before stating it as a fact.  We do know that today Horlovka was hit by an air strike.  I believe the strike was supposed to target city police building.  The strike missed the building but but did hit close by.  There are three people dead and  wounded as to who these people are fighters or civilians. I dont have this information at this time.  ,UkrainianConflict,ci7dpyt,19,t5_30hhs

Hell its not even that difficult to understand for someone who speaks only Russian even if they arent from Ukraine.gtSecuring official use of both languages...There are some people who resent Russian influence in Ukraine especially the whole Russification thing that has been going on since Imperial Russian times. The attempts to make Ukrainian as the only official language stems from that sentiment.I think that in order for Ukraine to have its own identity and not just be Little Russia we need to create a bit of a distance between us and Russia and gradually adopting Ukrainian as the main language will be a step in that direction.,UkrainianConflict,ci8dzk3,2,t5_30hhs

1277624,0,t1_cidbemn,Crimea and Donbas were in different starting situations. Also objectives there can be very different. So reasons and prerequisites for invasion may be very different too.For example in case of Crimea there already were big Russian forces so taking of control was relatively easy thing. In case of Donbas  there were no Russian forces.Again in case of Crimea we see that annexation was one of main objectives maybe the main objective but not the only objective at all. In case of Donbas we can only guess and speculate.Practically we have some equation with many wariables. On the one side of equation are risks price of potential loses multiplied to probability of fail on the other side are gains potential profit multiplied to proability of win.The problem is that we do not know all the variables and we do not know potentials of gains and loses and we do not know risk assessments which are used.For example there were info that there are large shale gas reserves in Donbas. But we can only speculate that blocking of extraction can be one of reasons to make mutiny there because we do not know what would be real price drop of Russian gas. And that is only one of many different variables.So for me it is difficult to make any realistic estimates.,UkrainianConflict,cidcm4z,7,t5_30hhs

So according to your theory the Chocolate King is blindly shelling the city in hopes of hitting retreating rebels.In reality the Chocolate King is simply destroying Slaviansks infrastructure. Hitting the mobile and entrenched rebels in the city with artillery is not an option. Slaviansks infrastructure on the other hand consists of fixed buildings and they can be hit and so they are hit. Why do you think the Maidan regime cut off water to the city? This is classic siege tactics. Theres nothing more to it.

Not even the notions of samurai going at it in an open field taking turns in one on one duels holds up to much scrutiny.  During peacetime people and governments make use of all of the land they can in their everyday lives building farms roads personal and commercial residences homes and businesses.  When conflicts break out where is fighting going to take place?  Where it is strategically viable which is everywhere those homes roads and businesses are.  Where are the people who live and work there going to go?Often nowhere and they get caught in the crossfire.  Theres no such thing as a sanitized war.  There is no technology thats just going to hit its target and not hit something else around it.  Even if there was it wouldnt really be viable since sometimes the best move is to damage those structures and the civilian economy propping up the enemy.This is what war has and always looked like and it doesnt matter who you think the good guys and the bad guys are this is always what will happen when it comes to blows. ,UkrainianConflict,cinfkm1,1,t5_30hhs

Also if you argument is that the deaths by artillery are accidental then you should apply the same argument to MH.

1521586,1,t1_cj6ydn3,Id like to add a few things.Originally the rebellion was created by russian media watched by many in the russian speaking east ukrainian who fueled a massive increase in distrust of the central government and calling it the kiev fascist juntaRussian involvement came only later in the form of mercs and later flows of weapons by russian volunteers. This happened mainly after the Ukrainian army mobilized against the DPR and the LPR of which two later formed the novorussiya confederate Most of the areas under control or formerly was of the novorussiya confederate was russian ethnically populated.Although the movement is mainly of russian speaking ukrainians ethnic ukrainians but those who spoke russian natively were not as likely to join as ethnic russians.  For example the areas in western donetsk and north of luhansk that were populated by ethnic ukrainian russian speakers reverted much quicker to Ukrainian control then those that were inhabited by ethnic russians. I also suspect that the presence of ethnic ukrainians in eastern ukrainian regions outside donetsk and luhansk made those regions less likely to revolt save for a few isolated cities with significant ethnic russian populations.Compare with this map back in MayAnd now with this map in July And with the ethnic map in wikipedia.The border regions that were ethnic ukrainian inhabited fell much faster then the luhanskdonetsk cities belt currently.But besides the point.  So why is russia involved?.  The russian public wants russian government to help the separtists.. Putin as that source said wanted to punish Ukraine for kicking out yanukoyvch. . He also wanted to cause an economic decline in Ukraine by their most productive region being up in flames at the faint hope that eventually  the new Ukrainian president has no choice but to return to russias sphere of influence given that Russia is their biggest trade partner.   Eastern Ukraine is the most industrialized region in Ukraine due to the the surplus presence of coal deposits in that region that keeps manufacturing costs in that region more competitive then other parts of Ukraine. Heres a map of natural resources during the USSR. and Population density A rebellion there would make it relatively easy to devastate the Ukrainian economy given concentration of industry within just that regions.,UkrainianConflict,cj70awm,4,t5_30hhs

The same hatetrain began moving onto Ukriane well you know the rest of the story.I thought that in the information age government can not hide the truth from people but it seems that the internet became their greatest weapon where people in the usual russianspeaking infromation zone are guided to one convinient opinion and dont have much choice but to accept and spread it. If the government wants sanctions to be ingored than a shitload of information grabage appears describing how the sanctions are useless and will never hurt Russia people will start making fun of Obama and his pitty little sanctions  etc. If they want people to support a war in Ukraine the reports and videos of Ukrainians killing people children hating all russian will appear. And people will accept and support the devastating war. Im telling you guys the way thay can control public opinion is way more scary and impressive than the war they organised. If they would decide to burn the world in a nuclear fire russians will cheer and support the decision because damn americans will burn with them.,UkrainianConflict,cjfqkxq,0,t5_30hhs

It is a very weak economy based on two products oil and gas.  It is a third world economy trying to act like it is a first world economy. Sad thing and honestly this is the pitiful thing....Russia could be an economic power if it was not for the idiots in the Kremlin that are more concerned about their own power instead of nurturing and fostering a nation that is actually concerned about the common person. Those in Russia that truly want to prosper upon their own talents and skills must leave Russia to even have a chance of achieving their dreams.  I am truly saddened by how much of Russias youth and potential has been wasted by the thugs and criminals in charge of the Kremlin.  And Russia is now a much weaker economy and country because of it.  Russia is spending the billions it has  from its limited supply of oil and gas on military buildup rather than fostering a diverse and vibrant economy.   Very shortsighted and only helps those in power stay in power.  Russia is playing by th century military rules when the rest of the world has moved on to st economic rules.

When Russia realized that the Ukraine wasnt going to renew the lease and they were going to lose that sweet sweet deepwater port that is so much better than the Russian one at Novorossiysk they decided to steal the whole Peninsula.Now theyve got a peninsula that is cut off from the rest of Russia and they can only reach it by boat and plane unless they go through Ukrainian territory  which the Ukraine wont allow since you know... So now Russia wants at least that little slice of territory so that they can drive to the Crimea  and thats what Donetsk is about.

1615773,0,t1_cjiszhp,Still confused. In this very thread you already implied that you consider Ukrainian Russian troublemakers planted by the Soviets. But let me elaborategtI dont follow your logic.I am simply confused by what you mean by thenotreallyrebels  Russian volunteers or the local RussiansRussianspeakers. If the rebels are all Kremlin mercs coming from Russia  then this is a  Kremlin invention and not a civil war. But if the rebels are LOCAL Russians and Russianspeakers  regardless of what their views are about their identity  this IS a civil war because they are all Ukrainian citizens. Thats my logic. In reality we see both  a considerable number of local fighters as well as Russian volunteers. I agree that without Kremlin there wouldnt have been a revolt. However I also think that without the local support  however tepid it is  there wouldnt have been a revolt either.The rest of your post about what should have been done instead can be spun both ways. During Maidan proMaidan activists ran over city administrations and police stations in Western Ukraine. In one case they pillaged a cache of police weapons and armed themselves. In practical terms this is the same thing we saw in the east  rebels taking charge of city administrations and police stations and arming themselves. But whereas in the West it was democratic means in the east its an armed insurrection?..Blah we can do this all day. Both of us are wellversed in this shit The way you counter what I said above about the rebels is by saying the East rebels were Russian citizens under Strelkov while Western UA rebels were real.  And I say  no before Strelkov showed up it was the locals UA citizens who took over the city admin buildings in Lugansk and Donetsk. And he only showed up with arms because Kiev refused to talk to them. But you say Who did the Kiev refused to talk to Strelkov a Russian spy? You expect Kiev to talk to a GRU agent about the fate of Ukraine?And I reply No Kiev refused to talk to Pushilin Bolotov and those other guys  most of whom are UA citizens. And then I finish by saying that it was Kiev that refused to talk to the rebels and instead sent the tanks in. People did not start shooting and dying before Kiev made its move to suppress the revolt by force Kiev is at fault.And then we keep going in a circle.PS minor beefs with what you said  is not really that small. One fifth of Ukraine dude. A civil war does not have to be . Mexicans are immigrants. They came to the US of their own free will. Russians and Russianspeaking Ukrainians lived in SE Ukraine for generations. They dont see themselves as immigrants like I said those Russians who felt like immigrants in Ukraine already left. They see Donbass as their ancestral homeland. Comparison with Mexican immigrants is not at all warranted.,UkrainianConflict,cjiu2fn,1,t5_30hhs

Heres the not so big secret Crimea is populated by  Russians and Russified Ukrainians and Tatars. Around  of the population is vehemently and fanatically proRussian. The Russian nationalism in Crimea is almost as strong and widespread as the Ukrainian ultranationalism in Lvov these days. Nobody in power in Kiev wants to capture Crimea. Ukraine is an electoral democracy. Why would they add people that hate them into the country and thus give more parliament seats to their political enemies?

This can only be achieved by an invasion or a humanitarian stunt like this. The former is definitely not an option given the heavy sanctions that would follow whilst the former will allow Putin to save face by at least claiming that he provided aid to the Donbass people.

1690140,0,t1_cjrvytw,Erm. No. Seriously you dont understand.When you sign the document you say that you agree with what it says but dont want to follow it when its inconvenient to you. Thats a thing that happens in politics. Thats a thing that happens all the bloody time. When you ratify the document which normally happens immediately after you sign it you accept the rights and burdens the document gives to you. That happens sometimes. In case of this memorandum lack of Russian ratification wasnt a secret. It cant possibly be a secret because other sides would know about the lack of ratifying proof. Russia didnt decieve anyone here  everyone already knew that Russia didnt ratify the memorandum.Countries signing but not ratifying documents is a thing that happens all the time. Really. Check history sources. Or wikipedia. Signature on the document doesnt mean shit. Its the ratification that matters.Conclusion Russia is just playing politics as normal.gt Irrespective of that international law forbids countries annexing others without the express agreement of the country concerned. Thus they are in breach of that. Russias position about Crimea is that there was no annexation  there was a referendum where Crimean people democraticly decided to became a separate country and then join Russia. Are you denying people their right to leave the country they dont like? Ukraines political situation is... wobbly. Their current government is illegal because they illegaly removed acting president Yanukovich from power.Conclusion its a complicated political question that doesnt have a simple answer. You can find arguments both pro and against Russias actions in Crimea.,UkrainianConflict,cjs7f8k,1,t5_30hhs

Oh and lots of people being shot by mysterious snipers!gt and the imposition of a new Westernoriented regimeSomeone should remind this guy that Yanukovich ran on a proEU platform during his election campaign so its not like the association agreement came completely out of the blue and was imposed on the Ukrainian people. If one wants to argue about democratically elected leaders then one shouldnt use it only at times when it supports their narrative.gt hostile to Moscow and Ukraines ethnic Russians.Id like one instance where the regime guy has no clue! has been hostile to Moscow and ethnic Russians. And please dont give me that bullshit about the official language since the Russian language was made an official one only in  thanks to a controversial bill that didnt even have that much support and was viewed as an election tool for the Party of Regionsgt Moscow supported Yanukovychs efforts to reach a political compromise including a Europeanbrokered agreement for early elections and reduced presidential powers. Yet despite those concessions neoNazi militias surged to the front of the protests on Feb.  forcing Yanukovych and many of his officials to flee for their lives.Again see my point about why Yanukovich had to go. Saying that it was the militias that were the ones responsible for ousting Yanukovich completely ignores the context around Maidan during its existence and the cheers from the whole crowd when a single protester went on stage and issued an ultimatum to Yanukovich.gt In Crimea voters opted overwhelmingly to secede from Ukraine and rejoin Russia a process supported by Russian troops stationed in Crimea under a prior agreement with Ukraines government.Those troops had absolutely no right to venture out of their bases take over administrative buildings and army bases so its still an invasion!gt But resistance to Kievs new rulers soon emerged in eastern Ukraine which had been Yanukovychs political base and stood to lose the most from Ukraines economic orientation toward Europe and reduced economic ties to Russia.Again its funny how none of this played a role when Yanukovich first promised to sign the EU association agreement. Especially since he had a lot of support from the East! And how the leaders who emerged in the East turned out to be Russian citizens most of whom hadhave ties to Russian intelligence. Nothing shady about that...xxxxtldr US financing democracy institutions over the course of  years diplomats personally discussing who they would most like to see in power in Ukraine as every diplomat does! an overthrow of a thieving and possibly murderous president  nazi coup!

I am in Ukraine. I are you here voluntarilyof your own free will? in Russian its clear he means are you a prisonerP I am not her voluntarily?I how did you get here? I will summarize his answer he explains in detail how his unit was sent to a border town for on assignment. They were asked to take the plates off their cars and cover them with white circles instead. I Where you told why you were asked to do this?P Yes we were told there would be a war gameexercise and the white circle was needed to mark the vehicle for the training. to distinguish it from others. We were also given white bands to wear to distinguish us from other troops. I what is the last name of your commander.P Commander of the unit  Lt. Svilnka ? wanted to contact the commander of the battalion to find out where we were going. We were lost. When the car stopped and he .....there is noise here and i can hear what he says there was an attack. not sure what he says sorry not as good as I thought but the point is someone was safe someone ran and he was thrown of the vehicle into the woods near by. I where are your documents?P Before we left our documents were collected by the commander of the unit.I For what purpose? P when we asked him for what purpose he said like this We need to register you with your weapons and all these thingys. I Wasnt this already done?P well he is new and many are from other battalions from the rd and they were given weapons but they didnt document it. They took our phones when asked why they took our phones they said that we will be by the Ukrainian border and that they can detect it by the single and if we are too close they can send a machine gun unit to shot us. For our own safety they took our phone. I Uniforms.P Uniforms they also yeah. This was still it Kostrima ? before we left on the first day the day before we left they told us we wont be wearing uniforms you should by rain gear and other stuff itll be dirty you will be climbing and crawling so we went and we bought this stuff on the train we got on in our uniforms but during the ride changed into what we are in now. the question is cut for some reason but on the other video it is not so I know he said Where you scared once he realized you were in Ukraine?P This started when they started shooting at my vehicle I realized this not a training this not just some march and I got scared. I You understood that you were sent to a battle zone without P Yes! Now I understand that I was sent to an active battle zone against people that... we shouldnt be fighting. P because our propoganda that was shown on tv this cut of here but in a different video I saw what was said and it was that he realized that what they said about Russias involvement is not the case of whats happening in reality I was it possible to actually get lost this way?P If you mean our three cars yes but if you mean the whole unit than now cause they all also went to Ukraine in the same direction. I You have a family kids?P yes I have a daughter little one  years  months. Wife pregnant should be giving birth in  month. I Do you have a message for them?P I can say this I love them very much and that if I make it out of this and everything works out I will return to them quit the army of the Russian Federation and spend my time with them raising them. I Why will you quit? P Well first off they wont let us keep serving I dont know what will happen when I get back to Russia what they will do and how itll all happen. I dont know I can say that I love them very much. I What about a message to your commander to your government? P to the government I want to say they should rethink how the look at the world and its not like that the people here are normal decent people that should beneed to be with there kids raising their families and not at war and theres no reason to be crawling around in fields. Its for no good reason. Strange cut P my grandparents are from Ukraine my mother was born in Ukraine it was she could come and go but not now why its like this now and why they are sending us without telling us why like real live meat I cant explain or understand. I also want to say that in a different video which is also strangely cut up he talks about how if Russian propaganda was correct than he wouldnt be alive and its not true what they are saying about the Ukrainians and that there is a war between Russia and Ukraine which is not what they said on TV.

He was deployed near the border to fix the military vehicles which he heard would be transferred to the rebels. At some point someone told him that the rebels pay well and he and his friend decided to join them. They deserted their detachment and walked into Ukraine. They finally ran into some rebels at which point they were taken to a rebel post where they were detained. Afterwards some Russian officers showed up and interrogated them and then told them that they would be picked by a Russian officer the next day. However the next day Ukrainians attacked. The rebels gave them some weapons put them into cars and they drove away. The car that this guy was in ran into the Ukrainians where they were captured. Another car with rebels showed up but noticed the Ukrainians and got the hell out. There was a rebel sniper with him. Ukrainians asked who the sniper was and then took him away. The rest of them were stripped of weapons and detained inside a store at the village. That night the village came under fire from the rebels.

1783188,0,t1_ck3v8vs,Anything that helps get Russian troops out of Ukraine could be considered helping them. In the short to middle term though it looks like Ukraine is pretty fucked financially. So in the struggle between Russia and Ukraine this probably wont help Ukraine much. In the struggle between Russia and the West though its a different story. Russias economy is a little bit bigger than Canadas and a little smaller than Italys. Their population is in the top  of any country just behind Bangladesh and Nigeria half the size of the US. They are not the fearsome financial juggernaut that they are made out to be. Commentators write a lot of analysis but it is all biased one way or the other. However if you want a totally unbiased assessment of Russias economy just look at this years bond sales. Investors and market players dont give a shit how they make their money who they deal with as long as there is a profit. They wont touch year Russian debt for less that  and it keeps going up. That is extremely bad for a supposedly firstworld country much worse than Greece.So Ukraine will most likely face financial disaster what does that mean for the West? Well if we really are in a postrecession recovery it might not register as more than a small speedbump on the road to growth. This is why the West needs to impose real biting sanctions on Russia. We cant fight a war with them it wouldnt do any good. In the words of Ehud Olmerts advisers we need to put Russia on a diet. Destroy their economy and try to put them on a new path.

People were thrown away around they started to get away from the BMD because the ammo was exploding then somebody was shooting at them with a machine gun fire artillery. They crossed a field and were running towards a forest and saw more of their troops. The driver of a BMD was badly burned but everyone else survived. They were confused since they never experienced this during any training exercise.They saw two BMDs that went to the burnt BMD and were picking men up but the two BMDs didnt stop to pick them up.  So these guys took their burnt friend and took him to the bridge where they saw some men in military uniforms. Those men came and offered help the russian soldiers agreed.

This is stated in the new issue of the newspaper Pskov Province  which appeared on the network on September .A selection of publications were recording between active military personnel of the th Division who requested anonymity were transferred to the publisher Pskov province Leo Schlosberg. A copy of the text is laid out in his blog.Reason to doubt the authenticity of the material provided no  stated in the beginning of this article.How to decrypt the conversation of August  a company was moved across the border with Ukraine. August  at the opponents area paratroopers killed Ukrainian checkpoint and a group of armored vehicles. But then in the village Georgievka company was covered by heavy artillery strike. One of the interviewees explained by the fact that in the area of fighting acts American team electronic warfare EW.From the conversation it follows that the whole of the first company numbering  people survived about ten men the rest were killed. Among the dead was Leonid Kichatkin whose tomb was discovered in the cemetery near Pskov on  August. The two sides also expressed the assumption that could be lost to  paratroopers as it is not a regular but a speciallyequipped units.Marines also discuss the situation with the concealment of death of their comrades in particular Leonid Kichatkina I understand that and Lninoy wife covered her mouth? Most likely  pancake Because she took the phone some guy picked up the phone said that I  Leon. Bitch I saw him I would give it  person would break  nafig ... Leon already lies  nafig ... Leon there with no legs you can tell ... I was talking to a man who was right there behold in this battle.Earlier Schlossberg told the publication Kashin.Guru that the families of the victims are silenced Pskov paratroopers of the death of relatives blackmailing their deprivation of material security.Our paratroopers sent to commit crimes on the territory of another state. And you know what they write on the death certificate? Gas explosion heart attack stroke. Where should indicate the place of death  a dash. Formally on such documents can not be obtained any family allowances and benefits  said in particular Schlossberg.He also talked about one of the men which is located in a hospital in Rostov regionHis mother wrote on his page which zhurnalyugi bastards  all this up and her son alive and well . At the same time he was a monstrous blood loss in the hospital his leg amputated. I do not exclude that in the net access to these accounts  mothers wives  simply by the order was sent to the wrong hands and was told to forget. The evening of  August Shlosberg was attacked . As a result the deputy suffered a concussion a broken nose bruises on his face and body. Sam Schlosberg linked the incident to the investigation of the death of the Pskov paratroopers.August  Pskov Province published an article devoted to the funeral of the Pskov Airborne Division soldiers killed in unknown circumstances then.

Consider the dubious information fed to the public through the Western Media. A bad chess player only thinks two or three moves ahead. In this game the problem is that USUKNATO assume that they can play with everybodys lives for a doctrine of hegemony. In other words NATO and western banks are playing Russian roulette with the nuclear option. If NATO puts troops in the civil war then its only one or two steps away from that option. It is forced on Putin because war with NATO is just an ideological exercise with no purpose other than to destablize Russia and force regime change in Moscow. Thats the reality.

These included Limiting the size of Finlands defense forces Cession to the Soviet Union of the Petsamo area on the Arctic coast Lease of the Porkkala peninsula off Helsinki to the Soviets for use as a naval base prematurely terminated in  Free transit access to this area across Finnish territory and War reparations to the Soviet Union decided to  million gold dollars amounting to an estimated  million U.S. dollars in  the year the payments ended.When you consider this you can probably see that there were no fool proof good options for a country like Finland after the WW. ,UkrainianConflict,ckcufmn,2,t5_30hhs

KivalovKolesnichenko law summer   till now.Differences were purely cosmetic since  ten districts officially claimed that Russian is their  Regional Language which allowed... nothing. Law included a lot of purely declarative points that were NEVER implemented. Populist Region Party made this law for some PR and did nothing to implement it.After maydan parliament voted for canceling a nonfunctioning law. Five days later Turchinov one of naziwesternUkrainian boogieman The Bloody Pastor vetoed decision.So . canceling a law would change nothing. it was not even canceled.Result  all Russian media Junta banned Russian language!!!. This is one of that hateinstigating news that made people in East Ukraine riot.,UkrainianConflict,cked2me,14,t5_30hhs

Our economy was shit our social policy unsustainable our industry was obsolete and could not in anyway compete with the west once the market opened. That was the reality and no person on earth could come up with a plan how to transform ruined uncompetive economics without the population of those contries noticing it.The west and th column areant to blame for the situation in my or any other east block country. The  years of social experiment called comunism or building of communism is. Thats why the father east you go the more fucked the countries are because the more east the stricter the regime was. Why did most of the wealth ended in pockets of few people? Because those people had contacts why? Because thats how the regime operated if you knew people you got what you wanted I know that we got a bigger flat than was the norm because my uncle was a police officer. Thats how you progressed in the comunist party  you knew people. That regime was corrupted to the bone. There were people in the party who believed in the system but also many who were just oportunists and once the revolution hit they just turned coats.These people used their contacts the nonfunctional jurisdiction the lack of proper media and the docility of general population if you wanted to live your life in comunism you learn very fast to not to speak up to get to power and privatize national companies. It is these companies that ended in the hands of locals not west that bankrupted. On the other hands companies that were bought by western companies received big investment and became the powerhouses of our economy. It was western capital that made us for a time one of the fastest growing economics of the whole EU.tldrOur eastern europe countries were fucked up because our economy were in ruins our contries continou to be fucked up to a degree because population who lived most of their lives in former regime was left too docile to publicly speak up againts turn coats who got to power and wealth.,UkrainianConflict,ckfb5vb,16,t5_30hhs

1997782,0,t3_2hm0r1,Thats how civil war started according to Human Rights WatchRussia annexed Abkhazia in the time of the tsars in . Four years after the Russian Revolution in March  Abkhazia was proclaimed an independent Union republic in the USSR separate from the Union republic of Georgia. Later that year however Abkhazia became part of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia as a result of the Treaty of Union between Georgia and Abkhazia although Abkhazia retained its status as a Union republic until the early s. In  Abkhazia adopted its own constitution and existed for decades in federated status in the Georgian republic.In  Abkhazia tried unsuccessfully to secede from the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic and become incorporated into the Russian Federation. Twelve years later in  an amendment to the Abkhaz constitution was adopted  with the agreement of the Georgian Union republic parliament in Tbilisi  establishing ethnic quotas for elected representatives to the local Abkhazian assembly Abkhazians would receive an automatic minimum of twentyeight deputies Georgians twentysix and the Russianspeaking population eleven.Objections to the ethnic quota law caused a reversal of policy in the Georgian Supreme Soviet which in August  adopted an election law prohibiting the participation of locally based parties including the Abkhaz Popular Front the Aydgylara. In response the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet declared the Abkhaz republic independent of the Georgian republic the government of Georgia refused to recognize the declaration. In December  an Abkhaz parliament was formed.In March  Georgia boycotted the allUnion referendum on preserving the USSR. The Abkhaz republic or at least the ethnic Abkhaz population took part in the referendum rejecting the boycott among that population the treaty preserving the USSR passed with a reported  percent of the vote. Later that same year in November Abkhaz representatives joined an agreement of confederation with thirteen peoples of the North Caucasus and Abkhazia. The Georgian government did not recognize the declaration. Instead in February  it announced a return to the  constitution which if made effective would have reduced Abkhaz legal autonomy by eliminating its confederated status with Georgia. A few months later Georgian deputies in the Abkhaz republics parliament in Sukhumi announced they would boycott the assembly ethnic Abkhazians and ethnic Georgians each then formed rival local Abkhazian parliaments boycotting each others votes.On June   the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet passed a resolution purporting to terminate the validity of the  Abkhaz constitution thereby returning to the  constitution which established Abkhazia merely in federation with Georgia. One month later on July   the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet declared sovereignty under the  constitution.Following several tense days in Sukhumi in June  in which armed groups assaulted the Minister of Internal Affairs of Abkhazia in his office the Georgian government under Shevardnadze which had just survived an attempted coup by Gamsakhurdias supporters in Tbilisi announced a political warning strike by radio demanding the dissolution of the Abkhaz parliament the resignation of the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic government and new elections for the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet. The Georgiangovernment cut electricity and telephone service to the Abkhaz capital Sukhumi for several hours on July   as part of its pressure campaign.The next day on July  an agreement was reached between Georgian and Abkhaz representatives subordinating all armed forces on the territory of Abkhazia to the Georgian Defense Ministry although daytoday control was to be exercised by the Abkhaz parliament and a military coordinating council. The Georgian Defense Ministry however was little more than a paper entity since the real fighting forces in Georgia nominally under the command of Shevardnadzes civilian government were Kitovanis National Guard and Ioselianis Mkhedrioni. MidJuly  through August  saw a series of armed actions in the civil war by Gamsakhurdia supporters which ultimately had great bearing on the outbreak of the Abkhaz war. On July   Gamsakhurdia forces reportedly blew up two bridges in western Georgia and laid siege to a school building where Mkhedrioni fighters were garrisoned the siege was finally broken by other Georgian troops.Still more importantly on July   Chairman of the Georgian governmental Committee for Human Rights and Interethnic Relations and key negotiator Aleksandre Kavsadze and other government officials were taken hostage by Gamsakhurdia forces and held in their home territory of Mingrelia in northwest Georgia near Abkhaz territory. On August   Georgian Interior Minister Roman Gventsadze and ten other Georgian officials who had gone to the town of Zugdidi in western Georgia a region of Gamsakhurdia supporters to negotiate the release of Kavsadze and other Georgian government hostages were themselves taken hostage by Gamsakhurdias forces. It appeared that the hostages were held in Kokhra village in the Gali region of Abkhazia. The Abkhaz interior minister after unsuccessfully negotiating for the hostages release announced that Georgian and Abkhaz soldiers would jointly conduct an operation to release the hostages. Meanwhile on August   the Georgian Interior Ministry Press Center announced that Georgian police officers were forming combat units under the command of Kitovani to go and free the hostages.On the night of August   a mechanized battalion of the Georgian National Guard commanded by Kitovani and comprised reportedly of about  men five tanks a helicopter and ten cannon entered the Gali region of Abkhazia avowedly for the purpose of releasing the thirteen Georgian government hostages. However the Georgian battalion went on from villages of the Gali region to the Abkhaz capital of Sukhumi where as detailed in the next chapter it attacked Abkhaz government buildings and proceeded after fierce but disorganized fighting to take the city. Thus open warfare began in Abkhazia.sourceCivil war started then Russia chose the side like West chose the Chechen side in RussianChechen war.,UkrainianConflict,cktxl2t,-2,t5_30hhs

Its purpose is to drive a wedge between Western parties and to reinforce Russian interests. They present their propaganda as alternative information. Like leeches they latch on and exploit freedom of expression to pedal their garbage. I have no problem with radical viewpoints. I have a problem with false viewpoints. Call a spade a spade dont try to convince us that the spade is actually a hammer. They feed this Americanbased selfhating movement that has sprung up in the West. This attempt to blame all Western governments to paint only the West as the invaders and terrorists while ignoring problems elsewhere. Suddenly Assad is not a ruthless dictator who suppressed his people hes now a source of stability in a sea of religious strife. Sounds awfully familiar to American policy of encouraging strongmen in the Middle East to keep stability.There are always halftruths in many RT stories. Yes Assad kept things stable but he was also a tyrant. Yes the Syrian War has attracted many Jihadists who see it as a way to establish a caliphate. But the Civil War started when Assad suppressed protests violently. Yes there are ultranationalist and nazi elements in Ukraine but there are far more in Russia and their effect is minimal at best. Yes Maidan had violent elements but there was no takeover of government just a deposition of the ultracorrupt president with the rest of government remaining relatively intact. A proWestern channel like RT that was against Russian interests would not be allowed to function in Russia which is the ultimate irony.

I dont know it so I cant say for sure what russia can currently do. For example they could have a clause that allows for delay of deliver for up to x month although I doubt it or that the costs are split  in case the export licence is denied which I find more plausible. I agree that ultimately one of your three options will happen but I dont believe that france is never going to deliver the ships or at least the first one. I think their aim is to delay until the political climate has improved. In that case they might even agree to be dragged in front of the WTO which would take about a year to settle according to them although France knows the game well enough and has enough support from other countries to find ways to drag it out longer Id say. Then when the crisis has cooled down sufficiently France can deliver the ship.

However the German President has a role which is more than ceremonial with the office being a genuine political office with extensive discretion regarding the way the President exercises his official duties. The Federal President gives direction to general political and societal debates and has some important reserve powers in case of political instability such as those provided for by Article  of the Basic Law. Under Article   of the Basic Law German Constitution the Federal President represents the Federal Republic of Germany in matters of international law concludes treaties with foreign states on its behalf and accredits diplomats. ...The Federal President by his actions and public appearances represents the state itself its existence its legitimacy and unity. The Presidents office involves an integrative role and the control function of upholding the law and the constitution. It is a matter of political tradition  not legal restrictions  that the Federal President generally does not comment routinely on issues in the news particularly when there is some controversy among the political parties. This distance from daytoday politics and daily governmental issues allows the Federal President to be a source of clarification to influence public debate to voice criticism offer suggestions and make proposals. In order to exercise this power he traditionally acts above party politics.from ,UkrainianConflict,cn3iai9,2,t5_30hhs

2847403,0,t3_2spner,My personal opinion.When I first heard about this incident and saw the initial videos I was  sure it was a Grad attack and the mine theory was stupid and simply a way to try and add some distortion and confusion to the obvious situation much like the air conditioner incident in Lugansk.After more information started coming out I changed my mind now I believe that the mine was responsible for the destruction of the bus.. I think it is safe to assume that there was a mine field around the check point there are pictures of careful mines next to the bus there  is a picture of a Ukrainian soldier carrying a mine MON  or  from the looks of it next to the destroyed bus as well. Obviously this doesnt mean anything by itself but we can stipulate that there is a mine field around check point.. There are videos where you can see the location of the grad impacts those impacts have been mapped.  The alleged grad hit on a bus ends up being slightly off the rest of the impact grid.  Once again just by itself it doesnt mean much.. The type of impacts. From the videos you can see several dozen grad impacts however two of them are very different and produce very noticeable fireballs one of those being next to the bus. Those fireball explosions are consistent with the ones produced by MON  anti personnel mines.. Video clearly shows a person running into the field next to the bus prior to explosion potentially setting of a mine.There are several more things but I mentioned all the important ones. Based on those things I have changed my mind I believe it is more likely that the mine is responsible for the destruction of the bus.However even if it was the mine the blame still lies squarely on the side that have launched the grads which caused a frightened person to run into the field next to the bus and activate a mine.,UkrainianConflict,cnrqz6s,4,t5_30hhs

2858494,0,t3_2susib,gtThe main reason Russia was able to annex Crimea and create havoc in Eastern Ukraine was not a lack of military assistance to Ukraine or the vague language of the Budapest memorandum. Rather Russia was able to take advantage of a weak state at a moment of severe political crisis and to exploit the discontent created by decades of bad government. It may be too late for Ukraine but future crises of this kind would be most reliably averted by strengthening governance and making sure that citizens have effective legitimate ways to deal with their grievances. The experience of Eastern Ukraine in fact showed just that The little green menarmed men in uniform without insigniafailed to take hold in the regions where citizens had some trust in the local authorities.gtThe nuclear dimension of the crisis is even more important.

Not according to the US Navy   Dont underestimate the effect of BNP Paribas either the French were furious after the fine they received they have been in Moscow talking about sanctions lifting     and they want to pay for gas with euros. If France the South European EU countries BRICS and some perpetually defaulting countries come out of the dollar that will be a  fall in usage.

After the fall of the Soviet Union Ukraines fleet of Ts were almost immediately mothballed for a few reasons. First was the massive almost instant cuts in defense spending. Second was that the T was built in ukraine so they had a factory to build replacement parts and preform upgrades whereas the T was built in Russia and with the large amount of Ts passed on to Ukraine it was just not economically feasible for Ukraine to keep maintaining and upgrading their fleet of Ts. However with the massive losses of TT tanks groups of volunteers have taken Ts out of mothballed status and built improvised after market parts to return these to status. The Ts that Ukraine is using is essentially the first generation version if the tank with maybe sometimes some reactive armor slapped on it which puts their tanks at a huge tactical disadvantage. Honestly the upgraded Ts that is the Ukrainians main battle tank is a better piece of equipment than a Ukrainian T.,UkrainianConflict,comtwf1,11,t5_30hhs

They planned this as a big embarrassment to Ukraine and Poroshenko but their initial assault was stopped in its tracks and cost them hundreds of troops and a good deal of equipment. Then Putin had to go to Minsk and pretend to support peace without having captured Debaltseve but he managed to buy them another few days time during which they still failed to capture the city. By this point there were Russian regular forces involved modern TB tanks Russian leadership being identified among the separatists etc. In the end they may have inflicted heavy losses on Ukraine but Ukraine was able to withdraw with some dignity. When you consider the high hopes Russia and the separatists had here this is a complete disappointment.Of course Poroshenko is going to say this was Ukraines Chosin Reservoir and I think thats an exaggeration. But even with the losses this fight has proved that Ukraine can defend itself. The other week separatists were cheering about going to Lviv Warsaw and to London.

In most successful cases of seizure the presence of well equipped men in military gear was noted.  If that is accomplished they move to seize police stations and acquire weaponry and effectively disarm the governments main agent of civil control. By seizing parliamentary buildings first it isolates the police and makes them more likely to surrender than resist.  After that is done well equipped Russian volunteers start to show up in significant numbers to assist the newly declared independent governments security forces protect itself against the junta.Kharkiv never got beyond stage one and only briefly did the protesters have control of the government building.

And safety in commercial civil aviation has very high standards  e.g. many flybywire planes have four separate computer systems and with every one of them its possible to fly the plane safely... Because of such high standards we saw a rapid decline of casualties in aviation over the last decades. Accidents normally dont just happen because one thing goes wrong but because a row of things gets wrong. And an encounter with a military plane or only the turbulence caused by it or a wrong reaction by the civil pilot could be one step of such a tragic development.,UkrainianConflict,cpqef17,1,t5_30hhs

Never been to Russia? The average consumer has a smart phone a laptop at their house flat screen TV ect. The wage is less but the prices of necessary goods are cheaper most Russians also dont rent which increases purchasing power for those goods.gtIts extremely feasible. Your also overplaying Russias significance. They have offices to oversee their products in the area. These can easily be moved to Finalnd or Estonia.

4074862,0,t1_crkmu9v,gtNobody is saying that the Russian view point is right. However choosing to ignore it leads to situations such as this. Dicks use violence when they need to.Throughout history empires would expand until the point of failure. smaller countries would get swept up in conflict and have their cultures and lives upended. The United states is unique in history in that it mostly doesnt do this. When Iraq and Afghanistan fell they didnt become us territories and their constitutions dont  require US allegiance. Instead of consolidating power the United States has tried to follow international law via the UN. If Russia feels that it can bully its neighborsthis goes against those standards of respecting sovereignty.No one is saying that the US doesnt understand the Russian view point but Russia or any other country on earth should not be exempt from international law. gtWhy? If they are failing to achieve their goals by diplomacy and the US conducts their foreign policy not considering shit actively blocking Russian interests why shouldnt Russia flip the table and stomp the shit out of Ukraine taking what they want by force?Because its a violation of another countrys sovereignty. A weaker country has the right to refuse the demands from a stronger one. If Ukraine chooses to increase its ties with Europe tough shit Russia.

So Duda probably dont want to be seen as continuator of Komorowski politics towards Ukraine at least untill parliament elections to please the right wing voters.Thats my analysis anyway. I think if Ukrainians want Polish support they would need to deal with these massacres at some point. Right wing in Poland is on rise recently still small percent of votes but they are important because without them neither PIS nor PO can win.

They tricked everyone and in few days earned  billion plus recovered  of its companies Serbian Daily Novosti reports.Prior to this part of the stocks of Russian energetic companies belonged to the foreign investors American and European which meant that almost half of the profit from oil and gas companies did not went to Russian treasury but to accounts of financial sharks in Europe writes Novosti.Because of the situation in Crimea ruble began to fall dramatically but Central Bank did nothing to support the exchange rate of ruble. Rumors appeared that Russia does not have sufficient money stock in order to support the exchange rate of ruble.Those rumors and Putins statement that he will protect Russian speaking population in Ukraine led to a dramatic fall in value of the stocks of Russian energetic companies and financial sharks suddenly started to sell the stocks on the stock market before they completely lost their value.Putin waited for an entire week and only smiled at press conferences and when the price of the stocks completely fell he ordered immediate purchase of all stocks which were in hands of Americans and Europeans.When financial sharks realized they were tricked it was already too late. Stocks were in Russian hands and not only that Russia made more than  billion that day but also recovered the stocks of its companies into Russian hands. Now all the profits made from oil and gas will stay in Russia and not go out of the country. Ruble will grow by itself and for its support it will not be necessary to spend golden reserves of Russia. European financial sharks remained with their heads bowed as fools  in a few minutes for pennies Russia bought stocks worth billions in profit from oil and gas.Such an extraordinary operation was not seen since the establishment of the stock market.,UkrainianConflict,crzb564,1,t5_30hhs

Some of these collaborationists committed the worst war crimes crimes against humanity and atrocities of the Holocaust gtCollaboration is a cooperation between elements of the population of a defeated state and the representatives of the victorious power.  Stanley Hoffmann subdivided collaboration into involuntary reluctant recognition of necessity and voluntary an attempt of exploiting necessity.  According to him collaborationism can be subdivided into servile and ideological the former is a deliberate service to an enemy whereas the latter is a deliberate advocacy of cooperation with the foreign force which is seen as a champion of some desirable domestic transformations.  In contrast Bertram Gordon used the terms collaborator and collaborationist for nonideological and ideological collaborations respectively. gtgtImage iInteresting Collaborationism | Municipality of Koevje | Puppet state | Turncoat Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcrzgrq oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecrzgrq.

Ive got Russian friends and I think Russia has a rich and beautiful history with all kinds of great people but their leader is a dickhead and their military is legitimately horrible. A military does not require fancy equipment to be useful but it does require skilled soldiers in properly spaced out leadership roles and Russia has been avoiding this for a long time now by just building the latest and greatest and showing it off every year to impress those who dont look further than the facts theyre fed on TV. Russia has a lot of bad soldiers filling their higher ranks who oppose genuinely useful change such as the adoption of a better service rifle than the AK series of weapons because it would mean more work for them in the form of retraining. Yeah glory to Ukraine and glory to every other nation that strives for it. Ukraine isnt shit in its entirety either but like Russia there are aspects of it that are beyond deplorable.

5797551,0,t3_3uixcx,I wonder how Russians are denying ground forces in Syria when they invited the press to the Russian MoD command centerwhat is it called? NDCC? and on a  meter tall screen showed that elements of the th Guards Artillery Brigade battery that is  of the Brigades  howitzers are deployed in Homs to provide fire support for the Syrian Army against ISIS positions in the MahinQuratyanPalmyra area. They created that entire map for the journalists. Russian artillery batteriesthey probably flew in more because of Turkey are sitting safely in the rear km behind the frontlinenobody in Syria employs counterbattery fire except for the Syrian Army. That the Russians insist their artillerymen are not conducting a ground operation because they dont make any direct contact with the enemy is pretty funny but its not entirely inaccurate. Either way there are practical reasons for maintaining a certain degree of secrecy regarding their troops in Syria and it has nothing to do with Russian motivations in Ukraine. In Ukraine their motivation was keeping under wraps their violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. In Syria the motivation is keeping their men safe. There are no legal considerations since they were invited into Syria by the internationally recognised government of Syria and there are no reasons to deceive the Russian population about Russian operations in Syria because the Russian population has been suffering from Islamic extremism for the last  years. Putin has and always will have the mandate from the Russian people to go and kill as many armed Jihadis as possible whether in Russia or abroad even if Russian soldiers lives are put at risk in the process. There is a civil war in Syria. Both sides are riddled with traitors and infiltrators. If Russians were open about their ground troops in Syria they would paint massive targets on their backs. They wouldnt only have to protect themselves from the  Mujahideen warlords operating in Syria but also American Turkish Saudi Qatari etc intelligence services traitors in the Syrian security apparatus and so on. The details of the full scale of Russias involvement in Syria are going to be published by the Russians only after the war is won and operational security is not a concern.As for the second part of the article there is no evidence that the  GRU servicemen they mentioned ever existed or if they existed whether they are dead and if they are dead where they died. Perhaps they died in a training accident in Russia? Perhaps they stepped on a mine in Ukraine during a recon mission? Perhaps they committed suicide?If they existed and died and died in Syria who says they died during a combat mission? GRU GShs role include a lot of things. In Syria GRU GSh are probably occasionally directing air or missile strikes. Thats not exactly fighting.

Regarding the domestic situation that may be true. However you should not overlook two points Maidan was all about changing exactly these patterns of behavior and the current reform is also about changing it even when of course its difficult to change behavioral patterns and the old elite resists change very much. But there are many Ukrainians who want to get rid of that playbook and these people. While in Russia these rules are still widely accepted and propagated as the norm and Putin who is the master of Soviet playbook is hailed. Thats also why Russia hates Ukraine currently so much because they are afraid of someone who doesnt want to play by that book any more and might set an example for Russia as well. Whats totally not identical is that Russia has attacked Ukraine and not the other way around. Russia is running of that book also regarding international relations and warfare.Ukraine had abolished their nuclear weapons and also conscription. They had no intentions to do harm to any of their neighbours or to even interfere into the politics of any other country. Thats the big difference.

The rebels have never had a successful operation without Russian army assistance.Following Minsk I Ukraine passed the law referenced in Minsk II On temporary Order of Local SelfGovernance in Particular Districts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. That is a concession made in good faith but one which the rebels and Russia werent happy with so they ratcheted up fighting until a renegotiation was necessary. Regardless nobody that I have heard of please correct me if Im wrong with citations on the rebel side has said that they are willing to give up their republics no matter what Ukraine does Ukraines attempts to pass laws to forward the settlement process have been met with derisive retorts about they can do whatever they want it doesnt apply to us. Thats not a negotiating position its removing yourself from the process. And they do it repeatedly.Autonomy is a tricky word and the devil is in the details. Political autonomy with having a local legislature and more budget managed locally etc might be possible but in Europe it doesnt really happen that regions have their own military. Will the rebels give those up? Regarding elections what about the IDP who fled the regions when armed thugs started taking over and airing proUkraine views could get you months of torture in the basement?

Thats Ukraine in a nuttshell.gtEven in Russias darkest days of the s do you really believe that they were isolationist and avoiding politics outside their territory?No that is very naive and in fact little changed in Ukraine and Russias relationship after the collapse. You know Crimea held a referendum or two about returning to Russia back in the s when that whole mess shouldve been resolved. Yeltsin was too drunk to care and Kiev told them to stfu or else theyll sent the tanks. That should ilustrate exactly how influential Russia was in that period and theres no need to talk about Kosovo US military bases in Central Asia NATO on their borders and whatnot. gtUkraine still took all trade deals offered only by Russia and looked at the oligarchy seizing power as the model to copy.No shit their whole economy was designed to work together with Russias.

The current jurisprudence is that unilateral state secession is unconstitutional but whether the constitution would be binding in such a case is clouded both by the dissent and by later commentary. It is also the consensus that unilateral territorial secession a states secession by consent of the other states or a unilateral state secession following a federal revolution ARE ALL constitutional. The case for reservations declaring sovereignty also has some legal support although this case hasnt been judicially tested. Furthermore advocating for such separation is constitutionally protected speech which means no law making the advocation of nonviolent separatism illegal even if such a law were passed by congress would hold up in court.

9433718,0,t1_d9bqgl2,Perhaps the best frame of reference for Russias and perhaps not incidentally Trumps tendency to turn the facts upside down is Peter Pomerantsevs theory that Putins advisor Surkov helped engineer an information model in which political gains can be made by confusing audiences about the notion that there is a such a thing as objective fact.Once youve sufficiently confused the audience about the objectivity of information you can more easily manipulate them and appeal to their prejudices. gt But at least the Soviets lies were meant to be coherent argues Peter Pomerantsev a journalist whose memoir of Mr Putins Russia is titled Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible. In a study in  for the Institute of Modern Russia a thinktank he quotes a political consultant for the president saying that in Soviet times if they were lying they took care to prove what they were doing was the truth. Now no one even tries proving the truth. You can just say anything. Create realities.gt In such creation it helps to keep in mindas Mr Putin surely doesthat humans do not naturally seek truth. In fact as plenty of research shows they tend to avoid it. People instinctively accept information to which they are exposed and must work actively to resist believing falsehoods they tend to think that familiar information is true and they cherrypick data to support their existing views.gt There is a strong case that in America and elsewhere there is a shift towards a politics in which feelings trump facts more freely and with less resistance than used to be the case. Helped by new technology a deluge of facts and a public much less given to trust than once it was some politicians are getting away with a new depth and pervasiveness of falsehood.

But to the Ukrainians the border is most important they want border control if they cannot do it without war they will go to war over it they do not try to hide it they boast how Russias economy is failing and or will fail and when it does they will use the opportunity to retake the Donbass.Reporter stated according to the minks agreements if the separatists comply with them it will also leave them in a bad positionStrelok replies Minks will not happen because Kiev does not recognize it Kiev will only recognize only the capitulation of the annexed areas and Donbass and Russias aggression.He stated that Russia made the mistake of thinking they can use the Donbass as a bargaining chip and force Ukraine to agree to certain concessions in return to having the Donbass returned with several concessions regarding the government rule of the area and in turn have Ukraine recognize Crimea as Russian. This did not happen and back fired for Russia.He rambles on about how Kiev violates the minsk agreement how Minks agreements were pro Ukrainian and that it allows Ukraine unchecked to recapture territories unchallenged.He goes on to state again Ukraine is a tool and an instrument used by the west the USA and their oligarchs dont care what happens to Ukraine it is just a tool of the west hence they will never allow Ukraine to make peace with Russia that their goal is to punish Russia hence we must destroy the tool which is Ukraine if we break the knife it cannot be used against us.Until Kiev government is overthrown and replaced with a proRussian one which has the interests of the Slavic people at heart nothing will change that will not impede on Russian speakers rights and respects their beliefs and until the realize Crimea is part of Russia war is inevitable.Reported stated I have one last question many people colleagues and just random strangers ask me why have you Strelok have not returned to Donbass.Strelok gives a long explanation of basically I left Donetsk to go to a confirmation hearing the roads were open when I came back Donetsk was completely encircled by the Ukrainian army..No the reason I left and the reason I was removed from the position is that I was completely against the Minsk  agreements and I was in control of ths of the fighting manpower the th were Cossacks and the other fighting units were not under my control at the time they were afraid I would not listen and try to take Mariupol instead of honoring the Minsk agreements they let me go hoping the agreements were last obviously they did not and I knew they would not last. And now we have the leadership DNRLNR created their own fiefdoms and republics instead of unifying they have spit in the decision of their country men and people within the republics. Instead of NovaRussia we have this fiefdoms being carved out. So why should I join them? Those village idiots are carving individual cities as fiefdoms why would I want to go back and fight for that?! Tell me what reason would that serve? And who is gonna put me in charge? Or should I join their dead comrades that died by their hand assuming SBU and or DNRLNR or should I kill myself here and save myself time and money? There is one other option the separatists tell me if you come back we will rally behind you and overthrow the leadership we will tear them apart and give power people back to the people. So If I do go back vilate the minsk agreements than we will have a full blown war with Ukraine and also PMCs. How many people will die due to this? But at least they can try to blame it on me..No no way I will not be the fall guy for this failed plan. Strelok then gets heated and looks into the camera at  an d basically says You guys betrayed the Donbass Poroshenko is a blood soaked terrorist you made this shit sandwich youre gonna have to take a bite crude analogy of what he said when you admit that Poroshenko is a bloody terrorists than we can talk and I will be happy to act and assist.End of interview,UkrainianConflict,ddl5oyb,9,t5_30hhs

11680696,0,t1_dgizjjo,The bitching is because Russia isnt going to make Batumi out of Donetsk. Its going to militarize the fuck out of it just like every territory where it helps Russianspeaking locals. Theres not a single territory that Russian annexed thats doing better than before. Batumi is doing great while Abkhazia sucks balls. Even Ukrainian Odessa is building a new airport terminal for all of the tourists that started to flood it after Crimean annexation. Russia simply squeezes life out of its annexed territories. These territories now serve as hotspots that work as staging grounds for further invasion. Watch Creeping occupation report by Vice where it shows exactly how Russia is increasing its presence and continues to work through salami tactics and takes more and more of Georgias territory. If by some miracle someone is able to provide a  guarantee that Donbas will not be a militarized outport for Russias imperialistic desires and it will not invade Ukraine any further  most of us eg Ukrainians who were forced to leave would be happy to give it up and Im sure the rest of Ukraine would eventually agree to that too. I wont even ask for a compensation for my home and other property that I had to abandon I promise. But the truth is its not going to happen. Donbas has to be contained otherwise Russia will spread like cancer and continue to destabilize Ukraine. ,UkrainianConflict,dgk0uwy,11,t5_30hhs
