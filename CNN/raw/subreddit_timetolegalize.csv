3181297,0,t1_coroufc,Ok the  licensing fee keeping small businesses out of the game is a fair critique.Although anyone using Cannabis for medical purposes is already in the underground and not telling anyone about it. To legalize its use for certain medical conditions would alleviate the fear of prosecution for anyone suffering from those conditions. But I imagine for those whose conditions are not on the acceptable use list their lives would go on exactly as it did previous to SB.And we all agree that artificially inflated prices due to heavy taxation suck for the consumer. But you know what REALLY sucks for the consumer? Getting sucked into the criminal justice system.So sure it could be better. But ANY resolution to decriminalize or legalize Cannabis in any format has a netpositive effect on the movement as it has historically been a stepping stone to more favorable legislation.,timetolegalize,corqo4w,2,t5_2tr4p

I hate that so many of my party think that the war on drugs should continue or that it is the govts responsibility to police what happens in the privacy of my own house.I also hate that my elected representative Ted Deutch   a Democrat has stated that he wont  vote to legalize.  Our two senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson are equally as uncooperative in reflecting what the people want.  I didnt vote for any of these people.

5674359,0,t1_cx0bft1,The website linked in the article shows a total of  registered dispensaries when you sort by those that are selling recreationaly or at least approved to sell rec there are  as the article states. The state website explicitly states that these are dispensaries not simply all marijuana businesses.
