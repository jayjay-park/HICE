382936,0,t1_cfeuesu,if only for  years? Renting might be best. The housing market has lifted barely but in the next  years? I would check with a realitor in out area. Sadly in the good areas by the beach and in Rossevelt Park or Norton shores the rentels are limited but good if you can find one. Id skip on muskegon school district if just for kindergarten. You would be better off in any other district on that aspect. Keep in mind in our area you have school of choice. as long as you are here by summer timeI do not know the dead line no matter where you live you can pick any school. Of course if you do not live in the district you ahve to bring them instead of buses picking your child up. Glad to have a family move to Muskegon. Good Luck! Let me know if you need anything else info or what not.,Muskegon,cfkgfyu,1,t5_2s6ks
