8627733,0,t3_4xlfua,I think Stardoms consistency has a lot to do with them being so high.  Not many promotions can put on quality shows so frequently.  Not every show is amazing but I cant think of a bad show theyve done. ,stardomjoshi,d6k2juq,1,t5_3epmj

9259471,0,t1_d8p140s,He was the Osaka show on  Tessas last show. He was sitting on the background stage off to the side next to Will Ospreaywho was wearing a red cap and a NY TShirt. Ricochet is a little bit hard to see because he is right behind one of the ring posts but you get a few glimpses of him through out the show.,stardomjoshi,d8ppdy4,3,t5_3epmj
9490994,0,t1_d9ivyt8,Its crazy that Okada cant talk about a girlfriend for fear of women fans abandoning him. Its kinda sad actually. No dont shorten your thoughts on my account. I could literally sit and talk all day about joshi. Fujimoto and Nakajima in NXT would be fucking incredible although i imagine Billie Kay would start being mouthy and Arisa would forearm her to death. I dont WWE have any personal spite against Stardom. Stardom are too small to be any threat at all. I hope that the upcoming tournament that is rumoured has loads of joshi and they come in to NXT and turn everyone else upside down and shake their lunch money out of them. Absolutely dominate everyone. The main roster worries me more. That creative team will drop the ball completely. I think that Stardom might get some publicity out of it so thats a plus i guess. I have no idea who is going to win the IoBito match and i love that i dont know. I cant choose. I agree that Kairi wont get the red belt unless she is staying.,stardomjoshi,d9iyutm,2,t5_3epmj

10160698,0,t3_5lfnbo,Great post. I got into Stardom last year and its quickly become one of my top  favourite promotions alongside NJPW and PWG. Id known of Io Shirai before so knew how great she was but Mayu Iwatani has also blown me away I cant recall the last time ive seen a  year old with such potential and ability. Seeing her finally win the Red Belt in  has the potential to be a top  wrestling highlight of the year. And Kairi Hojo is amazing her feud with Meiko Satomura was fantastic brings so much emotion to her matches reminds me of Bret Hart in that sense that she knows how to bring a sense of drama and emotion to a match and this is no knock on the legendary Randy Savage or great Okada but her elbow drop is the best ever in my opinion. Just a thing of beauty.The Rookie Class is also a perfect opening act watching Azumi Starlight Kid Arisu Nanase etc is so fun. Makes it rewarding to follow their careers if they hopefully go onto big things in the future. Azumi cracks me up shes brilliant.I had wanted to ask a couple of random questions recently so this thread might be a better place to ask Are the wrestlers sponsored in the same way you see guys in NJPW? Do super fanssupporters pay for their dinnersdrinks after shows etc? I occasionally see pics on twitter of the Stardom roster having dinner together but it looks more like its put together by the company itself. Probably a dumb question as I imagine they still need to complete their education but are the Rookie ClassKidsunder s full time wrestlersin training or do they still go to schoolcollege? I saw the pic of Momo Watanabe winning her  Most Improved award in a school uniform and assumed at first it was just be a costume for the event but then thought she might have finished school for the day to go pick up her award with Io Shirai haha   It was good to see Stardom recently getting mainstream attention on TV Asahi and the growth the company has had is there much possibility of any crossover with other Japanese companies in the future?,stardomjoshi,dbvrsek,3,t5_3epmj
10424784,0,t3_5pakee,The best thing about Naito to me is how real he feels... if theres one thing he does that wouldnt feel right to the character he incorporates that mess up into the character. What I always do this this makes it feel real as people arent characters and have a range of emotions and such. Between him and Omega I really think NJPW has the most BELIEVABLE roster as far as characters,stardomjoshi,dcppv5c,2,t5_3epmj
10698371,0,t1_ddjeiml,Kagetsu Momo and KLR werent as strong as they are now in terms of kayfabe at time of defense though. Kairi has had to beat the most active defender of the belt in Santana to win it after losing to her  not to mention Santana beat Io for it. She also had Viper to face.  Its not an afterthought Stardom just havent got enough people who could believably challenge Kairi outside of Bito Storm and now Konami and Kagetsu at a push. Its more just a booking mistake. Its different for High Speed because its lower card and a lower card person can conceivably hold it so theres more options. Just compare how easy it is to believe Momo can beat Mayu for it over HZK beating Kairi for the Wonder title despite both receiving comparable pushes whilst both champs are about the same in kayfabe.,stardomjoshi,ddjgh5a,1,t5_3epmj

11014662,0,t1_defd7o7,Yeah...id have had Hashimoto ahead of her. Also I rate Junkyo higher than Rachel Ellering. But oh well people dont watch joshi.,stardomjoshi,deghbnh,3,t5_3epmj
