1440827,0,t1_ciwtyul,i do think that the tournament pointing should be revised too. zaun and bc lost  points piltover lost  as second place. and demacia won  as first thaats a huge difference and seems a bit stupidedit i counted as the standard  points for each match and the tournament win bonusedit i saw a request for change in the point reviews. I want the changes for future arcs not this one. Lets just put this arc to rest and focus on the future,leaguefactions,ciwvu8u,3,t5_318io
1440907,0,t1_ciwope8,if piltover would win bc would get  of the pyrikhos anyway,leaguefactions,ciww76s,1,t5_318io
1445700,0,t1_cix7kgv,I like this idea. Bilgewater hasnt had a direct roll in things as of yet so seeing what they might do is interesting. Of course keeping Ceruleana out of things would definitely be a nice bonus.,leaguefactions,cixhtk9,1,t5_318io
1455426,0,t1_cixu1m5,maybe this criminal group is like a mafia faction that is definitely doing illegal activities but is too well established as an organisation to be stopped by simple military sweep. Perhaps this faction is threatening to take major trade routes i.e. if it owns bilgewater it can control sea traffic. also we can use the league to determine criminal power in towns obviously  game wouldnt pass complete ownership to a faction so that allows for partial bonuses to each side depending on how much of town each side owns. One problem I see with this is that multiple factions can unite to take them on like the Bandover alliance in which the crime faction would get decimated unless  they had a significant advantage like a larger roster in that certain situation or research directed towards reducing the effectiveness of and possibly discouraging the formation of alliances. I could tell that with Zaun last arc a lot had to be done to make its chances of winning slim and it sure was! But I have a feeling that the crime faction would be somewhat an underdog but would only be doing well since all the cities have been weakened from recent events.In some ways its a similar war like a voidpocalypse but that felt too serious the world was going to end if the void won... and a criminal arc win would still allow the governments to take back what has been stolen. I dont think there is a problem in finding enough to fill a criminal roster bilgewater has a lot of champs in itself but there are still other champs that can join in without becoming a disaster like piltover from last arc.Like I said earlier league matches can be used to determine what criminals are trying to take andor what enforcers are trying to protect and take back. Perhaps a  control of piltover allows for only half the set probability of advancing in research stages as opposed to  control. Maybe depending the division of noxus militaries are strengthened by a certain amount. This gives a chance for each faction to strategise about what cities are important to their respective goals. I know Im rambling a lot and it even confuses me a bit. But everything I have here is just stuff I thought up and maybe youd like to take some aspects for whatever you decide in the end. I dont really have a preference to this or any other idea on this page yet and Im sure whatever you guys come up with by August will be much better thought out!,leaguefactions,ciypody,1,t5_318io

1540187,0,t1_cj9a50e,What Im thinking for Aatrox hell be a potential universal pickup but hell come with a cost.Quick draft not ready for primetime yetAatrox is available as a Tertiary Champion for any faction that is currently in last place or in secondtolast place and within  points of the lastplace faction. He comes at a significant price. Aatrox is known as a being who thrives on warfare and bloodshed. Although he is a Champion of the League the Council is understandably wary of him and any faction that would make him an ally. The petition to add Aatrox automatically invokes the Burn Favor rules. Aatrox bears a cosmic imprint of strife and conflict that infects the faction he joins. Aatrox increases the factions Danger Level by . Aatrox reduces the factions Favor gains from any source by  for the rest of the arc.He does however come with a special ability to help even the odds Before each set of Featured Matches in which Aatroxs faction is involved he must issue a challenge to a specific enemy Champion. He must declare his foe  hours beforehand. Generally this will be arranged by consensus if necessary well use a poll or randomly select someone. He will meet this Champion in battle on the Howling Abyss before the first match of the day. Winner first blood  CS tower or most CS at . The enemy Summoner must be of equal or lesser rank to Aatroxs Summoner. If Aatrox wins the enemy Champion is banned for that set of Featured Matches. If Aatrox loses he is out of play for that set and his faction loses  Balance of Power to the enemy.Thats just a random idea though.,leaguefactions,cj9c507,1,t5_318io
