11357209,0,t3_5ywfqr,I want to see what people like about this game because I dont get it. I currently play Dominations. The biggest difference between the two is the ability to actually design your own base. This forces defensive and offensive creativity that I dont see with Evony. Can someone prove me wrong? Are these prebuilt MMORTS as strategic as the custom built bases in clash of clans or Dominations like games? To me it is a matter of math. If my army is stronger than your base.... I win.,Evony_TKR,dfjbhkc,1,t5_3i9ug
