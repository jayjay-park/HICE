2175967,0,t1_clfparc,Sorry didnt see your reply until much later and I agree with you.  Thats why I included their score at the bottom of my comment since Polygon seems to have a real issue being objective and instead pull out the paint by numbers sexism checklist.If a game is abhorrently sexist or disgusting then definitely mention it in the review and discuss what thoughts exist about it and how it could be better.  But Polygon seems to subscribe to that Gawker style of writing where its easier to just coat everything with the same broad brush treat everything as a springboard to confirm bias and any critical thinking is either overrated or requires too much effort.,Bayonetta,clgf29l,3,t5_2u8gb

2257084,0,t1_clqbw9m,Im starting to think Ive been lied to. Why on Earth would they say that kind of nonsense to me? The guy I talk to even mentioned that he had dealt with a lot of angry international customers. I really really wish I had received that transcript. Right now I feel like a fool.But yeah the game is really awesome right? ,Bayonetta,clqp3au,1,t5_2u8gb
3602732,0,t3_31m55f,Lots of games. RPGs and survival horror are my favorites. My current inprogress games are Tales of Symphonia Alien Isolation and Fantasy Life.,Bayonetta,cq2xqw5,1,t5_2u8gb
5956391,0,t1_cy0eqev,They might have not been able to make her measurements exactly with the engine theyre using. Bear in mind Bayo s engine is FAR different from Smash Bros. ,Bayonetta,cy0ewc2,1,t5_2u8gb

6730254,0,t3_47st0c,Watched until Ive never played Bayonetta . Thanks.,Bayonetta,d0fgty9,4,t5_2u8gb
8060864,0,t3_4pjuc2,Nice video!Re comprehending the story Im pretty sure that one is meant to play Bayonetta several times so the story is purposely convoluted so that it becomes clearer on ones nth playthough. Of course Bayonetta  makes the story even better magically enough.In terms of the bland environment I wonder if its lessinteresting for people who live in actualEurope since its very purposely invoking a fauxItaly setting in order to be novel.,Bayonetta,d4m47ix,1,t5_2u8gb
8132952,0,t1_d4u7hdh,I have left reddit for a reddit alternative due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.     The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumpedup charges.     The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO despite initial hopes has continued the same trend.     As an act of protest I have chosen to redact all the comments Ive ever made on reddit overwriting them with this message.     If you would like to do the same install TamperMonkey for Chrome GreaseMonkey for Firefox NinjaKit for Safari Violent Monkey for Opera or AdGuard for Internet Explorer in Advanced Mode then add this GreaseMonkey script    Finally click on your username at the top right corner of reddit click on the comments tab and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.     After doing all of the above you are welcome to join me on a reddit alternative,Bayonetta,d4u7ttm,2,t5_2u8gb

11163974,0,t1_dex3ie6,Then dont bother remembering? Off the top of my head I only really remember PKP and PPKKK. I really dont get what your problem is every combo is pretty much going to end with a wicked weave or launching someone in the air. We cant improve your memory you know.,Bayonetta,dexfaqh,4,t5_2u8gb
11542245,0,t3_64qu6n,Alright SEGA. Im gonna need Bayonetta  on Steam as well.,Bayonetta,dg4bcvl,1,t5_2u8gb
11543400,0,t1_dg4fr29,Cant complain too much. Without them we wouldnt have Bayo  and would therefore have no hope for Bayo ,Bayonetta,dg4g2eo,22,t5_2u8gb

11673290,0,t1_dgic2d5,if i play a game and get high marks on every mission for my first playthrough that tells me that theres very little no room for improvement on my end. that wont stop me from liking the game i just wont go for a nd playthrough. i love the DMC and god of war series but dont replay as much as bayonetta for this reason.i think youre putting too much thought into the medal at the end and not actually paying attention to the game. did you enjoy the process of dieing  times then figuring out the mechanic enough to gold medal the fight? i know i do. and afterwards ill replay the entire chapter to see if i can put those newly learned skills to use without dieing to get a better overall medal. if bayonetta was exactly the same game but gave you a gold star after completing every chapter would you like it more? ,Bayonetta,dgj6mcc,1,t5_2u8gb
11729423,0,t1_dgp9bh6,Yep. Bayonetta  was in limbo for a while but I imagine Platinum getting more money off of the success of NieR Automata and Bayonetta PC port could allow Bayonetta  to get put on more platforms. ,Bayonetta,dgpk6zr,5,t5_2u8gb
