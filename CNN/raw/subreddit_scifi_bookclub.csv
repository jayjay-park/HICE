8876872,0,t1_d7e5aql,Personally yes I found Revelation Space to be very heavy very slow and ultimately unrewarding. Having said that I still liked it. The ideas in there are incredible the characters are appropriately fucked up and the universe he is building is amazing. But  its his debut novel and it shows. He just gets better as he goes. Chasm City is in some ways a lot lighter and more colourful. I cant quite explain why but RS to me is grey and black where C City is bright and shiny  go figure! Chasm City is of course much more than the city itself which is an amazing place to explore and the Sky Haussmann elements really give the story depth and complexity. This to me is a stunning piece of writing. Love it.,scifi_bookclub,d7evi7n,2,t5_2s7vt
