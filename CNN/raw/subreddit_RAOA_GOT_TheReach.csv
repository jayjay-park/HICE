7934854,0,t1_d47y99o,Too much. Its half past bedtime in my time zone now so Ill have to sleep soon. I just really want our group to win this. ,RAOA_GOT_TheReach,d47yala,2,t5_3ey1d

7944322,0,t1_d48m14j,The Iron Islands I messaged the leader to ask what he hoped to achieve with such an alliance because we discussed it might be good to know more about it before we accept anything.The Westerlands u has been in contact with their leader and she has said she will be up for discussing it after work her time which is probably in roughly  hours just looking at time zones.This is a problem for us as I have to deliver the battleplan before I go to sleep and I hope to go to sleep in around  hours. I have an exam tomorrow so I cant push it today and I am sorry for that. What do we do? Wait with alliances and focus on defence this round? See what the others do?,RAOA_GOT_TheReach,d490l6s,1,t5_3ey1d
