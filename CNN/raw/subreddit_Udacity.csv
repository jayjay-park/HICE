6352094,0,t3_41v1mt,Hey!The Ruby on Rails Nanodegree program will cover Ruby on Rails HTML CSS and JavaScript. That program should be available this spring. The Beginning Ruby Nanodegree program which is currently available covers the fundamentals of Ruby the command line interface and Git amp GitHub.The main goal of the Beginning Ruby Nanodegree program is to build a solid practical understanding of object oriented programming with Ruby. Too often courses teach what OOP is at a conceptual level but quickly move on before you get a chance to actually use classes and objects.So the way Id frame it is Beginning Ruby teaches everything up until you get to the web. The Ruby on Rails Nanodegree starts with the web and teaches everything you need to become job ready.The Beginning Ruby Nanodegree would be for you if youre new to programming or new to Ruby.Hope that helps!,Udacity,czbnv47,1,t5_2tf86

9997978,0,t3_5iqgiv,Hey! So if you havent done any Java before Android Basics hit up  though itll overlap a bit with Android Basics. If your Java is good to go you can jump right in to      You can totally do the projects ahead of time enroll and submit em all at once. Not shady at all. Hope you stick with it!,Udacity,dbark0v,3,t5_2tf86
