1164374,0,t3_27fdbs,i can share a bit of perspective herei moved from a dsjTB drive to a dsTB drive recently.i wanted i wanted to keep everything on my  full TB drive and transfer the files to the TB drive.the partitions on a synology are linux based  so i tried cloning the partitions under windows  with a variety of tools didnt work because how windows handles discs over TB.i ended up having to let the new synology install itself on the TB drive then take that out and stick it together with the TB drive inside my pc.i then used a gparted live linux distro to copy every individual partition of the TB drive into the newly created partition of the TB drive.after starting i had to repair a few packages on the new synology but the filestructure was there.now onto your special casethe synology is unable to preserve any partitions different than its own structure on the drive  you cant stick the ntfs formatted drive into the NAS as the synology will not recognize the structure and will delete your ntfs partition.what you could do is the following take any drive lets call this A larger than GB stick it in your synology. initialize the synology with the latest DSM . take your now initialized drive and stick it into your pc with the TB drive lets call this Byou have. boot with gparted live linux distribution resize the TB partition on B down to .TB move it to the end of the drive copy over all partitions from drive A to the start on drive B resize the third etx partition that you copied over to larger than .TB here it gets a little tricky  you know need an os than can read ntfs and write to ext filesystem.basically you copy over that data from the ntfs partition to the ext position then delete the ntfs partition you also risk losing all data if you did something wrong somewhere and resize the etx partition to fill up the drive. then you would need to move all the filestructure on the ext partition into the filestructure that the synology is using volume after you created the shared folders folders the NAS OS can see and you would then have all files easily accessable on your synology.TLDR  so you see  this is highly complicated and i would advise to move the data onto a separate drive and copy it to your synology after the nas has initialized the tb drive inside it.,synology,ci0m0rz,1,t5_2s4co

Not familiar with unlink Ill look into it.gtthe nested for in argument parsing could perhaps be avoided using grep funcion?This was a part of the code that I used from the existing script. I left it as it is because it worked and as I said I am new to perl so didnt want to go around making extra work for myself. I may look into this later though.gtwriting a few lines for logging would make this script selfreliant and help people who do not have logging module installedI found a few posts arround the place with people using the same logging module so I decided to leave the code in for that even though Im not using it personally. I probably wont bother implementing my own but Ill ink to the original in the inital post so that anybody who wants it can install it.gtjust a thought you dont actually need to read database  just scan downloads folder for any MKVs without corresponding MPs. Also Id check the docs doesnt DS have parameters it calls your script with? If yes the file name would certainly be among them.I didnt want the script to try to process partially completed files hence the DB calls. For the next revision I will put in an option to scan the entire video directory though. Some people might prefer to have it like that and run it as a sheduled task once per day while they know there are no files still downloading or running it like that once when moving in a large library.I actually couldnt find any docs for this. All the information regarding the DB calls and setting up the script to run came from the synology forums. But I dont think it passes anything or else the script would quit during the arguments section when it didnt match up?Sickbeard allows you to run a script on completion and that definitely passes some information include the filename episode number etc. If I decide to run sickbeard then Ill write a script for that which should only need to be  lines or so.Cheers for the tipsChris,synology,ck2ajri,1,t5_2s4co

5506931,0,t1_cwfjucq,Nope definitely not those.  In my day job Ive got a couple of enterprise class SANs capable of hardware snapshots and we barely use them.  IMO the utility of VMwares snapshotting is far more versatile than LUN based snapshots.  Particularly if your datastores are large and you have a lot of VMs per datastore.  LUN snapshotting has its place but the idea is actually more appealing than its utility.  The most useful way weve been able to leverage them is for backing up really busy VMs with a high rateofchange.  Well capture the VM snap with an immediate hardware snap and backup from that.  It keeps the VM snap open for a minimal amount of time so the deltas are small and we dont have to put additional load on the VM hosts.,synology,cwfk7mt,2,t5_2s4co

This doesnt affect anything at all except if I happen to tell PMS to refresh a library at that very moment  the result is that PMS scans my library sees some files missing and I guess deletes the metadata then begins restoring the metadata files as if I had just added those movies to my library.  This has happened to me twice so far once where it thought about  of my movies which had been there were suddenly brand new and another time where it was about half my library or  movies.

Drop a power supply on the expansion unit and your out of action.. Accidentally pull out the power supply of the DX unit?  Degraded volume.. Dont expect a future migration from a  setup to a newer  bay will be a walk in the park. It wasnt for me when going from a DS amp DX to what I have now.. Noise. I found the DX expansion box to be noisy and even with upgraded Noctua fans it was still loud.My advice is to think ahead and budget yourself for the best you can afford.

10380931,0,t1_dck84il,gt am always hesitant to recommend Synology if the user isnt tech savvy and doesnt have other needs.Based on my personal experience a Synology is probably going to be the most user friendly of all NVRs out there even for people with little to no knowledge of IT. Its entirely GUI based no command line and easy to setup.To answer your question we use two types of NVRs depending on the level of security needed but both rely on Synology hardware for standard clients we use an Axis IP camera network with Synologys Surveillance Station as an NVR and we choose the Synology model based o the number of cameras well be using the NAS must be powerful enough to manage X many cameras. The most common model we use is the DS which can manage up to  cameras.For certain clients or where theres a heightened security risk a complex security scenario very special cameras or anytime we have over  cameras in a system we use an AXIS NVR with paired Synology NAS for secure storage.To date never had a single issue with either setup. Really not to sound like a broken record but Synology NAS really do apply to pretty much any scenario big or small intense or not.,synology,dckqr20,2,t5_2s4co

I installed very few Package Center apps since I mostly just use Docker versions of the same available apps. If you plan on using Docker then GB or GB may not be enough based on what you want to run or would like to run in the future.Also the DS has an Intel processor which is great for running most xx compiled applications.As for popular docker containers I started with using exclusively LinuxServer.io containers which are very well built and a great place to start as they offer good howtos for them.,synology,dg5ybe5,2,t5_2s4co

11635409,0,t1_dge4d6b,RAID is twodrive redundancy but its redundancy is definitely not twice that of RAID. This takes a little bit of explanationMathematically a single TB drive with a  URE unrecoverable error rating has a  percent possibility of encountering an error during rebuild.   URE drives are at  possibility.   URE drives are lt. When a healthy parity array RAID or RAID encounters an unrecoverable error under btrfs it SHOULD be repaired immediately without a parity rebuild.  But if a drive totally fails the parity stripes must be rebuilt.  A subsequent read error by ANY drive during the rebuild will fail the entire array RAID or invoke the second parity copy RAID. We arent too far off from drive capacities where a third parity copy will statistically be needed to be confident of array integrity during rebuild.RAID is a striped and mirrored configuration and is the fastest redundant configuration.  All the spindles return  usable data on a read.  Again a healthy btrfs RAID should correct any read error immediately from the mirror copy.  A complete drive failure in RAID only requires rebuild from its mirrored drive.  If there is a read error during remirroring the only impact is to the file affected by that error  not the array.  This is a substantially lower aggregate risk to your data.Im really not a fan of parity arrays anymore.  Drives are too cheap and the risks of large drive parity arrays are too high.  I always RAID or RAID drives larger than TB.  Eventually we will abandon RAID parity amp mirroring altogether and just use offsite replication as the sole source of redundancy although striping  i.e. RAID   may still be used for performances sake.For your production unit do an drive RAID TB usable on a single volume and just configure shared folders for work and archive.  Your performance will suffer if you use multiple volumes as two caches must be maintained and you dont leverage as many spindles.  Just to remind a second volume should be created if you add an expansion unit.You might make a case for the offsite DS to use a SHR array saving  drives for the same TB space should be  drives.  Although for the cost of two drives you can match the production RAID configuration exactly and have a backup physical platform you can retrieve and just put straight into production if you have a DS hardware failure.Regarding snapshots hourly snapshots with daily replication would probably work well for your setup.  You dont need to do additional local snapshots on the backup unit just set it up to receive replicated snapshots.,synology,dgevx6q,1,t5_2s4co
11680404,0,t1_dgjvdgz,So do you think that RAID  is the safest option because it can rebuild the data faster? The chance that  drives on different arrays fails is not that big right? Also how big is the chance that a HDD will break down without any signs? Wont the software on the diskstation notice some errors before a HDD dies? ,synology,dgjznzt,1,t5_2s4co
11688655,0,t3_66sik1,Xpenology fan checking in!You can start an SHR array with just one disk though thats completely unprotected and grow it by adding more disks as required. You can move data onto the SHR as you go. When I bought my HP MicroServer I was waiting on a backorder of drives to arrive. So I ran up my Xpenology NAS with only a single GB desktop drive. It now runs x TB NAS drives ... and its the same volume I started with. I just added in the new drives one at a time. Process took a few days to get done but it worked and saved me reloading stacks of data.Of course I took the precaution of backing up my photo collection. Everything else was replacable if things went pearshaped. I wouldnt try to juggle data if you dont want to risk losing it. But then you should backup anyway right?If it were me Id add the SSDs in last. Youre aiming to get the data safely stored first so add the biggest drive to the array first and when you run out of SATA ports or bays remove the smallest drives first. ,synology,dgkxdoe,2,t5_2s4co
