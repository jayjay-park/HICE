10092664,0,t3_5kazvk,Fucking hell thats an aggressive article. Dont get me wrong Im not really a fan of Metal Hammer but the thought of these seventy three people out of work before Christmas made my heart sink. Especially when they were doing what was probably their dream job.It doesnt matter what bands you like I thought the the Metal community always stuck together. Theres always a general vibe that people would always help others out. This deathmetal.org on the other hand or at least that author looks fucking toxic and reminds me of the kid at school who thinks theyre better than everyone else because they like something different.The worst thing about this article attacks the exemployees as shills and aggressively points out which companies it feels should next be in the firing line. Everyones entitled to their own opinion but to be actively hoping for people to loose their job is just horrendous and unprofessional.,black_metal,dbn39a0,4,t5_2qlhv
