3772050,0,t1_cqm66qj,Ah thats what I thought I was reading. Why not just get w acdc drivers? Not raggin just curous. They can be had for about  a pop. Granted its a little more expensive however it would be far less wiring no dealing with boosters and it would run each LED at the actual w. I had a similar setup to you much smaller scale. I eventually ditched all the v PSUs and boost convertors in favor of the all in one drivers much less messy imo. As you mentioned the caps on the boosters like to blow which was annoying and time consuming to be replacing them. I have actually had good results with the w drivers. Only dead one I have had was DOA when I got it. Only annoying thing I have found is most dont have proper grounding but this can easily be fixed. Fair warning to anyone who reads this and wants to use w drivers there are a lot of fake ones on ebay. Claiming w but in reality only put out . If you dont want to do maths just grab a killawatt to check the pull.,Head2HeadMG,cqm8p3d,1,t5_33ttr
