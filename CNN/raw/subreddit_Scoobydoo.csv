5331757,0,t3_3o03za,I really want to do a real Scooby Doo movie unlike anything done before. I want to make it gritty and believable where you see the team now and the team as it forms. You know something gritty and raw like in the spirit of True Detective. The first one. I have most of the synopsis all worked up already. Reporter interviewing one of the first cartoon villains. In this movie the cartoons are actually being shown. Theyre fully aware of the movies made about them and about all the cartoons. Only in this movie all the criminals theyve taken down over the years have all been connected.Oh and in my movie there is no real ghost and demons. Theyre all huge cons just like the original Scooby doo cartoons intended. Theyre detectives. Theyre not stumbling on random capers. Theyre playing cat and mouse with a crime syndicate no one but them believes exist and theyre working to dismantle it.What do you think?,Scoobydoo,cvt6wym,1,t5_2s431
