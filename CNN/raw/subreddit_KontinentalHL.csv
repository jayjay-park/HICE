2308098,0,t1_clwuxj4,Yeah as Buddhas said they would but I personally think that better league  better attendance. Since Slovenia is very into winter sports it wouldnt be tough to fill up Stoice at least not below  people. And I recall Medveak being in a tough financial spot too when they had to join KHL. I hope that the league administration will think about adding Olimpija.,KontinentalHL,clwzwwz,3,t5_2uy1o

6602790,0,t1_d024ab4,gt True but i think the average KHL player is better than the average AHL player.THat cannot be argued. The top end of the KHL skews the average up. The KHL player is better on average than the AHL player. Your Kovys Radulovs Voynovs ect cannot be found in the AHL and are easily better than AHL quality.However in terms of onice product the AHL is consistently better hockey. A battle between the Hartford Wolfpack and Manitoba Moose will give us better hockey than will one between Vityaz and Amur. Its debatable either way but I really think the AHL is a bit better.,KontinentalHL,d02a753,1,t5_2uy1o

10211102,0,t3_5m695m,I dont like any of these really. And the NHL isnt the ony snowflake league. The KHL has plenty of divergence from the IIHF in the rule book. Business and best practices for large leagues like the NHL AHL and KHL is not the same as for the small nation elite leagues. Its simply not comparable. . You vastly overstate the occurrence impact and even implementation of defensive fore and back check in late game situations. Hockey isnt soccer. You cant pack the slot as one parks the bus in soccer. It doesnt work. Behind the net play and modified s and s are far too effectual at ripping seems in man backchecks. Possession is FAR more valued and emphasized in hockey and every team in the league understands possession time as a defensive stat. Turtling as you call it would lead to a stacking shot count and mounting defensive zone time which again unlike soccer where the stat is mostly useless due to deflections and netfront play in hockey a rising shot count is inherently dangerous. No one stops playing and packs the slot in the NHL. Some teams will defend a late lead like a man PK but even then theyll still run their break out and play all three zones unlike soccer where its hump the ball hopefully to an isolated forward and leave  men back.. Not only would this piss off dedicated fans by punishing a team for playing  mins of equal hockey you havent accounted for why ties were eliminated in the first place CASUAL FANS. The NHL like every other sports league in North America is on a never ending quest to entice more casual fans and potential new fans to the game. Casual fans in North America fucking HATE ties. It is extremely offputting to NA sports fans. Add to this that not enough regular NHL watchers even really want ties back the no ties rule will never change and really shouldnt.. The lottery can only screw over the worst teams so much. If youre one of the worst teams youll have a top  pick no matter what. What youre proposing would have my Bruins the last team out in the last two drafts with both Connor McDavid and Auston Matthews. Now dont get me wrong I love the idea of having both but adding those highimpact franchise rookies to a Boston team that already has its ASG quality core is not fair nor is it in the best interest of the league. If you want a fair implementation change ONLY THE BOTTOM s draft chances to prioritize the winningest teams among themselves. Even then it is a flawed system but it wouldnt fault a Columbus for their last two lateseason surges. . I love the modern format. Yes early round playoff matches are somewhat repetitive but how do you think the NHLs best rivalries began in the first place? FAMILIARITY BREEDS CONTEMPT. New true rivalries the kind that span player and fan generations wont pop up because of one kind of heavy playoff series. They come from years of playing the same hated opponent. Boston and Montreal isnt a natural rivalry. Many MTL fans cheer for Boston teams in other sports especially the Patriots. Our deep heated rivalry comes from how many times weve met each other in heated playoff series. I really want the NHL to return to the old scheduling format as well. More divisional games for the same reason.,KontinentalHL,dc1hi79,3,t5_2uy1o
