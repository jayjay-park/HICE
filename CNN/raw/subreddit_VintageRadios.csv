5270974,0,t1_cvlest8,Oh definitely!  Ive always loved those transoceanics when Ive seen them in antique stores.  Saw one on craigslist not far from my house but I wasnt really in the market for one at the time.  But I emailed him telling him that if he didnt get any better offers he was moving needed to get rid of stuff Id offer him .  He told me if I could make it  its mine.  Bought it that day though I did need new hinges for the front flap.  Some guy in Australia had a pair that he sold me for another .That second link I gave you also has some good intro to restoration information as well.  Im still new to this specifically but have a little background in basic electronics.  Happy to help you out as best I can if you need it!  These are really neat radios  shortwave can be picked up pretty much worldwide.  Theres a good reason this model is called transoceanic.  Unfortunately shortwave isnt as popular as it used to be and died an early death but there are still stations out there!  Take a look at the wiki page on shortwave listening as well.,VintageRadios,cvlfcst,2,t5_37t5b
6072539,0,t3_3ypg1t,With more specific model information you should be able to find the schematic here The most likely thing to happen is a capacitor blowing out. There are two types of capacitors that fail in the older radios waxpaper and electrolytic.The waxpaper are filled with wax that oozes out over time causing them to fail. These are mostly used in the radio frequency portions of the circuit. They tend to be about the size of a tootsie roll have bare metal wires on each end and have yellowish wax sticking out of the edges.The electrolytic caps have a paste in them that dries out causing them to fail. They tend to be used to filter noise Hz AC line hum from the wall power. They are much larger like the size of a roll of quarters or more and usually have colored wires coming from their ends.. Dont apply power again. Failed caps have been known to explode andor catch fire. Usually the first thing you do before applying power to these is inspect them. I suspect I dont have to tell you this at this point since you quickly pulled power but I figured it couldnt hurt to underscore the point.. Youre going to want to replace all of the waxpaper and electrolytic caps. Some people pull each one and test it but thats often just putting off the inevitable with the other caps. edit Forgot to mention you can get the values from reading them off the capacitor sometimes or from the schematic.. The worst case scenario is that a capacitor failure rippled through other components and took out the transformer andor other tubes in which case those will also need to be replaced or possibly repaired in the case of the transformer but thats not something you typically want to take on unless its absolutely necessary  like a valuable radio and no replacements available.You can find the capacitors by removing the chassis the silver case that the tubes mount in. Theyre mounted to the underside.As to value no idea. If you like it and want to restore it I say go for it. It might be best to ask on the forums at  to make sure you dont have something rare in which case you might consider having it professionally restored or selling it to one of the members on the forum. If you do decide to take it on yourself that forum is a wealth of information and aside from a few curmudgeons can be very helpful toward your efforts.Good luck!,VintageRadios,cyflia7,3,t5_37t5b
6248014,0,t1_cyzl8b7,Alright thanks Ill do that and see what happens. Ill try to update this thread in a couple minutes. Thank you for your help. ,VintageRadios,cyztycd,1,t5_37t5b
7072756,0,t3_4cgskl,More info  Quad hifi is money   prices are in Euro and site is in Dutch but you will understand the info,VintageRadios,d1i26az,2,t5_37t5b
7525161,0,t1_d2wscx1,Tubes? heres the inside from my observation there is  tubes. Any idea on a value or what I should do to preserve its condition. ,VintageRadios,d2xknm9,1,t5_37t5b
8213150,0,t3_4rukju,It sounds muddled and I think the preamp tube is making a lot of noise. Im kind of new to vintage electronics but Im not new to electronics. Ive been doing computer motherboard repairs and basic electronics troubleshooting for years. Heres an album,VintageRadios,d54759m,1,t5_37t5b
11463096,0,t3_63mtyd,I picked this up at a flea market. The seller said the power cable was missing so he was not sure it was working. Well its not missing its cut or broken. You can see a little stub sticking out next to the other BampW wires. Those go to the turntable. If I open that metal box and find just a little more wire I can splice in a new cord and see what happens. Or am I just going to start a fire and should really think about repurposing the whole thing?more photos,VintageRadios,dfvc2c6,2,t5_37t5b
