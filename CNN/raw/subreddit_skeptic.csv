30514,0,t3_1ug6tu,Chemtrails dont make sense on many levels    . At the altitude many of these plains fly the aerosolized particles actually would remain suspended in the atmosphere for years before falling to the ground.  And what does would be in such small quantities that it would be unlikely to have an effect on people.  Ever wonder why crop dusters fly so low to the ground?. The weight of getting enough liquid into flight makes this not only insanely expensive but not possible for commercial airliners to carry.  If only military aircraft did it there would not be enough chemical to have an impact on people on the ground.  . Not only would they need tones more of the chemical at that altitude but it would cover everything on the ground.  If they are doing this why is this chemical not reported by anyone doing studies on pesticides or checking what is on farms crops for health and safety inspections?      What actually happening is as follows    The change in pressure that happens when an object is flying through the air at great speeds causes water vapor suspended in air to condense leaving a temporary cloud.  This is why you can see them on the leading edge of the planes wing out the back end of the engines and anything that breaks the wings smooth airfoil like stabilizers lights and the tip of the wing.    Basic level physics tells us that vapor trails are not unexpected and a small knowledge of the atmosphere tells us that they will not always be consistent.  Then thinking through the practicality of spraying chemicals out of planes tells us that they are almost certainly not.  And even if the government wanted to spray people with some chemical there would be many more efficient ways to do it.,skeptic,cehwmjs,4,t5_2qj8f

239615,0,t3_1wsgnh,I think you need to disconnect the reasonable assertions you made in the first two paragraphs that the news media are its a plural noun and thinking of the media as a multitude and not a single entity helps driven by ratings more often than journalism and that the powerful operate in their own selfinterest from conspiracy theories. The conspiracy theories often use a begging the question technique wherein they posit those sort of reasonable observations as without actually proving such a connection of incontrovertible proof that their wacky theories are correct. Part of being a good skeptic is to analyze each claim independently that association doesnt automatically prove or disprove something.Second remember the underlying psychology of why people believe in conspiracy theories. They provide two things creating order and a clear narrative to a world lacking in such things and gives a sensation of power to the believer that they understand the truth unlike all those sheeple out there. Right now youre getting a lot of conspiracy theories among the Fox News crowd because the sociopolitical changes to America are frightening them. The demos that used to dominate American politics religious conservatives rural andor southern whites military hawks are now finding themselves more and more marginalized with new demos rising in importance and that feels threatening. So conspiracy theories allow them to feel power to feel assured and to assert that those with the new power arent legitimate.

At once point in time every diamon in every jewelry store in the western world passed though DeBeers hands.   DeBeers is also responsible for the entire idea of an engagement ring having a diamond thanks to constant advertising to generate demand.  They buy tons and tons of diamonds to restrict supply and keep the prices high and it was how they got caught up in the blood diamond thing when the African rebels captured diamond minds and flooded the market with them.   DeBeers bought a ton of them to keep the rebels from driving down the princes and funded genocide in Africa.  Though Lately I think some Isrealis and a Russian are cutting into the DeBeers cartel.

397069,0,t1_cfl73u7,Heres a very recent review  that gives a decent overview of gene targeting in plants.  Contrary to my assumption it turns out that targeted gene insertion is much more difficult in plants than in animals or yeast and random integration is favored in most cases.  Although the first report of gene targeting in plants dates to  it was not until the last decade that efficiencies improved to the point of being feasible.  The breakthrough seems to have been the development of programmable nucleases a very interesting field in and of itself that recognize specific and unique nucleotide sequences in the genome.  Since targeted gene insertion relies by homologous recombination which in turn relies on the cells DNA repair machinery introducing a double strand break at the chosen site of insertion with your programmed nuclease will recruit said machinery to that site and thereby favor a replacement event.  So yes all GMOs to date have been generated via random insertion of the transgene but we should see that change in the near future as targeted insertion is obviously preferable and now feasible.Thanks for inspiring me to do some reading on this  very interesting!,skeptic,cflx7fg,1,t5_2qj8f

As opposed to a defensive stance to simply collect information on an asneeded basis and with a court ordered warrant.Look at the tactics described in the slides which I know are GCHQ but the classification level does say REL to USA  meaning release to USA and compare it to the NSAs mission statement.  Compare it to the th Amendment.You dont have to follow Greenwalds train of thought and agree with it.  Just look at the raw evidence the slides and draw your own conclusions.  Whether they are doing this plan to do this or have tried and failed to do this  its clearly something that should be cause for concern.  Its clearly something that warrants further investigation of the NSA and GCHQ because theyve been too secret for too long and its resulted in too much power consolidated in the hands of too few people.

But it simply wont ring true very much because his intentions are clearly to help other foreign governments and people. He doesnt consider himself a US citizen. Snowden considers himself as helpful to other nations. He wanted asylum from Germany thats why he helped Germany. He traveled to China to escape US law he wanted their help and asylum.

Add to that depending on what equipment they have it can take a few seconds from when the button is hit for it to cut to the promo I can easily see this as a mistake. Ive done it plenty of times myself. Add to that the fact that when it does happen they dont like you to cut back to the show mid promo so you have to sit there watching your fuck up be broadcast to the whole area. I hated that job.

In the latter case the issues of the credibility of the person making the statement may be crucial.I was referring to the credibility of the person presenting that data  sensationalist once maybe sensationalist again. That is we accept evidence or interpretations of that evidence according to the weight we place on the credibility of the source. It is the moral of the story behind The Boy Who Cried Wolf story  we do not trust liars else we will not believe them later.

784100,0,t1_cgte1vn,Well there are obvious clear differences between the nuero structures of the human and other animals particularly in the frontal cortex. This is why i dont believe they have a conciousness. Because their frontal cortex does not exist they dont have a sense of self. This sense of self is the root of suffering in humans its why we all suffer. Also i would assert that animals cant remember events. They can register words sounds smells and tastes and can become conditioned to respond to them. This is why dogs can be trained and as such will shrink away from pain or stimulus that reminds them of pain. However since they dont really have a very good concept of time i dont think there is a way they could remember suffering. Horses dont remember when they were spurred they just know how to react. Ok so now to the concept of free will. This is a little bit harder to define. I would say that animals lack the ability to express their wishes and therefore lack free will. This is why bestiality is illegal. In order to have will one must be able to express it. Now you could say some high primates and dolphins or elephants can express themselves thru sign which i would accept. I woundnt consider it ethical to test on them but also not negatively unethical because they still lack the capacity as a whole to acknowledge their suffering or suffering of others. Free will is important in this debate because it is a defining factor. It decides legality in our society. This is why i dont think animals can suffer because they lack free will.  Now for my final topic human suffering. As a happy agnostic buddhist i would point out that all humans suffer. It is in our natural state to suffer because we persist with the idea that we exist.

We also plant things in a mixed manner preferring not to put the same plant next to one another. Both of these things a tendency to help slow the spread of pests since pests have a harder time moving from preferred plant to preferred plant.These practices could potentially increase yields without the usage of broad pesticides or herbicides which could mean a better future for bees Imidacloprid even in tiny amounts appears to be a contributing factor in colony collapse disorder and other polinators and a more varied habitat for creatures to live in. Weve sort of wiped out entire ecosystems by farming so much of the land. OregonWashingtons Oak Savannahs are almost entirely gone as a quick example. Replacing that with something where other animals can coexist is better for the environment by definition.These practices are hard to scale up which is where your demand argument comes in. However planting in monoculture has costs  Increased pests lots of bare soil to protect from undesired plants. Use of roundupreadystyle gmo lowers these costs resulting in an even more entrenched monoculture.Whew!gtNo one has gone to trial for accidental blow over.Is that true? I dont know. The case that immediately springs to mind is this one In this case Schmeiser tells a pretty plausible story concerning noticing an immune patch of Canola spraying it with roundup then harvesting the seeds. This is more or less exactly how a natural mutation to roundup would occur so he at least had plausible deniability for how roundup resistant canola came to be in his field. Its also exactly how accidental blow over would appear or even cross polinization If such is possibleprobably with that particular strain of canolaNow the judge disagreed that this story was plausible but I cant find any evidence why.

1438328,0,t1_ciweaba,Cool I want to discuss some of the things youve said on Wikipedia and here now so I just wanted to confirm you were the relevant Wikipedia editor.Regarding the discussionI noticed as soon as somebody doesnt agree with you and support your edits you accuse them of censorship bias and even worse being fans of Jenny McCarthy. Whats remarkable about this is with two minutes of research you can see that EvergreenFir who you specifically accused of bias has repeatedly reverted edits that attempted to remove the fact that shes an antivaccine activist from the lead section. Focus on the arguments rather than the accusations as even if the accusations are true they add nothing constructive to the conversation.Regarding your editsTheres two issues that Ive seen why youre generally opposed and I agree with them but before I get into those points let me first state that I agree with the following Jenny McCarthy is an antivaxxer and a prominent member of that community Vaccinations reduce illnesses and death. A lack of vaccinations leads to preventable illnesses and deaths.I figured Id get that out of the way as you seem to be under the impression that if somebody agrees with those points then they must agree that your edit should be included in the article. So on to the two main points that I see. Assuming that interpretation of the statistics is from a reliable source those stats are about the antivaccine movement and are not specific to Jenny McCarthy. For Jenny McCarthys page its more appropriate to discuss her involvement with the movement then to start discussing stuff to do with the movement that does not relate directly to her.. In this instance the HuffPo Blog doesnt seem to be a reliable source for the interpretation of the statistics anyway. Its a blog post written by somebody with a background in marketing using a website made by somebody in the entertainment industry as a source of the interpretation. Neither of which seem to have any training in interpreting statistics relating to public health. You call the stats ...the CDC calculations of the impact of antivaccine behaviours. and theyre not. They are the raw data of all the deaths and illnesses relating to vaccinepreventable diseases some of those illnesses occur in people who are vaccinated dont forget especially when it comes to Whooping Cough.

1445739,0,t1_ciwv1rv,gt Thats not skepticism. Thats just wholesale denial.I beg to differ. Wholesale denial implies that I refuse to believe that anybody has the expertise to solve the problem. Skepticism implies that I simply do not have sufficient evidence to believe this. I have good reason to have little confidence in the prediction of economists and politicians overall when dealing with shifting national consumption patterns on a commodity be it energy overall carbonbased energy sources etc. on top of my scientists inclination to take the null position by default.gt Welcome to America where everyone feels entitled to an opinion. Your opinion is worthless of course and more important wrong.On economists being random number generators when I say that this is in my opinion I do not mean that I simply pull this opinion out of my ass. Economists are notoriously inaccurate as a whole and this is a trend that has been appreciated by economists themselves. Of course the lay public tends to have higher confidence in economists because of survivorship bias the talking heads we see on national television are generally those talking retrospectively about the latest economic trend and of course these economists would not be invited on the Talking Heads Show had they not been correct. As far as largescale economic events are concerned most notably the recent economic downturn beginning in  economists failed to predict the events on average. There are data to back up this position as well see Models of Inflation Expectations Formation A Comparison of Household and Economist Forecasts by EM Gramlich and the subsequent literature discussion for an example. Also see the prediction confidence intervals in this report for a visual display of how widely some predictions vary. The end manifestation of this inaccuracy is what youd expect if nobody was consistently correct there is no consensus when it comes to complex predictions in the world of economics. Not so with science where predictions that are consistently correct lead to consensus e.g. climate changegt Actually there is a great deal of published research on what to do about climate change. Your ignorance notwithstanding.Oh I do not deny that there is a great body of literature published on the subject. The publication can be broadly dichotomized into hard science recommendations by experts in climatology and related fields that suggest what endoutcomes must be implemented to correct climate change trends and soft science recommendations economics and political science etc. on how these recommendations couldshould be achieved. The latter category is the one in which I have very little confidence for reasons stated above. gt But you dont actually know do you. Yes mostly I do. Its kind of in the definition. What should be done is outside of the realm of climate science. Its in the realm of politics economics and cultural philosophy. If a scientist is giving an opinion regarding this its as a layperson albeit an educated one. Of course maybe there is a peervetted established degreeholding climate scientist out there who is also a peervetted established degreeholding economist. I dont know of any but its possible and I would change my statement accordingly should I become more enlightened on the matter.gt This is another one of your opinions unencumbered by facts isnt it. No. See above.gt Typically such studies are done by teams of researchers. Everyone contributes from their area of expertise. Correct. See above as to why I do not think that economists have the predictive power to have a consensus statement on par of a scientific one and that scientists giving economic addenda to their scientific consensus statements are doing so outside of their expertise.gt Scientists dont really publish lone research studies any more.Lone as in single author are rare. But youre implying large authorships with many disciplines contributing. Ill take lone to mean a few authors with one shared area of expertise.I am a scientist and I have recently published lone studies. So... I disagree with your statement. I am not a climate scientist though so I decided to check your claim in the field of climate science. You are incorrect there as well. Examples found in about  seconds of searching   a single author  gt I am ignorant therefore everyone is ignorant. Well goody for you.a straw man. I never said such a thing nor did I imply it. I am no economist and I not once said that just because I cannot come up with a provably viable solution that nobody else can. As I just explained my reasoning is that no consensus has been reached solutions to the problem are often mutually exclusive and there is little historic precedent establishing that any of the wildly variable solutions are likely to be successful. b I was pretty amiable in my response and your retort was in short pretty juvenile. Skepticism is supposed to be an intellectual pursuit. Dont be such an ass.

You have emotion only.Having dealt with so many AGW believers Ive put together a list of the common AGW arguments in their comon order of presentation. For each I provide reasons why the argument is hogwashItem  .  of scientists agree  Irrelevant. A mass of people being wrong doesnt make them right by consensus. This is the perhaps the most widely known figure thrown about as supposed proof. The online survey was conducted in  and contained nine questions. The  percent figure was based upon the answers to two of those questions.  individuals were invited to participate in the survey. These individuals represented a broad range of Earth scientists. Of the  people who actually completed the survey just  of them  by the standards of the survey  were published experts in the field of climate science.The first of the two questions focused on was When compared with pres levels do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen fallen or remained relatively constant? Of course most answered yes. The second question honed in on to produce the  percent consensus was Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures? No mention made of CO. Of the few survey participants who could actually claim to be climate scientists  of  answered risen to the first question and  out of  answered yes to the second. Thats the  figure. Item  . Most published papers support AGW.  Irrelevant. It doesnt matter how many papers are published if they all constitute fiction. Not one of the predictions of those AGW papers have come to pass.Item  . Its been warming for the entire industrial period.  Yes it has. Prior to that the world was cold and prior to the cold it was warm. Warming is natural. There is some evidence that cold periods are spurred by catastrophic volcanic eruptions. If that is the case for all of the cold periods than we can conclude that a warm world is the natural state. If catastrophe is not the cause then we can reasonable conclude that warmcold cycles are entirely natural. In either case it makes more sense to research the reasons behind the cold that kills rather than the warmth that brings all manners of good things.Item  . Its the speed of the present warming thats different from past warmings.  No evidence whatsoever. Its not possible to collect data at a resolution fine enough to make any such claim.Item   Severe weather is increasing. Its not. All disruptive events are down in number. Tornados hurricanes and droughts have been declining. All of those were more prevalent during the cool period prior to  and all of those rise and fall in lockstep with ENSO cycles.Item   Temperatures continue to rise. They arent doing so right now. Counter to AGW prediction weve been holding steady since . If the  ENSO high is removed then global temperatures have been steady for longer than that. CO levels have risen since  without a concommitant rise in temperature. AGW theory cant account for that and it runs counter to prediction.Item   Starting to count years at  is cherrypicking. Ridiculous. We begin counting at the number . If temperatures have been flat since  then we begin counting from .  Item   The missing heat is going into the oceans below  meters. At what point did that begin? The same process would have to have been in operation for the entire industrial period. The proposal is ridiculous. There is no data to back up that contention. The ARGO program has so far determined that there has been no increase in temperatures at depth. Besides that fact there is no mechanism that could transfer heat from the surface to that depth. Let me know which of these youd like to try to defend.gt I worked in this field for  years and at least I had to be convinced of what was happening.If thats the case then youve failed utterly to keep up with what the data and cross discipline analysis is telling you. You also depend on AGW for a paychegue. Nothing blinds people to facts like self interest. Self interest is what packs the AGW crowd shoulder to shoulder.

Of course no one individuals rights in this case bodily autonomy are allowed to impede on those of another individual particularly the right of not being harmed by another person. Not vaccinating doesnt carry nearly as large of a risk its still clearly not a good thing though. From your wiki link under Policies and history by country United States emphasis minegtStates in the U.S. mandate immunization or obtaining exemption before children enroll in public school. Exemptions are typically for people who have compromised immune systems allergies to the components used in vaccinations or strongly held objections. All states but West Virginia and Mississippi allow religious exemptions and twenty states allow parents to cite personal or philosophical objection.Unfortunately such mandates dont cover home school or private schools although Im willing to bet that most private schools do require uptodate immunization records along with allowing the same exemptions. The government can mandate whatever requirements it wants to use its resources but it cannot impose on an individual who does not use those resources. And this same sectiongtThe American Academy of Pediatrics AAP notes the dilemma faced by many parents in that vaccines are a very safe and important health intervention but are neither riskfree nor  effective. It advises physicians to respect the refusal of parents to vaccinate their child after adequate discussion unless the child is put at significant risk of harm e.g. during an epidemic or after a deep and contaminated puncture wound under such circumstances the AAP states that parental refusal of immunization constitutes a form of medical neglect and should be reported to state child protective services agencies.Which is what Ive been saying when talking about direct causality i.e. not vaccinating isnt enough on its own to merit declaring parents as unfit unless there is an observable causal risk as well as earlier when I mentioned that parents need to be held responsible but only in extreme circumstances. And legislation that restricts bodily autonomy is completely relevant to the issue of whether or not doctors or the government can force coerce or otherwise impel any individual to receive or continue a medical treatment even vaccines and vitamin shots against that individuals wishes. People especially Americans do not take restrictions of their rights lightly. In the process of all these exchanges in which Ive been engaged on this thread I have brainstormed a sort of stop gap measure. If we cant change the parents minds then we work on changing the kids minds starting at a very young age via education about vaccines. Then once their old enough to retain full bodily autonomy we offer to catch them up on their vaccinations if they wish. Some will still refuse but I believe that with the right presentation we could at least welcome a good proportion of them into the vaccinated herd. Edit my phones dying and I need to get some sleep.

I have never been able to describe my emotional reactions when I first came face to face with indisputable evidence of Nazi brutality and ruthless disregard of every shred of decency. Up to that time I had known about it only generally or through secondary sources. I am certain however that I have never at any time experienced an equal sense of shock.I visited every nook and cranny of the camp because I felt it my duty to be in a position from then on to testify at first hand about these things in case there ever grew up at home the belief or assumption that the stories of Nazi brutality were just propaganda. Some members of the visiting party were unable to go through with the ordeal. I not only did so but as soon as I returned to Pattons headquarters that evening I sent communications to both Washington and London urging the two governments to send instantly to Germany a random group of newspaper editors and representative groups from the national legislatures. I felt that the evidence should be immediately placed before the American and the British publics in a fashion that would leave no room for cynical doubt.GEN Dwight Eisenhower Crusade in Europe pp.  Doubleday New York gtHeinrich Himmler instructed his camp commandants to destroy records crematoria and other signs of mass extermination.Operation Reinhard Extermintation Camps of Belzec Sobibor and Treblinka Yitzhak AradgtI also want to refer here very frankly to a very difficult matter.

Leuchter compiled the report in  with the intention of investigating the feasibility of mass homicidal gassings at Nazi extermination camps specifically at Auschwitz. He travelled to the camp collected multiple pieces of brick from the remains of the crematoria and gas chambers without the camps permission brought them back to the United States and submitted them for chemical analysis. At the trial Leuchter was required to defend the report in his capacity as expert witness however he was dismissed because during the proceedings it became apparent that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act in such a position.There is much much more millions of pages of scholarship on the holocaust and nothing but tinfoil and racist crackpots producing the holocaust denials.

1650036,0,t1_cjn3x6i,A consensus or appeal to scientific expertise can be useful when the subject in question is extraordinarily complex and necessitates synthesizing lots of data often from several different disciplines. This is the case with climate change. I will give an example. I have a PhD and I conduct clinical trials for a career. I have the competence to evaluate individual studies outside of my research domain. For example I would be confident in my ability to read an individual study in most any research area and give a competent critical review. Most anyone with a decent baseline level of education in science can do this. However I would not have the competence to synthesize the fund of research from an area outside of my expertise and speak to complex theories that draw on numerous studies and different fields. Only a person with an evidenced history of expertise including education and publishing in that area is equipped to do that. The problem with attempting to do that when you dont have the expertise is that your framework for drawing inferences about the data is completely baseless. The research methodology statistical methods decisions regarding meaningful effect sizes and inferences regarding the significance of a particular study to the field as a whole absolutely necessitate a familiarity of the current research in the field or fields that has been developed over decades. Only experts have this knowledge. Finally this appeal to authority doesnt occur in isolation. These experts have published numerous systematic reviews and metaanalyses that support this position. This data just indicates that ya most of the experts in the field agree with these publishes reviews and analyses.  ,skeptic,cjn5fgh,24,t5_2qj8f

1764283,0,t1_ck18gkw,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said.In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan.I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories.Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it.I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care.The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome.That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there.

Otherwise youre either a hypocrite or falling for bullshit scare tactics with no relationship to how things actually work. In which case no reasoned argument will work until you actually take the time to learn how science works and learn some basic biology.And if youre skeptical about products on an individual basis GMOs generally hold up a lot better because theyre actually tested for safety unlike products produced by selective breeding which have no actual safety testing whatsoever before reaching market.gt  But a farmer that has grown plants and bred animals all of his life being told that GMOs are better?

If you want to talk about IP law for seeds we can talk about that. It clearly applies across the agricultural industry. The fact that evil Monsanto gets targeted by antiGMO activists and reporters doesnt mean that IP law is a GMO issue.

Yet Roundup is specifically tailored to use with Roundup Ready seeds. Heirloom seeds cant be sprayed with these products.Yep. So? Roundup is a pretty safe herbicide with an MD of over  mgkg Youd pretty much have to drink the stuff for it to be harmful.

Ignore the blog focus on the studies. Now we cant talk about all of those studies at once so how about we discuss this report by a European commission that examined a decade of EUfunded GMO research and says on page  The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than  research projects covering a period of more than  years of research and involving more than  independent research groups is that biotechnology and in particular GMOs are not per se more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies? If you never see these brought up in discussions on GMO safety then youre not having the right discussions.The narrative is being influenced by antiGMO pundits who have financial interest in giving bad publicity to GMOs. People like Gillesric Sralini who released a horribly flawed study purporting to show that GMOs caused cancer. However he didnt allow any other scientists to review his study and he timed the release of his study with an antiGMO book and movie he made. And you shouldnt take my word for it. Look it up!

Im pretty sure that at least one says they maintained moderate protein but Ill double check later and confirm. Note that protein is not normally calculated as a percentage of total caloric intake but rather as a specific target based on lean muscle mass. Low carbketogenic dieters are usually advised to only eat as much protein as needed to maintain muscle mass as this prevents gluconeogenesis from knocking people out of ketosis.It seems premature to state that all lowcarb diets which confer a weight loss benefit are also high protein...

2323196,0,t3_2lw2bp,Chronic Lyme is a really personal issue for me. Whats responsible for most of my animosity toward alternative medicine is a result of my siblings experience. A lot of silly beliefs I can just laugh at  alt med is a deeply personal battle. My sibling around  years ago came down with some sort of problem. Major fatigue poor functioning pain severe headaches a laundry list of symptoms that seriously interfered with his life. Was unable to continue school. My parents took him to various doctors but nobody could provide a diagnosis  something was clearly wrong and nobody could figure out what it was. Unfortunately some of the doctors lacked proper bedside manner and even had my parents walking off under the impression that psychosomatic was the same as not real something that could have easily been cleared up by better doctors. Eventually after enough poking around on the internet they find out about Chronic Lyme Disease. The story fit perfectly   a long list of nonspecific symptoms that nobody could apply to a specific condition. But theres a catch! Traditional tests such as those recommended by mainstream medicine arent effective at diagnosing so its important to go to a Lyme Literate Doctor aka quack willing to diagnosis fake diseases and prescribe actual drugs to treat the fake disease. So my parents and my sibling end up with this diagnosis and the hope and ray of light that you now know whats wrong overwhelms skeptical thinking  Im sure any of us could understand. So treatment begins. I dont know the particulars of what they were doing just what happened in more recent years but there was no improvement sometime over the  years looking for diagnosis it had turned into more of a fatigue that comes and goes. Insurance wouldnt cover stuff. Lots of blood testing and lab work most of it likely unnecessary and useless and legitimately ugly side effects due to whatever they were doing. They were recommended to new professionals and new treatments by other members of the community. The list kept growing and growing WITH NO MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENT. Tons of money tons of time sibling doing some barelycounts homeschooling. Dad spends his time preparing homeopathic remedies and administering them. At some point the professionals convince him that he also needs a whole bunch of supplements for stuff like Candida and adrenal fatigue both also fake diseases that Naturopaths love. This went on for YEARS. Eventually they were doing IV antibiotics with serious side effects for this nonexistent condition. They installed an IV port in my brother to make this a simpler process. It got infected a known potential complication and he was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Thank God pulled through with minimal longterm damage. Thats about the time I really realized what was going on  Id kept my distance and tried to stay out of it. My parents have no retirement money anymore. Approximately  million in mostly stock before the market crashed and medical expenses for bullshit forced them to sell at horribly inopportune times. New mortgage on the house. My father spends all his time at quack doctors for himself and my brother putting pills and remedies together and administering them. His entire life has turned into this. My brother has no social circle is incredibly socially awkward from being kept out of school from a young age and has no life skills from being babied this whole time. And heres the really sad part  few years ago I found out I have Bipolar Disorder. Strong genetic component. My brother over these years has continually crashed from symptoms flaring I think thats some Lyme community term during which he talks about suicide and has no energy. At other times hes floating along like normal  nobody can actually tell hes sick. And at other times hes talking really fast and taking on a bunch of new activities for weeks. But of course that  like literally everything  is just Lyme symptoms. I often wonder to myself how much of his problems would vanish with proper treatment for a pretty obvious mood disorder. The Chronic Lyme community is depressing. These people are victims taken in by falsehope and a name for whats wrong with them. The nonspecific symptoms and oh the tests dont work you need a Lyme literate doctor allows literally anyone to be diagnosed. They lose their time. They lose their money. And in many cases they never get to figure out whats actually wrong. And in some cases serious medical complications result from nonindicated drug treatment with no supervision. As far as Im concerned the professionals involved in this charade are the scum of the earth. But hey whats the harm?TLDR Family fucked by Chronic Lyme and alt med but remember to treat people who think they have this as the victims they are rather than mocking them and treating them as idiots.

My position is that if the science is settled and anyone that does not believe in the current beliefs in climate change is a denier then we should have more accurate predictions of what to expect over the next few years. So far noone can explain exactly why we havent seen global warming in the last x years and until we can accurately predict what to expect in the near future its way to early to say we know exactly where we are going. Will it be another ice age? Will it be the rise of the oceans? Will it be catastrophic weather changes? I havent seen any of the FUD that has been handed to the public in the past  years come to pass so if the science is solid enough shouldnt we have better predictions for the near future? Without having accurate predictions of climate patterns over the next few years maybe we shouldnt be so quick to attack people with somewhat differing opinions. So if we are looking at trends over time then scientists putting forward this idea should have a more predictable model for future expectations  correct? At the very least maybe we need more accuracy before we begin politicizing and voting down people with slightly different opinions on the science?

Also humans are not the only hominids chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans are all hominids.Also monkeys are not monophyletic Old World monkeys are more closely related to apes than to New World monkeys monkey is generally defined based on physiological characteristics more than descent so the LCA of apes and monkeys would almost certainly also be a monkey despite having nonmonkey descendants.gt This is fundamentally incorrect.Prior to the th century ape and monkey were synonyms. During the th century the terms separated in order to distinguish between grades of humanlike characteristics.

The language can be very dense yes because like all specialised fields it contains jargon that needs to be understood before text can be interpreted. And its not unscientific its more accurate to say its nonscientific as it doesnt attempt to be scientific which isnt a problem at all as it addresses issues that arent accessible to scientific inquiry.gtCan you decipher this for me? Sure. This is what the original abstract saysgtThis article develops a research position that allows cultural sociologists to compare morality across sociohistorical cases. In order to do so the article suggests focusing analytic attention on actions that fulfill the following criteria a actions that define the actor as a certain kind of socially recognized person both within and across fields b actions that actors experienceor that they expect others to perceiveas defining the actor both intersituationally and to a greater extent than other available definitions of self and c actions to which actors either have themselves or expect others to have a predictable emotional reaction. Such a position avoids both a realist moral sociology and descriptiverelativism and provides sociologists with criteria for comparing moral action in different cases while staying attuned to social and historical specificity.My understanding of itgtThis article attempts to develop a framework for sociologists who study culture to compare morality across societal and historical cases. To do this it focuses on three things  moral actions that define the person performing the action in a socially relevant way  moral actions determine how that actor sees themselves and how others see them and  moral actions that produce predictable emotional reactions across time places and people. This approach allows us to sidestep the problem of questioning whether morals really exist or are out there in some sense and avoid the relativist problem of thinking all morals are equally valid so we shouldnt judge them for it and also provides sociologists with a consistent framework for studying moral actions across time places and people.Doesnt seem so hard to understand. Definitely not an example of postmodernism. ,skeptic,cmjok3b,1,t5_2qj8f

I did find thisgtUrinary tract infections are not without consequence. Ginsburg and McCracken reported blood cultures positive for bacteria in  of infants less than  days of age with urinary tract infection. We found that a similar proportion of boys with urinary tract infection had concomitant bacteremia. Furthermore several of the infants concurrently had meningitis also with the same organisms renal failure and a fatal outcome. There are longerterm sequelae of urinary tract infections. Renal scarring will occur in  to  of infants after urinary tract infetions. Of those with parenchymal scarring hypertension will develop in approximately  and renal insufficiency will develop in  to  Children with urinary tract infection will eventually make up  of all patients with endstage renal disease. Finally as many as  of children may die following a urinary tract infection during the first month of life. In this investigation we found neonatal circumcision to be beneficial in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infection and associated bacteremia. The study was of first month complications.

2561616,0,t1_cmstvqy,EDIT  uFonguhl got fn schooled and ran away like I expected.Ok Ill do this then.heres a few quick examples from the textThe text misrepresents the natural variation of isoflavones between crops as an actual concernThey claim that independent research has been suppressed yet ignore how the shit research they cite is mostly independent.They claim that Seralinis papers are legitimate despite extensive rebuttals from the EFSA and many other respected organizationsThey claim that criticism of Seralinis studies is both a conspiracy theory and invalid ignoring entirely the inconvenient truth of his researchThey claim that corporate funding and bias means nothing in the case of Seralini and other scientists but claim multiple times that corporatefunded studies cannot be trusted no matter what.They claim that any and all criticism of scientific studies is an attack and that its literally impossible for any antiGM paper to be flawed.They misrepresent research by excluding the scientifically sound research in favor of research that has been extensively criticized by the scientific community. In some cases the report misrepresents the outcome of research such as in the section where they discuss gene transfer  they claim that a study showed gene transfer when in fact it concluded that it did not take place.They claim that Pusztais study was fine despite the massive issues with it.They cite a bewildering variety of debunked and criticized studies as evidence while leaving out any scientifically sound research or even attempting to address any claimed deficiencies in the ignored research.They completely ignore statistical variation and insist that any change no matter how small or how far within the normal variation is always importantThey claim that long term studies are necessary without presenting any evidence to support said claim and ignore entirely the multiple long term studies that have been conducted.They misrepresented the Brazilian nuts case entirelyThey use the quite thoroughly debunked Bt blood study as evidenceThey attempt to claim that the Showa Denko incident was caused by GM despite no evidence supporting this claim and substantial evidence showing that tryptophan causes EMS in the first place.They claim that the CDCs results from the StarLink test were invalid based on an EPA report that criticized one aspect of the CDC study but ignores how there is absolutely no evidence that CryC is an allergen and presents no evidence that refutes the CDC studys results.They claim that there is no evidence to support the claim that nobody has ever been made ill by a GM crop yet cite as examples the above two items where in neither one is there even partial proof that GM was or even could be at fault.They claim that the modified version of Bt used in GM crops is a cause for concern that invalidates any safety data on Bt but then cites a study on Bt. So which is it? Is GM Bt the same or not? Either way the study that they cite is hardly solid evidence of anything.They use various debunked studies as proof that Bt is harmful while ignoring thatA There is no plausible biological mechanism for Bt to harm mammalsB There is quite a bit of research showing how Bt isnt harmful.C There are actual human trials on Bt ingestion and inhalation that showed no effect.D Organic farmers have been using the stuff for a very long time without issues.They cite the American Academy of Environmental Medicine as a source  an Academy of woo that among other things fights water fluoridation promotes quackery such as alternative medicine and is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties as a legitimate organization.They once again ignore any study that contradicts their claims of which there are several good ones for this subject while choosing to present flawed studies instead.They claim that since the current system has not found allergenicity in GM foods its deficient despite how no allergenic food has ever passed through.They claim that voluntary safety testing and the system of having the government demand safety tests is bad despite how the only allergenic crop ever created was caught while it was still in development by exactly this system.They cite a study where a known allergen was expressed in corn yet ignore how it almost certainly resulted from factors unrelated to genetic engineering was already a known allergen posed no actual threat to humans and how this variation was not present in other studies examining the allergenicity of GM corn suggesting that it was confined to the MON line or possibly even not a part of the line.Now please go slink back to rConspiracy ,skeptic,cmsxvh2,21,t5_2qj8f

2570362,0,t1_cmu1dxj,Ive seen the The Mowing Devil before and while crop circles might seem like a good fit to us today this image just represents how crops used to be harvested at the time of the wood cutting right up to the invention of the combine harvester.The story is essentially somebody harvested the crops in this farmers rectangular field. The devil is holding a scythe and the oats are piled in lines waiting to be threshed. Thats a long way off of what a crop circle is.The reason why I know of the Mowing Devil is because despite the mistaken or deliberate interpretation of what that wood cut depicts its still the most popular evidence anyone has to show of crop circles prior to the hoaxes in the s.The site you linked to is hardly without bias since its written by an author of books on the subject so its no surprise that he has taken just about any disruption of vegetation and claimed it to be a crop circle. Many of his examples are damage cause by wind.Patterns being formed in fields by the wind have been a part of farming ever since crops were planted. It was one such event happening in Australia that inspired Doug and Dave to create their own artificial one built to look deliberate. Prior to the new agers getting their hands on the concept wind And rain damage was generally understood to be the cause and wasnt the subject of mystery.What we now consider to be called crop circles designed shapes as opposed to natural wind blown formations is a recent phenomena dating to the time claimed by Doug as the time they began making them. Their spread around the world has also coincided with books published first in England by the very fellows Doug amp Dave set out to trick. Since paranormal books began to become popular in the early s and became global so now have crop circles.Edit Removed a paragraph because it was an opinion of the motives of a person I dont know and I realised that isnt fair.

For that matter why would life elsewhere in the universe disprove the existence of a god?Its not a proof. These things dont provedisprove God. Its a piece of evidence that supports a theory that goes along with what a theory would predict. If theres a pretty good theory and theres one piece of evidence that doesnt fit then you have to try and rework the theory to account for it or you have to come up with a new theory.If there is a god who created us specially and created the earth just for us then it is possible or actually likely that the purpose that hesheit had in mind for creating us was specialimportant enough that there was no point or need to create life elsewhere.   This lack of other life in the universe would be a strong indicator to us that life on this planet did not start by accident that something fishy is going on.  Why is there life here and no where else? No it doesnt lead unambiguously to God but if one is thinking along the lines of God there are some strong connections.  Im pretty sure that SETI was set up by people trying to find life in other places to disprove this argument. See theres life on planets A B C. Its dead easy to evolve life  it happens automatically. There is no need for God at all.  Finding life elsewhere in the universe does not DISPROVE God but it is would be used as an argument against the existence of God.

I believe that the hard data actually backs up my position and that skeptics are merely fundamentalists clinging desperately to the belief in materialism. Thats not to say woo doesnt exist and that it doesnt plague the subject in its own way. But to think that these people are any more reliable is act of faith and that doesnt make sense to me. I have this impression that zazen is just a hangout for agnostics and atheists who simply cant come to grips with their own spiritual needs who cant simply embrace it. Zazen blatantly instructs people to disregard any sort of mystical experience and focus on emptiness. Now that may be a particular practice with its own merits but its not supportive of any sort of inquiry. I know this because Ive done meditation practices and Ive had mystical experiences but not with zazen because zazen trains you to block it. It sounds to me that you are looking for community support for a position that is basically nonsensical. If mystical or spiritual experiences simply dont exist then whats stopping you from actually just testing it out for yourself? If you have years of meditation experience as you say surely youre man enough to wade into any experience and judge it for yourself? Why do you need to stick to a practice that precludes this type of experience and avoid TM if none of this is real? Why do you even need to ask skeptics advice?People here talk of woo but thats dismissing things blindly. Have these people ventured into this uncharted territory?

Its also not very unlikely to assume that it has been mostly those opposed to the Illuminati that attempted to put them in a negative light. Although Im not sure about whether the early conspiracy theorists who put the Illuminati on the conspiracy radar were in fact aligned with religion which would make sense as theyd be key suspects to claim Illuminati are evil and are in fact controlled by Satan. However I know that Pat Robertson who also theorizes about the Illuminati NWO crap is in fact a Christian and spouts complete Christian nonsense  see his book Pat Robertson is one of the major contributors to tie crazy religious millennialism with more secular conspiracies in the modern era.The thing you have to understand about conspiracies is that they are layered ontop of even older conpiracies spouted by some older lunatic. Its one big circle jerk of references to each other. Most of the conspiracies are tied together by some common denominators that some other conspiracy lunatic came up with which in the world of conspiracy somehow grants them validity e.g. Government is controlled by CIA who is controlled by Bilderberg Group who in turn is controlled by Illuminati who are infact aliens which we know because of UFOs which we know because of people that are abducted with the purpose to brainwash us and steal our organs see cow mutilations as our proof etc. etc. etc. .

That just doesnt happen.Even big kitchens maybe have  big ovens and they can only fit so much food in them at a time.Source I work in an enormous kitchen that sometimes seats as many as  people for a single meal sometimes  times a day and we do pretty first class food. Its several dozen metric fucktons of hard work and planning and preprep to make good food on that kind of scale.And were lucky because our budget per seatperson is much higher than a school cafeteria and we probably have more staff and more leeway with menu planning and ingredients and a much better kitchen.I cant imagine how fucked up it is to try to feed one kid for like thirty cents. Maybe a dollar. Now do it  times for small highly opinionated people who generally dont like weird food or most vegetables or who have severe allergies  or worse kids already hooked on fast food. And do it in what probably amounts to a really shitty small andor understaffed kitchen.Wait theres more. Now theres a food lobby and a whole contract business of providing school lunches often from the same kitchens that make prison food.Yeah in the US you kind of end up with tater tots peas sugary fruit cups jello pizza whatever.Granted itd probably be healthier and cheaper just to give em apples fruit and simple but healthy snacks in mealsized quantities but murrrica and all that.,skeptic,cos9yir,7,t5_2qj8f

In this case there is a published survey of the historical record concerning earlyonset tumors of variosu types including those found by Seralini for the particular type of rat he used in his control group.Seralini found  male rats during Month Four of his study that had to be euthanized due to tumors of a certain type.

Since this was during Month Four the carcinogenic subject group size doesnt really apply any way as attrition from naturally occurring tumors in that type of rat doesnt really start to apply until the end of the first year but even if it did  rats out of  vs zero rats out of  would be sufficient to trigger more research or at least should have been.This says nothing about whether or not the tumors were caused by the GMO or whatever only that by the rules of the game it should have triggered more research.,skeptic,cp0txv5,-7,t5_2qj8f

Theres some of that I think but its staggering the degree to which he seems to have misunderstood Chomskys points.In particular he continues to treat this as a divide between intentions and consequences while Chomsky made it abundantly clear that he does not draw moral equivalencies on consequences alone and he explained clearly what he sees as morally criminal about the AlShifa bombing specifically Clintons alleged cavalier attitude toward human life.When Harris launched into his ridiculous hypotheticals I rolled my eyes in disbelief. I could see the opportunity to meaningfully engage on this topic draining away in real time.Now sure Chomsky was a bit of a dick and probably could have done a lot more to foster a conversation himself but since Harris was the one interested in having one I think the responsibility lies mainly with him.The whole thing has soured me a bit on both of them but especially Harris for whom Ive had a great deal of respect in the past.,skeptic,cragil8,3,t5_2qj8f

4257168,0,t1_cs5a66o,The problem with trans genics is that the characteristics of the genes transplanted can cross species on their own. Its generally the same way that antibiotic overuse in industrial agriculturemedicine and overprescription by doctors for personal use was a main factor in the development of MDROs.  In the case of medical practice overuse the resistant organisms lived and reproduced while the other non resistant ones died off.  In the case of agribusiness there was the darwinian element as well but many pathogenic organisms downstream were able to assimilate antibiotic resistance from their own food sources into their own DNA code.  Just like many strains of SA become MRSA and E became VRE through assimilating their foods resistance to antibiotics there are pests that have assimilated some of expressions of those trans genic genes from the plants.   To use the example of BT resistant corn some worms that feed on the corn had a natural resistance to BT while some built up an immunity.  The ones that built up the immunity were able to selfdevelop their own BT resistance using the same genetic material that the BTR Corn used.  There are weeds that have developed the same type of BTR as the corn as well via what is basically a secondary sharing of that particular gene. Ive said before that Im for labeling. The more information I have as a consumer the better.  Im educated and I want to know.  Im not against GMOs as a whole but I am skeptical and wary of certain methods such as transgenics.  My issue has always been that the long term ramifications of transgenics have not adequately been measured.  There was no longitudinal study done on BTR corn.  Had there been a long term study before it hit the market the bleeding of the BTR gene into other organisms might have been documented and accounted for.  ,skeptic,cs5i15p,-6,t5_2qj8f

The industry standards were found to be inadequate. What was different about the building  fire is that it was completely unfought both because there was insufficient manpower and because the water mains had been broken. The firefighters on scene observed the building bulging and shifting and they concluded in advance the building was unsafe. Your entire argument like I wrote at the top of the thread is an argument from personal incredulity. You dont actually have any evidence that anything other than fire brought it down and meanwhile you have basically the entire engineering architecture and firefighting professional communities telling you youre wrong.And in response to this all you can do is spin paranoid fantasies out of whole cloth about hundreds of thousands of people compromising their intellectual and professional integrity out of some supposed fear of some imaginary retribution. Against all your symmetrical collapse and no way no way insistence I put to you these points which not one single Truther has ever even attempted to explain The collapses of the buildings were not accompanied by any audio evidence of blasting on any audio or video recording of the collapses. There are of course dozens of witness accounts of explosions but none of them are verifiable they happen at bizarre time intervals and none of them are consistent with demolition. Not one witness in any of the buildings prior to the attack reported seeing any unusual equipment or installed material of any kind. Due to the buildings construction at least some of the destructive devices would have needed to be emplaced in inhabited areas of the buildings. Not one scrap of any destructive device of any kind was reported found in any of the rubble let alone available for inspection. No det cord wiring nothing. We have exactly as much physical evidence as we would have if the destructive devices evaporated into nothing or if they never existed at all. To believe that the attack was a conspiracy requires one to believe in the perpetrators limitless ability to plan execute conceal and keep secret every possible scrap of information that would prove they exist and yet they decided it would be a workable plan to demolish a building seven hours after the fact and not crash a plane into it. And also apparently inform the BBC ahead of time and have one of the conspirators blithely admit to it while being filmed. Im not capable of that level of doublethink.  No physical evidence of molten iron as thermite would produce and people working the side allegedly saw has ever been presented. no building taller than  stories has ever been demolished with explosive demolition and never has a tubestructure skyscraper. So to the best of our knowledge the practical knowledge and experience to execute such an operation does not exist. The demolition of WTC alone let alone WTC  and  would constitute a monumental engineering feat requiring months if not years of innovation design and planningand yet was apparently planned implemented installed and executed with zero leaks zero witnesses zero disruption to the daily operations of some of the busiest skyscrapers in the world.Against all those criticisms that the Truthers have never explained or provided evidence to refute all your other arguments crumble because theyre nothing but your individual disbelief stated as though it were any kind of fact.,skeptic,csdrzl0,2,t5_2qj8f

4363486,0,t1_cshf7h8,Im not so sure I agree with your interpretation.  The author didnt make any reference to the Pope being an absolute moral authority on theological matters nor did he claim at least according to the way I read the piece that these leaders have an obligation to follow what he says.  The author made reference to the fact that suddenly politicians have actively decried the Popes message in recent weeks and then he finished up by reiterating that the theological argument is in fact more relevant to politicians who are avoiding the scientific argument because theyre not scientists and who believe the Popes duty to be purely theological.  By framing the issue as one of justice for the downtrodden the Pope has turned the argument on its head.  Hes simply pointed out that science says the downtrodden will be heavily burdened by inaction and allowing them to be burdened unnecessarily is immoral and thus theological in nature.  This paragraph hits home for megt For years the right has wrapped its political agenda including climate denial in the shroud of morality and religion. Inhofe has stated Only God can change the climate. The pope has now turned that strategy on its head. God is now on the side of science and the pope is now the MVP of climate change.Theres no implication that the politicians have a duty to listen to what he says.  The suggestion is that an issue Republicans have consistently made to be one with no religious or moral undertones in fact has very overt and unavoidable moral undertones if one looks at it responsibly.  And by pointing out that even the Pope agrees the author is lending credence to that argument.  I dont think these same people publicizing this story would use the same angle to leverage birth control restrictions simply because no one has ever denied that there are dramatic religious and moral undertones to the birth control dialogue so the Pope taking a stance isnt particularly noteworthy.  Im open to your interpretation because I think on a certain level you have a point even though I disagree.  Id like to note however that many Catholics are quick to note that this is not an ex cathedra teaching which means that it comes not with a Papal declaration of infallibility.

4501051,0,t1_csxq27a,gtThe major problem with the application of the law of thermodynamics to the human calorie model is that our bodies are not isolated systems.You can apply the laws of thermodynamics to open and closed systems as well not just isolated ones. Otherwise we couldnt study power plants.And a power plant is a good analogy for the body. Both require fuel that is obtained through a mass transfer into the system. Both release waste heat. Both release waste mass. Power plants might operate at different efficiencies based upon their operating conditions and fuel source nd Law Analysis but they all still never produce more energy than it put into them st Law Analysis. Similarly the body might process different foods differently the difference between a  carb diet and a  carb diet is something small like  kcal and it might simply operate slightly more or less efficiently metabolism differences calorie needs due to muscular composition.A lot of the objections of people who say calories inout doesnt work are based on things that would relate to the nd Law. But those dont mean that the st Law goes away. So the burden of proof is on you to show that these nd Law concerns relating to food type and body functions are  not already accounted for on calorie labels and  significant enough to majorly affect calorie budgeting. Furthermore a lot of those nd Law differences seem to work in the opposite direction. Its more common to have difficultly obtaining energy due to digestive issues than it is to be some sort of hyperefficient human.Another important point is that one of the moststressed points of the article has nothing to do with the heat and mass transfer behind digestion and everything to do with the mental impacts of satiety. Satiety however says nothing about your ability to gain and lose weight no matter what types of food youre eating but only how difficult it is and how much willpower it requires to continue proper calorie consumption while eating mostly foods that dont make you feel very full.Andno matter whatyou still cant then break the law that if you expend more energy in a day than you eat in food your body will break down some of itself to allow that extra energy to be expended.,skeptic,csy0ehg,2,t5_2qj8f

There is a significant minority of researchers who argue against this but even their criticisms seem to amount to accepting that it increases violence and they just argue there is more nuance than typically presented. With things like sexism and misogyny the argument isnt usually that it is caused by video games but rather that video games are another form of media that perpetuates harmful sexist norms  which is obviously undebatable.There is definitely good evidence that being exposed to sexist norms can contribute to sexism in an individual thats just how we learn in the first place. Usually I find the antiscience is on the other side where the people reject the science on video games and aggression or they outright reject entire scientific fields like sociology because they dont like the scientific ideas of things like patriarchy and privilege. gt they think GMOs are evil frankenfood and they think vaccines are poison.

Well you argued that the people earning LESS than k it wasnt just k... were coming from the depths of poverty. So I guess if you actually believe that  of the country is coming from the depths of poverty. I wont argue the point since Im not interested in arguing about weasel words. Ill just mention that the same applies to me. You complained about my examples even though I was not claiming to be quoting the study as you were I just mentioned random round numbers for the sake of example but my argument still stands.gt any significantly appreciable way from the extra k You said less than k. So its not k but k to k.gt And if the k black kids didnt absolutely blow the ltk white kids out of the water  then my points still stand that way as well. So please remind me how much the ultrarich black kids beat the ultrapoor white kids by. It better be by a huge margin. Yeah no. You dont get to make arbitrary demands and arbitrary goalposts and claim victory based on that. In order to answer by how much one group should have beaten the other group we would need to know how their environments  particularly in the type of intellectual stimulation that leads to high SAT scores  compared.P.S. Ill take the fact that you ignored the initial point  that the other user was incorrect in his argument by incorrectly comparing figures in different scales  as you conceding that point.

The magic here is a body process called ketosis in which the body being deprived of easy energy carbohydrates switches to fat as fuel. Calories in calories out still applies. Typically fat loss is accelerated because the body is in a state where it is conditioned to use fat for energy while also in a calorie deficit. My understanding is that the body needs a certain amount of dietary fat to prevent it from turning to its own muscle to supplement. This would simply be another tool in a ketogenic diet to maintain a certain percentage of fat content. Joey Carbs looking to burn a few lbs.

4962663,0,t3_3ivpqa,Well its an article posted on spirit science that was original written over at collective evolution so thats not a great start.  The quote itself is in fact legitimate though coming from his book The Demon Haunted World Science as a Candle in the Dark.  However the quote is taken severely out of context.  From the JREF forumsgtHowever immediately after the quote in question Sagan writes I pick these claims not because I think theyre likely to be valid I dont but as examples of contentions that might be true. They have at least some although still dubious experimental support. Of course I could be wrong. He then goes on to relate how in the mids he found himself unable to sign a manifesto called Objections to Astrology not because he thought astrology has any validity but because I felt and still feel that the tone of the statement was authoritarian. Sagan was not admitting anything about the likely reality of psi phenomena. He was merely being Sagan No claim should be dismissed outofhand or rejected because it seems absurd or stupid or because of the motivations scientific qualifications or moral character of its proponents. Claims should be accepted or rejected only if the evidence warrants it. Sagan was simply defending the view that a good skeptic must be openminded. He is not saying that any of these three claims is true or probably true. He is stating the claims as those who believe them would state them and he is saying they deserve serious study that is they should not be dismissed outofhand. He said the same thing about astrology.Its fairly obvious that he wasnt endorsing reincarnation he was merely saying that there are enough claims out there that it should be examined further.  This is a common theme with Sagan who believed very strongly in letting anything no matter how silly it might sound get looked at in a properly scientific way.Anyway the spirit science article relies entirely on only one source which seems to just be a rehash of the work of Ian Stevenson.  Stevenson was one of the biggest scientific proponents of reincarnation and traveled the world looking for and documenting cases of past life experiences.  However his work is not well regarded in the scientific community at large and has received criticism for being nothing more than a large number of anecdotes suffering from confirmation bias and for not finding anything particularly compelling  Additionally most of the reports come from parts of the world that believe in reincarnation which could indicate that a child growing up in that environment is more likely to invent past life experiences and be encouraged to do so by their family.  The only real physical evidence is birth marks matching the scars of the deceased person but this too has been criticized for cherry picking and in some cases for not actually having proof that the deceased person had those scars to begin with.Basically the supposed new scientific work that this spirit science article talks about is simply a rehash of the old and extremely flawed work that Sagan said needed to be studied more to begin with.,skeptic,cuk2zd9,100,t5_2qj8f

The fact were still discussing this decades later proves the findings are at least interesting and Ive yet to read anything which strongly debunks the central finding of the study  that a substantial number of people will obey a perceived authority figure even when it seems to be hurting another person.

Pointing out problems and even promising to fix them has very little relation to the realistic accountability of said politician. Trump can say all the right things and even act on said promises but the intensity of such changes are much more dependent on the partisan congress and party of origin. Do not forget that Trump is running as a republican he will be sating republican congressmen and republicanleaning lobbyists. This actually has very little to do with his personal views its who will surround him who will advise him and who he wants to appease. The only difference in this election is that Trump is not entirely reliant on investments donations to run his campaign so normal propaganda isnt present to direct his speech. This is not necessarily true of every other advisor or official. He may want illegal immigrants deported he may want a more direct confrontation with Daesh he may want more jobs for the middle class  how and how much these views are utilized are disappointingly stagnant. ,skeptic,cukrhsn,1,t5_2qj8f

5102369,0,t3_3ktchf,Id say there are some serious methodological flaws on both sides here although some of that can be attributed to the desire to make interesting TV.The obvious one is that the muscle test itself is basically worthless. How do we know how much force the kinesiologist is applying? Is she applying it to the same point on the subjects arm each time? Is the subject more motivated to keep her arm straight at some times than at others? Is her arm getting tired as the experiment goes on?On the other hand this is hardly a comprehensive debunking using only one subject and one trial. Obviously repeating this experiment multiple times would make pretty boring TV though. But the kinesiologists objection that the crystal was wrapped in a bag seems to me a valid one. They are testing the hypothesis that certain crystals have a measurable physiological effect on humans  if that hypothesis is true its not unreasonable to suggest that the effect requires direct contact with the subjects skin. Furthermore using a little bag isnt really proper blinding since a bag of rat poison surely feels different when held to a bag containing a crystal. A better experiment would be to create placebo crystals out of coloured glass or plastic which would have the same appearance and tactile sensation as the real crystal made from quartz or whatever.,skeptic,cv10x49,2,t5_2qj8f

The entire point of us taking it was framed as understanding how other people may approach problems differently.  Its totally pointless to put someone into a descriptive label and say theyre an ENFP so of course theyre going to be overly emotional! but it can be useful to have descriptive words to understand people may have different needs or approaches to different problems.  I hate the taste of coffee. When I was younger I just assumed everyone hates the taste of coffee they just learned to ignore it because they enjoyed caffeine.  Learning about personality differences whether theyre based on observation and statistics or scientific and rigorous study is critical for people to understand that just because they feel a certain way or would act a certain way doesnt mean someone behaving differently is doing it maliciously.That said I dont think MBTI is particularly good at the use but I think its easier to grasp the basic concepts than alternatives and it only has  term that people will be offended by Im not introverted!

5498092,0,t3_3qb239,Ive said it before that Adam ruins everything doesnt belong on this sub. In every video Ive seen he generalizes cherry picks and makes spurious correlations and this video isnt any different. It totally misrepresents so much about wine and conflates so many different things that its hard to know where to begin. Yes there is a ton of bullshit involved in wine and there are plenty of different examples that show that wine ratings arent reliable and that peoples perception of wine can be easily manipulated. But there are also a ton of objective aspects to wine which is why deductive tasting is actually possible. Several of the terms used disparagingly in this video are actually objectively measurable componentsdry a level of sugar content and body a measure of viscosity  but because they are wine jargon Adam throws them in with the rest of the bullshit. Even the example of the wine experts being served white wine dyed red sounds fishy to me because besides color white and red should be easily distinguishable by tannins which are present in red and not present in white. Tannins are astringent which cause a very distinct mouth feel that should be noticeably  absent in a fake red.As for the relativist argument in terms of wine quality. I dont think many sommeliers will argue that at the end of the day it is all about what you enjoy and what you want to drink. The reason for having a sommeliers is to guide you towards what you want to drink. Do you want something that is fruity earthy dry or sweet? These are all easily discernible characteristics that a somme can use to help pick out a wine that you will like.Besides there are also some objective aspects to wine quality. Many top wines are considered as such because of their consistency as well as quality. The fact that you can trust a top producer to be good year in and year out is part of the reason their wines are so expensive. Not only do top producers consistently produce good wine they also produce wine that almost always age well. And you can look at plenty of factors that contribute to this from the skill of the vintner and the care put into the entire wine making process to the geography and climate of the vineyard. Yes part of the enjoyment of these wines is the mythos and the history behind them but you cant discount everything else that goes into making the wine.,skeptic,cwefltr,9,t5_2qj8f

Theyve learned that if they only push the narrative of one party on a controversial issue theyll lose their customers from the other party.So for every  or  stories about climate change from the climate activist point of view theyll look to run  or  from contrarians.  Reporters are busy and lazy so they turn to the think tanks they know.The think tanks with the most funding have the best PR teams and set up the best stories and interviews.  This is as true for CATOHeartland as it is for GreenpeaceSierra Club.This study seems to have missed a critical part of the network by only examining major media outlets.  Newer more minor media outlets think breitbart or dailycaller serve as a bridge between the bloggers where climate skeptic ideasdataadvocacy are born and the major media.

Wind energy creates less risk of harmful impacts to wildlife populations and habitats than coal oil natural gas and nuclear.If you were going to talk about cons for an argument you should have went with hydroelectric power. Yet even the temporary environment issues that establishing a dam can cause most notably on interfering with annual spawning of salmon and steelhead populations they are shortterm and easily managed disadvantages. This usually requires the simultaneous construction of salmon hatchery facilities in order to compensate. The main issue with older dams such as Grand Coulee in my home state is they were built without fish ladders which means it changes the ecosystem greatly above the dam. Modern dams are designed specifically with ladders and bypasses for marine life. Still their construction do cause shifts in rivers which can affect wildlife and human populations but rivers have also been known to shift naturally over time and nature does adapt. Where my house currently stands was at one time where a major river once flowed. That same river is now more than a mile away. Of course changing a rivers course isnt going to give anyone cancer or cause birth defects Argueable nuclear power facilities do both.

6223305,0,t3_40sevk,The meme of the mind virus is itself a belief attractor. It implies a qualitative ranking to certain belief systems which is ultimately subjective and relative to ones current belief paradigm. All memes propagate and reality cannot possibly be perceived outside of the memetic construct of a belief paradigm.The landscape can be flattened a bit if we identify that there is one property that drives the evolution of all belief systems propagation. Once we view reality from this perspective we can see that our own belief systems are no more valid than any other belief system save for their ability to propagate and survive. From here we can rediscover the scientific method as a tool that generates belief systems that have predictive power a power which improves survivability of the agent that carries it and thus the survivability of the system. But equally we must recognize that the belief systems generated by the scientific method may be replaced with newer systems that have greater predictive power. Systems of belief that have been since deprecated by models with greater predictive power may become mind virii relative to a new belief paradigm especially when those previous systems were socially satisfying. Thus the mind virus meme itself evaporates as we identify its internal bias.This perspective reduces the power of belief attractors and allows us to more easily question our own existing beliefs... And once again we have rediscovered skepticism.Awesome talk definitely worth watching.,skeptic,cyx0tbv,2,t5_2qj8f

The linked article actually gives a good view of the issue from both sides lets examine it.gtwellestablished fact that frying meat creates carcinogenic compounds.Whoah hoss. Lets back the skeptical train up. Youre technically right but your statement may also be completely irrelevant to the conversation. Lets examine the article you linked which does a good job examining the different sides of the issue at a high level which is nice.gtStudies have shown that exposure to HCAs and PAHs can cause cancer in animal modelsOk fair enough... Although it is only using animal models which isnt ideal esp for cooked food which is something only humans consume in a typical dietgtHowever the doses of HCAs and PAHs used in these studies were very highequivalent to thousands of times the doses that a person would consume in a normal diet.Ahh there we are. So maybe this is bad or maybe its irrelevant as a thousand time extra dose of water would straight up kill you toogtPopulation studies have not established a definitive link between HCA and PAH exposure from cooked meats and cancer in humans. Oh really? You mean the studies that wed want to actually care about havent shown anything? Huh.gtAlthough dietary questionnaires can provide good estimates they may not capture all the detail about cooking techniques that is necessary to determine HCA and PAH exposure levels. In addition individual variation in the activity of enzymes that metabolize HCAs and PAHs may result in exposure differences even among people who ingest take in the same amount of these compounds. Also people may have been exposed to PAHs from other environmental sources such as pollution and tobacco smoke.Lots of confounding factors makes sense.gtResearchers found that high consumption of welldone fried or barbecued meats was associated with increased risks of colorectal  pancreatic   and prostate   cancer.So were back to the good old chicken and egg association.

The roots of chiropractic are absolutely questionable  but this was also a time in which the traditional allopathic profession was bloodletting and dosing people with mercury on a regular basis. You need to put that in a historical context. I honestly havent seen a ton of evidencebased chiropractors on YouTube but maybe I just wasnt looking all that hard. I also wasnt trying to sound uppity about evidencebased chiropractic or what I still believe is a misinformed opinion on the profession. But seriously attacking an entire profession whose growing body of research has shown significant strides over the past few years and calling them all quacks isnt skepticism  its misinformed and incendiary. ,skeptic,czqp5jn,1,t5_2qj8f

As far as rightlibertarian publications go it is actually one of if not the best. It largely eschews the nuttiness of most other rightlibertarian outlets  no neoconfederate nonsense conspiracy theories etc. Good coverage of internal libertarian politics. Also generally pretty good on issues like civil liberties.That said it is still in the end a corporatebacked propaganda outlet. Its received tons of funding from rightwing corporate foundations and donors such as the Kochs and the Scaife Foundation. David Koch is also on the board of trustees.They will reliably take a proindustry position but often without being overt about it. The article posted is a good example. It dances around the subject without outright denying global warming but leaving the impression that climate models are bullshit. The picture is quite a bit different than what the linked blog by one of the coauthors suggests. This is pretty typical of Ron Bailey their science editor. Bailey is a technophile and Singularitarian so science is awesome as long as it doesnt conflict with the profit motive.

His works in turn are primarily based on Maurice Doreals writings on the topic with Doreal claiming he found some Emerald Tablets Which also gave name to his next writing on the topic a poem called The Emerald Tablets that detailed them but were largely just lifted from Lovecraft Robert E. HowardAlso creator of Conan the Barbarian Clark Ashton SmithA lovecraft contemporary who is largely forgotten nowdays and Ray PalmerEditor of Amazing Tales! writing under the psudonym Richard S. Shaver.Other fun facts  Icke thinks Kris Kristofferson is a Reptoid who may or may not run hollywood. Icke has frequently been accused of being an Antisemite and using Lizard people as a code word for Jews. However he doesnt think Jews run hollywood or anything else more than anyone else and is quite explicit about the fact that he means shapeshifting lizard people from space absolutely literally. Despite believing that Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an absolutely real and correct document he takes a refreshingly novel view at least among conspiracy theorists  not that Jews run the world because of Protocols but rather that when Protocols refers to Jews its actually a codeword for Lizard people.As an unrelated side note some dude wrote under the pen name Dick Shaver which puts him at direct odds with my own favored psudonym Harry Paratestes.,skeptic,d1w3o36,14,t5_2qj8f

7298354,0,t1_d27lom0,Regular medicine uses different medications for the same disease too.  And who is prescribing mentally sound patients a placebo out of a study setting?. If something doesnt work you tell the doctor and you try alternatives.  Doctors use their knowledge and experience to prescribe the best treatment for that situation they dont follow some immutable predetermined script unless they are pretty shit at their job.Ive found physicians to be highly receptive to medication changes.  Some have gone the extra mile to provide samples and supporting documentation to get me on a medication quickly when the insurance company is resistant.  Ive even asked for a specific medication and gotten it when I took it temporarily for other issues and it affected my chronic condition.  I have systemic scleroderma and myosotis and I contracted shingles while I was taking some powerful immunosuppressants.  While hospitalized I was given Gabapentin to help control the pain in addition to other pain relievers.  I found that my chronic pain was severely improved while on the Gabapentin even when I was using the same type and dosage of pain relief as I did at home.  I asked my rheumatologist if we could try this as I wanted to stay off narcotics but my pain was worsening  he agreed to try it.  It helps a great deal so hes on board with keeping me on it long term.I tend to think that this fits a narrative for some people who have really only gone to the doctor for minor issues and yes the doctor doesnt sit down for an hour and go through a detailed medical history  they get a basic idea and treat it and expect you to return if it doesnt work out.  Dont get me wrong there are some areas for chronic conditions that could be improved.  I do wish there were better ways of bringing multiple specialists together for unusual and severe cases outside of a hospital setting but I am highly skeptical of a doctor who wants to treat my spirituality.  I dont think theyre going to do a better job of dealing with usual issues than a GP who already does take a basic history and lab tests into account Im not sure why thats considered unusual its quite standard and they cant be a specialist in everything so what do they add?  It sounds like theyre just spending more time with the patient  no doubt making the patient feel more attended to but adding great expense  and going into some areas that really dont need to be considered for every single disease.  A psychiatrist may be concerned if I dont feel a sense of purpose in my life but I sure dont need to discuss that when I have a broken leg or high blood pressure.,skeptic,d27rugu,2,t5_2qj8f

Theres after all no other option.gtIm appreciative of the principle of unintended consequences in general and I feel its a particular concern when were talking about something as complicated and still relatively poorly understood it seems to me as a genome.gtRelated to  I worry about issues of e.g. fundamentally unpredictable mutations and modified organisms ability to repair or otherwise accommodate them or biodiversity and ecological impacts if these organisms are released into the biosphere.The thing is this fear is extremely inconsistent and in fact mostly unrelated to actual GMOs.Random unknown mutations that have never been investigated and have occurred over many years. FinePlanting plants that originate from entirely different parts of the world. Fine.Cloning plants by chopping pieces of and growing these over entire fields. FineInbreeding plants so that all the offspring has the exact same genome and thus predictable traits.Fine and a staple of most heirloom plantsAttaching one piece of a plant directly to another living plant Fine.Combining two strains which have never encountered each other in real life fine.Exposing a plant to radioactive rays or chemicals to induce unknown mutations Thats actually perfectly organic food.Inserting a well known and characterized gene with one specific function into another plant.Oh no that may be dangerous.Basically the idea that GMOs would be more dangerous than other types of plant breeding relies on the notion that the scientists involved are so incompetentevil that they would get worse results than simply randomly damaging DNA.Yes unforeseen consequences can exist.

Out of place to whom?Out of place as an evo psych paper. gtIf the article is supposed to indict a field or its members then at the very least it should be published in an journal that focuses on that field and is edited by proponents of that field. If the article does not even do that then it does not even begin to do what it set out to accomplish.Not necessarily as the point isnt that it fooled people. The point is just that a satire paper looks very similar to real papers which are peer reviewed and published by evolutionary psychologists. gtThe article wasnt rejected. They asked for modifications and he declined. They held the article for a while and then they asked him if they could publish it in a special issue.It was initially rejected as it didnt fit the purpose of their journal but they decided to make the most of it by setting up a special issue where they asked him to make modifications then.gtThe key difference being that one of them chose a journal run by proponents of that field and the other was not. That is a necessary aspect that this type of hoaxstunt needs to achieve any debunking of a field.Again I have no problem saying Sokal was being a little disingenuous. But his stunt was closer to achieving what it set out to do.I just dont see why its a particularly relevant difference.

We are. We brought that shit on ourselves.Irony of ironies we used that attack as an excuse to attack Iraq in yet another grab for oil. The cynicism is staggering.Okay let me lay this out differentlyin  Iran had a democratic government. The US overthrew it in favor of an autocratic dictatorship thus inflaming middle east resentment against the US. And lets be clear here This was the worst kind of dictatorship utterly oppressive that set the stage for a counterresponse as horrible as Khomeini.in  Ayatollah Khomeini overthrew the oppressive puppet government in place. Khomeini is the one who dubbed the US The Great Satan. Middle East scholars agree that terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism in a form of resistance against Western culture and civilization arose from the leadership of Khomeini and spread across the region. Both Wahabist and Shia sects bought into the idea that their mutual enemy was the US. The Saudi government where most of the  attackers came from has been simultaneously selling us its oil and literally bribing the Wahabist clerics in Saudi Arabia with the money we give them. Those clerics spend literally all of their time railing against the US.

9294455,0,t1_d8u4fmj,All knowledge we can have is going to be inherently subjective because knowledge by its very nature exists in the mind. As much as we like to think we can eliminate all of our bias such a thing simply isnt realistically possible.Now as far as well established theories and formula in physics math chemistry or similar fields go I think the degree of subjectivity involved in the theories themselves is going to be very little. But the same cant necessarily be said for how those results are found or derived how theyre taught how theyre presented how the math behind them is solved or any other number of tangentially related fields.And this could manifest itself as a problem in a whole number of ways. For example professors using units that they were taught rather than the units that their students are familiar with. Yes the math behind the units works out to be the same either way but a student familiar with the units used is going to have a much easier time with estimating doing dimensional analysis performing experiments and other similar tasks. Or you might look to Computer Science and the relative lack of programming languages based on anything other than English  thats going to be a potentially major barrier to entry for anyone who doesnt speak English.Heck even in Math the purest and most objective field imaginable things like not being familiar with the specific notation used or having learned a different conception of an operation like multiplication can hugely affect a students ability to understand the material. And if the teacher doesnt take that into account and just assumes Oh this knowledge is going to be understood in the exact same way by everyone as it was by me because its objective! I think its clear how groups of students might be disadvantaged. As an aside those groups of course arent always going to be Women. But the scope of academic Feminism has sort of expanded over the years to include analysis of a whole slew of related types of discrimination against minority groups so I wouldnt read too much into it. The point you should be getting is that a teaching method that assumes that all knowledge is objective is going to be teaching in a way that assumes all the students have had similar experiences and think like the teacher. And that will generally work great for white men who have had similar experiences and have been taught to think like the teacher but will often not work as well for women and minorities.,skeptic,d8u4zzw,3,t5_2qj8f

10709129,0,t3_5t3dac,gt These dramatic increases in traffic have significantly bumped each sites Alexa ranking by as much as  a key metric used in website valuation. Of note BBC.com experienced a similar boost and others may have as well.Some things to be suspicious of   The bbc.com experienced a similar boost. Unlike these other newspapers the BBC do not depend on ad revenue  in fact it is against their policy to even have ads because they are almost entirely funded through UK TV licenses. So why would they be paying for clicks? They literally have no reason to do this and as far as I can see the cons of doing this and being caught far outweigh the pros. If the BBC saw a boost in Chinese traffic then perhaps whatever was causing that also caused a boost in traffic to these other sites.  Why is this boosted traffic coming from China of all places? You dont need rows of poor people sitting in a basement to increase traffic to your site when you can do this more cheaply with a botnet. If this was a ploy to make it seem as though they were getting more traffic all of a sudden then why wouldnt they have used a botnet based in Europe or America? It would be unnecessarily stupid to run this from China when it is so easy for others to see where this increased traffic is coming from.  Correct me if Im wrong but I believe the way Alexa works is by tracking the websites visited by people that have a particular toolbar installed. If this is a conspiracy then why would a company who you can pay to draw traffic to your site have the Alexa toolbar installed which gives away that their location is in China?  Finally this conspiracy requires us to believe that all of these media organisation suddenly came up with the same idea at the same time to get a Chinese company to increase the click through rate on their website. Are we supposed to believe that all these media orgs are in cahoots and that this was a single coordinated campaign between multiple different disconnected companies?All in all this story smells fishy  You should probably expect to see a simple explanation for this coming out in the next few days.

11071730,1,t1_demvmh9,See  your first comment the debate is really over is part of the problem.  What debate did we have?  The whole global warming theory was embraced from the beginning when everyone saw how much money was to be made.  Much like a cult  believers were told that anything that shows they are wrong is to be ignored.  There are mountains of evidence to show that global warming is not a big issue.  You folks just choose to ignore it because it does not support your theories.As is very clear from your statements  you have drunk the KoolAid.  It is obvious that there is no proof that you would believe  no matter how definitive or accurate.  The scary part is that many believers treat scientific theories like Fact.  Look at your comment There are hundreds of thousands of years worth of data from ice sheets and other sources.  This is simply not true.  An ice core sample gives estimates based on THEORIES on what the data means.  They are a minuscule sample from a very limited part of the planet the poles.On top of the unproven accuracy of things like ice cores or fossil records remember  when we look at that stuff we are theorizing what the samples mean... we dont really know because we werent there when that sample was created believers ignore the most glaring issue with climate change research.... time.You make a point of saying we have thousands of years of data.  Simply not true.  We have accurate worldwide temperature data dating back less than  years when the first weather satellites were launched.   We have localized temperature records for many larger cities dating back  years or so with no way to verify the actual accuracy of any early data because the accuracy of older thermometers was not perfect.  For some older cities we may have temperatureweather records dating back several centuries.  But globally we do not have accurate records dating back.... lets say we will be generous... more than  years.Now your fossilice core records.  Most of these give just a glimpse of the overall climate  not an accurate record.  If a  year old tree has a thick ring one year... the weather must have been good  small ring the weather was bad.  If an ice core has a layer that is thick  it must have been cold... thin  it must have been warm.  I know they can sample the air molecules trapped to get a picture of the atmospheric conditions  but again  this is only available for very limited parts of the planet.  What it really boils down to is simple and this is the issue that changed me from being a Believer to a skeptic  we have scientists that are looking at a sliver of a sliver of a speck of our planets history  and telling us they know for a fact what is going on with our climate.  They say we are warming..... no shit.  Ten thousand years ago we were in an ice age and now we are not..... that means the planet is warming.  They make declarative statements about Facts  when they are actually theories.  And when these statements are proven wrong like predictions  years ago about what our current climate will be like they ignore these facts amp continue to make future predictions.Our planet is changing.  It has always changed  and it will long after we are gone.  We have been on the planet about . of its existence.  It is estimated that . of all species that have lived have already gone extinct.  We are only here for a short time.  The earth will eventually kill us if we dont all kill ourselves off first.  Instead of worrying about climate change  which will happen no matter what we do  we should worry about legitimate dangers to our existence.  We know FOR A FACT that our planet gets hit by comets amp asteroids that can wipe out huge portions of living things.  We know there are supervolcanos that would likely kill off most human population.  We generally have a worldwide disease pandemic every  years or so that wipes out as much as half our population and we are overdue for one of these. There are legitimate issues amp threats we can worry about and we should be spending our money on.  Yet we continue to research something that we have no way of knowing if it is real ampif it is real we have no way of stopping it  when there are things that are far more dangerous to our civilization.,skeptic,demyxv6,0,t5_2qj8f

I will answer from what I understand.From what I understand the claim involves reduction of certain psychological suffering like anxiety and depression. My problem with that claim is that I would have to be convinced meditation can do something that medications cant do or can be better than medication.I also have a problem with secular culture being okay with prescribing practices found in ancient religious texts while contridictoraly thinking that its somehow different than for doctors to tell their patients to try praying to God more because it could relieve their anxiety.The other side of these claims for benefits secular people make I believe which I could be wrong is that meditation can help someone become objective in their perceptions of everyday experiences much like a scientist would. For this claim with objectivity in perception being the goal I would think it would be way better to study logical fallacies cognitive biases and illusions than it would be to meditate. And can meditation do something that education in how to think objectively cannot do.I am not arguing that people who enjoy meditating should not meditate.

11373479,0,t1_dfl2kg6,My point is that a lot of people support things in the abstract without being willing to devote dozens and dozens of hours of research into it to be able to effectively regulate companies or to spend time and money seeking out specialty alternatives.For example if you ask people if they support child sweatshop labor their answer is probably going to be no.  If you ask them if they tried to look into the company that made the jeans theyre wearing to determine if any of their suppliers use child labor the answer is probably also going to be no.Regulating companies is difficult particularly because the information you usually want is often unavailable.  For example suppose you oppose mountain top removal coal mining or artic refuge oil.  Can you reasonably buy gas for your car made from a particular location?  Can you control the source of the fuel used to generate your electricity?,skeptic,dfl5w06,2,t5_2qj8f

11406807,1,t3_62s7kw,Im sure all of us believe in at least one conspiracy and it doesnt necessarily have to be a  commitment.Right after  Bin Ladens family was quickly rushed out of the US by the government.  Saudi funding of terrorism was undoubtedly instrumental in the attacks happening and the Bush administration did everything they could to distract from that fact.Some people might say that makes me a truther and Ill get lumped in with people who believe they were controlled demolitions.And why the fuck did Jack Ruby shoot Oswald?Being interested in the subject of conspiracy or even believing in a few of them to certain degrees isnt the same as putting an Infowars bumper sticker on your car excuse me personal conveyance used exclusively for travel not commerce ,skeptic,dfoy4hr,10,t5_2qj8f

11435121,0,t1_dfrr6in,gt Apart from the fact that I disagree because a conscious AI requires more than just code  it requires for that code to be executed and for that program to have a state.Yep. Its the same as the age old Chinese room fallacy. The ability to simulate a brain with its  trillion synapses goes way beyond what a lone human could do with a piece of paper. That would require an enormous amount of people as well as an efficient way for them to communicate. If a lone human is insisted on they would require an extraordinarily long lifespan as well as efficient data retrieval technologies etc. The more realistic you make the scenario the easier it is to see the whole system as being conscious just like the Chinese room.gtApart from all of that isnt this just an argument from consequences?For an argument like this to be taken seriously clearly a consistent definition of morality must be used throughout rather than flipflopping between whatever definitions seem more convenient at the time. Here a moral perspective that acknowledges the AIs human rights is assumed at first and then taken away at the end of the argument. So the argument is not just fallacious. Its selfcontradictory.,skeptic,dfs5r8y,2,t5_2qj8f

11506858,0,t1_dg09mrf,Got it. What I was driving at was the fact that in this case a parent is being forced by the courts to get their kid vaccinated. That seems a bit extreme when you consider how little loss of life or injury there is  even when vaccination rates are as low as . Its just a little odd to me that this kid has to be vaccinated but at the same time theres no law about blowing smoke in its face...because a law banning smoking would have a better effect on the health of the public and this kid than ringing a parent through the courts to get to a  vaccination rate. ,skeptic,dg0axls,1,t5_2qj8f

11794808,0,t3_689ms7,I like to say I pride myself on my critical thinking skills as a liberal and a skeptic. I think most of us on this sub would like to say the same if nothing else not to get all iamverysmart.But I think the hallmark of critical thinking is not the lack of biases but the awareness of your inherent biases and how devoted you are to overcoming them.It takes a certain humility to say jeez I feel really strongly about this but maybe my emotional is making me talk out of my ass a little bit and I really dont have all the information I thought I had. Or maybe this conclusion isnt so obvious I just really want to be able to say it is again am I sure I have all the information? Or lastly and this one is getting trickier and trickier these days am I sure the people who disagree with me have bad information lies and ill intentions. Isnt it possible that they have the same information and intelligence level as me but a different point of view?Its so easy to become selfrighteous and egotistical as a skeptics. We tend to be proud of our reasoning skills and that turns into arrogance. Randi is fond of saying the easiest person to fool is the one who thinks he cant be fooled.
