1092019,0,t1_chse1lv,That is true.  But people fail to realize that once youre ordained you cant marry for any reason at least on the Eastern side.So technically priests dont have the ability to GET married.  They have the ability to BE married.  So if the whole Church switched to the Eastern way of doing things the only thing it affects is the candidates in the seminary.Personally I have no issue with allowing already ordained priests to marry.  I think I would prefer that.,Catholic,chsezo1,3,t5_2qo4z

4840422,0,t3_3fvqj1,I was an atheist raised by atheists or spiritual divorced parents went to public school and hated God. And now I am Catholic. It was a crazy journey and I argued and fought the whole way...and still do. My first step was just praying to God for more information about God. And I thought it was silly but my friend now husband told me to try it as an experiment that I could toss aside after a month as a funny little thing I tried.  And it made a difference in my life enough to pursue the existence of God more seriously. One book that helped me was Theology for Beginners by Frank Sheed. He just lays everything out so perfectly and simply.Also you can look up philosophical arguments for God and start there. I like the story of a watch found in a desert. You wouldnt just assume the watch just always was there or it formed naturally on its own accord. Its so perfect and intricate and the parts move together with meaning... just like our universe and all of the little intricate nuances that have to happen to perpetuate life. Because of the complexity of the universe it must have had an intelligent and thoughtful creator.,Catholic,cu4o8ok,2,t5_2qo4z
4915784,0,t3_3e9lvv,We should not feel the need to explain ourselves to other religions. Mary is vastly vastly important. However she is not part of the trinity therefor not God and therefor not worshiped the bigboy word to use here is monotheism. As a female Catholic I find it degrading how some people believe we give too much attention to Mary. Catholics hold the women of our church in the high regard that they deserve and we should be able to do so without being treated like we worship other gods.,Catholic,cue67if,1,t5_2qo4z

5425646,0,t1_cw2q76n,For what its worth Id like to back you up on this you are correct. Also uMissionPrez said...gt I guess the Catholic church doesnt recognize Mormon baptism because Mormons dont believe in the trinity....and then said the formula used by Mormons for baptism was...gt Full name of person being baptized having been commissioned by Jesus Christ I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.To be clear uMissionPrez was right both times. I dont know why they got downvoted. You got an up from me as does any comment that contributes meaningfully to the discussion.This comes up frequently in RCIA. For our Jehovahs Witness and Mormon catechumen contemplating entering the Catholic Church we spend an extended period of time answering questions. Typically well have to answer the basic question of whether their baptism is valid No give an explanation for the benefit of the rest of the class on how the respective belief systems differ and offer to spend some time after class discussing baptism with them.I love my JH and Mormon converts and I relate to them a lot. While I was evangelical many of them have the same ambition and drive for seeking out the truth that brought me to the Church.,Catholic,cw56l35,3,t5_2qo4z

8959057,0,t1_d7nx5ls,Sad little keyboard warrior of an atheist.  Demanding God on ones own terms and then rejecting His existence when God does not reply favorably.  How can you possibly limit Gods ongoing familial relationship with us to simply Him giving us the Bible?  As if the Bible was the do all end all for Christians?  Maybe for protestants and their man made traditions.  But God gave humanity MUCH MUCH more than the Bible.  He gives Himself physicallyliterally every single day in the Blessed Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist.   ,Catholic,d7oqt6c,1,t5_2qo4z
