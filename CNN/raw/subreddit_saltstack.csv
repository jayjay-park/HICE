7474911,0,t1_d2rk1dc,No what you say about all external pillar data being available to all minions is incorrect.External pillars are actually really easy and the ones that come w Salt are good examples e.g. filetree.pyAn external pillar is pretty much a python function that gets called and passed the minion id.  It does whatever and returns the pillar data for that minion.,saltstack,d2ruqh2,1,t5_2u9v8

10991166,0,t1_dedryli,Im looking at this guys formula.  Have a look at his state.Basically Im wanting to set a pillar with everything but actual users or groups as I want them to be wiped out if there is one.  So if i just set the pillar data to limits with users and no user and limits with groups and no groups.  It should render a blank section for each.,saltstack,dedtb5a,2,t5_2u9v8
