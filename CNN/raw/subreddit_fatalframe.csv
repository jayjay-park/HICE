So it could have been a mistake but that would be a pretty BIG mistake for her to suddenly and mysteriously have an ultra rare camera that she never mentioned before. But maybe someone else will see this and chime in?It would be a pretty bad ending though...sadly FF has lots of bad endings ,fatalframe,db4i6kk,1,t5_2tp63
