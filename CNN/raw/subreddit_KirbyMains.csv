5646085,0,t1_cwwy0fa,Maybe around  for average weight characters on an average blastzone. I dont think Kirby has much trouble getting the first ish on a character so an  kill would still be too early. Not sure what that would mean for stages with high platforms though. Another way to go about it is to make uthrow kill around  on the top platform of battlefield and bthrow kill around  when next to the edge of a stage.,KirbyMains,cwwy9bu,1,t5_398n7
6789352,0,t3_488f8e,Marios Bair is deadly so just avoid letting him aproach with it you cant outspace it. You cant crouch his grab and his egdeguard game is potent due to his fast Dsmash and Invincible UPsmash always space recovery to snap it doesnt have a hitbox on the way up. Luckily you can jump out of most of his combos after about Luigi I have limited MU knowledge against but I think the most potent strategy is to get him on a platform inhale him and campsafe approach with fireballs and DtiltFtilt.Remember that UPsmash and UPtilt UPtilt works best are both disjoints and can easliy beat out falling nair if predicted. They dont really have any mixups when falling so UPtiltUPsmash really is the safest bet. A Plumber over you is a good plumber. This strategy is not limited to the plumbers but work fairly well against the two of them.Borak ,KirbyMains,d0lv0jh,1,t5_398n7

6929270,0,t1_d11q9jf,Besides hammer buffs. We got kbg for smash attacks I mean I guess we can kill a little earlier. Still crossing my fingers for air speed or another thing that can improve our neutral.,KirbyMains,d11ran8,1,t5_398n7
