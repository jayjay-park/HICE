900709,0,t1_ch6i5ve,Okay I just scanned through the OVA to try and get a better idea of what Rocks plan was.  Here are some highlights that I picked up.  If Im following it right  it seems like Rocks plan in addition to helping Garcia was to have the Americans destroy the drug trade that is fueling the gangs in Roanapur taking out all of the gangs controlling Roanapur at once.In the meeting of the gang leaders Chang says If we let people from the outside step into the ring with us. Who do you think will be left standing after the shooting stops?  My friends no one will be left. I wont you wont the city itself wont be here.Eda tells Chang through a voice scrambler The Americans primary mission is to infiltrate the Golden Triangle and capture Khun Sas righthandman General Shi Yan.  The General is to be extradited in order to face charges before the U.S. Supreme Court.  I believe that would be a most unfortunate turn of events for the Triad. Without the Generals poppy fields the Triads heroin refinement plant will have to shut down.Rock wants to help the Americans finish their mission helping them get out of the city and to the Golden Triangle.  Rock is looking for the person who controls Chang.  The real master of Roanapur but Eda tells him to stop digging.After the fight between Roberta and the Americans at the Golden Triangle Rock says Changs goal wasnt just about hiding Roanapur from the eyes of the world.  He also wanted to use Roberta to break Grey Foxs will.  This entire region produces drugs and Roanapur is the transit port that moves them. Chang wanted Roberta to attack the Americans to teach them a lesson to prevent the Americans from bringing justice to the Golden Triangle. That was his plan I changed it.Rock also says Way to go Garcia good work! I knew you could do it. Thanks to you I actually managed to do some good and save someone.It cuts to a CIA guy who talks with Eda about them getting jurisdiction and custody of Shi Yan.The final scene is Rock on the boat with Revy looking at Roanapur.  Rock says Its been months.  It seems like it is business as usual in Roanapur. Somewhere out there someone else won the bet.  I didnt save anyone.Revy says Its going to hurt if you keep looking at that city with life in your eyes.  But hey thats the path youve chosen.  Do what youve got to do so you dont become a real corpse. You came pretty close back there.Rock replies Yeah I did but this wasnt the time Revy.  Maybe some day.,blacklagoon,ch6nyz9,3,t5_2w1xv

8484278,0,t1_d620qpl,gt I think it was due to the effect of the twins and what happened in Japan slowly getting to him and i assume its expanded on further in thw manga i havent read itIt just felt off to say the least.gt Cant answer fully but it has been on a reaaaallly long hiatus which is why i havent read it lolSo I have heard. Problem with the publisher I think. Is it not popular on Japan?gt Uhhh theres a good uh doujinshi showing just that PI would honestly be surprised if there wasnt one. But that stuff is not much of my interest.Thanks for the answer. I hope someone can further expand on the answers to my nd and rd question.,blacklagoon,d622wmw,3,t5_2w1xv

8881567,0,t1_d5kgnkd,That was kinda my read on it too. Whether it be mutilation or whatever hell they both could be sexed male or both sexed female the fact that they swap genders and voices and personalities is symptomatic of some extreme disassociative trauma especially at that young of an age. After all its not like they simply identify as a different gender suddenly they take on the personality and the composure of an entirely different character suddenly. You dont get that unless something royally fucked up has happened to a kid that young which of course from their backstory we know to be true.The twins are so chilling because there is a hint of reality to their character which is what I love about Black Lagoon in general. Yeah sure one of them carries around a massive machine gun because anime action show but their reason for doing the shit theyre doing and their overall characters are both reasoned and grounded in reality.,blacklagoon,d7fft8p,1,t5_2w1xv
