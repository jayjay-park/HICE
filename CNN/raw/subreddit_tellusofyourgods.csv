465972,0,t1_cfsu9ps,I would suggest that you not use Wikipedia. Only Primary sources are worth reading.The number of Marian Apparitions Eucharistic Miracles and Incorrupt Saints the stigmatists etc. etc.   Do your research. One doesnt have to look far and the Church does not accept these happenings whole sale. They are scrutinized to the nth degree. The Church herself will say most happenings are fraudulent but the ones that make it have been tested in every imaginable way.  ,tellusofyourgods,cft8drv,1,t5_2t95y
