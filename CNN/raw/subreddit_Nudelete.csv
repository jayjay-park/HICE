4581743,0,t3_3ds8jw,gtMy sister was in prison for  years. She was released two months ago and is staying with me right now. She was in for selling weed on college campuses. She bought weed from other dealers in town and sold them at the parties for a higher price. gtgtMy boyfriend who doesnt live with me keeps going on and on about how this relationship is hurtful to me and she can bring me down with her as well. He says that even if what she was doing wasnt serious being  years in prison changes people and similar stuff that we hear everywhere. I have told him that its not negotiable and I dont want to hear about it but he doesnt stop ever. To add salt my own parents have already disowned her when she was arrested and didnt offer help during her prosecution. They never visited her either. This made my relationship with parents rocky too. Parents were upset at me for allowing her to stay here. gtgtHonestly this is frustrating. Im trying to help my sister get his life back on track find a job and get a place of her own so she can start living again but dealing with all these pressures on top of that is really stressing me out. I dont know what to do. Ive been close to telling my boyfriend to go fuck himself a few times but I kept in control since he otherwise is really nice and I love him.gtgtAny suggestion is welcome.gtgt   gttldr My sister just came out of prison and Im helping her adjust to life. Parents and boyfriend doesnt want me to help her or even stay in contact because they think shes become much worse in prison and is beyond saving.,Nudelete,ct84qmt,1,t5_38nn9

5016549,0,t3_3jncg0,gtMy girlfriend has some mental health issues from her childhood and her ex boyfriend and also has pretty bad anxiety. About  months into us dating she asked me to start turning my head away and not looking at nuditypartial nudity on TV or in real life like Game of Thrones going to the beach etc and then this evolved into not talking to other women. Stupidly I went along with it. gtgtRecently I decided Id had enough and was not going to live like this because it makes me feel like a child and a criminal kind of.. hard to explain. She said that it makes her uncomfortable because she doesnt know what Im thinking. I said that just because there are bare legs or boobs on TV doesnt mean Im thinking about it. Im an adult and I should be able to watch TV in peace or go to the beach without fearing that my girlfriend is gonna freak out on me for placing my order at the shoreside restaurant where the server is wearing short shorts. gtgtShe said she disagrees and that we should only see our partners skin etc. I understand how she feels but I dont think I can live like that forever and I told her that. She then said that I want to look at other people and no I dont. I just think its immature. I dont care if she talks to a hot guy. I dont care if she watches Fifty Shades Of Grey. Is it okay that this is kind of a deal breaker for me if it doesnt change? I do love her though so its really hard . Is it normal to look away from that stuff? Do most people do that? Ive only had one relationship.gtgtOther things are that she always wants to come over and spend the night together which is cool but not all the time. I told her I wanted some space and she said well what about married couples? they dont spend that much time apart. Shes pretty good at shooting down my points. Shes super insecure about my female coworkers who I only talk to at work and do not like other than as an acquaintance. She said she knows shes not always rational and she has a lot of selfhate because she was abused. I know its not really fair but Im not sure if I can continue to support her as a partner. I feel like Im not really happy. She also gets really moody when I see my friends without her and when I go out with coworkers.gtgtTLDR Girlfriend is super insecure says its a dealbreaker that I think I shouldnt have to look away from nudity on TVreal lifebikinis and not talk to my former female acquaintances etc.,Nudelete,cuqonfj,1,t5_38nn9
5162244,0,t3_3lps61,gtSo Ive been a big fan of Dougs new show Getting Doug With High since its creation. Never been a weed smoker but i enjoyed his show and the guests he would have on. For awhile Doug was advertising these disposable vape pens from blackoutx that you could use for wax and ejuice so i thought id give them a try since ive always wanted to get into vaping and ecigs. They were offering a trial on their website so i figured id give it a shot.gtgtFast forward a week later and i get my first pack of the blackoutx ecigs i watched some youtube videos and followed their directions on the website on how to reloadrefill them and properly use them with ejuices.gt gtThe first pen I tried didnt even work wouldnt light up nothing. Okay no biggie the trial gives you  so i crack open another one and give it a go. This one actually worked for a whole minute before failing to turn on just like the first device. The other two worked intermittently and would often leak ejuice from the mouthpiece and from inside the pen. None of them worked for more than two days and I barely used them to begin with. I even noticed that sometimes they would randomly turn on by themselves and not shut off heating up the pen immensely to the point if left unattend could easily start a fire. I had to completely disassemble one pen and remove the battery just to get it to turn off. So at this point im disappointed in the product and immediately go to cancel my trial.gtgtFast forward again to a week or two and i see in my mailbox another pack of blackoutx cigs...wtf? i cancled my trial why are they still sending me products? I checked my credit card and sure enough they are still charging me even after canceling.gtgtI proceeded to call up their customer service support line and was connected to some dude who sounded like he was driving around in a car or something and he tells me that he will call me back to fix the error when he gets back to the office. Cool. Except he never calls me back. I tried calling them and left multiple messages and emails for a week with no response.gtgtI finally got fed up with their bullshit runaround and sent them an email stating i was sending them back their unused products and wanted a refund immediatly or i would dispute the transactions with my credit card provider.gtgtAfter sending this email i was met with extremely hostility from their support staff not only disrespecting me but flat out refusing to refund me even though i had already canceled my trial and was sending them back their products. After i told them i was going to post this on reddit and what not they sent me this emailgtgtgtgtTelling me to eat my own dick. Very professional. Just wanted to share this with everyone stay far away from this company they are extremely toxic. They gave me the run around for weeks and flat out disrespected and insulted me as a customer. But i was finally able to get my money refunded thanks to my credit card provider after giving them all this information.gtgtSo unless you like shitty ecigs that work  of the time could possibly burn your house down and customer support that bullshits you and insults you then stay far away from this company.,Nudelete,cv88qec,1,t5_38nn9

This happened until I was  so my mom would never let me see him. He got clean a few years back but married a woman who disliked me. Therefore he did not want to see me. Ive only just fully adjusted to accepting the fact that he is out of my life but he relapsed in drinking last year. He has been trying to contact me but I ignored him every time. The thing is it was and still is too mentally exhausting for me to deal with him.gtgtIt started with his liver. Now most of his organs are shutting down like clockwork. He is very sick and is practically pleading to spend a day with me and Ive decided to give it a shot. For peace between the two of us. gtgtI go and see him tomorrow before he gets moved to another hospital. Im not sure what to expect. gtgtRemember forgiving is for yourself not for the other person.

5404394,0,t1_cw2gzlm,gtAlso tell her to push against your PC muscle using two or three fingers or a fist works well while shes going down on you. It makes you last longer and feels great but its pretty hard to do during actual sex.gtgtGetting a cooldown period with no stimulation like you get while going down on her will increase how long you last significantly and make your orgasm more intense. gtgtAlternatively depending on how long your refractory periods are you could get off when shes going down on you then recover for round two which lasts longer while going down on her. Up to you.gtgt Using Positions for EdginggtgtNow getting your partner to edge you during foreplay is easy but during sex its a little different. You dont want to keep stopping and starting thrusting since thats going to be frustrating for her and itll make you feel self conscious and start worrying about cumming too soon.gtgtInstead you can edge yourself just by switching up positions.gtgtSome positions will move you up arousal stages faster. Others less so. Its a combination ofgtgt. Friction more  fastergt. Direction of motion thrusting  faster back and forth  slowergt. Control you moving  faster her moving  slowergt. Your position standing  slowest supporting with your arms e.g. missionary  fastestgtgtA position with her legs more closed more friction plus you doing the thrusting while lying down e.g. missionary will be high stimulation and get you off faster.gtgtBut a position with her legs spread and you standing or kneeling will be much lower stimulation. Same story if shes on top of you moving back and forth instead of up and down. gtgtIf youre not sure what I mean by back and forth vs thrusting well this is the only way to explain it SUPER NSFW.gtgtYou need to find your low stim and high stim positions. Get in the high stim positions when youre at a  or  then switch to low stim positions when youre at an  or  to bring it back down.gtgtMost importantly while youre switching take a few seconds to squeeze your PC muscles!gtgt BreathinggtgtThis is a short one but important the way you breathe affects how quickly you cum.gtgtYouve heard about how you can trick yourself into being happier by making yourself smile right? Well you can also make yourself more or less aroused by changing your breathing.gtgtIf you want to bring yourself down slow your breathing and make sure theyre deep belly breaths. Taking quick breaths in your shoulders and chest is what you do when youre about to cum so if youre doing that your body thinks youre close. gtgtgtgtBreathe like youre fine and youll become fine.gtgt MOST IMPORTANT Clamp When You Get Too ClosegtgtThose first three tips will help you stay in the  range. But what happens when you get to . and you dont think theres any way to stop yourself from cumming?gtgtHeres what training those PC muscles has led to. Assuming youve gotten them strong enough all you need to do to bring yourself back from that point of no return is stop thrusting and clamp down HARD like a long kegel hold or a combination of shorter ones if you found that worked better for you. gtgtThe longer you squeeze for the more youll come down. With practice you can take yourself from a . to a  or  in a few seconds and add another  minutes to your sex. gtgtHeres the catch though it works better the closer you are to cumming when you do it so youre going to have some misfires. But with practice youll start noticing when is the right time to squeeze and youll get better and better at pulling yourself back from the edge.gtgt Go Forth...gtgtAnd thats it. One psychological change two exercises to keep you in good sexual shape three techniques to manage how quickly you heat up and then the last second squeeze to bring you back. Thats all you need.gtgtIts just a matter of execution. Do the exercises be open with your partner about what youre working on and youll see results in less than a month.gtgtAnd if there was anything in the article you want more info on let me know in the comments!gtgtgtgtOriginal link for anyone curious Last Longer in Bed Getting to  Minutes and BeyondgtgtgtHope this helps some of you!gtgtNatgtgtEDIT Realized I didnt have links to the pictures of the graphs.

Sure I talked a lot but it was only because all of the chatter was our Corki absolutely crapping on people. gtgtIm one of those loser whales who has put a lot of money into skins because Im stupid like that. Hundreds maybe even a thousand dollars total since I started playing  years ago. I was permabanned. banned less than a minute after this game ended. I cant imagine anyone had time to receive a new report among all others read through it and make a decision to permaban someone. I was permabanned by trolls. This system is set up for that now.gtgtgtgtgtThe main reason Im complaining is simply that the new system of reports is just a popularity contest. If you have a bad game your team reports you. Just like the unskilled player report only this one actually does something. Since there is no more tribunal unpopular people simply get banned now. If you get enough people reporting you you get the punishment without a check! That means if youre defending someone whos having a bad game but end up having a bad one yourself you will probably get reported. gtgtIve actually been complaining about this system for a while but I never get any support. The posts are always immediately downvoted because other people dont have this problem so they assume it isnt a problem.gtgtIn chat I said to please report Corki for verbal when he kept saying to report me and Lux for being garbage players. gtgtI understand I talked too much. I understand I didnt say much to help the game. I was hoping during this game to lift the mood a little and Corki had a mission to make sure I didnt do that. gtgtIn this current report system trolls win. People who they tilt lose. What was wrong with tribunal that they just allow players in games to make decisions on who gets banned?gtgtSUGGESTIONS FOR TRIBUNAL gtgt Ill add more if anyone else has any suggestions to bring tribunal backgtgt I think the reason they got rid of tribunal and started this system is because tribunal was too slow. My solution for this is to allow people to alleviate their ban punishments by contributing to tribunal. Read a certain amount of cases get a certain amount of chat bans removed or ban days removed. gtgt Give rewards for tribunal. Not just an icon for having an agreeable opinion but make it an IP grind! Maybe not as much as a game but just some kind of reward for grinding out tribunal.gtgtgtEdit Yes Im OCD and reading pretty much everything and possibly replying to almost all of it.gtgtYes Ive been banned a good few times. Ive played for  years. The past few bans happened abruptly in a short amount of time shortly after the games ended definitely before anyone had a chance to look at them.gtgtYes I did travel to another lane though it was agreed upon by the players as okay.gtgtNo this isnt for an appeal. Though it would be appreciated Ive always wanted us to bring back a new and improved tribunal. gtgtgtgtHOPEFULLY FINAL EDIT so Lyte asked for my report link which I gave. He then asked me for my previous report cards and I mentioned that Im fully aware my previous reports were punishable and I didnt try to hide it in this thread. I said Id rather not send them because it would obviously take away from the point of my post which is to just bring back a functional tribunal system and work on improving it but I dont think thats really an option.gtgtIts going to be a shame when I get lynched about my previous games when Id just like to overturn this last ban though its been pointed out that telling someone they are muted and asking people to report someone whos himself spamming chat to report other people are both banable offenses. I guess I just never got these memos. gtgtThanks for the support everyone. Honestly I dont deserve it. I didnt want this to turn into an appeal thread. I was hoping to open up more discussion about ways to improve and return tribunal properly but this has just become a personal drama I was hoping to avoid.gtgtIt would be cool to get that last report taken so that I could just mute people for the rest of my games that were toxic knowing that one fuckup was a perma but rightfully so based on my previous reports if I cant get that I think Id be doing myself a favor to move on. Its been fun gtgtTime for bed. Gonna turn off inbox replies because RIP but Ill definitely do one final final update if they give me the last report back. Though I feel like it will still just get triggered again by something else and I doubt Ill ever make the front page here again to complain about it P GNIGHT MY FELLOW RAGERS,Nudelete,czdoipp,1,t5_38nn9

6453497,0,t3_4429m6,gtFor a little bit of background info I currently live in student halls. Since I have to study quite a lot I usually spend a lot of time in the study area which is relatively far from my room. So there is this disabled toilet available a few steps away. After having eaten a lot of chinese food and reading through my regular texts I suddenly realize it is time to unload the former. Obviously time was pretty important so I just hurried to said toilet unloading a very nasty piece of art.gtgtAt this time I have already fucked up.gtgtAfter having realized the lack of toilet paper I had two choices. One of them was running back to my room a solid  minute walk with a crappy bum... The other one was washing it off with a little bit of hot water at the sink. So I chose the latter.gtImagine the following. Happy me being absolutely stunned by my own creative problem solving skills while lifting one leg and holding my bum into the sink contently washing off the nastiest thing I have ever seen.gtgtRemember the part about hurrying?gtgtA second later the door swings open. The first thing I see is the absolutely disgusted face of a local security guard in the distance while the door keeps opening and the girl Ive been hitting on takes a dynamic entry into the lavatory. Door does not close. Water is still flowing into my anal cavity. A few seconds pass. I become terrified. While trying to get my shining clean bum away from the sink I almost started falling. To prevent further humiliation I grab the first thing that I can. The red handle next to the toilet. gtgtNever pull the red handle.gtgtNobody talked about this so far.gtgtFun Fact The red handle serves as an emergency tool if a disabled person requires assistance in the toilet.

6486269,0,t3_44hlzz,gtTrump makes outlandish and ridiculous comments. He panders to the far right and his views are at least mildly racist and even if he were to become president his policies would never be allowed to take effect. There would never be enough support in congress and even if there were there would certainly be constitutional questions that would hold them up in court for years.gtgtExcept Bernie Sanders is the same way for the far left. Its nice to talk about paying for everything for everybody healthcare education unemployment benefits etc but there is no way the taxes he wants to implement would ever make it through congress. Any politician that supported it would be a pariah in their home state. Bernie got elected bc he comes from a small state and is a good person with admirable ideals and views. But on the whole his policies could not work at the national level. Its like comparing the US to Iceland. Its nice that they let their banks fail instead of bailing them out but their economy is roughly the same size as Delaware. The US banks have global implications and letting them fail would have triggered a global crisis. This is not a discussion of whether the banks should be that big or not please do not sidetrack the discussion with that debate that is a whole other can of worms.gtgtThere is simply no way Bernie can pay for all the things he wants to do. As an example this article by CNN lays out all the ways Bernie says hes going to pay for everything. Except for a few caveats. He hasnt explained how to pay for his health care plan at all. The health care plan would cost more than all the rest combined. Also on one of his plans his policy advisor thinks theyll make  million but studies and experts say it will most likely be . Bernies policy advisors answer theyre being conservative. Ok. With a difference of  million? The other plans are almost ridiculous and are going to get so much blow back from the business world there is no way they will ever happen. A . tax on all stock trades? A lot of stock trades dont even profit .. And how about the trades where people are selling out of a falling stock and are already losing money? This will just compound the loss. Especially for high volume trades. And the extra payroll taxes would absolutely destroy small businesses especially with any increases in minimum wage. There would simply be no way small businesses could afford that. A lot of small restaurants and other businesses make maybe k in profit a year if that. That has to support the owners families and any expansionsreinvesting to the business. A lot of companies dont even make that much or anywhere close to it. Higher minimum wage  payroll taxes would destroy that small as it is profit margin. So you would see a lot of business go bankrupt or a lot of small business owners basically working their ass off for pennies.gtgtNone of his plans are even sensible in the least. And even if he somehow managed to make it to office getting a consensus in Congress would be a lost cause before he ever even showed up. Even most democrats wouldnt support him. Its great he wants to take care of poor people but poor people dont pay for expansive political campaigns. And any politician Democrat or Republican that supported raising taxes to  for anyone making over k in their district not to mention the additional payroll tax added to that would hit all business big or small whether the owner is making k or is losing money that Bernie wants to add would not find themselves being supported very long. gtgtIn reality. Bernies plans are so unrealistic that he is almost a crazier candidate at least economically than Trump.gtgtAnd I think he knows this. But he is pandering to the left economically in the same way that Trump is pandering to the right socially. gtgtgtgtgtgtgt Hello users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

On the one hand I feel like a cheap unloving cold asshole if I ask her to pay rent while we cohabitate but on the other hand I would think from someone who makes a six figure income this is not a problem and is simply ones own personal responsibility to financially cover their carbon footprint.

Well on first inspection this may sound like a good idea. ISIS does do a lot of its organizing online. But at the same time this sounds like the same kind of reasoning that got the Patriot Act passed. According to Last Week Tonight and Edward Snowden this allows the government to know multitudes about our personal lives including Last Week Tonight and Edward Snowdens words not mine the size of our junk for the guys out there.gtgtThis means we dont know how far the government AKA the oligarchy will take this antiISIS initiative to protect our better interests. Its a very thin line between taking down ISIS websites for national security and then taking down say a massive protest on Washington DC about money in politics organizational website for national security or how about taking down a website criticizing the United States drone policy because that would weaken the fight against ISIS? gtgtYou dont have to be a lawyer to know the words of the laws that would allow this kind of thing despite their best intentions can easily be twisted to allow evil to be committed.gtgtIt may not get to that worst case scenario but for the love of god we shouldnt ever put ourselves in a situation to where this could happen.

8275826,0,t3_4sttkq,gtWP Instead of a dystopia that seems like a utopia on the surface write a story about a utopia that seems like a dystopia on the surface.gtgtgtgtA lot of people were unhappy when the world went to shit but not James Henderson. For him it had all been a dream come true. gtgtIt started with drugs. Growing refining smuggling James did it all. But he always knew that he wouldnt be limited to just one market. When war broke out in the Middle East yet again one of Jamess shell corporations was right in the thick of things selling equipment to the Russians and the Americans. And another of his shell corporations was on the other side selling the very same equipment to Iran and its allies. Very few people found Jamess joke about making a killing off of all of this killing very funny but James had enough money to not give a fuck what they thought. gtgtThen came the instability at home. The U.S. government paralyzed by partisan bickering and now massively in debt and unpopular because of the war eventually just fell apart. State governments came together into coalitions all vying to be the replacement power. And most people in the country suffered for it... except for the ones like James. He had enough money to fly out on his private jet down to his own private villa in Brazil. And all the while his media outlets in the States continued pushing the war agenda and simultaneously grew his fortune. gtgtAnd when disease struck James was in the right place at the right time yet again. His stock in that pharmaceutical company skyrocketed when they finally created a viable vaccine though the millions whod already been infected were kind of shitoutofluck. A man like James could afford the best doctors and the security at his gates screened out anyone who could be carrying the disease. gtgtFrom his living room James watched the world crumble. And he didnt care. He had everything that he needed and was one of the few people in the world who seemed to recognize the opportunities that came along with every tragedy. Everyone was wrong James mused to himself. Money really can buy happiness. gtgtgtgtKate Lewis checked the computers data readout. James Henderson now aged  living insimulation for the past  years. Vital signs all seemed to be normal and the worldgenerating processes were all running smoothly. gtgtShe glanced around making sure that no one was looking. Of course the hallway was deserted nearly everyone was living insimulation now and she was the only tech on duty. So she decided to take a little peek into James Hendersons world. Technically her company Simulacorp offered complete privacy to every customer. A persons simulation is based on their personality. It reflects their wants their needs their desires no matter how taboo. So discretion was generally the key here. But Kate had always been a bit of a snoop and the desire to find out how all of these people were living was practically overwhelming. gtgtShe put on the goggles plugged into the external jack and was instantly horrified by the Pablo Escabaresque fantasy world she saw. Throughout her years at Simulacorp shed seen all sorts of scenarios with some lessthansavory elements. But this man had apparently driven the entire planet into the ground just so that he could be king of the ashes.gtgtDamn she whispered to herself as she took off the goggles and moved on to servicing the next customers computer.

8929770,0,t3_52lnik,gtHi my name is Paul Helquist Professor and Associate Chair of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame.  I was a native of Northern Minnesota where I grew up literally in the sticks on a small lake surrounded by woods somewhere north of Duluth on the way to the Canadian border. I attended school in a small town of  people  miles away from our home and was the stereotypical example of the first member of our extended family to attend college.gt gtgtI enrolled at the University of Minnesota Duluth in  on a freeride scholarship which paid for my full tuition which was all of  per year in those days. I had the common problem of deciding upon a major and a career. I kept wavering back and forth among physics astronomy medicine and dentistry but not yet chemistry. I initially opted for physics but in the midst of taking some chemistry courses as required for physics majors I was working on lab course experiments one day when a brand new gungho assistant professor Bob Carlson came into the lab and said Follow me. I was a little taken aback but he took me greatly bewildered to his very small twoperson research lab and said This is where youre going to work as a substitute for taking that lab course. That was a very fateful event. It was a synthetic organic chemistry lab. I quickly fell in love with the research changed my major to chemistry and was very fortunate to be able to publish two journal articles with Bob Carlson.  My odyssey in synthetic organic chemistry continued at Cornell where I earned my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in a little over three years under the direction of another young super enthusiastic assistant professor Martin Semmelhack and at Harvard where I did postdoctoral research for a year and a half with Nobel Laureate E. J. Corey.gt gtgtI was then set to begin my own career at age  but I had tremendous difficulty making a decision about which of the positions to accept that had been offered to me at a pharmaceutical company chemical companies or universities. Well here I am now after choosing the academic route and having been a faculty member for  years.  In  I began as an assistant professor at SUNY Stony and in  I was recruited to Notre Dame when it was entering a period of tremendous investment and growth in graduate and research programs.gt gtgtThis career path has led to living and working in several places including Minnesota New York Massachusetts Indiana and even in Sweden and Denmark where I have held a number of visiting positions. I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in organic chemistry and run a research group which has generated over  publications and patents in the following areas  development of new synthetic methods design and development of transition metal reagents and catalysts for selective synthetic reactions total synthesis of natural products synthesis and applications to new pharmaceuticals including antibacterial and antitumor agents and treatments for rare inherited diseases as part of an international network of collaborators in the U.S.A. Europe and Asia. A therapeutic agent developed in my lab is currently being used in an FDAapproved human clinical trial. I have also served in many university administrative and service positions as Chair of the Chemistry Board of Examiners for the Graduate Records Examination at the Educational Testing Service as the Director of the National Science Foundation Workshop for College Teachers of Organic Chemistry as a regional and national leader in the Siemens Math Science and Technology Competition as a consultant to the pharmaceutical industry and head of an Indiana statewide program for clinical translational research at Indiana University Purdue and Notre Dame.gt gtgtSince  I have offered special courses on advanced synthetic organic chemistry on over  occasions at sites throughout the U.S.A. Canada and Europe under the auspices of the American Chemical Society and several other sponsors. My present ACS course Organic Synthesis Methods and Strategies for the st Century Chemist emphasizes the latest developments in this field and is next scheduled for this coming November  in San Francisco followed by several offerings in .gt gtgtI am very enthusiastic about answering as many questions as time permits about any of the aspects of the career area in which I have spent the last half century.

10387903,0,t3_5orsb6,gtIm an attorney but have encountered a legal issue regarding school boards which I have no experience or knowledge of so I could use your help making sure I have all my boxes checked. Beware  wall of text.gtgtHeres the issue gtgtMy friend Steve married a nice woman named Sarah. Sarah is from a small hick town in Ohio. Steve moved to this hick town to live with Sarah. Sarahs father George sexually abused her when she was an infant. Sarahs mother Dumbass was informed by medical professionals that her daughter had been sexually abused. Instead of informing the authorities that her husband was sexually abusing their child Dumbass used this information to make sure George gave her everything she wanted in their subsequent divorce. At no point were charges filed. gtgtYears later George working as a teacher had inappropriate relationships with his students all female and underage  years old. Im unsure if the relationships were ever physical. Dumbass knew of these relationships after having discovered letters between George and his students they had reconciled at this point but this situation broke them up again  ugh I hate these people. The school district he worked for also received complaints from parents. Being a backwards hick small town where nothing makes sense the school board asked him to resign in lieu of filing charges. He was told if he didnt resign the state would take away his teaching license. He resigned with no charges pending and still in possession of his teaching license. gtgtDumbass was recently elected president of the school board in what Im now calling Shittown USA. There was a teaching position open in this district to which George applied. The board reviewed his application and he was ultimately hired. At no point did Dumbass disclose privately or publicly what she knew about George. gtgtSteve and Sarah are horrified. Sarah has dealt with lifelong repercussions from the sexual abuse she endured as a child. Dumbass has forced Sarah and Steve to interact with George on many occasions. Frankly knowing Steve Dumbass is lucky no one has been murdered. Yet. gtgtSarah and Steve have urged Dumbass to come forward with what she knows. Dumbass is hesitating and defensive. Steve believes that Dumbass is high on power from being president of the school board in Shittown USA. Dumbass says she will make sure George is fired but she has to do so at the right time because there might be legal ramifications for her if she fires him at the wrong time. I know. I know.gtgtSteve and Sarah want to come forward with what they know but cant for many reasons I wont get into here. Instead Steve reached out to me Amazing Lawyer Girl to see what I can do. I told them I would file an anonymous complaint to make sure it wont come back on them. gtgtHeres where you brilliant people come in  HOW do I go about this?

And Im not even speaking of the  different colors that make no sense. And just look at the Apple Watch and try to understand whats going on apple watch  apple watch Nike apple watch hermes apple watch edition apple watch ... Seriously what the heck is that thing?gtgtSpeaking of technology Apple has fallen so far behind its not funny anymore. The iPhone SE still comes with GB!!! Sixteen GB!!!!! Is this some kind of joke? My operating system takes more than  GB! How many minutes of video can  you record with GB! Compare that to Android which often come with SD cards and possibly terabytes of data and youve got a real joke on your hand. And almost every Android phone outperforms the iPhone in every mark. The iPhone isnt even the top phone anywhere anymore  its gone people!gtgtAll in all we face the same problems we faced in  when Apples stock crashed from  to  dying business lines iPod at the time and no innovation at all. Apple was able to save face once and then again not really it underperformed the index from  to today only going up  in  years in a period where the SampP basically doubled. Tomorrows dreadful earnings will mark the end of Apple as an innovative company as we know it. It will now be priced as a commodity company and this implies a much much lower valuation.gtgtGoogle is still able to grow. Microsoft is still about to grow. Apple is about to report a sharp drop in earnings around  and perhaps as large as  if they are honest they can still fudge the number somewhat. With much lower iPhone sales its simply not possible for them to beat the very inflated earnings estimates. This sharp drop in earnings coupled with a terrible guidance for the rest of  strong USD world tensions due to Trump Apple failing in China  all points I dont have time to cover but which are very valid will lead to Apple getting one of the biggest hits in the history of hits.gtgtIll be blunt Apple will drop  in afterhours maybe more it will open down  the next day and end the day down more . Yes thats how bad it is.gtAnd Ill be there to earn a fortune from it. As I said I want my millions back.gtgtMy Yolo is designed in a very specific way. Its designed so that even if I am wrong which I am not I will not lose money. Yep its that good. Before I try to explain it to you let me explain this I am . certain AAPL is going to plummet postearnings but as there always is no way for me to know for sure. There is so much market manipulation some banks might keep it from falling more than  just to be able to liquidate their calls at the opening bell etc. For this reason I chose longer expiration options as Apple will most likely keep dropping in the days to follow as more and more people realize Apple is the next Blackberry and start selling their fund. People cant liquidate a B position overnight. Thus I chose the monthly February th expiration. Big manipulators might be able to manipulate the price somewhat but not very long.gtgtI also made my trade voluntarily more complex to account for all possible scenarios more on that later. I have been screwed by big funds before and I have designed this trade so that even if I get screwed I wont lose money.gtgtSo without further ado here is my yologtgtgtgt  I bought  puts twice the amount of  puts  times the amount of  puts  times the amount of  puts and  times of  puts. Those are unbelievably cheap ATM. TOTAL COST  USD.gtgt  To cover the premium paid for those puts I sold a massive amount of  calls. I used the entire premium to buy the puts and the calls below.gtgt  To be allowed to make that trade margin requirement is crazy on naked calls I bought a ton of  calls. This is a vertical spread which allows me to do the trade as I want it. Of course there is no chance AAPL is  after earnings but without those calls I would need a M cushion in margin which I dont have anymore. TOTAL CREDIT  USD.gtgt  All in all this trade has cost me nothing to do  D. Thats right  upfront cost! Free!gtgt  To get the margin required for this trade I had to sell all my longterm stocks and ALL my other plays. Some of the margin is also taken from my Credit card but at this point it doesnt make a difference.gtgtA K YOLO FOR K WSB SUBSCRIBERS! If you want to have fun draw the payout that comes from this strategy.gtgtSo what will happen on earnings? Well simply said IT IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE FOR APPLE TO SPIKE UP POSTEARNINGS. It didnt happen to Google it didnt happen to Western Digital Qualcomm or even Intel or Microsoft ! Yay! despite excellent earnings which Apple wont have. Based on that here are all the possible scenarios that could happen ranked from worst to best along with what would happen to megtgt  The Google Gambit Big funds play the oh they had one below average quarter but they are still growing and they have huge product lines coming yeah right  stock miraculously only drops  like GOOG is  I dont make any money but I dont lose any either. Im pissed off. Likelihoodlt gtgt  The Qualcomm Quack Apple somehow miraculously saves face by playing with inventoriessuppliesdoing Valeant stuff. Then the stock would drop only . I would make a little bit of money. Likelihood gtgt  The we barely got away with that one scenario Apple cheats and starts buying its own iPhones to prevent the number from crumbling too bad. Its a bad quarter but not too bad. Apple crashes to  in AH and then drifts down to . I essentially double my money a  gain. Likelihood gtgt  The last minute wildcard scenario Apple somehow managed to earn more than I thought on some miracle play hedging. Earnings are down by quite a bit. Apple crashes  to  and barely stays above  in the next few trading sessions. I essentially quadruple my money a  gain. Likelihood gtgt  The Back in the Basement Scenario Apple is honest about its terrible quarter and results but downplays it and people somehow buy it. Apple crashes to  in AH and drifts down to  by Feb . I essentially sixtuple my money. A  gain.  Likelihoodgtgt  The Meltdown Scenario Apple is honest about its terrible quarter and investors arent dumb. They mass sell the stock. It crumbles to   in AH and some idiots buy it thinking its a bargain. I make over a million overnight and another  in the days that follow. It crashes to  by Feb .  Likelihood  gtgt  The Hillary Clinton Scenario Its worse than I thought. Tim Cook apologizes and steps down citing personal problems. Apple plummets below  in AH. People panic everyone wants to sell its on the top of every newspapers. It opens at  the next day immediately gaps below  and then spiral down to  where it belongs maybe even lower but lets keep it at that. I more than  fiftytuple my money making .  Likelihood  gtgtSo what is the expected expectancy of that trade? its                          . gtgtHeres a graph with possible payouts. The top column shows the price of apple the leftmost row the gain for each put remember  initial cost  costs are coveredgtgtgtgtUnderstand this Apple WILL drop postearnings. There is absolutely no way whatsoever it can go up. It cant happen. I mean Google is down by quite a bit after its earnings the entire tech sector is down but AAPL somehow stays at . Okay. I am hoping for a massive massive MASSIVE drop obviously. I wouldnt be satisfied with Apple dropping to  for example.gtgtI expect to make close to a million from that trade although there is a lot of possible variance. Obviously I wouldnt be happy with the  scenario as this is my chance and probably my last chance to get my money back. Note that even if apple doesnt go below  my  strike puts will gain in value if Apple drops to  postearnings so I might make a bit more there.gtgtgtgtI want to thank everyone on rwsb for the continued and unending support. You have truly helped me get to where I am and I just want to say that no matter what happens Ill have no regret. You have entertained me during dark times in my life and quite possibly saved me.

10538973,0,t3_5qwy9o,gtI was having a conversation with a coworker earlier this week.  Our company just started offering a matching program for simple IRAs and I asked her if she had signed up for it.  She said that it didnt really understand what it was all about so she was just going to skip it.gtgtI was a little shocked since its a  match Free money! and asked her if she had any retirement savings at all or what her plan was.  The more I talked with her the more stunned I became.  I kept thinking to myself  wow shes so young she could have such a good amount of retirement savings set aside when shes older.  Anyway she had never heard the concept of compound interest so it gave me an idea to build a quick tool to show younger people especially the power of compound interest over time.gtgtHeres what I came up with Compound Interest ToolgtgtShe was blown away at how something like that could grow over time and signed up for our companys match plan on Friday.gtgtAnyway Im hoping this might help some other younger people out there realize the power of saving and starting early.gtgtEDIT Wow some of you guys are hyper savers with fantastic incomes!

When I walked in I saw him on his knees with his shorts and underwear around his ankles putting a toothbrush up his rear end.gtgtI was incredibly shocked and quickly stepped back and closed the door. I apologized to him profusely and told him that I wouldnt tell a soul about what happened sorry little bro I just had to share this story with Reddit. He didnt say anything but I heard him sobbing. He came out about  minutes later and quickly ate his breakfast without making any eye contact with me.gtgtHes been in his room since and is declining any dialogue with me.

10640025,0,t3_5sa32m,gtIve had acne my whole life. I tried everything including prescription acne treatments expensive over the counter facial washes and creams I even changed my diet.gtgtI wash my sheets about once a week but my once I started changing my pillow cases every couple of days  my acne completely disappeared!!! gtgtEdit A lot of people want to know about body ache. Here are my LPT on bodily achegtgtChange your clothes and pajamas EVERY DAY. This includes bras. Also change your bed linens frequently. If you can feel any oily residue on your clothes sheets etc. youve gone way way way too long. gtgtDont wear day clothes into bed. Have separate pajamas for bed wear. If you sleep naked change all your sheets often once a week or less If you sleep with just shorts change your sheets often once a week if you wear clothes you can go up to two weeks but because I spend so much time in bed disabled I change all my sheets every few days.gtgtDO NOT REUSE BRAS WITHOUT WASHING THEM. Its common for women to wear their bras for a few days weeks etc without washing them. This will cause incredible. This used to give me acne all over my chest. Had no idea why.gtgtShower after working out. Always. Change into clean underwear and a clean bra after showering. Never re use a work out bra or workout clothes. gtgtTry to shower every day. You dont have to wash your hair every day and shouldnt just your body. If you are a woman and you hard is hard to manage consider a pixie cut!! gtgtOne more thing about my skin care regimen I quit all that chemical shit. I wash my face with plain old water and since my skin tend to be dry I treat it at night with coconut oil. Thats! I dont use the coconut oil before makeup tho. It messes up the consistency. gtgtI also use pure coconut oil as a makeup remover now. Its AMAZING. Its cheap. I totally discovered it by accident. I had forgotten my  tarte moisturizer on a trip. My ex boyfriend had a jar of coconut oil so I went for it. This stuff is amazing. For me at least. ,Nudelete,dddfqtr,1,t5_38nn9

If you post a comment with another strong point I might add it with credits to you if you are the original author or alternatively to him.gtgt  We are a pattern of organization of a bunch of atoms that by pure environmental circumstances and chance gained conscience it would be astonishing that only because of this awareness we were destined for a greater fate than the other common bunch of atoms.gtgt   We are going to return to our natural state our only real permanent home where we already spent almost an eternity see  before being born nothingness.gtgt   There is no use to invent a helping imaginary friend who will offer you immortality.gtgt   Its absurd to ruin your life a lucky but tiny oasis of awareness that exists between two almost infinite deserts of nothingness by following absurd or immoral rules invented by primitive people of the Bronze Age which have no relation whatsoever with the happiness of other people.gtgt   Face your destiny in the eyes and live proud for having no leach but the one imposed by your fellow human beings organized as a society supposedly for the benefice of all.gtgt   However I dont have anything against a sincere believer. You are my fellow human being who share with me our finite condition. You just found a different erroneous from my perspective way to deal with it.gtgt   The arguments presented were written thinking on the three main monotheist religions and especially Christianism. But most of them apply also to all other religions.gtgt   My goal isnt offending you but just to induce you to question the roots and logic of your faith.gtgt   I also dont really want to convince you to be an atheist but just a skeptical or at least someone with doubts.gtgt   There isnt anything more dangerous for you and for others than you being absolutely certain about something like your religious beliefs.gtgt   Those absolute beliefs can change completely your philosophy Ethics and life goals and not for the good.gtgt   Its when religious people start being fanatics. They know the truth so from my perspective they are literally deadly wrong.gtgt   Its when they are ready to start killing themselves or others for their beliefs or at least persecute people with different beliefs or without religious beliefs.gtgt   As long as you have doubts you can say you are still a religious person but you will be a safer person for yourself and for others.gtgt   In reality you will live this life like if it was the only one you have see point . You will give it more value and will be more tolerant with others.gtgtgt        gtgt God is a human creation.gtgt   All the hundreds of religionssects and their multiple absolute contradictions seem to be plenty evidence that all gods are human creations.gtgt   The same conclusion can be based on the known influences of ancient myths and religions on the current main religions the flood the virgin birth the resurrection after  days Christmas day Sunday day of the Sun the roman god Sol Invictus as the holiday and not the Sabbath etc..gtgt   Gods are just one of the illusions mankind uses in order to be able to deal with the conscience of the inevitability of death. Humans created a god and an afterlife mainly this also stimulate cooperation and obedience because they feel anguish about dying. Freud Thoughts for the times on war and death  Part IIgtgt   Even in the religions that claim to worship the same god the contradictions are overwhelming.gtgt   As you know both Christians and Muslims say they worship the Torahs god Yahweh. Islam says Jesus was an important prophet but not the son of god. And Christians simple reject that Muhammad was a prophet. But the Quran says that its god is the god that sent Abraham Moses and Jesus.gtgt   But Yahweh initially was just a god in the middle of others. Most Jews even during David times about  BC and after kept praying to other gods of the Canaanites Semitic people comprising the Phoenicians the Jews and some other peoples of the Levant.gtgt   There is controversy but Yahweh has been identified with EL the supreme god of the Canaanites that had one or two wives and an extensive number of sons see  Or initially with one of his sons sometimes Baal the confusion was easy because Baal means Lord clearly later the Torah fights this identification by ridiculing Baal sometimes Hadad sometimes a different son.gtgt   In some of the Jewish holy books we can still find several traces of this evolution with references to a council of the gods presided by ELYahweh Psalm  and   Kings  or to different gods Deuteronomy  see a summary in gtgt   Well the Greeks were influenced by the Phoenicians and copied their gods with different names. El was Uranus the father of all gods or sometimes Cronus since some mythology says El was not the original god but rather Elioun that was deposed by his son Cronus. Cronus was deposed by Zeus. The Romans used the same Gods Caelus as Uranus Saturn as Cronus and Jupiter as Zeus.gtgt   So are the believers on the three main religions praying to Uranus Caelus or even to Cronus Saturn?gtgt   But even if they are considered the same god just compare the vengeful and jealous god of the Torah with the loving and forgiven god invented by Jesus.gtgt   The contradictions are so big between them that some scholars like Marcion of Sinope  and christian sects like the Gnostics  even defended that Yahweh the Torahs god was a different god or even the devil.gtgt   Some of the most fracturing religious issues like the socalled divine nature of Jesus or its degree divided drastically Christians and were finally settled by bishops on majority voting under pressure from Constantine to reach an agreement.gtgt   If Constantine as roman emperor was considered divine how could Jesus be less than him? Of course we cant find any evidence on the Gospels for that not even on Johns Gospel but they couldnt care less for this detail.gtgt   Most Christian churches defend the Trinity that the father the son Jesus and the holy ghost are not exactly one and the same but are part of god. But these churches argue that this is perfectly compatible with a monotheism.gtgt   Basically Jesus on the Olive Garden and on the Cross wasnt exactly talking with him self but something similar.gtgt   Ancient Greeks could argue that they also had a father UranusCronusZeus and their sons and parents all part of a divine family. That the difference was of grade and not nature and so that they too were basically monotheists in this flexible sense because they too had a supreme god he just had a bigger family.gtgt   But what all these contradictions but also influences and slow evolution point out is that gods are a human creation.gtgt   With all these different gods and interpretations are all the believers on different religions or sects lying or mistaken but you?gtgtgt    There are fundamental issues about which we still dont know enough but ignorance isnt reason to believe in any god.gtgt   We still dont know what is the ultimate origin of the source of the physical stuff that composes the Universe the quantum fields that created all matter see  on the theory of a Universe from nothing or even the exact mechanism that created life from matter but our ancestors also said that the gods were the creators of thunders and lightening.gtgt   Actually none of the main religions says what was his gods origin.gtgtgt    Religious books are full of immoral rules.gtgt   Some of those are so hideous that they cant seriously be considered the word of a god.gtgt    For instance for I the LORD your God am a jealous God gtpunishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and gtfourth generation of those who hate me. Exodus ..gtgt   This horrible statement is part of the Ten Commandments! And its stated also in Exodus  Deuteronomy  Numbers .gtgt        But we can find even more heinous moral rules A bastard shall gtnot enter into the congregation of the LORD even to his tenth gtgeneration shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD. gtDeuteronomy .gtgt   The examples are innumerable acceptance of genocideextermination of women and children Joshua  Judges  Numbers  killing of babies Isaiah  massive rape Numbers  Deuteronomy  slavery Leviticus  death penalty for the most banal deeds including sexual acts between consenting adults forced marriage Judges  women sacrifice or abuse Judges  isnt clear cruel punishments cannibalism of children Leviticus  burning alive Joshua  stoning etc. sexual discrimination Genesis  Leviticus  etc..gtgt   I confirmed all of these quotes. I didnt copied the actual text to avoid increasing this post too much but I might do that. Even if sometimes there are divergences on translation or interpretation I tried to use clear examples.

There was always issues going with my family and my  uncles partly because my grandfather left a substantial inheritance. My grandma on the other hand was always happy and content i was very close to her and she would always make nice sweets for me everytime i went to her house. I dont think i ever saw her in  bad mood in my  years before she passed away. One day i asked her why she never interfered in the matters going in our family. She replied she tried years ago after my grandfather passed away but the animosity had grown so much between the families that it was hard for them to understand each other.My grandmother gave me the above lpt and i have always stuck by it since than. ,Nudelete,deznp2w,1,t5_38nn9

I also used to grab electrical fences for fun. Im not a smart kid. Turns out I dont have much sensation left in my hands at the time though I hadnt realized just how bad it was. gtgtThe FU I got an internship at the local college for physics and one of the professors loved to do demonstrations. For one of them he put a metal ring around a post ran a current through the post which made a magnetic field and wills shoot the ring in the air. Cool stuff. Now he poses a challenge anyone that can hold the ring on the post for  second gets a Snickers bar. Of course I accept. Now you may know whats gonna happen here but I didnt. My thought process went magnets force hard to hold Ill just hold the post and the ring cant fly off yes? Yes. I was right. But theres a problem. Heat. Keeping that ring there actually required almost no force but the longer it stayed the hotter it got. Now remember my backstory? I got shit  seconds in and smelt burning flesh.
