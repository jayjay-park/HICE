It was the stylists first day and I was her first customer and January  I asked for a trim and she just went to town and gave me some intense short layers and now this one. I do bring photos usually but this time I just said a few layers as it was one length at my collar bone.

565036,0,t1_cg4ga6e,No problem  it has made a huge difference for me. Essentially you want to apply conditioner until your hair is very soft and easy to comb with your fingers it will look like seaweed. Squish in the conditionerwater to form the waves. Dont rise but keep squishingapplying conditioner until your hair is very wet but not dripping wet. Next you can wrap it in an old shirt microfiber turban thingy I got one at target or air dry like that. You can also add curl products to seal in the curls but even without it my hair ends up with tons of waves and curls. Much better than a giant ball of freeze!,Hair,cg4i0q2,2,t5_2qmsf

876063,0,t3_244vs7,I have very long hair so I tell you what I do.  My hair is medium thickness. A couple years ago I decided to try something different so I cut about  inches off to where my hair was at my bra strap.  Ive grown it back out and its now to my waist again where it hits the top of my pants.  I havent used dye in years so its all uncolored hair.  I have much fewer split ends now that all the dye has grown out.  I used to where my hair in a bun pretty much every day and I stopped doing that about a year ago.  Thats also helped reduce spilt ends. Now I just Bobby pin small sections from the front to keep hair out of my face and I still wear buns sometimes but not all day every day. I use Palmers grow treatment when I get out of the shower or a gloss. Make sure you always use some kind of after shower care to seal your hair as  it dries. Avoid products with alcohol.  Dont wash everyday which you already know.  I dont use a hairbrush.  I use a comb to prevent breakage.  The Coconut oil is good.  I try to do an oil treatment at least every  weeks.  I also cut my own hair.  I dont trust salons.  Even when I stress I want a trim they cut more than I wanted so I started doing it myself or having a friend trim it for me.  I trim about an inch every  months.  Hope you find some of this useful!,Hair,ch3v1us,2,t5_2qmsf

935041,0,t3_24oori,Because the weight of your hair being long and because curls tend to soften over time I would go with the smaller barrel. Also once you curl it pin the curl with a metal clip to cool in shape before letting them drop and please always use a thermal protectant. I love Paul Mitchell hot off the press which is a thermal protectant and light hairspray. To keep curls defined loosen at the roots but dont brush out and twirl around bunches of hair to create ringlets or curl families. I really like marcel irons because you can focus the heat on the top and midshaft instead of clamping the tips the area that is already the most porous and damaged and winding it up.

1334461,0,t1_cijifty,As a hair stylist I would like to add when it comes to temporary colors they depth of the color with change depending on how long you leave it on. BUT does not need to need left on for any certain amount of time. Being it is just a stain it does not need processing time.Im so glad is changing it for you. But dont be too hard on her it could have just been a simple communication lapse. Thats why I recommend bringing pictures for your stylist. i.e. of hairstyles you like from all sides front side amp back if applicable images of colors you want if highlights both colors of the blondes and browns that you desire to have achieved during your visit.

1503913,0,t3_2bejne,So just my two cents but I have tried sulfate free co washing as well as shampoo bars.This is the co wash stuff I useAnd this is the shampoo bar line that I usedWith my virgin hair I was able to do the shampoo bars once every  days with an apple cider vinegar rinse and my hair was healthy shiny not greasy and didnt smell. Theres a little bit of an adjustment time where you would have to get your scalp used to washing with shampoo bars but honestly if you were to wash everyday with one of these your hair would let you know how it felt e.g. dried out and squeaky. You learn to let it accumulate the oil it needs to over the next few days. And then suddenly youre not washing every day.As for the co washing I use this now due to the fact that Ive bleached and dyed my hair bright purple. My hair cant take the stripping of natural oils from my head because rather than getting greasy it dries out more nowadays. Again this method takes a little getting used to since its not a lathering kind of situation. You instead just rub the conditionercowash into your hair and scalp and then rinse it out. It feels like there might be some residue but really I think its just the natural oils being distributed to the rest of the hair. These are the things that I do because I was in your exact spot a while back and wanted to treat my hair more nicely. Even down to the headaches because of all the hair that I have. Sorry for the wall of text but these are my thoughts. Hopefully it might help you out.,Hair,cj4sesc,1,t5_2qmsf

The lactic acid the yoghurt may help the cuticle lay flat and the lipids in the egg may coat and penetrate slightly but that is it.More likely traditional south Asians have healthier hair than moden westerners because their hair tends to be medium to coarse ie. strong they dont often use permanent dye they dont often heat style they may cover their hair do not sunbathe they dont overly manipulate their hair just braid and leave penetrating oils are often used such as coconut and sweet almond.Basically what long hair care forums refer to as benign neglect.

3291931,0,t3_2xosz1,Im naturally blonde and dye my hair a very dark brunette too. I dyed my hair darker than normal in October last year then started doing the baking sodaapple cider vinegar thing this January.First of all Ive struggled with very oil hair. I used to shampoo it every other day to keep up with the oil. This challenge got me onto a schedule of still showering every other day because sweat but I only wash it twice a week. Ive switched onto Jason brand shampoo and have been using it instead of the baking sodaapple cider vinegar because Im lazy. Pouring that stuff onto my head actually scares me afraid of getting it in my eyes. My boyfriend has to help me but anyway I probably will go back to using it for one of my two weekly hair washes.Has it affected my hair dye? I think so. Im actually a bit upset my hair is now significantly lighter than the color I dyed it. Just look at this photo from October left and today right. However to be fair I went to a new salon when I dyed it. I can not for certain say they didnt just use crappy hair dye. However it didnt damage my hair or anything it just seems to have lightened the color drastically. So I would say go for it because worst case scenario youll just have to live with a lighter color hair than youre used to.,Hair,cp3i94t,1,t5_2qmsf

A  if your hair is a really light color or a  if its a bit darker.

For the color you want to achieve you could use a demi permanent color which basically is a tinted glaze but will alter your hair color and fade over time. Way less dramatic if you use permanent color too as well to get her on the go. Demi basically coats the hair permanent penetrates and leaves a line of demarcation. Demi is also cost effective. Hair cut depends on whether or not you want a drastic change but thinning out your hair will keep the bush down and maybe getting a stylish sleek bob or think more julianne hough hair cut. Caring for it youll need a flat iron good heat protectant and conditioning serum i use Paul Mitchells Skinny serum or Chis silk infusion.  PS. if using box dye use the  going lighter with box dye will result in godly unwanted brassy tones if its not a shade lighter than your natural level.

You might not have to do very much for it to still look formal.My biggest recommendation as an amateur is NOT try something new for the first time for a big event. Moms advice was to never get a new haircut right before a wedding or event because youre not used to styling it yet. At every opportunity practice doing fun things. If you get ready for work or school in the morning practice doing a new thing.

The mannequin and person shown in the other comment both show a more realistic rat tail that is definitely thinner than Jims and dont have that same poofiness at the bottom. I think to achieve this look you would need to leave a larger area than usual to braid and also have some pretty thick hair.

6267158,0,t3_41e0cv,Do not take prenatals. Men and women need different vitamins. Prenatals contain more folate iron... than regular ones and men dont need a high dose of those and it is possible and fairly easy to overdose on them. Those overdoses arent pretty. If you want to take a vitamin find a good multi or have a blood test and see where you can improve your vitamin intake. Keep in mind that vitamins dont do a thing unless you have low levels or a deficiency and that they only start working after  months of regular use. Even for Biotin there is no real scientific evidence that it helps unless you are deficient Applying them to your hair wont do anything. Some vitamins like zinc can help with skin conditions. If there was a vitamin that could make hair thicker or even make it grow faster youd have heard about it people would be all over it.If you dont know why your hair is thinning visit a dermatologist or doctor. There could be an underlying condition or deficiencyimbalance. Have this tested before you start taking any vitamins as there are vitamins b for example that cant be tested accurately within  in the case of b months of taking a supplement. If baldness runs in your family and you think thats whats happening to you have a look at minoxidil andor talk to a dermatologist about other ways of slowing it down.,Hair,cz208f1,2,t5_2qmsf

Wash your hair once a week and when you do wash it with cold water and a sulfatefree shampoo. In between shampoo sessions use a dry shampoo of your choice. Also the longevity of purple depends on the shade. Redbased purples in my experience tend to hold better than bluebased purples like violet. Do you know which color that purple was? If you are willing to post pictures we could recommend some hair dyes that you could use in the meantime in between salon visits to help refresh the color. ,Hair,d2ujy8e,2,t5_2qmsf

8100276,0,t3_4q3riz,Hairstylist here. I have many clients who have bayalage and swim and  they wear swim caps. Bayalage is lightening we try not to say bleach in the professional world the hair not colouring again we dont say dye.. not into killing things.. bad joke work with me here. With your hair being naturally dark bayalage is the application of lightener painted onto your hair to make it lighter. A toner demi or semi permanent hair colour to adjust the tone will usually be put on the hair to create the caramel look you want. Because your bayalage will not be light blonde level    you wont have to worry much about chlorine messing with the colour especially in a swim cap. Light blondes tend to go green with chlorine but darker tones wont have tonal shifts. That being said you would likely not have any issues however putting on a light conditioner in your hair Id suggest a product called Unite  Seconds leave in conditioner spray concentrating on the midsends of your hair before you put it in the swim cap because its good for your hair in general.  ,Hair,d4qjldi,2,t5_2qmsf

8129497,0,t3_4qkx3t,You could do red or dark brown easily. Unfortunately the roots will be brighter with either of those unless you do lets say a R on the roots and a R on the midshaft to ends. Whatever color you choose make sure the root color is a level darker if you dont the roots will always be lighterbrighter. The roots lifted to blond because it was new growthall natural color and it being right on your scalp. The hair without previous color with left lighter and easier than the part with color. I suggest next time you lift apply to midshaft and ends first then the roots. Or even a low level volume on the roots and a higher on mid to ends. ,Hair,d4ttu3z,3,t5_2qmsf

10064545,0,t1_dbjcgew,Actually if you cut your hair less often you are more likely to get split ends and split ebds will continue to break up the hair shaft making it impossible to get longer hair. Hair grows at an average rate of  to  inch a month or around  cm. So you should be getting trims of about  cm every  to  weeks. That being said you need to show your stylist a visual of the amount you want off because otherwise they may cut off all your growth since the last cut.

I just blow dry my hair particularly around my scalp and leave the ends to air dry then it doesnt get greasy until mid day the next day and by then I can wait to wash it until the following day.

10352316,0,t1_dcg0sl6,If youre willing to style it but dont want to do it every day then maybe you should give dry shampoo a try. Im lazy and used to have long hair that i could add some hair wax to define my curls or throw my hair in a bun if i didnt feel like styling. Anyway i recently cut my hair shoulder length and I DEFINITELY have to style it otherwise it will poof into a frizz ball. I would curlstyle it Sunday and dry shampoo into ThursdayFriday when i have time to wash it and put on a hair mask. I know some people hate the idea of not washing their hair and you definitely dont have to maintain your hair with dry shampoo as long as i do but i figured it couldnt hurt to mention. Go on pinterest find a hair style that best appeals to you show your hair stylist and ask how to style your hair posthaircut. If youre ok with the idea of dry shampoo then great! If not then i guess you can continue to do what youre doing. Keep in mind that all good things provide a bit of effort.Edit Wait. Your hair has a bit of curl but not enough that it would curl.

11026019,0,t3_5xfvn0,I would advice you to buy professional quality products. Drug store brands often have metallic particles that will ruin your hair. Find a Sallys Ulta or buy professional brand products you can use at home.Do your research because this is how people distroy their hair. Hair breakage stained uneven color or a huge color correction bill at a salon. That being said you can still get nice results by doing your own or having someone help you. If you have never done your hair before I would definitely suggest at least getting a friend to help with lightening. Any overlap of product can cause bands or cause the hair to actually split or break. Use a low volume developer and test a strand first. So you know how fast your hair lifts and what color you can get. My favorite brands of vivid hair color are pravanna pulp riot or Redkin city beats. They last longer but also will not stain your hair if you decide to change it to a different color later. ,Hair,dehrw2o,2,t5_2qmsf

11040782,0,t3_5xmuzr,Hey there. This video helped me learn how to French Braid better than any other tutorial ever did. Practice doing one braid until you feel confident enough to do two.In order to Dutch Braid its exactly the same concept as the French Braid except youre going to pull your strands under each other instead of over like you do in French Braids or regular braids.I hope this helps! ,Hair,dejgbp5,3,t5_2qmsf

11114864,0,t3_5yk3pg,I find this works but needs  minutes out of your day every day for  week then take a break for a week and repeat til as long as you need to.Sit with your head between your knees  like your painting your toe nails Rub coconut oil macadamia nut oil olive oil etc. into your scalp and keep rubbing your scalp for  minutes.Wash out maybe have some old newspaper under your head it can get messy! Even if theres no growth results the oils are good for it,Hair,deruzos,1,t5_2qmsf

11275383,0,t3_60xf3m,Hello! After finding a few grey hairs at  I got the shock of my life and think I may try dying my hair for the first time.Being so naturally dark with healthy long hair Im not considering blonde or bleach.

11469478,0,t3_63nenq,Your picture doesnt provide an excellent idea of what shape face you have but Im going to assume its fairly square.  Im not sure if youre a fan of short hair or not but I think something like this would look nice and clean.  Alternatively something like this would like nice too.  Im a sucker for short hair on guys so sorry if thats not what youre looking for.  I think these are excellent choices though.  Keep us updated if you change it drastically.,Hair,dfw25l1,1,t5_2qmsf
