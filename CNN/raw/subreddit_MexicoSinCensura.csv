10769934,0,t1_ddqtmsm,The whole point of the subreddit is to limit censorship I dont like half the shit that gets posted here but I have to allow it as long it doesnt break reddits global rules they had not doxxed anyone until yesterday and half assed btw and I barely saw the post this morning Im surprised none of the other moderators took action they might be scared to do so I know at least one asked me to do it for them because they were scared Im sure you can understand why. I on the other hand did not hesitate to ban them and remove their posts as soon as they broke the rules they hadnt done so on the other posts. I would tell you more but I dont trust alt accounts or alt realities. edit in response to your edit Yes I do believe so.,MexicoSinCensura,ddqu7rm,1,t5_3hbz9
