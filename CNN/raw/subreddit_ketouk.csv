141078,0,t3_1vp6wh,Just watched it on catchup.. Its absolutely no surprise that the professors have been bought off by the big brands. Its obviously a massive industry and the top companies are going to pay millions to protect their investments and future profits. The day the traditional food pyramid is changed is the day Ill be happy but its going to take a lot to push that out of the older generations mind as its been indoctrinated into them their entire lives ,ketouk,ceuhyt7,3,t5_2uedv
160952,0,t3_1vsqr8,My breakfast is ususally a cuppa tea with  ml of single cream in it. Lunch can be  of either eggs or bacon     any comboDinner is usually Meat beef chicken pork lamb with veg asparagus brocoli cauiliflower onion carrot spinach With a cream or cheese sauce. Pro tip for my veg is to fry them in butter. I tend not to worry about vitamins too much but I worry more about counting calories on myfitnesspal.com I love putting salt on my eggs too. tastes sooo good. ,ketouk,cewrkgt,1,t5_2uedv
480741,0,t1_cfu1wc2,Ive not really measured the inout weights about g is lost to the fluid drawn out by the salt and quite a bit of weight to skinribs still tons of bacon left though depends on how thickly you cut it in terms of how long it lasts.My feeling is that its a whole lot cheaper than the supermarket even at the lower price ranges if you compare to the more expensive dry cure streaky at . a pack then its even more of a saving. However for me its really about taste and knowing whats in it and that its not been injected with  of its own weight in water to bulk it out.,ketouk,cfuww3o,1,t5_2uedv
662626,0,t3_21qp1b,Eh you dont really need this for keto as itll just tell you what your blood sugar is durh and for a normal person itll never get that high because your lovely working pancreas will release insulin immediately to lower anything that has carbs in it.Plus for the rest of us diabetic folk we get all this shit free in the UK.,ketouk,cgfl9be,2,t5_2uedv

980689,0,t3_25bqbl,Hey! Been doing this about  weeks so still figuring things out too  I think if you stock up on meat and cheese youre pretty much golden. Berries are good if you need something sweet which I do. Salted peanuts will make sure youre getting enough salt are low carb and really filling. I tend to have them as a morning snack at my desk to tide me over til lunch. Fry ups with plenty of oil either coconut or olive will help with the high fat low carb. For lunches Ive been making a chilli with salad be careful of the carbs in kidney beans can swap out for chopped bacon or something. If you have an insatiable sweet tooth like I do the only thing that will hit it is hartleys jelly pots. If you get the flavoured ones instead of the ones containing fruit they come out at about .g carbs a pot and can stop me snacking in the evening. The other great thing is dark chocolate with a high cocoa percentage. I found the easiest thing was to print the list of allowed foods from the FAQ and just buy the things I personally like. I then go to yummly and search for recipes based on my ingredients. BBC good food is amazing as well. Sorry to bombard those are just my findings so far! Also avoid yoghurt!!! Unless its plain Greek. ,ketouk,chfrgtc,3,t5_2uedv
1036668,0,t1_chm3822,Thanks but this really isnt the answer I was looking for. I have not worked out my macro amounts I have no idea what that is. I have no clue how much protein or calories are in the foods Ive bought Im struggling just to imagine how Im going to make various meals with what Ive bought.I was under the impression that keto was simply about eating more meat and dairy whilst cutting out bread pasta and sugar. This is getting ever more complicated the more I find out about it its really quite demoralising.,ketouk,chm4hdh,2,t5_2uedv

4873210,0,t3_3hn576,I hope its alright to post this as I saw the question about specific UK websites for recipes and I know myself I always struggle finding UK specific products which is why after a year writing halfheartedly about low carb and keto on my blog I decided to turn it around and make it all about Keto in the UK. I made a point to make it UK centric and Ill welcome any kind of feedback  I am trying to get Ukbased brands involved in low carb such as Update buywholefoodsonline and myprotein to see if they can might be interested in offering voucher codes for my readers as well which is always good isnt it?  if on the other hand this is seen as shameless plug please feel free to delete this.,ketouk,cu8t12g,3,t5_2uedv

7638769,0,t1_d3aczww,I just did a rough calculation using MFP and that comes out at around kcals split ...This suggests you arent eating enough which wont help with your tiredness! But then again I have no idea of amont nts of some of your items so that could be where Im out?Personally I would swap out the eggs for either more bacon or some cheese or possibly make yourself some almond flour bread?As for lunch I would drop the fage and berries and introduce something with more fat such as cheese or peanut butter.And then for dinner maybe fattier meat instead of the lean chicken breast and add in some more cheese?This will help bump up your calories and should have you feeling fuller as well as helping with your macros?Well thats what I would do anyway! ,ketouk,d3ahhev,1,t5_2uedv

8303909,0,t3_4t8zjv,Getting one of those meters would be the only way however it is incredibly unnecessary. You only need one if youre type  diabetic and thats the only way you can get one through the NHS. The free way to check for ketones is to see if your breath smells like nail polish remover. However if youre accurately tracking your carbs then you know if youre in ketosis or not. Its like getting a pedometer when youre already tracking how far youre walking with google maps. Its just completely unnecessary. It will not give you any valuable information at all.,ketouk,d5fjnst,1,t5_2uedv
