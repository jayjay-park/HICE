59950,0,t1_cekq52a,Rock When I was  I was convicted of selling marijuana. I bought into the stigma that I was a bad person who needed to pay my debt to society. Yet I found that after doing such  serving my time completing probation and paying my fine  that my punishment was in fact a life sentence. So what started me thinking about policing and the justice system was the fact that I was a victim of the war on drugs ie people. Some might say Im a pissed off pothead but I say Im the creation of a system of oppression. I do see some progress there are many more people filming the police these days but I also see police getting more and more militarized. Sadly I dont believe that the increase of these two thing will lead to anything peaceful. At some point actions will have to join the filming movement. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cel980o,0,t5_2qqdb

There is most certainly people people on BCND that is not going to think outside the box provided by BCND. Yet from my perspective it is far less one dimensional here on BCND than it is on PampS. In fact people will often post stories here that have nothing to do with bad cops only silly mistakes and its usually pointed out. These types of post even become pet peeves of some here.So yes dividing us into polar opposites is one dimensional thinking. Its bad PR its dangerous and it gets people killed in real life. One of the things I do on the street is use certain key words and dress that gets me profiled as a guy who deserves it. Just to see how much the cop will try to teach me a lesson based on nothing. Even good cops rarely have nothing to be proud of in their profiling of people not just races. It destroys people families and communities. Just because a cop thought someone deserved it rather than let the judge do their job even when the cop does nothing explicitly wrong. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cemxtrj,1,t5_2qqdb

The team concluded that the fire was not caused by nor was it intensified by any chemicals present in the teargassing operations. The team noted that the two methods used to deliver the gas were nonincendiary. The pressurized gas delivered through the combat engineering vehicles was sprayed through a nozzle using carbon dioxide as the propellant. The team noted that carbon dioxide would be incapable of igniting and might even have acted as a fire inhibiting agent. The other method   mm Ferret cartridges delivered by an M handheld launcher containing a nonburning nonexplosive liquid agent containing methylene chloride as the carrier  could not have had any incendiary effect either.gtThe arson team likewise concluded that given the multiple simultaneous points of origin the fire could not possibly have been started by a ferret round entering a window and knocking over a container of flammable liquid. Moreover the arson team concluded contrary to a theory that has been advanced by certain people that the fire could not have been started by one of the combat engineering vehicles rupturing a propane container and igniting it. If that had happened according to the report an immediate vapor air explosion or flash fire would have occurred involving the vehicle itself. It did not happen.gtThe arson team also discussed the efforts of the arson detection dog. The dog alerted to the presence of chemical accelerants at numerous points throughout the compound including at the three points of origin. The dog was also exposed to various items of clothing taken from the survivors of the fire and the dog alerted to the presence of chemical accelerants on several pieces of that clothing.gtThe team submitted  samples of fire debris and clothing to which the dog had alerted to a laboratory for chemical analysis. The laboratory items consisted of various items of clothing taken from the survivors as well as debris recovered from the remains of the compound. The laboratory tests found kerosene on Misty Fergusons shoes camp stove fuel on Clive Doyles shoes camp stove fuel and kerosene on Derek Lovelocks clothing and shoes kerosene and gasoline on Graeme Craddocks left shoe and camp stove fuel on Jaime Castillos shoes. From the other items of debris found in the fire the laboratory tests determined the presence of gasoline charcoal lighter fluid kerosene and a heavy petroleum distillate.Oh and also those who escaped testified that the Branch Davidians lit the fires.

Multiple St. John police officers arrived to supervise the students according Lakecentralnews.com Parents on social media were strongly supportive of the issue and the schools reaction. Many applauded the empathy of the students. Principal Robin Tobias reportedly sent an email to parents tonight in which he outlined school policy and what happened today.

In the UK the traffic lights are just on timers we dont have anything like that over here.Well it doesnt change the lights automatically I imagine rather than the green light for cross traffic staying for its normal duration it cuts off the normal timer and goes to yellow straightaway and than the yellow times out into a red as normal. If youre a quarter mile off approaching the intersection that should give you a green by the time you hit it. So if you can start tripping the lights in the direction youre going I imagine it will effectively give you consistent greens and provide a seamless transition for the cross traffic so no issue. If youre oncoming a yellow or something from a half mile off I imagine it could extend the timer for yellow till youve passed keeping cross traffic red.But than again I dont know the full details so its all speculation as to how theyve gotta implement it so that its actually safe otherwise wed be having pileups like you said when the cops rolled through.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,chrefek,1,t5_2qqdb

1336658,0,t1_cijuxu4,I was a paramedic pre and post  so I think I have a pretty good view of what happened.  The cop culture was always abusive and there were always fairly large numbers of veterans so isolating one from the other is going to be tough but really I think the cop culture is the biggest problem.  I think though the recent change is the catalyst.  Actually Im pretty confident that the military has nothing to do with the current behavior of the cops or at best is incidental to it.  Back to the change.  As a paramedic I finished a class on Nuclear Biological and Chemical first response on Sept  .  That was the first time I remember hearing about Bin Laden.  However the agencies dealing with the perceived threats had plenty to deal with that wasnt Islamic.  There wasnt a focal point for anger.  Yet.  After the fall of the Soviet Union America didnt have a focus for its seething hate.  Thats what  gave.  America now had an enemy again.  So fast forward  days and  happens so suddenly everyone is in the antiterror game.  The government has a lot of money.  I took so many classes after  that were honestly a waste of government money.   Classes that I used to have to pay for now became terror preparedness.  They obviously had nothing to do with terror but everyone was getting paid.  I joined the Emergency Preparedness Team and got FEMA trained.  I was now a mass casualty trained paramedic prepared for imminent NBC attack that would never happen.  I knew the effective blast radius of all size of tanker truck and memorized the placards so Id be ready for the day.  I watched a volunteer department that really never even went on calls order a Hummer because their town of  was a terrorist hotbed.  Well they never took out the ambulance but that Hummer was certainly not going to develop square wheels.  Now they needed a terrorism response force.  The local hospital bought a mobile hospital for some ridiculous figure even though there was a real hospital within about  minutes drive anywhere in the state.  Im sure that got looted and then the last pieces dropped in the trash.  The people who bought it now work for the federal government keeping us safe.So now we have paramedics paranoid commando volunteers and the government pouring fuel on the fire.  What happened to the cops?  I think its safe to assume worse things.  In the case of Russian hate the enemy was in Russia but in this case the enemy was a sleeper cell so cops needed to get hostile.  They were the first line of defense.  So take a bad culture with some really bad apples and now crank the paranoia to .  This is what happens.     The cops have been told there is an enemy and they are here.  The cops think they are on a battlefield when they are really in Mayberry.   Heres an example where the cops are monitoring all traffic for radioactivity  Whats the real risk?  Zero.  But what do the cops think?  They are on the front lines of nuketown.  So imagine youre siting in a car all day listening to whatever on the radio watching your radiation detector while reading the latest creative writing piece titled What terrorists will do next what do you think will happen to your head?  Of course the cops are way out of control with toys they ought not have and ideas that shouldnt be considered anything more than fiction but it can be reigned in if the politicians stop with the fear uncertainty and doubt. However are they going to?  Hell no.  Now add in the ever present enemy of the drug user dealer terrorist and that is exactly why we are where we are.  So in summary Im pretty confident that the cops problems are their own making but theyre not fixable at least in this current world.  ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cijznor,3,t5_2qqdb

1385482,0,t1_cipuuyh,Yes. There are several schools of thought e.g. buddhism that advocate for that. Some are for that because it would eliminate blood feuds and cycles of violence. Others are for that because genetics and predispositions whatever caused the parent to be a dumbass might translate to the kids. For yet others if one doesnt deserve life they dont deserve the immortality that comes through progeny. Now that I think about it more they all kinda have the nipping things in the bud kind of thing going on. Anyway I personally think that it is a good way to get at the heart of what is wrong with cops. They do a lot of crooked shit because they think it supports their families biological or cop. I also think that is the only way to truly have justice. It isnt justice to trade my innocent brothers or cousins life for a guilty cop. Justice demands innocence for innocence with interest for the time and hassle and stuff of dispensing it.... So yes absolutely.

I got pulled a long time ago for suspicious activity. The activity that made me suspicious was that I turned around in a parking lot of a closed business after passing the road that I was supposed to turn on. Regardless suspicious activity seldom requires a gun to be drawn to enter an apartment in which the activity is said to be going on. Its the very border of an investigation. If the report requires it then it is no longer suspicious activity its confirmed illegal activity in which the cop has to intervene with a presence that according to hisher best judgement requires a gun to be drawn. Since he had the wrong apartment him barging into your apartment could have led to deadly consequences save a bad night. What would happen if he was trigger happy? What if you or your mother was holding the TV remote and he mistook it for a gun? What if you thought he was a burglar and you protecting your property decided to open fire or attack? You did not mention that he identified himself before coming into the apartment.I would file a complaint against him and the department. Its one thing to not have an apartment number to respond to but it another thing to just barge into apartments that are not involved with weapons hot.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cjeom1r,20,t5_2qqdb

I have not provided a fucking opinion on what they are required by law to do. Except for the opinion that you are fucking retarded.If you dont like the way that Google Etal are required to do things like this submit a bill to congress saying that Google Etal are not legally responsible for shipping illegal content that they find in your packageemail. You see if they find something illegal in your shit and ship it anyways they become complicit in that illegal act.  FedEx doesnt want to get indicted for transporting drugs so they search packages for obvious drugs and occasionally find them and deal with them. This keeps them from legal liability for people shipping drugs through FedEx. Its no different for google. Google doesnt want to be complicit in the transmission of child pornography so they search for hashes and report them. They do this to legally protect their own ass.Dont like it? Make a law about it.

Here are The Onions tips for being an unarmed black teen in America Shy away from dangerous heavily policed areas. Avoid swaggering or any other confident behavior that suggests you are not completely subjugated. Be sure not to pick up any object that could be perceived by a police officer as a firearm such as a cell phone a food item or nothing. Explain in clear and logical terms that you do not enjoy being shot and would prefer that it not happen. Dont let society stereotype you as a petty criminal. Remember that you can be seen as so much more from an armed robbery suspect to a rape suspect to a murder suspect. Try to see it from a police officers point of view You may be unarmed but youre also black. Avoid wearing clothing associated with the gang lifestyle such as shirts and pants. Revel in the fact that by simply existing you exert a threatening presence over the nations police force. Be as polite and straightforward as possible when police officers are kicking the shit out of you.Source The Onion.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cjqz7u3,1,t5_2qqdb

They will isolate him once they had identified his whereabouts then will burn the forest to the ground instead of having a shootout like real men  cops dont do real men thats just for the books and Hollywood but will take the glory once it is accomplish and thats the Anglos way.If for some reason this guy gives up and surrender through his lawyer and managed to survived the ordeal a story of I was sexually molested as a kid by cops and that is why I have this grudge with them ever since might just be some pretty interesting thing to hear. I really dont know any other reason why a white guy would go in a killings of cops considering that many of them have had a get out of jail cards I also understand that some white kids get profiled by some cops and like the minorities they are harassed as a young kid maybe his one of those crackas.What I dont understand why blacks and latinos arent doing what his doing considering they are being  imprison in the masses and killed for no or little reasons at all I dont get it.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ckp5ems,-10,t5_2qqdb

1973512,0,t3_2ha4o5, Different articles tell slightly different anticdotes from the flood wall street protest but I find the interaction and description of events from the demcracynow reports suggest the mass arrest began with Elliot. Seeing his history perhaps theyre trying to highlight him specifically to make him seem like a particularly strong example of leadership in the movement. That is if radical resistance in peaceful ways is your tool and the goal is to motivate public opinion if him in a positive way. The goal being public support for green renewables something even Rockerfeller has now caught on to. Can we sustain the infrastructure without capitalism even if the energy is green? I dont believe so which is why we need a systematic change beyond finding a cure for our fossil fuel addiction.  Article from WSJ mentions Elliot by name ..I do think his story should be shared but let it cause you to think for yourselves.

Unless there was a public anticipation of this decision being made at this particular time I think holding back a couple of days would have been the correct thing to do instead of trying to incite civil unrest.  Why does this publication desire to promote conflict unnecessarily?   Is it to dampen the anticipated protest when the reason not to prosecute is revealed or just to stir up trouble?  Either way I think it is an attempt to manipulate the public opinion. As it stands I hope the ethics committee can do the right thing and I hope the family can bring a civil suit against the department and officer.

Being Caucasian doesnt stop a person from being Asian or African.  How can you not know that and then fix yourself to call someone ignorant?  Caucasian is not a synonym for white its a physical classification for Europeans Middle Eastern people South Asians and North Africans.  Besides that Arabs and Persians dont share culture language or any identity with whites.  Or even skin color most of the time. You classified Indians as Asian but lots of them are also Caucasian.  So are Ethiopians and Eritreans who are African.  Are they white now too?  No obviously.  Being Caucasian doesnt mean anything anymore.  It definitely doesnt mean you are going to get the benefit of white privilege.  Americans are classifying race wrong on the census but nobody cares about that either because it doesnt impact white people in a negative way.  Maybe you were thinking of Caucasoid which is different than Caucasian.  But at any rate it doesnt matter because brown middle eastern people are not remotely the same thing as white people in America or anywhere else regardless of what you call them or regardless of how people try to erase their backgrounds.Chinese Japanese Vietnamese Indian ect. are not the only Asians in the world and dont have the same social status as white people do.You dont know how I framed anything.  Yes bad things happen to white people too.  That doesnt mean that the race issue doesnt exist.  I dont see it as being either pretend race issues dont exist or you dont want to help fix social problems.  The race issue exists.

2499418,0,t1_cmkopzl,This case is appalling but I kind of get it. There is no perfect system somewhere in the grey area lines get drawn.The reason police so vehemently protect their own is because even in cases like this where things look so clear from our perspective they know its just that one perspective. And in our case an internet and media perspective. We all know the ability of media and bias to skew our view. Thats why I cant get super worked up. They have been in that situation a hundred times and know how thin that line is. We tell police that they can use deadly force when in fear for their life. We cant then turn around and say well Im not willing to serve that warrant but you shouldnt have been scared go to jail. No matter how you break this down its subjective. Therefore unless there is overwhelming proof that the specific incident we are looking at was malicious we have to believe the officer when they say that they were honestly in fear of their lives. If a  year old with a gun answered the door and I thought my life was in danger I would shoot first too. It was a horrible tragedy but we should be very careful about deciding who gets to say what legitimate fear is after the fact.There is no perfect system every hard line is drawn in the middle of a grey area. For this reason we should lament the system not the officer. I wish there were a better way that we could magically enact tomorrow but political and social change happen slowly and rightfully so. In the mean time we should treat the people who end up in the grey area with understanding you are likely one public misinterpretation of being tried as much as any of us are.Im a paramedic and I watch the news report on anything remotely medical and its like watching a cartoon. I have to assume the coverage of things I dont know about like this are no better. Therefore Im horrified of what happened heart broken for that teenager but the answer sure isnt setting up a precedence that after the fact the mob of public opinion will be the court that decides if your fear was legitimate. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cmkt8mq,-18,t5_2qqdb

2565768,0,t1_cmt411o,Going to reply here because this is the first post not railing the cop and probably the most accurate portrayal of the video.Yes the situation was a tradegy BUT the cop did not make him leave the vehicle he left himself.the cop did not make him wait out in the cold the cop seemed unwilling to move him until EMTs arrive.  This is a basic of most emergency medical conditions most of them are worsened when moving the victim.the cop was trying to comfort and stay with a victim not harass him.  They were trying to keep him attentive and responsive till help arrived.  This is again a basic  to medical emergencies.   An ambulance is faster than letting them drive to the hospital they would had some relieve for the asthma and they would get him care on site much better.  Even though you see  mins of waiting the hospital was still far enough away even accounting for speeding that letting them go was unlikely going to give them time.  Personally taking him also probably wouldnt have saved much time and again the officer probably didnt want to move the victim.Both the victim and his wife were in no condition to drive either.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cmthg6j,1,t5_2qqdb

2773701,0,t3_2rr1rq,Virtually every prominent incident in this range of problematic killing is tinged by the elephant in the room. Here we see a kind of play that is naive about how threatening someone with a gun looks. The play is a part of something you see in a violent culture jokes and play activity tussling mock behavior etc. around the idea of violence. I see this in many blacks on the city streets. Im constantly turning my head at an apparent scene of a boy hitting a girl only to find that he is play hitting her not really hitting her. And yet the fact that this kind of joke is even on the table for them is in a way a symptom of the fact that in some bigger picture that violence really is on the table. In most of these instances fo unfortunate killings and I realize that many really could have been prevented nevertheless a chief culprit so to speak is the violence of the given culture in which the victim lived. The culture varies it can be ghetto culture it can be in general culture which is certainly violence enough and it is often black culture specifically which plays a governing role in establishing norms and accepted possibilities.The main progressive operation here is to seize every instance like this and attempt to convert it into a football to be played in the football game of fighting straight out bigotry as an extension of something like the civil rights movement. The real issue is this very creation of footballs. Bear in mind this doesnt mean simply turning toward something like black culture only as  point of needed critique police culture and other cultures require the same critique. But something is transformed when this kind of football style activism is called into question and is basically no longer engaged in. We really have to ask just how much we care about our black youth and blacks in general when we turn a blind eye to this continual contribution of violence as a menu item of everyday life. That eye is rendered blind when it is so systematically trained on only some sub elements within given cases such as these when the will to progress always and only seeks to find the best poster child for the cause and when the cause is always and only  yards of progress in a static and unquestioned arena. But this questioning that uses the very word arena that uses this metaphor of a football game is part of something that comes at the problem more thoughtfully. This is the thinking that people do not want to take place and this is the thinking so that can be responsive to the lives buried under these arenas under these drilling operations if you will that drill always and only for the same righteous oil of moral indignation in a game of progress that we are to accept as the one and only arena. To these arenas to these football games I say no.When push comes to shove I think that some people are inclined to just throw the football as hard as they can and demand cooperation. Somehow that lies behind what keeps this general configuration of things in place. I think that it is there that we must refuse. It is not easy but I am certain but those who seek to maintain the status quo and who do so with great force care for less then they would like to admit about so many lives they know so little about about so many who are so vulnerable about anything really other than their capital interests.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cnjcy02,-5,t5_2qqdb

No.The kid starts yelling at the cop to leave him alone. He starts shouting at the cop and telling him to leave him alone. He continues to hold the skateboard.Is it brandishing yet? NoThe cop makes a grab for the skateboard and the kid backs up holding it in both hands like a club.Is it brandishing yet? Yes finally its brandishing.Why wasnt it brandishing the whole time? Prior to the kid holding it as a club the skateboard was just an everyday item. Unlike a gun club or knife there is nothing inherently dangerous about the skateboard at least to others. What if he was holding a banana? Nope doesnt matter what he was yelling at the cop.What if it was a baseball bat? It depends on how the person is holding the bat and the intent. If he just came back from a baseball game and got into an argument even if hes yelling its still not brandishing until he makes some movement to draw attention to the fact he has a baseball bat and might use it offensively. If he jumped out of a car after road rage holding the bat indeed its brandishing.Intent plays a big part here. Cops will use sophistry to twist these things and load up the offenses on a person all the time but typically they get dropped by the prosecutor prior to court.So did the man brandish the snow shovel? Yes but only after the cop made a grab for him. Up until that point there was no brandishing of a weapon which is why the cop didnt demand that he drop the snow shovel.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cnm49oo,1,t5_2qqdb

2801110,0,t3_2s35gx,F RawStory. Check out the piece from KRQE  AlbequerqueFantastic little blurb at the bottomSome readers and viewers have asked about KRQE News s decision to air and publish the name of APD Lt. Greg Brachle who shot fellow officers on Friday during a drug sting that went wrong. Police Chief Gorden Eden and his aides asked News  to withhold Brachles name citing safety reasons. News  believes there is a substantial public interest in publishing the name of a highranking taxpayerpaid police officer who is now the subject of investigations for shooting fellow officers. News  has not aired or published online photographs of him even though we have interviewed Brachle on camera numerous times. Most recently for a story that aired in October  Brachle appeared on camera several times to describe a joint APDfederal drug operation. Neither he nor anyone else at APD raised any concerns at that time. Eden and his aides also asked News  to not air or publish online the names of the two officers injured on Friday citing their work as undercover narcotics officers and the wishes of their families. News  has not aired or published either of their names even though APD named them both in a publicly filed court document.

2859966,0,t1_cnstuzq,There were no grounds to issue a warrant to search for child pornography when it was issued. They were investigating an illegal relationship and wanted a warrant to search the LEOS computer for evidence of that relationship and associated sexual assault.  When the warrant request was made the ADA who wrote up the request copypasted from a different warrant stating they wanted to search for child porn. The judge signed this warrant based on the statements in it and the LEOS computer was seized and searched and child porn was found.  However at trial the defense attorney argued that despite the coincidence of finding child porn on his computer the warrant to search for child porn was issued without any basis to do so so anything found as a result of the search authorized by the improperly granted warrant was suppressed. This is the ADA fucking up as well as the judge who signed the causeless warrant. If the ADA had done their job right and written a warrant request pertinent to the evidence and investigation at hand sexual assault this would not have happened.  The warrant for child porn had no basis to be granted and finding child porn was coincidental. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cnt6gwm,3,t5_2qqdb

Repeatedly announce that he is getting out of the car giving them the upper hand. Come out slowly with his hands to the sky effectively giving himself no time to draw a weapon. Make it very hard to attack the cop with his hands up. If you want to run quickly you put your hands to the side. You dont put them up.

Numbers have gone up and in most cases there is absolutely no consequence when an officer is shown to have used excessive force in any manner. I feel that an officer unholstering and therefore intending to use their gun should be a last resort. I feel that in many situations that are brought to attention via the interwebs unholstering their weapon is completely unnecessary. I feel that two trained police officers should be able to physically subdue an individual with a screwdriverkniferockclub. I feel that if they are not capable of doing so without lethal force then they should not be a police officer. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cpj8ngz,5,t5_2qqdb

Assuming that you are talking about a situation where a cop is abusing his power and not a criminal that is actively shooting at the police or something along those lines I would like to think that my first reaction would be to help stop the killing of the person in some way. Obviously easier said than done. Other than that I would most likely tape it if I had the means. Either way I believe that Americans in general should be fully allowed to record the activity of the police. Also police should have vest recorders that do not have the ability to be turned off. Weve seen WAY too many cases of that lately. If the cops lights get turned on or his gun is drawn it should be turned on automatically.As to your second question... huh?

Meaning even though we are not as free we are much safer and the safety is more valuable than the few lost freedoms.He questions the states legitimacy to a police force and I rebutt that by saying a core tenant of any society there is an acknowledgement of the existence of a mediating and peacekeeping force from Indian chiefs to Asian tribal shaman to our own police force.The police cannot be separated from society.

4181812,0,t1_crwx1mq,At this point the only answer is clear. Not having an actual weapon doesnt matter. Putting your hands up or down doesnt matter. Laying down on the ground has gotten people shot in the back. So just pray you are lucky and dont meet up with a cop who wants to kill you. I still go surfing even though a shark could bite me. The odds are a statistical fluke. So is getting shot by a cop because I am a perceived threat not an actual threat. Doesnt mean I will stay in the water if I see a shark. And I wont let my guard down around cops. Maybe it will take a dozen more unarmed people shot to death by cops who thought they saw a gun before you begin to get skeptical. Maybe a hundred. The guy getting shot in the back by that female cop twice with  seconds between the shots is what red pilled me. And that fake cop who accidentally shot that dude in the back and killed him while the real cop laughed and said fuck your breath as he was dying was also a turning point. Eventually one of these dead people will resonate with you. The body count certainly is not slowing down. How many times are we supposed to believe this infantile South Park he was coming right for me tale before it becomes a joke? I have good vision. I have yet to mistake a cell phone or a hand for a firearm when Im at the range. Really someones hand even if its black does not look like a gun. Try it yourself.

4204155,0,t1_crzfvpn,Lets not mince words here. . If the cop asks nicely and the kid says go fuck you nyugga sure. I am in agreement that this talk of sorts is not appropriate. . The agreement goes out of the window once the cop pulls a gun on compliant kids. Lets ask some questions from the cops right?. Has the blood of both officers been drug tested? If no why? If yes and they find something will the officers be sentenced without any immunity for pulling a weapon on a kid while under the influence? Let it be known that I am in agreement if you want to smoke a little weed or have a little drink while sitting in a car for  hours I am the first to look away and go cops will be cops. But if you pull a weapon while high on either steroiuds crack cocaine or some other highly illegal substance I am toitally for drug testing the blood of the officer with extreme predjeduce amp against his will and if we find something to immediatelly arrestampsentence him . release his service record and his mental health evaluation. Is he a veteran and does he have PTSD? If so has he recieved adequate counslling for it? . release his internal ticket quota. was he behind? did he not gather enough revenue on his tickets for the city? has he had Talks with his seargant about gathering more revenue? Was the departmentr in danger of downsizing? . Since he effectively proved that he missed community relations and deescalation tactics has he been trained in this? Who were his teachers? What were his grades? has he passed the required number of hours?Pulling out a gun is not uncalled for. It would be the same level of uncalled for like a teacher that takes away the miniskirts of students and orders them to walk home like this so they learn to respect the dresscode. Or an old man who goes dont act like a nigga then. Or beating your woman publically. Or beating a kid  yours or someone elses. If we apply If we dont follow the police we deserve to have a gun drawn on us we can also apply If I do not follow the regulatrions on how to be a policeman I will get my immunity revoked and get tried like a normal citizen. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,crzgpio,9,t5_2qqdb

4214519,0,t3_394kag,The cop screaming at the guy to put his hands behind his back while chokeholding him is basically implying a trust exercise If you put your hands behind your back Ill stop choking you and wont kick your defenseless ass once I cuff you. But the cop just gave the guy every reason to not trust him. And that makes his command not just unfair but almost physically impossible for the guy to follow. He has to go against his own hardwired survival instinct to do so. Just as a drowning man will respond in ways that actually increase his chances of drowning as base instincts kicks in and overrides rational thought this man increases his chances of getting shot by wrestling with the cop because hes already too afraid for his life to not fight back.Cops need to understand this and make it easier for arrestees to submit without invoking this fightorflight response.

The conversation was about how having an abundance of guns available to citizens contributes to the vastly higher number of people killed by police in America vs countries without guns because the police never know whether someone will be armed. You insinuated that banning guns doesnt result in decreased violence and that they will still have guns anyway. You gave two counties with a history of violence and access to illegal guns as an example. I then gave examples of two counties that have successfully almost completely eliminated guns and gun violence through bans. And these counties also have almost no people being killed by police.You then talked about unrelated things like population decline. Clearly people not having enough kids has nothing to do with guns or violence or police killings.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cs2zlcz,1,t5_2qqdb

If you took the number that the British have killed in the last  years and multiplied it by five it would be  over  years. What does that change? American police have killed more than  this year alone. The total number dead in the  years in question would be closer to  as a conservative estimate. So then youre looking at  corrected for population vs . See what Im saying. Population correction doesnt make things look much better.

The other  decided to talk to them.  These cops were so dead set on finding drugs that they put the three in cuffs and interrogated them for an hour and a half.      The way they looked afterwards youd think those police officers thought they were terrorists that just planted a bomb somewhere.  Those officers beat the shit out of them.  One of the cops even pulled out his gun and pistol whipped one of them...  Another kid got his face smashed into the concrete.    They thought they were going to talk to reasonable people that had some sort of duty to protect the public but instead they met the police.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ctqnn23,19,t5_2qqdb

I think thats pure shit however the dog could have attacked previously and been attacked by the police dog and thats why they shot it OR the dog could have done nothing wrong and just sat there calmly as his owner or at least a person he knew really well was dragged away.  Before the dog gets shot in the video shes screaming about you didnt have to shoot my dog. I was confused because the dog was still moving at that point.  My thoughts are that theres way more to this story that a video is going to tell us. If they do things properly and file charges Im sure the dash cam caught everything else that isnt in this video. Im not defending anyone here but its kind of ridiculous how everyone assumes shit from things they see.  Id like to just once see a fucking video from the beginning.  Who knows the kid could have had a gun threatened the cops caused physical harm to them or others or maybe the cops are just dicks.

Many states and up here in Canada have put it either into law or into highway law in Canada it is in the criminal code federally which gives police the right to challenge your sobriety whenever you are operating a vehicle vehicle can be a boat even a row boat. Failing to comply can often result in a failtoblow or fail to comply charge. Police do not even need to prove youre impaired or even if youve been driving there are care and control laws which only require the officer to have reasonable suspicion that you may have driven or that you may drive under he influence  charges I have seen include people sleeping in their cars or walking out of a bar with car keys in their pocket.DUI laws are fucked now and there is little sympathy for people charged with DUI. The cows at MADD have managed to cut a large chunk of our freedoms and given police the right to pretty much pull us over whenever they want  because driving is a privaledge given out in the form of a licence issued by the state and very often whether you know if or not when you sign for your licence you are agreeing to be available and to present yourself for a sobriety check at any time.Dont fuck around with DUI checks or DUI stops.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cuvuky6,-2,t5_2qqdb

I have no specific evidence to support the idea that police use of force went down only that claims of excessive force went down. That would mean that cameras are protecting cops but outside of the idea of sacrificial lams Not very many charges have been brought on police as a result of body cameras. Most of the increased indictments came from evidence provided by cell phone video.   Saying that the use of excessive force claims went down is really saying hey these cameras protect police. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cv40tyg,1,t5_2qqdb

5350406,0,t1_cvvd29d,There are rumors she used to date Miles but broke up with him. Miles supposedly was still trying to get back with her and wouldnt leave her alone. According to the rumors Goforth even tried to use his position as an officer to intimidate Miles to make him leave her alone. On the night in question she agreed to meet Miles to talk with him but after awhile received a text from Goforth and told Miles she had to leave.  Miles followed her and saw she met up with Goforth and the rest is history. Not sure if any of this is true but I live very close to the area and a few friends I know who know Miles says he did use to date her in the past. When I first heard the rumor I kind of dismissed it but not entirely because I saw it on FB being discussed in a friends feed. This friend is not prone to believing bullshit but hey who knows. I didnt start thinking it could be true until I saw the same rumor but with the added details in the comments section of the Houston Chronicle reports on his murder when it came out he was meeting her that night. When his shooting was originally reported a woman seen crying over him immediately after he got shot was noted on the news. However they went no further than that and never mentioned her again in any news report until much later. She was basically dropped from the narrative of what happened that night. They didnt say if she was with him at the time of the shooting or someone in the area who just witnessed what happened. No one knew she was involved with Goforth at all until the prosecution had to turn over the information to the defense. They did not want it to come out at all to protect the slain officers reputation. Ive been following this case because I live within walking distance of where it happened and knew an officer was killed before it hit the news. My daughter attends the high school zoned to that area and is in the band. They were on lockdown and could not leave the football stadium to come back to the school because they had no idea where the shooter was at that time. It was said that night that a well dressed woman was crying over his body saying he Miles killed my best friend. I heard about it and thought it was odd that the media never reported that a person who was close with the officer saw him killed. They normally report when friends ampamp family witness the murder of someone they love. Just a small mention of a woman crying over his body that first night with no clarification of who she was to him until it had to come out in court documents. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cvvkopa,5,t5_2qqdb

Magnitude and prevalence have to count for something right? You offered an anecdotegt  I did see parties recently with Israeli Jews watching and cheering while children and their families were being blown into little pieces. They truly seemed to enjoy watching people being killed. Anecdotes are a terrible way to get a picture of the problem. Matthew Shephard was dragged to death by bigots in america but gay marriage is now legal at the federal level. Do you trust the mass surveys or the anecdote to get a picture of what being gay is like in the U.S?Is footage like that posted in this article couched in journalistic integrity? The title says he was shot which isnt shown in the footage or reflected in any of the news articles here. Even if as suggested he was shot with a rubberized bullet or riot control device the title doesnt reflect that. How is that manipulation not propaganda? Can you entrust people who would post such a thing under such conditions? Am I wrong thinking that they are either are blind to the own bias or intentionally posting agit prop under journalistic pretense?gt It is wrong to underestimate the bigotry hate and willingness to kill of many Israeli Jews as it was wrong to underestimate the Nazis.I agree underestimation of a huge problem could be problematic. But so could overestimation no? Is basing your comparison solely off what is arguable the worst atrocity in recorded human history a good way to get a reliable estimate of the problem? There are lots of ways bigotry has manifested itself in human history. Genocide and apartheid and pay gaps and marriage rights are all on the bigotry spectrum but we dont assume that because america incarcerates black men at a much higher rate than white men that they are going to deploy the nuclear option in response to prison reform and if any lasting change is to be made it probably isnt going to happen any quicker when people start comparing each other to the apocalyptically evil right?,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cvxilw3,0,t5_2qqdb

5401976,0,t1_cw23nv4,gt But youre wrong. Black people are accorded the same rights that white people have because we live in a society that values individual rights. Promoting a group agenda that divides us by race will only lead to more injustice and less sympathy for black concerns.Unfortunately the numbers just arent on your side. Since this is BadCop Ill keep this to a discussion on law enforcement although the realities of economic privilege and employment disparities can be equally easily researched.Any honest conversation about BLM has to acknowledge black men being twentyone times more likely to be killed by police than their white counterparts. Were talking about the fact that one in every three black men can expect to go to jail in their lifetime while for white men its one in seventeen. Were talking about the fact that despite black people making up only  of the United States population they make up  of the countrys prison population That despite the fact that white people and black people use drugs at fairly comparable rates and in many cases at a higher rate among white people the latter group is three times more likely to be arrested for drug possession.No one can genuinely deny that people of color are targeted profiled and fucking murdered in the street at a majorly disproportionate rate nor can we gloss over the economic conditions that systematically keep people of color poor. Critics always point to people who want to discuss race as trying to needlessly divide the country. The unfortunate truth is that black people feel they are already experiencing that divide and have their whole lives. And yes as unaccustomed as white people are to being told to shut the hell up for a minute and listen that would be the appropriate response. You really have no frame of reference for what it is to experience the world as a black male and anyone with any actual interest in creating the sugarcoated world you describe where we offer equal rights to all I think would take the time to listen to the experiences stories and concerns of a group who lives a very different life than yours.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cw25ulk,5,t5_2qqdb

5684884,0,t1_cx1311x,You have been downvoted into oblivion but your point is true in a strange way. This sort of thing is often race based because the police can do it to poor black people and get away with it more easily.Here is how policing works. The police are predators plain and simple. The system works when you give them bad people to go after. So if your house is broken into and they can catch the bad guy in the act then you have thrown them fresh meat and they are happy. But if the police are bored then they will find the freshest meat that is within reach. Some guy wearing a  suit is not a good kill because he may very well have the Mayors chief of staff on speed dial and can have your captains head on a platter if you pulled this shit with him. So like any predator they stay away from the other larger predators. Some black guy who works a blue collar job doesnt have anyone powerful on speed dial so have at him. Basically small fry that are an easy snack.Every day people who get speeding tickets and whatnot ask the age old question Didnt you have any real criminals to catch? and the answer is actually if they did they wouldnt be handing out tickets.Part two is the incentives. Often their political masters will have some particular quest that they send the police on and thus the police will be given quotas. Ticket revenue is a very common quest. But it could just as easily be terrorists or bike helmets. So think about the sort of person who qualifies as a predator. This person pretty much has to be a sociopath in order to do this job. Under just the right guidance and just the right environment maybe a good cop could exist. But for the most part this guidance doesnt exist nor the right environment. So you have these predators who basically exist to dish out human misery. Normally they can justify it by saying We kept the streets safe from the scum of the earth. but how do they justify putting a kid who shared some acid with his friend away for a decade or more? That isnt justice that isnt making the world better that is sociopathic clear and simple. So when looking at beatings like this. Dont ask how this can happen. Ask how many times a day does the SFPD do this and get away with it considering that with a tiny tiny handful of exceptions they are a gang of misguided sociopaths with sociopaths telling them what is right and wrong and a sociopathic union ready to back them up when trouble hits.Also ask yourself what these sociopaths are planning for whomever turned over this footage?,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cx1rjm4,1,t5_2qqdb

5699663,0,t1_cx34ui1,gt An obvious inference here is that it is impossible to tell as a citizen not privy to the information in a policemans head if a particular policemans order is lawful or not.This strikes me as insane.  If what constitutes a lawful order isnt determined by the law then the police can pretty much do whatever they want and later claim that they just had a misunderstanding.  Oops!It basically amounts to giving police the power of general warrants.  The whole point of the th Amendment was to prevent this kind of crap.  It also conflicts fundamentally with the rule of law since theres no way for you to know ahead of time by reading the law whether your actions are within the law.

Instead they went right to the firing squad execution because thats easiest and they knew they would get away with it because of the leniency that cops get. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cxnfq82,1,t5_2qqdb

5879757,0,t1_cxq1to9,It may have been bogus from the get go but that is for a court to decide not you. You are simplifying the scenario past the point of meaningful discussion. When I said that life is not so black and white I was referring to the circumstances that surround each case which can completely alter the dynamics at play. Lets say in your scenario the cop who is arresting you legitimately believed you to have committed a crime. In this scenario it turns out he mistook your identity. As he attempts to put handcuffs on you you pull out a gun and shoot the officer killing him because you believed he was impeding your right to liberty. In this case you would be at fault for the death of the officer. Now lets say instead the officer knows you and doesnt like you. So he pulls you over and decides he is going to arrest you for giving him attitude even though youre complying. As he is pulling you out of the car you resist initially by not unbuckling your seatbelt. The officer then hits your head multiple times and pulls his gun on you. You then are able to pull out your gun and fire first killing the officer. In this case the officer would be at fault because the officer used more force than necessary giving you the right to defend yourself. So to answer your question it depends. As an engineer you should know that facts matter and if you make a decision on something without knowing the facts then you are going to get poor results. In both of the scenarios described above had the officer not been killed you would have had the opportunity to defend yourself in court. In all likelihood the charges would be dropped and you would be open to suing for loss of liberty receiving compensation. However the second scenario is the only one in which self defense would be in play where you would be justified in killing the cop.If you are so gungho about comparing apples to oranges then I would say that Switchs actions fall more in line with the second scenario than the first. But that is just based on what I currently know about the case. Again if it turns his driving wasnt really posing much of a threat to other drivers to begin with then my opinion on the matter would change drastically.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,cxqda1e,1,t5_2qqdb

Nearly  hours after his deathOh that is fucking normal...said no ME in the history of the profession. gtHe told investigators including those with the Justice Department that the rigged shower was used on several other inmates with mental illnesses to terrorize them and keep them in lineSo they torture mentally ill people in their care is there anything lower? gtHarold Hempstead an inmateorderly who was in a cell almost directly below the shower told the Miami Herald he heard Rainey screaming for forgiveness.Pleading for forgiveness....these fucks should be dragged behind a truck through a cactus patch. gtOther inmates told the Herald and investigators that they heard corrections officers taunt Rainey as he screamed to be let outAgain more evidence of the psychotic and violent and sadistic people they have in their building. gt corrections officers had no intent to harm Rainey when they kept him in the shower for up to two hours.Who the FUCK believes that?!Accidental death...this is the shit that people go and fucking kill other people over. Just like that father in Kern county beat to death by cops he died of a heart attack...ohh yeah I might have a heart attack too being you know beat to death.

6436430,0,t3_43uqxq,William Melendez has been charged and found guilty by a jury of Assault and misconduct. He is facing anywhere from probation to  years in prison. After being found guilty his bond was revoked and hes been in Wayne County Jail since which is not a fun or clean place to be especially not for a dirty cop am and it hasnt started yet.am judge called probation officer to the stand to ask about what she wrote p.o. doesnt have finished copy of the pre sentencing report so Judge Evans has called a  minute recess to get her a copy. This is admittedly by Judge Evans something different than the usual sentencing I hope hes sweating. Should resume at am.am video froze says will be right back. The judge is just grilling the probation officer about her report and if she feels Floyd Dent deserves restitution after receiving . million from the city of Inkster. pm minute recess the probation officer in summary did no personal research and just took people at their word. The judge grilled her hard then handed questioning over. The second question was were you aware that your integrity would be on trial? the judge took offense then went to recess. pmvideo froze the lawyers for Melendez are using the incompetence of the probation officer as a possible way to adjourn the sentencing offering up amendments theyd like made. However the judge asked the po if shed had changed her recommendation had she known the exact facts and she said no so this may still happen. pmlunch recess til pmpmback on the recordpm Melendez lawyer is pointing out the fact that he did not object to people holding signs and wearing shirts intended to have the judge punish his client. Almost seems to be questioning the victim still. pmMelendez is a father step father and husband. His wife depends on him. Blah blah. Now hes asking the judge to sentence below the guidelines which is unlikely. Attorneys asked to approach the bench. Audio cut off. pmlawyer is asking for probation because hes lost his job income personal business and he will either get hurt or put into solitary to be saved pmMelendez is reading a written statement about how hes served in the military and witnessed horrible crimes against women family and children. Hes claiming hes better than most cops because he didnt quit or transfer to a quieter neighborhood. He claims to be truly sorry to Floyd Dent IF this has caused him any trouble. He also apologized with an IF to the community. But no IF in his apology to his family. pmMelendez is reading a secret  poem called The Final Inspection claims its well known to cops but unknown to the public. He cried of course. pmJudge is pointing out real facts about what the victim dealt with. Pointed out how the Cops celebrated after the beating. She just said nigga lol twice. But that was to discuss text messages sent by the Cops during celebration. Shes getting real. pmJudge is talking about the shitty conditions and pay for Inkster police. pmthis judge is blowing my mind. She needs some recognition. pmShe is calling him out about how the dashcam meant to protect him was what convicted him. Also she compared that night to a game played by police. go into a known drug area find a black guy and do what they do pm months to  years in prison. He will get credit for days starting when his bond was revoked. I cant believe it cut off at the end. She spoke hard but in the end she really cut this dude a break by only giving him  months his guidelines started in the s I believe. pmI just realized my title contains the wrong name.

Its also unethical to put a man in chains for smokinghaving pot this is an unjust law and is basically used at this point as a tool to keep money flowing to corrupt organizations like the private prison system.

Are charges often dropped purely to protect the police from scrutiny?No. DAs have prosecutorial discretion and can decline to pursue any charge. This is unreviewable by a court since it falls within the executives power. There may be a limit if it is selective enforcement. And even then no court can compel a prosecutor to pursue they could only theoretically find another charge selective. This is true for state prosecutions generally. This limit is from equal protection and due process protections from the Constitution. Federal prosecutors may be bound by the Take Care and Nondelegation clauses since the federal executive is charged with taking care to ensure the laws are enforced and the legislature cannot delegate legislative authority to the executive  which could theoretically occur if a law was so vague as to require legislation to enforce. There could be additional state laws constraining a state prosecutors discretion but Im not aware of any. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,d1dhw74,7,t5_2qqdb

7539664,0,t1_d2ymn2k,A cop who would on the spot stop and arrest a police officer for violating someones rights is a good cop.  A cop who wouldnt is a coward.  A cop who would cross the blue line and inform against another officers misconduct is a good cop.  A cop who wouldnt is just as guilty of misconduct.  If a cop whos partner escalates an interaction removes his partner from the interaction and diffuses the situation they are a good cop.  A cop who stands by is just as much an asshole.Being the good cop I described above is not easy I know this but that is what it takes if someone wants to be a good cop.  There was an article recently where the police shot and killed a suspect.  The father of the suspect came out in support of the shooting.  Police applauded the father for seeing the situation for the facts and seeing the situation from the officers perspective.  Now think about this  how do police respond ifwhen one of their own was shot?  How are so many responding to the officers being prosecuted in the Freddy Gray case?  Are they looking at the facts? Are they looking at it from Freddies perspective I realize he is dead but you get my meaning are they looking at it from the perspective of the public they serve?  Good cop or bad cop which one is your brother? Your roommate?  Maybe they are good.  I have no idea.  Its difficult to believe someone close to you like your brother your friend or your partner could ever commit a heinous act or stand by and watch it happen but anyone can.  Even me.

Still the guy had a gun a report came in of a description matching this guy and police were dispatched.Now its clear the shop owner comes out and starts recording well after things had gotten heated and escalated however the other video shows the moments leading up to the shop owners video. What that shows is the police struggling to bring this guy down and trying to get control of him. You can clearly see hes fighting against them and trying to get up.While it is a natural reaction to fight back there also comes a point when you have to realize youre dealing with the cops and resisting arrest can and quite possibly will get you killed. I dont care who you are how right you think you are how wrong you know the cops are or whatever when dealing with the cops DO AS YOURE TOLD AND COOPERATE! If the cops are in the wrong lawyer up once everything is said and done take them to court and watch them struggle to defend themselves there. Otherwise just comply and remember your rights. Dont fight back. Dont resist. Dont talk back. You have the right to remain silent and you should exercise that if the cops are bringing you into custody or detaining you for any reason. I know thats not what people want to hear but you have to remember police officers are putting their lives on the line and they want to come home safe and sound at the end of every shift. As much as some of you might hate to hear this their number one goal is to protect themselves and finish a shift alive. If you think that shouldnt be their number one goal then go join your local police department and see how long you put the lives of others over your own on the off chance that they might not be reaching for a gun or attempting to kill you simply because youre an officer of the law and are upholding said law.Now we do see the guy bring his hands up and start to comply but this is only briefly and you can see the cops on top of him struggling to maintain control. But his hands come back down as the struggle continues and it becomes very hard from both videos to see exactly what his hands are doing.However they told him not to move and he kept moving with hands down by his sides or at least seemingly moving that way. In fact you hear one officer yell Hes got a gun! then the other officer draws on him telling him not to move and yet you can see him still moving and fighting back.The the shots come and of course the cameras look away at what is happening during this time for obvious reasons but multiple shots were fired. When we see the victim on the ground moments later you can see what looks like the hilt of the pistol sticking out of his right front pocket and moments later the second officer easily leans down and pulls it out demonstrating it was easily accessible and wasnt way down in the pocket or a struggle to get out where he couldnt easily get to it.I think thats a pretty objective and unbiased break down of the events. You can see how both sides can see their perspective on the situation and this doesnt seem like a clear cut case of these two officers murdering someone who wasnt a threat or anything. In fact I think the title of this thread is kind of BS because the video doesnt clearly show he didnt try to pull his gun in fact it doesnt really clearly show much of what his hands were doing outside of that brief period where he held them up before bringing them back down while struggling. I know Ill probably get downvoted because this subreddit is all about fuck the police but based on what I saw I didnt see a clear cut case of someone being murdered. I saw someone resist officers while being taken to the ground we have no context for why they did that but apparently the conversation was loud enough to get not one but two people filming right about the same time which says things were getting heated enough to get cameras out and one of them was someone driving by continues to resist on the ground while briefly complying and then is shot during a struggle and has a pistol on his person right where the officers were saying it was.Im all for going after cops who deserve it and abuse their power but I think theres something wrong when we start assuming every cop is bad and in the wrong. When people have knee jerk reactions and start talking about boycotting businesses businesses that had nothing to do with this and other nonsense like that before we have all the facts people stand a chance at protesting and standing up for someone who didnt deserve it and was in wrong.Now Im not saying either party is in the right or wrong here just that people need to be a little more objective and not make assumptions based off partial evidence shaky cell phone footage that cant clearly see the most important aspects and the word of a shop owner that this guy who had a pistol on his person wouldnt pull it on someone despite the fact that a report came in matching this guys description claiming he pulled a weapon on them.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,d52g3gk,26,t5_2qqdb

9822999,0,t1_danjp1j,As it has been said before Jurys are best at judging facts and the courts are best at judging the law.I dont disagree with what you are saying I am taking the position that jury nullification is not a moral act. You have the power to do it and some judges have tried to prosecute jurists for obstruction of justice because of nullification. But none have prevailed so far.I think it creates an adversarial environment in the courtroom between jurists and judges. I argue that this has negatively affected the quality of instructions given to the jury. Often they get incomplete info on the law they are weighing the facts on. If they do any internet searches on the subject they put themselves in jeopardy of being arrested for obstruction of justice.It is an odd thing. We dont have the named right to judge the law but the authorities cannot take that ability away from jurists without tampering with the jury and outcome of the trial.If a person has unrealistic expectations of evidence required to convict the CSI effect is that nullification? I would not think so. Like you mention it is specifically when the jurist disagrees with the law and would unlikely convict anyone of it under any circumstances.

A very loud PA system on our BearCat begins announcing something along the lines of This is the department name Police. We have a valid search warrant for the location.

You are the best person to make personal decisions about your life I should not be making them for you and you should not be making them for me. I know people who have been using heroin for close to  years and no one has a clue they are a drug addict. Is it a fact that Americans want drugs? Lots and lots of drugs? And law enforcement thinks they are going to stop it? LOL the number one cause of death in California prisons is drug overdose. If we cant keep drugs out of our prisons the most controlled existence imaginable how in the world does anyone believe the War on Drugs can do anything but destroy lives more than the drugs do. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,dfciqoe,1,t5_2qqdb

11298379,1,t1_dfcliyu,gtI wanted to ask though  is there a policy that says roll up the windows and stay put until backup arrives? Doesnt that make a little more sense than get out and light him up? Sitting in the car is one of the most dangerous things an officer can do. Bullets easily go through most parts of a vehicle. Most officers work alone and backup can be pretty far away. While its ideal that backup is already with us thats not always possible. ,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,dfcnk9j,-2,t5_2qqdb

11530870,0,t1_dg30nbd,gt See the problem here is that you keep hiding behind legality while Im talking about morality.Ive already said multiple times that I think that the airline handled this poorly and in a morally reprehensible way.  You think that the Uber driver was right to remove the girl because shes being a cunt.  Thankfully being a cunt is subjective and not illegal.  The reason she would be allowed to be removed was not because she was a cunt it is because she is in violation of the contact just like this doctor.gtI must have missed the part where the dude consented to having his head bashed into an armrest and getting dragged out of the plane.Its right under the part where the airline states that they have the right to void your ticket for a number of reasons.  If you no longer have a valid ticket then you are trespassing.  If you are trespassing and refuse to leave after being instructed to numerous times you will be forced to.  How else would you expect the airline to enforce their policy or expect the officers to enforce the law?gtI dont even live in your fuckupass country.Then dont fly United.  Or do.  I dont care.gtAs weve been over multiple times the fact that the ticket is allowed to come with these conditions is the governments failure.Well have to agree to disagree on this one.

11531547,0,t3_64knzf,Obvious question why in gods name would you go to this length and generate the worst possible PR short of kicking an old lady in the face to replace one paying customer with another? Wouldnt the simplest solution be to say to the people not already on the plane that its overbooked were real sorry catch the next one?Theyll be pissed off sure but its a hell of a lot simpler than dragging a man out of a seat he paid for. From an amoral business standpoint it would have been cheaper to literally charter a private jet for the four extra people than to take the hit of customer losses that this is going to result in.

Although the victim made the blunder of tossing down his jacket it was the cop who made the first move. It was so sudden that the victim had a clearly delayed reaction as he didnt immediately fight back. In fact the victim didnt throw a punch until several seconds into the pummeling. At that point his brain was probably mixed with a cocktail of haze brought about being hit in the face repeatedly adrenaline pain and overall his brain saying YOU ARE BEING KILLED DO SOMETHING.In a fair court system itd go to the victim hands down.,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,dg4r3qa,16,t5_2qqdb

At a glance you might think that means you can be charged for not identifying yourself to a peace officer. The body of the text actually says it is only applicable after you have been lawfully arrested.
