4522874,0,t1_ct0qunk,Sounds good. If you can illustrate how Nova has broken these agreements in the past it is possible to refuse to negotiate with her since she and Kaiserin probably wont uphold any treaty arising from negotiations anyways.,CivGNA,ct0qy7k,8,t5_377a6

6219360,0,t1_cywkih7,I think you tended to blow things up like voting. Im not saying issues did not exist but I literally tried my hardest to accommodate towards people who had issues.By the time the constitution was amended to give the senate literally all the power people still said that was not enough.I did not mean to make it sound like it was just you it was others too and I know there were issues.,CivGNA,cywko85,0,t5_377a6
