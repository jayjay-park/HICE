But Im in my off the hill job because I stuck out a hillternship for way too fucking long loved the office I was just being shitty about networking. I got it because my office appreciated my work and out the blue sky passed along an opening for something off the hill. Just keep getting coffee with people from every office you can outside of yours make sure your staffers like you and eventually they will pass along an off the hill job. ,DCJobs,d7zb0ng,1,t5_2s9hp
