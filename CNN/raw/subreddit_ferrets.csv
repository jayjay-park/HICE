55825,0,t3_1uqfh4,My suggestion is a squeaky toy. My Poco absolutely LOVES his squeaky chicken while Shinchi could really care less about it but when you squeak it for the first couple of times he looks for it. Once he figures out what it is hes on to more interesting things. Most ferrets cant resist the sound of a squeaky toy and most are able to be called with the toy if you cant find them. Shinchi just usually comes to his name but Poco is little mister have it his way so the only way to call him is with the squeaky toy.,ferrets,ceksajb,2,t5_2qhn1
73934,0,t1_cems5pn,Aww. I am so sorry to hear that! My ferrets are decently behaved. I have always been on them with training and showing dominance scruffing and dragging. So I think they have a certain type of respect for me and they feel safe. Now that does not mean they do not try to get out! lol I do not put that much water into the tub and I make the water a little bit warmer than lukewarm. I think with the  of them in there all together  it eases the anxiety a little as well. When I take them out I put them all into  carrier with  or  towels and let them bug out in there for a few minutes then I will hold up my hair dryer to the carrier and dry them as I give them some ferret lax or even ferretvite. Once I dry them and let them out they are happy as clams. ,ferrets,cemuhp3,2,t5_2qhn1

98236,0,t3_1v7esh,Its not necessarily a death sentence. Lymph nodes will swell if the body is fighting off infection. The lymph nodes are where the body tries to send invaders to quarantine and fight. The concern comes if the nodes are swollen for a long period of time say  weeks or more without any sign of decreasing in size.There are a few things that can be done when there is concern A set of blood and urine tests to see if there is any kind of infection. This also checks for any unusually high lymphocite counts or can detect any possible nutritional issues anemia blood sugar etc. A lymph node biopsy which can either be a core sample stick a needle in a node to take a small sample which may need to be done a couple of times to get a good indication because its a small needle or a removal of a lymph node to do a full biopsy on it to detect carcinoma.When I was concerned I went as far as a core sample. Nothing was detected either time. I didnt do a full removal because I didnt want to put him under that much stress. So instead my doctor had me do an antibiotic and steroid regimen with him. After the regimen his nodes went back to normal and havent increased since  months ago. HOWEVER doing this regimen means that you will not be able to do the full biopsy for a number of months because the steroids will compromise the results.Blood and urinalysis should not be expensive. Maybe a little over  for both combined or a little higher if they want to consider it exotic treatment and jack up the price. The medicine regimen is  .,ferrets,cepm42f,3,t5_2qhn1

He was walking a bit strange then laid down on the floor with his front foot under him at a weird angle weird for a ferret. He then pooped on him self and wanst responding to me touching him or talking to him but his eyes were open. He also didnt try to take nutrigel. This lasted about  minutes which was the time it took me to call the vet then as i hung up he started walking and responding again. The vet didnt comment on the severity but he was moving and responding and only appeared to have very slight weakness in his back legs. We were told to monitor him and make sure he was eating and drinking and offer him nutrigel a few times a day over the weekend. We were told if there was no improvement to bring him back in Monday.,ferrets,codwhu6,2,t5_2qhn1

3468580,0,t3_2zysa2,I had a female that bit. The biggest part of breaking her was being confident when handling her. She acted on my fear.Remember when you put her in time out not to use her regular cage youve gotta have a jail.  minutes. If she causes ruckus or bites the door start the timer over. Then just open the door let her sulk out dont go to her.Eventually that attention turned to positive play and attention but she had to be trained for everyone she met so most people never got to hold her. Idk if it would have changed with age because she was killed pretty soon after that but choice friends and I were able to freely handle her.Good luck man.,ferrets,cpnn5x6,3,t5_2qhn1
3593245,0,t1_cq1nqg1,Awesome! Im glad to hear hes feeling better. If you are looking to avoid blockages in the future try these. Feed him a raw egg  times a week. My ferrets love when we whisk it and put it on a small plate. The egg helps with digestive health.. Buy a product called Poopin Pumpkin. Its a fine pumpkin powder that you can add to the egg that will help clear out blockages.. Find a salmon oil product that only contains the oil. It will help break down any blockages that might start to accumulate. Its also super helpful for nail clipping. Just put a few drops on their belly and theyll be too busy licking it to notice you clipped their nails.These arent homeopathic recipes. These are actual working remedies. I recommend checking them out as I know how scary a blockage can be. You guys did really great for your little guy!,ferrets,cq1uv1r,2,t5_2qhn1

3607757,0,t3_30tnd0,Biting We got our ferret to stop biting by making a yelping noise or yell OUCH when she would bite. This worked pretty well for us. Ive read on other threads in rferrets sorry too lazy to find the link but search biting on here you will find a handful of posts about this that if you put olive oil on one hand hold them in the crook of your other arm and let them sniff lick off the oil it helps them associate your hand with treats and they will bite less.. Never tried this with mine since the yelping worked with her.Another effective method Ive read about is nipping them back. This sounds TERRIBLE but use your best judgement. We had a pet bunny that was a nibbler and my boyfriend carefully bit down on his ear until it caused discomfort bunny started wigglingtrying to get away bunny never bit anyone again. I know this sounds AWFUL but I have read about people using this method in other rferrets threads.Potty training Sorry no advice about the litter box  ours is almost  and just recently we had to put two extra litter boxes in her cage. She poops all over it if there are not  separate options. We try making sure she poops before she comes out for playtime which does help significantly. Sometimes we cant coincide playtime with her having to potty so this is something that isnt always possible.Age Yes part of this is just because he is young! Lucy was about a year old before she even got mediocre at using her litterbox. She is ok now but still poops outside of the cage from time to time. Some weeks shes got a perfect in the cage record. Other times its like  in the cage  in a sneaky corner.Toys How many toys do you have for him? Does he like to stash or dig? Mine LOVES hiding toys all over her favorite are fluffy ones. Dog toys cat toys baby toys random styrofoam tubes and plastic grocery bags are Lucys top favorites. She needs more she has about  things to stash at the moment. I cant get her to use a dig box but that might help yours stay entertained. It might keep him out from under the couch for a little while! I hope some of this helps good luck with your fuzzbutt!!,ferrets,cq3idtr,1,t5_2qhn1

4141767,0,t1_crsb4t8,Thanks so much for addressing everything! I have to say Im jealous that your ferret sleeps with you guys  mine loves finding little hideaways to sleep in behind the bookshelf inside cardboard boxes etc. but if we pick him up while hes sleeping and put him on our lap he usually falls right back asleep. He has to be really tired though otherwise hell get up and go back to a secluded spot  Im hopeful that one day hell come to us for snuggles on his own! But again thats part of the reason I dont want another ferret to disrupt his bonding progress lol. Thats a really good point about them unlitter training each other. It was SO frustrating getting ours to use the litter box outside of the cage in the beginning. I can only imagine how much of a headache it would be to have to retrain  of them! Though Ive also read that sometimes it works the other way around and the litter trained ones teach the new guys to use the litter box so I guess it really can go both ways.,ferrets,crsdni5,1,t5_2qhn1

4500729,0,t1_csx1ms3,Post Vet Update The alternate vet was able to see Faye today. She was still not quite herself this morning and through out the day while we waited on the vet. Luckily her blood work came back great! The vet did a physical exam as well and what ever it was last night seems to have passed for now.  He does not believe it to be insulinoma at this point but he did agree that all the symptoms pointed to low blood sugar at the least last night and before he got the blood panel back he was pretty worried that it wan insulinoma. He was adorably happy that it was not as such I feel like he has to tell ferrants bad news too often and was stupid happy to not have to this time. For now we are to closely watch and make sure she eats and drinks properly as the rough play plus not eating properly may have been the trigger. They will call in a couple of days to check in. I think I may switch to this vet. I really liked everyone I interacted with there and they seemed very knowledgeable on ferrets!!

No need to put treats or anything in there as you dont want to risk him eating whatever digging substance you choose. Try burying his favorite toys inside of it partially he will do the rest.As for the scruffing yes it will work in time. My little fuzz took a couple of weeks to learn that biting is not okay its just a matter of consistence and patience. The scruff doesnt need to be mean or hard in any way just a gently short scruff should do fine so that he knows who is in charge! Hold him in the scruff until he yawns about  or  seconds and let him go. It wont hurt him as long as you are gentle and help support his wait a bit until you set him down. ,ferrets,cwkbc8y,3,t5_2qhn1

He will nibble and scratch you when having fun but never enough for it to hurt.Cortana is nice but a bit of a loner. She doesnt like being picked up or held but she has never bit or scratched anyone either. Shes pretty lazy but when you play with her she does anything she can to run and hide.Tifa I always joke as being my favorite because she has a weird special bond with me. She bites everyone extremely hard too but never hurts me at all. Shell lick me and cuddle me to death but doesnt want anyone else near her. Shes not a big fan of playing or running but she loves to steal everything I own and hide it from me.Its just insane how different they all are.,ferrets,cwngwel,2,t5_2qhn1

5627068,0,t3_3s5nxo,Hi OP We have  ferrets all of different ages personalities and types. We have one the youngest who is a notorious nipper. The other  have been completely trained out of it and aside from when they get seriously excited dont ever bite. They do mouth when playing however Im assuming this is not what your ferret is doing. Im guessing he is scratching with his teeth and making marks. Now our youngest is almost . He still nips gets scruffed on the daily and is like the freakin energizer bunny. We have owned him for  and  years. So thats amp years of scruffing time outs and when he really chomps down pushing back into his bite or a gag. He is never gonna change. He will always nip he always gets too excited and we have just learned to adapt. Im not saying your ferrets will also be like this always but its just context. All ferrets are different. My best advice would be to keep doing what youre doing dont change it but most importantly be consistent. There is no point in letting your baby ferret away with nipping you while you play and then scolding him for nipping others. Even if you think oh I dont mind the occasional nip it will be extremely confusing and frustrating for your ferret if he only gets corrected sometimes. If you dont mind your ferret nipping you thats entirely your call but just warn others that this can happen and that ferret teeth are SHARP!! Especially baby teeth. When they get to about  years old it hardly even bothers when a ferret nips you as their teeth have rounded off a bit due to wear and tear. weeks I hate to tell you is not a long time at all. Your ferret is still very much a baby he is all ruff and tumble and spit and nails and fite me!! big hooman fite me!!!!. Thats how ferrets are. Their method of play and establishing social hierarchy is to fight. A ferrets only weapon is their teeth. So they will use them. They are also fearless!!! Super fearless! So when theyre having fun and thinking the game is turning serious they WILL challenge you. I have spent  solid minutes sitting on the floor scruffing and rescruffing our youngest cause he decided he was taking me on that day. You just have to keep doing it until they walk away. It will get less and less over time. Im not sure who it is youre having interact with your ferret but I wouldnt let ANYONE play with my ferrets the way I do because its just irresponsible of me to. They are not ferret owners they have not invested any time in raising and playing with my ferrets. They dont know what they will be thinking or any of the like. I have friends that come and play with my ferrets but it involves them throwing toys that my ferrets chase after and bring back yes two of them play fetch. This avoids any possible handteeth interaction. Most of the time when people are meeting my ferrets it is in a very chill lets all hang out and eat treats and watch them play with each other kind of manner. There is hardly any handling involved. If it comes to kids then no way am I letting the ferrets get excited and wound up by play fightingwrestling because they can still accidentally bite me sometimes. I would feel awful if they bit a kid. Try not to think of your ferret like a cat or a dog theyre not like them at all. People kind of know from observing others how to interact with a cat or a dog.  of people are clueless when it comes to interacting with animals they have hardly any experience with. Think of it like this you see a toddler walk up to a dog and yank on its tails or try pull its ears. Everyone pretty much knows this is bad and will result in the kid getting bit. Dont think very many people will understand that if you roll a ferret over on its back and tickle its belly that it see that as the start of play fighting. Why would they some dogs and cats love belly rubs dont they?  Anyway I feel like this is getting a bit long winded and I think Ive covered most things! Last thing I would like to add is please get your fuzzbutt a friend lt they are very social animals and shouldnt be kept alone ,ferrets,cwulaxi,3,t5_2qhn1

I buy him bedding because Im currently out a washer and dryer so its easier for me to just change bedding. it cost me about  for a gigantic bag that lasted a couple months. I have people telling me all the time that you shouldnt buy regular dusty cat litter because it screws with their respiratory system but my guy doesnt dig and hes been fine. I can get a five pound bag of it for like  . at walmart. I also get shit because I have a large rabbit cage for him which isnt enough room but Im home all day so he is out of it for all but a couple of hours while I sleep. I think the cage cost . I paid  for him but he was already neutered had his glands removed and was up to date with his shots whenever I bought him. after the initial cost of buying one or however many the cage toys bedding and food theyre not too expensive to care for!other than being hella defiant and using my feet as chew toys I would say that he is by far the favorite pet Ive owned.,ferrets,d8ru8tl,2,t5_2qhn1

10508393,0,t1_dcyzdw5,I adopted all of mine as young adults and although I want the experience of having a kit I wouldnt swap my lot for the world. All ferrets need good homes and I cant fathom ever buying a from a pet shop knowing how they are or may potentially have been bred. For anybody reading this please try and adopt. They are just as fun loving and wonderful as the babies are I promise. They are in need of good homes and if you can provide one then youre doing your best to give an animal a much better chance at life as well as buying into a living being rather than a product.,ferrets,dcz8kbg,2,t5_2qhn1
10525397,0,t3_5qmb7u,I worked at petco for a little over  years and from my understanding if you are moving to California and have a ferret you are able to keep it as a pet and bring it to the state. I had many customers drive from California to come buy ferrets and a majority of those customers said California has several ferret rescue groups where you can adopt a ferret but the adoption fee is like  to  dollars. They would drive back to California with the ferret and I would see them from time to time and they said they had no problem getting to California with the ferret. The insight I got from all the customers was that it was illegal to buy ferrets in the state of California but if you were adopting or moving into the state with ferrets then that was legal. Again this was all said from people who lived there and were coming to Arizona to buy ferrets to take back home. A good precaution is to go to your vet and get a health certificate for traveling so if you get stopped they know the ferret is healthy going into the state. ,ferrets,dd162f4,2,t5_2qhn1
10547280,0,t1_dd3ll97,I used to try harder an hour or two per day but after  five years of playing with them and trying to get them to cuddle Ive sort of given up. Now I only really truly interact with them  minutes a day and they seem to have the exact same attitude towards me. I let them play in our massive basement give them tons of toys fresh food and water and clean up after them. They have each other to snuggle every day. Seems like they dont need me for companionship so it never happened. One of them seems to like me and asks to play and be picked up but then squirms to get down after a minute or so but the other just sort of lives in my house. That one has Waardenburg though so that may be part of it. ,ferrets,dd3nhh4,1,t5_2qhn1
10548544,0,t3_5qya1w,You should probably return them. Ferrets are not easy to take care off they should get at least  hours outside of their cage. They will destroy your furniture poop in all corners of your house and get into everything they can cupboards bags drawers ie everything. They live by their own rules. Definitely not for everyone they require a strong handler and a lot of patience. But to most ferret owners they are entirely worth it. You might want to try getting a hamster having a ferret is akin to having a  year old child.,ferrets,dd3snd9,2,t5_2qhn1

They are pretty big for a treat but I just cut them in quarters first. Not the healthiest snack but good for their teeth and they go nuts for them.,ferrets,ddckrbu,5,t5_2qhn1

11573036,0,t1_dg7sruc,Haha OK did I ever say I stomped on the ferret? No it was very lightly stepped on not by me which was an accident because accidents can happen. I may have worded it wrong but not once has she escaped she comes outside with me multiple times a day and she never runs off and if she does leave my side its to go back to the door to go inside. We had the after effects of cyclone Debbie which devastated qld my door was actually locked and blew open while I wasnt home. I came home to a missing ferret and I didnt stop searching for her for  hours and did absolutely everything I could to get her back. Willful animal neglect and abuse is just ridiculous and actually makes me laugh. I love my animals more than anything and they are treated so well. An unfortunate incident happened and this happened I didnt chuck her outside for a week and make something bite her tail off ,ferrets,dg7t5qm,0,t5_2qhn1
