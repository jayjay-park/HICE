In all the time Ive been here Ive never used multireddits and so I have to admit that Ive never explored the multireddit functionality of this app. I went ahead and made a few singlesubreddit multireddits and this will work for my needs. So thank you for that. However since this is more of a workaround Ill still advocate for the bookmark feature. I think that it would be more intuitive and faster if implemented properly. A good case in point would be my experience of not coming up with your idea whereas if there was a star symbol on the top a subreddit page for example then it would be hard to miss. ,redditisfun,d07ke81,1,t5_2rfi7

Is it happening on the same albums or does it seem to just happen with albums randomly?I just went through the first  or so imgur albums in rmechanicalkeyboards that I saw and didnt have any issues myself...ampnbspNot sure if it is the same thing behind your issue but there is a known Android System WebView bug thats been affecting some users though the problem just causes albums not to load but I dont know that Ive heard of it causing the application to crash. I believe that it has been fixed but its just a matter of waiting on Google to push out the update. ampnbspIn the meantime you could also try and set RiF to open Imgur links with the external browser SettingsgtBrowsergtExternal Browser Rules and add a rule for imgur.com and tell Android to open Imgur links with the Imgur app. Not quite as fast as the builtin RiF browser but should still be faster than opening it in Chrome.And according to udeftdrummer what has also worked for others is to go into the Android System Settings menu go to the Apps menu find the Android System WebView in the list and then uninstall all of the updates for the app if there isnt a button for it then the option might be under the threedot menu. Youll also want to go into the Google Play Store app and set the Android System WebView to not autoupdate.  ,redditisfun,d0jg5jo,5,t5_2rfi7

Do you know if the issue is happening with both Imgur and GyfCat gifvs? Can you test this to verify its happening with gifvs from both sites?. What are you using to save the file?

7909987,0,t3_4nm4pk,Didnt wanna make another post for this but when minimizing the app then returning it reloads the built in browser every single time. I was browsing a big rDIY album on imgur  pictures daily data limit of mb which of course that used up a pretty good bit of to load and I had received a text so I clicked the notification responded and when I came back it reloaded the page so I decided to just not view that album didnt have the data for it even though I already loaded it.From then on Ive noticed that it does it anytime I leave the app.,redditisfun,d455odo,1,t5_2rfi7

9002960,0,t1_d7tw4rq,Aw. I was hoping this might qualify as a security fix since itd be moving to a more secure method.Like I said neither of my replacements is viable. One wont install now giving error  which I cant find anything about and the other like I said crashes if theres new mail as well as other times.If it helps at all the app that still lets me post is called Flow for Reddit ... They arent lying about it being a preBeta. Its also apparently abandoned and is running into other troubles. Posting works but the frontpage can be blank. ,redditisfun,d7u0l9l,1,t5_2rfi7

9559344,0,t3_5buj3v,There are a number of people who report having issues with GfyCat but it doesnt seem like its tied to phone hardware or manufacturer or any other obvious similarities or connections.It shouldnt be due to the video playback itself because it uses the same MPWEBM video codecformat that Imgurs GIFV uses... so if one plays the other should play without any issues as well. The only other possibility then would have to be related to the network connection between your phone and the GfyCat API servers... which narrows it down to about a dozen different things. My current hypothesis is that its regionally related and maybe GfyCat just doesnt have very good server infrastructure outside the US or with certain carrierISP networks but Im hesitant to ask people about revealing any personal information like their country and ISPcarrier so I dont really have enough data points to really support this. ,redditisfun,d9rdvvs,3,t5_2rfi7

9693031,0,t1_da7upfd,gtIt is still doing it so it had nothing to do with the official Reddit app. It isnt an active conflict its one thats triggered when the app is installed and registers the intent filters with Android telling it what links its capable of opening in the app. gtI never leave the app if that info helps. So the link is opening in the internal RiF browser? Yes this info helps a lot!Just to check all np links do this? Because I know that improperly formatted np links www.np.reddit.com for example wont work properly with RiF. I assume this isnt the case but just want to rule that out. gtDont know about op but I havent updated in a while on version .. if thats also needed.It definitely sounds like an issue with RiFs intent filters getting messed up. My suggestion is to uninstall RiF and then reinstall it which should kill two birds with one stone reregistering its intents with Android and updating you to the latest version. ,redditisfun,da7vecg,1,t5_2rfi7
