3663261,0,t1_cq9ruqg,I bought a clone from FastTech and have more or less the same experience. I only find it to be good not great with a chuff cap. I do not like it at all with a standard drip tip for the builds I use. Downside is that the AFC doesnt fit a chuff without a gap forcing you to get rid of that sleeve entirely and only use the smaller airflow holes. Its still a good amount of airflow but not ideal as it is fixed. Also it leaks like crazy.  Overall Id say it sees more use than about half my RDAs but its not one of my favorites. ,Cloud_Chasers,cq9u4p4,2,t5_33pi3

4238772,0,t1_cs2iipa,Thanks for your feedback. What gauge wire did you use and how many wraps? After doing the nanocoil at g  wraps I wanted to test it to make sure it wasnt hotspotting but I forgot my sig was set to w. The poor coil immediately melted off the post and I had to start from scratch ,Cloud_Chasers,cs3eucs,1,t5_33pi3
4252623,0,t1_cs4yzks,I do like your videos.A thought on newbie builds I usually will build my friends either a g  wrap on .mm dual or for the more advanced a  wrap g on .mm dual parallel coil. I always try to preach surface area over low resistance to those who are new. Those builds produce hilarious amounts of vapor for being relatively safe resistance.,Cloud_Chasers,cs4zisz,1,t5_33pi3

7207666,0,t1_d1xc5xj,LG HG batteries are some of the best available right now outside of LG s and VTC s for mech mods especially with just a single battery.LG HG batteries have an effective continuous discharge of A and a massive  mAh. Thats better than Sony VTC batteries which have an effective continuous discharge of A with a slightly lower  mAh battery life. Though the max safe continuous discharge on VTC batteries is higher at A the batteries will receive some damage if continuously fired at that current howeverThe only better batteries out there for the most part are the LG s which have half the battery life as a trade off for their massive A effective continuous discharge.I source my battery ratings from this link its the most frequently updated and most accurate analysis of batteries available currently.,Cloud_Chasers,d1xgdgb,1,t5_33pi3
