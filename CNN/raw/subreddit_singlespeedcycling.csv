Depends on lot of factors though including the quality of the mechanism what was used to lubricate it originally time in use.  Just way to many variables.But near freezing?,singlespeedcycling,cgfn9dv,2,t5_2ux37
998982,0,t1_chhoy1f,Well if you want a seven speed bike and it is in good condition its a good deal. Was originally about  CAD in its native Denmark. The big downside is that it is danish and looks to have some odd custom parts those disk brakes are very strange that may make maintenance a bit of a problem. It also might be on the heavy side but it isnt easy to find specs on it.I say go for it if you dont like it it is highly unlikely you will lose money on the deal if you resell it. ,singlespeedcycling,chhubgd,2,t5_2ux37
