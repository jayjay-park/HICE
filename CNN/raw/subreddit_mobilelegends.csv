9937226,0,t3_5ht0x8,Burst is when you blow everything to kill something as soon as possible. Generally something done by mages and assassins. Although not limited to them. Poke is when you deal damage to the enemy not to kill but just to weaken. The idea is to get them low enough from poking to be able to finish them off by bursting them down. Preferably without taking damage back. But this is not always avoidable. In those cases try to deal more to the enemy than they do to you. This is called trading. ,mobilelegends,db2ugn7,1,t5_3gvmo

In other words if you want to keep  in the subsequent matches you have to keep  instead of merely a This also works in the opposite way if you have a  win rate one win and one loss will make you increase your win rate because it will make it converge to ,mobilelegends,deoafau,2,t5_3gvmo

The playstyle doe is really tricky and takes alot of practise. Now lets back to the Natalia situation. Your main role as a sin is when the team fight starts to kill ADCMages as fast as possible then to come back and help with the rest of the enemies. This way even if you have complete noobs in your team they wont be bursted down so fast and might actually do something. Now if you have feeders early on then theres nothing you can do. Also your build is fine even tho i would switch your spell to maybe Retribution to steal enemy jungle Flicker or Purify.

11733787,0,t1_dgpp0en,ok i understand the build part thats nice. Zhaos spear triggers within range. so when i see a fanny cable go across me i prep to fling her while she is in range. fling triggers a little late so it looks like she continues to fly away then gets flipped. same goes for everyone elses dash. i think its fine. but if you flicker or teleport away i think it shouldnt work as for Moskov alot Mobas have a version of him. i remember back then when LoL released vayne i bought her with the skin pack. and OMG she was Moskov on steroids with a bump of cocaine. those hyper carry champions are what keep people playing and spending money. keeps the game alive. ,mobilelegends,dgq1z6c,1,t5_3gvmo

11776922,0,t1_dguy29g,If you are correctly positioned and Eudora is also correctly positioned she will not be in range of you if she wants to get you in range generally she will have to go to bad position and open herself up to your teammates. If you find you are dieing a lot to her sacrifice damage item for magic resist item dead heros dont do damage anyway. You survive her combo she either runs or diesSaber is more problematic as fast moving but generally find most sabers are auto targeting lowest healthclosest anyway so if correctly positioned that will not be you Vs a good saber or other assassins you will just have to suck it up and pray.,mobilelegends,dguy9fw,4,t5_3gvmo
