2182765,0,t1_clh8kxl,Dont have a price breakdown yet one might be coming in the future. I really dont think I would have done anything different. It does what it needs to do well and it looks good doing it.I chose the lightest frame I could find for the least amount of money.It is velobuilds vbrI really like the black on black on black look and others have pointed out that they like it as well.Ive put around  miles on it and it has done them all like a champ. The only problem I had was with the front shifting but I eventually ironed it out. As long as youre careful and know what youre doing you really cant mess up a build like this. Its a great bike thats light fast and good looking all for way under typical retail prices. I highly recommend Chinese carbon.,ChineseCarbon,clha6dc,1,t5_3281n
