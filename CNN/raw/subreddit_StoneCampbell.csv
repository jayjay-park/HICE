649918,0,t1_cgdxuza,Sorry didnt mean this to turn into a wall of text.  Ive broken it up a bit.gtIve been thinking about this all day though. Southern California is an interesting model.Ive noticed that about California.  There are a good amount of progressive churches and I dont doubt that Pepperdine has something to do with that.  I think its unfortunate that Cascade College up in Portland closed but I think its impact on that region of the Northwest will continue for years.gtThey compete in the same market as the large Evangelical churches like Vineyard and they can do pretty well.I too have been pretty concerned about our imitation of Evangelicalism especially when I see that movement headed into a sharp decline.  I think part of the problem is that many do consider themselves Evangelical.  Do we really want to hop on board a sinking ship?  I know Reddit is a small sample size but among the rChristianity crowd you see a lot of young Evangelicals moving away from those churches and looking for something else...something more substantial.I think we want to be cool.  Who doesnt want to be cool and popular?  But as we found out in high school coolness and popularity arent exactly sustainable.  I think in a lot of ways Churches of Christ are inherently uncool...and this is a good thing!  While a cappella singing has been a recent popular trend a la Pitch Perfect and The Sing Off I dont see a lot of other churches ditching the praise band.  Congregational autonomy can be a headache especially for ministers.  Having Communion every Sunday interrupts the singing.  That sentence hurt me to write but my wifes parents megaCofC started streamlining the Lords Supper for that reason.  Alexander Campbell must be rolling in his grave...Am I saying we should be intentionally uncool?  No.  We dont want to be pretentious hipsters.  Im saying that we shouldnt let those reasons be the deciding factor as to whether or not we adopt or abandon a practice.This leads onto another point why do we do what we do?  It saddens me at just how little people know andor care.  Ive ranted before on here about how uninformed our people are on church history.  And for years our systematic theology has been heres our prooftexts!  While the more progressive churches have certainly abandoned that way of thinking what have they replaced it with?  This goes back to your point about distinctiveness.  If we dont know why were different were going to cease to be different.  And if we cease to be different we might as well join the others.,StoneCampbell,cge5990,1,t5_2yemh
