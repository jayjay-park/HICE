6388203,0,t1_czf0glc,Its not about bottoming out that makes me think you dont understand what collapse action is.The best example of collapse action is a lightswitch you can feel it by trying to teeter the switch on the actuation point as soon as you pass a threshold the resistance changes and the switch wants to go to the other position. This means if you want to have the switch activated for short and precise interval both not one or the other youll have to be constantly fighting the collapse action.Buckling springs have a partial collapse action when the switch passes a certain threshold itll collapse to a nearbottomedout position you then have to lower the amount of pressure you place on the button just to get back to the actuation point.With linear switches the resistance is the same except for optionally the bumpclick of the switch activating which varies depending on switch type. There is no collapse action forcing your position.Reds and sanwas are different from blacks. I switched from sanwas to reds to blacks for my movement keys on my buttonboard.,shittybattlestations,czfrt8r,1,t5_2sni8
