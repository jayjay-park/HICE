1402310,0,t3_2a6rfe,Well I dont know what you expect it to be. Its for a franchise that as of this moment no longer exists. Theres not going to be the daily updates on or off season on other teams subs. Even off topic stuff like players shenanigans or nonnba related activities and ventures arent really gonna be relevant either.Even highlight reels of old games The Glory Days or whatever you want to call it can only be taken so far and people would lose interest in them if they were reposted all of the time.Posts regarding the possibility of expansion or an existing franchise moving to the Seattle are only going to pop up when the rumour mill is spinning and even then Id say the excitement will be taken with a pinch of salt in this sub.And with regards to the Thunder theres a separate Thunder sub which follows OKC and their endeavours.Saying all of that I would love for the sub to be more active and in a positive way. However I havent thought of a way it can be maybe someone else will ignite the spark to make it a community worth spending time in.Edited for the dreaded grammars.,Sonics,cis25v1,17,t5_2sk92
1413017,0,t1_cis517s,There are over  million people in the region between San Francisco Bay Area and the Sacramento area. Thats more than the entire State of Washington. Just because were close doesnt mean were the same. There is a huge difference between the Bay Area and Sacramento. Claiming that we should just give up the Kings and become Warriors fans is completely absurd.And as far as the distance goes thats an absurd notion as well. Sacramento is further away from San Francisco than New York City is from Philadelphia. Should Philly just send all of their teams to other cities and root for New York teams because theyre only  miles away? No thats absurd.The Sacramento region has nearly . million people. That doesnt include places like Stockton over k in the area and Modesto over k in area Reno  or k people or even Fresno over  million that get Kings games broadcast on TV and are home to many Kings fans. The Kings leaving would have affected a region with many millions of people just like Seattle was affected by the Sonics. Two wrongs dont make a right.It sucks that the Sonics left. I enjoyed watching those great teams in the s and was sad that they moved. I legitimately want to see the NBA return to Seattle so I can see those green jerseys again. But the attitude that you and many of your fellow Seattle fans have towards relocation is not only illogical but very offputting. Youre not going to garner any sympathy by foaming at the mouth every time a team is in trouble and is rumored to be for sale. It makes you look petty and predatory.You cant demonize David Stern Howard Schultz and Clay Bennett for the Sonics going to OKC and then turn around in the next breath and praise Chris Hansen and Steve Ballmer for trying to do the very same thing to a different city. Youre either for relocation or against it. If youre ok with the Kings or Bucks or Hawks coming to Seattle then you have to be ok with Bennett having moved the Sonics to OKC. You cant call that man evil and then claim Hansen to be a hero for trying to do the same damn thing.,Sonics,citefpe,2,t5_2sk92

3123963,0,t3_2vxohu,I get that they cant just expand out of no where but they are going to miss out on the best oppritunity to invest a team into the city.  At this point I fully expect NHL to arrive sooned the MOU to be altered for hockey.  Man at this rate I bet the sounders get their own stadium funded and built before the NBA comes back.  I dont understand the hardball theyre trying to play in a city that will give them much more exposure ,Sonics,colsq28,8,t5_2sk92
4565882,0,t3_3dijhu,Im actually hoping for the arena more for hockey than basketball. I know Ill probably get shit for that statement. Sad part is theyll black out my Colorado games. ,Sonics,ct656m9,6,t5_2sk92

8202399,0,t1_d5104j9,Im in full agreement that location matters. I dont think the NBA particularly cared about the long term success of that market though they just need a good small market team to be good to give the rest hope. San Antonio is the only small market it has the largest footprint in the country but has very insular mindset that has truly achieved success and the only reason they continue to attract free agents is the culture they have been able to establish based on their drafting acumen and Popovich which you can argue they dont qualify anymore. Every other small market has been somewhere to get away from not go to with the caveat that organizational strength can matter Indy stays strong despite being Indy plus SA but only so much when weighed against where you have to be. I think thats why teams like Milwaukee Denver and Sacramento are never strong FA destinations no matter how much money they have. Unless they strike personality gold like Utah did with StocktonMalone they are generally all bound to lose their top tier players after so long.What sucks though is that the era of destination basketball didnt take off until after the Sonics left and Seattle was removed as an option conversely shifting to a city that arguably becomes the worst in the entire NBA Sacramento is a strong contender but at least its an hour from the Bay Area. KD leaving that city makes all the sense in the world to me even removing my biases about the state because why would you be a young rich businessman and limit yourself by staying there?I disagree with your premise that this wouldnt have happened if the Sonics were still around though. The Sonics hadnt had good management since....and half the reason KD left was his belief he wasnt getting over the hump where he was. The biggest slap in the face about the franchise movement was the fact they drafted Serge Ibaka right after they left torturing us again by actually getting a competent big man after we watched so damn many misses because our draft guys sucked! The Sonics displayed no ability to get out of their own way since  and considering the biggest local group trying to buy the team was headed by Wally Walker do you really think that would have changed? ,Sonics,d52uqqa,1,t5_2sk92

9051375,0,t3_5414a2,I dont know what Seattle has done to deserve this man but I can not applaud him enough for his steadfast effort in getting an arena built. He wants basketball in Seattle so bad hes spent so much money and has worked for several years now trying to get a team back here.,Sonics,d7ztxm5,4,t5_2sk92
9401750,0,t3_58lszs,Maybe if he wins with the Warriors this year and gets his ring hell come home to the city he was stolen from. I mean it successfully turned Lebron from league villain in Miami to the hero of the league it would be a good way to turn KDs league reputation around too.,Sonics,d97qktb,2,t5_2sk92
