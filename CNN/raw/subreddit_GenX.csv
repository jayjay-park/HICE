We got a few years of EXTREME ltcrap they tried to sell usgt but it didnt work very well.

10880740,0,t3_5via9v,Its just a range of dates with a label mainly used for marketing. It doesnt mean youre branded and part of a heard who can only identify with one group. Tail end Gen Xers and early Millenials such as yourself and as you noted  are fluid and shift between the two demographics. Geez I sound like Im describing astrological signs.Im sure a subterm similar to Generation Jones will be developed. Gen Jones being late Boomers early Gen xers. Gen Y was originally s and s kids. Then Millenials expanded it to include early s. I personally think Gen Y should still be its own thing from a cultural perspective but marketers love that grouping of Millenials. Millenials versus Boomers apparently makes for a great story.,GenX,de29rmf,12,t5_2qur9
