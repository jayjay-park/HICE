Dont tell me anything about her character though! Anywho on to the critique. Overall its great! Only two littleminortiny complaints.First off her highlight isnt the same width throughout on her mane. Not the one on her bangs but the one of the back of the mane. Also it looks kinda sharp like it doesnt look like its supposed to look like that. Second her face isnt round. On her right side our left side of her face theres a bump. Its very hard to notice but it is there. Other than that top quality work! ,MLPvectors,cp7yr0g,1,t5_2stxe
