1064862,0,t1_chpbpcm,Sure Ill be happy to update!  I feel bad because weve barely met them and Im already giving them all this news they dont want like that ditch across your pasture is actually ours no you cannot fill it in actually we are going to make it deeper this weekend yes its legal for us to do that oh also the junction box needs to be replaced and wed love to split the cost because you will use it too none of your fencing will hold goats hay is currently  a bale not  and we dont have extra to sell you ... sorry.Edit  Also it seems unfair because we have an escape artist dog.  Hes  senile and harmless and has a loop he does up their driveway looking for the old owners dog who ranged free and then back to our yard... but if we cant contain our dog why should they be expected to contain goats?

3848887,0,t1_cqujy2l,The tests with the vet ended up being prohibitively expensive so I wont know for sure but I agree with you that I think the cattle blockscopper are to blame. I cant blame the pasture for maybe having something new when I know the blocks are new and different. So those are going back to the feed store asap.The moral of the story appears to be NEVER buy supplements for sheep that arent for sheep regardless of what you are promised...

3870315,0,t3_32mjsb,a word of advice about goats...... dont ever think your fence is good enough and they cant get out... they WILL always challenge the fence... and if they can climb it..go under.. go through... they will get out lol. ive seen goats ontop of barns.. getting out of fences that way lol. ive seen goats put their heads under chainlink fence... and scoot out that way.. ,livestock,cqxg776,1,t5_2rgs1

11706585,0,t3_5w9mjt,Depends what youre looking to do. Id almost always say run with Jeresy or a Brown Swiss over a Holstein if youre not willing to deal with calving issues which theyre notorious for. I know of several small dairy herds around my area that have gone with milking shorthorn and seem to have good success with them. If youre looking for just personal use look into one of the Landraces mentioned below theyre older stock that were bred for several purposes instead of the monofocus breeds like modern Angus and Holstein of these I cant offer as much knowledge but even what nowadays is called a beef animal can produce a fair amount of milk if youre willing to short change the calf a little. We had a highlander that easily produced enough for our household and then some...you just had to skim the hair off the cream first. ,livestock,dgmywly,1,t5_2rgs1
