1760785,0,t3_2enco1,I dont think theyre my  of the weekend of course that goes to Darkside but they outdid my expectations by a long shot. I was only going to stay for the first few songs and then head over to Ty Segall ended up staying for the entire set and loving it. ,FYFFest,ck13r52,2,t5_2x912

4833055,0,t3_3gz3xp,Off the top of my head... Last year the entrance to the festival was completely fucked. If you cant get there early prepare to possibly cheat. The Arena is the only stage where you would worry about missing part of an act entirely. Yeah the seats will be open this year but with the bottlenecks it could take you a while to even get in the building. All other stages are very loud and sound great from way in the back as well as the beer gardens. Beware of bands that follow another band with a different sound... Deafheaven last year was unlistenable due to shitty punkstyle mixing  If you like dancing the arena floor is completely fucked... except for the right side left side from performers perspective. The sound is surprisingly good off to the side and the floor is in great condition so Id recommend going there. Often especially in the Arena sound is shit in the front row. Back up a bit and you can have a better overall experience. If a problem arises and they want to kick you out of the Arena DONT LEAVE THE ARENA! Unless you see flames or something lol. Overall there will probably be fewer major fuckups this year than last. On the first day I like to cover all the tents I can better chance of free stuff get this out of the way. Last year there was a tent giving away free stuff in exchange for empty bottles I got a tshirt. Make sure you know when they close each day its surprisingly early! I attached a bag to my belt to collect the bottles Its going to be HOT!! I reccommend wearing sunscrean hat and sunglasses you dont mind losing or breaking. Or hide out in the arena till the sun gets low. You might be able to get free shitty sunglasses this year depending on the promos. On water its free and you can bring in an empty water bottle into the grounds and fill it. I like to bring in a small disposable one flatten it and cap it and keep it in my pocket then uncap inflate and reuse. Definitely drink plenty of water. Bring lots of cash as food and booze are expensive. Craft beer isnt that much more than crappy watered down beer so I recommend the craft beer garden to everyone! If you take public transportation you should at least park and ride from a stop. Last year both days I walked a mile to and from my local stop and I was feeling it hard the last day. Expect to walkdance A LOT during the festival. Dont tighten your own wristband too tight and definitely dont tighten a friends as a joke you asshole. They cant be loosened. Dont be that guy. Fuck. FYF is one of the most friendly festivals ever. I meet so many cool people. Talk to everyone! If youre going alone pretend you dont feel awkward and dance the night away or find another awkward nerd to hang with. The faster bands WILL have mosh pits particularly at the Trees stage. Prepare for that if you want to be up close. If there isnt one going Ill start it myself! I notice theres a Which Wich nearby the venue at Expo and Fig. Ive been to another location and its freaking delicious. Im totally eating lunch from there before the fest each day.,FYFFest,cu3qv1i,2,t5_2x912

8717397,0,t1_d6uexxr,I noticed that tame impalas live set hasnt changed THAT much this year so if you go on youtube and look at the tracklist in the comments for one of the festival sets you can make a playlist that will be very close to their setlist. I did that for Phoenix a while back and was tripping my friends out when I was able to predict half the songs they played ,FYFFest,d6vbb3j,1,t5_2x912

11260654,0,t1_df8c9db,Precisely. The setup they had with EDC back in the day was perfect. There were many entrances and exits to the coliseum. The greatest part of the whole thing was the coliseum seating. You could just chill in the stands without having to be amongst other crazies which would be really great for those of us who really want to relax and enjoy the artists,FYFFest,df8dmuu,1,t5_2x912
