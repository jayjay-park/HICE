1295749,0,t3_28opb4,I really wanted this show to be good but its just...not. Inconsistent writing inconsistent acting  and devoid of characters that spark interest. This is a pirate show without piracy or swashbuckling or anything that makes the golden age of piracy so intriguing. Just a white goatied Blackbeard that dresses like a hippy and talks with a strange accent that grates on the ears. Everybody is too clean too polite. I dont know what kind of pirates these are but theyre far more boring than frightening. ,Crossbones,cifdzzs,2,t5_2vd5t
