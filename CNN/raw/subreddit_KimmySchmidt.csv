Its commonly confused with Booty House but Booty House is Chicago House not Det. Techno...  Still just as degrading to women of course.Booty House replaced ghettotech in popularity years ago and is slowly started to be replaced in popularity itself by juke.  Juke just isnt as fun though.

That a white actress was cast to play a character who we are surprised to find out is Native American? It wouldnt have worked with an actual Native American actress. The point was that she felt the need to hide who she was to become successful  which is wrong. Its such a fucking nonissue. Try experiencing some actual prejudice.,KimmySchmidt,d25wj8y,33,t5_31og7
