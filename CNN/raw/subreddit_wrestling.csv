358764,0,t3_1xvfe8,Here are some exercises that help me out a lot my coach too  Squats. Even better box squats. Even better paused squats. And   squats as well with these you squat completely asstograss come up a quarter of the way fall back down and then explosively fire right the fuck up.   squats will work wonders on your hammies and VMO development. Power cleans and full squat cleans. These are self explanatory. Pullups or even better climbing rope. So many variations to choose from. Example. Deadlift. Deadlifts will make you better at anything in life However sumo stance deadlifts will make your hips VERY strong. Even better Superset with dips. Rollouts. A bit strange this one. I make motorcycle sounds whenever I do this one. Its a great abdominal exercise because it uses all of the muscles in the anterior chain as a secondary recruitment and it so good for shoulder mobility. Video And finally my personal favorite aside from deadlifts the overhead press. The OHP is the granddaddy of all shoulder strength and really all upperbody strength in general. Im going to go ahead and say it right now fuck bench press. Im probably the only man in the weight room that hates it with a passion and avoids it.Simply this Keep your strength and conditioning simple. Dont fool around with systems and methods that claim to be the best because they all claim to be the best. Just get under a barbell and bust your ass in the weight room so you can bust more asses on the mat. Good luck.,wrestling,cfhya7w,2,t5_2qqam
369375,0,t3_1yaxsr,I was in the same shoes as you were before. First thing is practice learning to shoot for takedowns to get the feel. The most important thing technique wise is learn to SPRAWL because during practice you will get taken down especially with all these mad dogs wanting to test techniques on a new guy. If you simply learn to sprawl youll be much harder to takedown than the joe that doesnt. Conditioning is important too because wrestling is an exhausting sport.,wrestling,cfj1uqy,2,t5_2qqam

The advice I like given to you is to watch as many other matches as possible especially around or in your weight class.First off I wouldnt go in to any sport with the mindset I was going to get pummeled and lose even if that may be the outcome at this point in time.If you are wrestling at  or lb class as far as technique in high school they are usually the weakest and you get a lot of out of shape guys standing on their feet pushing and tugging. Come out with a good stance be ready to sprawl if your opponent takes a shot and think of what you are going to do on offence. Have a goodtime and just do your best until you can get in the practice room and have your coach teach you technique. Being on the football team I am certain a Blast Double will deffinetly be a move you will love to add to your offence and will more then likely win you a couple of matches during the season Good Luck!,wrestling,cw6saky,2,t5_2qqam

5561078,0,t3_3r9mta,I did this my sophomore year to start varsity.  I was Weighed  and cut to  in less than  weeks to take the spot of our starter that got injured.  I can easily tell you it was the worst experience of my life and I did it wrong in so many ways.  Ill tell you what not to do and some of it may sound obvious but I still fucked up haha.. Go for a run right now.  Seriously Im assuming you are in high school.  Our practices started the week after thanksgiving I wrestled year round at a club team but I didnt start the cut until too late because I wasnt expecting to cut.  You still have time to preemptively drop weight even if its just  lbs between now and then it will help.  Start runningcardio every day id even say twice a day. .  This is something I battled with but eat right.  Im not a nutritionist now and i definitely wasnt one back then but once the season starts you really cant afford to eat anything that isnt directly going to help you.  Seriously dont put yourself in a position where you will eat snacks.  I remember being like half a pound over the night before a meet and telling myself Id have a candy bar because it weighs nothjng and I can just float til weigh in.  DONT do this it will literally break you down and you will lose out on so much energy throughout the season.  Id also look into pedialyte my drill partner treated that shit like heroin he swears it helped so much..Sleep.  This isnt even about cutting weight you just need to be smart and get your sleep. Youll be more alert and coupled with your decreased calorie intake you wont fucking feel like death walking into homeroom every morning.

7260896,0,t3_4etecz,Its important to understand that cutting weight and dieting are two separate things.  Cutting weight is what you do in the days leading up to weighing in.  Dieting is what you do in the months leading up to the start of the season.  When dieting for wrestling youre going to want to keep your protein intake high your fat intake moderate and your carbohydrate intake very low.  This will allow you to lose fat while maintaining muscle.When cutting weight you are simply dehydrating yourself.  This can be extremely unhealthy if taken too far or for an extended time.  That being said all of the most effective methods saunas rubber suits etc are illegal in scholastic wrestling.  As a coach my advice would be to get your body fat as low as healthily possible prior to the start of the season and cut no more than five or six pounds on a weekly basis which can be easily achieved by restricting your liquid intake for one day and wearing sweats to practice the day before the weigh in.,wrestling,d23iguk,5,t5_2qqam

What you need to cut down on eating is EVERYTHING.  meals per day of a couple pieces of spinach on top of rice and a gram of tuna.

Maybe he cant beat him right away with what he knows but hes still inexperienced in wrestling. He may need to apply himself to learning and perfecting his wrestling technique before he can beat him. That makes it more about devoting himself to hard work which has no ceiling as opposed to believing he can do it now as is failing then losing hope. Make it about trusting the value of hard work.

9332001,0,t3_588dqw,My two biggest tips will be to actually wrestle. See if you can wrestle  times a day. Wrestle in the summer. Wrestle after season and before season. You dont have to be going hard the entire time but actual time on the mat is unbeatable. My suggestion for time increments is to do technique  of the time working on specific moves full wrestle  time for technique at  speed working on specific situations and go live  of the time. Always try and wrestle against the best. It feels defeating not getting a real takedown the entire practice but you will breeze by others that arent as good during tournaments.My second piece of advice is to video tape your own matches and write down the common mistakes you make. Pick one or two of them to correct and as you correct them move down the list.  You may know that you need to have a low stance but during a match you may stand straight up or you may know that taking reshots are important but during an actual match you may never really do it.  Other random tips Aggression it cant really be taught but if you can learn how to wrestle aggressively you will end up on top. And by aggressively I mean by fighting for everything and being mean about it as well. Its tough to balance with technique but most great wrestlers are aggressive as all get out. Get your cardio up. And not by running miles. Do HIIT training circuits etc. Preferably the best way to get your cardio up is by wrestling against multiple fresh people in short high intensity spurts. Watch matches and learn techniques and strategy. Go to wrestling camps. Its a great experience and you will walk away as a better wrestler. Get your diet right so you dont have to cut weight like others do. You will almost certainly cut water weight anyways but thats all you should need to cut near the end of the week.,wrestling,d8ywds6,2,t5_2qqam
