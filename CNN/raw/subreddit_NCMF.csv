4986735,0,t3_3j4dmf,Have you never been to a festival or concert before? All festival sites say illegal drugs and alcohol cannot be brought in. That should be obvious but they are not going very thorough through your things. They are going through your stuff for like  seconds so hide stuff where they wont find it. No security is that tough and especially a small festival. There are soooo many ways you can get stuff in. You can put in wallet or tape to shorts or inside bra or put in coat pocket in bag or get sunscreen flasks or other kind. As long as you dont look like a shady person they arent looking hard. Just be normal. ,NCMF,cun343j,1,t5_2ufgr

8862593,0,t1_d7d2w5u,Ill be honest I had no idea how much work goes into his shows like I said it was my first bassnectar concert and I in my own ignorance expected something more than what I got. I will agree with you  that it is entirely the organizers fault and that bassnectar did an amazing job with what he had. To your point about him not being as much as a showman as other performers that goes to show that I admittedly know very little about bassnectar. You seem to know a whole hell of alot about him and I really respect that. Youve certainly changed my perspective of the show and of any of his shows Ill attend in the future if your suggesting his Halloween show in Peoria im strongly considering it now.I should learn the facts next time before I try to call out one of the biggest dubstep producers out there,NCMF,d7d5qgi,8,t5_2ufgr
