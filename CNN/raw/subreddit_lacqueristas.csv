9390208,0,t3_597hk3,I get this with every combination of polish and topcoat I have ever tried.  The more flexible my nails are the worse it is.  I gave up and do my own hard gel nails now and just use regular paints on those.  No more cracking!  What might also work to give yourself a more rigid painting surface is some soak off structure gel  like Gelish brand and the  Gelish LED light from Sallys.  If you keep up with backfills and use only nonacetone remover you can use your regular paints on top.  Less flexible nailsless cracking.  I am trying this for my mom right now and it seems to be working great.  The soak off stuff is much cheaper that the hard gels and is in most budgets to do.  About  total to start and about  every few months for new product.,lacqueristas,d969xhg,5,t5_2sog2
