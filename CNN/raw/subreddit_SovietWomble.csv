8912202,0,t3_52bz8m,The franchise changed from from a realtime strategy to a realtime tactical.The first Dawn of War and its expansions saw a rapidrush to claim territory the swift building of your armies to match your population cap followed by titanic battles between k forces that would often leave hundreds or thousand dead. Units were interchangeable and expendable and often require sacrifice in great numbers to achieve victory as you moved quickly between different army configurations to knock your opponent off balance. Which fit the theme of  very well.The second game was a much tighter affair. Battles were smaller usually involving handfuls of soldiers rather than companies and a strong emphasis on hero units and the activation of wargear and powerups at the right times Rewarding those who focused on and memorized the capabilities of each unit type in order to use them effectively.As if to further highlight the difference Dawn of War  shipped with a sort of laststand multiplayer mode. Where a group of three special hero units would have to hold off an attack from waves of faceless tyranid goons Yep. Just three!Now its not to say that tactical games are bad. In fact my understanding is that Dawn of War  is very good. Its just very different from the design philosophy of Dawn of War . And it aliened a lot of fans.Id also like to quote something from the dchan description of life in the k universe gtImagine being a citizen of the Imperium of Man. The first thing youll ever know is that your individuality is worth jack shit. You are nothing more than a drone a coin spent in an unimaginably large system so that other coins can be spent elsewhere continuing the cycle. No one around you is ever expected to show you any kindness respect you or see you as anything less than another drone in the system. No matter how lenient your planet and government is how strong an influence the Ecclesiarchy is where you live and how tough work you are expected to perform this is the unfortunate and unchangeable truth that makes the Imperium what it is.Everyone even the mighty Space Marines die in droves daily on nameless rocks all over the galaxy. This is not the sort of universe that rewards the actions of the individual or even remembers them. So the presence of hero units especially is quite perplexing. It doesnt fit the universe its set in.Dawn of War  would feature a Space Marine identified by his rank a Force Commander. And youll get through  of these fuckers in a good fight before you defeat your enemy.Dawn of War  this is Hero Unit Marcus Aurelleus Stellarious Captain of the Golden Arm equipped with his mighty Hammer of Destiny he righteously judges and smites the tyrannid hordes singlehandedly and...no no no no no...stop.
