Adam Lanza the Sandy Hook shooter is a prime example of someone who needed help early in life and was cast aside in our state.It may be worth noting that I sarcastically readpost in this subreddit.

You need to do some more research. this does a good job explaining it for you however  Trump supporters are not racist. The fact you even believe this is shocking as a fellow American. We as in many people I know who voted for trump did not like the clear corruption and the MSM failing to do their jobs for the American people. We didnt love our options with Trump but as a responsible citizen I could not support what Hillary stood for and did. I didnt go around calling Hillary supporters idiots who refused to educate themselves on their candidate or who refused to hear the other side and the continuation of the Democratic rhetoric from the election is appalling. The divide in our nation was caused by this stuff and it needs to end. Its not US vs Them and if you believe it is your a part of the problem.EDIT Seems relevant so I thought I should mention that I supported Bernie during the primaries as did many of my friends who also voted Trump.,ThanksObama,d9wz4ie,40,t5_2ss1n

9605802,0,t1_d9x0awp,If Im elected I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things Trump said. They have ruled on it. I wish that it was done by the state. I dont like the way they ruled. I disagree with the Supreme Court from the standpoint they should have given the state  it should be a states rights issue. And thats the way it should have been ruled on Chris not the way they did it.Decades of public support doesnt mean shit when youve built a campaign on a certain set of ideas. gt The hypocrisy of liberals treating a Trump presidency like conservatives treated the Obama presidency...Were not. The conservative issues with an Obama presidency were largely baseless racist fearmongering. Obamas secretly a Kenyan Muslim who wants to forcibly round up the guns and institute sharia law!!!!!

I believe that the justices comment is simply the side effect of choosing traditionally conservative judges I could be wrong.  But hes hes said multiple times that regardless of his thoughts on gay marriage he supports and agrees with the Supreme Courts decision and will not fight it as its not his place.

10289067,0,t1_dca4chz,Hey. Its never too late to further your education. I was  when I went to get my degree and  when I graduated. I started working when I was  and paid for my own way through college. I went private and came out with a bunch of student loan debt but the financials gains Ive made because of my degree are outpacing my debt quite a bit. My cousin did the same thing but went to a State University and federal aid paid for everything outright. He graduated debt free. Federal aid can make going to college very affordable and easy once you cross the  yo line since you no longer need to claim your parents income. ,ThanksObama,dcabl7d,1,t5_2ss1n

10408968,0,t1_dcnvqk4,Id like to point out that the Syrian Civil War is a very complex political and geographical conflict. With so many sides claiming to be against Assad and on the side of the rebels it has become difficult to distinguish who is who in this entire thing. Take the FSA for example in the beginning of the civil war the FSA was clearly led by officers deserted from the Syrian government however as the fighting went on the faction became more splintered and less distinguishable as a single entity. That later led to many radical rebels claiming the FSA flag as their own while not even really being a part of the group or sharing the same goals. Now could you provide some sources showing how the Obama administration funded the FSA? Id like to see how exactly he helped them.,ThanksObama,dcnxa8x,4,t5_2ss1n
10409245,0,t1_dcnwlg4,So ineffectual at consensus building on a topic with a strong moral and public concern.... real presidential qualities there.Many things were negotiated prior to his taking office I think the idea of politicians particularly brilliantly wonderful ones is that they can change things that need changing. Or if they fail to convince others at least put in place contingency measures to mitigate against the negative aspects of the change.Hmm i dunno about you but Actively and intentionally continuing to support Pro Jihdist rebels anti government action in a neighbouring state whilst following through with a preapproved draw down agreement in iraq doesnt seem like something that would make an appearance in the big book of smart moves for a president particularly one whos already seen his administrations libyan regime change plan go royally tits up.Granted he does appear to possess sufficient self awareness to concede in  that not preparing for a post ghaddafi Libya was probably the worst mistakes of his presidency it isnt the worst syria is.  The question remains  Given he freely acknowledges that he fucked up in libya yet still insists that assad had to go.... precisely how doesdid his non existent post assad plan vary in any meaningful way from his non existent post ghaddafi one.,ThanksObama,dcnyewh,-2,t5_2ss1n

10419749,0,t1_dco5x0g,I dont know why people constantly forget that the President is not a dictator  he cant just make things happen. Most of the control is within Congress. There were policies that Obama put forth that didnt pass Congress. McConnell and other Repubs were intensely proud of the fact that they managed to block Obama on so many things  things that wouldve been beneficial to the American people you know their constituents? I dont know when the government forgot about the people they were meant to serve but thats probably the point everything went to hell. ,ThanksObama,dcp5b3k,1,t5_2ss1n
