153474,0,t3_1vu3dg,At what point did tipping in the US become mandatory regardless of quality of service? In my European country tipping is rare. I grew up with the understanding that in other countries you tip if you get especially good service. I mean you pay for normal service. You know to get food on the table for instance. Why should I give you extra money for doing your job? If youre extra friendly and give me exemplary service Ill gladly tip. What I dont get is why many people in the US dont seem to ask the question Why? when dealing with tipping. Why do you tip if you get normal service? Why is it ok to not pay a waitress any salary but instead force the customer to be responsible for her pay? Why? I dont think a reasonable answer is Because its customary.,Infographics,cevwuit,3,t5_2r1ee

In this case it needs adequate entropy. Rules that restrict available passwords reduce entropy per character length.An  char password with ridiculous rules can be less secure than a   char password with rather more relaxed rules.In the end though passwords are a bad choice where authentication really matters.  factor or even multifactor schemes really are needed far more than they are used.,Infographics,ci2ny7s,1,t5_2r1ee

They found that doing more compressions was much more effective.When I was a medic in the army I saw a study where an EMS unit cut out breaths all together and saw a substantial improvement in outcomes.Fuck all good that did me. Medics rarelynever do CPR on the battlefield. If it was only one patient and the shooting had stopped Id do it because why the fuck not. If there were other wounded people tough luck because Im moving on to people I can save.In the civilian world if youre trained in CPR you can save someones life.

5608142,0,t3_3rxvzc,The main set of physiological processes by which nutrients calories from food are used to produce the cellular energy that enables living systems e.g. humans to exist. Glucose is converted to pyruvate which is then converted to acetylcoA and then the TCA begins. The resulting biochemical reactions cause an electron transport chain of which the net output is Adenonine triphosphate the unit of intercellular transfer. When there is an excess of nutrients available the surplus is converted to triglycerides which are combined with various other chemical compounds e.g. cholesterol so they can travel across the bloodstream until they reach the adipocytes bodys fat tissue cells where they are stored for later use. Inversely where there is a shortage of nutrients available the adipocytes release their nutrient content which is reassembled into lipoproteins and then travels across the bloodstream until it is converted back to free fatty acids which can be converted and ultimately used in the TCA. Continuous excess of nutrients which is physiologically manifested as a continuous fat tissue uptake of nutrients as triglycerides will over time result in a proportional accumulation of fat tissue around various organ systems. For example visceral fat tissue is the accumulation of fat tissue around essential organ systems such as the liver and the pancreas. Clinically the longterm outcome of this phenomenon is obesity type  diabetes mellitus disglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities.,Infographics,cws8t3x,0,t5_2r1ee

But the government should not force other individuals to give you a portion of their bread. In other words if someone has a huge amount of bread and is capable of giving you bread but doesnt want to then he has not abused any of your rights.

11442066,0,t3_63adnl,I think a few others are missing that are already occuring. Realtime data visualisation and manipulation Google Earth is mind blowing with this stuff Relaxation and meditation. I love feeling like I have some new sense of place that I would otherwise need to visit by taking a plane or boat to get there. Sure I some sensory information wouldnt be there but sitting at a VR beach and doing some light reading through the headset would be amazing. I loved feeling a sense of calm and bit of escapism with new worlds I could inhabit. Education. While Im very excited about this from a historical perspective I think this also allows for classes to be created where people can attend from their homes and have a mock classroom. Shootif the headsets get comfy enough we could maybe even go to Yoga Class or exercise a bit with a virtual personal trainer customized to know you progress. ,Infographics,dfsy4i0,2,t5_2r1ee

11471658,0,t1_dfwa5c1,Ok a few thingsYou dont know how to use ironic quotations.You dont know what liberalism is if you think that it rejects income inequality as necessary part of life.You dont know the purpose of a minimum wage.To follow I will simply ask you this who are you to determine who deserves to be poor? Who are you to allocate tax money? Youre not inherently better or worse than a cleaner who works minimum wage a CEO of a major company or a midlevel manager at McDonalds. Most of the people working minimum wage earn it doing hard labour for  hours a week. Other do it via long shifts in the service industry. Now tell me is it right that a person working  hours a week still needs to receive welfare or beg on the streets to survive? Aside from the moral factor its economically a waste too. Raising the minimum wage to a living wage would relieve the government of having to provide various welfare to many of these people. Its also a great way to stimulate the economy after all the poor have a much higher propensity to spend than the rich do. When a working class person receives a wage increase they perhaps buy an up to date car or to buy new furniture from a local store so businesses benefit too. If the rich get a tax break the new money is more likely to be stashed away in some offshore account to get a better interest return.  ,Infographics,dfwb2cq,13,t5_2r1ee
11539092,0,t1_dg3y7ys,It would be one thing if it was just American companies ripping off Americans. America tends to have the highest GDP and therefore you have everyone in the world piling on America and trying to get a piece of the pie. There is just not the incentive to erode workers rights in Australia simply because there is not enough people making enough money for it to be worthwhile.It also almost seems like people are pushing that  dollar minimum wage thing because it is more of a localized type of thing whereas doing something like establishing  hours per week as being a full time work week would be a totally globalized sort of standard for workers. Theyd rather see minimum wage go up in one area than see a solid standard of integrity for all workers.This sort of patchworked schema were seeing develop where full time is now a flexible term and people are going to be making  dollars here and . there is really more of a scheme to totally break any expectations people have. That makes it easier to hire some people for . an hour and other people for  dollars an hour or make people eventually work  hours a week without getting paid any overtime. To top it off again this is partly due to people from Saudi Arabia or other foreign countries wanting to make money off the backs of Americans that sort of pressure does not exist as much in Australia and countries with better workers rights.,Infographics,dg3yica,3,t5_2r1ee
