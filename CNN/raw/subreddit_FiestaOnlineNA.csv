4476698,0,t1_csumii5,I have a Mage lvl  on Epith where I grew with the game I used to have more chars but this was my main I downloaded the game for the nostalgia somethings have changed but mostly everything remains the same as I remember for the game.Then I got mixed up feelings I used to spent alot of time there with my guild friends that I didnt even know in real life but they were there all the time  we hang around doing missions we created an apart forum in order to get to know each other.We started to know each other and talk each other outside the game we become friends and we like the game alot we were like  ppl that spent their time togheter.The Nostalgia hit me as soon as I got in the game.,FiestaOnlineNA,csuyhbb,1,t5_31fjw
