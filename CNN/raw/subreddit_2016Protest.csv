8042181,0,t1_d4jwhoe,. We would need the police and military on our team. Yes its doable. We can figure it out. . Keep increasing the pressure. They will eventually get squeezed. I really think we can do it peacefully in my heart. I dont have anything personal with any of the oligarchs. My issue isnt with them. My issue is with a nonfunctional system that has failed us for thousands upon thousands of years. This we can all agree on. Top down government may temporarily work but its not a good long term strategy. We can utilize politicians in a new government but they would be of equal power more or less. We just need someone to present solutions and bring awareness to potential problems. Occupy Wall Street is one domino in the domino effect that will bring mankind into a new golden age. I am personally confident we will do this within  years so thats not the issue from my perspective. The issue I see is that we either move now or wait for a complete collapse and then make a move. We can lose decades rebuilding if we wait too long is my concern. Or we can move now and change the course of the American vessel so it points us in the right direction which is a wealth based system that rubs off on the entire country. One step at a time is the key. One day at a time too. ,2016Protest,d4k0m0b,1,t5_3f3tw
