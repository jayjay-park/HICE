282499,1,t1_cf9w5k9,Im sorry but on point iiHe went on to have a relationship with Mia Farrows adopted daughter SoonYi.  Lets frame thisSoonYi was already Mia Farrows daughter when Allen and Farrow started their relationship in .  SoonYi was born in  making her  when Allen stepped into her life as a father figure.  The nudes were discovered  years later when she was .  Granted at the time of discovery she was of age and there is no substantiated evidence that there was a sexual relationship before that..BUT who here can say yeah thats not creepy!?  People with a normal healthy perspective on sex and sexuality are not able to be a father figure in someones life a step father from the age of   only two years after she was adopted from South Korea and then suddenly AFTER the age of  go whoa Im pretty sexually attracted to her now.... since shes of age now its totally okay!.  Also while he was only  at the time his first wife was  when he married her and after their divorce he made some public comments about a sexual assault that she experienced in a derogatory manner. So I would say that there is very very strong evidence that Woody Allen in a pedophile in that his propensity to sexualize young girls  and at the very very least be extremely careless and cavalier about young girlswomen and their sexuality.  I think that those points cant  and shouldnt be overlooked if the there arent multiple victims card is being played.  While two of those resulted in marriages there is no accounting for the idea that he might be a very SKILLED pedophile and the craft of manipulating that unhealthy relationship to seem like a healthy normal one is something he might be particularly good at. As for the writing of the piece Im not a writer for a living but I can still write something empathetic and slick...especially if it is something that means a great deal to me.

I like to base my opinions on facts. Terry? I dont know. I dont know enough actual facts to know. Here are some facts  The one who started this entire thing introduced herself to Richardson with the following email Hi Im Charlotte. Im  and a pervert. And then went on to accuse him of being a pervert.Another who came forward claimed she only got naked for Richardson once and she was so horrified by the experience she had to come forward. Since then multiple photo sessions with him where she got naked have surfaced. If youre that traumatized by his behavior you dont go back  or  more times.The next one came out on reddit changed her story about  times. First she said she went to the police and absolutely filed a police report like with a report number and all then when pressed and she got attention she said well I called then she said...she didnt.     And of course the last time Jezebel covered this story the one about Richardson sending creepy facebook messages to young models the FB messages turned out to be completely fake. a screenshot from a cell phoneI dont know Richardson and I have no idea what he did or didnt do but his accusers havent exactly been honest. In fact some of them werent even real.   I think we should be encouraging the entire fashionmodel community to report. We should be supportive of reporting and actively encourage it.

How very OReilly of you.Make assumptions about my views all you like. My days of being a dorm room politician are  years behind me son. Ive learned over the years that my views change dependent on the information I pull from various sources. You wont find me towing any particular line though I do find there are some people more dedicated to research facts rational behavior and acting in fairness to the audience they report to. Ill take in anything from the right to the left to form my own opinion. So dont be a child with your combative assumptions based on nothing.Nuthugger.Since youve made your assumptions Ill make my own. I get the sense youre a person who angrily opposed anything that challenges his own opinions because your response system is calibrated to narrow and emotional rather than open and rational.Its any wonder youre a fan.Thanks for the recommendation but I watched the debate when it happened. Didnt feel there was a clear winner at all since it was more a collaborative contest of styles for entertainment purposes. It could barely be called a true debate and there were probably terms agreed beforehand as to how far they could go. It was certainly not an ass handing like he delivered Tucker Carlson many years ago. But that said being belligerent and talking over people never qualifies as winning in my book. No matter what information is spraying from your noise hole. And that my friend is Bill OReillys specialty and while he more often loses IMHO.But hes more than just an asshole. Hes made it his job to rile up an angry demographic who doesnt quite know why theyre not content with life. Hell take peoples natural tendency to be dissatisfied pretty much a human condition and attach it to an agenda that often flops on the side of mildly bigoted.

Like when she signed her name for the contract with her first manager. She also made a sex tape with him. Now he has the rights to release the sex tape. This was a mistake she made because she was naive and fame hungry. Yes she is ignorant at times and yes she has made racist statements in my opinion. But this isnt what this article is about.

2072080,0,t1_cl355tf,That is an excellent question! Perhaps I chose the wrong word in describing it the first time. I will clarify by suggesting it may be more accurate to say bodily sovereignty as in we own our own bodies they are our property.Our bodily sovereignty means that we have the right to control who sees us naked and when. Thats a basic human right.When this right is violated we are stripped of our ability to make choices about who can or cannot see us naked.Emotionallypsychologically being stripped of this right is inherently traumatic and degrading. This is particularly reinforced by our culture which suggests that those who lose or even those who intentionally relinquish this control are less human and less deserving of basic decency or respect than others. They are frequently considered less moral even when the violation was outside of their control this is why school teachers who have exes who post naked pics of them online as revenge are fired rather than receiving sympathy.Does that make sense? ,entertainment,cl37gjs,3,t5_2qh0f

3131540,0,t3_2vzgnh,This is going to sound controversial but I actually liked the movie. I am a liberal person have done all sorts of sex stuff and so is my girlfriend neither of us are into SampM. But considering the trash that the book was you have to give credit to the screenwriter because from that perspective it was surprisingly good.Sure it had plot holes and it was trashy in places but its far better than I would expect from an average Valentines film that has Cameron Diaz running around beaches drunk and in love.Sure  Shades movie is never getting any awards or praise. But its a really solid B and was a pleasant surprise to me. And it did open interesting discussions between me and my fiancee about sex and control and what could lead to people finding this type of stuff interesting.And we both agreed that the acting was surprisingly spoton it actually had to look awkward and it did. Had it been full blown chemistry it could not have worked. But it worked because these two characters were broken and fucked up.As for the sequel? Im sure theyll make them. But I actually think that the first movie worked really well as a standalone. Knowing the plot of sequels which are godawful in grand scale I find it unlikely that Ill see them.But ayways keep an open mind. If you are even a little intrigued about seeing it go and see it.

Because his parents hid this they blew away any chance of him or his victims receiving helpful appropriate and effective counselling. No one got help in this situation. I had a friend whose teenage brother molested her when she was  and he was . It started with the same sort of stuff that Josh did but eventually became worse. When her parents found out the reported their son to CPS and the police. He was arrested and he was charged as a young offender. Legally that meant it didnt destroy his life. But he was able to access in patient and out patient treatment for entire youth. He was sent to live with his grandparents and never returned home. Its a sad and fucked up choice but the parents had to protect their other children. I cant imagine how heartbreaking that would be. But it was the right thing to do. Its the only choice that gave both the offender and the victims the chance to get help and heal. Hiding it just fucks everyone up.He got help but he isnt cured. He is still sexually attracted to kids and he still gets counselling. His parents have a relationship with him thats very surface like and he has no relationship with his siblings because of the abuse he committed. Its awful for everyone but its the least awful outcome. Its less awful than doing nothing or letting the abuse continue. Or giving him a stern talking to only to have him abuse again. When you read the homeschooling materials the Duggars used that teach kids about sexual abuse you get a small glimpse of their fucked up logic. Gothard actually lists immodest dress and badevil friends as potential reasons why God let kids get raped. Ugh. If theyd actually gone to the police maybe Josh would have had a chance to fix something that is now destroying his life and tearing his family apart. As a juvenile maybe he would have been given the resources he needed.And if theyd actually gone to the police and CPS maybe their daughters would know that their safety is paramount. That their well being is above protecting an abuser. That they have no fault in what happened.

4684176,0,t1_ctkx2nr,gtYou are completely confusing the issueIm completely clear on the subject but you dont seem to be...All of your straw man examples are already unregisterable marks. The USTPO would reject them outright for lack of distinctiveness for Nike or for simply being the name of the product in your silly cake example. gtto trademark a widely used simple term within the industry is simply wrongAnd it is usually caught by the USPTO and rejected or a suit is brought and the mark thrown out. Microsoft Windows developed out of the early s when the term was hardly well known or commonly used. At that point it was novel and therefore registerable. If they had gone with a different name and a company now tried to register the term in the software world it would likely be rejected. gtbecause that would imply that it crashed regularly....This is exactly why trademarks exist. Youve hit the nail on the head. Consumer identification is the primary reason trademarks exist. To call a program a windows program when it doesnt actually run on the well known Windows operating system would be confusing to consumers and most likely intentionally malicious. Consumers assume that something using that word as its product name in the software world is associated with the operating system and with Microsoft. Trademarks arent the problem. They work pretty well most of the time. Nonnovel patents and grossly extended copyrights are where the ire needs to be directed. ,entertainment,ctkziei,1,t5_2qh0f

4736890,0,t1_ctrhgi9,Weird behavior? Ive seen one that claimed he was dirty and didnt clean up after himself. I think that hardly counts as inappropriate sexual conduct.Or are you talking about Adrian McManus? The exmaid who testified in the  trial that she had never seen MJ do anything inappropriate with a child and would be comfortable leaving her own children with him. She only changed her tune after she was fired. She also admitted to selling untrue stories to the tabloids to fund their lawsuits against MJ for wrongful termination. She also stole multiple items from neverland and sold those for profit as well.I definitely think MJ was a little fucked up. It would be hard not to be considering his childhood. But I dont think he sexually abused anyone. At least I dont think theres any actual legitimate evidence for that. The  trial was obviously bullshit because they admitted it was. The  trial is HIGHLY suspect. The mother has schizophrenia and the family has a history of extortion.

The reason I say movie and not season is that as much as I did enjoy the recent season I miss Troy and to a smaller extent Pierce I know he is deadand Shirley. Without them in it the show starts to feel like something different all together especially with the character arcs the people still on the show were having in the sixth season.

10358860,0,t3_5o7tf9,I thought the film did a few things well and some things poorly like most films do. SPOILERS BELOW! It showed the desperation of the rebellion. The Rebels were doing increasingly shady shit to stay in the fight and they were basically losing. Cassian is killing his own informant and is fully prepared to continue to be an assassin.  Saw Gerrera is a paranoid who can justify any means to reaching the end that even he knows is nearly impossible. It explained why the Death Star had such a ridiculous design flaw in Episode IV relieving that film of one of its issues. Jyn is about her father. She doesnt care that much about the rebellion and even when she begins to come around in a dramatic speech I got the impression that she was saying what she needed to say in order to carry out her fathers legacy rebellion or not. If Cassian had planned to shoot someone other than her father I doubt shed have cared or interfered.  The nature of data is very odd in the SW universe anyway. They have artificial intelligence and computer interfaces from the s. They have planetsized force fields but the plans are still stored in a video game cartridge which by the way can be distilled into something small enough to load into RD. I know thats all part of the SW universe but in this film the whole climbing the tower to retrieve the correct cartridge seemed contrived and drew attention to this fact in a negative way. Who the hell is Baze Malbus? Though I think I might have enjoyed the character I kept getting back to Who the hell is this guy? Chirrut mwe was far too obviously following the blind monkzen archer archetype including the bowlooking weapon. While the character was well acted I felt the lack of originality. Darth Vaders role until the very end felt forced. I would have used him as the Rebellions boogeyman who seems to show up at all the wrong times and create desperation in the rebellions plans. Hed just need to be mentioned with lines like It was going just fine then Vader showed up. No one survived. or We dont know where Vader is which means he could be on his way here right now and wed never know it.  I also would have put him in his TIE Fighter in the ending space battle ripping apart Rebel fighters before boarding the Rebel mothership. This would tie it in to Episode III as Anakins style prove Vader is a badass pilot and make his appearance in the space battle in Episode IV that much more ominous knowing that he can singlehandedly turn the tide of a space battle. It was nice to see a nondesert planet though. Apparently those exist. ,entertainment,dci8k4b,3,t5_2qh0f

While Hillary per se did not spend the majority of time on identity politics there was enough surrounding and being glommed onto her to the point that Trumps insensitivities became more of a positive for him rather than a negative.
