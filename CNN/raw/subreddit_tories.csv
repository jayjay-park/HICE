7614483,0,t1_d37ngrj,Haha yeah IDS was about as popular outside of Tory circles as Hunt!  It might work if Labour decide to bring Blair back but outside of that... I say was as hes seems to have gotten a little bit more popular since leaving the Cabinet. My personal choice would be any one of these Boris Gove Fox or perhaps a little bit more out of the box ReesMogg or Dominic Rabb. ,tories,d37q6l1,2,t5_2sh7k

The economy has been completely turned around and the deficit has been cut by two thirds etc etc.Also do some research into your local representatives for each party  see which ones have done the most work and represent your views best.Id advise reading or briefly looking through each manifesto Conservatives Lib Dems or this patronising one,tories,d5fnftr,1,t5_2sh7k
8346136,0,t3_4ts72g,Lib Dem here.She was fantastic. Less of the cocky pinkface that I found heavily distasteful about Cameron. Answered questions and stuck it to Labour strongly.About the only gag that I dont think landed well was the one aimed at Tim Farron  and not because Im a Liberal. It just seemed like rather crude humour!,tories,d5ktjdu,3,t5_2sh7k
