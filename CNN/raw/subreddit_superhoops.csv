Ravel didnt clap the fans when he got substituted that irritated me  doesnt seem to have much interest in playing for us at all.

968478,0,t3_2577te,I think we really miss Phillips and Faurlin. I say youre spot on with the best  to play.In the case of Yun I made this comment elsewheregtI think theres certainly still an element of risk with Yun as we havent got a full picture of what he can do but Id play him in the first  and would have done from a few months back. Effort and speed in one package are not available elsewhere right now. He also has big game experience  the  Olympic Bronze medal match in front of k against Japan with that little Dokdo Islands drama in the background. If I remember rightly the team were promised exemption from military service if they wonOf course he wasnt facing a language barrier in that game.I thought Ravels reaction to coming off was quite a good sign for the next one or two games...he is certainly an office tempexternal consultant character but he looks like he wants to perform which should be good enough for us.We should never have let Onyewu go.

The players who are here aside from a few are here to play with Redknapp. Maybe some of them havent worked out but i doubt any of us would have thought the likes of Richard Dunne was good business but he has been one of our best players for a year and a half now. and i know the game is so much more than the ins and outs of the team but having a group of players who want to be here for the team and manager is huge.
