350789,0,t3_1y3f38,Correct me if Im wrong but isnt that the room Brian and Seth got dragged into by the operator after Alex lured them there?

641313,0,t1_cgc4s7d,Id just be a little disappointed because it seems too easy to put together that Brian is Hoody. Id expect something mind blowing or more complex. Like what if Seth stepped back in and he is Hoody? Seth is barely a character at this point but I think his reveal may be more shocking than Brain. Nonetheless when we do figure out who it is the reveal will not stop me from completely freaking out in amazement. like I do with every entry ,marblehornets,cgd61uu,1,t5_2s77o
687701,0,t1_cgi7gc2,Id say he acts like a vigilante of sorts just in the way he acts. Hes reckless but he has good intentions and its clear from entries like  that he and Tim have similar intentions bringing down AlexTO but of course he knows it cant be done without Tim being in his Masky state as seen in entry .,marblehornets,cgifyr9,2,t5_2s77o

1008905,0,t1_chic9je,I think thats the most reasonable. They could have used water instead of gasoline for the inthehouse scenes and then switched to actual gasoline for the patio shot the transition to it was a bit too convenient for that to have been shot at Tims house.

1982244,0,t1_ckrz0pu,Okay to start the posdcasts will now be put out on Wednesdays because Joseph is back in school. As for the DVDs Tim is  done the S DVD fixup and is rendering stuff for S overnight while finishing up S. Troy says they need those ready before the end October for GMX Tim remarks itll be a photo finish. Turns out making and beta testing these DVDs is more time consuming than he thought. As for the the BluRay no word on that yet but expect it to take awhile because I remember Tim saying a Posdcast or two ago its a whole new software to learn when he gets around to it. Any time one of these gets posted feel free to comment on it asking for any info if you dont get time to listen to it and Ill give you the info when I finish listening to it myself.,marblehornets,cks27hh,5,t5_2s77o

4145259,0,t1_crsnoxs,Entry  Entry  and Entry .Entry  is his first appearance. He accidentally forgot to film and walked onscreen briefly.Entry  is when he and Alex explore that weird basement. In the end he screams a glitchformed face appears and Alexin his own housesays that Seth is gone. This is Seths last appearance timelinewise.Entry  has him Jay Tim and Alex running through the rain. He briefly appears on screen says a few lines and then leaves. This is his last appearance entrywise.These are Seths only known appearances. It is speculated that either he was filming Entry  but this is unconfirmed and the only evidence to suggest this is the fact that if it was Brian filming he would have likely added something to the discussion about his house. He is also mentioned in Entry  in the list of people Alex says are gone although considering that SPOILER!s Jessica was included on the list but made it out alive its not beyond the realm of possibility that he is out there somewhere.,marblehornets,crsry7k,5,t5_2s77o
4410372,0,t1_csdctqv,I just remember an entry where theyre in one of the main characters houses in the day theyre  being stalked by the shows masky and it being totally intense when he forces himself in. IIRC  that is the entry that made everyone hop on board. It scratched an itch that others besides maybe EveryManHybrid never did seeing a gang of nerds shit bricks all at once without being magicd apart. Besides the homeowner it was their first time seeing masky and I dug the candid feel of their reactions to some masked murder hobo. Could totally be misremembering things. I doubt it holds up today. The magic is probably gone. ,marblehornets,csms83r,1,t5_2s77o

7862251,0,t3_4myrz6,Heres whats happening in Entry  and its not an acid trip.. Hes being sent through the Operators teleportation in ways that harm him mentally and physically as a form of control by the Hooded Man. The Operator and the Hooded Man know that Tim is resisting the mental change into the Masked Man persona and its only a matter of time before Tim will be exhausted by the fight and give in.. Hes experiencing a PTSD episode at certain parts. The Operator is triggering experiences and visions that are oddly visible to the camera that cause Tim to go through an episode. Tim is also probably hallucinating a bit at this point.. A part near the end has flashes of a bit of everything. Thats probably the Operator doing whatever it can with whatever it can just because it can.,marblehornets,d3zsdqg,6,t5_2s77o
