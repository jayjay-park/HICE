4657432,0,t1_ctgucg3,I do try to stay positive and theres nothing no one can do but hold your head up high and get on with life is what I say. I had eye operations and the back operation. I seem to have it quite badly internally. It would be nice to chat and get to know each other not just because you have nf but to format a friendship and theres alot of understanding between us. ,neurofibromatosis,cthml6n,1,t5_2t4qg

Feel free to pm me though.As to the progression over the course of her  months Im not sure. I remember that shortly after she was born and not yet diagnosed I noticed that her right eye was bigger than her left eye but I didnt think much of it back then but it means it was already noticable just after she was born. A babyskids face changes so much during the first few years of their lives however she looks nothing like she did a year ago and will probably look a bit different a year from now as well. I cant say that the asymmetry has gotten a lot worse though just a little more obvious as she has gotten bigger. Yes her right eye looks a bit different from her left eye and the upper right part of forehead is a little steeper than the left but it all falls within normal ranges I think. She doesnt look like a disfigured person at all and if you wouldnt know you couldnt tell. As for the operating I think you are right. It also has to be quite a severe case from what I understand as its merely seen as a cosmetic issue.,neurofibromatosis,de30jff,1,t5_2t4qg
