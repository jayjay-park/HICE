83656,0,t3_1v1yb8,I have never heard of US Government Cheese and Ive worked as a monger and now work making cheese on a dairy. Do you mean this If so it seems like it hasnt been made for two decades and it was probably terrible in any case.EDIT To justify that last statement  It was processed using leftover bits of Colby cheddar cheese curd or granular cheese mixed with emulsifiers to give it a blocky shape. The taste and smell can only be described as a cross between very lowgrade American cheese a generic Velveeta knockoff and a somewhat rancid cheddar. That sounds pretty fucking terrible.,Cheese,cenybce,-4,t5_2qhyg

577692,0,t1_cg5sabi,If your boss cares about keeping spoilage down keeping margin up and providing your customers with quality cheese that isnt going to start growing mold within a couple of days of purchase then theyll let you refrigerate your ambient display cheeses at night.  If those things arent high on their priority list then unfortunately youll just have to keep throwing out a lot of product.  Cleaning the rind well before cutting is good advice but no amount of cleaning and sanitizing is going to keep mold from growing on cut cheese thats been at room temperature for two weeks.

2808402,0,t3_2s7w51,It is possible that your wheels may have been on their way out but many people do like to have the slight ammoniation funk so sometimes they stay in cheese cases to be sold. Many times if the cheese is just hitting the hump they can blow off their ammoniation with a little airing off. I would recommend talking with your cheese monger ask to try washed rind cheeses that are young rather than an older wheel. I just opened a wheel of Chimay that was really young and supple with a very mild paste and more yeasty notes to the rind. Whereas Ive also opened some wheels of Chimay that had those mustardy beefy feety flavors that knocked my socks off in the best way however that wheel I did need to let the rind blow off before enjoying the paste. You may just be super sensitive to ammoniation and might want to steer away from soft ripened washed rind cheeses and towards something more firm like a Fontina Val DAosta or even Raclette.

Any good cheese shop should be fairly generous with the samples and will be able to tell you lots about each cheese.As far as pairings go you have so many options and it widely depends on the type of cheese. Wine or other adult libations compliment it well in many circumstances due to the highly aromatic nature of both cheese and alcohol. I enjoy a nice cheese and cracker plate as an appetizer and usually compliment the cheese with some fresh fruit apples pears grapes pomegranate seeds are all good choices some dried or cured meats salami pancetta soppressata prosciutto capicola etc. or pretty much anything else that youd find on a typical charcuterie plate such as olives pickled vegetables salted nuts pate etc. Honey or jam can also be used to compliment certain cheese.Musthaves for a new cheese fan Brie Camenbert Gouda Manchego.,Cheese,d1pu2dl,3,t5_2qhyg
