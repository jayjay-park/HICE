4172440,0,t1_crvuuhe,What big word did I use ?Read the article and stop trying to be a pseudo intellectual. Depending on which interpretation you choose to use the general meaning is two fold  one the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double and two that the performance will double commonly within  months. However not all of this is from a single person at a single time. Eg its not a scientific theory.As such  The pattern still holds and will hold for a number more years again RTFA.  The performance of computer chips as we currently understand them eg silicon may well reach the end of its useful life in this regard  but could continue in both largermore complex chips or using different types of fabrication technologies andor materials.Anyone stating anything about any technology progress stopping is a fucking moron and seems to not like studying history or understanding that as a species we continually work around obstacles and invent new ways of handling problems that years before hadnt even been considered.,kurzgesagt,crvv619,4,t5_339ie

5142629,0,t1_cv5u4mg,gtIts pretty hard to integrate when you are getting discriminated and persecuted.  I can tell from first hand this is not the case here. They are here for hundreds of years why do you think most of the western people have problems with them when they move there and a lot of them abuse their welfare systems? Even France started deporting them back to Romania.  gtplease dont generalise a whole population by single incidents  There are too many single incidents every day what do you think e.g. the USA would do if Mexicans would just attack their borders break through the fences and just swarm the country thousands a day for free pass to Canada?  gtArson or bonfire? I have yet to hear from arson even though that story would probably go through the roof.  Why is setting up a bonfire with tires in the middle of the highway of a border passing point or in a city is acceptable?  gt using children as source of media manipulation  gtNow you are getting ridiculous. You cant blame refugees for what some media tries to protray them asExactly the point I try to tell media portray them as they wants thats why they create these situations because they know they will come out as a victim in the western media. Dont believe me? Watch this video   This is how the western media reported it Washingon Post The Guardian BBC just to mention only .  There are raw footages live stream videos police reports and personal videos about migrants where they do totally unjustified harmful things even to their children to appeal to the media.,kurzgesagt,cv5vn7j,5,t5_339ie
5145158,0,t1_cv63eeg,hm Yes. well Youve misunderstood my point a bit and also I think taken the video a bit too literal. Besides this I generally agree with you. My point was not that all foreigners are angels. I was just addressing the fear that foreigners tend to be dangerous criminals. This is as kurzgesagt points out not true. Foreign people are also people. I just want others to acknowledge that.As always Kurzgesagt points out that their video is a simplification of the situation. They are not saying that every single specific problem will go away if we take in these refugees. They are really just saying that we as countries should help the refugees not ignore their problems. And step  is just to help those refugees to safety.,kurzgesagt,cv66nbp,-1,t5_339ie

5393955,0,t1_cw0zenz,Here you go tip open this in a new window and continue reading this side by sideIts a graph showing the absorption of different wavelengths by water. Higher line means electromagnetic waves will not travel as far. Because the waves at the wavelengths of visible light we just call that light are not absorbed seacreatures evolved eyes that could see those particular wavelengths. Why those wavelenghts? Well.. because other wavelenghts like ultra violet are almost entirely absorbed by the water which basically means youre looking at a dark wall of water.Imagine it like thisSay youre a creature swimming in a liquid that absorbs all light except green light. Which means the only light that is going to reach your eye is green. It would make a ton of sense to develop eyes that can see green light not red light. Red light doesnt travel through the liquid youre swimming in so you will never see red light.Replace green by visible light and red by infrared and ultra violet and you should now understand the whole idea behind this ,kurzgesagt,cw14z5k,6,t5_339ie

The only reason why the horizon exists is because light cant escape. If you are able to reach escape velocity you would be able to come out once you went in.
