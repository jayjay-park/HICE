5993366,0,t1_cxc7so4,Because its so far away! The company I believe is stationed in new york somewhere so shipping fresh ingredients within  days in the continental us is possible but to alaska it would either take longer than that making the produce not fresh or it would cost more which would put it outside the parameters of the product. They wuld probably have to build a shipping center in Alaska somewhere in order to ship throughout the state there. If you know anything about food production or anything maybe you could contact them and look into helping them establish a center there or something.,blueapron,cy59ecd,1,t5_2yo21
6718574,0,t3_47nixn,I used all of the red pepper flakes and it was slightly spicy not too bad. I actually didnt have shrimp in my portion As I dont like shellfish. I was looking forward to the cabbage but it seemed like an afterthought. ,blueapron,d0e9bun,1,t5_2yo21

7824263,0,t3_4lyfk3,I found the buns super doughy  I had  and I was stuffed. Later eating the chicken alone was good. I filled the buns using a fork and kind of pressing the chicken into the bun so it stayed put. I dont think a spoon would have worked so well. I found the flavors were very yummy. I liked the Miso slaw.,blueapron,d3viif2,2,t5_2yo21

8667995,0,t1_d6p3h8a,I would say it wouldnt be a crowd pleaser for everyone. But I love the simple Asian stuff like this and the noodles themselves were phenominal and the sauce was big flavor too. EDIT This would be simple enough to make yourself though. Id be happy to send you a picture of the recipe card if youd like. ,blueapron,d6p4bd1,1,t5_2yo21
9209511,0,t3_56hkvc,I give myself a week to make everything but I leave the veggie option for last if I know Im going to use the whole week. You can also freeze the meats to give yourself a little more time. The other ingredients are ok for maybe  days. Depending. ,blueapron,d8jdh2u,1,t5_2yo21
9831922,0,t3_5g0nym,Most business that deal in food or foodservice need to run about  COGS to be profitable. So your estimation of  on  is probably about right. That said I used Blue Apron on and off and for the most part its been a really positive experience. Ive liked many of the recipes enough to reproduce them in larger quantities for days worth of lunches and obviously cheaper.They arent really selling you cheap food theyre selling you the value propositions of elegant menus and always changing dishes along with the lack of waste and easing the burden of whats for dinner.My unrelated expenses increased a lot this year so Ive been skipping my shipments lately but I really like their business model and the customer service has been very good when theres an issue. ,blueapron,dap4d7s,8,t5_2yo21
