1193273,0,t1_ci3v1cy,ampampamp Betteridges law of headlines sfw gtgtBetteridges law of headlines is an adage that states Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no. It is named after Ian Betteridge a British technology journalist  although the general concept is much older.  The observation has also been called Davis law   or just the journalistic principle.  In the field of particle physics the concept has been referred to as Hinchliffes Rule. gtBetteridge explained the concept in a February  article regarding a TechCrunch article with the headline Did Last.fm Just Hand Over User Listening Data To the RIAA?gtgtThis story is a great demonstration of my maxim that any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no. The reason why journalists use that style of headline is that they know the story is probably bullshit and dont actually have the sources and facts to back it up but still want to run it. gtInteresting Sensationalism | List of eponymous laws | Sport in Birmingham | Ashford Kent Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcivh oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecivh.

Its super close to South and you can easily run on Somerby Drive without worrying about dodging traffic. Ive checked out multiple apartments around Mobile and I have always come back to StoneridgeIts off the main roads and you have access to Hillcrest with a stoplight which is amazing if you are hitting early morning traffic youre close to tons of grocery stores resturants and all the important roads.
