185842,0,t1_ceylzpt,Im not so sure that the statistics themselves are conflicting so much as the various ways of expressing them narratively can give wildly different feelings.E.g. per month numbers make the amount of infertility look high while phrases like the majority of women  will get pregnant within a year make it look low.  But really the majority... what about the other ? Also  year olds and  year olds arent the same  aggregating them into one category hides the decline during that time period.,Natalism,cezlt04,2,t5_2vp2p
673152,0,t1_cggs80h,ha yes... but at least this time he was promoting our cause!But more generally as I repeatedly try to convey here... theres no real reason natalism should necessarily be red conservative or religious.  Although it often is in practice these days.,Natalism,cggscr8,2,t5_2vp2p
792296,0,t1_cguc1p5,Sounds like a reasonable proposal to me.Hmm Im not sure I know of any places that have pronatalist education.,Natalism,cguc68p,3,t5_2vp2p
792331,0,t1_cgu2wmn,Right its amusing to see them veer off in the pronatalist direction... but really noncoercive population policy is always best.,Natalism,cgucbeg,2,t5_2vp2p

1257209,0,t1_ciaupig,Ive been meaning to add WikiEditor to my list of hobbies for years now but Ive been procrastinating.  This sub is nothing if not a fantastic file folder filled with evidence about population trends and their implications.,Natalism,cib1uhd,2,t5_2vp2p
1731945,0,t1_cjxh26p,Ha yes  but thats ok.  They have made an important life choice and its only naturally to seek out likeminded people.  Oh also Last mentioned the ideal fertility rate issue at the very end of this interview as well. ,Natalism,cjxh5lz,1,t5_2vp2p

2141889,0,t1_clbyfbi,You are correct... its humor but on a subject relating to natalism.  ,Natalism,clc2yje,2,t5_2vp2p

3138161,0,t3_2w15ah,Anyone who is moderately familiar with Italy knows that the regional differences are stark.  I wonder how the birthrates differ between Northern Central and Southern Italy.  Obviously I do not imagine that anyone of these regions is hitting it out of the park but I cant imagine that theyre all identical either.,Natalism,con9mfz,3,t5_2vp2p

5123252,0,t3_3l6hg5,Could it be that this change in status from laborer to sacred consumer combined with the economic crises of the modern age drove western society to low birthrates? Will this be the doom of society?,Natalism,cv3jlai,3,t5_2vp2p
5329027,0,t3_3nxwft,Not a bad graphic!I appreciate your postings here thank you for your contributions.The only thing I might say would be that natalism per se is really only anything that results in more babies.  There are both conservativetraditionalist and liberalprogressive approaches to making more babies.So Im reluctant to go too far into family moral cycle type stuff myself.  Because its easy for natalism to get confused with conservatism the prolife movement and other related but distinct ideologies and movements.  ,Natalism,cvsuejc,2,t5_2vp2p
7612872,0,t3_4jl4yv,I think this measure makes very little sense. Birth rates are very important but why is there no research into the causes of low birth rates and why isnt the Government addressing the causes instead of just paying people to have kids? I bet if they charged for the right to have kids everyone would want one!,Natalism,d37jl4n,1,t5_2vp2p

9056588,0,t1_d80g84t,Ok so you want us to stop procreating so you do want us to go extinct?gt we can choose wether to have children or notNo you can choose whether you will have children or not. There is no we in making that decision it is entirely personal.Some want kids some dont want kids. Some want to exist some dont. That said there will always be some people who want kids and we will forever keep procreating until our inevitable extinction.  Meaning you choosing to not to procreate will not stop what you consider the issues with procreation.,Natalism,d80gglb,1,t5_2vp2p

9382379,0,t1_d957g7i,Just because its a standard practice doesnt make it any less serious of a decision. Getting married is just as standard as having a child but its still a majorly lifealtering decision that needs to be carefully thought out before going through with it. The same needs to be said for having kids. Its asinine to bring someone into existence just because thats how it is.,Natalism,d95a72l,1,t5_2vp2p

10841437,0,t3_5v0apk,I was going to try to find out the most recent statistics but apparently the hospital was decommissioned and shut down sometime in the mid s. It seems impossible that theyd still have  births per year but theres no good way to compare now.,Natalism,ddy7uga,2,t5_2vp2p
