5883337,0,t1_cxqe1q7,I go for the ring of equinox as it saves you space and a think a little gold so it helps out more ways than the face of the mountain. However if you feel you need the extra protection like uPsychedelicWaffle had said or if you like the active on it better.,BraumMains,cxqu77u,1,t5_38pju
7232493,0,t3_4ehv0o,I wouldnt like that skin even though alot of champions have skins that doesnt make that much sense to the champion but I cant see Braum as a bankrobber...however something like a police inspired skin similar to Volibear and Trundle would work nice with his shield. Or this one Bedtime Braum,BraumMains,d20a560,4,t5_38pju

10354463,0,t3_4zgsu0,Thanks!!!Regarding locketgtFor starters BUY THIS ITEM EVERY GAME as long as your opponents dont have a primary AD sitting in every lane.This is no longer the case with the reworked locket right?,BraumMains,dchqm0c,1,t5_38pju
10496981,0,t3_5q5pxs,Be aware that my answer about Bond of Stone goes contrary to the advice given in this guide from a player with much higher skill and game knowledge than me who recommends Colossus.With the nerfs to Colossus I definitely prefer Bond of Stone even more but it all ends up being your play style so my best advice is to try at least  games on each and see which feels better for you!,BraumMains,dcxxyvu,3,t5_38pju
11149153,0,t3_5z6cp5,Ive been taking the pact and I think its way better than courage now. With Q and then the stun proc its basically permanently on one target. Add in the ult and I think this is probably the best keystone for Braum yet.,BraumMains,devqt6t,10,t5_38pju
