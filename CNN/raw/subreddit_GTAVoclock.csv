655934,0,t3_21lktm,I have an idea  We are never going to agree on a specific vehicle because everyone likes different things  I change my cars weekly as I cant decide even with x characters and  tuned cars.The theme so far from the comments seems to point towards OffRoad Vehicles which I think is good as we all have sports and Supers for racing anyway.Why dont we say that are crew vehicle is OFFROAD class no bikes or buggies maybe pick a selection to choose from. It would make crew pictures a bit more interesting as well instead of all the same car.As far as the Heist argument goes  A fast x door is needed but it does not need to be a crew car. Plus standing on the side of a car with a  or  star wanted level is only going to end one way. Exmplar Felon Jackal  all good for this plus lots of others.Plus I dont want to have the same car in both my Characters garages as I feel I loose a space for something else.So My suggestion is  we pick from a list and chose a few. Example belowSandkingBF InjectionDuneloaderBodhiRebelKalahari Mesa Merryweather GrangerSultan I agree on this but not sure it should be a crew car  not a true offroadThis is only a suggestion so please rip it apart and say the good  bad points and let me know your opinions on this. ,GTAVoclock,cgetvgv,2,t5_3149y

1297487,0,t1_cif95u7,All of the above  Plus I have to agree with all the points you have made Steve. R praising the hackers that our creating the problems is just madness and the main reason I wont buy a shark card. However  you should not give up on the game. Just hang out with the crew. Dont worry about anything else. Just join the crew have a laugh. You dont even need to actually play much  just come along for all the funny banter and crazy crew moments. ,GTAVoclock,cifl1ed,2,t5_3149y
