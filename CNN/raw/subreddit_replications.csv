2246576,0,t1_clpbqro,If you just smoke the leaves it does very little if anything. My roommate extracted several pounds of leaves into a small amount of concentrated resin.

If there is a disturbance of serotonin and GABA activity perhaps the cortical columns or the grid of the visual map becomes visible. ,replications,cqrrphi,1,t5_341j0

9349172,0,t1_d910ztq,Get your hands on some if you get the chance. Its really a special molecule. Not only is it more colorful its warmer and more inviting and the visuals reflect thatsoft edges mild color palette etc. Whereas LSD can be analytical and quite serious at higher doses ALLAD is friendly with a light headspace very forgiving. It also has a much shorter duration compared to LSD which is awesome when you dont wanna be stuck tripping for  hours.,replications,d912pzl,6,t5_341j0

9645807,0,t1_da21887,Sounds to me like you had a very potent tab most likely an RC.  I could see half a mg tab of CNBOMe doing that.  ug is quite literally incapable of that.  Even  the most I could imagine would be on a half taband that would be a very expensive halftabwould only barely reach that level.  Anyone who sold you a tab of legit acid at that strength would have told you that it was ultrapotently laid and almost certainly would have charged a steep price.  So even if it wasnt an RC that sure as hell was not ug.,replications,da21my1,1,t5_341j0
