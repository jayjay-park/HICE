10231483,0,t3_5mhfjb,For me this is one of the most important scenes in the film and like you said its smoky atmospheric engaging. Its also very emotional and erotic. And wow that music  this scene would not be the same without it.When Deckard sits down with Rachel at the piano hes clearly paying attention to her in a meaningful way listening to her treating her as a person  much more so than he did the first time she came to his apartment. When he responds to her leading comment I dont know if its me or Tyrels niece with You play beautifully hes obviously to me anyway come to terms with himself and his feelings for Rachel and her being a replicant doesnt matter anymore. She however clearly hasnt come to terms with herself being much more than a label replicant and runs away when he tries to reach through that mental barrier and kiss her.Deckards aggression at this point is a little jarring but hes had quite a lot to think about by this point. Hes just come from almost being brutally murdered twice and hes killing some pain and exhaustion with booze so its not surprising in retrospect. But even with this you can see that hes not unkind to Rachel at any point and he appears very aware and very much in control of himself.And its easy to see that Rachel is attracted to him and he is however aggressively helping her get past her selfloathing and fear of rejection to reach the same conclusion he has that her being a replicant is inconsequential compared to how they feel about each other. The are both human at this point a term which really has no significance at all for them by the end of this scene.,bladerunner,dc3snv8,17,t5_2s7py
10313023,0,t1_dcayn4u,Yes to add thats I think your embellished fiction and not a part of the original films story line. So many things had so many loose ends and were ambiguous that really a remake can take it just about anywhere,bladerunner,dcd1cvz,1,t5_2s7py
10473366,0,t1_dctyx9q,Sorry for the bus thing. Not my intention. Its ok to explain your view.  And everyone has their own opinion.   I understand what you mean. But i dont want to see it the same way.Im just talking about my point if view.   I dont want to analyse every nook and cranny.  I just want to be in the moment  empathise with the characters. You say the film left us confused ?  I was never confused.  ,bladerunner,dcv9iq2,1,t5_2s7py
