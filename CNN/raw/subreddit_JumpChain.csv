8747711,0,t3_4zuwpe,As for the first point thats actually a major point of my own jumpchain as Im going through it. Since Im writing it out in an extended fashion Im purposefully exploring the fact that my memories are being added to since I almost never select the DropIn option. My personality is explicitly changing repeatedly despite anything I do.I think its a fascinating idea and kind of boring to just deus ex machina over it.,JumpChain,d6z49wx,1,t5_3afdm

11244803,0,t3_60hlib,If youve got mind control effects you can just use Lip ServiceMedaka Box to give whoever you want to steal powers from your Sacrificial BestowmentShin Megami Tensei then force them to use it to bestow all their powers to you. Alternatively give them Infectious BiteVan Helsing and have them give you their race? species? as an altform. The jumpmaker has said that the person using Infectious Bite decides if the person has control or not when they use it so make sure they give you control when they give you their form. Use the powerreturn aspect of Lip Service to take back your Sacrificial BestowmentInfectious Bite and go looking for your next victim.It should be noted that powers granted by Sacrificial Bestowment start at half power and need to be workedexercised to reach their original point. Neither of these takes away the powerform from the victim though they likewise will be at half power in anything they give away with Sacrificial Bestowment.Imaginary Friend has a pair Perks to share abilities but Ive never seen clarification on if its permanent or not and they have a long cooldown. If its permanent you may as well use them when available since they give the ability at full power rather than half.,JumpChain,df6ky9g,2,t5_3afdm
11523417,0,t3_63o3vg,Drawbacks and perks that have contradictory effect dont fight or overpower each other. If you take the drawback youll spend the  years under the full stated effect regardless of if you have  contradicting perks or . In effect perkspowersabilities that have an opposite effect to a drawback you take are nullified or the part in question is nullified for more complex perks for the duration of the jump.Drawbacks are meant to be something you have to find ways to work around not things you can fight head on by applying power in the opposite direction.As an example if a drawback reduces your strength to that of an everyday human you probably will want to talk your way through problems. Or you might be skilled enough at martial arts to use the enemys strength against themthough there is an upper limit to that or good enough at SCIENCE! to make a power armor or some sort of high power recoilless gun. The point is that you would be unable to beat things with just your physical strength even if youd stacked so many strength perks you could win with a casual backhand against SupermanGokuSaitama normally.On the other hand if youd never taken any strength perks that drawback wouldnt reduce your strength by the same amount as that godslayer build resulting in a negative strength and you imploding under your own weight it would still leave you at the strength of an everyday human just like in the super strong build and it likely wouldnt be as big a deal to you since its effecting you very little if at all.,JumpChain,dg26j9h,2,t5_3afdm
11614949,0,t1_dgce43y,Heh yeah probably not a good idea though there could be a drawback with them or some sort of mission with them if you wanted to add them in that is. Hmm was the the possibility to be a ferengi in any of the other Trek jumps? They did show up in the delta quadrant a couple times. Just checked and theres on be a ferengi option. Would be nice to have such an odd option too.,JumpChain,dgckc3b,1,t5_3afdm
