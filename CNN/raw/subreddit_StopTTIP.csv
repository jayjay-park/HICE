4229351,0,t1_cs29yty,This is likely to be my only other response in this subreddit. I already get downvoted for my almost always sourced opinions so its clear this isnt a subreddit for debate. I dont need it happening in yet another sub where Ill inevitably just get called shill troll vilified and PM harassment like Ive received elsewhere. If this were a subreddit dedicated to discussing TTIP it might be otherwise but you even editorialized the title here so thats unlikely to be the case. I also dont realistically see anyone posting articles that arent antiTTIP and not getting downvoted.AnywayFirst this isnt an LSE paper its an LSE Enterprise paper. The first is one of the most prestigious universities in the world the second is a consulting arm that operates as a business. Beyond that two of the three authors have done long term work opposing investment arbitration this is not to suggest that the paper is bad but that there is an inherent bias that runs contrary to mainstream academic thought on the subject. That this was a report for a governmental department suggests this should be more or less objective but lets keep that in mind.The UK already has over s BITs across the globe and has never lost a challenge however UK businesses have on numerous occasions successfully. This is something to keep in mind for all the points in the conclusion because while it might not encourage investment that is not its only purpose. Its also there to deescalate issues from the statestate level to the investorstate level. Their stance for  makes three implicit assumptions that simply have no backing.The first that the UKUS relationship will not have any rough patches in the future. This is doubtful particularly in the event of the UK leaving the EU or Scotland leaving the UK or just experience with international relations in general but not least because American domestic politics frequently trumps foreign politics. This is particularly evident during both the trade spats over Large Civil Aircraft subsidization and steel tariffs as Ive written about here  Who knows where UKUS interests may collide in the future. So this implicit assumption in their analysis is already shaky.The second is that the eventual ISDS agreement between the EU and the US will be modelled on those the US has been using in the recent future such as with KORUS and which is also shown in the leaks of the TPP. This has absolutely no factual basis and is completely unlikely. First the EU has already set the goldstandard for ISDS in CETA a model that they intend to emulate in other trade agreements and offers considerably better protections to state rights than the US model. Secondly the EU knows that such an agreement with a USmodelled BIT would never pass the European Parliament even an EU model one is questionable. They offer no backing for why they think any of this its just taken as a given. If anything the opposite is likely because negotiators know they have to negotiate with whats politically possible to pass in mind and given that ACTA was shot down by the EP a US modelled BIT is unlikely to be acceptable to EU negotiations.The third assumption they make is that China and India would be unwilling to sign up to an EUChina or EUIndia BIT because they tend to want to model such BITs on national interests. This assumption does not preclude a similar arrangement with the EU. There is no reason why an EU model ISDS cannot exist including some negativelist exceptions. but they take this as a given with once more no backing.On the subject of  they base expectations on how an EUUS ISDS would function based off of NAFTA and how often Canada has been taken to ISDS by US companies. The UK and Canada have very different national politics and regulatory cultures. Canada has lost a number of cases notably the Ethyl case which I wrote about here  and that they deserved to lose. They refer to defence costs in ISDS as substantial even if the state wins despite the fact that the average ISDS case costs  million dollars p.  and that EU proposals for ISDS include provisions that the loser pays the legal costsHaving read the report this is basically just the questionable stuff Ive pulled from the conclusion. In this report they missed the forest because of the trees. Theyve argued against strawmen theyve used misleading data and theyve come to predetermined conclusions.PS you screwed up the header of the subreddit it says StopTTP,StopTTIP,cs2brvp,1,t5_3898i
