3492341,0,t1_cpp74qk,I can totally empathise with how he felt I was diagnosed with a form of very very early stage cancer a few years ago with a different set of symptoms but Id done the same thing ignoring the signs and putting off seeing the doctor. I eventually had a biopsy and preemptive surgery so no chemo etc and have been in the clear ever since but it was extremely harrowing. Its not something anyone wants to face up to or completely come to terms with after either...your brain kind of just goes into denial and finds ways to cope. I hope that TB remains cancerfree too and that his experience helps others seek help when they need it. ,CoxCon,cpqcoct,1,t5_37805
