5654614,0,t3_3skf4b,If you want to do operations daily but dont want an intel minimum the intel to start those ops will come from where exactly?Task Forces dont set intel minimums for fun or to be hardasses.  Right now Im in a man TF with a  intel minimum which is very light doing Hacksaw through Powder Keg and we still dont start ops every day.No one wants to add almost a dozen players who dont contribute intel. Its much better for you all to decide what an acceptable minimum is than to say no minimum at all.,boombeachrecruit,cwy0dgr,1,t5_3445v
