If people really want to downvote your post theyre more likely to go out of their way to disable CSS and do it anyway. Downvotes are meaningless internet points people really shouldnt care what their karma count is.

284758,0,t1_cfa70df,I meant it that way. Ive only used it once. And I said it toward the SeanO because it related to why bitch being used for a comedic punchline is also a hurtful word.Everytime I say on reddit that the word bitch can be hurtful people argue that its not and dig into how I could feel that way. So when it comes out it can be a trigger men start me tearing a part as if I said the ultimate fallacy a woman could make in her defence. I was just saying given my history my abuse given that I was shouted at on the floor being called a stupid bitch a dumb bitch a lazy bitch. If I say its disheartening that Barbara was called a Bitch in a solo comment on a single roosterteeth thread I shouldnt have to reach back over two years to defend the stance on why bitch in comedy and entertainment to reference women is low and demographic pandering. Im a roosterteeth fan. I have been since I was . I was on the site. I watched RVB since . I read the comic. But god damn is this not the place to show one ounce of humanity.

568948,0,t3_20ldus,Every single time they release a podcast thats been done with a live studio audience like at RTX or SXSW its fucking terrible. The audio is shitty the constant growl of the audience in the background the guest speakers the entire production is utter garbage. I get it its easy to do theyre talking anyway might as well record cut and release the audio and save several hours in a week but Id rather they just save even more time and not bother. Also podcast related The live podcast format absolutely has some advantages and it produces some humorous situations that wouldnt arise in a prerecorded bit. The problem is that because its live and because they want to appeal to a broad audience and because it does probably generate a substantial amount of revenue for them its definitely a lot more tame and feels like one of those reality shows where its not really scripted in the sense that people memorize and deliver lines but its gone into with an attitude of Heres a situation or a topic lets just kinda run with it and see what happens. Its still entertaining no question about it it just feels a little less unique. Were not going to hear them talking about a couple of cunts on an airplane or get casual racism out of Burnie or any of the hilariousbutunprofessional crap we found in the first  episodes though. It would be nice if they did half their podcasts a month in the live format and the other half in the traditional prerecorded casual four dudes around a table with beer format. ,roosterteeth,cg4y0kw,6,t5_2s7g9

1123345,0,t1_chvntrb,While I like your optimism I dont share it. When the focus is taken off a single player game that had no multiplayer then the whole game suffers. Though the rare exception like Portal does exist where the multiplayer is as good as the single player and vice versa it doesnt mean other games can do the same thing. As of now the ONLY exception Ive seen is portal  however that could change but I doubt it . I wish people would stop using multiplayer as a sort of defense when I already establish that it is one of the many cancers in modern video games. This of course doesnt apply to games where the original had multiplayer for the reason it wasnt shoehorned in a sequel or its equivalent title. Now I dont think all games need multiplayer nor do I think either should disappear. However every year Im seeing less and less games without single player to me this is a disturbing trend. So in truth I see little to no reason to be as optimistic as you for the reason to which I stated.,roosterteeth,chvzgxv,-1,t5_2s7g9

If theyre trying to break into Asia with RWBY this game would most likely help....a lot. I hope the team has learnt from the criticism of the first run I think Miles especially is actually a good writer itll be interesting to see where RT takes this series but up to now it makes no sense to expand this franchise domestically.

Do a  second google search for yourself and find out. gt you seem  positive its a placebo when people whove tried it say its changed their dreams people in this thread have even said that.So people got a placebo affect from a placebo? Shockinggt I dont get why its IMPOSSIBLE for them to actually get an effect from alpha brain.I didnt say it was IMPOSSIBLE for them to get an effect. I said it was IMPOSSIBLE for them to not google it and realize its a placebo. Maybe if you spent more time reading my comment and less time turning red in the face over the fact that your favorite little company are a bunch of corporate sellouts who dont give a shit about you you would have seen that. Im not saying RT is horrible because this stuff is pretty basic business but you cant argue they give one shit about their fanbase if theyre knowingly selling them snake oil. Most people that care about their fans dont do that.  gt This argument is pointless. Im not continuing it so...yay you win. congratulations!

1454659,0,t1_ciylcyh,I feel like youre making some good points but Id like to defend a few.First and foremost the animation. In particular the action animation different? yes. Badawkward? no. I think this is a much more realistic animation stylepace for the RvB universe as compared to Montys style of animation. Now given his work is beyond fantastic but is a bit snappy and fast paced for humans in space armor. I feel the new animation pacing is much more suiting especially for the blood gulch guys. As far as the motive behind the plot twist Ill give that to you a bit. The motive was a bit stretched but I think youre misunderstanding the Blood Gulch crews purpose in Locus amp Felixs plan. They didnt deceive so they would kill a lot of people but rather to stir a fire in both sides so as to light a fire under both. As far as Felixs evil guy monologue Ill give that one to you for sure.

1543527,0,t3_2b8q22,Not sure if this should be its own thread or not so Ill post it here since it is technically a Lets Play idea.Personally Im kind of tired of Achievement City and I feel like the release of the Xbox One version is the perfect chance for them to get a fresh start. A lot of this is inspired by the Minecraft Lets Plays theyve been doing that have been planned out games which I just dont find nearly as entertaining as the earlier videos.So what Id really like to see is a brand new map on the Xbox One version. Geoff and Gavin could prepare the map by remaking the Achievement Hunter logo as the Town Center but after that I think itd be great if the next several Lets Plays was everyone picking a spot acquiring materials and building their own houses. Once the town is done they could work on another  block railway and various other builds to help with acquiring the achievements assuming the old ones wont transfer over. This would also mean New Achievement City would have its own Stronghold and End Portal to explore.I think this series of them trying and failing in most cases to work together to build their new town as a community would be far more entertaining than the current crop of Minecraft Lets Plays.The Achievement City Classic file could be put up online as a museum for anyone to download and explore.,roosterteeth,cj9r6vv,1,t5_2s7g9

The Lets Plays are just some guys and a girl messing around in games. They probably find it surreal that people take it so seriously. Take the people bitching at Micheals comments on twitter about Minecraft he messed up in the video and won because of it nobody at AH cared because its a joke. Theyre having fun and it was pretty funny when they realised that Micheal had cheated his way to victory entirely unwillingly.

1585383,0,t3_2cfiej,Ill repost what I said in regards to Geoffs comment.Thanks Geoff for saying this. I recently watched someone else nearly quit a series they were doing because of the fans being so rude to him. Telling him how stupid he was because of a block in a mod he was using that he completely forgot about. He nearly quit a series that he does because of his fans. But once he realized that the fans who supported everything he did but were unvocal about it he continued it. He realizes now that the good always outweighs the bad even if the bad are more vocal than the good.Keep what youre doing. Clearly it has worked for  years and the fans who think they have to shout out everything that comes to their heads need to just shut up sometimes. Thank you again for every single one of you for the entertainment you guys bring us. We love it!Edit For the curious it is CaptainSparklez.

My world turned upside down after that and to this day I still struggle with depression. At the time the only thing I watched on the RT and Lets Play channel was Minecraft. I remember watching them every Friday and my dad would come in and make fun of me for watching it. Eventually he started watching with me and it was fun. My dad didnt care about the language or anything so we would sit and laugh.I stopped watching YouTube for about two weeks after he passed so needless to say I had some catching up to do. But when I started watching the videos again I started laughing again. And smiling. Something I hadnt done since.And today whether its a notasgreatasitcouldbe LP like The Great Pig Race or the best LP like Easily Distracted they taught me to keep laughing.So thank you Rooster Teeth.,roosterteeth,cjgq2gs,2,t5_2s7g9

When she met Ghost Church and instantly accepted it she probably had a good idea of what happened. She probably just didnt want to put him in jeopardy by revealing it. The Tex from season  onwards in Alpha Tex .. Weve seen that Epsilon was able to create a new Tex from his memories there is no reason Alpha didnt do the same thing unconsciously.

Just like AH isnt supposed to be fantastic at every game they play Ray not included it just works because its them.Josh is a good writer Chris and Blaine are pretty good actors but admittedly the rest of the Bteam as you say is subpar but you gotta remember that theyre participating for fun and because theyve been asked to its not their primary job at RT. Theyre just trying to include everyone because theyre as much a family and a community within themselves as they are a company. Not everyone can be Joel and Matt but that doesnt mean their lack of acting skills means they should be excluded from RTs live action content.

2019937,0,t3_2hw5ps,As mentioned Compared to a Monty Oum fight scene they were definitely tame and remotely plausible p.But I think they were quite fitting. Montys scenes made sense when it was all about The Freelancers The best of the best and elite megasoldiers. Of course they are going to be running along the grenades thrown at them and engaging in rapid fire combat.This arc has been about The Other Guys. The Reds and The Blues and The Feds and the News. They ARENT superhuman well Grif may have some latent mutations to allow him to survive his horrific lifestyle. And I think all the Reds are established as cyborgs after Sarges various experiments.... So they mostly fight like everyone else guns and cover with periodic brutal and not martial artsy fisticuffs. They are the ones who will run someone over with a car or tie a car to someone and drive it off a cliff... not the ones who will use grenade bolos.Even Wash who IS a Freelancer was the shittiest of the Freelancers.I do admit that it was a bit disappointing that Carolina didnt get to really strut her stuff but it wasnt a big deal and probably wouldnt have fit the tone of the season. And the shanking basically brought her down to everyone elses level.As for damage potential In all fairness Tex and The Texes may have been pulling her punches which would give a canon reason for Grif still having testicles.,roosterteeth,ckwlkh3,6,t5_2s7g9

2107838,0,t1_cl6y4jj,I think youre massively misunderstanding things. Hes being disallowed from streaming privately he has said nothing to the effect of whether or not hell be streaming on the RT Twitch channel in the future. If he has a personal channel it is automatically built on the foundation of the AH fan base theres just no avoiding that. If he wants to monetize it then hes gonna make money that one could very easily argue is as much AHs revenue as it is his. The only options were either he kept streaming privately and be unable to monetize it or RT starts a Twitch channel monetizes that channel and allows them to build a much larger Twitch fan base and those who stream get a cut of the revenue. I would hazard a guess that Ray wanted to monetize the channel and RT stepped in because he would have been profiting off a fan base that he did not solely build up himself. Obviously his subscribers are fans of him and so theres a degree of ownership that Im sure he felt in that fan base but theyre likely fans of AH and RT at large and thats where the conflicts arise.,roosterteeth,cl7r2kv,1,t5_2s7g9

On top of that they have someone designing custom graphics Photoshop  After Effects etc. which will then be piped through to the ATEM mixer for display.As for software youd want to use. Hmm if youre just starting out Id learn something simpler such as XSplit or OBS. They allow for many custom graphic options and multiple camera options if you have supported capture cards  webcams etc.. Theyre cheap or free in the case of OBS.

In the case of Agatha Christies mysteries the constants were her investigators here it could be the setting of Studio  or even the survivor featuring in the next one.

2499721,0,t1_cmkr6qz,Because it isnt Al Jazeera level journalism doesnt mean we dont want Al Jazeera level coverage.  Sure Fnatic using an illegal boost to change the tide of a match isnt world changing news but it is HUGE news for the CS GO competitive scene. A top team A favorite to win the tournament not only used an illegal boost in a major tournament but also tried to keep the knowledge of the boost a secret.   The Tournament Organizer when faced with the evidence basically just gave Fnatic a slap on the wrist by saying they would have to play the entire match over.   LDLC is now at a disadvantage because Fnatic has seen their tactics for that map while LDLC hasnt seen how Fnatic would normally play on that map. It  sets a precedent for teams to not tell Valve about glitches because the worst thing that could happen for them if they are losing is just having to replay the match.They covered the VAC bans leading up to Dreamhack so they should be familiar with the CS GO scene but they still look and sound like they have no idea what is happening when they talk about it this week.  I dont expect them to be experts on all esports I just want them to sound like theyve done their research on whatever subject it is they are talking about.

2627636,0,t3_2pxu0g,I was a PA guardian last year and the biggest suggestion any guardian will give you is to be honest and dont apply if youre not ready to work. You will be working as early as Wednesday before the event getting there before the hall opens staying after the hall closes working night events etc. if you volunteer full time there is the option to volunteer for only half days be prepared to see very little of the actual convention. the team leads try to give you time to catch a panel or two or get to see booths on the floor but there are no guarantees. Its not always exciting or thrilling work you will probably piss people off when you have to tell them no or correct their actions to follow the rules but at the end of the day its extremely rewarding and an amazing way to connect with the community. Like was mentioned elsewhere do not expect FaceTime with the staff during the event. You may see them more than other attendees but when you wear your guardian shirt you are there to work and they know it. Even as a pa I wasnt automatically friends with the staffers we werent kicking back with drinks and having fun we were working and we are there for the attendees. Let me know if you have any other questions! Ill try my best to answer them or point you in the direction of someone who can. ,roosterteeth,cn1kg2z,2,t5_2s7g9

Searching for game I found literally one person with no thumbs up who said All the gameplay being cut from the video makes this pointless. Might as well just say These were the games RyanJack won. Again he had no thumbs up and theres  comments. This goes with the speculation.

The assassins have to find a way to quietly take down their target either from a distance sniper from above parachute in or stealthily approach and kill close range knifeblunt objectsilenced pistol.With no HUDradar they dont have to call Lester to go invisible like they do in The Most Dangerous Game. Targets can also be limited by not being able to get in a vehicle. Might work as a Things To Do but I can see it becoming a full Lets Play. Lets Play GTA V Gang Wars Lads vs. Gents. Each squad tries to complete as many gang attacks as possible across the map as they can in  minutes one GTA day. Limited to a pistol and a rifle of their choosing sniper assault rifle shotgun etc.. If they cross paths they cannot kill each other. At the end of each gang kill a screen pops up with the number of killsheadshots. Teams get scored on the following  points for a completed gang attack  points for each headshot kill minus points for each player death and a bonus  points at the end for collecting more money from crates or dead gang bangers at the end of the lets play.Team with the most points wins.,roosterteeth,cnyuzyg,3,t5_2s7g9

Instead I jumped three streets and landed at the beach and died. We started to wonder if you could land it so we tried it again and again finding it pretty fun. You are going to want a souped up motorcycle but everything else works to some degree including the Faggio. You can land on buildings on crosswalks in trees and even on people if you hit it correctly. Here is the location of the jump. It can be done in different areas but this is one of the best spots.

The problem with most videos seems to be that the intros are mixed to a different generally higher peak than the actual video. In other words there is no set standard audio level to use between their productions so when they mix and match shit gets fucked. Same seems to be true between their editors since the videos themselves have drastically different levels. ,roosterteeth,co50a0h,3,t5_2s7g9

2968000,0,t3_2u5o64,The best thing for Ray and Rooster Teeth would be for them to allow for him to become a fulltime streamer under their brand.Rooster Teeth despite their YouTube audience still doesnt have a great following on Twitch and dont seem to really care about live streaming that much. I think it would be in both of their best interests because Ray would get to keep a lot of the exposure from being a Rooster Teeth member and RT would get the views and fans from twitch to come over to their other projects for them to work out a way to stick together.The thing that makes me doubt this will happen is the incident with Rays original Twitch channel and how they kinda screwed that up. It makes me think they dont really know how to deal with the streaming market and is also supported by the fact they have done very little livestreaming content from that very channel they took.I do think Ray should be a streamer regardless. He is already great at it and will get better once he goes full time. I just think Rooster Teeth could do a lot more on Twitch and Ray could be a big part of that if they just let him.,roosterteeth,co5h68m,33,t5_2s7g9

3040966,0,t1_cod17y8,Nintendo doesnt have a yearly release cycle. And reusing IPs isnt bad. Its when you remake the same game every year with minor differences thats bad. Nintendo doesnt do that.There were  years between wind waker and twilight princess then  years after that until Skyward Sword and the newest Zelda game doesnt have a release date yet and its . All of those games are vastly different despite all being Zelda games.Mario Kart Wii came out in  the next one wasnt released until . New Super Mario Bros Wii was released in . The sequel didnt get released until . And in between those two standard Mario games we got Super Mario Galaxy the first came out in  and Super Mario D world which are very different from your standard D Mario gamesand also phenomenal games. On top of that each one of those games looks and feels different than the others. Its not like COD where it feels like the same game with a different skin on it.And thats just from the last two consoles. If you go back and look its always been like this. The games may be in the same series but theyre not the same games at all. Thats why Nintendo gets a pass. If you go play Wind Waker and then play Twlight Princess you dont feel like youre playing the same game. If you go play  and Sunshine you dont feel like youre playing the same game. They get a pass because each game in the series is different than the last. ,roosterteeth,cod7197,17,t5_2s7g9

The indiegogo campaign seemed to be to show how involved the fan base is with RT projects which is a good thing to show future investors. RoosterTeeth IS a business with A LOT of employees that need to know that RT has their backs. That means sometimes they will act as a business would and should. Also the so called censoring problem isnt a problem.

3249698,0,t3_2xbc6t,Where I stand with the new thumbnails is that Im not against clickbait as such as it doesnt necessarily mean bad.

Its eye catching but also generic boring and looks like it has been done by a twelve year old. Now this shouldnt bother people as much as it does because its a thumbnail its gone almost as quickly as you see it. However my concern is with what happens next? Poorly designed thumbnails wont kill anything but what happens when they try more things that could actually be harmful.

He deleted his accoutn so I cant even gather how long hed been using it his post history etc.Even if the story is fake it doesnt need to be a whole thing.

Its a nonstory thats being whipped up into a frenzy.I get that Gavin defends himself and I get that Burnie defends him as well. But it still doesnt need to be this thing that its turning into. Burnie is visibly upset that it happened and hes frustrated that he thinks that one person can cause a whole issue but theres no reason for him to be. Even if there are people willing to give up oN RT JUST for the belief Gavin did this thing to this one fan this one time they might not be worth catering to in the first place if theyre that flippant.

3334650,0,t1_cp899q7,Yes and no. It boils down to more personal preference in the end as well what you want to do with the landscape. Sometimes I will just make it in Minecraft and extract it but this is generally only when I need a big landscape in the mountains or plains something that would take much longer to do in Maya.But to give a more simple idea of the benefit of each one Ill make a list.Extract using a programPros Smaller file size. Most programs will only export the visible sides of the blocks which can significantly reduce file size. Better for large landscapes. Like I said before its easier to load a world and just export the giant field than to create it yourself You dont have to create all the models yourself. I have a decent sized library of models now that I have created myself that I use in my animations but you can circumvent this by just using an exporter. The difference is for something like tall grass my model is D isnt just a D image and has a rig setup to have to sway back and forth to add realism you cant have this when it is exportedCons Most programs save the entire export as one giant polygon. When this happens it means you cannot move individual blocks. So to move individual blocks youll have to create them which you wouldve already done had you made the set yourself. It can take much longer if you are using a set that is not just a giant landscape. If you are making a house or something its much easier to do in Maya than Minecraft as you can duplicate and move many blocks at once. Extra work has to be done to get the set to look how you want it to. Every extracting programs different but some will apply different materials to the set. In Maya if I export a scene itll give it the texture material phong which is a shiny material. Normally I use Lambert as it gives it a normal look with no excess shine. So this has to be changed manually for every texture if you want it to look different.Those are the things I can think of just off the top of my head. The list for creating it in the animation program is pretty much the reverse of this so theres really no need to write it all out.Hope this helps if you have any more questions just let me know.,roosterteeth,cp8djmf,6,t5_2s7g9

3339841,0,t3_2yf9kc,The Oceans Eleven portion of Spring Harvest Minecraft LP was amazing and had me in tears the first time I watched it. The last three minutes of King Ryan Part  was incredible and is so important to Ryans MinecraftAH persona. Ryans turn in d Ultra MiniGolf Adventures  Part  was hysterical to the minigolf crew FYI I believe Geoff was three sheets to the wind at that point so he about died laughing. And we cant forget the Cake Wall the first like  minutes of the video.   In the GTA IV Lets Play Part  everyone loved it when Michael got absolutely creamed by Geoff. These two rounds in Cops n Crooks had both the Mob movie excecution and the dump truck getaway while this round was just masterful and the CoOp Lets Play had some awesome moments too. I love a lot of the GTA IV LPs so those are on the list.  In the Rainbox Six Vegas  Lets Play there were plenty of great moments most notably when Gavin ran away in fear when Gavin shot Ray and then Ray looked at Gavins face in his reticule when Gavin threw a grenade at the wall and broke Jack and when Ray quickroped upside down and got killed  There are so many more but those are the ones that I can instantly recall.  ampnbspedit evidently one entire paragraph got removed so I had to add it back again   edit  this thread had some good ones that might fulfill your criteria of uncontrollable laughter.,roosterteeth,cp8yt31,173,t5_2s7g9

3463680,1,t1_cpn1qae,Yeah and they make fun of Jack for being fat but hes not really that fat.  Thats how jokes work they usually involve some exaggeration otherwise youre just being mean.  This is just a strategy to increase youtube numbers and make more money.  Obviously it was a Fullscreen suggestion but whats the problem exactly?Im honestly just laughing over here that all of you think this is a big deal.  You think youve gotten to the bottom of something because small changes are happening after RT got acquired.  You guys are acting like the content is changing when its not.  They just have new people behind them who are actively trying to make the company grow even more than it has on its own.  I know the Funhaus guys are entertaining but thats honestly a much scarier change than something dumb like this.  Its a dangerous precedent to add a completely new group of content creators to your company.  Its all fine right now but what happens when fsrt cares more about the fact that theyre cranking out  lps a day from  different teams than the success of the original LP team.  Now I dont think it will get that out of control but I really dont think the fact that theyre now doing something that pretty much all youtube channels do anyway from the most popular to the least popular is anything we need to worry about.  ,roosterteeth,cpn31o5,-1,t5_2s7g9

3552372,0,t3_30z7yx,Holy shit that animation. Its gorgeous. The lighting on the bridge scenes in particular looked great. Also everyone looks a lot more natural than Season . The fight scenes were great then but sometimes the more subtle body movements were either too stiff or missing but this episode is honestly the best RvB has ever looked. Glad to see Felix and Locus again. Theyre a fantastic pair of characters and Miles and Gray just bounce off each other so well. I cant wait to see where the plot is going to go. Im glad theyre acknowledging a bit more of the proper Halo universe or at least the RvB alternateuniverse version of it with mentions of the aliens and the UNSC. Now I dont know what the official deal is with spoilers on the Sponsor threads so Im just gonna tag this heavier stuff for now unless its fine tbh I think the Sponsor threads should have spoilers off you should really only be in here if youve watched it.spoiler s So the logic part of me is saying that scarface isnt Maine. Id say hed be more fucked up getting tossed off a cliff than just the facial injuries and he would have needed to have the Meta tattoo on the back of his head removed. Also Maines throat was fucked up and this guy only has a facial injury. Now if youre listening closely during the scene where the Counsellor GREAT callback of a character btw is talking about scarface there is the slight hint of the base line of Metas theme music that weird eerie noise that in the full song precedes the guitar notes. What I think this is implying is that scarface will be the one to wear the recovered Meta armor not that he is the Meta. As for his identity I dont really know but someone suggested SharkFace and I think thats a good guess!,roosterteeth,cpx6znm,36,t5_2s7g9

3999362,0,t1_crc4xw6,Thats definitely a factor but the amount of sponsors doesnt match the decline.  Typical GTA videos would get a million views the last three dont even have k.  I noticed the decline recently as well and have been wondering why.  Minecraft views are down as well. I dont think its because  people are tired of GTA or Minecraft since those are still some of the most watched games on YouTube and Twitch as well.  I think its in part because over the past few months the Lets Plays are lacking some creativity and are becoming an AH podcast over the gameplay.As a suggestion I think they should do some of the fun things they do in Things to Do in GTA and use those ideas for Lets Plays.  Sort of using a few Things to Do and make it into Lets Play instead of short videos on their own.  And have the GTA Lets Plays styled like the early GTA IV videos.,roosterteeth,crc5qgu,5,t5_2s7g9

4040614,0,t3_36r7wa,So Im subscribed to both Funhaus and Lets Play and love them both. Honestly I think the Lets Play channel featuring Funhaus AND  Achievement Hunter could work but I think a slight change needs to be made. Funhaus has its own channel. Achievement Hunter does not. Honestly this channel has strayed pretty far from simply doing Lets Plays Go Vs. etc. I think a great solution would be to keep this channel reserved for Lets plays from any of the RT staff including Funhaus while simultaneously creating a channel for solely achievement Hunter. I miss quite a few of the Things to Do and Achievement Hunt videos simply because Im not subscribed to Roosterteeth. Consolidating all of Achievement Hunters stuff into one channel like Funhaus currently and using the lets play channel for solely Lets plays featuring any RT staff and collaboration videos would be a really simple way of broadening the viewership of all of Roosterteeths content.,roosterteeth,crguznp,2,t5_2s7g9

To put it nicely hes said some very hurtful ignorant and unkind things and when you voice your unkind opinions expect to reap what you sow.   Im sure NBC has some kind of morality clause or clause that states that their clients and partners should do nothing that jeopardizes the public opinion of NBC. If this is the case its well within NBCs rights to terminate any and all contracts with Trump because frankly they arent very nice opinions and have caused him a lot of business problems in the past and obviously at the present. And if he had these kinds of clauses in his contracts with NBC or NBC just plain and simple had the option to terminate any contracts without notification and at will and still said these kinds of things Id call him an idiot for walking on that thin ice knowing hed probably fall in.,roosterteeth,csn9ofu,9,t5_2s7g9

4769543,0,t1_ctvq6sx,But the reason why people are getting turned away is because people are loafing around.  Which is why my first proposed solution was to basically punish the loafers until they learn that its not a good idea to loaf around.Theyve already made efforts to give attendees a chance to see popular panels by scheduling them to conflict with one another this is an opinion since what you want to see might not be the same as someone else.  Their onehour rule was probably to give everyone including the walkins a chance to see a panel they want.  It only becomes a lottery because a lot of people had the same idea to try and get in line before the designated time.  My first proposal was to break that habit.Honestly at this point Im pretty sure that the only reasons they changed it was because of safety issues fire codes regarding the hotels and because the higherups honestly felt that there are better things to do at a convention than spend hours waiting in a line.  Going by what theyve said on the podcast in the past they dont really get line culture.  Neither do I apparently since I honestly cannot comprehend how the guardians can manage two lines for two separate events happening at the same room if I remember correctly the guardians were swamped and people actually complained about them.The idea of fast passes is to compliment the old system of first come first served.  Its for people that could spend the money but not the time to get into a panel.  Ive seen it at smaller conventions and it did stem people from lining up early they still did but not as many of them.,roosterteeth,ctvqstt,1,t5_2s7g9

5091556,0,t3_3kolvq, So as soon as I realized the story was looking pretty good I watched a playthrough without any commentary that saved everyone then did a bit of investigating to see how you could kill characters and then I came back and watched the AH playthrough because I knew theyd miss a bunch of the story.So coming in I figured theyd Spoilers kill Matt because he is pretty easy to kill you have to disagree with Em and have Em give him the flare. Not only did they agree with Em but never even found the flare gun. But I thought for sure theyd be able to save the rest of the characters.But boy was I wrong. They managed to Spoilers kill Chris despite not shooting Ash when theyre tied to chairs if this happens Ash doesnt let Chris back in after the flamethrower guy dies and Chris gets his head ripped off. They also managed to kill Ash by not only leaving Chris behind a choice they totally glossed over but also by investigating the sound which are two consecutive horrible choices haha. Theres only like one place Sam can die and they did it which prevented them from getting the only option where Mike can die. Jess should also have been fairly easy to save because they didnt fuck up during Mikes rescue which meant she didnt die immediately upon finding her at the elevator.Im curious to see if theyll play the last bit again and look for a few more clues Spoilers If they find the journal confirming what Michael thought that  Hannah ate Beth and became a Wendigo then Josh doenst get killed because he calls out Hannahs name but then turns into a Wendigo himself ,roosterteeth,cuzq33j,3,t5_2s7g9

Im sorry to hear about your suspension but maybe you can use this time to better yourself. Maybe get a job to keep you busy and save up money and find ways to fight your depression.

They then call him out for including in his review the bugs he encountered and saying it was a technical messEven if it isnt them shitting on him solely they did act like he was some elitist snob for giving an honest review.

Im a guy in my later s who plays gameswatches movies and my friends are all pretty similar  a big target demographic for RT basically  and we all still buy gamesBlurays. And we all live innear St. Louis and have aboveaverage internet Mbps down. There are a ton of people who dont have access to internet services even close to that speed. Why would I want to switch to digital media when A even with my internet speeds it takes forever to download a game and B you never actually own digital media.

If you have any more ideas or criticisms please leave them in the comments and keep in mind that this is only my second video Ive edited.Thanks for watching! Edit I also used this as a music syncing exercise. The music in the Resiviour Dogs scene was dubbed over with the same music and I cut the original mostly out. Counter intuitive but it helped me hone my skills with syncing music. Resiviour Dogs played the music at about . speed. I recommend something like that as an exercise. Edit Edit People seem to be responding fairly positive to this so I guarantee there will be more! I am taking everyones criticism and ideas to heart so hopefully the future videos will always be better then the last! Also yes I love Tarantino movies. You might have been able to tell.

6338559,0,t3_42gd1q,ThoughtsIm glad negative things are finally happening to the cast both to Yang a few episodes back and now to Ruby and Pyrrha. Adversity and negative experiences generally produce the best character development in a story and its been sorely lacking for most of the history of the show. On that same note I somewhat hope Penny is actually dead dead and doesnt get to magically survive cuz shes a robot nothing reflecting on whether I like or dislike her character but if shes suddenly fine again in a few episodes or at the end of the season itll feel hollow and doesnt make for good storytelling.I havent really felt a need to care about Pennys death. The show tells me that shes Rubys friend but shes had such limited screentime that I dont really have any attachment to her as a character. Obviously the members of Team RWBY have plot armor but if another more prominent character were to meet a similar fate it would probably be more effective.How on Earth did no one else recognize Emerald last episode? Surely at least one schmuck in the crowd had to have gone hey thats that lady that was with Mercury didnt she go home? rather than Ruby being the only person to spot her from across a stadium no less.,roosterteeth,cza4gsb,16,t5_2s7g9

6424504,0,t1_czjifr4,To an extent I guess. I felt like the Jet Pack thing was never going to work based on how they did itthey should have just used a crane with some wires to simulate so they could have their hands free and I assume they were paid to do a Battlefront Immersion and they came up with the Jet Pack part because theres really not much else to do.The Metal Gear Box thing though is barely a test because they used the games rules. If the point of the show was to test that game mechanic in the real worldlike most of the old Immersions were then they need to relate it to the real world with real world rules. That test was just them recreating and playing the game in real life because using the games own rules to determine how it would work doesnt test if its actually a viable strategy in real life. If it were up to me I would have had the guards NOT be in on itwith rules to report or investigate anything strange and then had the cardboard box thing happen to see. However the simple fact that they would have to know they were being filmed they would most likely be more attentive to strange occurrences. Although guards in general should be anyway so who knows.Overall though I think both tests were just put together because they had the game they needed to test first and then came up with something later. Not that it wasnt entertaining but to me its no longer Immersion but its dumber flashier cousin.,roosterteeth,czjtwwo,2,t5_2s7g9

The Funhaus one was weird because I didnt know there was any anniversary and it made it odd to differentiate betweeen FH and RT video links with that CSS and the Lazer Team one I didnt expect to be back so soon I guess in honor of the YT Red launch.  So to me it just seemed like there was a rotating list of themes the sub switched to every day or so.I do think the best possible thing to do would be to allow people to use whichever theme they prefer or just stick to each theme for a longer period of time.

7138501,0,t1_d1pjvcf,A group of youtubers who took heavy inspiration from roosterteeth in their early days. They have recently decreased their gameplay video output in favour for more live action adventures similar to the ahdventures which has met with controversy among the fan base but not because of the quality mind but because of the lack of what brought them to the creatures in the first place. On the topic of the fan base they are quite toxic as they seem to hate the entire group except Alex James and Aaron. However the entire group can be great in my opinion. Although the group itself is quite unstable as many have left some with negative feelings but most have since put aside their differences.Edit Grammar and spelling Would also like to add that James and Alexs play though of battle lock theatre is one of my favourite video game playthroughs on youtubers I would highly recommend it. Its a little jarring watching it now though as it was back when they first started making videos together and they call each other by their usernames occasionally instead of their real names.And I believe they did a gta v video in the past with funhaus you can check out but I dont think I ever watched so I couldnt say if it was a good representation of the group. ,roosterteeth,d1pkjad,93,t5_2s7g9

But particularly in the last couple of months I really feel like she has gone beyond that. She offers more stories and non punvulgar comments. She still absolutely contributes those which we love her for but she has definitely been growing as well. Diversity in the podcast...cast...is of course awesome. New people and stories and perspectives are always welcome and great. But Barbara I feel like at least has really been rising to the task lately. And from my perspective people are focusing solely on what she has always been doing instead of seeing what she has been doing differently.That being said I still think your criticism is absolutely valid. And I agree with it again to an extent. I just feel like she deserves a little more credit. She has been growing as an actor and creative contributor for a while but I really feel like  is the Year of Creative Barbara.

7590314,0,t1_d34ttew,Ill admit that Ive only read the introduction page Ill get to the rest tomorrow its a fucking novel but there are always two or more sides to every story. To be honest I know plenty of people who have left companies Ive worked for and I know exactly why they left or were termd and later when I hear the story from them its completely different.When people are in the wrong or behaving like children or making mistakes the history they present about their departure from a company tends to be exceedingly revisionist in nature. They may not be outandout lying but they spend a lot of time mulling over the situation putting a lot of personal spin on different events and inserting a ton of their own personal melodrama into the retelling of the tale.Based on my own limited understanding of RT as a company  garnered exclusively by watching their content for years i.e. secondhand  Shanes account of events doesnt mesh. I dont know what the truth is in any of it but I think penning your manifesto to try and spite your former coworkers is unbelievably childish and unnecessary. If you have professional problems deal with them in a professional manner and preferably in private  assuming those problems dont involve harassment or the breaking of laws. This dirty laundry airing only serves to bring a lot of anger and divisiveness into what should otherwise be a happy family of RT fans.,roosterteeth,d34zcad,9,t5_2s7g9

These discussions belong wherever they are brought up. If you dont like it then thats your problem.

The only reason shitty people do what they do on the internet is to see a reaction and because of anonymity so they dont see actual consequences. She reacted in a BIG way and that was the worst possible thing to do. People see that it clearly bothers her and they want to see her that way. She gave them literally what they wanted.Of course its not right for people to act like that but shitty people will do whatever they want. And of course Im not saying she doesnt have the right to say anything about it but seriously the best you can do is wait for some to stop. All of the negative comment trends weve seen on videos in the past have come down to a trickle simply because RTAH never really acknowledge them.If Mica does that and silently bans or blocks a handful at a time some the shitty people doing it are going to get bored and move on to their next target. And every day itll be a few more moving on. There will always be a few around because you cant get rid of it entirely but itll get way easier to manage.

On the other hand at least the central conceits revealed by the ten minute mark so I dont think Id been majorly spoiled.On the same note though Im really glad I didnt watch the character shorts that they released beforehand  I just went back and looked at them and I much preferred those moments as they unfolded in the film. I guess theres something of a tension between effective promotion and packing as much punch as possible up front but...The only other point of disconnect is that I feel like the plane should have been visibly damaged at least a little  that shook me out of the moment.There were a few sliiiightly hammy lines but the actors were universally awesome. The music direction was absolutely spot on. There were some great shots the sense of emptiness was really effectively done.

The only big change is the loot box style premium sub model. Right now though sponsors dont really lose anything except a few extra dollars every six months and people have the option to pay more to get more.So in the short term its not a big deal in the long term it depends how much double gold sponsors get compared to regular sponsors. That said considering the price of Double Gold I doubt theyll do anything in terms of exclusive content for that tier I imagine it will be more a merch and event priority thing. I might give it a try for a little bit depends if they have a shorter sub period than six months and whether it costs more if youre not in the US.Ultimately my biggest problem is that the name is a bit shit.,roosterteeth,d4re3fs,1,t5_2s7g9

I never want to discourage anyone from pursuing something they would enjoy but I hope people who live and work in the U.S. understand that if they make more than  a year from Twitch they have to file taxes properly as they are considered an independent contractor and selfemployed.Also donations are not considered gifts. It is still considered income. Twitch streamers must account for every donation that is processed. It is the equivalent of waiters getting tipped  that is still income and must be processed on your tax return as such.,roosterteeth,d4tetv4,3,t5_2s7g9

Many conventions mail out passes so there are situations to look at to solve or even prevent any potential issues. Rooster teeth just had  plus backers who are going to receive million dollars but through the mail and not only that but they ship orders from the rooster teeth store on a daily basis. They destroyed their goals for lazer team and MDB have a healthy community of sponsors and are even partnered with full screen.

8194263,0,t1_d51lah1,I would like to disagree. I mean there is indeed a degree of forcing and acting it out but I see that as the form of entertainment that they do. Of course if they man up they can probably have no reaction at all but whats the fun in that? Just a bunch of stoic people sitting on a couch. Sure if you want real reactions not everything they do will suit your taste. But a small suspension of disbelief will make it go a long way. Theyre entertainers they do their best to entertain the viewers and sometimes that asks for exaggeration. But I expect them to be real! Its a podcast not one of their shorts! I understand this sentiment. Its the beauty of this podcast to have a peek in their lives and see how relatable they are but I also see myself acting silly or exaggeration something to make it more fun. I mean I wont dissuade you of hating this segment its just such a strong word with little nuance. I just hope you also understand how people like it Like most funny stuff on the internet only make me breath out a little bit louder and flare my nostrils but something like their reactions actually make me laugh out loud and applaud gleefully.A good example I like to use are Japanese game shows do you think theyre funny? And what about after they are adapted into western shows? Silent library comes to mind the Japanese game shows have professional comedians as contestants who have exaggerated reactions and play out the games. In the western shows youve got actual contestants or in the case of Italy bikini models who just try their best in a pretty easy game. I mean something like Ninja Warrior is entertaining to see people try their best in. But something like youd like to see howd they react to horrible stuff without actually being horrible. Its a bit like Schadenfreude and youre glad you dont have to go through it and laugh at others suffering without it being cruel and without them actually suffering. But eh. care,roosterteeth,d51u28r,7,t5_2s7g9

8231928,0,t1_d56ebou,Fanfic is a very different culture from general fan type stuff. I always stand by the fact that if its public then its free game and may be met with criticismThey had a discussion on how fanfictions are treated in the FunHaus FanHaus. The perspective given from the other side is that unlike fan art that tends to go up on Twitter Reddit etc. the artist usually wants their art to be seen by those they are making it of as homage to them. They put it in a public space in hopes of having the person in question eventually see it. Fanfic isnt necessarily the same case. The stories written though public is put out in a space more accepting and tailored for the piece written and isnt necessarily meant for the person they were writing about. Its meant for themselves and the audience they are writing for. Lawrence said on the episode that by having the person who was written about actually read the story itself seems almost disingenuous because of conflicts that the person in question may feel with their own personality and personality of their written counterpartMy thought on why fanfiction authors were so up in arms about the Free Play episode is that fanfic authors feel more persecuted than other fan works because of the stigma surrounding it which is why they seek refuge in sites like Tumblr Fanfiction.net Ao etc. When made public by rather well known people whom were written about it opens them up for unwanted attention and critisism from people that might not understand the motives behind the story created,roosterteeth,d56jpgg,16,t5_2s7g9

8518073,0,t1_d65x0xi,I think a big part of it too was the change from a weekly schedule on the AH channel. When that happened they said itd be so they could focus more on making what they want to make instead of having to make certain series because they have a schedule. But it turned out that they ended up just making a few series way too much especially Five Facts notice how there was at least one FF per week whereas they stopped making some of the viewers favorite series for weeks or months on end VS and Go! come to mind. It felt and still to an extent feels extremely lazy. Most of the videos they put out now are just variations on Lets Plays Play Pals is LP with just  people Lets Watch is a LP in a single player game etc instead of having other series that keep it feeling fresh and interesting. Dont get me wrong I really enjoy the AH content currently. I think Jeremy is a great addition to the crew to replace Ray but I completely agree with the idea that their overreliance on ingame minigames instead of creative new ideas in GTA and Minecraft has kind of lead to a downturn in the quality of those series. I personally believe they should stop both of them or at least make them biweekly or something less often so what they do put out feels less forced.It might also have to do with the fact that theyve bitten off way more than they can chew with all of the series they have to do and other projects they work on within RT so what they make often feels rushed. ,roosterteeth,d66bifk,7,t5_2s7g9

Its a valid criticism. Mindy is quite possibly the worst character in cinema history shes stupid has no arc and exists purely for Michael to fawn over because of her looks.

8575330,0,t3_4x84ic, Last time around  I spoke about tipsThis time around Ill speak about defenses.  In  days to die there are a few defensive things you can build to keep zombies out.  You can build walls trenches and spikes.  The basic two are the wood spike What the boys are using now and log spikes can be upgraded a total of five times.  There are also things like barbed wire and fencing and the like but they are not resource efficient right now so lets get down to our spikes.  Wood spikes are easy to make a good way to level up misc crafting and something you can easily build and use  off during the first days to make triple thick walls that can defend any prefab during the first week.  They are also useful if you get stuck away from your base at night and duck into a store or other POI Point of interest aka a building by tossing a quick all around layer around the building so an individual zombie cant spend the night breaking a wall down to get at you.  They are best used at least two deep and dont count on them to stop   days hordes which have enough bodies to work they way through even a five deep wall of spikes.  The later game defense is the log spike three deep in a trench or on the ground with a little lip so zombie crawlers can crawl over the spikes take damage and die.  They can be upgraded with wood then again with metal several times and walking on them causes you to start bleeding pretty reliably in addition to the spike damage so keep bandages handy.  But wood spikes three deep fully upgraded with a nice reinforced concrete wall can stop a horde of almost any size... however later game   days in may have enough zombies to completely cover the spikes in dead zombie bodies so never just have one wall.  Build a wall line it with spikes then inside that wall dig down Easier or dig up and build a blockhouse you can retreat to if your wall is breached.  Speaking of walls...Defense in days to die consists of a  block high wall with an overhang to prevent spider zombies from climbing over your wall and you accidentally falling off it.  Building walls  blocks high is best to prevent easy body ramping since a  block high wall can be climbed over if the corpses stack up enough at the base of your wall.  One of the best ways to avoid this is to move around to prevent the entire nights horde from attack the same spot this can be done as simplly as running to a different section of wall and shooting the horde to the complex having a secondary base exit so you can shoot into the horde drag them away from the wall and return to your base via the second exit.  Thats enough for now like Ive said before  days to die is a fun game and defending against zombies is interesting but Ill end it here.OhPSIf you dont like fighting zombies?  Fight a nice deep natural cave hordes cant frigging find you if your at bedrock or lost in a windy cave they Devs have promised to fix it sooner or later but now zombie pathing is not up to finding you in a cave they will try to dig to you but again natural caves are big so just move deeper into the cave.... also caves typically have other caves nearby so if they do manage to dig  blocks strait down to you then just move to the next cave over.  Its kind of lame but for now it works.  ,roosterteeth,d6dhz87,29,t5_2s7g9

The moments where he gets most pissed off in a video are when hes trying to do something technical and somebody screws with him to be funny. Michael Gavin and Geoff all prefer to entertain than to play well. Being in an uncomfortable position where everyone else wants you to act a certain way and is acting that certain way has a way of magnifying feelings of animosity.I think Rays Youtube channel is one of the bigger indicators that Rays attitude towards content is completely different to AH. Ray doesnt edit his videos nor does he make it a priority of his. He doesnt want to constantly perform in front of a camera he just wants to play and have people watch and maybe occasionally do something funny or meme about something. At the end of the day Ray doesnt care if his videos are good in retrospect he just wants to play games and communicate with an audience while doing so.,roosterteeth,d7skk9d,13,t5_2s7g9

Especially as we have  LPs building up to this already.Because while the drive and talk LPs are fun AH is becoming increasingly dependent on them to the point that I spend more time with AH on in the background while I play a game.  And most are nowhere near as entertaining as this ones buildup. So I can easily see the people who want a visual component to their youtubes getting annoyed.Part of it is AH giving us what we want and probably needing to start adjusting in the other direction. And the other is just the nature of youtubes monetization scheme and the benefits of longer videos in that regard.,roosterteeth,da06bum,18,t5_2s7g9

If the writing is good the characters are believable and everything else works  the audience will get over the weirdness of the world pretty quickly and enjoy the film regardless of how goofy it can look.  The problem is if it sucks and totally misses the mark of what made Ghost in the Shell good in the first place then all the goofiness will just sit at the surface and further ruin the movie.,roosterteeth,da16n5d,1,t5_2s7g9

9744855,0,t3_5eoond,Mica obviously has strong feelings about this and is gonna take the hard stance but I think the overarching point they kept coming back to can be summarized by this point from Hasan Minhaj on the Daily Show I dont hate you I just dont care about you.People who voted for Trump cant have possibly thought that Trump would be a better candidate for issues such as social equality tolerance and progression. Worse than that he more or less advocated for regression in those fields. And for people that say that he didnt actually mean any of those things he said why should we take anything else he said seriously as well? If people voted for him truly believing that he would solve our economic issues Im going to take him at his word. That includes all the sexist racist and homophobic dialogue as well. It comes with the package.To me being that openly discriminatory to so many different groups of people should be immediately disqualifying as someone meant to be the figurehead of the US.

9784228,0,t1_daj3wff,gtI know. They should thats the point.I would love to know what expertise you have in the subject that would lend this recommendation of yours any weight. It is a special kind of arrogance that presumes that you know better than the people who devote their lives to the research of these topics.gt As the video says the answer is therapy not acceptance.When you have a professional body of psychiatrists and psychologists saying one thing about this and some bigoted hack video on youtube saying another I know whose opinion I respect more.gtSaying they need help is the exact opposite of shaming them.No it isnt. Its a form of shaming that rather patronisingly affords you the high ground to preach down to them about all thats wrong with them in order to exhort them to go and fix themselves. All this when you have no evidential ground or credentials for saying any of this.gtYou wouldnt be happy for a clinically depressed person either youd get them help.All of what youre writing relies on the premise that gender noncomformity somehow ought to be treated as mental illness. Again you have demonstrated zero basis for why anyone ought to take you seriously when you say this. What is your expertise? What firsthand research have you done into this area? I am quite happy to wager that the answer is none whatsoever on both counts.gtExplain to me why transgenders are so much more likely to commit suicide after transitioning?Because of the social stigma that still exists and is propogated by people such as yourself.gtThe easy answer is your bigotted insult hereBigotry requires prejudice something in which you are indulging in spades but which I am not guilty of here or anywhere else  I judged you at face value on the basis of the comments that you posted up here for other people to scrutinise. What you said very readily demonstrated your idiocy and I am quite content to say so.,roosterteeth,daj4b1q,11,t5_2s7g9

9790275,0,t1_daju38u,gtOk as for the singular they thats absolutely fair but it is used when the gender is unknown.It is also used when referring to someone who is nonbinarygtThis person has to have a gender I just am asking what it is.In Vals case they are gender fluidgtI am trying to find something here I can wrap my head around because it has to be one or the other I dont care which one. I just am confused.I may have begun a little harsh.Your gender is your identity separate from your sex which is biological. Its a complicated psychological mechanism which can be based on masculinityfemininity but also on nonbinary traits.There are more than two genders. Not all people agree but in this conversation this is a relevant perception. Some people do not feel either male or female and some people will feel both alternately or simultaneously. Because it is complicated to ask a genderfluid person how they feel at they moment many choose they because neither he nor she will be right.It is difficult to perceive gender when you are cis but I find it helps to consider everything about you that matches your body but is not physically your body. If you are cis you may be able to get a sense of your gender identity as the mentality that conforms to how society identifies you. Other people feel something completely different.,roosterteeth,dajv4js,3,t5_2s7g9

10097411,0,t1_dbnozf6,GTA is certainly multi genre. And CEO missions are squarely in the PvP genre. If you want to do races there are races with no PvP whatsoever. If you want to fly planes you can easily do that without any player contact. If you choose to pick the game mode that clearly states that its a PvP mission where other players are trying to stop you from completing your objective you have no one to blame but yourself when you end up in a PvP mission where other players are trying to stop you from completing your objective. People dont need to get money for it. I personally enjoy driving motorbikes in the desert when I play GTA. I dont get anything out of it except enjoyment. Many other people enjoy shooting people and blowing things up. That doesnt make them trolls. That makes them people who play one of the games many genres of game modes exactly as its intended. Notice that not a single person killed them or even came near them until they started the mission. In fact Michael was killed a completely innocent did who just happened to drive by in the first video. Does that make him an asshole and a troll?

10098221,0,t3_5ke2jt,Things that the team should know Special Vehicles are called from the Vehicles Section of the Interaction Menu. Theres a  minute cooldown for balance reasons which is fine but it doesnt start until your current vehicle is destroyed and you cant call another special vehicle when one is already out which is dumb and stupid. KITT the Rocket Voltic Ramp Buggy and BlazerTechnical Aqua are customisable at any Los Santos Customs. So yes you can have a Chromed MGAR KITT if you want. Or a Pink one in Geoffs case. Angling the nose of the Rocket Voltic determines the direction you go when the boost is activated in midair. Drop it from a cargobob and angle the nose up and activate the boost? You should rocket back into the sky or into the cargobob that dropped you. Geoff ended up nose down when he hit the boost hence why the car went almost straight back down. Also activating in midair tends to result in more air time than activating on a ramp as Geoff was doing. Heres an example The Voltic was angled slightly right on the ramp when the boost was activated so it speared right instead. KITT has unlimited parachutes.,roosterteeth,dbnt9hx,76,t5_2s7g9

I mean I assume its not like Jeremy can just record himself playing a game for an hour and just upload it to the ah channel himself without asking anybody. But thats basically what ray did. He made an account with the name roosterteeth on a site that they dont use and was essentially forcing rt to selfcompete with itself as some people probably just didnt watch the days lets play in favor of watching rays stream while rt benefited nothing from it because they didnt make any money from twitch.

10503591,0,t1_dcy7w5j,Theres actually been a few cases like that in the legaladvice subreddit lately.I saw one where a guy convinced a girl to have the baby hoping it would keep them together. She then handed it over ensured she didnt have custody and left. He was trying to get legaladvice to force her to be with him they all gave him the advice of you cant do anything about it she made it clear youre fucked and you deserve it.On the other hand I saw one where a guy wanted to raise the kid on his own but the woman wanted to have it adopted by somebody else  she didnt want the kid but she specifically didnt want him to have it either. Legaladvice had two things to say on that one  firstly once its born he can adopt it and take full custody of it without her if he wants. Secondly dont pressure her about it because she could have an abortion instead and theres nothing he could do about it.So two sides of the coin there  theres the ugly side of men trying to force women to have kids so they will stay with and theres the ugly side of women wanting to have an abortion when the man would want to raise it with sole custody.Really a complicated issue.,roosterteeth,dcyoz4n,9,t5_2s7g9
10503935,0,t1_dcym039,gt and with women being the primary caregivers over men in most families theyre also the ones that take time off to take care of their kids.And some of that is actually a mens rights issue. Did you know in sweden men can get equal time off work to women when theyve had a kid? Seems pretty sensible to me.. two people can help handle a new baby much better than  and hey equality. Its not supposed to be a fucking prize for giving birth. Theyve had a baby.Not only that they also have much longer mandatory paid time off than the US or the UK or Jersey where I live.The thing is a lot of the social issues are pretty complex and just arent brought up. There are people who genuinely believe that women make c to the dollar in the workplace. That isnt factually correct.Theres also the fact that men do more dangerous labour and that theres a huge negative stigma attached to skilled trades but men are forced into that. The focus should be on removing negative stigma from things women could do that have high pay and on encouraging men to take a fucking break from the workplace now and then. But it isnt. Its women get paid less than men with the optional qualifying info of because they dont get higher paid jobs with the solutions generally being things like hiring ratios not goals for actual social change to fix it in the long run.,roosterteeth,dcyqdrw,22,t5_2s7g9

Ive gotten emails from his friends his football club his bank an online store his former university you name it. I know so much about that guy now. Its kinda depressing to see how much he accomplished in comparison to me lol..Its been going on for at least two or three years now. Whenever I get a personal email intended for him like an email thats obviously sent by a person and not a machine I send an email back that they have the wrong person and that they should inform the guy to pay attention to his email adress whenever he gives it out.

I have to say i couldnt disagree more.I would put him as battling with Geoff in terms of doing the worst job at this point of playing his character.gtHe was appalled that Ryan stole the gem and stated many times that he wanted nothing to do with Ryans fuck up.Never said otherwise but that doesnt explain his actions come the dragons arrival and in fact makes his character less consistent up and to this point when he is willing to set aside his religious conviction for partying up with Bo and acting like theres no way around the matter and selling out another party member ryan so transparently. gtAlso I think youre being too harsh on all the membersYou have no basis for that conclusion because the only  playing poorly are Geoff and Gus and Geoff has at least an understandable reason for his failings.Geoff is convinced that comedy is the key and without it everything he does will fall apart and viewers will be lost etc. He is incorrect in concluding thats why people are watching this show but at least it explains his actions. Everyone else is doing excellently. gtI just dont really get why everyone is so annoyed with the rest of the cast for shitting on Albus. Theyre all either Good or Neutral characters Albus is the only one thats evil. Albus is Neutral rather obviously so and anyone who thinks stealing items in DampD is evil is delusional. I feel like youre missing a lot or drawing a lot of erroneous conclusions. gtand he has to accept that people arent gonna really trust him.Except he shouldnt have to its an irrational and nonsensical conclusion that he is someone not someone the party can trust. He has been the most steadfastly dependable party member by no small margin. Its like you didnt even listen to his explanations in the show or muted it while Ryan was speaking.

11537994,0,t1_dg3e4ca,I mean they are prioritizing the  people that would be interrupted if the crew did not show up over the  people in Chicago that got removed.  Pretty simple math and fully covered by the carrier agreement one agrees to when purchasing a ticket. Also the value might seem low but the reason they likely didnt go higher was because that is the max they are obligated to pay when they bump someone that doesnt volunteer. They are required to pay x the fare or  whichever is cheaper. Go look up flights from OHare to Louisville on Uniteds website a week or two out and youll see the price of the flight is right around . In hindsight it obviously wasnt the right call based on how the guy wound up getting removed from the plane but at the time it seemed like the correct call.Is it morally or ethnically questionable? Sure. Illegal? No. Involuntary bumping has been happening on airplanes for quite a while. I think the average is  per day per carrier. Only reason this got so big is because the guy refused and the police really did a number on the guy in the process.  ,roosterteeth,dg3u139,-8,t5_2s7g9

11627638,1,t1_dgdyycg,But his scale of maturity can include an appreciation for dick and poop jokes but perhaps doesnt extend to breaking things.And example of how this is likely is that as an adult who pays for his own things he can find him and his friends making  a dick joke funny while being immature so while it is an immature level of humour its relatable so Im sure he agrees its immature in a sense it isnt entirely different.Whereas watching someone breaking things his adult self looks at it and says why are you doing that it isnt yours it costs money.,roosterteeth,dge072k,-3,t5_2s7g9
