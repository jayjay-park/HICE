You can deposit or withdraw any pokemon you want at one explained away by a series of pnumeotubes that transit protoballs around the island youre on. Convenience no sacrificing anything but also plotrelated change. Id also suggest that because normally any pokemon after your th in party is transferred automatically that the bag have a PkMn Storage pocket  this would act as a single pokemon box allowing you to keep a short list of pokemon you want on you swapping them out or depositing them to make space at the box houses.

He was upset since his mom also played it.Another one is the same first mentioned friend. We were at school playing and the teachers had had a discussion on whether we should be allowed to play during recess. So a teacher came and turned off the GameBoyC and he started crying.The last one is also from a school recess. I was sitting on a swing playing. It has just rained so there was a puddle under me I managed to drop my GameBoyC into it and panicked yelling Pick it up! Pick it up!

36988,0,t3_1ui3r4,Im surprised this hasnt come up yet... but Pokemon has always stressed the importance of making facetoface connections and sharing with friends. As this is the first truly online generation they clearly put more effort into providing players with alternative means of connecting beyond just wondertrade forever. The PSS allows you to see when another player is physically nearby its a perfect ice breaker for actual social interaction. The differences between passersby acquaintances and friends force you to think of other players as more than just a random name and avatar.In addition pokemon is about inclusivity. Everyone should be able to play without being subjected to profanity regardless of age or ethnicity. The only real suggestions i could propose on these fronts is to make the ingame chat toggle more visible and adding as others have said an emoticon system for trades.,pokemon,cein52x,1,t5_2qmeb

Bw protag became a movie startook down almost every gym leader and took down every championconquered a flying ship that was powered by kyuremcaught maybe more legendariesand fought  legendaries fused togetherdepending on the version of game.

82376,0,t1_cenpdbg,gt but if you had a strategy where say a Golem gets hit with a Hyper Beam from a Dragonite and plans to kill it while it recharges you cant do that because Golem and Dragonite are in separate tiers. You cant use your favorites against others favorites most of the time because a group of elitists said so.Um you do know how the tiering works right? Pokemon considered higher up cannot play in the lower tiers but the lower tiers can play any tiers higher than its own. You could totally play anyway you want to in the Uber tier. Nobody is preventing you from doing that. Smogon is just saying that unless you have a great strategy chances are you and your team is going to lose a majority of the time. And losing usually isnt very fun.A lot of people like Smogons system because it makes the most sense and allows for the greatest amount of luck to be taken out of the game. Even VGC doesnt allow certain moves in the game like Fissure because it fundamentally doesnt lead to good competition and they ban all legendaries regardless of how good or bad they are. After rereading the rules I found for the next year only about ish of the  are permissible in the  VGC. Why? Who knows.Again Im not defending all of Smogons decisions. Im just saying that they didnt come up with their battling rules because they thought it would make them Smogon great Pokemon trainers. Its what they think can be the most competitive system.gt Thing is if you win in an unofficial tournament its often not considered a legit win if you dont use Smogons system.Its not Smogon has been around forever enforcing their rules. Hell you can download the Showdown emulator and modify it to enforce your own rules if you wish. Most standards have to start somewhere and if youre really serious about it now is as good a time as any.,pokemon,cent2g7,3,t5_2qmeb

151558,0,t3_1vqqjr,Ill probably end up posting this in rStunfisk here in a day or two but I thought Id ask my question here first.Ive had a Speed Boost MegaBlaziken a member of my semicompetitive team since a month after the game came out but its been banned in OU by Smogon and I dont want to piss anyone off by using it...so I need something to replace my Blaziken.  Im also looking to revamp my team because Ive been using it for quite some time now and its starting to be less effective due to the influx of PokeBank mons.  Anyways Ill lay out my team so you have an idea of what youre working with.  Id love any input and if there are Pokemon you think should be removedadded let me know.  Anyways heres my teamBlaziken aka Yip Kaiman wBlazikenite  Ability Speed Boost  EVs  HP   Att   Spe  Jolly Nature   HiJump Kick   Flare Blitz   Protect   Swords Dance  Baton Pass  Azumarill wMystic WaterChoice Band  Ability Huge Power  EVs  HP   Att   Spe  Adamant Nature   Aqua Jet   Superpower   Play Rough   Return  Aqua Tail  Ferrothorn aka Gluttony wLeftovers  Ability Iron Barbs  EVs  HP   Def   SDef  Relaxed Nature   Stealth Rock  Spikes   Leech Seed   Thunder Wave   Power Whip  Garchomp aka Blas wLife OrbLum Berry  Ability Sand Veil  EVs  HP   Att   Spe  Adamant Nature   Earthquake   Outrage   Swords Dance   Stone Edge  RotomW aka Maytag wLum Berry  Chesto Berry  Ability Levitate  EVs  HP   Att   Def  Bold Nature    Volt Switch   Hydro Pump   WillOWisp   Rest  Gengar aka PsychoManiac wBlack Sludge  Ability Levitate  EVs  HP   SpA   Spe  Timid Nature   Substitute   Shadow Ball   Focus Blast   WillOWisp So yeah thats my team.  I realize Jolly Garchomp might have been more effective than Adamant but I bred for adamant and Ive been too lazy to go back and rebreed a Jolly one.  I might get around to that if I overhaul my team.  Anyways what should I use to replace MegaBlaziken?  I was thinking about Infernape but Im not sure if thats a good idea.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.,pokemon,cevozjq,1,t5_2qmeb

166844,0,t1_cexe6ye,Whenever you encounter or hatch a pokemon certain aspects of it are randomized.  One aspect is the pokemons Individual Values IVs.  Each pokemon has  IVs corresponding to each stat  HP Attack Defense Special Attack Special Defense and Speed.  IVs range from  to .  The higher the IV the higher that stat will be.  For example if all else is equal a Chansey with IV in HP will have more maximum HP than another Chansey with IV.When people say that they have a IV Ditto what they mean is that they have a Ditto with  max IVs.  This is useful because Ditto can breed with any breedable pokemon and IVs can be inherited from parents when you breed.  Thus a Ditto with lots of max IVs is an asset for breeding a collection of competitive pokemon.,pokemon,cexfqa7,3,t5_2qmeb

204974,0,t1_cf1rm12,Evolution isnt an explanation for the beginning of the universe so I have no idea why you even brought up the big bang.  Sure Christian belief is easier to understand.  But thats because whenever they dont know something they instantly attribute it to God.  One single thing which in and of itself has no explanation so really its unreasonable to believe in God answers everything.  They presuppose an existence of God to use their answer God for anything they dont know when they have no evidence for Gods existence.Saying Christians have it figured out where we go when we die is fallacious.  They have nothing concrete.  Its a guess.  The phrase figured out at least in my opinion implies you have good reason to think youve learned something or understand some concept or are likely to be right about the problem at hand.  Nobody knows anything about what happens when we die.Whats more likely your soul another thing we have no evidence of somehow takes all of the knowledge held within your brain and teleports to some far off area in heaven where youre given a new body and you live forever in the clouds or you burn in hell or you simply cease to exist because your brain which happens to be everything you are stops functioning do you remember anything from before you were born??Sure maybe the realization that we arent special or that we have only a finite life is daunting.  But that doesnt mean you cant live forever.  Do something worth remembering and you can live for a significant length of time.  Anyway Id assert a belief in an afterlife is a bad thing because it makes people care less about the current one.  Theyre too focused on the next life that they screw up this planet this life and this time.Anyway Ive ranted long enough.,pokemon,cf1sgll,1,t5_2qmeb

236032,0,t1_cf55z5l,Bike wheels must find a balance. Downhill they prefer to have very little friction. If they were able to have  friction you would not be able to paddle at all. Hence if you can adjust the friction it would be good to have low friction when going downhill and the good friction that bike wheels have.Since wheels roll however the changes are not that significant. There is still some dependancy on the area under the wheel. Think of cars. Lesser width means actually less fuel used. But laws force you to have a certain width so it is safe enough in case the ground is icy etc..It also depends on profile. Here it gets really complex though.All in all it is very complex a topic. But the thing to keep in mind is that bike wheels dont try to have as little friction as possible so uAeitZean is not talking rubbish. Him refering to it as would probably is a good thing though ,pokemon,cf57q7i,3,t5_2qmeb

262230,0,t3_1x41wy,That is a nice wall of text.  For everyone else  TLDR OP believes Nintendo did the right thing by releasing bank in individual regions slowly spreading until it was everywhere.Now to correct you and everyone about the server issues. Bank was not responsible for the servers being overloaded. That was purely because it was Christmas. Lets say bank was to be released on the th of December in Japan and the nd worldwide. There would have been little to no problem. People dont understand the eShop servers and Nintendo Network were back up to fighting fit in a couple of days.It would have been no problem for Nintendo to release Bank in Japan on the th then do a periodical worldwide release. Their servers were not hit so bad as to warrant a one month delay for the rest of Japan and Asia and add a couple of weeks for the rest of the world.People were not upset because of the lack of bank. The anger stemmed from Nintendos lack of communication and essentially avoiding the issue. Except for them telling us to Please Understand.I understand that nobody has actually started paying for bank yet so we cant say we didnt get what we payed for when we should have. However Nintendo owes their fans the common courtesy to say Hey we messed up. ,pokemon,cf7xtgg,2,t5_2qmeb

Charizard and Heracross would both be capable and theyre two of Ashs best. Though they did just have Charizard for a season in Unova. Bulbasaur and Squirtle both could potentially too but I doubt hell ever evolve them.

AFTER you beat it you can hunt around in the friend safari in Kiloude city postgame for shinies where the encounter rate is much better. You could even fill up your national dex to get the shiny charm and increase your odds even more.And are you sure you are chain fishing right?

If we just use the singles list we ban things like mega kang who arent as broken in doubles. While there are a bunch of cheap sleep everything strategies they appear less often than youd think.And you are right about Smogon being more fun to watch but IMO VGC is more fun to play. So if its singles we use Smogon rules but if its doubles then we use VGC.,pokemon,cfaoiu1,0,t5_2qmeb

353656,0,t1_cfh5p4m,HoOh is based on the legend of the phoenix specifically the Fenghuang the immortal phoenix of China from which it derives its name. It is also based on the Huma bird a legendary bird that is said to never rest living its entire life flying continuously and resurrects itself and others in its own ashes and flames. It is a symbol of fortune and friendship and will bestow happiness to anyone who simply glimpses it. Many cultures view the Phoenix and Huma as symbols of resurrection It may also be based on many other firebirds some examples are the threelegged bird Simurgh and the Ember Bird. It also is similar to the rainbowfeathered bird god Achiyalabopa. ,pokemon,cfhf9br,7,t5_2qmeb

361365,0,t3_1y8amw,I would agree with JonnJonzz but if you really wanted to go for rare Mew with an English name is quite sought after Shaymin Manaphy... well any event legendary really. And if it has an English name then a lot of non Japanese will be wanting for one P Because pokemon such as Mew and Jirachi are occasionally going around but they have the Jap names. Also shiny legendaries that were events such as the dog trio Johto legendaries that were an event for BW would be quite good to try and class as rare.But as for nonlegendaries you would be looking at the rarer gender of pokemon. So female starters are always a good option. Female Milotic. Female Eevee. Dittos are always good. Shinies. You know. The usual. Anything from pokemon bank is a good way to bargain as some people dont have the older games so they rely on others to help them get the pokemon they cant. ,pokemon,cfi7z8p,3,t5_2qmeb

You can also get a Riolu from the same place you can get Mareep so I would. When you can grab an Eevee and tailor it to what your team needs. Get a Trapinch because Flygon is a beast. Finally when you can get an Aron.To recap Tepig Mareep Riolu Eevee Trapinch and Aron. Let them evolve.

You do not need the event Pokemon Mew Celebi Jirachi Deoxys Phione Manaphy Shaymin Darkrai Arceus Victini Genesect Meleotta Keldeo in order to complete the National Pokedex and get the shiny charm.I would try visiting Professor Sycamore and have him evaluate your Pokedexes. If you have found everything required for the Kalos Pokedexes he will give you the Oval Charm and for the National Pokedex he will give you the shiny charm. Dont forget to also visit the game director in the Coumarine Hotel in order to get your certificates for pokedex completion.I completed the national pokedex with just  Pokemon minus the ones mentioned above and have my shiny charm.

390383,0,t3_1yjufc,Heres the BEST way to levelup your PokemonGo to the threestar restaurant Le Wow in Lumiose City and play rotation battles there. Place the two or more Pokemon that you want to levelup in the ndthroughth slots in your party and make them ALL carry lucky eggs. Make your st Pokemon a level  one that can defeat any and all Pokemon types. If you have maximum style you can pay  versus the normal  cost per battle. You face  trainers in total and I have seen my Pokemon go from level  to level  every single time from starttofinish. Use the Experience OPower level  as well. To get to level  spam send this OPower to online friendsacquaintancespasserbys until you levelup to level  then do the same until you get to level   other options include using experience level  OPower and level  Prize Money OPower as youll get a profit from Le Wow this way. I recommend playing the rotation battle mode as you dont have to use the other two Pokemon if you have a very strong level  one and to play the rotation battle at least  times to go from level  to level  with the  Pokemon in your party that you want to levelup drastically.To get lucky eggs make sure you have a Chansey friend safari a Pokemon whose ability is Compound Eyes i.e. Vivililon is the typical choice and a darktype Pokemon that can learn the TM Thief I used Sneasel  also make sure that the Dark Pokemon has the Frisk ability so you will be able to see if the Chansey is holding a lucky egg.

397177,0,t3_1yml7h,I got my Shiny Charm by taking any pokemon that needed evolving to several rounds at Restaurant Le Wow with a L Sylveon Amulet Coined leading for Rotation battles Rotation lets the extra two pokemon beside your lead gain more Exp and with all that needed evolving equipped with Lucky Eggs farmed from a Chansey safari fainted CompoundEyes at front of party to increase wild item encounters Noivern with Frisk and Thief for farming. Also a lot of combing through Friend Safari and breedingevolving those I needed.Eventually after pokebank was released in Japan I got lucky by trading GTS a Volcarona for a Meowth then breeding that Meowth and using it to cycle through whatever other pokemon I needed. Ended up getting a Latias for another legendary trade I dont remember and cycletraded that Latias for other legendaries until I completed National Dex. Event pokemon are not necessary to complete the Dex.  Wonder Trade is also incredibly useful but relies a lot on luck. You could get a Totodile or a Bunnelby.Unpopular Opinion Sometimes people look for others who have a live dex and request a fiveeight hour tradeback for all  pokemon. While some people are down for this I personally dont like this method because to me it just shows how lazy you are especially if I look at your list and I see that you cant even be bothered to breed evolve  catch the easy pokemon yourself like freaking Butterfree or pokemon which evolve relatively early. I do recommend the above method however if you are just looking for certain pokemon that are difficult to obtain EG pokemon that evolve by item trades legendaries pokebanks etc.,pokemon,cflxlxp,3,t5_2qmeb

Unlike an action replay this doesnt actually modify the active games code.. instead its more like a Save Game Editor you plug your Game Cartridge into it and it can modify your save game with useful things i.e. maxxed out cashBPpokemiles etc. it doesnt seem to do anything that would set off Red Flags to the games built in checks doesnt cause Bad Eggs to spawn like an Action Replay does a telltale signside effect of a cheating device being used. So as far as the DS itself knows everythign you do with the Power Saves is legitimate as its not actually modifying any game code what so ever and isnt hacking pokemon with illegal moves nor IV hacks.. It only modifies your save game.,pokemon,cfpx1le,2,t5_2qmeb

493033,0,t3_1zrn8k,Im so happy that I got a shiny charizard hes my favorite pokemon of all time. And the only reason I bought X was so that could mega evlove him into a black one. The reason that he is my favorite pokemon is this Im  years old and when I was in kindergarten pokemon had just swept the nation with its popularity. On my Frist day of school I was made fun of by older kids for not having any pokemon cards of my own  I come from a lower middle class family aka we were poor and when I went home and told my mom what happen she didnt say much except that it would be okay. So I went to school the next day and avoided those kids all together and when I got home and off the bus my mom was waiting for me in the car. She said we were going to grandmas house. So I got in and she took me to a local card shop that was in our local town. It was on the way to Grandpas so I wasnt supisous at all. I had never been to a card shop before so when we went in she has were the pokemon cards were at and the man behind the counter reached behind him and have her a pack. Out of the box that they store them in. She said well take the whole box! My heart was fluttering inside my chest the happyness was over flowing. I was a six year old kid who just got the best give in the world. We went home and opened them together. And each box has one rare card in a random pack. And the rare card that I got was Charizard! It was my favorite thing in the whole world at the time. And the next day I went to school and showed the kids who made fun me my card and they were speechless. They wanted to battle and talk about the show and compare all the other cards that I had. So to end the story charizard is my favorite for that reason. Because of my mom,pokemon,cfwb835,1,t5_2qmeb

537360,0,t1_cg16x4b,I did my first run with it off the moment I got it. Its still very easy due to trainers barely having any pokemon too and the games AI seems to purposefully choose the wrong attacks to use against me to let me win e.g. charmeleon and opponents pokemon both in red opponent has faster pokemon with a move they used before that knocked me to half hp and out of all of the moves they can use they use the nondamaging move. Ive seen that happen far too often to be coincidence and it is very disappointing.

Unlike fish they do not have gills and must surface regularly to breathe.

565874,0,t1_cg4l4pz,It really should be ne with an accent. Jetix was the name of a Disneyrun kids channel or program block in many parts of the world until Disney came up with the Disney XD brand about four years ago. Like in the US Disney XD targets a male audience though some international Jetix variants such as Russia became Disney Channel instead Disney Channel skews toward a female audience.Jetix was a unit of Fox Kids until it was sold to Disney as part of its purchase of Fox Family Worldwide which is how Fox Family became ABC Family in the US. It was rebranded because Disney really couldnt keep the Fox name.,pokemon,cg4lfzp,15,t5_2qmeb

568861,0,t1_cg3pupf,Dual types can cancel out each others strengths and weaknesses. For example Lucarios Steel type takes half as much damage from Flying but his Fighting type takes twice as much damage. Well half of two is just one so they cancel each other out and hes completely neutral.Likewise resistances or weaknesses also stack with each other. Charizard is Fire and Flying type which are both weak to Rocktype moves. These both double on top of each other meaning that Charizard takes four times the normal damage from a Rocktype move. And since Fare and Flying both resist the Grass type these effects stack with each other and make it so he only takes  of the normal damage from Grasstype moves.,pokemon,cg4xnsw,1,t5_2qmeb

Headbutt has a  chance that the opponent cant do anything on his turn when u are faster than him. hiho paralysis speed dropNow the final thing is dunsparce ability Serene grace which doubles the effect of attacks.

621712,0,t3_21988p,In my opinion and what is arguably fact Pokemon is the greatest gaminganime franchise to have ever existed.  was when the first games were released when Pokemon came to popularity  years later it is still one of if not the most loved and popular franchise. It outdone other popular franchises such as Digimon DragonBallZ YuGiOh by quite a mile. Today it is only second to Mario in terms of sold quantities. However Pokemons ability to attract fans from ALL ages and I mean ALL ages  there are  year old married menwomen who still play for Gods sake  puts it above. Marios simplicity attracts its fans the games are easy to play its contents is small there arent many characters theres nothing wrong with this. Its simply a means for attracting fans and is effective. I myself find Mario quite fun. However Pokemon is a lot more complex and only its fans know that. From the blind eye POV it is viewed as a babys game. This is mainly due to cute Pokemon being the mascots Pikachu being the prime example. Nonfans simply see it as just a thing where you battle. However whats great about it is that it took such a simple idea admittedly a kids franchise idea and completely transformed it to attract all ages. The introduction of competitive battling which opened room for a huge variety of strategy new generations and game adjustments helped for further attraction too. Now Pokemon has many different types of games. New generations added Pokemon which people could relate to or favour  whether be cute or cool looking. The game adjustments such as splitting the special stat types of moves physical or special abilities gave it a whole new idea and expansion to build on. For this reason it attracted many people  some loved strategic battling competitive trainers some loved their favourite Pokemon and going on a journey through the game with it some like to fill the Pokedex collectors some simply found it enjoyable but werent huge fans. They liked the new types of games Mystery Dungeons Ranger Dash etc. And here today it stands when no one expected it to. What I think puts it above all others  the ability to adjust and still remain one of the most loved franchises. Others did not have this ability e.g Digimon. Today we have people making hacked games playing the classics from  years ago still buying games which are not being made anymore. No other franchise has achieved this. Fans have sentimental value with their possessions. And whats great is that Pokemon looks nowhere near going out of business. Instead there is still so much room for expansion and the fans huge demands are struggling to being met. It started from one boy who used to trade bugs with his friends. He decided to make a little game of this and thought of Pokemon. Now his originally pet fantasy has become worldwide. Just a small thought from a single boy became such a success and thats unique. Kids franchise to the blind eye universal to those who know it.Edit One more point to build on the ability to adjust the struggle to meet all fans demands isnt a sign of inability but because demand keeps on coming and are varied. If Pokemon were to ever look to run out of business there is still so much demand to be filled case in point  a game including all regions is a popular one. So even if people simply got bored of it Pokemon could go out with a bang  they could make this mega game and go. Although perhaps the vast amount of people this mega game would attract will probably put it back in business. If not those die hard fans can end it on a high note having played the final game which journeys through every single thing about Pokemon. Tears will be shed for me at least ,pokemon,cgaxtn1,16,t5_2qmeb

631539,0,t1_cgbqyb2,I have about  hours and I am almost to this point just missing some event legendaries so here are my tips. Get a meowth off gts and breed that to get most of the breedable pokemon from gts. Get Pokemon Dream Radar so you can easily get spare legendaries to trade for all of the legendaries. By this point you should have the shiny charm so you can breed shiny pokemon and there are people willing to trade  or  event legendaries for one shiny. This is the method Ive used and Im only a few events short.,pokemon,cgc21rt,1,t5_2qmeb

634959,0,t1_cgcf1e4,Sort of! If you turn the stereoscopic D effect off its rendering the whole D scene once directly from the cameras position. If you turn the effect on its rendering the whole scene twice once from slightly left of the camera and once from slightly right which causes the stereoscopic D effect.And since its rendering the scene twice its taking twice as long to draw each frame. So if you can squeeze a frame out in a th of a second youll still get a smooth  frames per second but if it takes any longer than a th of a second youll get a sub framerate.Toggling D on and off during a battle in XY is the easiest way to see this. The framerate stutters and drops with D enabled particularly during attack animations with lots of particles or effects but everything is smooth as butter with D disabled.,pokemon,cgcg1ho,1,t5_2qmeb

635841,0,t3_21fkkj,The biggest issue in terms of competitive battling is on the legendaries as they cant be bred. As such hacked ones are going to be better than nonhacked. That said however theres RNGed legendaries. Ive seen a lot of people blast others for using hacked Pokemon but are more than happy to use their RNGed ones. While it may be less illegitimate it still provides a huge advantage over the average player. In my opinion you accept the hacked legendaries and the RNGed ones or you should disagree with both. You cant just say one is acceptable because its just abusing in game mechanics and then hate on Pokemon with the same stats that is just as legal just because of its origin.For none legendaries the benefit of hacking over breeding is the access to tutor moves. OK these Pokemon cant be used in tournaments because they arent Kalos born but youll see plenty on WiFi or whatever.Outside of battling hacked Pokemon can ruin the trade economy. Those that trade them to unknowing people are a bit... cheeky. There are places for people to trade hacked Pokemon and it should all be kept there. Giving people who think they are getting a  genuine ALAMOS Darkrai shouldnt be conned out of their own legitimate Oblivia Deoxys as its just not the same.

639238,0,t1_cgcxa7u,Theyre at a disadvantage because the rest are at an advantage. Just because its self contained doesnt make it acceptable. Lets use any other online multiplayer game like WoW or Counter Strike or whatever. That thing that exploits a game mechanic to let people who use it get a big advantage? Patched. Found a new one? Patched. Oh look a nePATCHED. GF couldnt do that so it persisted. With XY theyve finally stopped it. Doesnt that tell you they dont like it?Learning to exploit a game doesnt make it right. An exploit is an exploit. And an exploit is generally considered bad except in Pokemon apparently.... Yes everyone could learn to exploit and be on the same level. Equally everyone could gen their own Pokemon and be on the same level. Yet for some reason thats bad and anyone who does it is satan because youre exploiting a different flaw in the game.The funny thing with this subreddit people defend RNG people defended PowerSaves people use Action Replay. But if you say youre genning Pokemon? Get out now before the lynchmob turns up.That is my problem. I dont care if people hack. I dont care if people RNG. I dont care if they go to Shigeru Miyamoto or Reggie and get given Pokemon that dont even exist through any other means but as a personal favour from them. I care that people seem to think one is so much better than the other despite the fact its still exploiting a game mechanic which is usually considered bad in any other game I play. And in fairness TPP? Its so hard not to abuse the AI in Red. Its so badly programmed its almost impossible not to.

And you raise good points that I didnt think about  youre probably right that nobody would check the thread for one.I think a compromise that could be reached would be to allow people to post pictures of their products but only to PM their online stores to those who ask for it. Also videos and streams are already allowed if you contribute to rPokemon regularly.

712550,0,t3_229ilw,The Mewtwo might be legit but its unlikely given the other three. Its impossible to encounter an Arceus at level  since the Azure Flute was never distributed and all of the events gave out level  ones. The Typhlosion was supposedly encountered at Floccesy Ranch which is only possible if you hatch a Cyndaquil egg there but it was met at level  so its also hacked. Additionally those three all share the OT PCApp which also indicates that they were hacked. The Mewtwo looks slightly better since it has a different OT and was encountered at the right level but the fact that its ID number is identical to the other three is a red flag.,pokemon,cgl9q0l,2,t5_2qmeb

I cut the bottom left corners of my cards back then and put a little check in the top left. Anyways a few months later I traded it and some other stuff for a Lucario. A few years went by and I started homeschooling. About a year and a half ago at the homeschool group things Pokemon meet thing I participated in a random trade thing basically wondertrade but with cards and on a much smaller scale. The card I got in return was that Oddish card. Same cut and check. I never found out who put it in the random trade system or how it ended up in my homeschool group but I didnt think about it because I was too busy trying not to cry It didnt work but at least I tried.,pokemon,cgq7tvu,3,t5_2qmeb

I think the relevant example would be that IF he got the burn hax itd bring down his attack and he could switch into something with special bulk. Then it could use stat boosting moves lay down entry hazards or use something like healbell since the squirtle wouldnt be able to dish much damage. Albeit perhaps most of those types of moves arent available in little cup I never play it so Im not very familiar with it which is the only place such pokemon would appear even with evolite.  If he didnt get the burn had he could switch into a revenge killer to OHKO it as you mentioned.,pokemon,cgqglea,11,t5_2qmeb

770621,0,t3_22zcok,Large scale construction i.e. the body took about  hours including fabric cutting. It was the first kigurumi either of us had made so there was some trial and error going on. I think I ended up having to make  runs to Joann Fabrics or Michaels for supplies I forgot. The light blue fabric is CRAZY soft and warm.Hand sewn details basically almost everything that isnt light blue took about  hours and was done most of today with a few bits yesterday before and after work. Going forward next time I make one of these Im sticking with one type of fabric for sure I have three here and probably something with maybe a little less detail work that needs to be hand sewn. Otherwise Im pretty happy with it. I need to take some stuffing out of the head poofle I think because it sits a little oddly but I might just be lazy and leave it.

Now reading magikarp   mana is just too much imo.Love the idea of mewtwos black planeswalker but the  looks a bit strong.Psybeam  not op but still the milling...Vileplume seems op considering how much  there is in this setEarthquake seems a bit op possible make it cost xxfire instead?I dont quite get the use of submission  damage to itself?Overgrowth seems too cheap for what it does.Shared experience is a killer vs certain decks  like the pyromancer deck I run right now one lightning strike and I am out of the game.Venasaur seems strong for  mana   and such a nice ability.Weedle is strong in my opinion  take the sedge scorpion of right now  with deathtouch for   Weedle  more damage and a fallback to keep it going not a balanced card imo.Agatha  Jace v.But seriously that last effect is stupid for a Do you run a milling deck by any chance?Bruno  does this mean say I had  cards on the field and you had   I take  damage and you take ?Lorelei seems nicely balanced and lanes seems good possibly even a tad UP.Missingno is missingnoWhat more can you want?Lightningrod could be abused in certain cases.The cities are nice.Victory road  token decks  ????Overall a great set and inventive.,pokemon,cgs36cx,1,t5_2qmeb

847106,0,t1_ch0jpzv,Youre both right this is from BulbapediaAbsol is most likely based on the Bai Ze of Chinese mythology also known as the kutabe or hakutaku. The Bai Ze predicted that a plague would sweep through the Toyama Prefecture of Japan. It is generally described as a white beast that can take the form of a large mountainous lion distinguished by having one or two horns on its head. It is also sometimes said to have an extra eye on their head or back which may be represented by the oval that appears on Absols forehead. The Bai Ze is considered to be intelligent and gifted with the ability to understand human speech. It may be also derive from the white chamois a mountain dwelling goatlike animal which local superstition claims represents the embodiment of death and should any hunter harm one they would die within the year. It may be also be based on the black cat superstition...,pokemon,ch0kjcd,17,t5_2qmeb

I think that overall the Pokmon you encounter earlier in the games are first and the the ones that you encounter way later in the game are last always followed by the legendaries. I know that in XY this is followed to a T but earlier games have been looser about which are listed first. A radical example would be Eevee in the first games.

There havent been many events yet internationally at least. Im pretty sure the codebased events only let you use the code once. There havent been Secret Bases since Platinum.

Platinum is considered the hardest due to the AI and the elite  Heart Gold Soul Silver requires a lot of grinding due to low level wild pokemon Gen  is where the challenge started and I think a pretty medium difficulty XY are pretty easy if you choose to use the experience share Gen  is considered fairly easy due to poison no longer damaging out of battleIts also worth noting a large number of people play with a duplication clause to stop a team being full of pidgeys and allow more diversity but thats your call.Edit you can check out rnuzlocke to see what other people have done and for tips and more advise,pokemon,ch9ksoy,1,t5_2qmeb

From here I can move them to Black  with ease. Now moving them to X and Y is easy with the PokeBank.

This means the frames thing that determines stats and shininess that you can get a shiny on are set and will never change unlike the newer games.So if you have a shiny frame at  minutes any Pokemon encountered exactly  minutes after you start your game will be shiny.This also means that if you dont have an early shiny frame  seconds you will never get a shiny starter. So vary the time you take to start the game and pick a starter as much as possible and if you dont get a shiny after  SRs start a new game so your shiny frame changes.There is unfortunately no way to tell what your shiny frame is that early in the game.,pokemon,chdeb0p,1,t5_2qmeb

Making such games available on another platform will allow a significant amount of people myself and the majority of people I know who only own a DS or a Wii to play these games to play them on other consoles. The thing is people dont own a PS or an XBox just to play Uncharted or Halo there are SO many games that appeal to people of different tastes. In many cases someone who owns a Nintendo console on the other hand owns it for the sole purpose to play a single game Mario Pokemon Zelda etc.. If such games were available on say a PS XBOX or PC someone like me or many other people wouldnt bother even buying a Nintendo console since I would now have the ability to play my favorite Nintendo game in addition to hundreds of other high quality games on another platform.,pokemon,chjcuds,2,t5_2qmeb

1035938,0,t3_25yxc2,I like this idea but it kinda takes away the purpose of IV breeding. What I noticed recently was that half of my competitive pokes were either traded to me or descended from pokemon traded to me because I wanted some competitive guys I didnt want to breed. The whole point of pokemon is not equality its about connection. If they made this an actual mechanic in the game then it would take away the whole purpose of connection and trade. It would all be about battles and not as many people would have a connection with each other. I love trading what Ive made personally to others in exchange for what theyve made. If everything was just given to us it wouldnt be as special. I do like the idea for people who dont have their own competitive pokemon but but I feel it just takes away the whole purpose of competitive battling that we spent hours trying to breed a perfect pokemon  raise it and use it.,pokemon,chm1hjr,9,t5_2qmeb

There were tons of trainers with GastlyHaunter in Red and Gengar got a mega. ElectrikeManectrics are common in RSE but that got a mega. It seems more feasible to give Mightyena or Crobat a mega than to give one to both Sharpedo and Camerupt. As for the metagame Sharpedo Camerupt and Mightyena arent fantastic. I think if any of them or Crobat were to receive a megaevolution the Pokemon community would welcome it with open arms.,pokemon,ci495nf,2,t5_2qmeb

Okay its not that exciting but for  year old me it wasI also have a lot of personal value to Sapphire. In my first Sapphire run I caught a Latias that soon became a symbolic friend to me. Ive had Depression for quite a while now and as I brought that Latias up through Emerald Diamond and Platinum I realized that it was one of the only things that has been with me for most of my life hence my Latias obsession so it became my best friend that helped me through some tough times. Sadly back in  my Platinum cartridge holding the Latias was snapped in half in my suitcase during a plane trip by some horribly trained workers incharge of putting luggage on the plane. She would have been  if she made it to XY and I plan on catching Latias in Alpha Sapphire and I want to believe that that will be that same Latias.,pokemon,ci4ayuo,0,t5_2qmeb

Six resistances are six resistances no matter how you slice it.EDIT Might as well toss Torkoal out there as well. Also I have no idea why youre using Camerupt as an example of stall considering his defenses are all very lackluster.

Keep asking yourself am I ready to go through the same region again once you feel like it then play. This way I didnt feel bored at all. The areas are quite similar but BW adds a lot! New areas and changed looks. Its not that similar tbh and BW also has the PWT. I loved them and think the storyline is the best of all gens by far. TLDR it certainly isnt the same thing twice and the overall experience of the two games is amazing.

Not like getting away with stealing a center full of Pokemon or actually managing to capture pikachu hasnt Giovanni just given up on that pikachu already? Hes gotten beat numerous times even by Giovannis own Persian its not that powerful but succeed in something relatively menial. Like robbing a bank or stealing food. Maybe even successfully getting their hand on some kind of powerful item like the key to the Ultimate Weapon before Team Flare could get it. Of course Team Rocket as a whole would be ultimately defeated and the heroes would get the key back. The only plan they ever really used that actually worked was a pitfall trap. But even that was only temporary. Speaking of that someone in Ashs crew ALWAYS had a grass Pokemon. Anytime they fell into a pitfall why didnt they just have their grass Pokemon use Vine Whip to get them out? Misty Ash have your Bulbasaur use Vine Whip to pull us out so we can save Pikachu!Ash No... There has to be another way. What the fuck. The anime infuriates me sometimes.

But the thing is I DO know what its like to not only make art but to sell it and treat it like a business. I wont pretend my skills are enough to make big bucks and all I did was using my own art sell tshirts but my cousin has a ton of skill and we worked together to get his stuff out there. And you know what? People took his stuff and sold it for their own. We worked hard to advertise and get his stuff all around town and it worked super well. If youre struggling to make cash off of your art and you sit there blaming theives you need to step your advertising game up because if some scummy thief can take your work and sell it surely you can do better since you have skills to create more. ,pokemon,cij1r4x,1,t5_2qmeb

1405903,0,t3_2a8f94,Im  and I play Pokemon avidly. Just because it was originally a childrens game doesnt mean that it cant be played by adults. There is so much strategy that goes into it with the new games that it can be fun exciting and very challenging even for us. Pokemon is exactly like any other strategy or turnbased RPG out there well in actuality its much better but for the sake of explaining it to family and friends. Tell your judgmental peers to eff off and at this point youre  youre a legal adult and your parents cant send you off anywhere no matter how much they dislike your hobby. Are you selfconscious because you dont know any peers IRL that play Pokemon? If thats the case its easy enough to find some. You could post here or on your local area subreddit asking about anyone who might play and if they want to get together sometime. My friends have a local area Facebook group and we chat all the time.  just a suggestion. ,pokemon,cisidao,2,t5_2qmeb

1415283,0,t3_2ac5in,I cant really explain Forretress but Gyarados is a flying type and is eligible for sky battles so thats probably the reason why hes floating.Lemme explain real quick. Most flying pokemon or pokemon that were eligible for sky battles were given battle poses that reflected their ability to fly. Though Gyarados cant actually fly dont ask...Pokemon like Tropius Skarmory Salamence and in this case Gyarados are all depicted to be flying rather than in their usual grounded pose so that if they were sent into a sky battle it wouldnt look like they were standing in mid air. Get what I mean? Its one of my most hated parts about gen . A lot of pokemon just look goofy or awkward all because of a gimmicky battle mechanic that was barely used in the game at all.  sky battles in total and you cant repeat them IIRC.Oh and a friendly reminder in case you were talking about XYCharacter Sprites rendered in D are called models. Unless the series takes a Uturn and goes back to D all Sprites are called Models now. ,pokemon,citonjq,1,t5_2qmeb

All of that takes place in single player and you shouldnt be policing anyone elses single player game.The funniest thing about your deep hatred of hacks is that hacking has literally no affect on you or me.

Being that he spends most of his Pokmonplaying time on Pokmon Showdown he didnt notice the ball and wouldnt have known it was illegal if he had.Whether the outcry which to be fair was a very small group of people and something that hasnt been spoken of since July th by anyone it would seem will lead to a hacklegality check that is more comprehensive at future tournaments is really only something we can speculate on at this point there is no definitive answer until someone who actually has control over that choice makes it known.,pokemon,cjb6gks,2,t5_2qmeb

1651682,0,t3_2d8euz,Im surprised Gen  won. I have a partial and an impartial answer to this. My partial answer is Gen I. It was the first Pokemon game I played and I have the most nostalgia for it. My impartial answer is Gen II. It introduced the most out of any Pokemon game. Gen II introduced new types new mechanics and a new story. I played Gen III as a kid as well however it suffered in too many departments for me to love it. Gen III didnt go above and beyond like Gen II did. It barely met my expectations as a kid. There were some interesting features but I dont feel like they were fleshed out enough. Diving should have been so much more and should have been a bigger part of the story the huge ocean should have had more in it and there should have been an after story. Further Gen III was the first generation to not be directed by Satoshi and you could tell. It didnt quite feel like Pokemon to me. I know it still was yet there was a definite difference in art direction. Gen III not feeling like Pokemon will probably come as a surprise to those who didnt start with Gen I as a kid. You had Gen I and II which while different still had the same feel. Then you had Gen III which was just completely different in atmosphere. From Gen III Pokemon changed into something else imo. I feel like ORAS is Game Freaks chance to make Gen III really good. ,pokemon,cjncwhh,1,t5_2qmeb

And saying the game is hard IF you use rules designed to make ANY pokemon game hard? No shit sherlocke. see what I did there?I shouldnt have to impose rules upon myself just to make the game fun.

Zygardes signature move Lands Wrath is also a ground type move also has  base power also has  accuracy but no secondary effect. Thousand Arrows and Thousand Waves are like a more perfected version of Lands Wrath. When Zygarde changes forms Lands Wrath could change into either Thousand Arrows or Thousand Waves depending on which form he transforms into. Also Zygardes Pokedex entry states it is more powerful than Xerneas and Yveltal which it clearly isnt and that it has a secret power.

1730411,0,t1_cjxa72s,ampampamp Intersex sfw gtIntersex in humans and other animals is a variation in sex characteristics including chromosomes gonads or genitals that do not allow an individual to be distinctly identified as male or female. Such variation may involve genital ambiguity and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XYmale and XXfemale.   Intersex infants with ambiguous outer genitalia may be surgically changed to more easily fit into a socially accepted sex category. However this is considered controversial with no firm evidence of good outcomes.  Others may opt in adulthood for surgical procedures in order to align their physical sex characteristics with their gender identity or the sex category to which they were assigned at birth Others will not become aware that they are intersexunless they receive genetic testingbecause it does not manifest in their phenotype.gtgtImage i  Participants at the third International Intersex Forum Malta in December Interesting Androgyny | Futanari | Organisation Intersex International Australia | Organisation Intersex International Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcjxaz oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecjxaz.

1759486,0,t1_ck0wt0k,I dont know about cartoonish but there is definitely a different style with each generation. Back when Gen  was being released people complained it was becoming very Digimonlike with pokemon that seemed to have extraneous parts that didnt really make sense.I doubt theres a list of who created what pokemon but more designers were added as the series went on to the point that the first Westerner to design official pokemon came in on Gen . Of the staff members that designed Pokemon in one way or another the following are ones that were recent additions as of Gen  according to Bulbapedia Keiko Moritsugu James Turner Megumi Mizutani Maiko Fujiwara Tomohiro Kitakaze Reiko Tanoue Mana Ibe Lee HyunJung Saya Tsuruta Hiroki Fuchino and Kenkichi Toyama.  of  were new designers. A lot of these new people came from illustrating a card from the TCG. Others were given a Special Thanks from Platinum but all had not yet been involved in designing a new Pokemon. For a lot of the illustrators it is unknown who created what pokemon. Only about  designers have listed what pokemon they created.XY added Hitoshi Ariga to the roster with Keiko Moritsugu and Maiko Fujiwara dropped both unknown of which pokemon they had designed.Overall however Ken Sugimori is still the lead pokemon designer and still gets to sign off on what is acceptable for the games and what isnt. ,pokemon,ck0xva6,1,t5_2qmeb

Thankfully Pokemon XY has plenty of familiar Pokemon for you to catch and Im sure youll enjoy a lot of the new ones.The game is pretty easy but in an enjoyable way. Talk to every person you see in the game and youll get a ridiculous amount of items moves and Pokemon. Youll quickly get a choice of your favorite original Kanto starter too with a new Megastone that lets their final evolution evolve even further during battle youll have fun haha. If you want any extra starters or any original Pokemon that you remember feel free to PM me and Ill see what I can do for you Also the DS D effect isnt actually very good for this game sadly and it lags but the game looks and runs great with it turned off.,pokemon,ck1c4np,2,t5_2qmeb

1764124,0,t1_ck1ip5m,yeah in pokken i can see him having really slow attack and movement speed good defense and drain punch as a main move with a lifeleeching secondary effect rest would work likewhen youre using the move you cannot attack nor move but you can stop that whenever youd like to only healing when using that move example as i previously said yoshimitsu. i can also see him with headbutt and high jump kick. abilitywise intimidate seems like the best option decreasing the opponents strength. bulk up doesnt seem too farfetchd making it some sort of frustrating WHY WONT IT DIE character not my cup of tea but that seems fun.,pokemon,ck1ivw2,1,t5_2qmeb

In the competitive play however you are on the exact same playing field as your opponent so every advantage helps. As a result IVs can have a huge impact on the game because it can have a pretty significant influence on your stats.,pokemon,ck32t7v,1,t5_2qmeb

Have it be forest fire themed since it is already part ghost it could be a burning tree. I know Trevenant has a niche as a harvester but if it changes abilities I dont think White Smoke would be bad. For example if it kept Harvest and a few more fire moves are added other than wilowisp like flare blitz I could see it taking recoil and recovering by harvesting a sitrus berry.

They will take the price of both games  and subtract from it the cost of the plushie  I think.  So if you try to return any of the three items of the set OR AS plushie you get back a third of the combined cost  or ..

The meta is going to be changing a lot once Phantom Forces is released this Halloween internationally so as the format adapts you can jump right in!

1889523,0,t1_ckgd9x7,Whoa man relax. Im not being illogical Im simply thinking along a different line of logic than you are. You are determined that the question has no answer and Im trying to look for an answer and presenting my thought process to you. Also I didnt say you cannot comprehend!!!. I said perhaps the answer is that we cannot comprehend. Maybe our language hasnt expanded enough to cover properly the concepts were trying to grasp. I mean how do we comprehend infinity? Its actually a really hard concept to grasp if you stop and think too long about it.Going by the exact dictionary definition Omnipotent means absolute power able to do anything. Therefore cant is not in the vocabulary of an omnipotent being by definition. You dont have to insult me and Im not flailing about desperately. Im exhausting all avenues of thought before conceding the point. Now unpleasantness aside I actually thought about the initial question itself a bit more. If an omnipotent beings power  infinity then to satisfy the criteria it would have to create a weight of infinity. Of course that doesnt exist because there is nothing greater than infinity. So I suppose the answer would indeed be no but not because of a lack of omnipotence but in fact because of it because there is nothing greater than infinity there is nothing too heavy for it to lift. You cant think of a omnipotent beings power as finite thats the problem of the paradox. The only reason I think we cannot properly comprehend this isnt because were too stupid or because Im completely stumped but because we simply have nothing to compare to infinity. We havent witnessed a creature of infinite power God or otherwise and as such we have no way of knowing how it would work beyond sheer speculation.Now please if you wish to continue the discussion refrain from insults. Im not trying to be holier than thou if thats the impression you got Im just stubborn and am thinking about a question that interests me. Is that truly ignorance?,pokemon,ckgvo3e,1,t5_2qmeb

1917111,0,t1_ckjak4l, wouldnt do much to the oceans. There isnt enough water in the air and our oceans are insanely vast. USGS estimates that there is  cubic kilometers of water in the atmosphere. The surface area of all the oceans on the earth is  million square kilometers Dividing the two will give us an approximation of how much the oceans would raise and thats . cm. Similarly  and  couldnt possibly have enough water to have a noticeable effect. and  are the only plausible options here and  is just magic so looking at  according to how stuff works if Antarctica were to melt it would increase the water level by  meters! But Antarticas average temperature is  degrees Celsius so for that to happen the earth would have to fry and isnt that Groudons job? And that brings me to the final point whats causing the sea level to rise on earth? Its actually due to water expanding as it gets hotter. The only thing massive enough to increase the depths of the ocean is actually the ocean. Because theres such an insane surface area over the worlds oceans its a huge target for absorbing more heat and thats why the oceans are rising.Ironically the only way the water levels could rise would be by increasing the temperature and that means team Aqua is worshiping the wrong god.,pokemon,ckk765g,1,t5_2qmeb

Sylveon can be a bulkier sort of sweeper set with Pixilate Hyper Voice and it can also fulfil the role of special wall. Vaporeon has a shitload of HP so I recommend using it as a cleric to pass Wish on to your other Pokemon. Umbreon is somewhere inbetween Sylveon and Vaporeon so if youd like to use it maybe Curse Umbreon could work it was sort of a dickhead set in Gen IV so Ive heard. Espeon of course is a good Pokemon to keep hazards off with Magic Bounce so maybe it could be a second special sweeper or a supporter with Reflect and Light Screen or somethingTo be honest I dont use the Eeveelutions very often anymore so Id encourage you to look for a more informed opinion.

2111821,0,t1_cl87npw,gtYou honestly believe that any of the villains in Korra received more character development than Zuko did?Zuko was never a villain. He was an antagonist in season  but he was always written to become a protagonist later. Thats why he got character developement.gtHonestly I cant really think of any character development that Ive seen in Korras protagonists obviously weve been told about their developmentespecially considering the recent time skip but honestly their development seems to plateau whenever a new season startsBolin coming to terms with his inability to metal bend and instead finding another form of bending that fits better with both his personality and heritage? Just a small thing from season .In ATLA they all get  or  episodes devoted to their character developement Katara going to find the person who took her mom away for instance but it doesnt really change them much. Katara got overly aggresive for that one episode just for her personality to change back to normal afterwards.gtKorra literally would have died at the end of the third season had it not been for all of the air benders making that tornadoNot really a Deus Ex. The airbenders were well established we knew they were there and they didnt do anything we didnt already know they could.gt and for the fact that the Venom of the Red Lotus was a metalbased poisonwhich is BTW one of the dumbest things Ive ever heardYour ignorance shouldnt be a factor here.gtand for the fact that there happened to be a couple of metal benders among all of the air benders.The daughter of the metal bending citys leader had been taken. Not sure how this is a deus ex.gtAnd dont even get me started on all the people who died falling off mountains during that final battle. Not really sure if you are refering to the metal benders attaching themselves to the cliffs to save themselves?gtI think in terms of deus exxing the best Korra can hope for is a push.I disagree. Season  and  are pretty much Deus Ex free and Season  at least have some meaning in its DeusgtIf youre going to knock TLA for the lion turtle then youre going to have to knock Korra because theyre about to do the same thing with Toph.I absolutely wont. There is a difference between sage advice and sudden rd option. Korra might be getting some advice from Toph but Toph cant magically give Korra a tool to prevent Korra from having to face her choices. Sage advice helps them overcome their obstacles it doesnt remove them. Usinglearning spirit bending took no effort or realization from Aang.

Why have Latis fight taillows if you know everyone in the sky is rocking one?  It just seems silly.  Maybe the eon duo are being shown off because other pokemon wont have their own sprites?  Although their meganess makes me think this might be exclusive to them even though that makes the low level crap make no sense.EDIT  Never mind.  I read the eon flute bit.  This appears to be exclusive to them but they arent in your party Theyre NPCs.  Hence the Taillows.    The taillows still suggest this will be introduced as a feature fairly early.

I also remember that on the last day of school I was challenging the champion Steven with my team of a Blaziken Swellow Ludicolo Solrock Delcatty and Flygon. It was an awesome to have everyone crowd around my Gameboy at this critical battle mostly because I had trouble socializing with people at that age. Now it feels like my Pokemon generation has gone full circle. That being said I will play Omega Ruby without any strategy guides just like I did  years ago picking out the Pokemon for my team based on simply how cool they look.

I admit I could have explained this a little better I just mean the new graphics. How are they worse you ask? Because the world looks ugly compared to d and is hard on the eyes. I dont want Colosseum on a portable console I want old simple pokemon and by old I mean anything before x and y. Its the same with people wanting a majoras mask remake on the ds instead of the TV. Probably just a vocal minority with shit taste though.. Roller skates are even more stupid than the mega evolution. How about an option to turn the skates off and on so I dont have to switch which pad Im using if I want to use one or the other?

Gen  came out around the time of brawl so it made sense to put him in.  Now?  Im kind of annoyed to see him and not Mewtwo or Sceptile being in the complete roster not including this DLC thing for Mewtwo which isnt available to everyone.  Im fine with Charizard and Greninja being in there but there are  types and grass type wasnt given a pokemon in smash just because it wasnt popular enough to make the cut.  Even if it wouldnt be as popular a choice as Charizard they still couldve done it to complete the trifecta...its just wrong otherwise.,pokemon,cli66i6,-7,t5_2qmeb

However I guess if I describe her from when she is first introduced she is basically incredibly stubborn rather self conscious insanely determined and shown to be kind hearted. She has the tendency to be kind fierce but that isnt always the case especially by the end. The thing is thought it isnt just Ryukos character that is so amazing. I mean the final villains are presented in such a way that makes you genuinely dislike them the side characters all have arcs and personality traits that makes them funny and interesting and the antiheroes are actually sympathetic.

2366384,0,t1_cm44nd8,Wish I saw this before lol. I just finished battling them. It was pretty tough but I made it through. I dont play as intensely so I switch out pokemon to put them against their strength when I defeat one opponents pokemon which is why they all mainly have attacks relevant to their types. It worked for me because I gave Ampharos a Magnet macho brace on Zoroark the point was to slow him down and use Payback didnt work too well since his speed his really high the accuracy lens on Golduck Crit Lens on Minccino Sharp Beak on Unfezent and I think a fire booster on Emboar.I kept those attacks for Golduck because the accuracy boost helped with landing hits. Ampharos did faint during one battle but thats because I used him to weaken the opponent then finished off with Minccinos Retaliate. I know its kind of a dumb way to do it but I focus more on attacks and speed rather than defense. For the most part my attacks landed first and gave me effective advantage especially with their boosters.,pokemon,cm4701b,1,t5_2qmeb

Here we have a community where the role of mods is to support the community.  From that perspective you could easily argue that community should be involved.  The flip side is that collectives tend to bandwagon instead of thinking things through as much.  Edit  So it really depends on the community.What SHOULD be is there should be a clear hierarchy within the mods like there is in a workplace where there would be a head moderator whos job is to supervise the mods and act as a support for them having final say in administrative decisions like this.  Clearly thats not the case though and I suspect there is a power struggle within mod groups because they lack structure.,pokemon,cm4kncn,9,t5_2qmeb

2391825,0,t3_2mt24h,. Yes definitely.. There are two primary goals in a Pokmon game to catch all the Pokmon which is very hard to do there are  of the things and to defeat the Champion of the region. To do so you have to defeat the  Gyms within the region to get their Gym Badges at which point you can challenge the Pokmon League and face the Elite Four and Champion. Besides these boss battles there are also battles against the evil teams of each gamemildly nefarious organizations whose evil plots you thwart throughout the course of your adventure. While the common grunts arent at all tough the leaders are at a decently bosslike level of difficulty.. Battles are turnbased and there is nothing timesensitive that affects the outcome of an attack. Damage is based on the power of the move the relevant attack and defense stats of the attacker and defender respectively and whether the moves type matches the Pokmons type.. I recommend that you get the new Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire games for them assuming youre either buying them new consoles anyway or they already have DSs. Essentially most Pokmon games come in paired versions with slight differences between the games e.g. a few versionexclusive Pokmon that are in one game but not the other or vice versa so youd want to get one of the two for each kid. ORAS come out on Friday and from what Ive heard theyre very good for newcomers despite being remakes of older Pokmon games.. There is indeed multiplayer. There are two primary interactions between Pokmon games trading one Pokmon from one game for one Pokmon from another game and battling another game. Both are enjoyable trading is a way to swap a Pokmon you have for one you dont for example one of the version exclusives and battling tests your skill and training against another players. Be warned that if they go into online battling pitting their team against a random other players there are quite a few people who take this very very seriously and theres a decent chance theyll get steamrolled. But overall I would very much recommend that you get them Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. Which kid gets which game is irrelevant as the games are pretty similar and neither appeals more to a particular gender you can choose your characters gender in both its just better if you have both. Prepare to learn more weird creature names than you ever thought you would have to and welcome however tangentially to the Pokmon community!,pokemon,cm7c4xw,2,t5_2qmeb

I got yellow later and did the same thing and then a few year later when GoldSilver came out I got silver with a brand new GBC. Silver was my favorite version and I still have that copy to this day even though it doesnt work.Sadly I convinced myself pokemon was for kids after that...I would occasionally borrow my friends copy of ruby and then later diamond but I never put much effort into either. It wasnt until HGSS came out that I finally remembered how great the series was and nostalgiad the crap out of myself with SS. I got back on the train with Black and White and then waited with like a kid on Christmas for X to come out and have played it so much.ORAS for me is a pretty new experience.

Thats a strange claim isnt it? Unless youre assuming as Cynthia says the people of Sinnoh did that Dialga and Palkia are space and time based on their cool attacks then it would make perfect sense to say that about the Lake trio. Then it would make perfect sense to say that these three legendaries that can control DialgaPalkia must be able to bind space and time. gt Im pretty sure Mew is just the Pokemon that all life evolved from after Creation and Im pretty sure Regigigas in legend was the one who moved the continents while Groudon created land and Celebi has the ability to time travel rather than be the master of time. I feel like Mystery Dungeon did an interesting job of explaining that mythos.I agree with all of those. I just think that their absence from the myths of a region where the universe supposedly began is a sign that the universe probably didnt begin there otherwise those plates would mention Groudon building Mt. Coronet.Havent played Mystery Dungeon does it really get into this? Sounds fascinating especially since Ive heard such good things about the plot.

Similarly RS covers RSE and ORAS and  covers GSC and HGSS. Remakes are counted with the originals because they are mostly the same story canonically.If anything the games left out by Matsumiya are YCE FRLG and ORAS the choice to use pictures of the remade versions was just an arbitrary decision by uthejake.With this in mind I think the Matsumiya timeline is pretty comprehensive.

2481817,0,t1_cmihykn,Yep he really breaks it all down a few more things would be to keep in mind some pokemon can gain desirable moves but only through breeding so you may want to check when cooking up your team. As far as competitive team building goes composition wise typing moveset the main thing is coverage. Having  pokemon who can steadily swap in for one of your other pokemon fire from water water from grass groundflying waterground ghostnormalfighting. From there think about the pokemon you enjoy and the sort of team youd like or maybe even do that first! Really much more pokemon will be viable with new evolutions megas and whatever if any unique Move Tutors another big thing.,pokemon,cmiifo9,-1,t5_2qmeb
2481840,0,t1_cmiiajf,IV training is impossible youre thinking about breeders that try to go for perfect IV Pokemon which is a rather complicated process. IVs are determined from birth.EVs are simpler  every Pokemon gives you a certain amount of EVs when you faint or capture it and these EVs are specific to a certain stat. For example fainting a Zigzagoon will give any Pokemon involved in the battle  Speed EV. Fainting a Butterfree on the other hand yields  Special Attack and  Speed EV. The EVs that you receive from catching  fainting any Pokemon are all specific to each Pokemon and can be found on Bulbapedia or Serebii or just about any site.Every  EVs that a Pokemon gets in any one stat will raise that stat by one point. For example if you have your starter Pokemon faint  Zigzagoons itll gain one extra point in Speed. EVs max out at  for any one stat and  overall.Getting the Effort Ribbon basically means that your lead Pokemon has gotten  total EVs over the course of the game which isnt too hard if youve kept your Pokemon for a while.EV training is taking any Pokemon with  total EVs so either its freshly caughthatched or youve used a Reset Bag on it and then fainting  catching ONLY Pokemon that give the EVs you want. This can also be done in Super Training.Hope that clears things up!,pokemon,cmiijk9,1,t5_2qmeb

2548615,0,t1_cmr3dd3,I dont understand why youre so defensive about it its my opinion.  Also I never said Gen  had good design so dont try to put words in my mouth or try to act like I said those were examples of good design.  I said it was terrible not exclusively terrible nor did I imply that in any way.  There are obviously examples of bad design in all Pokemon generations.First and foremost Pokemon to me should be creatures hence more natural.  So all those things while some sillier than others are at least believable to me.  What I consider bad design is Pokemon modeled after manmade objects.  To me its extremely lacking in creativity.  But examples from Gen  Honedge evo. chain.  Sword gt double sword gt sword and shield.  Makes no sense as a Pokemon and very uninspired. Swirlix amp Slurpuff.  Pokemon based off cotton candy and cake? Really? Aromatisse.  Oh god what is that Klefki.  Its a key ring.  A key ring. Avalugg.  While I enjoy the idea of living land masses ie Lion Turtles in Avatar Avalugg just doesnt work.Honorable mentions Binacle Barbaracle.  Hahah what the hell.Not to mention the legendaries were very lackluster compared to previous generations.  Just because theyre shaped like X Y and Z doesnt make them creative design or a thematic fit.A lot of the Pokemon are just rehashed versions of older Pokemon as well.  We didnt need another electric mouse or another crab or another sea horse.  You could argue that other generations also did this but when you introduce a MUCH smaller Pokedex than normal rehashes dont exactly showcase creativity.,pokemon,cmr8ovt,1,t5_2qmeb

2595306,0,t1_cmx9it9,Since the odds are  of encountering a shiny in the wild its entirely reasonable to believe you could complete many playthroughs and never encounter one. Ive only ever encountered a Pidgey in Silver and hatched a Carvanha in Y. However if you purposefully hunt for a shiny via one of the methods its not unreasonable to average a shiny every couple hours. The easiest way is to just run around a friend safari for a couple hours until you hit one. The bonus to this method is theyll also have  perfect IVs. ,pokemon,cmxcdpu,4,t5_2qmeb

2628388,0,t3_2q0d7f,Youre a trainer not a Pokemon. Its a nostalgia thing for some and for some they play to raise train and breed Pokemon some want to complete the pokedex some play for a combination. Its designed for kids in the aspect of they can pick up and play. But it gets more complicated the more you look into the stats. There is strategy to leveling up training and breeding Pokemon. Natures moves and stats can be transferred through breeding. There are multipliers for attack defense  and so on. So its kind of like a RTS game in a sense. Its a lot of fun. If you have a ds or a DS you should pick up a game used to play. ,pokemon,cn1nyxr,1,t5_2qmeb

Guaranteed KOs dont occur until Oddish has very low IVs in those stats.   In this case actually the difference between  and  IVs can be noticeable. Assuming average IVs lets say  on the Oddish going from  to  in SpA changes the Shadow Ball from a guaranteed HKO to a  chance to HKO. This is assuming an Oddish with a neutral nature.   IVs are definitely important. Sucks that your shiny rolled . I would hate that. In this case on average it is hindering your ability to OHKO Oddishes.   Edit This is assuming no damage boosting items on Gengar. Spooky Plate for example increases your chance on Average Oddish to a  chance. ,pokemon,cn7697n,4,t5_2qmeb

2694348,0,t3_2qwtg3,I think the others have given you an idea of what they are. To make them more relevant basically in competitive play such as online or Battle Maison you need stronger Pokemon. These need to maximise their advantage and so have boost a for the stats they use. Why? Because thats what your opponent will probably do. You dont do it youre at a disadvantage.When you normally play Pokemon you may not notice these things. Firstly natures. These are things like Modest or Hasty that really increase one stat by  and decrease another by  or do nothing. So a fast physically attacking Pokemon could be Jolly so it has boosted speed and hindered special attack which it wouldnt even use.Next it needs IVs. These as mentioned are numbers that are equal to the extra stat points in those stats when it reaches lvl  and range from . These cannot be changed only randomly generated and passed down at breeding. So youd have to breed  IV Pokemon with your Pokemon to slowly build up these IVs. Finally you now have a  IV that means  or  stats all stats being HP Art Def SpA SpD Speed have perfect  or such IVs. But Game freak has an EV system as well. Basically you may have noticed that your Pokemon are stronger that wild Pokemon because theyve developed EVs. This has been explained in other comments. You can fight Pokemon each Pokemon yields a certain type and number of EVs such as  HP EVs or use the Super Training thing for the same effect.After all this with a good move set ability evolutionary stage level and held item you have a perfect competitive Pokemon ready to battle. ,pokemon,cna9qhf,1,t5_2qmeb

2712429,0,t1_cnc1oml,gt speedActually its speed is surprisingly decent for a NFE Pokemon its got  base speed which is faster than some fully evolved mons. Unfortunately thats pretty much where all of its stat points went...,pokemon,cnce4ux,1,t5_2qmeb
2712951,0,t1_cncf0bt,Sure Ill try my best to explain as simply as I can.Im bolding the important parts since this got REALLY longThe short version is that every pokemons  different stats HPAttacketc are determined by  things. A hidden value specific to each stat the IV nature increases one stat at the cost of decreasing another and EVs.IVs can be anywhere from . Basically what that means... Well heres an example. I have  of the same pokemon same nature everything except their attack IVs are different. One has  attack another has  attack. If the first pokemon at level  has  attack then the second pokemon at level  would have  attack.In other words whatever the IV is determines how many extra stat points you get at max level pretty sure thats how it works.Now nature is simple. Lets say that first pokemon is a Jolly nature. Jolly natured pokemon have  decreased special attack and  increased speed. So that first pokemon will have I think  attack.   .  . Its special attack would be lowered by  similarly final stat total  .  new final total. But you probably already know about this.If you need to know about EVs still Ill be happy to explain just let me know. I didnt cover it here because theyre different but you can change them at any time unlike IVs and natures.Anyways back to IVs. In the wild normally all  stats have totally random IVs. This does not include legendary pokemon in the recent gameslegendaries get  guaranteed perfect perfect   IV unless referring to a perfect battle ready pokemon which means it has the  relevant stats with  IVs IVs. If youre using DexNav the stars that appear next to the Potential category indicates how many IVs it has. Note that if all  stars are showing that simply means the wild pokemon has at least  perfect IVs. So  stars   perfect IVs.  stars   perfect IVs.In XY in the friend safari all pokemon were guaranteed to have  perfect IVs but only in friend safari.This isnt exactly a super simple version I know but IVs are a bit complicated or at least can be overwhelming at first.In my previous post when I mentioned IV I was basically saying that the pokemon had  stats in which the IV was .In competitive battling most people breed to get perfect IVs with the use of a destiny knot. The chance of finding a competitivelyperfect pokemon in the wild is astronomically low is why.I didnt understand most of it either for a long time but eventually I started breeding for competitive even though I dont play it like at all and I got the hang of it.I should mention that in the Battle Resort in the PokeCenter you can talk to a guy in front of the map who will check your pokemons IVs. Hell tell you the overall sum of the IVs Outstandingdecentetc. he doesnt say specifics then hell tell you of any stats that are  This attack stat couldnt be any better! or any stats that are  Wont be going anywhere with that low of a speed stat though!.Additional note is that for some pokemon having an IV of  can actually be considered perfect. For special attackers having  in HP Def SpAtk SpDef and Speed is usually perfect but having ALSO  is as good as the stats get for it unless going for hidden power but fuck hidden power. The reason being is swaggerconfusion type moves but you cant legitimately breed for that most of the time you have to rely on luck. A more common reason and example though is pokemon like Aegislash. You almost always want Aegislash to attack last so having a nature that is Speed and  IV speed is perfect and its something you breed for.This is probably a bit too much for ELI so Ill be happy to try to rephrase if I lost you somewhere.,pokemon,cncg9ss,7,t5_2qmeb

2716380,0,t3_2r5s3v,I like your theory!! I have my own theory actually too. I think theyre gonna go the whole BW route amp make like an XY but in these games since Xerneas is captured in X Yveltal will be summoned by a Neo Team Flare with the new Y version being the same except Xerneas being summoned by the new Team Flare as well. Team Flare will use the legendaries to cause some type of catastrophe upon the Kalos region amp then Zygarde will appear as it says in its pokedex entry when the Kalos regions ecosystem is thrown into disarray amp it will have  new forms Maybe an xy stone like Mewtwo amp Charizard? with each containing a new move to hit the opposing legendaries Thousand arrows to hit yveltal thousand waves to hit Xerneas!!,pokemon,cncub09,-1,t5_2qmeb

2716560,0,t1_cncr47b,Mind leading me to where Rotom is considered a legendary? This is the first Im hearing of this. Furthermore Manaphy coming from an egg doesnt interfere with any of the most common rules of being a legendary it just differs in that respect.And Im confused arent new evolutions for Pokemon according to you still again an opinion not well liked a good thing? Platinum is gen  no?Again thats still an opinion. I didnt appreciate gen s story many others loved it etc. Etc.Also it is still in Palkias and Dialgas capabilities to create worlds and universes its just that Arceus is original creator and by dex entries and other sources is heavily considered the god of Pokemon.Finally the last point is still all specution. Dex entries and the little info we get allow us to piece highly popular theories but no solid evidence. You see it is only stated that new contains the genetic info of all Pokemon. The extrapolation is that it is the ancestor taken from it is said. Arceus also is said to have shaped the world and from the sinjoh event to be able to literally create dpg and so the most popular theory is that arceus created mew to populate the world. While this is still all speculation it does clearly state that arceus created the world much more than mew.Your last point is valid though I dont think the obtainance of an event is such a major factor when again I stated that creation is possible by Palkia Dialga and Giratina. Just would like some clarification on those points. ,pokemon,cncv1hw,1,t5_2qmeb
2716837,0,t3_2r68tt,I saw a really good write up of how this would work a few years ago  it sounded absolutely amazing but I cant find it anymore. From memory it took the Zelda world plot and gameplay then mixed in pokemon.I wouldnt mind it with pokemon gameplay either. You play Link and set out from kokori forest with a grassfairy starter in order to defeat Ganondorf. On the way you need to visit various temples crawling with typethemed pokemon instead of a gym per se and puzzles. At the end instead of a gym leader you fight a psudolegendary pokemon as boss  only one available in the game but not really a legendary. For example the Water temple boss could be mega Blastoise.You have a sword and can cut grass on your journey to clear a path through the wild grass for next time you come along the route and to get rupees and items  wild pokemon still appear in grass but cutting it also has a chance of starting a battle probably with a higherthannormal levelled pokemon.In addition to HMs there would be some items the player can use like bombs instead of rock smash as well as mini games like fishing. The game would introduce a small number of Zeldathemed enemy pokemon that are only available for capture in this game but can be traded to others. For example a Poe would be a Ghosttype pokemon or maybe even a gastlyhaunter playing tricks that appears as a poe on the overworld and cant be battled but turns into a battleable ghost pokemon with the Eye of truth.  A Baby Dodongo pokemon Fire type that learns explosion and evolves into A Dodongo which further evolves into king Dodongo with a Kings rock. There could be Stalfos pokemon GhostSteel and a Likelike pokemon that steals items if it defeats you. A Keese pokemon with different forms Fire Keese ice Keese normal Basically when it becomes burnt it turns into a fireflying type and gets STAB. It gets moves that allow it to burn or freeze itself and an ability that lessens the damage for status ailments. What others can we think of?There would be less other pokemon trainers overall but still some Scattered around. Goron trainers would prefer rockfireground pokemon generally with some exceptions I imagine gorons and Quagsire would get along well. Gerudo trainers would prefer faster pokemon and desertthemed pokemon with some exceptions Sneasel? The temples would mostly be void of trainers but all the routes could have some. Once you have beaten the  or whatever temples you gain access to ganondorfs castle OoT is my favourite so I am heavily influenced by that where the Elite Four is Located  The Elite four have been corrupted by Ganondorf and when you defeat them they reawaken. Once you defeat them you fight Ganondorf who is champion and has  high level pokemon. Once you defeat him He turns into the games legendary Ganon which can be caught only with the Master Ball see what I did there? but only once it has been defeated.  I would Absolutely love it.,pokemon,cncw67u,5,t5_2qmeb

At least when youre gaming you are using your brain.I dont have accurate numbers but the average tv time in the US used to be at h a day. That is hours upon hours of being inactive and force fed content.You could also be reading but then again you wouldnt be using logic.Not all games are deep enough to challenge your critical thinking but pokemon is one of them. It also has a great community full of creative people and it encourages positive intetactions.You could also make it a familly thing.

2740648,0,t3_2rdr4i,I liked them. The only part I dislike actually is how slow the battles go. I would probably say the worst games are the Kanto ones both the originals and the remakes. The originals were full of bugs and the remakes just showed how boring a region Kanto is. Also stripping out the clock in the game and friendship wasnt a good choice either. As far as generations go I also think that after the first generation this one is the worst. There is no difficulty left in the series and both Xampy and ORAS feel pretty bare bones when it comes to postgame content. ORAS stands out in particular because the normal game is shorter than the originals because of how easy it is but it doesnt even make up with it in terms of content volume. Theres less postgame than emerald with the removal of the battle frontier and pretty much no new additions beyond the delta episode which was pretty mediocre to begin with. ,pokemon,cnflm8f,1,t5_2qmeb

Damn Im old.I used to watch the anime when I was growing up too. With the Sailor Moon remake having started I decided to go back and start watching all the pokemon. I havent seen any of the new shows but yeah Ash was annoying af and had everything handed to him. Grats on your pity badges Ash!He improves a lot by the time Orange Islands roll around. Im just about finished the Johto series now and Ash has come a lot farther in his character development than what he used to be though Brock has become annoying with his fawning over anything with a set of boobs larger than Mistys.As for the manga Im currently reading the Diamond amp Pearl Platinum adventures. Not bad but kinda cheese as the main two characters are a couple wannabe comedians so every now and then you have some comedy routine they burst into that frankly should have been left out of the comic entirely.,pokemon,cnghzfw,1,t5_2qmeb

You could breed a female Tyranitar with a male Avalugg that knows Curse since Avalugg is on the list of Pokmon that can pass down the Egg Move to Tyranitar. You could also choose to use a Slowbro or a Torterra as the father instead since theyre also on the list.

2891566,0,t1_cnwrjt4,That is a very common question. There are really two main approaches to teambuilding Select a core of Pokemon you want to use and build around it. This is by far the most common approach for newer players. Select a playstyle and fill out your roster to support it. This takes some experience with the game to do effectively so you know who fills what roles in what ways. For now well go with selecting a cornerstone as you say.The EASIEST way to do this is to start with a mega evolution you want to use. You are not required to use a mega but its very easy to build a solid team around one. Next take a look at its strengths and weaknesses. Who is strong against this mega? Who is weak to it? Pick a few team members that will cover those weaknesses. The magic number is . Most cores are three Pokemon that you can shuffle around to cover each other against their threats. After youve built up a core like that you need to flesh it all out with other solid picks. Here you can either pick some offensive threats or defensive pivots to make your team more robust. You cant really go wrong with picking the boring standard OU goodstuffs. Talonflame LandorusT RotomW Latias Heatranthese things are standard for a reason. Theres no shame in using them on your team dont be afraid of being standard.

2894075,0,t3_2t9cnp,Okay I dont know too much about OU but this is what I can tell you from looking at this teamIf you want to replace Protect on Charizard either have it be Dragon Pulse as you want or maybe something like Ancient Power  Hidden Power Rock or Hidden Power Ice for pesky landorus.That Play Rough probably wont be very good on Klefki with its mediocre Attack. Try Foul Play instead. However if youre concerned about coverage you may keep Play Rough.Scizor looks good to go but can you tell me what you did with the  EVs in Defense?Snorlax looks good too.It looks like you wanted Hidden Power Fire on your Venusaur but you decided against it. You should change those IVs to  if you want that extra point of attacking prowess. Also could you mind telling me what you wanted to outspeed with  Speed EVs?Blastoise looks good too. It is possible that you could run a Water move even on a Sun team if the sun fades away so you can possibly utilize Torrent. But it looks like you used Blastoise purely because of Spinning. You could use Latias as a slightly bulky Defog user as non mega Blastoise doesnt fare very well in the metagame I think. A recommended set by Smogon is this    Latias  Life Orb    Ability Levitate    EVs  HP   SpA   Spe    Timid Nature     Defog     Draco Meteor     Hidden Power Fire  Psyshock  Thunderbolt     Healing Wish  RoostAlso why do you have the levels set to ?

There is an NPC in one of the games I think Gen  that mentions something about witnessing an egg literally just poof into existence before her eyes. Dont quote me on that but I believe that is what she says. Its been a while since I played any of those games.This along with that event where you can get Arceus to make you a Dialga Palkia or Giratina egg leads me to believe that Arceus himself may actually just be zapping the eggs into existence in a stork delivering a baby kind of way. This would explain why all Pokemon are oviparous why small Pokemon can still have eggs that are larger than them why eggs can be produced in a matter of minutes and why no one has ever witnessed a Pokemon lay an egg.Also Ditto is not the one unable to breed with legendaries I think the legendaries are the ones who are unable to breed with Ditto.,pokemon,cnxfog2,17,t5_2qmeb

2906942,0,t3_2tf8f0,Heres what Ive gathered from looking online I dont own either of them.. The official guide seems to have some really middling reviews. Its split into two volumes. The first volume contains information about the main story of the game and provides maps item locations and presumably stuff like trainer Pokemon and whatnot. It essentially looks like a walkthrough of the game. It doesnt contain a Pokedex or anything to that effect. The second volume includes information about content available after beating the Pokemon champion  which is basically just some side quests. This includes a Pokedex with information about the roughly  Pokemon that can be caught in X and Y. It also has details about some of the updated game mechanics.. The unofficial guide seems to be a starter guide in general for Pokemon giving some overview to how the game is played a short summary of the games story and some beginner level gameplay tips. It doesnt seem to be a walkthrough or anything so I imagine the information in this one is more geared to somebody who has never played Pokemon before.If I had to pick one for a Pokemon player I would have to judge how well they know the game. I dont know how old your son is or how much of the game he has completed but Ill give my opinion of the .Buy volume  of the official guide if your son has not beaten the game and wants information to help him get to and beat the champion. Id also associate this with being somewhat young. I didnt have any trouble at all completing the game but I could see a younger kid perhaps  or under having a little trouble here or there.Buy volume  of the official guide if your son is either a little bit older above  Id say or if he has already beaten the champion. This provides more information about what can be done in the game after youve beaten the champion. This guide is probably better for helping collect all of the Pokemon available in X and Y.Buy the unofficial guide if hes new to Pokemon and just getting started with the game. Based on what I read this provides basic tips tricks and strategy for playing the game and should provide a decent introduction to the game.I will be honest though I was not impressed with the reviews of the guides. I remember them being very good when I was younger. Maybe Im just older and more cynical now though.,pokemon,cnyiybf,2,t5_2qmeb

It would be gamblers fallacy to think that Thunder missing and hitting before hand had an effect on any other usages of thunder but it is not a gamblers fallacy to say that the chances of thunder hitting missing in that particular order has an x chance. Like gamblers fallacy would be to say this coin has landed heads  times in a row the next one must be tails because its imblanaced or something. In reality the statistical chance of each individual coin flip is for arguments sake  but when looked as a whole to say The chances of a coin landing heads  times in a row is a  in  chance is not incorrect. That being said it would be just as correct to say The chances of a coin landing heads heads tails heads tails is  in  as what youre ultimately calculating is what are the chances of this particular sequence off outcomes being the outcomes that I receive,pokemon,cnza8yy,31,t5_2qmeb

2931085,0,t1_co18xle,Youre right. Emerald is my favorite Pokemon game mostly due to to being my first real one Didnt have a Gameboy and played Ruby with a friend on his GBA and Colosseum on GC. I later got a DS with Diamond  Emerald and I was disapointed in mostly two things  The gyms and how I got Latios and Rayquaza.I may be biaised since I wasnt familiar with Pokemon when I completed Emerald the first time Being  yo now but I found the gyms really easy. I did nearly everything with my Scpetile and was disapointed with gym leaders having two or three pokemons same for MagmaAqua leaders... I wasnt excited at all at the idea of fighting them.Getting LatiosLatias was a huge achievement for me back in the day. I was not aware of how to stop them from running away and wasted my Master Ball on Rayquaza. Getting Latios in the Story was a disapointement seemed forced and easy.For Rayquaza its just the grinding of the tower who felt different. Being able to fall through holes and having to go fast with the Bicycle was funny  MegaRayquaza without a gem is stupid.Apart of this Im enjoying the game a lot. Getting the legendaries without spoilers is a fun experience and the game is good just too easy for some things.,pokemon,co19y1g,2,t5_2qmeb

2979002,0,t3_2uaxs3,I am spending the weekend in Osaka so I got to try Pokken Tournament at Namco Land today. We went pretty late at night so they were out of those commemorative NFC cards but there was hardly any line so we each got to play twice after a short wait. First reactions I thought it was incredibly fun even though I didnt fully understand all the mechanisms and am not a huge fan of fighters. I played one round as Suicune and one as Lucario. Suicune played really interestingly for being fourlegged and was actually more fun for me than Lucario although I was able to pull off Lucarios special attacks easier. The assist pokemon were a unique touch that when I got the hang of them made the game more fun. There is a two phase system that I dont understand. Maybe someone can explain what it says about it in the pamphlet better. Also the controller is actually okay but I can imagine fighting game enthusiasts not liking it.

While this is interesting and the shadows make a nice effect especially around the ears the whole thing looks flat. If you hadnt told me you did this in blender I would have thought you tried to apply some sort of stained glass effect to a picture of bulbasaur in Photoshop. In comparison your Samus one has some visible depth to it with the solidified walls and the harsh color on the walls makes for a nice neon effect something you dont really get with this bulbasaur,pokemon,co74von,1,t5_2qmeb

Japan and the UK are. The world does not consist of Japan the UK and the US. Your comments make it sound like you think the US should get badass events but dont care about any of the other countries that also arent getting good events  even though the US and UK generally get all the good events other than Japans and a lot of other countries are far worse off.

That phrase there is definitely something that Id agree with AG and DP Ash as well.  I always see people here saying that Ash always gets reset when he goes to a new region because it has become some dumb meme at this point but its just not true.

3140660,0,t1_con6e4t,gtThe fact that youre seeing those trades means they are NEVER completedQuite the opposite  people will often do this to trade Pokemon between versions with only one system. For instance someone might put up the trade Fletchling for Keldeo on XY and then make the trade on ORAS moving their Keldeo from one to the other. Of course its easier with Pokemon Bank but this is just a nice method of moving single ones.,pokemon,coniyil,5,t5_2qmeb

3144199,0,t3_2w5uux,I recommend picking one game from each generation preferably the third one crystalemeraldplatinum if its available. This will help you have the potential to see both legendsthe third legend etc. easier. If you dont want to play anything preds heartgoldsoulsilver is a good alternative to goldsilvercrystal however I personally believe that omega rubyalpha sapphire doesnt convey the rubysapphireemerald hoenn experience as well. Thats just my opinion though.My personal recommendation in terms of order to play the games is rubysapphireemerald preferably emerald heartgoldsoulsilver diamondpearlplatinum preferably platinum blackwhite blackwhite not technically necessary but theyre a nice storyline imo xy then omega rubyalpha sapphire.If you want to play some vintage gen pokemon games online I recommend playr.org to save you do need to make an account but its free and easyRed | Blue | Green English patch if youre interested in that | Yellow | Gold | Silver | CrystalAs for movies Ill admit I havent watched very many of the recent ones but if you have something like Netflix see if you can find any movies there.

You can fly directly to routes as wellThe battle Frontier has been replaced by a thing called battle maison which is actually kind of niceContests are backI think all pokemon can be caught between ORAS and XY if Im not mistaken aside from eventsBreeding is pretty popular for making pokemon with moves only accessible through breedingThere are hidden abilities on pokemon that are just pretty much a a different ability than they usually haveThe pokemon are no longer sprites as much as  dimensional characters which is refreshing if you havent looked up a lot on the new pokemon gamesThey have something called wonder trade where you can trade random pokemon with random people all over the worldHoenn has Mirage spots that appear at different times and hold foreign pokemonLots of berriesYou can have pals in your secret base which is pretty neatTheres currently an event where you can get  starter pokemon each with their hidden abilities all from gen Cant think of anymore but hopefully this helps a bit! ,pokemon,cou8cj8,2,t5_2qmeb

3285166,0,t1_cp2nu9k,This is a ridiculous statement. Youre basically saying that the point of the entire game which is raising the pokemon you use is a waste of time. You might argue that battling is what you really want to do but it takes a hilariously easy amount of time to make a viable team. It took me like  days of moderate playtime to make almost a box of competitive pokemon that I wanted to breed just because. I dont consider that unreasonable.But for arguments sake lets assume it is SO UNREASONABLE to breed pokemon from time to time because you want to try out different teams. I proffer that plenty of online simulators exist especially Pokemon Showdown wherein you are not literally hacking pokemon into your ds. These simulators provide every possible amenity including widely varying rulesets complete with ladders of varying competitiveness. Certainly the average player on those ladders especially for the most popular formats is going to be better than some random you challenge in your game.Further after finding a team you like you can then hunt and breed those pokemon ingame! Why devalue  of the point of having games in the first place? The games are not just about battling. If youre aiming to be proficient at the game of pokemon and I assume you are because you stated that you wanted perfect pokemon and teams I argue that advocating blatant cheating as somehow the only legitimate way of playing is at best hilariously off base and at worst poisoning the spirit of the games.edit Id also like to note that the average player is not going to use breeding facilities heavily and is not going to need anything close to a perfect team thus the average user will not be so bored to tears by a core function of the competitive scene like so many people blatantly violating the ethical standards gamefreak wants us to comport with seem to be.,pokemon,cp2qhdu,10,t5_2qmeb

I will be using a Staraptor with  HP less than perfect for Suicune and a Smeargle with  less Speed and Spore plus a synchronizer So about as effecient as I can get. Just getting these things together to begin soft resetting took me  hours.Now the SR process could be kind to me and maybe Ill have one today but It still may take a while. Theres no way I could do a process like this  times in the span of  days when I factor in real life responsibilities.

He may get wings for the Yveltal form and I can imagine the Xerneas one having legs and turning more lizardlike. I would probably get ZX if he ended up how I imagine him with X form.

3346696,0,t1_cp9qiih,I dont know if it happens will all Pokemon but if I remember it happened when I was  or  and has never happened since. Its done with a Gameshark and a VisualBoyAdvance because codes can be disabled immediately on emulators.You need a Wild Pokemon Modifier code and a Shiny code Level modifier code optional. While the codes are active get into a random encounter with the desired modifications in place. Once youve either ran or caught the Pokemon exit the tall grass and remove all codes.At this point none of the codes are technically active but there are still some bits of it that remain so long as you dont reset the game or close the emulator. So sometimes you get stuff like male Periwinkle Mews since the code from the cheat device hasnt fully reset. ,pokemon,cp9qyu9,1,t5_2qmeb

3438055,0,t3_2zkyrf,Favourite?  Lance.  He runs  Dragonites and Hyper Beamed a dude.  Have to respect that.Least?  Probably Diantha just because she only appears in a small cameo before the finale and shes easily the least challenging.  Blues your rival throughout RBY  so theres an awesome sense of finality to his fight.  Lance helps you out in Mahogany and hows off his Dragonite which leaves you with a big impression.  Reds fuckin Red.  The ultimate final boss.  Steven is a huge part of RSEORASs plot has an awesome Mega in ORAS and is a great post game battle for Emerald.  Wallace was just a really tough battle and it was cool to see him ascend from Gym Leader.  Cynthia has a similar role to Steven and acts as BWs Red fight while having a balanced but powerful team.  Alder pops up now and then in BW and you dont get to fight him until postgame so his team is strong as fuck in your first fight.  Iris has a cool team cool background and the whole Gym leader ascension thing.  Diantha just exists.  Youd think the first champion with a mega would be more threatening but even without the EXP share shes a fuckin pushover..  I wish Wallys ultimate team didnt require beating a Battle Maison Super Chatelaine.  By the time hes available to battle you naturally outclass him.  If you didnt youd have never beaten the Maison.  Would have been nice to have a Redesque battle with his awesome theme in the rose field postDelta Episode.  That would have been awesome.  He could have been the new Red.,pokemon,cpk5wux,4,t5_2qmeb

Even now I have a journal of progress for certain pokemon I use including a mockdiary and pictures of my hunting for them or hatching their eggs. I dont need to be the best Im not overly competitive I just want to feel like theyre the best and Ill do my best for them. Gruelling training has its perks and being an Ace Trainer is tough but maintaining a ranch of various Pokemon all with their own personalities and life stories has always been a favourite fantasy of mine. Oak maybe just a researcher but hes living the life. A celebrity self employed living a fun life and is always finding new and wonderful things about the world around him while others will spend years trying to follow in his footsteps and impress him. Yet all he does is eat sushi write poetry play with Pokemon and use his complimentary V.I.P ticket to anything ever. Only difference is if I was him Id have a Pokemon partner with me . Even when Im old and wanting them to go out and have adventures with the new generations I would still keep one. What I wouldnt give to be a young Samuel Oak.,pokemon,cpofxun,9,t5_2qmeb

I drew them over the course of the last few months and most of them took under an hour to draw.I see what youre saying about backgrounds lacking refinement but there are a couple of things there.Im planning to do all  so the most important thing for me is to get the feel of each one right and then if I really want to I can polish them later. If I focus too much on making each one flawless Ill burn out in notime. For most of these I stop when I feel like its strong enough for me to be able to add on to later even if there are still things left to improve.There is also the fear of overworking something. If at a certain moment I dont feel like I know what it is that I need to add I stop. For a few of them I tried to polish and I felt like they lost their charm or movement so I actually reverted to messier versions. But at the end of the day its just a side project and I have to be careful about conserving energy for other artrelated work that I do. ,pokemon,cppg0at,3,t5_2qmeb

3499478,0,t1_cpr4jt1,Many people say its because you can sell your high karma reddit account but I really think its more of a pissing match.  It happens on both ends of the spectrum for both positive karma and negative.  There are entire communities dedicated to tracking and playing games with both.  Theres one guy that is going for record high link karma and record low comment karma.  Hes doing really well.  I think hes disappointed that he gets more link upvotes than comment downvotes but thats the nature of the system.  Normally only people with strong opinions about posts come into the comments section.  Many many people just upvote scroll upvote scroll.

3539378,0,t3_30sow4,Ill probably answer this differently every time its asked since there are just so many to choose from but one of my favorites of all time is Steelix. Gen  is generally my favorite Gen since its where I really started to get into Pokemon so a lot of Gen  Pokes make my top list. Steelix and to an extent Scizor is different from all of though simply because there wasnt an easy way to get it. You had to trade and trading was a bigger pain in the ass back then than it is now so I never had a Steelix as a kid. The rarity of trade evolutions is what made me like and want them the most. Steelix Scizor Alakazam Kingdra and Politoed are all some of my favorites but Steelix interested me the most. Steel is my favorite type so it really came down to Steelix and Scizor but Steelix won out probably due to Scizors lack of exposure in Gen .Naturally when I heard he was getting a Mega I was ecstatic and Mega Steelix is probably one of my favorite Megas of all. Mega Houndooms pretty cool too though.,pokemon,cpvpml6,3,t5_2qmeb

I wouldnt use Primal Groudon because his sun deactivates once hes switched out and unless youre doing double battles its not going to help you at all.Another option is to use HP Grass over Solar Beam. Sure the power drop would be a pain but at least with this you dont need any prior set up to use it. Also Im pretty sure it goes without saying but make sure you have a hazard remover on your team too.

Lysandre is the embodiment of the let them eat cake attitude of Frances prerevolution ruling class hes a ruler who became a tyrant when his privilege made it impossible for him to empathize with his subjectsFirstly didnt Lysandre speak poorly of his lineage? Secondly at far as we know he attempted to use his priviledge Im not sure that he was handed everything either for the benefit of everyone.At least to me Lysandres efforts to gain power werent just for powers sake. Maybe the game fooled me. But the description simplifies him to something he isnt and part of the reason I enjoyed XampY is that Lysandre seemed genuine.,pokemon,cq8jdta,5,t5_2qmeb

3725536,0,t1_cqg2epl,He stopped somewhere during the middle of the Indigo League actually He only wanted to catch them all because Gary did because of their childish pissing match to be the best thing ever. It was Professor Oak who more or less told them that theres multiple ways to catch train and enjoy Pokemon and those different ways are no more right or wrong than the other. And to be perfectly honest the same applies to the games. One person may very well want to catch them all but another person might not care about the collecting aspect. One person could like shiny hunting while another person could care less about it one person could like various mingames or sidequests e.g. Contests Musicals Secret Bases PokeAthalon breeding etc. while others may not. One may play the games competitvely one may play casually and one may like both.They even make characters in the various canons to prove this. The X and Y games have the four rivals that represent this the anime would later introduce other main characters interested in things outside of battling while Pokemon Adventures has each character have their own unique talent e.g. Gold breeds Crystal collects Silver trades Yellow heals Ruby does contests Sapphire does Gym battles etc..  ,pokemon,cqgxq6u,2,t5_2qmeb

3755839,0,t1_cqkc4lv, heres the linkThey are definitely bootleg. Note how yours compare to the official one in the photo I linked before. The Leafeon pokedoll thats the official name of the chibi plush youre referring to. It was an official plush made in both Japan and the US. It is no longer in production now thats why you dont see it on the Pokemon Centers website. When it was available in the US it was only at Nintendo World and the Pokemon Center kiosks in Washington. The doll was the same but the tag was different see here Now whoever youre buying from is definitely a bootlegger. Just look at the quality difference to see how different the plush are. And the official pokedolls from Japan are only available from Pokemon Centers in Japan the US ones used to just be available at Nintendo World and the Washington kiosks but now recently theyve been selling plush at walmart and Target. But I digress.. The point is The Pokemon Company does not distribute its pokedolls to third party sellers especially at such a low price that thirdparty sellers can sell them for . there are thirdparty sellers who sell official plush but they purchase them at retail price at the Pokemon Center and resell them so in order to make a profit and cover import and shipping fees from Japan the item ends up being a lot more than . Look man Im sorry to be such a downer. You seem like an honest person sorry if I sounded harsh earlier. But good on you for trying to find out the truth. Its easy to just get tricked into believing cheap plush like those are official. The real world of Pokemon collecting can be a lot more expensive but when you get official merch you are supporting The Pokemon Company and getting a much better quality product. I think TCP has caught on to the demand for their merch outside of Japan at least because of their recent opening of the pokemoncenter.com store and bringing a lot of formerly Japanexclusive merch back to the states at an affordable price. If you need more help identifying bootlegs please feel free to come join us over at PKMNCollectors on LJ  theres a lot of friendly and knowledgable people there happy to helpEdit to addIt sounds like you did invest in these and bought them in bulk. I dont want to make you feel like that was a waste or anything x.x What you could do is keep selling them but perhaps make it clear its unofficial if someone asks. There are people who dont care and would rather pay  for a cheaper one than  for the official. In some ways its a good alternative for someone who absolutely cant afford to buy a plush thats no longer in production. Many pokedolls can cost  so the bootleg is a good alternative for fans of that particular pokemon.  I think the most important thing at least is education and honesty so customers know what they are getting. ,pokemon,cqke5v2,2,t5_2qmeb

Based on type advantage alone you will really use Hawlucha and Marowak more than your other Pokemon with Meowstic being used least out of them all after Aegislash. But that aside make sure to remember to have fun and take things slow with the game so you can enjoy it to the fullest extent. ,pokemon,cr9kk1u,2,t5_2qmeb

4060126,0,t3_371ews,Im actually replaying White  again with a Tepig as well!!. I just beat the rd gym leader. Instead of sharing my team though Ill just square with you who I feel are some of the best pokemonWhite  is like Platinum and HeartGold in that a lot of the earlygame mons are fantastic for the later game. In fact just the first route has a friend you can call your own forever Lillipup. Its usability only falters right at the Elite Four and by then you should have a team to take on the rest. Riolu Azurill and Mareep are in the farm near the beginning route they evolve into Lucario Azumarill and Ampharos respectively. However since theyre practically babies theyll need to be babysat for a while before they grow into their excellent final forms. Still train Riolu enough for a good fighting type move and you can destroy the first gym in no time.If Mareeps not your style for electric type Magnemite can be caught near the second gym and can wall that particular gym leader pretty well since steel is completely immune to poisonRoute  and the Desert Resort not accessible until after beating Burgh the rd gym leader is my favorite route ingame because it has so many good mons. Sandshrew if you need something familiar from the first generations otherwise consider Sandile. Trapinch can turn into Flygon which is pretty fantastic since its ground and dragon plus it can fly. Scraggy is dark and fighting which is nearperfect typing in White  and definitely a thing to try and bet. If you wanna bench your Tepig Darumaka and Darmanitan are probably the fire types to beat in this game.Apparently Castelia Park has Petilil which is also a very good grasstype very nice looking very strong but only after you beat Burgh.There are three Pokemon that are practically given to you ingame that you should consider Braviary since you have White  Zoroark and Cinccinno. Zoroark and Cinccinno for sure since Braviary is only there to catch on Mondays. When the story events leading you to Zoroark and Cinccinno happen remember theyre there to help you.These are just suggestions  theres a lot in the game to catch  I think. Thats a big number and there are a lot of fantastic Pokemon after these later in the game you may could replace your party with. Hope this helps some.,pokemon,crj31vj,2,t5_2qmeb

The reason they didnt bring it back because people hyped so hard over wanting battle frontier they could never live up to peoples expectations.  That was the reason they gave and I honestly believe them.  Its the same thing thats happening with the Star Wars battlefront remake  and people are bitching so hard about so many things and the game isnt even out yet.  But thats an argument for anther time and place.  As for post game content did you complete the Delta episode?  That was a decent amount of post game.  More than Ive seen in a long time.  All Im saying is  youre criticizing the game over a personal problem you have.  The target audience is still children so they have to focus on putting just enough content in without over whelming them and having just enough so they dont lose interest.  in my opinion I dont give a shit about the battle frontier  I loved both ORAS games  have put  hours into both copies and still play them.  ,pokemon,crlzxxx,0,t5_2qmeb

Jotho is season  and Hoenn was decent it got stuff done but it was nothing to gag over. Hoenn  revisit of kanto are seasons    and . Also Mid way thru the season  voice actors for quite a few characters change... so if you spent  seasons watching it in a row... it is a weird change.Sinnoh is what I am currently watching right now its reaaally boring. After  seasons it has almost nothing newinteresting to offer I am currently at season  but I hear people say it doesnt get much better. Sinnoh saga lasts since season  to season .With season  it starts with Unova. I have not seen this yet. But I hear its not really good. People seem to dislike the main cast of those seasons. And it doesnt seem fun as I said thats what others sayAnd with season  you start Kalos part of the anime. I still havent seen this one but people say that it is really good.

Free nerfing of one o the best offensive types a lot of solid attacks with few drawbacks plus only Dragons Grass and other Waters resist it all of whom hate having to deal with Scalds Burns albeit for different reasons free boost to one of the worst defensive types neutrality against Rock would also help especially for Stealth Rock free Scaldwalls and makes flavorsense.Being supereffective against Water would also be nice but Ice is already a pretty nice attacking type so itd be just a nice bonus.

4310460,0,t1_csbblg0,Sorry if it came off that way of course doubles require skill! If anything what I meant was more that singles are more easily decided by a single good lucky switchprediction while doubles games arent swung just because your opponent predicted your switch perfectly. Mind games require knowing your opponents options and what theyre likely to do but it doesnt automatically mean someone is more skilled.Saying that Doubles strategy begins before the game starts suggests that the same thing isnt true about singles though. In both games building a team is extremely important. You have to know what threats exist and how you can answer them. Singles also requires choosing the correct lead just like doubles which can give either player a massive advantage if done correctly. Personally Ive spent a lot of time playing both and to be honest I usually stick to other formats than OU and Doubles. Doubles is really fun to watch like I said but neither is really my speed as far as playing Little Cup fo life!.,pokemon,csbik5w,2,t5_2qmeb

You dont have to train the Pokemon you just pick them and make them fight. Through trial and error Im sure he can beat the game with rentals only I beat both Stadiums at around his age maybe a little younger and he will have an accomplishment that even most veterans cant say theyve done without using a turnbyturn strategy guide.At his age hes unlikely to appreciate the difficulty of using rentals and hes unlikely to complain. At  all hes likely to care about is being able to battle Pokemon in what seems like the big leagues. If he gets too frustrated though Id suggest either emulating a main series game or buy him a used DSDS and a couple games in the case of the classic DS you could probably get him the system and a copy of a thgen game for under .,pokemon,csin4j8,1,t5_2qmeb

Like Red or Gold Ethan.Customization is what made XY that much more enjoyable. It was like seeing a kid version of me running around. However following Pokmon would also be awesome.

The only things viable at all in the OU meta that would resist its STABs after mega evolving are MegaZard X Latis Hydreigon  and Tyrantrum.   If you assume that its also getting Thousand Arrows then wipe out Latis and Hydreigon.   Not to mention the crazy mind games you could play. You risk losing your check counter if they dont mega evolve. All of the pokemon that can take resist a hit inherently will get hit with a supereffective attack before mega evolving.  No outrage immunity and only other dragons resist it... Only Levitate users and those on a balloon are immune to EQ and nothing is immune to Thousand Arrows although thats true without inverse. I dont see a way this thing wouldnt get banned in OU even if the stat ups are a little mediocre.

4606311,0,t3_3e222u,What if the Pokemon doesnt forget the move but Trainers your RPG player dont keep track of more than  moves?Like if Pokemon were real life you wouldnt have a DS telling you what moves your Pokemon knows. In the anime EP the main characters were given rental Pokemon to use but Ash had to take guesses on what his rental Pokemon knew. And logically speaking how could a Pokemon know how to use Hydro Pump yet forget Water Gun? And in several but less in newer episodes occasions a Pokemon would be able to use at least  different moves in the same episode.Of course this is drawing connections between game and anime references. In the game its all decided by a certain algorithm in the program so theres nothing much to look into there other than code.tldr  Pokemon dont forget moves Trainers are only able to keep track of  moves at a time.,pokemon,ctb7kyu,1,t5_2qmeb

4632963,0,t1_ctddyjo,I don get all the complaints about the new exp share. I just immediately turned it off when I received it. When I want to evolve some pokemon for my dex I deposit all but one pokemon on my main team usually my starter who I dont mind being a little over leveled or a pokemon what is weak against the next gym leader so it balances out eventually anyways and grind away. I dont see the problem with having less of a level grind when I want to play casually or making the game easy for kids who may find the level grinding too tedious and would rather play angry birds or something. You can easily put back in whatever challenge is lost by turning the damn thing off during normal play andor depositing the pokemon you dont want to over level. Really it feels like gaining exp from catching pokemon seems like the fastest way to over level your pokemon now that the dexnav made catching wild pokemon fun again. I used to level grind my starter at the beginning of the game but now all I have to do is catch one of every pokemon on the route and can achieve the same level with zero grinding whatsoever.,pokemon,ctejyno,1,t5_2qmeb

As for the study this was a survey of  teenagers in Canada so while not the most iron clad study it definitely agrees with much of what I have witnessed in the wild. Heres the articleAnd honestly I would predict that cyber bullying would just invite nontraditional groups to engage in the bullying since social hierarchy is not readily visible online hence why there seems to be more vitriol and many supposed neckbeards joining the fray of demeaning and aggressive comments.

4681671,0,t3_3f0lfp,People complain about this a lot and this is my answer to it.Type matchups in the game vs the anime have different nuances to them. Yes electric hurts water more in either case. But because the anime involves sentient creatures with the ability to explore space and move around they can do things like affecting another pokemons anatomy or aiming for the horn. Theres no double switching or pursuit trapping in the anime because there doesnt have to be. In the games they dont have that freedom so it has to be more methodical and RPGlike.,pokemon,ctko654,14,t5_2qmeb

I do not get why its Dark aside from the starters themes.Lapras WaterPsychic. It cannot live without being in water I assume. It shouldnt need the ice typing as if its Water it should just need the ability to control water therefore make ice. Its not internally subzero or anything like Glalie so it shouldnt be ice. It lives in tropical climates ffs.Flygon GroundDragon. It lives in and controls deserts. Its also a dragon. Aint nothing there.Garchomp DragonGround. It has similar features as a shark but dragon encompasses a lot of features. Gliscor PoisonFlying. Why make it have to have Ground? Makes no sense.Giratina GhostDragon makes sense as its an otherworldunderworld Pokemon. Its basically the Devil in the creation myth. Not necessarily evil though just part undead and neverdying. Therefore Ghost.DialgaPalkia I agree with you as they are there to control and maintain time and space. But two psychicdragons would be a drag.Seismitoad WaterGround.

That was actually supposed to be the point of my granted somewhat overlong post.  Everyone likes what they like and theres no reason to change that.  However some designs are going to be more creative and effective than others and that is something that is more objective.  Thats not to say you are obliged to like something because its creative I mostly just want people to stop using the words creative when they really mean I like this and unoriginal when they really mean I dont like this.  Just say you like it or you dont itll be more accurate.,pokemon,ctufypt,5,t5_2qmeb

I work a decent job that pays me and my family to live more than comfortably. I enjoy Pokemon. My wife knows it and so does my kid. My buddies from work or from college know it.

I never got any of the games after those though. After Red and Blue I spent most of my time on my PSOnePSN and practically forgot about Gameboy and handheld gaming altogether. It wasnt until last year when I downloaded an emulator on my phone that I got back into Pokmon. I saw FireRed and downloaded it to my phone. All the nostalgia hit me like a ton of bricks. I noticed all the new things like abilities characteristics natures and thought Damn what is all this stuff??. I asked my gf how the newer Pokmon games were and then she showed me X and Y and I was blown away. A couple weeks later I bought a new ds and Pokmon X and introduced myself to five generations of Pokmon Ive never seen before. Today I switch between ORAS and X frequently as theyre the only games I play on my ds lol. Im also trying to finish the dex have  caught and  seen so Im slowly getting there.

In the movies a young Prof Oak is shown interacting with a plethora of Gen  Pokemon  so he knows they exist! Discounting the movies due to partial canonicity if people can search for Mew in far off jungles and clone it Im fairly certain they know about the Pokemon and towns literally just over some mountains. Plus Blaziken is shown in Gen  how does it evolve so quickly if it has just been discovered? My theory is one the games are constructing themselvesand these are very clear in the games!Alternative timelines of all regions exist with varying native Pokemon appearing with some Champions and Gyms switched around. RBY was the original timeline GSCRSEFRLG were the secondary timelines DPPHGSSBWBW were the third timelines and the current timelines are ORASXY due to new typing the AZ War and Mega Evolution due to the War. It also hints about Pokemon in far off regions so this current timeline doesnt exclude any possible future games making it the most stable and inclusive timeline.Of course RBY were never meant to expect sequels. When they were greenlit by chance it was miraculous that GSC sold as well as it did and gave the franchise life to date I vote it the best sequel over BW. Obviously this cant be reflected in the games. The real answer in lore is the alternate timelines.,pokemon,cu48wc8,2,t5_2qmeb

4877646,1,t1_cu99dlf,gt Let me stop you with the Sun Stone right there. Sun Stone was most likely created so that the Moon Stone would have a counterpart.Conceptually sure but there is no real utility counterpart. Sunkern is in no way a counterpart to Jigglypuff. Gloom is in no way a counterpart to Nidorino. The relationship isnt there at allgt  Without any real way to give her an extra evolution outside of an item the Sun Stone was really the best choice.There are plenty of ways heck they introduced ways. Happiness as atrocious as it is would thematically work perfectly take the miserable rafflesia treat it like a princess and it becomes a joyful hula dancer but they could have used Kings Rock if they wanted to it would have made as much sensegt And the other is a bloody sunflower which completely justifies the use of a Sun Stone over a Leaf Stone.I dont believe a single pokemons legitimate use of an item necessitates the items existence. In fact thats the exact problemthat so many of these evolution items only exist for a single Pokemon. The game would be far better designed if it didnt have so many redundant unintuitive itemsgt  How are they supposed to give all of these old Pokemon new evolutions without creating plot holes?They do it all the time. They introduce new types new moves new abilities that they couldnt arbitrarily learn before. Even in some evolutions Lickitung could always learn Rollout ever sense Rollout was an attack. The playerbase has no issue understanding that in new games pokemon can learn new moves or have a second ability they never had before just cuswhy should evolutions need a special justification?gt  but from a game design point its just necessary.Thats the whole point it isnt. From a world design perspective its useful justification to keep games semiconsistent between iterations but from a game design perspective especially the current basically only one use leads to severe item bloat and unintuitive gameplay.,pokemon,cu9d5hl,0,t5_2qmeb

4904431,0,t3_3i0uk1,N is the perfect rival and Team Plasma the best though not perfect villainous team. BW had the deepest story I felt with the most realistic depictions of the human condition. Their motivation was actually legitimate and understandable as opposed to all the other baddies who just wanted to wreck shit for the sake of wrecking shit. And N was a great rival because you were able to sympathize with him and see him as an actual person rather than just an opponent. Thats important to me in fiction. Villains should be depicted as human because otherwise theyre flat and boring. I feel kinda weird saying that about N though because he was hardly a villain. He was just a misguided kid.

With so many ways to reduce electric type damaging move to zero I completly understand preparing thundurus with prankster.Kangama over usage was kinda awaited because Its just op and offers Fake Out.And Landorous is after Mega Kangama just the second best pokemon in the vgc allowed list. Provides EQ excellent stats Intimidate and even a free item position.If an american would have won with the team lots of people would say how good this team is. Seriously respect that Japan was just good. I actually prefer seeing someone winning with such good predictions instead of someone winning on timer.How does a variety help on winning. Im kinda disappointed seeing no multiple mega teams in the top . You may loose a type but you win a helpful ability or type exactly when you need it.

There needs to be a reasonable time between the release of a game and the VGC rules coming into play so people can adapt to the format.Not to mention US VGC circuit already has Fall Regionals which runs on the Worlds format every year they dont need the Winter ones to do the same thing because thats half a year of players getting easy points to Worlds purely off a game that theyve played for well over a year already.,pokemon,cugrkag,-1,t5_2qmeb

4948651,0,t3_3ional, First youll need a couple pokemon Most important are Dittosyoull need a few if you can manage it with at least  perfect IVs and all the best natures. Best place to get them is on XY Friend Safari make sure to find someone that has a Ditto. All pokemon caught in the Friend Safaris are guaranteed to have at least  perfect IVs theres rare occasions theyll have  or even  perfect IVs.Next a Pokemon with Flame Body you can find Pokemon with the ability here With that Pokemon in your party itll cut the amount of steps required to hatch the eggs in half. Next youll need some items Everstone give this to one of your Pokemon in the Daycare and itll pass on its nature to all offsprings guaranteed. Perfect if the parent has the right nature you want.Destiny Knot new mechanic in Gen . When one of your Pokemon is holding this wonderful item it will pick  IVs from both parentsNot in total but  out of the  possible IVs. I highly suggest using this verses the power items unless you want to start off with specific IVs first. Because of this new mechanic breeding is a whole lot easier and actually getting Pokemon with  perfect IVs is ridiculously easy. Even  IVs is possible I was an average breeder and I managed to get  Pokemon with  perfect IVs without hardly trying. IV Judge this guy is your best friend. This is the quickest way to figure out if your Pokemonoffspring have perfect IVs. If he says simply cant be beat! after a stat than youll know its  which is perfect. Location in XY hes the Ace trainer in Kiloude City Pokemon Center and in ORAS hes the Ace trainer in Battle Resort Pokemon Center.Im gonna start getting back into breeding something that is great to do is keep males with at least  perfect IVs. This will make future breeding easier on yourself. The female determines what the offspring will be so having a male with at least  perfect IVs adding Destiny Knot will make breeding  perfect IVs easier as well able to breed with any female in the same egg group.,pokemon,cuibg5d,1,t5_2qmeb

5003399,0,t3_3jcm8l,ORAS has the better metagame if you want to play competitively on cart. ORAS rating battles only allow pokemon who were caught or hatched in XY or ORAS meaning you wont be at a disadvantage because you dont have that one pokemon with that one move that can only be obtained from Pokemon XD or some other nonsense like that. However if youre into nonsense like that XYs online rating battles actually do allow you to use pokemon that were imported from previous generations. Nugget Bridge is great if you wanna learn the ORAS battle spot meta it has the exact same ruleset as VGC . Smogons forums are also pretty alright for learning about the Battle Spot Singles metagame. Checking Smogons main site for learning about things like EVs IVs and other hidden game mechanics would be very helpful. Alex Oglozas youtube channel is a great place to watch high level battles played out. He is often up in the s for rating battles and has finished a season in the s before which placed him at th in the world for that season. He likes to think out loud in his videos which can be great in providing insight as to how to think as a competitive battler.Hope this is useful!,pokemon,cup3i86,0,t5_2qmeb

If it had such ability it would win almost any game.Look at it this way HP stat remains that means base  and we need to add extra  points somewhere... if any of those would go to defense or special defense that are at  and  respectively it would make it almost impossible to OHKO. You could argue that what about they detracted points from defenses and gave them to offensive stats with attack at  sp. attack at  and speed at ... even if you made its defenses only like  or  it would have HUGE attacking power andor speed... there would be no playing around this. Another thing lightning rod motor drive volt absorb and sap sipper are abilities that would basically render you opponent without ANY way to knock you out.Magic guard well it could work but you are loosing the ability to hold life orb so it aint as snazzy.I still think that magic bounce wold be the perfect ability if not a completely new one for mega milotic.,pokemon,cv4nrku,3,t5_2qmeb

For your first playthrough he will be frustratingly hard to raise as he doesnt learn any good attacking moves by leveling up and barely knows any by tm. Youve Bulbasaur any way so yourre good.If you cant trade to another game dont bother with geodude either. No use training geodude up if you cant fully evolve him.Also dont evolve pikachu with the thunderstone at least until he learns thunderbolt. It wont learn any more moves by leveling up after it evolves into raichu and thunderbolt is its best attack.,pokemon,cv73u99,2,t5_2qmeb

They go over a cliff the bike Ash totally didnt take from Misty gets broken and Ash and Pikachu get thrown off of it. Ash urges Pikachu to get inside its ball for its safety knowing it doesnt like being in there. Ash then challenges the Spearows risking his own life for Pikachus safety. Then as Ash is about to die Pikachu gets up and manages to muster enough electricity to defeat the flock.I refused to watch that episode from  to  because the ending of it made me so sad.

Another recognizable popular character through which journey and series could be associated. Helped in keeping continuity stronger due to his history with Ash and ties to past generations. Delivering lot of humor fun interactions and awkward amusing moments with his peculiar personality.Stability and order in main cast with his wisdom and maturity. Took care of Ash and co cooked navigated way to any location they needed to go. While allowing us to learn more about nhis skills as breeder caught several amazing pokemoni always liked his Croagunk Ludicolo or Sudowoodo. Getting some kind of character development over timesmall  but still development.That was his role and he did very good job at it remaining memorable in many people hearts.Also i have no idea what your talking about. But Brock was handled bad and truly shafted only in Sinnoh. In Kanto Johto and HoennBattle Frontierwhich was step up from his treatment in Johto he functioned fine having importance and place in main castWay i see it you expected from third wheel character and male companion whose main value was in delivering entertainment and humor to be more than writers perceived him to be. To battle frequentlydespite being stated from day one he isnt interested in it  having huge story arcs where he enters tournamentsagain breeders or doctors dont do that  go through big emotional changes and breakdownswhich is in Pokemon only reserved for girls and occasionally Ash at times.

And I dont see how you can assume that one of those just isnt an HM slave or he has his HMs spread out. Honestly I think it is rather unreasonable to assume that hes clearly not asking for competitive help. And although yes any team can be for in game I would say most people who are actually casual dont just use any team they still try to make the best team they can. And I really really dont think you can say kabutops or kingler are simply better than poliwrath. Each of them has their own strengths and weaknesses relative to each other. And I meant in you comparing them to something like azumerill which is a higher tier. You could have named other higher tier water pokemon like rotomw empoleon swampert tentacruel etc. And lol EV training isnt hard in gen ? xD Its only faster in th gen because of horde battles.

I go ascending level so those lower will grow  before . I then go fractions of evolutions a Herdier  before Kricketune . But Stoutland  after Kricketune . I know whole fractions are equivalent but generally threestages are more powerful than twostages and therefore my twostager needs the exp. If theyre the same level and fraction then I go by total level or lack of usable moves. Who basically needs leveled more desperately is put first.

5333579,0,t1_cvrk8jc,Overheat and Leaf Storm effectively halve the power of all subsequent moves used by endspectrum attackers. Brutal Force causes any offensive move to have half power not just physical or special ones but in return the drawback only lasts for one turn. I feel Brutal Force creates another move template that can be followed and isnt a move that should just follow an existing move template.The proposed change for Discolor makes it so that there is absolutely no prediction involved in having its effect realized in battle. While both your and my versions work the best when the move is used on the same turn that the opponent uses a super effective attack mine has an added consequence that happens if a nonsuper effective move is used which makes strategy involved with the move more important.I think the workarounds your opponent can do to counteract Invariance that you mention are part of the strategy of using Invariance. Its one of those seemsgreatatfirstglance moves but upon closer inspection it doesnt seem that way. I like some of my mechanics to be that way.Ill admit that Deafening Scream isnt too useful past the first usage but if you can force a switch I could see it being pretty good.

Then over time the air would deflate and you could scrunch the extra fabric back into a small compact shape. Mind you this would require some kind of air can to be in the object and unless youre popping maybe a cheap massively replaceable CO can every time you do it this isnt a plausible idea to the common folk.

5400571,0,t3_3ozyzw,Theres always going to be a doubleedged sword obviously but I guess Id learn towards the give the Pokemon regular evolutions camp.As for the whole doubleedged sword issue this is one of the complaints with Gen  never forget  Many people complained that the Sinnoh Pokedex was very weak due to no small part that the Expanded Pokedex of the region  was comprised of nothing but Pokemon from past generations that included a new evoltion such as Glaceon and Leafon to Togekiss to Magnezone and everything in between and even many of the core Sinnoh Pokedex  was full of Pokemon that were new evolutions for old lines such as Roserade and Ambipom.All in all Gen  introduced  new Evolutions and  new Baby Pokemon leaving only  newnew Pokemon.Humorously Generation  is often frowned upon for not introducing many new Pokemon itself introducing only  new Pokemon and  mega evolutions making its total of  far exceed gen s total of .So all in all its damned if you do damned if you dont kind of deal.  Hahaha.That said I would still prefer them to give evolutions first.  Theres no reason something like a Mawile with its BST of  should be getting a Mega before a real evolution.  I mean shoot a CHARMELEON has a higher BST than Mawile.That said there is one grace for Megas it prevents power creep in the meta.  Now before you cock your head to the side and call me insane consider the following we either have mega evolution with only  mega per team or we replace all megas with normal evolutions meaning we can have all  of them on a team.  Suddenly that one gimmicky strong pokemon you use as an ace in the hole becomes  ridiculously strong Pokemon that become the baseline for the metagame.  The game would be nuts.So...yeah.  Ive gotten a bit rambley here.  Lemmie sum it up haha. Give proper evolutions to  stage or  stage Pokemon with low Base Stat Totals.  Theres no reason for Mawile or in the future say Jynx to have megas before true and proper evolutions. Megas are important too for keeping the metagame from going out of control.  If Pokemon stronger than Garchomp or Lucario or Blaziken became the norm instead of a one per team ace in the hole the game would be liable to fall apart. We cant chastise future games for not having enough new pokemon.  They have to dedicate time and energy to fixing mistakes of the past and a LOT of those mistakes are Pokemon without evolutions.  People endlessly herald gen  as teh best evar but until gen  took a bullet for the team imo gen  had a god awful Pokedex because of the sheer number of Pokemon like Sneasel and Gligar and Yanma  weak bad single stage Pokemon that didnt evolve....this post is a mess.  Sorry about that.,pokemon,cw1ze3m,15,t5_2qmeb

You get prompted to renew when you sign into the Bank but to sign in you need a copy of one of those  games in your system.If you find your copy of Y you can give it a shot.

5561231,0,t3_3r8nnm,Unfezant Pidove would be the most realistic choice for my starter. Its super common in NA and Ive always been entranced by their beautiful calls. My brothers caught her and gave her to me as a gift being that I was too young to do so myself. Although Pidove may not be intelligent she helped me get through social anxieties due to Pidoves fearlessness of humans. And later as a Tranquill then Unfezant she only improved upon that. She is very protective and attentive and as such hates being in her pokeball.Lopunny I got a buneary from the times my family visited Canada when I was super young. Id fed the flocks of buneary living there and eventually befriended one who wanted to stay with me. Of course I complied. Due to her fur being fluffier than most bunnypokemon her temperature has to be regulated by shearing certain amounts off much like a sheep. Instead of throwing it away my mother and I use it as yarn to crochet and knit scarves and hats as christmas gifts. It provides a lot of warmth in the cold months and Buneary is happy in the warmer months. Buneary quickly evolved into Lopunny due to our high friendship. As a lopunny there is more than enough fur to shear every winter so I sell the extra to help pay for my education and basic needs expenses.Sliggoo Goodra eventually? As a child I played in the mud and rain a lot. It wasnt uncommon for me to come across a Goomy hidden under the leaves. Being young I didnt fully realize how rare they actually were until I overheard my brothers talking about it. I went out on my own to try to catch a Goomy for each of them. In the end I got frustrated because at the time I wasnt very knowledgable on pokemon battles and couldnt manage to catch a Goomy. My brothers ended up finding out about my plan and we caught one for each of us by working together. Their Goomys evolved quicker than mine did. In fact my Goomy didnt end up evolving into a Sligoo until late in my grade school years and has yet to fully evolve into a Goodra but were really not in a rush.Crobat On an overnight trip my scout troop was scheduled to visit some caves in order to earn a patch. I wasnt initially excited until I caught word that it was the home of millions of batpokemon. Though it wasnt exactly smiled upon to catch or battle the pokemon within the cave there wasnt a rule stating that you couldntneedless to say I caught a cute little zubat and was detained from the other scout activities during the trip because I refused to release my new friend. Despite the subject of me getting in trouble for catching a weak pokemon becoming a joke in the family she eventually evolved into a strong and reliable crobat.Pelipper Wingulls are plentiful being that I live on the east coast. The little bugger tried to eat my french fries one day when I visited the shore with a friend. I managed to catch him using Tranquill Lopunny Goomy and Golbat. Wingull was feisty and rough but eventually mellowed out upon evolving. He didnt however lose his playfulness and constantly tries to scoop me up into his beak. To this day he refuses to eat pokemon food and will only settle for eating  human food particularly french fries at the dining table.Smeargle during my later years of gradeeducation I formed a strong bond with my art teachers. They encouraged me to pursue an education in art and as a parting gift they had chipped in bought a Smeargle for me. It would be the newest pokemon on my team being that most of the others had been with me throughout my childhood. Hes still adapting to the family but shows promise in where he is going. He gets really ticked off when I procrastinate so I may have more to learn from him then he does from me.,pokemon,cwmf6o3,1,t5_2qmeb

I use the same name across all my games so even though the actual ID will be different at least theyll all say OT Evan xP,pokemon,cwx2a1n,1,t5_2qmeb

5665163,0,t3_3sjkdk,Beware rant aheadFor me it has to be the Explorers trio Sky if I had to pick one of those specifically.Ive played since Rescue Team. RT was amazing. I loved the plot even if looking back on it things just seemed to...happen. Suddenly meteor! for example I loved the music and still do and it was a great start to the series. Not much in the way of character development Team Meanies are pretty lame and just...uninteresting tbh but hey. I enjoyed it. A great introduction to the series and I still enjoy playing it.Then Explorers came out. Holy hell in a handbasket. This game. Was the best. The music was amazing the plot was almost epic the characters were well fleshed out memorable and even likeable! Even the postgame was amazing. So much to do and see and explore. And then Sky came out and made itself one of my favourite RPGs of all time. The small additions it gave to the series just absolutely nailed it. My only nitpicks are that held items arent taken out of the bag meaning they take up space and that the flashbacks can get seriously annoying. But those are pretty much my only issues with this game. Honestly. Even the not being able to evolve until after the poststory line wasnt too much of an issue for me and it made evolving feel like an even sweeter reward for my trials. When I heard Gates was being released I was head over heels. Maybe a little bit too hyped because I found Gates...lacking. Severely. It felt like a stepdown from Explorers in SO many ways. I recently replayed it and my GOD I never realised just how long the story dragged on for! So much talking! And I was so disappointed that it only really contained pokemon from gen . I get that it was based on the Unova dex and that Unova exclusively contained its own pokemon but they could have expanded the list to include a LOT more from the other dexes only  of them are not native to Unova. Not to mention the lack of and endgame and inevitable grind just to be able to recruit TWO legendaries is...appalling to be honest. Also the game just hands you some pretty powerful pokemon through the game. Do three missions and get a free Virizion. Espeon and Umbreon are also pretty decent. Emolga can be super handy as well. And then part way through hey free Hydreigon at least x your current level! HUZZAH! Compared to the other games that just felt a little bit cheap especially given how difficult it is to recruit legendaries and how huge a range their was.Speaking of the game handing you powerful pokemon overall the game was just...too easy. The prior games had banned orbs from being used against bosses and I used to find this unfair. The fact I got through EVERY SINGLE BOSS FIGHT in Gates taking NO damage just made me realise how boring it is to do that. There was no challenge at all. No skill no training no grinding just pop an Allprotect Orb and a FoeSeal orb for good measure and you can destroy teams in mere minutes. It made the game feel...cheap. Cheap and lazy. Oh and only being able to do missions for items to build paradise sucked. Majorly. Yes I know you have the other noticeboard but you can only take one pokemon with you unless you have friends who played. Well guess what? No one I knew had that game. So to restock reviver seeds I needed to do these stupidly hard missions over and over. At least I found a good use for Hydreigon I suppose...That being said. The story isnt bad. There just feels like a lot of unnecessary chatter. I love Paradise and that I can make my own perfect pokemall for missions. And the fact that the main bad guy is more of a presence than an actual pokemon? I thought that was insanely clever! In a way it shows how negativity can affect us and I could even go so far as to liken it in a way to depression obviously I understand depression is complicated and very personal. But having the BBEG as a sort of infliction created by the world rather than an evil pokemon? That was pretty awesome. The feeling of hopelessness I felt both times playing that ending was amazingly well done. I also really liked the other characters in this game from the Team and posttown. I think Gates did a great job with their characterisation much like Explorers did so that even background characters had something to them even if they were a bit generic. Reuseable TMs were a godsend and the fact they were cheapish and easy to come by made things a hell of a lot easier whne it came to giving my team a lot of variation. Also the move sharingupgrading was awesome and the shared exp made me so happy if I had to take a level  dunsparce to the Glacier Id have just given up tbh. I know earlier I moaned about the game being too easy and yes this contributed to that. Even so I was still finding some of the dungeons pretty annoying to get through even if my level was a little higher than the dungeon pokemon so it wasnt something that bothered me too much.As always the music is up to par. Definitely a strong point.The main thing that lets Gates down is the huge lack of anything past the plot other than get points evolve beat legends. That was such a huge let down especially when you look at what both Rescue Team and Explorers offered. Is it a bad game? No. Is it the worst of the three? Id say so. So overall Explorers Sky specifically is my favourite. It was challenging but fun. The story and characters were amazing. Replay value is up there. And the feels. THE FEELSNote all these games gave me the feels. I cried at all of them. But TimeDarknessSky was a whole new level,pokemon,cwzbhbg,1,t5_2qmeb
5668340,0,t1_cwzpafv,If youre playing ingame truthfully you wont need stataffecting moves theyre best for competitive play.However if you are able to use stataffecting moves youre able to do interesting things like sweep through gym leaders or take out a pokemon you wouldnt normally be able to otherwise. In my opinion any move that boosts your stat by  or  or more stats by  at the same time are good ones to have since youll waste less time buffing up. Choice bands specs and scarves are great items to use since theyll boost attack special attack and speed by  but lock you in a move.

5789057,0,t3_3uddol,In the games the most powerful Pokemon by base stat is between the two Mega Mewtwo and Mega Rayquaza. In general Pokemon lore it would be logical to think that Arceus being the creator of the universe and all is the most powerful Pokemon. However I am not sure about this. I think Mewtwo is the most powerful Pokemon.I often think that maybe Arceus is not the creator of the universe more the creator of the Pokemon world. In my mind this means that he didnt create humans. They evolved much as they did in the real world. If Arceus did create all Pokemon then surely he would make sure that he is the most powerful Pokemon? That would be a given. He doesnt want to be overruled.However if he didnt create humans then is it possible for humans themselves to create something even more powerful than him right? In the earlier generations everyone talked about scientists trying to createThe most powerful Pokemon when they created Mewtwo. Now they cant be living under THAT big a rock to not have at least heard of Arceus. And when they actually create Mewtwo they are sure he is the most powerful Pokemon.The only other manmade Pokemon is Genesect but lacking a Megaevolution means that Mewtwo should be much more powerful. I like this idea that Mewtwo is a being even more powerful than the Godlike entity. Which was why I was kinda annoyed when Mega Rayquaza came along...,pokemon,cxeoqsl,1,t5_2qmeb

5850168,0,t3_3vadvb,Im personally irked by the fact that you not only based the first three on Beasts but that it was so incredibly blatant.The theory that the Beasts are reincarnated Eeveelutions is entirely fanon... and also rather unlikely in my opinion as I believe it was stated that HoOh is the one that made them embody the lightning fire and rain after or as a byproduct of their revival suggesting they didnt already have the powers their whole lives. Besides why would there be such a bizarre coincidence  the only three Pokmon that died in the fire just happened to also embody the three powers that caused their deaths?Additionally the first three are based on the Beasts while the others arent which while understandable because there only were three Beasts is wildly inconsistent.Some of these are good designs but the Beast idea is a unconfirmed and in my personal opinion quite unlikely b unoriginal and c inconsistent with the many other Eeveelutions.

5921647,0,t3_3wfpr1,Its because Pokemon with the exception of Nidoran were genderless in Gen  and it kinda of just stuck. Also with some minor exceptions most Pokemon has very little or no difference at all in terms of appearance between genders. Finally leaving it as it can let the audience either make an assumption themselves and just simply not worry about the Pokemons gender at all. Heck even Ash doesnt know many of his Pokemons gender. There was one episode they did I believe in the BlackWhite series where he only learned it by seeing what Pokemon were affected by the move attract.,pokemon,cxvuy0q,21,t5_2qmeb

5951406,0,t1_cxz30kr,Hey thats awesome! Good to see there are some older fans here playing.I am in my s and just recently picked up a nDS XL and got back into playing. I always feel weird about admitting that I am a  year old Pokemon fan.  Obviously the games were after my time as a kid BUT where I got into it was my son IS the Pokemon generation so I spent so many fun afternoons sitting on the couch watching him play on Gameboy or him watching me play which I think he enjoyed as much as playing himself. So for me it doesnt matter how old I am playing Pokemon while also addictive just for the game itself it also brings me back to some of the most fond memories I have or ever will have.So yes I am a  year old and I admit I love Pokemon. ,pokemon,cxzrcg6,1,t5_2qmeb

5972539,0,t1_cy2c9hf,I like that you realized theyd probably fight in their best areas. I think in the water arena youd have to also consider Walrein and the combination of Walrein and Lapras against Ludicolo would mean Ludicolo wouldnt win out. I think Lapras would survive here since it is the most versatile. I think youd have to consider Charizard in the flying arena  wouldnt make much sense for it to fight with a bunch of ground or rock types. I think Charizard may be able to put up a good fight against a Dragonite so for me its a coin toss between the two if Aerodactyl fought there Charizard would sustain heavy damage which could let Dragonite take it here. Claydol is a great Pokemon but Flygon Garchomp and Torterra all have strong moves to take it out. Id put my money on Garchomp or Torterra. Mamoswine is pretty bad ass and hits hard plus it is in a weak group. I dont think the Ghosts would be dumb enough to corner themselves with a bunch of Dark types so they might just be in their own group... maybe a haunted house? lol. Id expect Gengar to come out on top there. With only Dark types Id go with Pangoro or Tyranitar. There are plenty of other Darks that could wear down Tyranitar so Pangoro probably wins this one. I wouldnt count out good ol Venusaur against the Bugs. However I agree that Gallade is just too good to lose here. As far as the prairie goes Snorlax is such a great tank and Electivire is weak to earthquake Id give it to Snorlax especially because the fighting types stayed in the forest.

5975877,0,t1_cy2u6v5,I used to have this as a kid! I cant remember where Ive put it now though...Basically its a very dumbed down version of a Gen  game where you pick one of the three Hoenn starters and go from there. You can only have  Pokemon in your team and rather than choosing attacks its a bit of slots machine kind of thing where you roll for a chance to attack  a typed attack of power level   or  or a miss. I cant remember too much about the single player I think its just wild pokemon Gym Leaders and E that you can fight. After the E you can search wild Pokemon to find the Regi Trio an Rayquaza. Theres a maximum level of  IIRC. The best part about it was the multiplayer  youd connect it with a friends ultra ball via the connectors on the left hand side and it would automatically play out a battle that you can watch in your own time. I used to battle my friends all the time it was great. Feel free to AMA Ill see if I cant remember more about it.,pokemon,cy2yw0i,3,t5_2qmeb

6092251,0,t1_cyi3twm, EV training is making sure you are maximizing a pokemons stats by making sure that they get the correct number of EVs in the right stats. Gaining Evs in normal battles creates a random distribution of evs. For example my starter pokemon Swampert will have each of its stats boosted by about the same but my ev trained Swampert would maximize Health and Physical Attack. Ev training is most common at level  because the pokemon is usually just hatched so it doesnt have any Evs in the wrong places and you just breed the pokemon with egg moves or something. Any pokemon at any level can EV train just use EV reducing berries to reset.In your example the most competitive thing to do is to breed the skarmory because you have control over the natures. EVs are trained not genetically inherited you might be thinking of IVs a similar but completely different thing that modifies stats. Yes I know it is overwhelming..No Ev training doesnt counternegate natures. They both a boosts that stack with another and you want the best advantage possible competitively.NOTE DO NOT WORRY ABOUT EVS DURING THE STORY MODE it is a competitive thing and a competitivebattle maison thing only. The effect is negligible in the story mode but is critical in competitive battlesThe super training thing in ORAS is an alternate way to EV train but some people like me find it to be the slower method.This is really complex at first and can be overwhelming and frankly the game is really bad at explaining these concepts. Over time you will get more comfortable with this stuff. I really like this video explanation to start out with it was written for XY but it still works for ORAS she also covers other topics too like breeding and competitive battles in general.  AGAIN dont worry about this for the story mode!!! Hope this helps amp happy new year!!,pokemon,cyi4jl9,4,t5_2qmeb

Not everybody wants to take the time to do that and forcing those of us who dont want to ride around with an egg wasting precious moments of our lives shouldnt be forced to take whatever type flying or fighting the random number gen gave us.

6252203,0,t3_417i0a, More customization would definitely be a good thing but more of the outfits should be available early on and more consistently not based on day of the week as they have no gameplay benefit so theres no loss in giving us a lot of options early if anything it would increase immersion. Not too sure about more Megas it should be kept in moderation and only really welldesigned ones for Pokmon that can really use them. Who the fuck asked for Mega Audino? Esp when we sill have no Mega Flygon. Other candidates include PseudoLegendaries and Farfetchd because DUX. These battles would be incredibly gimmicky and youd have approximately  throughout the course of the game because it doesnt make any sense for some random Trainer who challenges you to own a Key Stone and half a dozen Mega Stones. Plus if you fight those youd be forced to bring a whole lot of your own Megas which doesnt necessarily make for fun team building because some are just obnoxiously OP if you fight them without Megas. MKanga MMawile Perish Trap MGengar MLucario MBlaziken MSalamance. Gg. Totally agree. BW had some sort of Challenge Mode but to this day I havent figured out how to turn it on and all it does is give everyone  levels plus and sometimes add another Pokmon. But even that is not difficult as much as slightly harder for weaker players. As a veteran Trainer of  years I want a hard mode to be really noobcrushingly hard I feel like almost all difficulty is gone from any video game nowadays. Leaders should have  Pokmon by the rd Gym all Admins Team Bosses Rival and E have full teams from that point on. Their Pokmon have actual EV spreads instead of all  if onlevel Absol outspeeds a Jumpluff that has it beat by  Base Speed that thing had no EVs nor IVs which is pathetic for a Gym Leader battle. And even regular Trainers bring  Pokmon with the occasional Ace Trainer or so having full . At least boss battles need to have some sort of set on their Pokmon that follows more or less competitive strategies Focus Sash on a frail setup Sweeper Leftovers Sheer Force Life Orb Lefties Eviolite Chioce items or even gimmicks like Flying Gem Acrobatics Unburden Sitrus Berry etc. And AIs that know how to utilize them and fight smart instead of using Foresight the third time in  turns. Basically bring the opponents from the Battle ChateauFrontierwhatever to the main story. The story had some great bits the FIreworks scene AZs story and some missed opportunities characterization for your Rivals and maybe even Team Flare and other NPCs Violas sister Alexa couldve played more of a role like she did in the anime. That was one thing BW actually did well giving Gym Leader and other NPCs several small appearances to flesh out their character more.

Its supposed to be the god of all pokemon granted thats not an easy thing to put into a design but it doesnt stand out all that much for me.Compared to its counterpart Giratina I think Arceus falls short. Giratina is classy and yet fierce and intimidating at the same time. It looks otherworldly but still somehow familiar. Its design combines many different fearsome creatures like certain reptiles and arthropods to create a wickedly awesome pokemon.Arceus on the other hand just looks like a mess. It looks like a llama to me. Which isnt an aweinspiring animal by any means it doesnt have much elegance or grace to its figure and it lacks any real presence. Honestly I feel a pokemon like Reshiram would be better suited to its role maybe change the sorta awkward wing hands and pinecone tail.,pokemon,czaz1uo,4,t5_2qmeb

6460167,0,t3_4456ri,You ought to be able to play ORAS or XY with no issue. All of the new features are explained well enough and if you have specific questions this sub is a great place to ask for help. There have been quite a few changes since DPP. Pokemon Amie lets you play with your Pokemon which increases affection. At higher levels of affection you gain quite a few benefits in battle which Im starting to realize on my latest ORAS run are actually quite useful. Super training is pretty annoying after a while but the end result is nice. It provides a much easier way to customize the EVs your Pokemon gains so you can essentially customize the way your Pokemon will grow by way of stat changes. I dislike the mini games but love the end result. The global trading system GTS and wonder trade are awesome. The GTS makes it incredibly easy to search and find desired Pokemon for trading and wonder trade can be fun. Fairy types were introduced. This is more of a big deal in XY than in ORAS given the Pokemon used by other trainers and the gym types of each region. Fairy types provide is nice way to deal with dragons without having a dragon of your own. And of course mega evolution. Its okay. Im not a fan of many of the designs theyre just a lot to take in sometimes but the concept is interesting. Not to mention that any Pokemon that mega evolves is a major boost in battle. ,pokemon,cznivya,1,t5_2qmeb

6605252,0,t1_d02hper,Mainly because Shuckle dies to anything once this gets set up. It switches his attack and defense meaning that he becomes an ultimate glass cannon with the highest attack Stat but one of the lowest defense stats in the game with a base of  which is tied with Blissey for the lowest base defense stat of any fully evolved Pokmon in the game. And he doesnt have Blisseys HP to redeem this he only has  base HP. He also doesnt have the speed to be able to hit most threats before they hit him  base speed so pretty much anything will be able to hit him before he hits them.If the opponent manages to let this get set up Shuckle might get one kill. Maybe. Hes really not a threat. Its just one of those gimmicks that seems unbeatabletoo powerful until you learn how easy it is to counter with really any team.,pokemon,d02jdpt,9,t5_2qmeb

But they could easily appease another large portion of their consumers by adding difficulty options back. Also i completely disagree with the rivals in X and Y having no personality. Sure i wish they could have spent more time fleshing each one out but I feel like the little time we had with them did a good job.

6659811,0,t3_46v7nl,Id say people think into this a little too much. Gen  is a much older game with an art style that was less refined. Not to mention people always look back at there childhood with rose tinted specs. I grew up with gen  just as a lot of you did. One of my favorite Pokemon is from gen  and I say that gen  has a LOT of horrible designs. And as games goes its probably the least fun.Designs are certainly getting better but not because they are better than previous ones but because theyre more imaginative. I mean... Gengar or Aegislash? Id take Aegislash any day. While Gengar might be cool and the idea is sweet... its just a walking shadow. Aegislash is a possessed sword and shield that if you ever touch it it would cling on to you and possess you. Thats creepy as fuck.I personally never did like gen  much. I hated a lot of their designs tbh. I also find it funny that gen  would rank higher than gen one here seeing as how a lot of the gen  Pokemon were designed at the same time as all of gen . A lot of them were even supposed to be part of the first generation and the first game.,pokemon,d086jvq,3,t5_2qmeb

6688636,0,t1_d0b5fiu,So for online competitions there are official ones by nintendo. Sometimes they will be online ones where anyone can join and there will be specific rules. Like in celebration of the rerelease of the original RBY games on the DS they are hosting a tournament where you only use pokemon from gen . Like the first  pokemon. There is also VGC which is the official physical tournament. However a lot of players dont like VGC because there is no balance and it only happens once a year and a lot of players cant travel to physical locations. There is also the unofficial competitive format which is smogon tiers. Smogon is THE competitive pokemon battling website. And a lot of players only play smogon tiers and dont worry about nintendos offical format. In fact more people play smogon tiers than VGC. www.smogon.comAs for which stats to focus on it essentially depends on the pokemonstrategy. If you want to be really advanced there are EV spreads which specifically target specific speed stats or specific pokemon but thats certainly a long ways off. A lot of competitive players dont even have a proper grasp on this. However if youre new and are not sure what EVs for which pokemon smogon is a great resource on explaining some great EV spreads. And yeah EV training doesnt matter for just in game teamsplaying at all. It ONLY matters if youre playing real players in a competitive environment and you need to make your pokemon as strong as possible. ,pokemon,d0b5wc2,2,t5_2qmeb

6722073,0,t1_d0elq1p,I think the best way that would make games more challenging instead of more arduous would be better team comps.

So far its been iconic to the series but if we also were able to cross outside of routes that would be great. Instead of having it be by routespoints of interesttowns I feel we should have it more aligned with the ingame distances.  I feel it should be more something along the lines of size class where X  speed  mileage  to  kg X  . . to   kg X  . . to  kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X   . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X   . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X  . . kg to . kg X   . kg to . kg X   . kg to . kg X   Taken from Bulbaped size class.

6737163,0,t3_47xooy,Well this thread came at the perfect moment!  Story timeNot my first but one of my earliest was a shiny Sneasel in Platinum.  The garish pink and yellow color jumped out at night and I caught her in a Dusk Ball.  I evolved her but never really used her.  She was a trophy.Flash forward to after I had beaten White and decided to work on a living dex.  I had almost everything but needed a Victini and very little that was worth anything.  I figured my shiny Weaville might be worth it so I put her up on the GTS or whatever gen s GTS was called.  Someone accepted and I got my Victini.  It felt hollow though.  I had the Victini but one of my only legitimate shinies was gone.  I hoped whoever got her appreciated her and promptly forgot about her.Recently Ive been migrated a ton of pokemon from HGSS in the special bank balls.  Among those I had put all available Dark and Ghost type females into Moon Balls including a Sneasel.  Im going to breed them for gen  females in the same balls and then release the mothers and any males onto the Wonder Trade.I rotate the fathers around from my legacy teams gotta share the love right? and for all the Flying and Ice types Ive been using my Delibird from Orre.  When Moon Ball Sneasels turn came up this morning my mind briefly went back to my longlost shiny Weaville.I had  eggs with me and had to be in at work in  minutes.  Hatching OPower burns  minutes.  So I began riding back and forth on Kalos Route  thinking Wouldnt it be awesome if Oswald the Delibird fathered a shiny Sneasel to replace the one I lost?Boom!  First.  Effing.  Egg.  Shiny female Sneasel!I saved  times because I couldnt believe it and went to work stoked.  Both parents are American so this wasnt the product of the Masuda Method.  The odds were certainly stacked against it.I nicknamed her Platina after my first shiny Sneasel encounter the original had no nickname and Im not going to make the same mistake twice.  Shell be with me forever.,pokemon,d0g6ixa,7,t5_2qmeb

6738221,0,t3_47yr94,Well I remember when it was first being discussed a couple years back that the people at Gamefreak Nintendo? were slightly concerned about this game since the Pikachu isnt your standard happy cuddly animalistic Pikachu.  They were worried it would affect the image if Pikachu and Pokemon as a whole.But to me spinoffs are supposed to be alternate looks at the world of Pokemon compared to the main series.  And not all of them need to appeal to everyone.  I love Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and Pokemon Pinball at least RS never played the original.  But I find Pokemon Conquest and Pokemon Rumble repetitive and boring.Do I whine when a Rumble title comes out?  No!  I could argue that Rumble goes against the main point of the games since the toy Pokemon cannot grow better and thus instead of having a theme of growth and friendship there is a theme of only using the best of the best and throwing the weaklings you started with away.Does that make it a bad game?  Nope.  Its just a different take on Pokemon as a franchise than other games take.  Detective Pikachu is the same way.  Its different yes but that doesnt make it bad or wrong.,pokemon,d0gagkm,3,t5_2qmeb

6799670,0,t3_48s94l,The chance to flee in the Safari Zone is based on the Pokemons base speed.Rocks make the Pokemon easier to catch but more likely to flee.  Because the flee rate is already so high this is never worth it with one notable exception Chansey.  Because its slow as dirt you can afford to increase its chance of fleeing once or twice.Bait makes the Pokemon less likely to flee but harder to catch.  Again because the flee rate is so high this is completely worthless.  At best youll buy a couple of extra turns in which your safari ball misses.Tauros has enough speed that it will absolutely always flee on the first turn never try anything but a ball on it.,pokemon,d0n19y0,2,t5_2qmeb

DiamondPearl was kind of bland garbage but Platinum is pretty much one of the better games of the franchise for example.I too assume they will just build out Kalos in the next gen with a connected region and some more polish here and there.,pokemon,d0qp8zj,4,t5_2qmeb
6832331,0,t3_49bzkj,At this point I hope they continue the FireWaterGrass trio for as long as possible. If they wanted to mix things up they would have years ago. Its simple and helps new players get into the games mechanics. I cant think of any other type trio that is more basic and easy to understand than the current three. I never understood the push for FightingPsychicDark either. Not only would this be confusing as hell to new players why does Psychic beat Fighting? Why does Fighting beat Dark? but Dark is completely immune to Psychic making the trio unbalanced from the get go. ,pokemon,d0qqudp,3,t5_2qmeb

6914779,0,t1_d0zy0l1,yeah and considering pokemon hatch at level  You cant really tell their IVs. Theres a person who can ballpark for you but generally hell say This pokemon could be strongerWhen you get your pokemon to level  You can usually use a calculator to determine its IVs without ANY Evs by  point error margin so a stat could be  or  because a pokemon with either IV count would have the same stat. Only at  do you get a perfect reading.Basically Every pokemon has a base stat. I like Dragalge. lets use it as an example. A Dragalge with  HP IVs at level  will have the HP of . No ifs ands or buts.Now if this level  Dragalge had  IVs in HP his HP would be . and at  IVs it would be  and so onBy Breeding pokemon with strong IVs together in specific stats you have a much higher chance of the offspring have the same as or higher IV in a given stat. Simple yet mindnumbingly boring and long.Now A pokemon can ALSO gain EVs or effort values. They can only have a MAXIMUM of  EVs with a MAX  per stat so you have to use them wisely.Why the numbers  and ? well the first pokemon games were for gameboy and memory was premium so pokemon were given IVs from    values as a form of genes with  being the max storage capacity of unsigned bits. With Gen III they doubled that number to  values or  and changed EVs to use unsigned bits which store a total of   makes  total values  x    which they round to . Idk why.Now that computer math is out of the way A Pokemon can have  EVs...  max per stat. every  EVs gives the pokemon  stat point at level . So a Level  Dragalge with  HP EVs and  HP IVs would have  HP.  HP IVs would be  HP. make sense?So EVEN THOUGH a pokemon can have  EVs... you shouldnt try to max them out because  is not divisible by . so the Max EFFECTIVE EVs you can get out of a pokemon is  or  points at level . So a Dragalge with  HP Evs and  HP IVs would have  HP. A Dragalge with  HP EVs and  HP IVs would have  HP. This is the absolute Maximum HP of the pokemon.So lets look at a sweep Dragalge build. Hes got powerful SpAtk moves and his base SpAtk  is higher than his Atk  so it makes sense to not make him a physical attacker. Now if we want him to sweep we know what attack to focus on but he needs to be fast too. His SLOW base speed  makes him not ideal for this but well work on his speed anyways so he can try to sweep. So what youre looking at here is making sure his IVs are maxed and maxing his EVs in speed and SpAtk|Draglage|  IVs |  IVs |  EVs|||||||HP         |     ||        ||Atk         |     ||        ||Def         |     ||       ||SpAtk     |     ||  ||SpDef     |     ||      ||Speed    |        || |Then of course there are natures to further enhance stats where one stat will be multiplied by . and another by .. There are also natures that do not enhance stats at all so it also does not detriment one.Edit Fixed some issues with Max EVs and stat calculations factoring out detrimental natures.,pokemon,d1042hg,2,t5_2qmeb

The issue is not that the XP Share makes overlevelling easier the issue is that overlevelling gives you an advantage in the first place. Id like to see that official ingame battles gym e champ... have a more competetive ruleset Pokemon are fully healed before the battle but no trainer items potions xstat ... are allowed during battle Pokemon levels are capped to the opponents highest level The number of pokemon is limited. The first gym leaders dont have a full party but you cant use more pokemon either. no free switchesWith these changes you can use the XP share to reduce the grinding time for example for new pokemon in your team while maintaining the difficulty of the key battles in the game. XP Grinding can give an advantage in the early game earlier access to powerful moves and evolutions but this advantage would become smaller as the player progresses through the game.,pokemon,d12f6mn,3,t5_2qmeb

It had a diverse range of pokemon thatcould be found in locations befitting them. The game is challenging and reasonable as well as having an excellent postgame for many different styles of playing exploringtrainingcatch them all. The characters were very interactive and had their own story and life  I dont think any other gym leaders took as much action as the Unova leaders and they had their own hobbies too  heck the rivals had strong story arcs and actually grew towards the end Hugh realising that people do change and Biance facing the truth that she isnt a good trainer but finds a dream and a life that is more fulfilling.

6984122,0,t3_4b9z98,What I think Nintendo will do what gamestoper and klonoahedgehog said.What I hope they do NPCs. Theres enough of them to have some sort of line that at least someone likes but not so much that we end up with a  pkmn situation. You could train up a team like in SSBDSWiiU where the data is stored in the amiibo. Their teams could be different based on certain criteria such as which version of the game you have which starter pokemon you picked etc  stock  pokemon. And they grow with you so if you defeat x gyms then they have lv.y pokemon and z number of them. This could integrate into the Secret Base thing or have neat points like Ace Trainer helps EV train or Pokemon Breeder boosts breeder capability etc. Itd also be neat to import other main characters from other series like N changes pokemon every time or Red level grows everytime you beat him and hard hard hard AI.At this point Im just excited so better stop haha.,pokemon,d17zn8x,1,t5_2qmeb

Persian was okay but didnt really cut it.So when Luxray was released I immediately caught a cute little shinx and made it a part of my party.Pros amazing design luxray looks absolutely awesome. Fierce and cool loaded with little details that add character but dont make him look over designed. The shiny is a pretty good shiny too. typing electric type is awesome. I know some people say he should have been dark type too but Im not in that camp. I dislike the idea of it having more type weaknesses. movepool its not super diverse but its not barren and breeding gives a lot of decent options plus its attackig stats make it really flexible in which moves you want to run which is awesome for regular playthroughs ability intimidate isan awesome ability flavor wise and in practicality which is great because rivalry sucks.Cons speed didnt find out till I got into competitive pokemon for a bit but its speed is uncharacteristically abysmal. Why would a cat move that slow? It makes no sense.Really hoping luxray gets a mega.

7020553,0,t1_d1c2zwf,Just because you play games doesnt mean you know how to make them. Im going to school for it right now and Ive become sympathetic towards game developers but I also recognize when a game developer misses an opportunity or just messes up in general. I can honestly say that I feel confident in what Pokemon Go will be and while the game will be different than a main series game Im still as excited for it as when the trailer first came out. I also feel that parts of the community are being hypocritical towards Go they say that they want Pokemon to change but when the company decides to change the format on a system that is aimed towards everyone the community freaks out because we cant grasp that pokemon isnt even for older people its for the younger kids. The ones with short attention spans the ones that have a smartphone at age  the ones that look at Pokemon and say Mommy! Daddy! ItsPikachuandIwantitsobadly! That is the target audience and the parents of said audience is where most of the money comes from.Look at rpokemons subscribers  and the sales of Pokemon XandY as of Dec.    copies sold rpokemon would have had to buy almost  games per person to make up such a significant amount of sales that GF would listen to our voices without us trying. To put that another way rpokemon assuming we buy one game per person makes up about  of the total XY sales. Thats also assuming that there are no double accounts here and that the bots also bought a game.So next time you criticize a video game company on making a decision you dont like ask yourself What have I done to make them listen to me? If you sent them a letter and got a response back then thats one thing but if you think that buying a game or playing s of hours playing it gives you some sort of right to sway how the game is made then you should take some game design classes to learn something.TLDR rpokemon gets very upset at minor things that the Pokemon company and Gamefreak do when we should be grateful that they even care to patch competitive play and realize that we are nowhere near significant enough as a population to sway game design. Its fine to vent frustration but we cant get out of hand and let our frustration become ignorance at why a decision was made.P.S. Lets just play the games and get hyped about what comes next like the awesome people we are.,pokemon,d1c4oxm,2,t5_2qmeb

7103206,0,t3_4ctctb, Ash doesnt exist  region per season Protagonist of each season is based off the game protagonists Pokemon sound like the way they do in Origins and the BW trailer instead of chanting their names more mature tone. I mean definitely not PG cause kids should still be allowed to watch it but more like PG? No lame cutesy stuff in the story at all Protagonists fully evolve all of their PokemonSeason  tells the story of Red Blue and Leaf traversing the Kanto region and defeating Team Rocket. At some point Red captures Mewtwo.Season  tells the story of Ethan Lyra and Silver traversing the Johto region and dealing with the return of Team Rocket. Maybe a spinoff season where Ethan goes to Kanto and eventually traverses Mt. Silver and fights Red. At some point Ethan captures Suicune or Hooh or Lugia.Season  tells the story of Brendan May and Wally as they traverse the Hoenn region and get caught in the middle of a conflict between Team Magma and Team Aqua. The story would be some Frankenstein mashup of what happens in Emerald Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. At some point Brendan captures Primal Groudon and May captures Primal Kyogre.Season  tells the story of Lucas Dawn and Barry as they traverse the Sinnoh region and deal with Team Galactics plans for world domination. At some point Lucas captures Giratina.Season a tells the story of HildaHilbert Bianca and Cheren as they traverse the Unova region and come into conflict with the mysterious trainer N as well as the villainous Team Plasma who wishes to liberate Pokemon. Due to the nature of the story its based on they would have to choose a color how about Pokemon Black just because Black is first. At some point Hilda captures Reshiram while N has Zekrom and there will be an epic fight.Season b tells the story of Nate Rosa and Hugh as they traverse the Unova region and come into conflict with a new faction of Team Plasma as well as the mysterious scientist Colress.Season  tells the story of Calem Serena Shauna Tierno and Trevor as they traverse the Kalos region and come into conflict with Team Flare but one major difference is that Shauna Tierno and Trevor are actually interesting characters unlike their game counterparts. At some point Calem captures Xerneas while Serena captures Yveltal and kills the entire cast by draining their life forcebut those are just the game stories Nah they can elaborate on the game stories and focus on the characters in such a way that the games cant.,pokemon,d1lirt6,7,t5_2qmeb

While theyre connected and are one landmass theyre considered two different regions.Hoenn is its own region and is completely surrounded by water.Sinnoh is also another region however its hinted that the Southern area of the region may be possibly connected to another region or even Kanto. Its only speculation nothing confirmed. Unova like Hoenn is separate from other landmasses and is its own region.Kalos is the once again its own region but it is unknown what region stands to its East.See the regions as countries and how every country has border.

Eventhough these abilities are really good imagine if they just doubled Azumarills attack to  base this gives it the same power but it would also have access to its other abilities sap sipper and thick fat making it strong there are also other benefits to this being an ability like interactions with Mummy or skill swap which allow the ability to have more creative outcomes then just doubling a pokemons attack.,pokemon,d1pbjxg,1,t5_2qmeb

7183296,0,t1_d1u130l,In Colosseum the Shadow Pokemon were originally created in the Cipher Lab in the middle of the desert.  Pokemon were stolen in Pyrite Town smuggled through the Under to the Shadow Liner and shipped to the lab by high speed rail.  Once in the lab they were kept in kennels.  You can see the kennels for yourself in the game.  Supposedly the shadowfication process involved some kind of chemical injections and physical conditioning... that is torturing.  All of this was lead under scientist Ein and he kept a number of logs about the process.In XD they had the valley girl genius Lovrina at their disposal.  Lovrina seemed to develop a much more rapid and automated way to shadowfy Pokemon from inside the Poke Ball as seen in the brand new Cipher Key Lair.  Her crown achievement XD was also shadowfied in such a way that it was impossible to purify it through conventional methods and could only be successfully purified using the efforts of toptier scientists and cutting edge technology.  Pokemon that were to be shadowfied in this way were all taken from the SS Libra that is stolen in the opening cutscene.  There is no way to know if the Pokemon aboard the Libra belonged to any trainers.,pokemon,d1uof0e,2,t5_2qmeb

7237171,0,t3_4eivw0,Okay heres an idea to ponder about.ampnbspIn Pokemon X and Y the legendaries were pretty bland in taste executionwise they were just...there. As opposed to BWBW DPPt and RSE their legendaries were pretty much a huge impact acting as plot devices. In XY... we dont even know where they really were found just that Team Flare already and conveniently caught them for us to inspect at their hideouts basement. Sure they had separate and opposing descriptions about their influence on the lore of Kalos one brings about death and the other brings life. But given the premise of X and that of Y compared to each other they were painfully interchangeable werent they? At least in RSE Groudon had Team Magma and the drought thing going on and Kyogre had Team Aqua and the torrential downpour. Xerneas and Yveltal were just pretty much there conveniently seen as a good enough energy source for Team Flare to utilize for an even bigger and an even more significant plot device that is the Ultimate Weapon.ampnbspMaybe just maybe Xerneas and Yveltal coming back for Gen  wouldnt be the worst thing IF they get a richer backstory and an even bigger involvement with SMs plot. Again in XY they were just there. And great they looked like the letters X and Y. But Im sure not only me agrees on the fact that their overall presence in the story is a bit lacking for Pokemon that are deemed the mascot legendaries.,pokemon,d20tbdz,4,t5_2qmeb

They wouldnt fit in Pokemons type scheme and would only fit a few Pokemon. Fairy worked so well because tons of existing Pokemon fit it. They didnt have to make a whole lot of new Pokemon for Fairy because there were so many ones that fit! These types at best have like  Pokemon fitting in them.

One reason why I didnt like gen  was because it was overload on the number of new Pokemon to the point where some Pokemon lost their shine and many were unoriginal ideas. Dragons were no longer the awesome Pokemon type just because there were so damn many of them now.For that I really liked gen  not too many new additions but more importantly they gave love to the older Pokemon some of whom really benefitted from having MegaEvolutions. Look at Kangaskan now... how far shes come. And the new additions we got were pretty cool too who knew Tyrantrum could be the king among fossil Pokemon?In that respect I wouldnt mind if gen  added regular evolutions to Pokemon that really need it. Dunsparce comes to mind. Though a MegaEvolution would be just as good.

It helped me fit this profile that my grade school friends were all Group Aers so I was able to get those grade school popularity points that way.  More recently Ive only been playing alone so its less of a factor but I think it really had an impact on my pokemonpurchasingpsyche.Edit I recommend you put together a poll to see if people actually conform to your theory.

7535335,0,t1_d2ypqbd,Good. You make some interesting points and Id hate for them to be drowned out by someone thinking that you were shouting them. Some of your ideas have some good roots to them and can spark conversation even though I dont particularly agree with the exact methods youd use to correct them. For example making shinies obviously better in terms of abilities to me is a nogo but Ive posted about that elsewhere in this thread. I do see the point you make about them seemingly being worthless or just trophy Pokemon so maybe something can change. Me Id make it so that when you get a shiny itll always have perfect IVs. Sure you wouldnt be able to get Shiny Jolteon with HP Ice but itd make most of the shiny Pokemon you get almost ready for battle with the right Nature and might make shiny hunting some Pokemon more meaningful. Sure a shiny with perfect IVs will be superior to most other members of its species but it wont be at an unattainable level that couldnt be reached by breeding and hard work.,pokemon,d2yqbi1,2,t5_2qmeb
7536296,0,t3_4iknqe,Assuming youre a VGC player.VGC meta is horrible from what I understand and just last years meta on steroids pretty much. Its why I took a break this year.PGroudon is perhaps the most powerful threat in VGC that said you can beat it.From what I understand all Rayquaza needs is Life Orb and Surf and it can deal with PGroudon easily you dont even need to Mega Evolve.  Other counters are LandoT if you can switch in on a Ground move but he doesnt want to take Sun boosted Fire moves at all. Sadly there isnt much that can be done against the weather trio theyre simply just so powerful it doesnt really matter. Kyorgre is probably the easiest to deal with since he still has  weaknesses at the end of the day and the Cloud Nine Pokemon are very weak Please dont use GolduckIf you really want to stop them Id pick up Rayquaza. I mean thats his job he puts Kyorgre and Groudon in line. as far as Xerneas goes Geomancy  Power Herb is why its so common. Most often I see them carry Moonblast Dazzling Gleam Protect and Geomancy.Youre best bet is to carry a Steel type such as Aegislash or Ferrothorn but watch out because theyre often paired with Groudon.Kyogre  Rayqauza  Aegislash  Ferrothorn can make for a good counter to Xerneas  Groudon so long as the weather is in your favor.hope this helps.Also if you choose Aegislash go for Physical since Geomancy boost Xerneas special defense but not its defense,pokemon,d2yu97i,6,t5_2qmeb

Every other game is a pair with the exact same story even Rayquaza is just tacked on to RS. If you count Crystal as just a slight change to GS that leaves Platinum as the only game aside from Yellow that was unique in its gameplay. ,pokemon,d2zmvfm,2,t5_2qmeb
7543918,0,t3_4imolu,I dont do competitive but I battled against a guy who did and it was a pretty close battle. It was a really fun battle too more so because I used the Pokemon I had caught and trained this was back in SS and they managed to beat a fully EV and IV trained team.Losing in a Pokemon battle against another player can be frustrating specially if theyre bad winners but in the end thats what the game is about Battling to win or lose. How you take it is what it matters just like pretty much everything else.However looking at the current metagame is that how they call it? players are using Pokemon that the pros use so they can have similar chances of winning and thats just ridiculous IMO. I know theres tiers and stuff but I think that losing a battle with a team you like is better than winning with Pokemon you dont like that much.Sorry for the rant lol.,pokemon,d2zpgap,1,t5_2qmeb

Why couldnt a specific sub have been set up for talk about the new game?  There is a lot o content that comes through rPokemon that has nothing to do with SUMO and some of us really honest to goodness feel that Nintendo divulges waaaay too much information prior to release since when is Nintendo the arbiter of what counts as the right amount of spoilage anyway?At any rate I do applaud the mods for getting on this quickly.

7638958,0,t1_d3afpvu,Well sure I can buy that the region uses entirely new mons. but they didnt have to be so heavyhanded about drawing these similarities. Like the Garbador and Gothitelle lines were better as new takes on old mons. They at least mixed up the style from waste sludge to waste trash or pureness mentality to darkness mentality. But these were just heart shaped fish to bigger heart shaped fish and bullbison to bullbison with an afro. And logically in theorized Pokemon cannon the Unova region is still connected to mainland. Why does Black and White only have new gen  mons? If anything Hoenn is a standalone island and it would appear that Alola region is a standalone island as well. They should be isolated with unique mons. BW did add all the rest however so I can appreciate that. But why were they separated in the first place.

I think its difficult having the motivation to basically play a slightly newer version of a game that you already finished.  Thats how I always felt especially since I probably invested  more hours on the older versions. Once I finished the main story of the rd version I jumped back to the older version to actually complete the side missionspokedex. Pokemon Yellow brought a whole new innovation of Pikachu following you like the anime when it was as popular as ever. And it rode on the tails of the Original RedBlueGreen yet it still had somewhat lack luster sales.  Plus Yellow actually brought color!

Its only advantage is that VGC is nintendos official format for their tournaments. And if you play smogon mega kangaskan is banned at least in standard OU. As for which pokemon are good units or viable would be a better word it depends on what tier you want to play. For smogon one of the great things about it is that it breaks up all the pokemon into different tiers so no matter what pokemon you want to use it is viable in some tier even pokemon like lickitung are popular in certain tiers like little cup.

7797848,0,t3_4m3kpx,Its almost as if people dont remember any of the Gen I rival battles. The only ones that slightly qualifies as this are on the SS Anne Silph and the Champion fight the first two have healing beds in the area you can go to at any time and the latter most you should have everyone healed up before hand any way. All other ones were just outside of towns and the first floor of Pokemon Tower. I see so act as if the Rivals were so much more of a beat down in the past games. The only ones that really are are Silver at the end of Victory Road which isnt really because it has no trainers and there is the lady who heals just a bit below the last trainer Wally in Ruby and SapphireORAS Barry if you go up too many steps before healing in the Pokemon League and Hugh just before the end of Victory Road the last healer is a distance away and I always end up forgetting about going back.

7800416,0,t1_d3sg7ch,Black and White introduced some insane power creep and the teams given to opponents seem to be a lot more savage than what I would usually expect from a Pokemon game.  Bullshit like Work Up in the first gym that always gets the type advantage on your starter even Elesas Emolga and their Volt Switch shenanigans Skyla and that OP as fuck Acrobatics... and dont even get me started on the BRUTAL spike in the level curve as soon as you get your eighth badge in hand.  The Elite Four themselves were bad enough at level  on everything then Ghetsis shows up out of freaking nowhere with something almost  levels above that and then suddenly all the NPCs in the postgame have Pokemon of that level too as well as the wild Pokemon...The balancing factor in this is that for every overpowered tool the opponents got you also had access to in terms of Pokemon to train and techniques to use.  Obvious legendaries and version exclusives aside there wasnt a Pokemon introduced in Gen V that you couldnt just get yourself before the story ended which for some stupid reason is a really common problem in the preceding games.  Pus the game offers you some freebie tools that you can choose to use or not use to modify your difficulty challenge.  First gym pulling out the type advantage on you?  Someone just so happens to be trading away a mon that can bring your advantage back.  Running behind on EXP?  Theres a Pokemon that can appear in almost any route that will dump buckets of it on you if you defeat it and it usually attempts to heal you instead of fight you when you find it at higher levels.  Also Professor Juniper hands you a Lucky Egg halfway into the game for free.  Stuff like this where the game points these tools out to you but doesnt force them upon you.  If you want a more challenging game just refuse the handouts.,pokemon,d3stszk,24,t5_2qmeb

A trainer doesnt just get handed  badges heshe has to work for them and considering that it took Ash  episdoes just go from badge  to  it isnt too farfestched that Sawyer was training overtime during that time. My issue is with Ash we actually see the majority of his journey so his jump in powerlevel is a bit more questionable. Plus Sawyers Sceptile actually put up a really good fight against Greninja during the episode Ash first fought Alain and only one after his Greninja went Ashgreninja. did it win.

After the Regional Dex is completed start with the national dex.Leave Legendarys to be last because exclusive ones can be a pain. If you really want to bank all the exclusives then restart and and use the doubles to trade for the other versions Legendarys.While working through your regional Pokedex organize them in your PC in numerical order so you can see your progress better than opening the Pokedex which i find to be terrible to navigate.,pokemon,d3xnj4y,2,t5_2qmeb

7948640,0,t3_4o24fc,For me pre and baby evolutions are just a waste of pokedex space. They really dont add anything except a weak cute design you see for maybe  levels since they probably evolve with happiness and why would you want one on your team? New evolutions are okay but they need to make sense or at least add something valuable to a Pokemon and weve never really seen much of that except for maybe the Porygons Magmortar and Electivire. Dusknoir just added shame to the Duskull family and Magnezone didnt solve the problems Magneton had. I think that with MegaEvolution the purpose of making a Pokemon relevant and useful is done in a way that makes sense adding more lore about the relationships of trainer and Pokemon and about evolutionary stones. That being said I know Im pretty biased considering two of my most favorite Pokemon have been Mawile and Sableye and I think I would have chosen MegaEvolution for them over normal evolution any day. Plus they keep their small compactsize while traveling which I love in Pokemon as for me carrying around a team of gigantic fearsome monsters gets kind of old.,pokemon,d49i34i,1,t5_2qmeb

7953571,0,t3_4o6ju1,They didnt remove character customization in ORAS. They were working on XY and ORAS concurrently with different teams working on each. I know it appears as though  ORAS was released a whole year after XY but it takes longer than a year to design these games. At the time of designing ORAS they didnt know character customization would have been as big of a hit as it was and they only thought to implement it to XY to fit with its theme of beauty. If they had known and if they had the time they might have implemented it into ORAS given that as soon as they were able to we can see that they have implemented it into SM.Once again they didnt so much as remove pokemon walking and post game so much as they just didnt implement it or as effectively if you didnt like Delta episode. The step up to d between gen V and VI was so much larger than the transition between any other gen. It wasnt as simple as bringing over sprites and maybe modifying them a bit and adding new pokemon like they had previously they had to recreate every pokemon once again and form d models from scratch. With that much time being spent on the development of core features being able to see your pokemon in d now it may be somewhat understandable if they had less time to implement additional features like post game which at least they tried to with Looker in XY and Delta episode. Not only that but consider the enormous amount of effort it might take to create along side these new d models completely different field models for pokemon walking. I think they did alright for gen VI and maybe some of these issues you have will be resolved with gen VII and beyond.,pokemon,d4a214d,2,t5_2qmeb

I went through Pearl without evolving it as a little challenge and Turtwig was level  before I finally evolved it to Torterra I did a lot of random battles in the post game. Now that its evolved its a great tank and is my goto battler for that team.The second is Greninja. My starter of choice for Y ever since I saw Froakie Greninja sort of reignited my love of Pokemon. Its big role in the anime got me back into watching it after nearly a decade of not really taking it seriously. Plus it is my best character in Smash Bros being the character I used to win some tournaments at my college. Its also the only Pokemon Ive raised two of in the same game with one being my starter in Y and another being a Protean Breedject my friend gave me I use the latter in WiFi battles all the time.Of course when I got Super Mystery Dungeon my team was Froakie me and Turtwig named Twiggy,pokemon,d4c2w93,2,t5_2qmeb

The two key moves that you need for maximum successhilarity are Agility Kingler has base  Defense its unlikely hell be OHKOd by a Physical attack and Crabhammer.  Heres a sample setKingler  Life Orb  Ability Sheer Force  EVs  Atk   SpD   Spe  Adamant Nature   Agility   Crabhammer   Knock Off   XScissorBasically any success story involves sweeping like four out of six Pokemon with him as my last Pokemon because of how fucking HARD he hits. People forget Kingler has base  Attack. In terms of XScissor really its just there for coverage. You could also run Body Slam or Rock Slide. All other boosting moves are unnecessary unless you have another way to speed Kingler up. You could also exchange Life Orb for Leftovers but really getting Agility off is basically a deathknell for any nonBrave Bird so he doesnt need to last that long in most cases.People underestimate Kingler which they really shouldnt do.

8102935,0,t3_4q380u,Ive been a Nintendo fan all my life but Ive never really played the Pokemon games before.  Im trying to catch up now.I just beat Fire Red for the first time over the last week or so and I was a little lukewarm about it.  I chose Charmander as my starter and the first two gyms were pretty difficult and I was having a lot of fun... but after that the game just got super easy.  I was just steamrolling all the trainers and not having too much fun doing it.  Misty challenged me much more than any other trainer in the whole game.  When I reached the elite four I felt somewhat challenged again but I still made it through in one go.  Also I felt really cheated in terms of the whole gotta catch em all thing.  There were probably  species that I could reasonably obtain in the game but I would have to buy other copies and trade through the archaic GBA link cable with others to catch the rest.  It wasnt like Mario  where you could reasonably get all  stars.  I just kind of gave up and accepted that my pokedex would never be complete and Im usually the type of guy who makes sure to complete everything in games.Dont get me wrong I thought the world was cool the writing was fun and some of the exploration was fun but the combat was just too easy for me.Basically I know that this series has a lot of diehard followers and I want to give it a fair shake.  Can you guys recommend a game in the series that you think will wow me?  I would love to play one thats more difficult or generally considered better.

Needless to say i was defeated the first time. Then later I decided to catch a Dark type to help me out for that annoying Zatu with Psychic and I found an Absol. After catching and training it I realized something this thing was a monster ! One SD up and Slash killed everything. So on the second match after much training it ended on a draw because both of our pokemon fainted due to Perish Song. And on the final battle Umbros its name corruption of the world Umbra and my Flygon Hannah brought the victory. And this was not the end.

I think I remember some anime episodes where Team Rocket wishes that Meowth could use the move to make money but I guess besides the fact that he cant learn any new attacks due to learning how to speak human language theyre also pretty broke and are hoping he could throw a little money to make more money at the end of battle or just sad that they dont have any money to throw to win more... ,pokemon,d4ruy49,1,t5_2qmeb
8112118,0,t3_4qcc6c,SPOILERS OF EPS   Were not  sure but theres a theory that its because in the recent episodes    Ash was acting quite selfishly while battling. He desperately wanted to beat Sawyer but ended up losing and he desperately tried to show off to Sawyer that he could easily beat Wulfric but ended up losing in both these cases Greninja was the one who took the blame on himself he believed that it was because he was not good enough for Ash while Ash was being selfish and thought that it was his own fault for not being strong enough and that Greninja hates him.In episode  theres scenes of both Ash and Greninja separately brooding over their mistakes in the middle of the snow but Serena was worried about Ash and went and told him that he isnt the same Ash that she looks up to which made him realize that he was an idiot for thinking so selfishly. In the end they end up synchronizing so the theory says that they finally got over it and returned back to being buddies.So in summary Ash dreams of Greninja turning his back because he thinks that Greninja doesnt like him anymore because he lost to Alain Sawyer and Wulfric when in actuality it was Greninja who was taking part of the blame as well but Ash didnt realize it but its all good now.,pokemon,d4rving,1,t5_2qmeb

Thats just my opinion though.With regards to Verlisify at least his cheating topic I believe he is correct. However he is going about this in the wrong way and hunting down cheaters. Most people believe that his beliefs against cheating are to get views on youtube and this is why he is incorrectly calling out many youtubers. If he truly believed that cheating was wrong and a good person he couldve potentially asked his fans to ask TCPi to create a method to get Pokemon that is not based on RNG.Just my  cents though.,pokemon,d4t65oj,3,t5_2qmeb

8161485,0,t1_d4xqae5,Im looking forward to seeing what improvements they do make. And by fanboy Im referring to being downvoted so heavily by people that think Pokemon can do no wrong. Look at the shit Assassins Creed and Call of Duty gets for selling you the same game every year.Ive expressed pretty much the same opinion on rgames with the opposite reaction.,pokemon,d4xqf2a,-2,t5_2qmeb

8162271,0,t3_4r2mfi,Tapu Koko definitely will be a staple in competitive battling especially double battles where Dark VoidSporeSleep Powder run rampant pretty much being the decisive factor if you win or loose which is why I dont like VGC with an ability like Tapu Kokos summoning Electric Terrain this will become far less common since for those that dont know Electric Terrain aside from granting a  extra boost to Electric type moves also prevents sleeping so really the sleep shenanigans will finally find there end and Im SO happy of this.Bruxish also has some huge competitive viability if it has good enough stats and if it gets a great evolution or if it gets one at all it will become the go to mon in OUDoubles since stuff like Gale Wings Brave Bird Aerilate Quick Attack Extreme Speed Belly Drum Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch are used immensely and putting a stop to all of this will definitely balance things a lot more poor Azumarill first Volcanion now this. But only if it gets a great evolution or if its stats are flat out amazing.Vikavolt is a mon Im a bit conflicted of since Im not sure yet of its primarily a physical or special hitter or even mixed but either way this thing definitely has a lot of potential. Levitate while I wasnt really agreeing with at first but now I am does give it a useful immunity to something that would normally do neutral damage and this is a good thing considering all the heavy hitters with Earthquake. An immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes can definitely be useful as well. Now I wonder what moves it will learn for my final verdict Bug Buzz and Thunderbolt are a pretty big given do alongside Roost reliable recovery yay.now the reason I want to talk about Charjabug separately is because it itself has good enough competitive potential and this all comes from its ability Battery which rises your partners SpAtk by one stage this can come in handy especially for heavy hitting special mons like Primal Kyogre or Thunderus and if Charjabug has good enough defenses it can run an Eviolite and tale hits better.Drampa Im more conflicted then Vikavolt since again I cant tell if its physical or special but I feel it will be primarily Special because of its ability which rises SpAtk speaking of which Beserk does have an interesting concept and I can see Drampa running a Focus Sash set in case it doesnt have good enough defenses. Its Normal typing does give it an extra weakness but not only does it get an immunity but it will also have access to so many coverage moves since Normal has probably the biggest diversity when it comes to move selection and this can definitely give Drampa an advantage.Cutiefly in case it doesnt evolve which I doubt will probably be just another dex filler type of pokemon weak and not such a great move selection not to mention not so good abilities well maybe Shield Dust but thats that its typing is interesting but I will some usage in lower tiers probably NU or PU but again only in case it doesnt evolve.Togedemaru still need to get used to that name is definitely the pikaclone with a lot more potential then the others sure the Ground weakness will bite it hard in the ass but its typing will compensate a lot since ElectricSteel is tied with GhostSteel for the most resistances in the game at  iirc and its ability Iron Barbs definitely fits a defensive pokemon like this possibly running a Iron BarbsRocky Helmet set like Ferrothorn.So these are my thoughts what do you think ?,pokemon,d4xtycj,5,t5_2qmeb

Since there come new trainers every minute they have to queue up to fight him and that queue gets longer each minute. So a friend of the gym leader comes along and goes hey Ill help you to defend this gym this is gonna be fun!. The gym leader finds this a great idea adding his friends name to his on the gym signs. Now multiply that by .How shall we get our names on this gyms sign? I know we make a team! And well call us... Team Red!So team Red puts signs all over the gym declaring gym being lead be team Red.Meanwhile across town a group of friends finds this unoccupied gym in an old fabrication building. Hey look an unoccupied gym! We should totally take it for ourselves! Lets make Jimmy the gym leader he can stomp people with his Charizard if they get past the rest of us.OK lets call ourselves... Team Blue what do you think guys?Great idea does have a nice ring to it.OK then from now on were Team Blue.Now trainers from Team Red find the gym across town and decide we should totally kick their assess and take the gym.Meanwhile Team Blue goes around school talking to their friends to get them to join Team Blue so they can defend against the inevitable attack of the thousands of team Red trainers and maybe even claim the second gym in town for team Red too.

You just think its excessive price gouging because its something you dont agree with. It has metal tvalves and metal braided connector hose. It has a self cleaning nozzle and variable temppressure. Its pretty good quality and well worth . It SAVES you money because you use a lot less toilet paper. You dont have to buy as much and you dont have to empty your septic as much either. It saves time because its quicker than just paper and also makes it so you never have to plunge from accidentally using too much paper. Its better all around so its really strange why it has never caught on in the usa and even stranger when people actively resist the upgrade not just you my sister thinks they are weird as well.

8237405,0,t3_4s60l6,Generation Positives I liked how the middle portion was nonlinear. It made it feel like my own adventure. It also gave us the basis that all future games were based upon so you have to appreciate that. Mewtwo had great buildup if you read all of the journal notes in Cinnabar. I also liked exploiting the game it made it possible for my level  Ivysaur to defeat Giovannis Gym Nidoqueen. Broken but fun.Negatives SP Attack and SP Defense being one stat was interesting but made a few Pokemon brokenly powerful. Psychic types were a bit broken. Wrap and Fire Spin were a nightmare to deal with though I admittedly abused them in the EGeneration Positives Two full regions plus we got to see what the Kanto cast was up to and how things changed for them. Reds battle was great.Negatives The level curve going into Kanto was a bit steepGeneration Positives The Battle Frontier was great for adding variety to battles and providing a good challenge though I didnt like how they handled the level limits in it and much preferred the Gen  way of doing it I loved the music and the general feel of the region. Double Battles are my favorite way to play. Plus the spinoffs in this generation are great. Colosseum and XD were a lot of fun and I loved transferring Pokemon between my GBAGC games and taking on Mt. Battle with different combinations from all of my GBAGC teams. It just had an atmosphere that no Pokemon generation has been able to recapture for me since though that may be nostalgia talking and I still love every other generation.Negatives The little variety in Pokemon owned by the villainous teams. I think each team uses about  evolution lines each and every main team member has a CarvanhaNumel. There are so many other Water types and Ground types in this game why not use them?Generation Positives The PhysicalSpecial split was great and allowed a lot of Pokemon I wanted to use prior to it but just couldnt because their stats didnt match their typing or moves too well usable.Plus HGSS added the PokeAthlon and walking Pokemon two of my favorite mechanics in the whole series.Negatives The slowness of the gameplay the lack of Pokemon in the regional Dex in DP not even using every Pokemon they created for the generation complete with two Fire Type families. Luckily these were fixed in Platinum.Generation Positives I quite liked the overworld art style and how unique it was. I liked a lot of the Pokemon and character designs. The story was a step up from the past games and the idea of freeing Pokemon was an interesting one. I like the mythology behind the main legendaries. Creating sequels instead of a third version was also a good move in my opinion especially since BW didnt need touching up. The World Tournament is a great idea too. I also liked the decision to only feature new Pokemon in the main story it was very refreshing.Negatives Pokemon Musicals were cute but compared to other sidequests like Contests and PokeAthlon it just wasnt as fun or deep. How few Pokemon the Gym Leaders had didnt make them that difficult Lenora asideGeneration Positives Trainer customization the leap to D was great I loved all of the new designs Noivern Greninja Heliolisk Avalugg Tyrantrum Dragalge and Slurpuff come to mind the EXP share was great for training up Pokemon postgame the music was great a lot of the characters such as Looker were wellwritten the sheer variety in Pokemon obtainable in the story was great and PokemonAmie was great for feeling more connected to my team.I also feel like Im in the minority of people who liked Team Flare and Lysandre. Ive always liked silly villains that you dont take seriously becoming huge threats later on. I mean their plan was a retread of Cyrus but they did it for different reasons.Negatives The lack of Pokemon owned by Gym Leaders and Elite Four members and how rematches with Gym Leaders are incredibly easy how most random trainers on routes have only one Pokemon each the lack of a real postgame outside of Lookers story which I really liked some parts felt unfinished like the race track above the route. I would have loved a Pokemon racing minigame and the Kantofanbase pandering all of the giftforced encounterlegendary Pokemon were from Gen  or Lucario and it doesnt really make sense to have a Mewtwo in the Pokemon Village. Does that mean there are two Mewtwo or did the one from Kanto escape?,pokemon,d578c7h,3,t5_2qmeb

8466953,1,t3_4vmxgd,Im not sure its such a good thing as you seem to believe. It feels more like theyre just doing the easy thing by cashing in on nostalgia rather than trying to innovate and come up with new ideas. Gen VI never really gave the new Pokmon a chance to shine because the focus was placed so heavily on older species and the plot and characters of Kalos were a major fumble. With todays announcement it looks like the Gen VII batch is also going to get robbed of their chance at the spotlight. And lets not forget how much criticism GameFreak got for reusing so many of the same ideas with Gen Vs species. Instead of pandering to everyones rosetinted memories Id rather they give us the chance to fall in love with something new for a change.,pokemon,d5zwoep,1,t5_2qmeb

Interested in seeing the Ghost Poison Flying and Psychic ones specifically. Wondering how these will be used in competitive. Alola forms look cool though Exeggutor is derpy as hell. I like the concept though  some unusual type combinations there. Sounds like the forms are just the default for these Pokemon in this game. Can we only get the originals by trading? And are these new entries in the Alola Pokedex even though theyre named the same as the originals?  Not fully sure what the Kahuna and Totem things were. Seems like a core part of the plot progression. Kinda hope theres still an E but Ive read that well be able to make our own. New Pokemon are okay. None of them really grab me.

8497863,0,t3_4w413m,What moves to pick is a matter of personal strategy dependant on the Pokmon you use.Some Pokmon have stats that support a particular playstyle.My personal opinion on the matter is to have a Pokmon focus on using either Physical or Special Attacking moves while having a diverse TypeCovering MovePool like knowing both FirePunch and ThunderPunch.This way it allows for you to cover a Pokmons attackfocusweakness with a different TeamMemberas in having one Pokmon focus on using Physical Attacks while another uses Special Attacks and thereby simply choose between them as EnemyPokmon with a particular kind of defence comes up.However as said before it is mostly a matter of preference and strategy.A TypeDiverse MovePool on a Pokmon is however almost always the wise option.In regard to evolution.You are playing Generation  which means there isnt much to lose from allowing your Pokmon to evolve as soon as they can.Some Pokmon learn moves earlier or exclusively while at earlier EvolutionStages however in the later Pokmongames there are simple means for acquiring these moves anyway or replace them with something better.If youd have been playing an early Pokmongame this would have been a far more complicated matterI hope this helps.,pokemon,d63s8mx,2,t5_2qmeb

8505280,0,t3_4w7pkf,Sorry in advance for rantingventing.I have no idea what your talking about in reference to the anime but i just want to say. The lack of common sense is one of the reasons why I stopped watching the anime. I stopped during Sinnoh mainly because I was getting olderI think I was  and the show was just becoming total shit to me.Im not trying to shit on the anime or the fans of the anime. If you want to watch a kids show watch it. I wont judge. Its just my personal opinion dont get offended by it.Almost every episode had plot holes plus it was the same fucking shit over and over again. The series really is for children theres tonnes of shit that really doesnt makes sense when it should.After watching Pokemon Origins I realised that the Pokemon Anime is just plain terrible at representing the actual Pokemon game. Pokemon fights in the Anime seem to be more down to luck than anything else. Ash needs to come back in  years time with a freshly evolved Raichu and a better anime that everybody can enjoy not just children. ,pokemon,d64pqhy,-6,t5_2qmeb

8506791,0,t1_d64939i,Some scientists argue that symbiosis includes all biological relationships good or bad.My objection is more along the lines that if both organisms require each other to live it sounds more like mutualism than parasitism to me.  If the Bulbasaur is going to die without the bulb then I fail to see how its association with the bulb is more harmful than helpful.  Bulbasaur provides locomotion and access to nutrients and the bulb provides enhanced physicalmental traits as well as you know helping the Bulbasaur not die.Furthermore it seems odd for an organism to have evolved such that it could only survive with the assistance of an organism that takes over its higher brain functions.Of course thats me speaking as a boring old biologist.  Speaking as a pokemon fan this is very well done and a fascinating theory.,pokemon,d64wk58,4,t5_2qmeb

And for the rest of my life whenever I refered to him I called him BrucetheBootlegClown.

8510324,0,t1_d65bvyp,Its hard to say for sure what the relationship is between Director and Chief Director is because most of the work therein depends quite heavily on the working environment. Generally the Chief Director has the final say on things and the anime will match that persons vision. Nevertheless the Director remains influential to that vision. Its a little easier to imagine if you think of the Director as the Chief Directors personal assistant.I meant to imply that any contract Sudo may have had with OLM was probably restricting him to Pokmon so once it expired hed be allowed to work on their other inhouse projects. Ykai Watch was booming in popularity at that moment so a producer probably convinced him that his talent and years of experience would be best spent on that series. Dont worry about it.

But the fact remains that Animes still quite popular in the west youll find someone whos watching Anime in almost the same volumes as before.Inversely lets be real the number of quality cartoons airing in an era have decreased. I think we all remember the late s Spiderman Animated series and Batman The Animated Series and XMen all running at the same time for years on end. Each were excellent in their own rights.

They are playing randomizers that you can not take onto WIFI and use the Pokemon in battles as LEGAL mons. That creates problems in wifi be it trading or battling. . You call it a stupid way then proceed to explain nothing. Regardless of whether its the first route or not the idea is not to be able to roll the dice and fill your dex with things you couldnt get other wise. It  takes away from the main reason for the game. Going out and finding Pokemon. . Doesnt matter getting that one Arceus or Mew or Manaphy or Shaymin is more than enough to be problematic. Why make them event Pokemon when I can just hope for them to appear in a Randomizer. Conclusion Introducing a Randomizer takes away from the foundation of Pokemon. Catching them all. Theyre not going to go against that.Dont bother replying I already know its going to be pedantic emotional rubbish.,pokemon,d6atoki,5,t5_2qmeb

8647043,0,t3_4ybmcd,Well was able to launch Homebrew on it.However I didnt found a way to downgrade my ..E to a firmware somewhere around .X.X. Maybe it was possible once but seems to be fixed. Therefore there doesnt seem to be a valid way to do so anymore. I found something about a fieldrunners exploit but way too complicated and not possible for me.Guess thats it then. Maybe in the following months someone will find a proper exploit. Unless someone knows how to do it here.I actually expected to be able to do with a homebrew Sysdowngrader but no dice finding something.I might try that PCHex tool later. But as far as I see it can only edit add pokemon in the box? There is no way to inject something like a event into the save? I mean triggering one so the person in the supermarket gives it to you. Or is there?Ok after spending time  hours with all the stuff like Homebrew PKHex PCHex save manager I figured everything out. QR method is totally unneeded nowadays. I was able to properly inject wondercards into my save with legit pokemon. Works like a charm. I might set up a guide for newbies how to do this later.,pokemon,d6mhps3,1,t5_2qmeb

8762188,0,t1_d70xbc3,Well yea even those random battles on Battle Spot rated will need IVs lol. I dont think you will have to SR for months at all though for Battle Spot. Just dont keep any legendary with absolute trash IVs in the stats you need. Remember you dont need Atk for Special attackers or vice versa.   IVs are guaranteed so get those in the important stats get nature and SR for at least decent  in the others. Speed is quite important for a lot of pokemon so get that  for sure. You dont want to lose Speed ties just cause of that. SunMoon will have hyper training to increase IVs which is great but we dont know how accessible it will be yet. And nature is more important than IVs. SRing is dependent on how picky you arethe people who are at it for months are going for a shiny or absolutely s across the board. ,pokemon,d70xnt1,3,t5_2qmeb

Often times unless the mega gets a huge attack boost i.e. Mega Medicham Mega Mawile Mega Charizard X life orb gives a greater attack boost than the mega stone so your plan might not work.Obviously there are other reasons to use a mega stone besides an attack boost for example you dont use Mega Metagross for the attack boost necessarily you use it for the attack AND speed boost.  This is why Im really curious about this Mega Bisharps stats.  If it gets a big speed boost it might be worth using Mega Bisharp over Bisharp purely based on that.,pokemon,d74xrm5,1,t5_2qmeb

8795100,0,t1_d74ywmy,Your purely physical answer to how experiences exist is that they dont exist because theyre nonphysical. Its all just things doing stuff. That kinda feels like begging the question to me.Given that from my perspective my own consciousness in the sense of the feelings and thoughts I experience is selfevident this argument rings hollow to me. I can prove the existence of my own thoughts to myself much more directly than what would be required to check the existence of anything outside my head. Now proving the existence of other peoples thoughts isnt something I can do. From my perspective they are just things doing stuff. I can imagine their experiences match mine when their stuff does the same things as me but as I said Ive only got a sample size of me to go on.Which is why this whole line of thought feels fruitless to me. Theres no empirical way to test experiences particularly since any any empirical data would be filtered through my consciousness anyway. Therefore as an empiricist I can only shrug and file the question away as pointless to ask. But that doesnt disprove the existence of other minds and such. Science postulates a purely physical reality out of pragmatic necessity but it is just that. An unproven axiom we assume to be true because it works best that way.Any other consciousnesses reading this can feel free to sub in your own pronouns for that part.Admittedly Im in no position to talk about pointless endeavours given that Im on the Pokemon reddit trying to argue the inherent limitation of objectivity.,pokemon,d751voh,0,t5_2qmeb

8838492,0,t1_d7a8d2d,Gijinka is Japanese for personification. Its basically when you create a humanversion of a Pokemon.    Role playing is when you pretend to be your character. I know it sounds slightly insane when you put it like that but its like writing a story except each person is responsible for one character and you spin a plot and world around them.    This girl I RPd with had a character based off a Jolteon  so a human Jolteon basically. He was a blank slate. She didnt give him any personality any character depth an overly tragic back story unrealistic flaws...    The frustration I felt was the same as if you saw a badlywritten character in a novel or a TV show. And the same way a single character can sometimes make you dislike a bookshow her portrayal of her Jolteon Gijinka left me with lasting resentment towards the actual Pokemon.

Then when its successful they try to fuse themselves with Pokemon creating the Ultra Beasts possibly tying in with the GladionLillieLusamine theories that are floating around. Additionally it goes a little way towards explaining TypeNull as well which also seems to be manmade and an attempt at splicing lots of different Pokemon together into a chimera.

8851754,0,t1_d7bublz,I recommend playing Pokemon X or Y for the Nintendo DS.They are really beginnerfriendly they do a great job introducing Mega Evolutions a new addition to  the franchise and they offer the most amount of Pokemon to date that amount being  of them.They are also up to date in terms of mechanics features and graphics since they are the second to last entry in the franchise right now.As a bonus X amp Y have been influenced a lot by Red amp Blue and there are multiple nods to them that arent there in other games. Youll also be happy to know that you can choose one of the three Kanto starters at an early point in the game!gt I love grinding and couldnt care less about graphics and staying up to date.HeartGold and SoulSilver for the Nintendo DS have the most features and content out of any Pokemon game. Theyre also sequels to Red amp Blue.Black and White for the Nintendo DS have the best story and characters as well as the most complete soundtrack in my opinion.  If you end up playing and liking Black  White you must play the sequel Black   White .Notes The consoles of the Nintendo DS family are compatible with Nintendo DS cartridges. You can download Red Blue or Yellow from the Nintendo eShop and store them digitally in your DS in case you want to have a nostalgic playthrough.,pokemon,d7but3t,3,t5_2qmeb

Overhauling the story structure is fine so long as its done in a viable way.

8893800,0,t1_d7gwg6c,I think Noivern is really victim of planning bad luck more than anything. After being hatched Noibat remained not terribly useful for several episodes missing out on the Anistar Gym Battle and given that XY Ash actually uses type advantage if possible he didnt use Noivern in either of the battles against Wulfuric. That left him with no official matches to take part into and with the League being pretty compressed and focused on Ashs main battles with his rivals Noivern had to take part in battles where it had to eventually lose even if he still tied with a pseudolegendary during the match with Sawyer.Also XY was an heavily arcbased series and Noivern didnt have one to speak of. Pikachu gets a pass due to being the Big Good of the team and having been around the whole series Greninja had major focus as the protagonist Talonflame had as much spotlight as a classic Ashs bird and always managed to be reliable Goodra had his own arc and while Hawlucha was similarly arcless he had lots of personality and character to show off. Aside from his being basically Hawluchas adopted son and their cute bond with each other Noivern really didnt have much to do in the series.Its a shame since I really like Noivern but I think its really not anyones fault that he ended up in this situation. I assume if XY got just a bit more episodes he couldve had some other good moments as well.,pokemon,d7gwp5f,20,t5_2qmeb

8954859,0,t1_d7o5j7m,Vegeta and Gohans character development in this last arc is lacking at best. The only two moments I remember them having was Vegeta sparring with Trunks in which all that developed was a father son moment to get Trunks to want to be stronger even when Black was defeated and Gohans family life. Theyre not exactly new characterizations and have been shown or stated in either past episodes or series Vegeta is always going to want FuturePresent Trunks to be stronger and has a deep care for him despite not really showing it and it was pretty established that Gohan has all but given up on fighting and lives a happy regular life. Of course it is still early in the Black Arc and there could be more but what we got is just rehashing what we already know.The current villain is pissed that mortals would dare raise their fists against gods I get that. But why is he going after ALL mortals races that arent even Saiyans for that matter when only two individuals could possibly stand oppose them and in a parallel timeline in which they were already dead. Also in that timeline neither Goku or Vegeta wouldve possibly met him or wouldve had the power level to even pose a threat if they had met. Is Future Trunks timeline just the one timeline to shit on? There is already a balance in effect in the first place if mortals could ever pose that much of a threat to the Gods Zeno could literally wipe them off with a thought. Its not likeits unprecedented for him to wipe anything out of reality.Just changing hair colors again is what I considered ridiculous and lazy. They couldve gone with a number of different ways to show a power level increase. I dont care about Broly hes not even cannon. I dont hate DBS Im just disappointed. With so many years and technological advances since DBZ you would think that a new series would be superior in every way.

Heat Wave? Up comes the floor for protection then using that floor piece as a launchpad for an attack. It was taking the information they know and using the environment to their advantage.Kalos was kinda hard to say as the battle was a bit more like Sinnohs.

9020988,0,t3_53t1ue,gtA Lycan is a mythological creature that is kind of like a werewolfThats not really true. Lycan is just short form of lycanthrope which is literally a manwolf and is used exchangeably with werewolf.There are different types of werewolves in different folklores. Some transform at will some transform with the moon. Some werewolf stories even say their transformation is triggered by something completely different.The word lycos means literally wolf so its unlikely that it was used by any group of people to refer to something other than an animal.

9023716,0,t1_d7wdoi7,Your point is received but I think you slightly missed mine. OP commented that he preferred Gen IIIVII because the pokemon looked like real living creatures as opposed to those in Gen IIIIVVVI that looked like tricked out digimon. In my response I was arguing that all the Gens have had a large spectrum of designs ranging from simple to complex. I wasnt attempting to say that either designs were good or bad or that Gen I was overly simple I was merely stating that nearly all pokemon have clear inspiration derived from real life itemsanimals. Granted some designs are more fantastic or exaggerated than others but my point was that some pokemon from Gen I were overly exaggerated as well. There were some obvious ones too though.As for your point on simplicity I understand it but I kind of disagree. I liked some of the over the top designs from Gen IIIIVVVI. When we get down to brass tacks pokemon are wildly diverse creatures that essentially have super powers. I think its a little much to assume that every pokemon needs to be simple when there are some that control time can pull mountains or create hurricanes. Even in real life some of the smallest and most mundane creatures are exceedingly elaborate for no readily apparent reason.In the end I think its a matter of preference. You and OP are more than welcome to appreciate the simplistic designs over the more elaborate or farfetched heh designs from the later gens but that doesnt mean those more elaborate designs look any less like actual pokemon.,pokemon,d7wicix,4,t5_2qmeb

9028764,0,t3_53x06v,No its getting easier. X was probably the most handholdy game Ive ever played.  My girlfriend who had never played Pokemon before in her life started with Y and found it too easy. She didnt even know what happens when all your Pokemon faint until she played White and suddenly started complaining about having to buy potions and revives and not having much money.Its not just me getting better. Im so sick of this supposed contrast between real difficulty and artificial difficulty. Arguments like more convenient healing just cuts time  and that makes it easier. I dont want to be healed everywhere. I dont want my rival to heal me in front of each battle. If I fuck up and dont bring enough heal items I want to lose and be sent back. It does more than just cut out the time you would spend going back  it also cuts out the possibility of failure and that is almost by definition making it to easy.I remember some really challenging enjoyable battles where a rival has surprised me from nowhere at the end of a hardfought cave or gauntlet. And now? Oh fuck four of my pokemo wait free healing? Oh okay Ill sweep their whole team with one. Grindinghigh levels may not be real difficulty but I think this one is a bit of a straw man. Not once have I had to grind in Pokemon before the elite four. Simply by never running from any battle and never avoiding a trainer I quickly gain levels and become overlevelled. I remember arriving at the E in X healing up and challenging it right way with Pokemon  levels higher. Not a single battle of grind. The only time I grind is when I decide from whatever demonic compulsion that i want to get a particular pokemon up to level . I wish I had to grind in the main game. It would at least bring in some kind of tactical element  who would be the most effective pokemon to grind the biggest bang for the least grind?,pokemon,d7x45ta,4,t5_2qmeb

Theres already a lot of bad designs as is might as well keep pumping them out for a handful of goods ones to pop up among hitting all the nails for certain peoples taste. I couldnt name half of the SampM pokemon off the top of my head but the more there is the more likely the chance of me really liking a few of them.The number only becomes a problem with the whole online backwards compatibility thing. The stories have been fine focusing on the new pokemon while filling the rest of the holes with some older pokemon. Just the bank thing that gets in the way. Id be fine if we had games sanction off entire gens for the NX and just focus on a themesettingregion that would mix up the online meta more I would think and make each game more special if you wanted to play using certain pokemon. I got oras and started gts trading immediately and got a lot of my favorites yet I was only able to play like  hours because of been there done that with the same pokemon Im familiar with. I was finally bored. Because it was just that a remake of pokemon Ive already usedplayed with. Capping at a  means youre going to be limited to the same old experience each game. alola forms are fine but to me it still counts as the same pokemon. Megas were only for in online battles. Both take up spots I rather be actual new and unique looking pokemon rather than a subspecies of old ones weve used to encounterplay with.

Im not too sure how useful it is normally. I believe it also blocks teleport? good for roamers thoughSoak  what if your catch target is a ghost and immune to false swipemean look or is a grass type that is immune to spore? Soak is your answer! also allows ghosts to be trapped and rocksteel types to not be super resistant to false swipeheal block  for that pesky mewtwo who has recoverDamp  great ability to stop those explosive pokemon who have had too much mexican food.magic guard  Several pokemon have recoil moves that will let it kill itself If you have a pokemon with magic guard you can skill swap it to the target catch pokemon. Magic guard prevents recoil damage! problem solved. Also works with poison and burn damage. Doesnt work with struggle though but theres a method for struggling pokemon below.Telepathy  ever find a shiny geodude in a horde and then despair cus they will totally magnitude each other to death? A skilled swapped telepathy onto a target will render it immune to its allies attempts to kill it. problem solvedHarvest  This one has more limited options but for long catch battles where your target runs out of pp and starts to use struggle you can use Skill swap  harvest  trick  leppa berry to get the target to restore some pp and not struggle to death. With sunlight harvest will always activate so you can be sure your target wont run out of pp.i think that will cover most if not all pokemon capture targets.

9174048,0,t1_d8ev6gv,As of December   the Project M Development Team ultimately decided to conclude developing the mod shutting down their official page and removing the download links from the site leaving a farewell message on the main page where the developers feel their work and last version of Project M complete and therefore pursue original ventures. Reasons for the conclusion werent clearly specified but according to a tweet legal issues were not the cause with the cease of the mod. Later on a statement from a former member of the development team explained that it was a preemptive measure for fear of potential legal issues against Nintendo in the future in which the team voluntarily finished the development of Project M altogether.If you believe your project infringes on a companys copyright you may decide to end it. If you believe it doesnt you may still believe the company will because of incompetence or malice sue you unjustly and you may or may not pull your project preemptively. As far as I know the Pokemon copyright holders havent tried something this stupid on any hacks. Pokemon Brown also from Rijon was created in  and is still available.,pokemon,d8evmld,18,t5_2qmeb

9184065,0,t1_d8fb4l9,Have you people not watched the Mega Evolution Specials? Alain went through  mega evolution trainers in a roll with an elite  being the last one. Sure Alain used potions after everything win bur Charizard was still exhausted and you could clearly see he had scratches still. Charizard tanked hits from Zygarde and also Mega Rayquaza. Mega Rayquaza was able to KO primal Groudon and Kyogre with a dragons ascent while Charizard survived it since he didnt exit Mega form unlike Groudon and Kyogre he exited Primal form. Have you even watched the fight between Steven and Alain too? Charizard took a serious beating from Metagross and was still able to fight. Stevens Metagross is not weak at all. By not weak I means hes the only one to survive a direct hit from Charizard blast burn. It was super effective too. Not even Malvas Houndoom could survive it.Not sure why people are surprised Charizard isnt exhuasted after a tbolt and a few hits from Greninja. Charizard has taken way more in the past and the fight against Ash shouldnt be surprise. Its not like Charizard got KOd by a bullet seed in the previous episode.,pokemon,d8g5bql,2,t5_2qmeb

9237133,0,t3_56tg2q,I feel like adding a party system where you could unlock people to bring with you and have access to one of their best Pokmon would be cool. Itd have to be rare or iconic Pokmon like after beating Sabrina you can have her join your party and you can use her Alakazam. It would unlock dialogstories and quests for each person who could join the party. Sorta like mass effects party experience but would make sense in the world. You have to sacrifice a slot in your party but you get a free rare Pokmon. As for story I think itd be cool to have you be a trainer competing in like a gym race for a prize. Like a bunch of trainers travel to a region given starters and see who can get all the gym badges first. Then its revealed the top  times compete for the championship. The evil organization could be looking to either rig the game or take advantage of all the trainers not having acess to their stronger Pokmon and the bounty of starter Pokmon. ,pokemon,d8mvhow,1,t5_2qmeb

9251416,0,t3_5735qt, THEORY  Someone prove me wrong.Does anyone else think that this might have a small chance of being fake? I was excited at first but on the second look Im a bit skeptical. Its also odd that we havent received scans of the exclusive scoop on Type Null.For one thing the Alolan Grimer is overlapping the Meowth as if it was just pasted on with the sign for the number four. And isnt that the same pose that Meowth was in during the last issue of CoroCoro when it was revealed with Marowak and Exeggutor? I somewhat recall those images being apart of demonstrations and teaser trailers for Sun and Moon so itd be easy to fake since Grimer requires only a color swap. I also find it odd that his radioactive waste beard is the color that they chose to make the background. Anyone get the feeling that this could be proven false?,pokemon,d8oomp2,22,t5_2qmeb

9329785,0,t1_d8yjcbs,Basically it will potentially force a Pokmon to be shiny depending on several factors.First your Search Level comes into play.  As you encounter Pokmon it increases.  At the unfortunate cap of  you have   . as a special number.  Then the game rolls a number from  to .  If your number is higher than you win yourself a shiny.  So basically  chances out of  due to starting at .So let us say that you rolled a high number.  That means no shiny.  Well then fear not because the DexNav does not just roll once!  ...well it can roll only a single time but you can also get more chances to roll again.  For example there is a second game going on in addition to the first with numbers  to .  The game rolls a different number for this new game and if it is a    or  then you get to play the main game another four times for four more chances to hit a number under ..  Additionally a player with a Shiny Charm get two extra chances right off the bat.  And if you were chaining Pokmon and are at number  or  in the chain they you get  or  chances more chances respectively.  So you might end up with a total of  chances to roll a number under . at the end.  And if you still do not win then there is still a chance for it to be naturally shiny.,pokemon,d8ym9k8,6,t5_2qmeb

9348983,0,t1_d8znw52,So to use Zmoves you need a Pokemon to hold a Zcrystal and have at least one attack of the corresponding type of the Zcrystal i.e. thunderbolt and ElectriumZ from the demo. Then on the battle menu when you click the Zmove tab you cant miss it a new screen overlays on top of the normal battle menu and one version of the Zmove appears per appropriate move i.e. having nuzzle and electroball gives you two options for which version of gigavolt havoc you wish to use. The power of each variation of a Zmove is dependent on which move you select GameFreak probably has some weird formula for figuring out base power conversion. Once you pick which move is powered up by zpower it uses one of that moves pp.,pokemon,d911uv4,2,t5_2qmeb

Also there have been  Deoxyses in Movie  and  Latioses. Legendary Pokemon most of them are not capable of breeding if they are then most likely it is asexual reproduction.

I know its probably been suggested to you already but you can try a Nuzlocke you know.But tell me what would you like to see out of a challenge mode? I think one way I would make the game more challenging for example is to make the routes between healing points longer. I always dread a good long slow path to my next city. It would also be nice if the pokemon of the trainers you faced would change in level depending on the level of your pokemon. It might eliminate the need for level grinding and certain trainers could be overleveled and others underleveled to allow for specific trainers to be made very challenging.,pokemon,d92n97o,5,t5_2qmeb

Once they find the sweet spot between what can be offered on mobile and what the audience enjoys most about Pokmon better battling and meaningful relationships with your Pokmon the game will prosper. I think some of the disappointment with the game was that the trailer really sought to project it as this immersive experience that you could enjoy with friends and family.

Plus something not being present in established canon is highly irrelevant since were now in a completely new universe where stuff like primal reversion taking place in Hoenns ancient history is a thing.A generation or two ago your points would be pretty definite but its very easy for them to implement new stuff in remakes now that ORAS happened. Its also not out of the question for them to have evolved more or less the same under two different circumstances on different parts of the globe. Especially since Japan and Alola are right there.

9447998,0,t3_5a4f5w,From the wikigt Name origingt Although Leaf is by far the name she is most commonly known by among Englishspeaking fans she has no official given name. The names popularity stems from its usage as a placeholder name for the character in Trainer data on the ROMs of Pokmon FireRed and LeafGreen but this derivation is contentious because by way of contrast the equivalent name for the rival Blue Terry does not match any of his canonical names. That inconsistency leads some fans to prefer the name of her Adventures counterpart as a more logical choice GreenBlueJPampKOR.her name is usually leaf except in the Pokemon Adventures manga where her name is Green.though the name leaf is simply what people like to call her. so unless she pops up as a prenamed NPC like red and blue have then we just have opinionated names. and this little reddit post isnt gonna change that for everyone ever.,pokemon,d9dlm09,8,t5_2qmeb

In addition to the main save file the games write some sort of small sync file in DS internal memory where it cannot be reached without a cheat device.  The sync file has to match the save file or the game declares the save to be corrupt.If you copy everything over to your new SD card including the main save file without changing anything in the copy process then the two will still match and you are good.OTOH if you back up your save export pokemon and then restore your backedup save the files no longer match and the game will refuse to load.,pokemon,d9h1n6o,2,t5_2qmeb

Replaced the two tail gems with one big gem which I think better suits the chubbier Dragonite and also got rid of the chest gem since I just didnt think it looked right. I also made his coloration a bit more vivid since I think it plays to the overall designs strengths ie the friendly dinosaur vibe.

9543089,0,t1_d9p0zzs,They are not supposed to make sense from our perspective. Each and every team leader is definitely immersed in their own goal and want to do all they can to make it reality.Maxie and Archie are incredibly idealistic of their plans succeeding and believe in them and ORAS gave them believable reasons for wanting more land prohumanity or more water proPokmon.Cyrus is a true misanthrope who wanted a world of nothing so him destroying the world completely would likely be his actual end point anyway given his ideal world is one without emotions at all.N is an extreme idealist himself who wants Pokmon to stop suffering at the hands of trainers and initially believes his cause to be righteous considering also Masudas Word of God that N saw himself as perfect while Ghetsis just nurtured said idealism to suit his own ends to conquer Unova. Definitely the most logical plan in BW while by BW he definitely is way more unhinged and blinded with rage which shows in both how he acts once you meet him in person and how much more ruthless Neo Team Plasma acts.Lysandre is utterly and completely pissed off at how the world is now and wants to cleanse it from those he considers unworthy via complete genocide of everyone save his own handpicked chosens. Its no coincidence people compare Team Flares ideology to Nazis.Basically I feel each of them has reason to believe in what they do and saying they dont make sense is a bit disrespectful especially because the dumber ones Maxie and Archie eventually see the error of their ways Cyrus just disappears in the Reverse World because he cant accept defeat while still swearing to change the world in his own image Ghetsis ends up captured and completely broken after seeing his plans thwarted twice and Lysandre either dies or is immortal and stuck underground forever due to the folly of his ideals.,pokemon,d9pdtg6,3,t5_2qmeb

9550826,0,t1_d9q3b6a,So I had just finished SoulSilvers Johto section after a couple years long story short I couldnt find Lugia and was on my way to Red after handily beating down the Kanto Gym Leaders with a type advantage on every Gym Feraligatr for Pewter Saffron and Blaine PorygonDischarge for Cerulean a traded Moltres for Celadon Lugia for Fuchsia Rhydon for Vermilion and finally Feraligatr Lugia  and Porygon again for Viridian. Having beat all  in quick fashion I caught HoOh curbstomped the Elite Four caught Mewtwo and finally climbed Mt. Silver. Beating Red took all of two hours. Challenging him was hell though I figured out a way around the hail. Long story short I took down Pika with a straight Earthquake then put in a Rain Dance Golduck against Charizard. Then switched in Porygon who by this time knew Thunder and Tri Attack too. This guy took care of Blastoise Lapras and Charizard alone. Then it came to the hard ones i.e. Snorlax and Venusaur. Because I didnt know who was going in first I prayed that my Lugia would do the job. Lo and behold out popped Venusaur. Two Aeroblasts killed the bugger. Finally it was Snorlaxs turn. Snorlax was takes down by a team effort from Feraligatr Moltres and Porygon who all knew powerful moves.Next up was the starters and Latios. Lucky me both Charizard Latios and Sceptile were shiny!I had a living dex up to the mythicals.

9582258,0,t1_d9u75u4,Creating the designs is not hard and Im arguing that point because Masuda made a point to say that the design process is hard due to things like having to visualize it in three dimensions. Making a Pokemons design also does not need to be related to the mechanics at all as many Pokemon have shown that theyre relative stats and traits dont really line up with how the design may look. The new starters are good examples considering from appearance most everyone expected decent speed from Incineroar and Decidueye.From the prospective of an art designer Masuda gave an answer that is completely unsatisfying and rings as untrue. It has been a while and if he later went into the mechanics part Id give that more credence but he spoke purely from a design standpoint in the article I read.,pokemon,d9u7j5n,-1,t5_2qmeb

9582912,0,t1_d9ua6ap,This is specifically why I dont watch the anime. The fights are bullshit and follow no formula. Character development does not exist as they reset Ash after every season anyway and the rest of the cast gets thrown away and maybe gets a cameo in a later season max. As a result Ashs pokemon also dont get stronger. And even if they would you wouldnt notice anyways due to the fights being completely random. In the end you are left with nice animations but not much more.When i take a look at Origins or Generations on the other hand. They are in no way perfect. But they arent stretched out like the whole Ash story which makes it way more believable. I can see Red losing against Mewtwo with his normal Charizard but winning due to the Mega evolution. They dont need to bend much here. And the most important thing... they are able to let a main character go. The whole Pikachu anymore would be way more bearable if they werent so focused on Ash and would switch out the MC after every season.,pokemon,d9uaffu,-7,t5_2qmeb

This is just my own personal opinion but I prefer a smaller amount of new Pokemon that look good then over a hundred and fifty new Pokemon that all except like ten look like trash. There are almost a thousand Pokemon now. We dont need a crapton of new Pokemon a generation. Sixty or seventy new well designed Pokemon per generation sounds about perfect. Add in more Mega evolutions for more and more Pokemon and if they REALLY want to change things up have more new versions of old Pokemon like the Alola forms.,pokemon,d9ut0sv,2,t5_2qmeb

When Groudon and Kyogre were introduced they were the only Legendaries NOT to have a catch rate of  and they were the first to be genuinely versionexclusive. When Palkia and Dialga were introduced their catch rate of  was SIX TIMES the previoushighest for any Legendary. Heatran was the first Legendary to not be part of a DuoTrio. When Reshiram and Zekrom were introduced they were the first Legendaries with the evenhigher catch rate of . N successfully catching one and using it during the main story was also unprecedented. The category of Mythicals was also shaken up in gen   with the first nonMewclone  and gen  with ManaphyPhione.spoilerSo its hardly like this is the first time a previouslyenshrined Rule about Legendaries got stretched. AFAIK like all other Legendaries they still have all the most important aspects theyre unbreedable nonbaby Pokemon they have very high stats and you can catch at most one of each per playthrough.spoiler,pokemon,d9wl7gb,2,t5_2qmeb

9602828,0,t1_d9weazq,Seriously coming into Sun and Moon I went back and replayed the earlier games.  They werent harder.  They just took longer since you had to spend hours battling garbage wild Pokemon to have your team get to a competitive level.  The earlier games seemed harder since youd tend to have a lot more battles without access to a Pokemon Centre hello Blue! trainers tended to have more Pokemon and there were more instances of Pokemon without any real counters limited movepools or annoying strategies Normans Slaking.I get that some people like grinding and let us turn off the Exp Share as it currently is.  But adding back grinding wont make the game any harder.  In order to do that you need to have trainers with better balanced teams more pokemon and most importantly better AI.  You can add a level buff but again generally speaking that doesnt necessarily correlate to harder just more grind.,pokemon,d9wqtvi,8,t5_2qmeb

Pokmon is more complex than anybody thinks personally i dont watch the anime i dont like animes at all though except for some Artistic ones  but i do enjoy the soundtrack and the gameplay of all the games i played a lot of Mystery Dungeon in my youth in my early elementary days i used to play on a lent copy of a friends pokmon Blue because my parents dont wanted me to buy one of the pokmons games because back in the days it was something satanic about the rumors and bad omens related to the games but then i grow older bought a Game boy advance bought ruby and kept playing since until the myth was busted and i showed my parents how complex the game really was also we had a deal if got good grades i could have my pokmon games here i am an aspiring master architect waiting for Pokmon Sun  they agreed over time so my advice be a good student thats all your parents want from you at this age dont make stupid things be mature and get some responsibility work some kind of deal pokmon is not bad the competitive side of the games are complex and very easy to learn by now so be smart and dont make a fuss tackle this problem with maturity and talk straight face it instead bad mouthing your parents that WILL work  wish you the best of luck.Also once i get my masters degree i will ask to be called PokmonArchitect Master.,pokemon,d9wv9di,1,t5_2qmeb

Without stealth rocks the ability should function similarly to eject button which while not good enough to compete with life orb choice band or other damaging options is still valuable and combos greatly with focus sash.  I see it as a strong revenge killer similar to weavile or talonflame especially post gale wings nerf.

Just like GS was the limit for GBC and BWBW were the limit for DS. If theyre planning a new handheld then its definitely not going to have worse graphical horsepower. Switch is basically a handheld system so that could count. Style gt graphical fidelity. Making things look realistic makes them dated way faster. Going for a more realistic look would get rid of some of the charm too. I dont think Pokemon as they are now would look good in a more realistic environment since theyre so cartoony in the first place. So I certainly hope not. In terms of graphics just better fidelity and frame rate.,pokemon,da0hh25,3,t5_2qmeb

9654954,0,t1_da35vm7,Alright one Talonflames Gale Wings got nerfed to High Hell. Second the Trick Room argument with these speeds or rather lack of speed most of the meta is gonna consist of Trick Room teams which youll see a lot of the same mons at that point. Also if the meta does become Trick Room and friends then as soon as the thing with Trick Room hits the board youre gonna see a lot of things just go after the Trick Room user because theres no Pokemon with an ability that instantly creates one upon entry.Third the typings and the speed Ghost is a good offensive typing...but it needs to go first unless its bulky Decidueye needed to be Grass Greninja and it ended up falling short everything that can outspeed it can and will kill it without getting a good hit in. Sure the new ones look cool but heres the thing theres not a lot that was done to fix the previous meta they just made everything slow and hit like a few of the Pokemon.Oh and they buffed Megas. Like Sableye got weaker but everyone who mega evolves now turn order is calculated when the mega evolution is done and since a majority of them are super fast and hit real hard....yeah you better hope to god Trick Room goes off.Really the ideal way I wouldve fixed the Mega problem is this if you want to mega evolve you must waste a turn and tank an attack risking it all to get that boost that may help you.,pokemon,da36a0r,14,t5_2qmeb

9690214,0,t1_da7fsjz,It partially is. People want these games to be more or less self contained which they are but Game Freak also wants you to actually talk to other people and cooperate to get some stuff that is difficult to get alone or that you couldnt normally get until later.Threads like these are the sort that if you ever wondered why creators might shy away from their fanbase or not always take fan feedback and implement it quickly now you know why. There are five levels between  and  and keeping Kadabra from learning an attacking move until then means you get a Kadabra being passively trained in the back of your party without it fucking up the games difficulty curve which has been handled way better than XYs curve. Denying players instant gratification is not equal to bad game design nor is incentivizing talking to one another in a game meant to cause people to socialize. ,pokemon,da7ivih,9,t5_2qmeb

9702654,0,t3_5e1tp1,Every Pokemon has its own individual EV payout when you defeat them. EVs provide bonuses to your stats.  EVs translate to  stat point... at level . The bonuses get a bit skewed at the lower levels but they always have an effect. You dont need to worry about that too much just know that they are doing something.You can have  EVs invested into any Pokemon and a cap of  per stat. So for example you could have  Attack EVs  Defense and Special Defense EVs and  HP EVs which would use up your  allowed EVs. This would translate to a  point increase in attack . increase to Defense and Special Defense and a . point increase in HP... at level . Like I said the numbers are a tad harder to calculate at lower levels.Its pretty straightforward. You put EVs into the stats you want to to increase and they go up. Its actually super straightforward a lot of the technical stuff is just nothinginformation that you ultimately dont even need to know. Just know that the stats you invest EVs into are slightly increasing based on how many EVs you invest.Youre always getting EVs when battling. Even when you fight your Rivals starter at the beginning of the game you get EVs from it. Litten for example gives out  Speed EV. Not much but it adds up. Across your adventure your team will probably end up with a fairly even EV spread across all stats if you dont intentionally EV train them.Its a pretty complicated system but as I said you really dont need to know all that much about it. You generally either A Put EVs into the Pokemons best stats to maximize their strengths or B Put EVs into the Pokemons weakest Defensive stats HP Defense Special Defense to counteract their weaknesses.This is ultimately a very short and simple explanation but as I keep saying you really dont need to understand it entirely.,pokemon,da9262t,2,t5_2qmeb

Once youve hatched  eggs go and talk to him and hell upgrade your PC to be able to judge Pokemon directly in your own boxes! No more talking to him a billion times when breeding. In fact he takes off after you talk to him lol.For training if you mean EVs ally chains are going to be your friend. I dont have the specifics handy but functionally its like horde battles only you can theoretically run one chain until maxxed in target stats.If you mean levels in order to access Hyper Training with level  Pokemon it appears that grinding the E is going to be your best bet for now.,pokemon,dab2gg1,2,t5_2qmeb

However molecular studies suggest the giant panda is a true bear and part of the family Ursidae though it differentiated early in history from the main ursine stock. The giant pandas closest extant relative is the spectacled bear of South America. The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.Source,pokemon,dab3zj5,15,t5_2qmeb

You and plenty of others think Mega Evolution isnt going to be expanded upon just because it wasnt placed in the actual story in these two games instead put into postgame  but just because it is a postgame thing now doesnt mean the concept is abandoned.Just because you put Basically doesnt mean squat considering you think the Mega Evolution is on the same scale as Triple Rotation and Inverse Battles  concepts that were never really advertised or expanded upon whereas Megas were given more importance within the franchise in and of itself.,pokemon,dahzap3,0,t5_2qmeb

9777830,0,t3_5f8njb,The introduction is pretty long and the game itself is a bit more cutscene heavy than previous games or at least it feels that way but it is worth it. While I do wish the tutorial was shorter there is a lot for it to cover and Id say it does a good job with it for the most part.Once you get to the city Id say the tutorial is over. There are still a lot of cutscene events but that is just how the game tells the story and it does it well. Other generations may seem less cutscene heavy and perhaps they are a bit but I think it is more than Gen  cutscenes are more obvious since they are a noticeable departure from normal gameplay instead of just text. The path can also feel a bit linear at times but same can be said for past generation too.

9786839,0,t1_dajcgd7,I love the GTS but I know Im in the minority.  With the release of SM I had the goal of getting set up a full Gen Living Dex before the Bank opens.  That is have one of every new pokemon on hand all at the same time.I have GTS gold trade bait sitting in the Bank and I knew that I should be able to do that goal within days of the Bank release but I wanted to challenge myself to do it beforehand.  And I am currently on track to get there.  I do not yet have every one of them but I have picked up enough extra legendaries that I should be able to get the rest with a little effort.The key is to know what to look for.  What are the hot properties?  What are the trades well in my favor?  Someone offering a TypeNull wanting a Toxapex?  Ones Legendary albeit a lesser value one but still one per game.  The other while a challenge to get is not a legendary.  Ill make that trade in a heartbeat even if its my only Toxapex since I know I can trade for another Toxapex a lot more easily than a TypeNull.  Someone dropped a shiny asking for a nonlegendary?  Again Ill take that in a heartbeat as I know I can trade the shiny away again on the GTS for one of my missing legendaries.A lot of it started with my SRing at the beginning of the game to get a female starter.  That let me start breeding very early.  I bred up lots of Litten setting the females aside as higher value trade fodder and trading all away as best as I could.  Eventually I put a female Litten up for a Ditto and got it.  At that point I was no longer limited to breeding females.And things really opened up when I managed to start getting ahold of first some Gen starters then the Gen starters.  Those latter were the gold on the GTS for quite a while as they were in very short supply.  Breed up a lot of them and start trading them away.  Im going to bed for the night?  Lets put up a female Tepig asking for a TypeNull and see if anyone bites overnight.  And it worked twice.  I was up to  TypeNull at one point including my own.It takes some knowledge and effort but the GTS can be very very effective if handled right.,pokemon,dajfvw9,3,t5_2qmeb

9793121,0,t1_dajzu58,gt the island apparently went years without even having a kahuna which would logically prevent children from being able to complete it for that entire duration I mean really what if Hapu hadnt been conveniently appointed at just the moment we needed her to be? Wed have been SOLWeve seen evidence that their rituals are flexible. Remember when they mention that if you and Hau hadnt been available to do the battle dedicated to Tapu Koko during the festival at the beginning that Kahuna Hala would have filled in and done one?My guess is that they have some alternative challenge or ritual if an island is without a Kahuna.

Hurricane or air slash for flying revelation dance for its unique type and round for normal. The only other type of attacks it can learn are physical steel wing uturn and some physical flyingnormal moves like pluck or return.Its physical attack is garbage and nobody is gonna use round so the only attacks youll actually feasibly use on it are hurricaneair slash and revelation dance.

In DPP BW and the GBAGBCGB games they were small a handful of houses and no event happening in them. XY gave them unique themes to give each place its own mood like BW but in XY NPCs gave us piece of lore or even the old man of Anistar city asking for a level  mon. The SunMoon comes at second for virtue of having bigger cities than a neighborhood though.

9813657,0,t1_daluill,My uncle is Mr. Frank Nintendo founder of the Nintendo corporation. I am Johnny Nintendo heir to the throne.  Obviously I dont have sources thats why there is nothing official. But if you read between the lines a story emerges.  . Nintendo has always been adamant about having Pokemon be for mobile consoles. The switch is a mobile console.  . Sun and Moon deemphasize using the bottom screen. Could be a strange design choice could be making the port much easier.  . Why make such high resolution easily scalable d models unless you were planning on eventually scaling them up? The Sun and Moon announcement trailer showed a very high def character model being worked on. . Continuing on the previous thought why is the performance so poor on the ds? The game absolutely chugs at points like  fps. Do you believe the Nintendo developers are so awful at their jobs this was the best they could do? That management saw the awful performance and went Thats ok guys yeah this performance is terrible but you did your best and thats what counts go ahead and ship it. Or do you think its possible the game was designed around eventually being played on a more powerful switch console? . Pokemon is bigger than it has ever been right now. Nintendo has a unique opportunity to capture three audiences again children young adults and older adults who were not so young when Gen  came out playing again for nostalgia.

9844208,0,t1_daqcx7l,GameFreak Public Announcement In regards to current concerns about the speeds of our new th Generation Pokmon we felt the need to give an explanation for our design choices and make things transparent with the fans.You see when we created the Alola region we based it nearly entirely off of the islands of Hawaii taking into account the rich cultural background the flourishing consumerism and tourism and the unexpected traditional urban presence in certain areas. In all of this research one piece of feedback from residents of the islands and tourists alike that felt omnipresent was that Hawaii is a place to relax and unwind where the rush of corporate or business lifestyle is left behind for spectacular sights and soothing seabreezes.It was due to this overarching Hawaiian sentiment that we made all the Pokmon so slow. Let us explain. They relax all day they relax all night. They play and enjoy themselves like any prospering wildlife should. They arent constrained by responsibilities that come with being a bigcity Pokmon these Pokmon are laidback and just concerned with living life and enjoying it. Theres no need to rush when youre just enjoying the air or the sights or the smells of the beautiful atmosphere we designed for Alola. You just unwind and kick back.We knew this change would not be popular with everyone but we truly feel it enriches the already rich wonderful experience that Pokmon Sun and Moon have come to be praised for. Hopefully now our fellow Trainers all around the world understand the crucial cultural inspiration behind these changes. Thank you and Alolagoodbye.,pokemon,daqq1ur,124,t5_2qmeb

If youre going for nature then you can also do speed tests use pokemon with matching speed and wait for a speed tie if the ditto goes first  times in a row it may be holding metal powder.

9899057,0,t3_5glt3n,I have a few questions regarding endgame and team building in Pokemon SunMoon. I beat the elite  and got the IV checker unlocked and have really started working on my team. I bred a bunch of jangmos and rowlets and ended up with about  boxes of wonder trade fodder. I ended up with quite a few miscellaneous high IV Pokemon like a wingull with  perfect IVs. Im somewhat new to the newer gens but from some research it seems like most Pokemon are viable in one way or another. Should I be leveling all these guys up? Right now I have about  miscellaneous Pokmon like AbraSalanditMimikyu hanging out in the Isle Evelup. If anyone has links to guides on this stuff or any input it would be appreciated. Im just looking to build a solid team for some casual play. Thanks. ,pokemon,daxvc6h,1,t5_2qmeb

9900960,0,t1_day3m5m,It is definitely possible to get multiple.  Event farming has been a thing for a number of game generations.That said there is a time investment needed for farming.  You have to restart the game each time and advance it far enough forward to collect the event.  In both Gen games this took about  minutes per cycle.  I purchased an extra copy of Y early on specifically to farm events so I know the cycle quite well.But in SM the amount of time before you reach the PC and have the ability to collect the event pokemon looks to be closer to  minutes.  I am not looking forward to the idea of farming with that amount of time per cycle.And as for Magearna the location where you pick her up is on the second island and Ive seen that you cannot even get her until the post game.But even if it was still  minutes thats a huge time investment to be making for selling them.  Especially when it is far far far easier to just clone them like crazy.So while it is totally possible to farm events the chances that someone did it in mass bulk especially with Magearna are slim to the point of being almost null.  Almost certainly they are cloned.,pokemon,day49e0,2,t5_2qmeb

Didnt Nintendo confirm that there is no backwards compatibility with DS games to the switch? It certainly doesnt use the same cartridges as the DS so even if there is then youd have to get it digitally. Meaning  no back and forth trading between games. Game Freak has never isolated a Generation so badly as this one if this is indeed the case. Also the Article does discredit the fact that Pokemon Stars is set to release late  because first of all they are going to observe how well the Switch sells as said in this article and and see if adding Pokemon to the fire can make more people play itenjoy it.Just  months is not enough time to make a completely new Pokemon game and we all know how bad Game Freak does when they start out on a new Platform.

9950555,0,t1_db469fu,I caught nearly a box full of them because I was trying to get one with a good nature. All you have to do to make Wimpod respawn is to leave and enter the area. However it usually takes a couple tries to respawn. For me it was typically  times sometimes a couple more and I dont remember it ever respawning after only leaving and entering the area once or twice.  Luckily a transition to the next area is right there the one that leads to Route  and Lush Jungle. So I just kept dashing there back and forth on Tauros until one appeared and then would just catch up to it while still dashing with Tauros.   I also found it to be a good way to grind money at least at that point in the game since they always drop a valuable item when you defeat or catch them. They leave at least a Big Pearl behind which sells for k sometimes a Nugget and very rarely a Big Nugget. Ive only gotten that once or twice from them but it sells for k. ,pokemon,db4l04a,2,t5_2qmeb

9956828,0,t3_5i4q7z,It is possible to SOS comp. shiny Pokemon but only with a lot of luck and on Pokemon that dont require egg moves and with the understanding that youll more than likely need to bottlecap one or more IVs.Personally I consider SOS shiny hunting to be more akin to trophies while MM is for competitive shinies. In that regard the two methods arent mutually exclusive they just dont necessarily have the same goal.And of course some Pokemon cannot be SOS chained just like some Pokemon cannot be MMd so I prefer being set up to do both. ,pokemon,db5eeqa,7,t5_2qmeb

9959558,0,t1_db5i0hs,If you get a perfect IV ditto through a wonder trade you know somethings off.The chances of getting a IV ditto are astronomically low and it is an incredibly time consuming process. Assuming that you can chain to  and catch in  lets say  minutes  the chances of getting a IV from that point is  assuming my calcs are correct. You cannot confirm stats so every single one is a blind throw  minutes of time given my rough number which equates to gt hours of pure play time which assuming  hours play a day is  days.  whole days. For a single pokemon that is an absolutely ridiculous number. So high a number nobody sane is going to be doing so and sending them through Wonder Trade and nobody sane will receive it on the other side saying this is obviously legit.If you dont like it theres always a release button. In the end its at best  minutes of your time to save a bunch of people vast amounts of time not just on fetching their own which is infeasible but also the time it saves having to split breed generations.

9959888,0,t1_db5rtke,I dont think we need another Kanto remake but it is the oldest game without a modern remake. FireRedLeafGreen are older than DiamondPearl so well have to wait and see what Gamefreak does for next remakes.Also there is a difference between Kanto and Gen . The Kalos and Alola Pokedex had Pokemon across all generations and the original Pokemon are fairly common across all regions because they are just common Pokemon worldwide it seems. Kanto may have a fair amount of thing related to it but that is because it is the oldest and there is more demand for it. I dont think that being the first game getting one remake VC releases and one special movie means we should never visit that region of the world again.,pokemon,db5ss8d,20,t5_2qmeb

9962331,0,t3_5i7nwm,I think Platinum is a great game. There was alot of content added to make it a fuller experience. Things about th gen which I enjoyed feature wise is the Apps. Alot were super convienient ingame you could change the color of the backlight to make it a bit more personalized and in  I didnt have a crazy smartphone so alot of the smaller real world applications I enjoyed. I still use the counter in platinum for counting srs when shiny hunting. You could customize pokeballs to play a little animation when pokemon came out of their pokeball. Niche little feature but I enjoyed getting all the Unown so I could spell out immature stuff. HahaThe underground was super fun especially if you got just  or  people to run around with you using traps and collecting stupid treasure was a great way to kill an hour or two.The pokeradar in th gen is incredibly easy and worth using if you like shiny pokemon. I got at least  shiny pokemon with  hours clocked in.The pokemon are hit or miss. I dont really like most of the preevos and new evolutions from previous generations. However I did enjoy and still enjoy the original pokemon introduced. Rampardos Lucario Garchomp drifblim staraptor luxray spiritomb drapion and rotom. I also really enjoyed the legendaries aside from the trio.A decent amount of postgame content in platinum the music is great but is recycled a couple of times in some areas and thats never a good idea unless its route music. The aesthetic of the game is lacking IMO the camera angle and how much is fit on screen doesnt do the game justice I think a remake will definitely help it.Its all up to preference honestly. Ive at least liked one game from every generation so I may be biased but hopefully I gave a little insight on how it can be enjoyed now.,pokemon,db648x9,9,t5_2qmeb

9969211,0,t3_5ibpbr,Honestly if nostalgia cant carry you through the old games then dont bother. I can enjoy some of the old ones but not all of them.Ive been working through Yellow from the eShop on my DS because I only had Blue as a kid and its different enough that its been fun. I kind of enjoy the more primitive mechanics in RBY it makes things different. Little things like not being able to register items having to go into the menu to use an HM rather than just pressing A by the water and no EXP bar are a little annoying but I can put up with it. I still love Kanto and just enjoy experiencing the story and aesthetic of the original games. Maybe Im just a masochist but its fun.I dont play original gen  at all anymore because HGSS are so damn good. Plus my original Silver and Crystal cartridges have dead internal batteries and the daynight thing doesnt really work on an emulator. I still enjoy all the GBA games as they had my favorite visual style and I kind of like playing without the physicalspecial split at times. Leafgreen is probably my most played Pokemon game as it gives me the nostalgia factor of the originals with the convenience and visual improvement of the slightly newer games. Hoenn and Kanto are my two favorite regions which helps.I dont have Platinum but I absolutely dont play DiamondPearl anymore. Theyre kind of slow they have too many useless HMs as you say Rock Climb... the Pokemon selection is poor and I dont love or really remember the region much besides the snowy routescity. SS is the only gen  game I play.Honestly havent had the urge to play Black again after the first time through the linearity was kind of boring. I guess I should check out Black  at some point...I also lack the urge to replay X though I really enjoyed going through it. Maybe its still too fresh in my mind.I have yet to pick up SunMoon though so maybe the improvements will change my affinity for the older games.,pokemon,db70jge,0,t5_2qmeb
9969611,0,t3_5ic536,If Ash is going to win any League it should probably be Kanto and only for a season finale. Its going to be hard for Ash to win any other league outside of his home region since there is a lot of significance in Kanto that could be wasted if he won in any other leagues outside. If Ash is going to win a league then they would need a justification for him to continue the series instead of staying at the region and challenging the Elite Four and even then they would probably be around the end of the anime where they have all of his previous rivals show up for some grand tournament with Ash using his best pokemons from all of his travels.He is not going to win Alola Im making bets that it would either be Ryuki or Gladion that screws him out.,pokemon,db72f5s,6,t5_2qmeb

In the Critical Hits section you could mention something about this all stat stage modifiers the halved Attack from burn and the defensive boosts from Light Screen and Reflect are ignored if the targets defending stat stage Defense or Special Defense is greater than or equal to the attackers attacking stat stage Attack or Special Attack. taken from BulbapediaHyper training is also a special thing you could menton as the stats dont work while breeding but it does in combat as far as I understood it.ampnbspOther than this amazing guide. ,pokemon,db946ht,5,t5_2qmeb

While I can understand the appeal of having an affinity for certain types it feels weird to group them like that.  Also Rangers specialize in Grass types ingame.Theres little sense in adding all the regions either what do you really have to gain from visiting Kanto after going to Kalos or Alola?

Since its the first show that came to mind though Ill try coming up with a team for Takashi Natsume from Natsumes Book of Friends. Tries to think of the most traditional Japaneseish PokemonTrevenant  I can see this Pokemon not being too out of place in the world of Natsume.Froslass  This Pokemon seems inspired by Japanese folklore which suits the traditional Japanese feeling of Natsume.Zorua  Illusions are also something I associate with Natsume.Oricorio  Mainly for the Japanesefeel some of the forms have.Cubone  Both Natsume and Cubone carry something that reminds them of a deceased relative though for Cubone it brings sadness while for Natsume it just brings curiosity and tasks his grandmother couldnt finishFennekin  Reminds me of that kitsune friend Natsume made.

10049469,0,t3_5jepxa,The post game is better than in RBY FRLG and XY at the very least. Theres still half of the fourth island to explore the UB missions and the secrets that are hidden in one or two areas.If youre interested in breeding be it for shinies competitively or both then post game is not an issue in the slightest. Im almost at  hours in my game and still havent messed around with leveling up a competitive team only did enough Battle Royals for Destiny Knot and the EV training items. Also I havent even done the first UB mission. The only sad thing about post game is the fact that you only get one Lucky Egg in the entire game which sucks because items wont transfer from XYORAS to SuMo.The game doesnt offer a ton but theres still a lot to do. The amount of time the game takes when youre not rushing is also longer than XY and ORAS. It took around  for me to finish X and a little over  for AS. I had my first E win in Moon after  hours. I dont think I went through the game too slowly but I definitely wasnt rushing. I talked to NPCs got all the TMs as I went through the game collected all the Zygarde cells and cores etc. Also there werent hours devoted to grinding so I can beat a gym or E.TLDR Theres not a ton of postgame quests and there isnt a big area to unlock but there is postgame content. The main story also takes considerably longer than the Generation  games.,pokemon,dbhgz9l,1,t5_2qmeb

Also their lack of a proper new Metroid game makes me greatly disappointed.

10056846,0,t1_dbczx1i,I was already  chapters deep when you replied and now Im on chapter . It truly is a good read. The rational interpretation of the pokemon world is great imo I was half expecting her to do away with  type advantages entirely really happy she found a way to explain them. Like when someone says Why should a fighting types kick hurt this umbreon anymore than a boulder or a charging taurous? But then the response is But it does do more damage and we dont know why yet which is great set up for the future as well. Personally I think the extra chapters are a little boring RedBlueLeaf are far more interesting charactersstorylines than whatever the hell reds mom is doing lol. One major criticism I have  is the age and while I see it addressed in the FAQs I feel like its a major oversight to keep these kids so young. For one the characters sound like  year olds theres no reason to think theyre younger than that other than her saying it outright. She addresses that by saying well theyre just above average  year olds!.... But if these are above average  year olds and they almost die  or  times within their first few days of travelling how the hell do you think a normal  year olds going to last? They would be dying left and right theres no way sending them out that early would be such common practice especially in a rational world. ,pokemon,dbifjm5,1,t5_2qmeb

If anything this method keeps gaining a few more minutes each box.  minutes on the first box.   minutes on the second  on the third. So  minutes saved after  eggs. And youd keep saving.

10089160,0,t1_dbmltuy,If youre talking about EV training there are a few methods.Your Pokmon can have up to  EVs in a stat and  EVs in total. At level   EVs are roughly equivalent to  stat point.You can KO Pokmon to get EVs from them. Each Pokmon has a different number of EVs associated with it  I.E. Jolteon yields  speed EVs and Alomomola yields  HP EVs. If you want to EV train through KOing Pokmon you could use the SoS chaining method where each new Pokmon called in gives double the amount of EVs.Or if youre willing to wait you could use Pok Pelagos Isle Evelup. At rank  this island will give  EVs to a Pokmon per session.  sessions equals  EVs. It takes a while but is a surefire way to get exactly what you need.,pokemon,dbmmuqw,1,t5_2qmeb

10099469,0,t1_dbnxkve,MegaSalamence hits like a truck with its aerilate ability and doubleedge meaning that it can usually OHKO anything that isnt super bulky. Xurkitree has pretty good type coverage making it a solid lead sweeper with very high special attack and decent speed. Pheromosa is very fast with a nice special attack stat so it can finish off low health targets rather easily. Also remember that the Ultra Beasts have a unique ability that boosts their highest stat by one stage if they knockout an opponent. So each time Xurkitree or Pheromosa finish off an opponent they get a boost to their special attack making it easier to OHKO each of the opponents Pokmon as they come out.,pokemon,dbnz3lx,3,t5_2qmeb

10114541,0,t3_5kpznw,Since this is an ingame team I wouldnt recommend either.Charjabug doesnt evolve until nearly the very end of the game. Its just a huge dead weight until then and even when it does evolve its slow as dirt. Itll get worn down by random trainers and the E because it will often have to take a hit before it gets to attack. Magnemite makes for a superior Electric Pokmon choice. Better typing more power and Eviolite Magneton is a tough nut to crack. If you are slower than anything its Analytical ability will make sure your opponent gets wrecked for it.Scolipede lacks Speed Boost and ingame youll rarely ever find yourself in need of a Bug or Poison type attack to hit for Super Effective damage. Bug only hits Psychic and Dark but you wont see those types that often especially Psychic. Poison only hits Grass and Fairy but Fire Ice and Flying cover Grass easily and youll have all three of those attacks available regardless of the starter you pick. Fairy types are uncommon among NPC trainers.Are you just looking for a Bug type Pokmon in general because the options arent that great until post game. After that Mega Pinsir Buzzwole and Scizor are all awesome.,pokemon,dbpxlrs,2,t5_2qmeb

10126289,0,t3_5ky2ya,Although I typically agree that trainers you encounter should have more Pokemon this game didnt really highlight the need for it because of the improved AI in battles. Even with  Pokemon a lot of the trainers gave me a hard time because theyve gotten smarter and the game was built so that my full team of six was never truly overleveled for any of the trainers or challenges I had to face.As for the trials Ill have to disagree. Quite a few of them were actually challenging which is not something I can say for XY or ORAS at all. A lot of people seemed to have had trouble with Lurantis which didnt really give me any issue because of my Litten but Wishiwashi Mimikyu and Kommoo gave me quite a bit of trouble.Ill definitely agree that the postgame was a bit lackluster and that Team Skull was awesome though. Im currently trying to complete my Pokedex by catching them all not by simply asking for a lot of them by trade and its a grind. I get that they wanted some Pokemon to be really hard to come by but its killing my desire to complete my Pokedex now.

Dont follow?Relicanth in Black learns Headsmash at level  and shares its leveling rate with such legends as actual legendary pokmon and Volbeat. Which meant I was raising a pokmon with a slow leveling rate that isnt super great at battling to level  as I explored the region with the fucked up exp system of pokmon Black and low level cap of opponents outside of the Elite  round  that I couldnt feasibly train against.The satisfaction?

Ill be disinterested in the culture in the area think about how this place doesnt look modern and would mainly ask to go to the much more modernish city to do my shopping there.  Also I would keep modern appliances in my home where everything else doesnt look modern. Now if I were to choose where Id live I think Id be at Lumiose City. It has about everything I want I feel.

Considering people hyped themselves up for Pokemon Gray and moreso with Pokemon Z only for neither to come out Im willing to believe whats in front of me. Whats in front of me is they just released Sun and Moon. Are they really going to release Stars and take away sales from a game thats only been out not even a year? Yes its very possible but realistically? Most likely not at least concerning this year.  One thing I will mention too is there is no telling what is and what is not in development and theres no reason to speculate on things.  For me I look at it like this has there been a true major release for Pokemon on a home console since I want to say Pokemon Battle Revolution for the mainstream games? No. Has the crowd been  for sequels and speculating? Yes. Hence Im willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.,pokemon,dc8prgh,6,t5_2qmeb

I found that water route near Route  and eventually came across a shack that had a Pokmon Ranger. After I was given the egg I just kept biking in circles I looked up how eggs hatched. Since it was the Larvesta egg it took a hella long time to hatch but when it did hatch it... the DS said the game was ejected...I was pretty pissed so I retraced my steps and hatched that sucker. While I did get a peak at Larvesta earlier seeing it after the DS screwed up just made it seem like a really lame Pokmon being level one didnt help its case. So I grind and grind... eventually getting to the point of evolution... my mind was blown when it finally felt like evolving and Volcarona was definitely a reward well worth the effort.Then I found that Volcarona in the basement of Relic Castle... still love that Volcarona that I put a lot of effort in raising though.,pokemon,dc9xdmb,13,t5_2qmeb

Like maybe someone will give some recycled argument about how they dont like the gen  roster and use Garbodor or Klinklang as an example. Ive seen people blow up at that but then immediately say You think those designs are shitty? No gen  is! A Pokeball with eyes a pile of eggs a pile of shit with a face!

In Moon I have Decidueye Lunala Goodra Salazzle Poliwrath and Mudsdale.When replaying a game I sometimes plan my team beforehand and use Pokemon that I feel like are appropriate whether it storywise or whatever.  For example in Leafgreen I used Charizard Pikachu Lapras Snorlax Hitmonlee and Aerodactyl.

10365982,0,t1_dcj1k5p,According to another commenter yes it appears Bank is the issue. So you should still be able to evolve it if you transfer it back to X and evolve it there and then bring it back.From bulbapedia If a Pokmon that can evolve by friendship is transferred to a different game using Pokmon Bank it will be blocked from being able to evolve through friendship. This does not apply to Pokmon transferred using the Pok Transporter. If that Pokmon has an evolution that does not require friendship such as a Sewaddle into a Swadloon then it will still be able to evolve but it will be unable to evolve through friendship. The Pokmon will be able to evolve through friendship again should it be transferred back to its Original Trainer through Pokmon Bank and will be prevented again should the Pokmon be transferred using Pokmon Bank again. Additionally the Pokmon will be able to evolve through friendship if traded between games.,pokemon,dcj1o9y,4,t5_2qmeb

Hell raikou doesnt have much of a following at all.id hesitate to call Hooh lugia and celebi a trio. i like lugia and hooh a lot i just like The hoenn trio A LOT MORE. besides does any one actually know what makes Lugia so legendary. like what is the deal with lugia celebi travels through time and Hooh can bring things back from the dead but lugia just seems like a rare animal.The Hoenn trio are well designed and each treated pretty equally. i love the lore behind them as well.my problem with the creation trio is that they seem kind of weak for they are beings who control the fabric of reality shouldnt be able to be beaten by anything.As much as i love Unova i will be the first to admit the Tao trio are too Yugioh for my liking. XERNEAS and friends could be cool but i think they are bit over simplified. If it was a cloak and dagger situation where one is overflowing with life energy and the other requires to drain it from other things in order to survive that would have been cool. if we count zygarde as its own trio then it wins for Zydoggo aloneI do like nebby i just cant seem to muster up the energy to care about Necrozma,pokemon,dckfsom,37,t5_2qmeb

Circuitry can be fitted into the cartridge itself to make a GB internal Flash work even with a byteoriented bit architecture as the all that have to be present when XIP is code and Pokedex both being fairly small while map data and models can be paged in and out freely.As of Sun and Moon the new game can come with a small tool that can copy assets and save data from the players Sun and Moon cartridge into the onboard storage effectively converting it into an online downloaded version.

So if a trainer used Featherdance on me and I leveled up I freaked out because I thought it would lower my Attack stat permanently. I would always try to have Swoobat use Calm Mind a lot before leveling up... Also to be fair the vitamins STILL say that they increase base stats which is a FLAT OUT LIE. Seriously no they dont. Base stats are like Incineroar having higher base attack as a species than Primariana the base stats they are talking about are actually EVs! Makes me SO MAD.,pokemon,dctace4,7,t5_2qmeb

10544998,0,t3_5ndom4,I dont know. Guzma comes off as edgyfashioned Cyrus Light to me. Dont get me wrong though hes a massive improvement over the previous team leaders. But hes not quite on Giovannis level.I actually have a fantasy that Giovanni is secretly behind all the other teams. He just finds a severely psychotic person to act as the firgurehead of his criminal operations when he gets to a new area and only operates behind the scenes. Johto was about him having left the KantoJohto area. In Hoenn he showed up to get Deoxys while everyone else was hunting Groudon Kyogre or Rayquaza. In Sinnoh he captured Arceus while the team distracted people around Dialga Palkia and Giratina. In Unova he was creating another synthetic pokemon Genesect while the Plasma distracted people with the struggle for ZekromReshiram and Kyurem. In Kalos he wanted to use the device as a power generator but Lysandre went rogue and tried destroy the world. In Alola he was trying to recreate Arceus due to his actual Arceus either escaping his initial attempt to capture it or being freed by Mewtwo and Rayquaza somewhere between Sinnoh and Alola.Then by the time we return to Kanto Giovanni will have acquired Mewtwo Deoxys Darkrai Genesect Hoopa and have the third Type NullSylvally or Arceus as his final team as the final boss of the game.,pokemon,dd3e5w4,1,t5_2qmeb

10591750,0,t1_dd8e42j,As much as I like Venusaur Im inclined to agree. My Venusaur in Yellow version was as good as it was because I was able to exploit the stacking damage counters between Toxic and Leech Seed. Other than that its moveset isnt fantastic though that can be said for a lot of Pokemon in the original games. I think Venusaur only holds its own as well as it does because of its bulk. If it were more like a sweeper it probably would fare even worse since it couldt take a hit.,pokemon,dd8ggzs,2,t5_2qmeb

Those usually are barely part of the community and leave when they reach their s thats why genwunners were so annoying back in  but now are mostly gone at least I havent seen any since many years they were at their  back then and now theyre adults so they leave as they cant stay online raging at a game they never palyed all the time. Same will happen with toxic haters that came later and grew with later gens theyll leave while people like us will stick around people who just like pokeman independent of which gen was around when we started. You may noticed how everybody was obssesed with gen  until this year while hating on  but now Im noticing more and more people coming foward on how they loved  and  its a cycle that goes on.A few years from now expect a bunch of people raging at Gen  saying that gen  cant compare that gen  was the best gen ever and that gen  should get a remake already.,pokemon,ddbmmhe,8,t5_2qmeb

10627760,0,t3_5rwlpk,Some things to note that may or may not have already been said In the part with Blastoise you mention that its Special Attack stat is superior to its Attack stat or at least heavily suggested at based off the previous Garchomp example. I dont really think that base  vs base  is really that significant but Blastoise does have a better special movepool which is why Blastoise uses its Special Attack. Shortly after that where you mention moves it learns I think it would be better to say They both have the same base power versus They both deal the same amount of damage especially since you follow up with how they dont deal the same amount of damage. Maybe add Psystrike and Secret Sword to the part where you mention Psyshock or maybe not since theyre on one LegendaryMythical Pokemon Your starter will have better IVs than a Pokemon caught in the wild is not necessarily true as a starter will have its IVs generated in the same manner as a wild Pokemon. If you breed a Pokemon through a Ditto or a Pokemon of the same egg group its going to have better IVs than one obtained in the wild is also not necessarily true as it mostly depends on the IVs of the Ditto or Pokemon you are breeding. Get rid of the text between the picture of the Destiny Knot and Power Bracer as its not necessarily accurate and the description of the Power items right after is better  Speaking of Power items thats what theyre called not Bracer items as you say in that part. After defeating the Caterpie with both an EVenhancing item AND Pokerus it will grant you two  HP EVs and  attack EVs is only true if holding the Power Bracer not EVenhancing items in general. In the breeding section some of the numbers are wrong. Females have an  chance of passing down whatever ability they have regardless of whether its breeding with a compatible male Pokemon or Ditto not  like it says in the picture. Also males have a  chance of passing down a Hidden Ability when breeding with Ditto not . You never really mention where to get any of the items you mention in this guide. Where do I get EV reducing berries? Pokerus? Power Items? Destiny Knot? etc.Sorry if this seems too nitpicky,pokemon,ddc682n,3,t5_2qmeb

And thats simply because a proper online service is an expensive thing to maintain. And they cant really rely on a free online experience any more because it doesnt give them the space to do all the things they want to do.

10853375,0,t1_ddzerx4,gt What about Kanto?The fact that theyre comparable is the problem. SuMo has a ridiculous pool of resources to pull from while Kanto gets a benefit of the doubt for trailblazing. The result will always be skewed by expectation. gt Actually we kind of would. If theres things pouring out of portals for seemingly no reason youd atleast need to investigate it. Hell we didnt really need to go to the Distortion World at all. We could have ignored Team Galactic and Cyrus would still be pulled through the portal and the story really wouldnt changeNot so. Unfortunately the portals didnt need that much investigation. When the UBs popped out you would fight the UBs but as we saw the characters had no motivation to go dallying around their origin. gt First of all its existed for seemingly a few days probably not even long enough for any trainers to travel up there. Second Vast Poni Canyon was essentially Victory RoadThen dont present it as victory road. Its a simple fix. Have the player take an elevator up and revisit the mountain as post game. Problem solved. gt  of Kanto is straight lines with out of place things like a picket fence maze for no reason. Kanto also has literally no variety in landscapes whatsoeverLay off Kanto sheesh. Again same argument as before you cant begin to compare the two designs directly because your result is guaranteed to be skewed.

10883610,0,t3_5vjc8q,TLDR I nerd out over the expansive possibilities and upgrades this type of game could bring to the Pokemon world including playercontrolled real time Pokemon battles a world that encourages travel and exploration a monthly realworld regional Pokemon League an annual Pokemon World Championship contests careers legendary quests and replayable stories with an opportunity for coop with friends.If done correctly yeah. My worry is that it would get bogged down by a tryhard story about some sort of worldending threat when in reality I think an open world Pokemon game would really benefit from a relaxed story  something similar to what we got in RBY or GSC where the focus is more on your journey as a trainer and less about being the absolute best so you can save the world despite only being  yearsold or whatever. I think it could be pretty cool though particularly if the battles were done in realtime as opposed to a turnbased system and if the player got full control of the Pokemons movements during the battle and each move assigned to a button with the stick for directional control and a button to jump and evade. The biggest issue would be figuring out how to accommodate for battles that occur without question in the main series games but would have obvious barriers to implementation in this kind of gameset up such as using a fish Pokemon out of water in a battle with something on land in an area that doesnt have a stream or pond or whatever for you to use. I guess one workaround for this would be implementing a set of rules that dictate when the player can use certain types of Pokemon for battles encountered in the wild. For instance in your party you have a Charmander a Rattata and a Goldeen. You encounter another wild Charmander and obviously want to use your Goldeen so you go to select it from your bagbeltother accessory but when you select it the game realizes that you arent near a body of water and therefore cannot properly use Goldeen so in a Professor Oakish way a promptwarning appears to let you know that if chosen Goldeen will be ineffectiveunusable in this battle without a body of water. At least that way kids can still tinker around and find out what is going to work where through trial and error.The rest of the game would likely use the same concepts from the main series games but since it is open world I think it would really benefit from some upgrades. Since the player would effectively now have the choice of where to go and when since there would no longer be distinct routes to take the majority of the Pokemon throughout the basic routes of the world would likely be lowleveled so as to not block the player from going wherever they would like. Players can venture off the beaten path but at their own risk as the further you travel from the main roads the more likely you are to stumble upon higherleveled but more rare Pokemon.Along this same vein because there would no longer be a distinct order in which to complete the gym badges or trials or whatever it is this region has each gym member would need to be outfitted with a variety of team options to take on a trainer of any skill level similar to what is shown in the Pokemon Origins special. For the sake of keeping the game under control in terms of size there would still be a relatively small distinct number of main challenges to face gyms whatever but the player can choose who they go up against first second etc. After completing these challenges the player would then qualify for what I assume would be a Pokemon League final challenge. Unlike the main games this could be more similar to how it is in the anime with qualified trainers randomly paired against one another until a battle between the final two decides the reigning Champion. If they wanted to make this feature even cooler in my opinion they would give it a realworld regional spin. Every two weeks or whenever qualified trainers must go to a Pokemon Center and register for the event where they are joined into a bracket with all other realworld qualified players from their realworld region. The League is then played out over the course of a night weekend whatever with each player pairing off against an opponent and either winning or losing until the final two trainers from the realworld region battle to decide who will be the Champion until the next League is held. This reigning Champion would then be disqualified from joining the next League but would instead be challenged by the next top trainer from their region at which point they will either lose and join the pool of players for the next League or they will win again and remain the Champion until the next League again. In this way you would give all qualified players a chance to become the Champion pretty frequently while also giving the Champion a chance to maintain their title and feel theyve won something worthwhile as opposed to the main series games where you win the League and then fairly little to maintain that title. As an extension of the League they could hold a Pokemon World Championship annually to decide who the best trainer in the world is for that year or month or whatever  but held less frequently than the regional League. Players qualify for this championship by achieving X number of regional League wins maybe just one since the League could potentially only be held once or twice a month and you dont want the playerbase for this championship to be too small. This would follow the same path as the regional League with the winning trainer acquiring the title until the next Pokemon World Championship is held at which point they have to defend the title and either win or lose.To keep people busy the game could feature plenty to do outside of training and catching Pokemon. You could become a certified breeder work on or own a ranch and sell eggs to individuals looking for specific rare Pokemon or people interested in paying for Pokemon that have good genes IVs. If they brought a higher level of complexity to the regional variantshiny concept you could also have people who breed specifically for interesting coat colorspatterns etc. I would say there could be an analogous Pokemon Contest events to take part in but I honestly dont know much about Contests as I never really did them myself but I imagine it would likely follow the same idea as the Leagues. Instead of battling you would choreograph a dance and design costumes? Im really not sure. Aside from that Im sure they could come up with other careers for people to pursue if they want to. I could see some trainers getting into crafting goods with their Pokemon to sell on the market like foods and such to use in battle or decorations to use in a home if you buy one. And if none of that is particularly enticing there could be quests to seek out the legendary Pokemon of the region. I imagine it would be kind of like asking the innkeeps of Skyrim for rumors to get local quests for the area. You walk into a Pokemon Center and ask a Nurse Joy if she has heard any interesting news around lately and she drops a few little hints about something mysterious happening over in them there mountains at which point you start trying to find more information about whats going on which leads to a quest to find out what strange Pokemon is out there. And for replayability there could even be dungeons or something equivalent to it that you can replay as often as youd like maybe even in a small party of others with their Pokemon. This could be stuff like teaming up to stop a rampaging Pokemon from destroying a forest or sneaking into a crime syndicates secret base to face their boss and put an end to their operations. An open world Pokemon game would already have enough play value packed into it as is but why not push the envelope a little bit?I didnt really read the article so if all of this was touched on Im sorry lol. Im just super bored at work and liked thinking about it all.,pokemon,de2kf6z,5,t5_2qmeb

10895316,0,t3_5vmrrm,I dont know if this qualifies as younger but I started watching Pokemon during Gen  specifically Galactic Battles and I personally really enjoyed that series. However it was a few years before I saw the original Indigo LeagueOrange Island series. When I first discovered it it was on the Pokemon website and I kinda laughed at how old  it looked. However as I actually watched the episdoes I started to really really enjoy the original series to the point that it has become my favorite.Ive watched a little of each season since then some more then others but the original is still my favorite. Quickly summarized my thoughts on each Gen are Gen  GREAT Gen  GOOD Gen . GOODish I miss Misty Gen PRETTY GREAT  Gen  I    Gen  Well at least its not  and Gen  Ill be honest I couldnt force myself to watch itAdditionally I dont think my affection Gen  can be excused through nostalgia as I didnt actually watch the original show when I was younger.Interested in your guys thoughts! ,pokemon,de3rw4t,1,t5_2qmeb

Smarter Cubones would mourn their mother while safe in a little cave somewhere The dex entries also say that Sandiles favorite prey is Trapinch one of my favorite pokemon despite them being the exact same size and weight and Trapinch being an ambush predator and having a bite force that can cleave through boulders.

Youre always going to have controversial decisions but in one setup nobody gets blamed and people just deal with it. In the other someone gets flamed and attacked and nobody wants to be the focus of that garbage.I dont see any upside to your suggestion. You yourself said that there will always be bias and backlash so why should one personone group be the target? Its pointless. Just let the community choose for themselves.

11061328,0,t1_deklres,gt I even tried to do a solo run with itThats your problem. You cant always do a solo run with any one Pokemon and expect to win no matter how overleveled you are. Of course it kept dying to Grasstypes  It has a x weakness and its a tank not a sweeper.This would be roughly equivalent to using a Ferrothorn on a solo run.With Darmanitan you have the makings of a monstrous sweeper with paper thin defenses. Once you overlevel it it wont take any hits and just clears the field due to its high speed and power. With Seismitoad youre supposed to slowly stall out your opponent when you take hits neutrally. That x Grass weakness is why you use something else and not just one slow tank to clear the entire field.Look at these terrible defenses for Darmanitan but good Speed and Attack.Look at the well rounded stats for the slow Seismitoad,pokemon,dels7wa,6,t5_2qmeb

For example take EvoCreo. The creator a fan of Pokemon wanted to try his hand at improving the core formula. He made the game because hes a fan of Pokemon yet doesnt use their content! Everything is original  The monsters the sprites the name etc. Or all of the Fnaf fangames Like Popgoes and Five Nights at Candys.

11260630,0,t1_df6wng9,tldr My guess is memory optimisation. This may be complete rubbish so I welcome corrections.This is purely speculative. I am not IT.Could be in the way that numbers work when stored in a computer. If we reduce everything down to binary representation then  would be written as a ninebit integer . The maximum value of a ninebit integer is  . The least significant bit LSB the last digit may be used to store some other information that the computer needs when using the number.  is the old maximum EV value of a single stat and coincidentally is also the largest number which can be stored as an eightbit integer . Since a point is added to a stat for every four EVs at level  the maximum number of useful EVs which can be stored in an eightbit integer i.e. the larges bit number divisible by  is    in binary. This leaves us with two unused bits on the right. So maxing out EVs in two stats is      in binary which leaves us with three extra bits. One of those bits the LSB we need for other reasons which leaves us with  bits left over. In the number XYZ where Z is the LSB and X and Y are the two spare bits. Taking XYZ we can convert from binary to decimal   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt.Excluding the last case  this gives us seven extra numbers including  the extra EVs left over from changing the cap from gt. And we can still use the LSB for whatever its original purpose was. As to why not just scrap those extra  EVs the amount of space taken up by the ninebit integer is  bits regardless of whether all the bits are used for something so I guess you may as well use them? As for raising the cap to   in binary it would require  bits to store the EVs remember the maxium bit integer is . One extra bit here and there isnt much but it all adds up. At that point you may as well rework the entire EV system.,pokemon,df8djc1,2,t5_2qmeb

However I always wanted to play with the pokemons I knew from Gen . Therefore Im about to purchase Pokemon FireRed and I need a system to run it on. I am considering purchasing the Game Boy Advance SP Zelda Edition. I think it looks really good and it seems like I can get a reasonable price for one.

11566241,0,t3_64yqyn,Fucking Zigzagoon. Playing Hoenn is not fun anymore for me because theres nothing but Zigzagoon. Im quite confident that on literally everywhere with grass there is some way to find Zigzagoon or a Linoone. Instead of diversity theres Zigzagoon. Kindly fuck off Zigzagoon.So my catharsis is Pokemon battles where I can viciously fight and enjoy victory with my team. Except everyone in Hoenn has a Zigzagoon too. I walk into a route and theres a bunch of  year old punks with Zigzagoons. I crush them beneath my feet and steal their experience but it isnt the same. Zigzagoon isnt a threat anymore. It isnt something that can be conquered. Killing Zigzagoon is like dusting you do it to get it over with because if you dont theyll suffocate you. Hoenn is no doubt environmentally suffering because of Zigzagoon. I adamantly believe that Team Aqua was in the right were there no more land there would be more Zigzagoon. Team Magma is the total enemy for this exact same reason they would endorse the end of the world to Zigzagoons as we know it. Of course Zigzagoon learns Thunderbolt so they can handle Aqua just fine and they have Surf for Team Magma. Still I suggest that we have a moment of silence to pray for the poor Hoennites. Surely they must be reaching peak insanity as a result of this dangerous invasive nuisance. ,pokemon,dg71ek9,3,t5_2qmeb

Could still be crippling to walls and be used to setup in doubles however it wouldnt be so devastating for special sweepers.

11699606,0,t3_66wm2n,This is pretty cool Im glad I keep track of all my Pokmon in a giant spreadsheet for stuff like this.Kinda sucks that outofregion Pokmon are excluded since I love finding loopholes like Dream Radar DexNav and Island Scan to get National Dex Pokmon before the Elite Four. The only time Ive used Trevenant ingame was in Alpha Sapphire for example.Also even though Ive only got two runs under my belt my Kalos data is super bloated due to a stupid idea I had where I would catch and train one thing from almost every area in the game.

11701937,0,t3_66sy8h,Meganium is by far one of the coolest pokmon based off a real animal dinosaur.  Plus Bayleef looks awesome.  I can tell the creators put a lot of time into Emboars design and especially shiny variation.  I just feel bad that it turned out like it did.  But its shiny is in my top  maybe even .  Chespin sucks and so does his evolution.  Chesnaught how ever looks amazing as a whole and is super cool.  He may not have the best stats or move set but his design is wicked.Primarina has cool moves and my favorite Z move starter animation.  But as a whole.....you know....Incinerator is a beast I picked him in moon.  Hes wicked on the field but his design is just wayyyy to human.  I also like his Z move to a extent but it gets old.  ,pokemon,dgmflxm,2,t5_2qmeb

The Sims had so much more mass appeal and got non gamer types interested in and more accepting of gaming. Honestly the first Sims was one of theain games that started pushing the gaming hobby way more mainstream. Also it was a goddamn masterpiece. ,pokemon,dgt910w,0,t5_2qmeb
