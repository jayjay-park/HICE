8043232,0,t1_d4k4fj9,Yeah the range mod is what scares me! It would be nice to add the hubsan module for my X,TinyWhoop,d4k4vmg,1,t5_3enmu
8801322,0,t3_4uac2b,I bought  of these and they ran great for  weeks. Now  are dead and the other  barely have enough juice for a minute flight and the whoop acts erratically with them. It might be due to using the stock inductrix usb charger?  I just bought the  pack with parralel charger so hopefully that extends the life? I have  and  cell batterys that work fine after years. Are  cells just not very durable? Cant keep dropping cash on batteries every month.,TinyWhoop,d75ss8u,1,t5_3enmu
9444873,0,t1_d9cp4h5,Heres some pics. I took off camera and its still very weak then I replaced the battery lead with the one I cut from the camera but didnt change performance. Before that I even tried the thicker gauge lead you get from TW but it had a short and melted at the connector... Fortunately beebrain seems fine. ,TinyWhoop,d9d7dld,1,t5_3enmu

9824961,0,t3_5fz1cd,You might want to look into getting a different FC for the inductrix. You could get one that supports the Flysky protocol like the beecore which will work with the x. The beecore runs betaflight so you can also fly in acro or airmode and it is only a little more expensive than the orangerx module.,TinyWhoop,dao7oin,1,t5_3enmu

10280676,0,t1_dc9cnv5,Alright i disconnected the camera and nothing has changed... im thinking i maybed the motors got damaged because i installed new props as well that were much tighter and i had to use pliers just to get them back off again. Would pulling on the shaft of the motors too much cause them any damage?,TinyWhoop,dc9dd59,1,t5_3enmu
10369543,0,t1_dcjfqfo,Regular.But upon some testing the new charger gives connection break on every mode.Same with my fatshark dominator battery. Hmm faulty?,TinyWhoop,dcjg758,1,t5_3enmu
10540773,0,t3_5qx9st,What kind of flight controller are you using?  It might help assess what your limitations are.  Usually with most tiny whoops that can go Acro it would have an FC like the Beebrain or the Acrowhoop and thus youd have to set up all your switches from within a USB port. ,TinyWhoop,dd2www9,1,t5_3enmu

10802450,0,t1_ddsxw02,Excellent! Maybe Ill grab a set or two.  The more I fly the blademod the more it feels slushy in response.,TinyWhoop,ddu72wc,1,t5_3enmu

10927762,0,t1_de6mefj, Those D ratings are higher than any ive seen but yours seem to have great aero. Did you notice any changes upgrading to ..? ,TinyWhoop,de74ej3,1,t5_3enmu

11258763,0,t1_df7v01f,Hey Tony.Great idea I may try that next time.  I just did a half bend and put a bit of hot glue at the base where the solder joint is.  Hopefully it helps if not I may try this method a future replacement lol.,TinyWhoop,df85wu6,2,t5_3enmu
11291191,0,t1_dfb3vck,The batteries arent that hard to solder compared to a lot of thing we have to do in this hobby but if you need batteries anyway you could get some that already come with the connector like these They even come with the female connector on a pigtail so its easier to solder than the pins like I did in the video.  Mine just arrived in the mail today so Im really curious to see how they compare with the ones I just made.,TinyWhoop,dfbu99m,2,t5_3enmu
11376405,0,t3_60zirf,Thank you for the detailed explanation! Will probably print something similar in TPU for mine this is really helpful. Might look into depron in the future seems to be a great material. ,TinyWhoop,dflhv3l,1,t5_3enmu
