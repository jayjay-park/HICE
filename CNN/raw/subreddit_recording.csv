1185518,0,t3_27mzhc,first of playing audio on your speakers while recording with a condenser mic wont work. secondly I would always go for the Rode Nta it is one of the quietest mics i have ever heard and has really good sound and build quality for its price. as for the interface i can suggest the Tascam  Mk,recording,ci2zmxu,1,t5_2r8eb
1299624,0,t1_ciftbwd,I actually havent heard about that. My friend never had any latency issues with his but the clipping seems like it could be a problem. He recorded his guitars straight into it and used amplitube but I do remember him having to dial it down and find that sweet spot but it wasnt too bad. I can imagine if youre going to record live amps with mics it might be tougher. ,recording,ciftosx,1,t5_2r8eb

3166157,0,t1_copjtxt,Wow thank you for the detailed answer!Yeah i can see why EQ alone might not work the way i would like it to... But i will definitely try reverb maybe this will help!The performance itself isnt that bad it fits the scene although i think there is something missing... Maybe i am just too critical.Oh well,recording,coq660o,1,t5_2r8eb
4852270,0,t3_3h9k6d,So a few things to realize hereA Ycable wont work. The C is a condenser which requires phantom power and I dont believe you can power two microphones from a single input.Secondly if you could plug both mics into a single input you wouldnt retain any stereo leftside rightside information. The information coming from both mics would be added together unable to be split later.,recording,cu65xvr,3,t5_2r8eb

7303403,0,t3_4a3suk,If youre an amateur artist I would definately either stick to what you have or go with the MK. Spending close to K on a mic when you dont have any cash flow is just a bad idea in my opinion.That being said depending on how often you record you can always rent a high end mic for a day or two and knock off a whole bunch of tracks in one go.,recording,d28cj4s,1,t5_2r8eb
7303440,0,t3_4ewsp8,I would go with option .You can mix the pickup signal which is clean with some of the mic signal. Also treat your room with whatever you got blankets matresses carpets etc. Also since your room sucks close mic as much as you can you only want to distance mic when in a nice room you can add reverb later.,recording,d28col1,1,t5_2r8eb

8198819,0,t1_d52ea5b,I guess I dont know what Im looking for when it comes to interfaces if it has multiple inputs and a USB connection is it safe to assume that it will allow multiple simultaneous recorded tracks? I want  xlr and at least four instrument jacks. More would be better. Also! If theres something in a rack mount format that would be a big bonus,recording,d52emex,1,t5_2r8eb
8611830,0,t1_d6dmi7m,Hey man thank you for replying.Given the expense and a friend telling me something similar to what you said Ive decided to leave MS recordingbuying another mic and instead treat the room a bit. To minimise spill Im gonna try a small condenser on the guitar and an SM on my voice since Im kinda loud and see how it pans out.For years Ive been at this recording lark and it still drives me crazy. Once I have some items recorded then yeah totally if youre cool with it I can send them to you if you want to practice mixing  it probably wont be the greatest recordings in the first place but its something to experiment with.,recording,d6i2q7p,1,t5_2r8eb
8624893,0,t3_4xzpjm,Looks like you need to open he box and replace the potentiometer.  Or you could try and glue something on the end.  You risk gluing the the thing permently at that setting though. ,recording,d6jppty,1,t5_2r8eb
9280607,0,t3_57hs06,Audio Technical sells some with built in Mics that are great but still no where near a stand alone microphone. They also sell a sportscaster style headset I think Seananners uses it. Has a fantastic microphone but Im sure audio quality is sub par. Im at work. Will try to get the names later.,recording,d8sdtsw,1,t5_2r8eb
9631281,0,t3_5cxyin,The first thing youll need is an interface. Nothing will happen without it. A lot of people start with something from the Focusrite Scarlet series. I think the AudioBox line from Presonus is just as good but it also gives you a copy of Studio One Artist for free which normally costs  USD. There are cheaper options than the two I just mentioned but they... arent great. These two are the least expensive ones that I feel good recommending to people. How many inputs and outputs depends on what kind of music you want to record and how you want to do it. For example I writerecord hard rock. Its just me doing all the parts and I use a drum plugin Superior Drummer or EZ Drummer so I never need more than  inputs. I have young kids at home so I usually just record my guitar straight into my DAW and use Bias by Positive Grid. The only time I use both inputs on my UAD Apollo Twin Duo is when Im recording an acoustic guitar sometimes I mic the neck and body separately. But I digress. If you plan on recording live drums youll want an interface with at least  or  inputs but  would be ideal. ,recording,da094n5,3,t5_2r8eb
