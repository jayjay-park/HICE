415815,0,t1_cfnv1o0,I was going to ask about that. I dont know the locals as well as you do. Whatever we can come up with would be great I am sure someones house is out of the question it is for me.,nebraskabeer,cfnv5fg,1,t5_2yb2s

1106898,0,t1_chu3n1e,I kinda just assumed the Reserve Series wouldnt be available for growler fills haha. Especially since they are available in the large bottles for ! Either way I need to make it out there!,nebraskabeer,chu413c,1,t5_2yb2s

1767289,0,t3_2ea9ey,Has anyone ever done a sidebyside with NH Dragons Milk and Weyerbacher Heresy?  Ive had them both and rank them similar but never side by side to know witch i really prefer.  Are their any other easily attainable oz BA Stouts that we should include in this mix?  ,nebraskabeer,ck1x8ao,0,t5_2yb2s
2967729,0,t1_co59158,Hey.... weeks out is close enough for me. COME ON BEER WEEK ,nebraskabeer,co5g2eu,4,t5_2yb2s
3147987,0,t1_conqkti,That surprises me. I really dont like the idea of our beer hitting a questionable growler. We assume all are dirty regardless of who brings them back and take the sanitization of the vessel seriously.,nebraskabeer,cooaaka,1,t5_2yb2s

4573493,0,t1_ct6v1wi,I cant argue that. I dont go to Upstream as much as I should. Zipline and Nebraska are both way on top of their game though though Zipline obviously isnt located in Omaha.,nebraskabeer,ct73jip,3,t5_2yb2s
4576590,0,t1_ct6rk53, Farnam House EmployeeBerliner and Kriek are both still on tap but may not last long. Kriek will not last much longer than  more weeks at this rate.,nebraskabeer,ct7hiqx,2,t5_2yb2s

5974056,0,t3_3x9a5b,Lame.  No Oktoberfest beer.  Zipline is quickly becoming my favorite brewery in Nebraska.  Pretty much neck and neck with Empyrean.  Wish theyd do an ESB though.  Such an underrated style.  ,nebraskabeer,cy2qahy,1,t5_2yb2s
5976470,0,t1_cy31ksn,I didnt get a chance to. Any darker beer that is smoked is usually pretty damn tasty though ,nebraskabeer,cy31orw,1,t5_2yb2s
