659708,0,t3_21nbfr,Nah. Peter is a werewolf. When Letha asks how hes okay his mom tells her that love is the most powerful magic. I think that in this case a lot of important shit was going down and whatever spirits or forces Peter communicated with were paying close attention. I think they spared Peter as a final gift to Letha in part because her love was pure and in part because it would balance out Letha being marked for death.My only question now is whether Peter will now be able to turn at will since he did it once.Also I think Christina is now a vampireupir. They didnt cut off her head.,HemlockGrove,cgf9bf8,4,t5_2u4x8

1447828,0,t1_cixknjh,Did it have super blue eyes in season ? Maybe it turned blue when it developed its powers? Nadia was the one giving peter and roman all of the dreams right? So Nadia knew what was going on around the area? And is prophetic? Kind of crazy powers for a toddler when you combine the instakill head squish power,HemlockGrove,cixreun,2,t5_2u4x8

2136377,0,t1_clbd5y1,With Hemlock Grove you have to watch all of the episodes in order to get everything thats going on. With Dr. Who not so much. You should definitely rewatch all of Tennants Doctor though. Just because. ,HemlockGrove,clbdpdq,3,t5_2u4x8
2149528,0,t3_2jliju,The book never had any kind of sequel so Im happy for any sort of continuation. Im really shocked that its been renewed for season  at all seen as people in general seemed not to like season  or find fault in it somehow. Hemlock is also a very niche show I half expected it to be cancelled then people realise its awesome later on like twin peaks. ,HemlockGrove,cld1ydt,5,t5_2u4x8

5941859,0,t3_3wrji5,Final thought the theme of the show was perfect for season . Mysterious gothic and disturbing. But the nature of the show changed so much after that that something more pop and upbeat like Smallville theme for example would have been more suited.,HemlockGrove,cxyiac2,4,t5_2u4x8
