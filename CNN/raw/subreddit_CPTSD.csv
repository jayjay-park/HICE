5581634,0,t3_3pizto,I think the hardest thing about having a subreddit dedicated to trauma is that any and every single thing that is said in it may be unpleasant enough to keep a number of people with PTSD away.  Come to think of it trauma has to be the hardest thing to talk about in any forum internet or otherwise.I also come to subreddits like these for information.  If peoples stories teach me something new I find them valuable.  Otherwise they are just heartbreaking stories that I empathize with but all of which I can not possibly read.  We all want to listen and comfort each other but trauma is trauma and is hard to hear about too.,CPTSD,cwoyc6a,2,t5_2vvid
5892709,0,t1_cxrh4vq,I am so sorry that you had to experience that and at such a young age   What you wrote about how just the knowledge of him dying was a form of contact is so apt and helpful I feel in a way like he and all the memories have insinuated themselves into my mind and I dont want them there.  Im angry that I get to be a victim over and over and over just with this knowledge.  The issue of contact has been raised I feel my family are confused that I still refuse to talk with him even in light of these events but I know I will personally have no regrets there were  years for him to acknowledge and accept responsibility and comments made by him about it even now which I wish I didnt know show he still doesnt.  Then that makes me upset that I am feel so cold and unforgiving.It feels that any emotion that stems from all of this is a loss for me somehow and he still wins if that makes sense?

6907584,0,t3_4a9c8i,I also have anxiety and Im a pretty damn good budgetor so heres my advice First do you have a calendar? If not I recommend one. Every month I usually do a month in advance write down all your bills due dates. Seeing everything laid out takes some of the panicky feelings away because then its easier to make a plan of action.nd make a plan of action. Write down when you get paid and assign bills to each paycheck. Even if you get paid frequently and dont NEED to assignhave a strict budget I recommend doing it anyway. For myself my anxiety peaks when unexpected big things come up in our budget. By already having an outline of where money is allocated I can easily take control of the situation. Now Im not a therapist so this is purely armchair psychology but I think your panic attacks are also stemming from a place of feeling like you dont have control. For SO long you only dealt with the finances when things were bad. Even after your divorce that financial turmoil didnt phase you because you were used to dealing with it. Now that things are mostlyare settled maybe subconsciously youre afraid. Your only experiences with finances were negative and its unsettling to not have something bad happening and it sends you into a panic. I think having a written budget and plan will help take back that feeling of control Hugs sweetie. I know it probably doesnt mean much coming from an internet stranger but I am SO proud of you for breaking free and I admire your courage. And I know the same way you were able to get away from your ex is the same way youll get away from this anxiety about finances. You can do it lt,CPTSD,d0zalh5,2,t5_2vvid

I was conditioned from childhood to believe that psychedelics were dangerous. It took a lot of research and a supportive environment to convince me they were worth a try. However it is not the psychedelic that helps alone. It must be taken with support and in a safe environment. Ideally with a trained therapist. Alternatively there is MDMA which is not a psychedelic.

Ironically I work in customer service and have been for years. I love helping customers although with certain people I can get extreme anxiety but I cant handle interactions with my coworkers and bosses. My therapist says that Im in control of the interaction with customers and they view me as an expert they can come to for help while with my peers and authority they dont need help so I have no control. Also I put on my nice friendly helpful mask for customers so Im not so afraid to talk to them.

8964519,0,t1_d7p6yy7,The negative thinking is probably very ingrained. But I dont think this is a matter of it being buried too deep. The brain is very much like a muscle. It is spectacularly adaptive. Its so adaptive that if you lost your sight tomorrow your brain would break down the neural networks for sight and rewire the neurons to use them to bolster up your hearing and your sense of smell.And you can do the same with negative thinking.You have spent your whole like thinking negative thoughts so its going to take some time and patience to build new neural pathways. I have positive affirmations and I do it all day. As Im showering as Im laying on the couch to take a nap cutting veg for dinner. Im just running that tape constantly.This is training your brain. You are thinking negative thoughts without trying without intending to its trained into your brain. Like I find myself using my turn signal because Im about to turn into a parking space in an empty lot. When I do it it strikes me how unnecessary it was to do. But I have such a strong neural pathway that associates turning my car with using my signal I do it without thought or intention. Try not to get frustrated with yourself for the negative thoughts try not to define yourself by them. This is something you had to do to survive. This habit helped you and served you well. That part of you doesnt understand that you dont need to do that any more. Its still trying to help. So let it. Let those negative thoughts be your daily reminders that you need to forge new neural networks for positive thoughts. gtand they were at a loss about it and asking me what I think would work  like how am I supposed to know?? I thought you were the experts!gtI have tried to do everything rightThere is no right. I think this idea sits at the core of a lot of our problems. If you are at all familiar with the triune brain most of us have issues with our lizard brains taking over. Our primate brains tend to be disused and underdeveloped and this part of our brain that prefrontal cortex that is what drives selfreflection. What do you think would work? Who are you? What do you need that you arent getting? How are you hiding from yourself? I went through all sorts of failed therapies as well. I was raised to believe that I have no agency I am incompetent and broken. It was when I stopped waiting for somebody else to have the answer that I really started to recover. They are not the experts in what is most important. You are supposed to be the expert in you in who you are what you need and what is really going wrong. Other people can help you and give you guidance I have had some amazing people in this role for me but you have to be driving this and that means really trying to get in touch with yourself. Trying to be accepting of yourself love yourself look with compassion at the ways you are holding yourself back to learn who you really are and what you really need.Thats easy to say I recognize that. Its not easy to do. Its the real work. The real work is figuring out what work you need to do. Look into my eyes you are the captain now.,CPTSD,d7pef45,2,t5_2vvid

I have been seeing a shrink weekly for the past year and were still trying to figure out a combo of antidepressants that can help nothing has made much of an impact    but with regards to the support groups thing... I feel like I dont really belong in a PTSD group I could be wrong because I dont get the type of flashbacks that are typically a big issue for people with that... I have emotional flashbacks but those are much different and my bigger issues are from chronic traumaemotional neglect that kind of stuff.. and from what Ive seen so far cptsd is a pretty new thing and not very established as far as support groups and cptsdspecific resources    what kind of stuff were you thinking I could do to get on a more steady footing? I totally agree but I dont really know what to do... and also feel like I might not be able to do that while living with my mom because I mean I love her but she is toxic for me to live with...

10165969,0,t3_5li107,There are many things you can try Disposable foam ear plugs. They should be fine for prolonged use and does attenuate a great deal of sound up to db. Noise isolating headphones this is if you want to block outside sound plus have some music to mask everything out. Active noise cancelling is not as useful for people sounds as it is for constant sounds such as airplane humming so mainly recommend noise isolating ones that DJs use in nightclubs. Sennheiser HD  Pro is a classic. As the other answer mentioned white noise machines or any humming home appliance fan heater etc might help. In general masking is your friend your ear literally cant hear a sound that is masked by frequencies in close neighborhood so generating your own noise is a good alternative. You can also check websites that generate whitebrownpink noise to see which one helps the most. Even in low volume they help a ton. Passive noise isolation I understand youre renting so there is not much you can do to change the structure of the building but if the noisy neighbors are not on the upper floor you have plenty options to attenuate walls for noise carpets wall to wall bookcases other furniture drapes etc.Of course all of these solutions are about eliminating triggers and ideally youd want to work with a professional on the feelings of anxiety etc to have an enduring solution.

10553321,0,t3_5quo95,My heart sank a bit when you explained she wanted to believe you and labeled you with BPD. I know firsthand how invalidating and discouraging that is to go through and I hate to see other people getting the same type of care. Your experiences are valid and like many people who suffer from CPTSD we had to a LOT of soul searching and research to get to this conclusion. I too would like for others to be on my side too and it feels so lonely when you feel you HAVE to prove your experience. I think many abusers love to throw around the word overreacting and too sensitive to shut the abused person up and deflect the blame. Im not really sure what you should do net. Maybe give them another session to see if it wasnt a fluke or mess up. Hopefully you have other options for therapists!I know some therapists just are not familiar with PTSD let alone CPTSD and a lot ignore the root causes and only tackle the symptoms. It can be really frustrating finding the right one. And sadly I heard horror stories with people diagnosed with BPD and it seems they are the most stigmatized group in the Mental Health profession. Misdiagnoses can be very harmful so Im glad you are sticking to your guns!I hope you are able to get what you need. Im trying to learn to validate myself without outside influences. If people think you are lying or overreacting you are free to discount their opinion. No ones opinion or world view has more value than yours. Your thoughts feelings and ideas hold just as much value. Good luck to you!,CPTSD,dd4c62a,3,t5_2vvid

But i do feel embarrassed and horrible that my neighbors heard they must think i am being tortured lol.You are right i had many breakdowns right in front of her but still she refuses to believe. Im guessing she cant deal with how horrible with the situation is and cant deal with it especially for her age. But still i get angry that she should be more considerate to me but she is so sick she will never understand. You are so right this is what drives me mad the most and why i had a panic attack her denial of it and how i know everything!. i have to get away from her its going to be hard since i have so much anxiety that makes it hard to do things.I am so sorry that you went through a similar thing. That is horrible that your parents ignore it too and never puts any blame on them support theme and on you. I honestly think that people like this should have never had kids in the first place.  I have no idea why parents would act like this and ignore the child in help. My mom was similar when her son was arrested and got a long sentence she blamed it on the lawyer and called hind disgusting!! like really? i so agree with you now i know why and how  criminals are made parents that let them do whatever and never punish them for it!!,CPTSD,ddl9a1q,1,t5_2vvid

10862681,0,t3_5uv91t,March . A friend who is a social worker posted an article about CPTSD. For years I had been in and out of therapy working on bits and pieces of a larger puzzle. I even spent a couple of years working with a neurological team working on psychosomatic reactions which presented as a few things but there was no medical cause. Knowing that what I was working on had a name was euphoric. I danced. I was overjoyed. The more I looked into it the more I knew that I would finally have an approach for dealing with the problems I had worked on without success. I am not just a massive failure to cope. I have the ability to get better! Whoo hoo!First I found a whole lot of touchy feely things around self compassion which I could not stand. Then I found Mr. Grannons videos. Spartan philosophy? Yes please! Working hard and getting better in a holistic manner I am so in! A week later there was the crash. I had a pity party that I had to go back to therapy. That lasted an hour or so. Then I made the calls. I continued with Mr. Grannons videos worked through Pete Walkers books and found a grounded therapy dude who though not fully equipped to deal with all of my issues was fantastic about helping me get to healthier.,CPTSD,de0eqdk,1,t5_2vvid
10978385,0,t3_5wq5k1,You are not alone. Im right there with you.I dissociate way too much too often. Its super hard to focus for periods of time. Not just long periods of time but periods of time.I catch myself just out of it staring at a wall. Or my mind is full of racing anxious thoughts instead of my work.Like you I can do short assignments but its TOUGH trying to study or bang out finance assignments.Or even if Im not out of it theres still a big chance of getting fucked over by brain fog or be bipolar and alternate between raging so much that Id punch the wall or crying in the corner of my closet.All of my friends have graduated  years ago and its honestly disheartening when I think about the fact that its going to take me another class in summer to finish . years. Most days feel like Im a failure and just wasting my money.If you havent already Id recommend going to the disability office for accommodations. It definitely helped alleviate some of the stress for me making it A LOT more manageable.I got accommodations for a separate testing room more time to take exams extended assignment due dates and permission to take breaks during class.I dont always use these accommodations for my classes but just knowing that I have them available helped me tremendously in feeling less like I trapped and doomed. ,CPTSD,decdbvm,2,t5_2vvid
11038367,0,t3_5xl0s2,This is EXACTLY me at the moment. It seems to be really common in cptsd sufferers. I used to be strong silent I could fight my way through deaths abuse sexual assault constant violence I gritted my teeth and I was fucking invincible. There was nothing I hadnt faced no pain I hadnt felt. No one could hurt me. After I left that place people commented how strong I was. And I thought so too. I felt irritated at others around me who broke down. I didnt get it I thought toughen up for fucks sake.    Then after a couple years of safety and me getting on with my life with only minor depression I went from being ok to desperately suicidal in about two months all of a sudden. I was an animal barely able to control my aggression fear and basic fucking instincts. I fought in the psych ward I went insane and unrecognisable couldnt speak or communicate. Total breakdown. No one knew what the fuck was wrong with me. After I calmed down on a bunch of drugs I managed to speak a little. I didnt think my past had affected me at all but holy shit was I wrong. My ego took a huge necessary hit. Since then Ive learnt many things. I have no ability to recognise or feel emotions. I am afraid of literally everything. I am constantly triggered. I dissociate  leave my bodyzone out constantly I disconnect from parts of my body I have lost all ability to cope with minor stresses study is impossible no concentration cant speak in full sentences cant make eye contact cant be in crowded rooms etc etc etc. I am a fucking mess let me tell you. I feel like Ive gone from being invincible to being the weakest shyest most childish pussy on the planet. But thats not really what it is. It has to be this way. Im finally beginning to process events that my brain just severed itself from at the time.   My therapist said its a sign that this stuff needs to be worked through. That it needs to be dealt with through DBT Which Ive found super helpful and speaking with a trauma specialist. I have found out so much about what trauma does to a child. I can talk to you about it if you want  I would love to share what Ive learnt. Im still not coping that great but I know this is the way forward. Lots of therapy. Facing it acknowledging it understanding it. I never understood what happened to me really. My memories were either emotionless images or completely repressed altogether. It was bizarre. Im hoping to be able to press charges soon when I remember more. Ill get closure from that perhaps. It is a long journey from here onwards but Ive learnt so much. Ive become humbler more understanding because of it.    That strength that you had before? Its still there inside you its just that it needs to be pushed aside because its taking up too much space. Your emotions need to take the centre stage now so that you can process and heal. Your primitive brain strength protection endurance numbness is overworked and has to step back for a while because it is the emotional side limbic system that has been damaged. Sorry Im rambling a lot but what you are saying is necessary and unavoidable Im afraid. Its hard facing the horrendous past. Facing it and processing it makes your life worse for a little while before it can get better. Thats why so many veterans kill themselves andthats why its important to know that it WILL get easier. And it doesnt even take that long for it to get easier its surprising to me. You will be so incredibly powerful as a human being when you come out the other side. You have lived through the fires of hell youve hauled your burning ass OUT of hell all by yourself you will have turned around and faced your demons and defiantly grown back the flesh that was torn away and you will walk away a god of your own making.

11202117,0,t3_5zuz2v,Hi I believe what you are experiencing has to do with anxiety and fear of change. While you recognise the faulty thought pattern those are not always the cause of the problem but the result. You seem to try to apply a cbt approach which is not the cureall that it  seems to be advertised as. You say you have minimized your pain do you mean suppress? A release of pain through normal methods should ideally bring in a sense of joy and relieve. It should empower you. If you are experiencing lack of joy that might be because you are suppressing your pain which will eventually surface again. If you think that is the case you may want to look into this. Look up how to overcome grieving I wouldnt use cbt and types of dissociation and distraction which are often used to suppress pain. Also cbt causes suppression of pain when used at least in my caseIn regards to the anxiety that comes with hanging pictures  to overcome the negative  belief you need to challenge the thought yes this is cbt. Getting the pictures down will not resolve it and there is no shortcut AFAIK. Every time you get the feeling tell yourself you are not in danger and that this action alone cannot cause you to loose your home. It will take a lot of challenging to overcome it but it is doable. Dont get discouraged if you dont get results immediately. Also look up somatic therapy  as anxiety can prevent you from experiencing joy. If you have anxiety that you do not realise it could  be reflected in your body. An example would be shallow breathing or tensing you body muscles when in a relaxed position or even  Inability to concentrate. Sorry if I sound presumptuous or if I got it all wrong but I hope what I am writing makes sense to you and could be helpful.Wish you best of luck in your journey. ,CPTSD,df1quq2,3,t5_2vvid
11208011,0,t3_5zvjf4,I feel the same. Im  and a single mother and I can barely take care of my myself let alone my daughter. I struggle daily with the will to live. My body is in such a hyperaroused state and nothing is helping it. I dont know how much I can hold on. I really hate feeling like this its horrible ,CPTSD,df2eyfc,3,t5_2vvid
11248564,0,t1_df6y0zr,That is a good idea and I will ask my psychiatrist to do so. I cant even think it SUCKS..... my brain is shut off and Im all hyped up!!! I am all over the place and this happens whenever I get triggered making it hard to deal with things.....as YOU know! Ughhhhhhh Im just so insecure and feel like everyone is out to get me. I just want to graduate and get out of here!!!!! Ill talk to my psychiatrist yet again. Im an annoying one. As you may already assume. I still think this is so crazy and feel like it will make him treat me worse. The class is so small guys. Maybe I can switch professors or work from home haha seriously is that possible do you think ,CPTSD,df70axi,1,t5_2vvid
11322674,0,t3_61lepm,Im sorry youre struggling right now. Triggers are a real pain to deal with and I always feel so out of control with them. Part of why being criticized used to sting so badly for me is that growing up that was just the beginning. The criticism was the start of the abuse. Next was yelling or withholding food or attention or whatever twisted thing she could think of next. So its actually natural that we would feel anxiety and doom when were criticized. Our brains are just filling in the pattern we have. EMDR helped me a lot here as did a trauma therapist regular therapist didnt help me so much. EMDR let me reprogram my response and let me shrink the memories so I dont feel Im currently in them right now. But yeah I can definitely relate.,CPTSD,dffemfm,4,t5_2vvid
11387779,0,t1_dfmk7t7,What uBuffaloBuffalo says makes perfect sense youre talking past them. As individuals we need the ability to fail and learning how to do that is a part of recovery. Otherwise youre holding yourself to an impossible standard and will never learn how to be kind to yourself when you inevitably do fail at some thing. And yes this is coming from some one who has had her life threatened by failure in multiple ways. And still continues to be! I held myself to impossible standards because of these experiences and because I couldnt meet these standard I hated myself and was deeply unkind to myself. One of the first things I had to do in therapy is learn how to accept the fact I have and will again fail but that doesnt make me a terrible person. I have the exact same issue as OP with apply for jobs and learning how to fail how to devote time and energy into something for no result for whatever reason is a massive part of addressing the issue. ,CPTSD,dfmsaps,2,t5_2vvid
11459227,0,t1_dfuvp73,Haha thats funny I love that you picked up my accent without hearing me!! Im giggling imagining an American reading something in an Australian accent in their head. Mustve been intuition! I am a kiwi but moved to Australia while in high school and then emigrated back again. So Im a kiwi that says cunt alot and I do a very good Australian accent. You just have to make your voice like if a crow could talk. I appreciate that you at least havent confused the Australian and kiwi accents with the British ones. Heaps of the Canadians and Americans I meet hear them as being similar for some reason.Im glad to hear that you felt better and had a good chuckle. Im imagining it was the sort of laugh where you throw your head back and maybe even a bit of pee comes out.Maybe the US isnt for you I duno. If the people there cant see that youre kind and just a bit cheeky then they should get absolutely FUCKED. Please dont feel afraid to go live somewhere else there is nothing to stop you afaik. If you do come to nz hit me up my home is open to you F student will not murder you as long as you dont murder me first haha.Edit Dont forget to tell yourself  I am loved valued and important. By yourself the boyfriend and your new friend. This mantra helped me to resolve my own insecurities. ,CPTSD,dfuw98v,1,t5_2vvid
11603201,0,t1_dgb7phf,Weirdly that selfcritic can be a bizarre form of selfcare because when you were a kid accepting the scapegoat role was a way of protecting yourself in the toxic system by adapting. If you catch yourself having selfcritic patterns maybe dont say argh that selfcritic is bad but selfcare is good but maybe point out the originally protecting nature of this part of you and transform it into a protection that serves you better in the present. Value and highlight the selfcaring nature of this critic and point out that for selfcare to function best in the now the selfcritic can appreciate the beautifully safe present and become the actual selfprotection that it WANTS to for you. As in that is a form of good that needs further blossoming and evolving.,CPTSD,dgb8de2,2,t5_2vvid
11623332,0,t1_dgdct93,I guess my age isnt really what Im worried about as imo  years old is definitely still an early developmental stage. My worry is more that because my trauma isnt a cut and dry abuserabusedvictim situation for example death just happens no one caused it I dont fit into the examples that are presented with most information about CPTSD. I worry that this will hinder my healing because theres no one I can blame or get angry with you know? Like it just happened to me. Theres no one to blame no one is at fault. It just happened. I feel like a lot of peoples healing involves anger towards the people who abused them but I cant get angry at my parents for dying.Im realizing now though that everyones trauma is multilayered and complex and maybe no one fits into the cut and dry scenario presented in literature. I want to say that I know what you mean about your symptoms though. I also feel mentally disabled  but you have to remember that PTSD is a mental disability literally structural changes in the brain from trauma. I was reading a study yesterday that said PTSD sufferers have double the chances of developing Alzheimers later in life and I believe it.This study discusses the biological changes in the brain I found it really interesting I dissociate constantly as well have trouble expressing myself verbally have trouble with basic math problems have trouble with directions coordination socializing learning new concepts..the list goes on and on and on. Ive been diagnosed with learning disabilities and a laundry list of mental illnesses but after my CPTSD diagnosis Im beginning to see clearly how living in extreme stress for so long took over my mind and damaged my brain. Living in constant hypervigilance erodes the brain and massively distracts from the ability to perform everyday tasks...So I know exactly what you mean by mental disability and if you feel concerned then I would certainly urge you to pursue that but I just wanted to let you know the extent that cPTSD can impair someone.,CPTSD,dgdil33,1,t5_2vvid
11631602,0,t1_dged6qn,gt I would wager there is a lot more going on with people than just is a bully or is a victim.Not enough to warrant attention. Ive done the detail fetishism thing and all its done is to hemorrhage resources while giving me no advantage. So few people are as complex as you claim those few that are mathematically cannot be worth the trouble of examining their greyness.P.S. can mods downvote posts? ,CPTSD,dgegdjv,1,t5_2vvid
11632459,0,t3_65ym70,I have heard that getting disability for invisible problems is next to impossible. I havent bothered exactly because of this but my problem is not holding down jobs but getting them in the first place. Once interviewers quit prejudging me Im fine.,CPTSD,dgejvf7,2,t5_2vvid
11676911,0,t3_66gwui,If I can offer a different perspective... Its okay. I havent laughed for maybe the last  years but I needed that space to be real and love myself and be who I am learn how to deal with the fallout of the trauma and learn how to avoid retraumatisation. Now I feel at a more comfortable place Im starting to laugh again. Little by little. But its different now because Im mostly selfassured Im not doing it for attention or distraction Im doing it know Ive come to terms with trauma and I wont be vulnerable to hurt this time. So let yourself follow the process of healing.. laughter will be the last thing to come after recovery specifically because it is one of the most vulnerable. Right now you need protection selfcare recovery. Humour is hard to find when youre face to face with the trauma youve endured and once you accept that that bit of acceptance is part of recovery too mainly in validating your sadness. One day you will but it doesnt have to be right now. Learn to love yourself and laughter will come naturally soon after. I think joy really is one of the last emotions to shift.,CPTSD,dgjlemi,3,t5_2vvid
11682554,0,t1_dgiz69p,That is interesting. That is exactly the type of boost I need. Thank you! Im still in the very early stages and still have yet to commit to a full routine. I really enjoy biking so I dont have to prep myself up very much. Walking I have to push myself a little. I enjoy it though. I usually put on music which really helps. I mostly just say I need some sunlight or just to move around. It helps with the guilt of being in the house all the time. But for things like actual exercising in a mundane routine way I usually grovel first. It is so hard to get into it and I never really enjoy it. I just tell myself it will be over with. It is so hard too because I have to pee every  minutes which interrupts my flow. I also get very distracted with the internet and procrastinate before a mini workout IF I do one. ,CPTSD,dgk8g1a,1,t5_2vvid
11696844,0,t1_dgk9mij,Were you the scapegoat or golden child or anything? I am a scapegoat and although creepy i cant say i am afraid of him at this point in my life.. when centered. I think that is because i knew he was badstood up to him from the start. Even when he was nice i caught onto it being a fake pattern early early on. Or maybe you are the golden child and your dad treated you differently than your sister so you see him in a diff. light while still confused cause you saw the other side of him too. Regardless the fact he even has  sides that are confusing you and your sister did those kinds of things at a young age hes not a nice dude. Everyone was intimidated and scared of my dad. But they would run and be his bitch if he gave them the slightest positive attention.. until he gets annoyed and sick of them and throws them away. But these types of people are extraaaaaa nice compared  a normal human. Its so tricky cause you look back and remember those parts that tell a completely different story than the repressed memories coming out. Its confusing and creepy. Being confused and questioning who he is in this matter is a reason to get even more mad at this niceness. And omg animals hated mine too!!!!!!!!! He faked being allergic  all of them my entire childhood so i thought he was this poor sick man. My friends and friends parents never let them sleepover my house and i never understood why.,CPTSD,dglutdj,2,t5_2vvid

11798398,0,t1_dgxd4sa,I know exactly how you feel. Learning that a lot of my hesitance comes from illness not genuine rational preference has helped and reparenting has got me thinking about it more optimistically but it still feels like a death sentence looming over me. ,CPTSD,dgxe0ir,5,t5_2vvid
11800005,0,t1_dgv1ro9,gt ...yet the hugs dont get through.I relate to this so much.  Even on the rare occasions when I do get a hug from a safe caring person it barely gets in. One thing Ive been working on is responding with thanks instead of sorry both to physical and to verbal reassurance since my therapist pointed out that apologizing is kind of pushing away saying I dont deserve it not letting it in etc whereas expressing gratitude means I have to let it in enough to appreciate it at least.  Its hard to do I reeeaally feel like I need to apologize in those moments but when I can manage to say thanks and really mean it that does seem to help shift things at least a little bit...,CPTSD,dgxkkth,3,t5_2vvid
