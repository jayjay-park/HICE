5656590,0,t3_3skbdx,If I interpret the files correctly you can choose this ambition if you do not have a bloodline trait but one of your parents grandparents or greatgrandparents did. As bloodlines are inherited patrilineally a female with a bloodline trait among your ancestry would probably satisfy the condition. Not sure whether bastards inherit bloodlines but that might be another way.Since bloodlines are exclusive you cant already have a bloodline to choose the ambition. You also cannot have any of the following traits mane incapable humble slothful undead dremora lichI havent found the files concerning possible events connected to the ambition but I guess there would be some events with a fairly low chance of occuring where you can claim the bloodline of your ancestors. Claiming any bloodline satisfies the completion conditon. Completing the ambition gets you  prestige and a negative opinion modifier with anyone of the bloodline you claimed. Edit found the event. Mean time to happen  months reduced by diligent gregarious and Intrigue gt . Increased by slothful slob strange dont know which trait that is probably absentminded? low intrigue. There might be a mistake in the code  not that Im any good at reading it  but whatever diplomacy you have the MTTH is increased anyway. So its a very very rare event even if your character is diligent gregarious and a decent intriguer.,ElderKings,cwy96vk,2,t5_2zo4f
