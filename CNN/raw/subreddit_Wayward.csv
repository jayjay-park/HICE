8630753,0,t3_4wjnj8,Im not sure which update it was but we can no longer quickslot gravel to set it down which is a bit of a bummer because I was using it to build bridges between near islands and now it takes longer. Id like the ability to farm rabbits as well as chickens  maybe we could build a nonlethal trap of some sort? Or make a lasso out of rope that allows you to catch things instead of killing them. Id like it too if planting specific plants increased the chances of benign animals spawning nearby. Ive hit a high malignity  and Im happy to keep fighting monsters  but Id like to be able to run into the odd chicken now and then. Loving the game ,Wayward,d6kg7ca,1,t5_2ukl6

9824138,0,t1_danl0lr,Id like to point outNeedles are REALLY COMMON when you dissassemble bits of bone. Even more if you grow ANY cacti.String...well if it isnt common youre playing the game wrong.Find tall grass. Plant it. Put some form of gathering tool next to the grass seeds in your quickslots and mass produce tall grass blades.They dont make the MOST durable string but when it comes to sutures durability is a nonissue.You can use items in bagsat least in equipped ones. I load all my sutures in there so theyre nice and compact. Itll keep you alive against anything that isnt aberrant if you have literally any armor.NoteApparently strength scales aberrants some. So watch out?Id build a quick escape tunnelthat is  cave entrances close togetherin case one that you cant fight comes by.,Wayward,dao3tag,1,t5_2ukl6
11430442,0,t1_demikt3,So.. that first video sounds like theres always a shelter floating around and he walks around for a bit and finds one easily. Is that really the case? I havent seen a free building yet in the few games Ive played and in the current one which Im finally doing well Ive done quite a bit of walking around this island.,Wayward,dfrmmzc,1,t5_2ukl6
