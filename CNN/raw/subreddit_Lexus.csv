154473,0,t1_ceveunr,I am not a technician so this response comes directly from our service advisors.He told me that Regardless of the type of oil that cars oil is designed to be changed every km  miles. Synthetic oil is technically better But since you have to change it so regularlly is there any added benefits? No not really. Synthetic costs more. Some feel better putting more expensive products in their cars. Hope this helps!,Lexus,cew0xyu,2,t5_2sflg

Grab the wheel while its still bolted on and slightly jerk on it up and down. If its jerking around and making a clunking noise its a bad ball joint. The out tire rod is right there as well. You can see If its collapsed. You can wiggle it back and forth from front to back if its worn out with one hand. Rockauto parts had my front left and right upperlower ball joints and outer tire rods for about  total. Think its just  for each side lower ball joint. I replaced all mine on both sides since I was going for an alignment afterwards. Get Moog parts if you dont go with factory parts. The dealer wanted  each side plus alignment.

5417242,0,t1_cw43jq5,gt The RX can be stressful to drive in a city  way more so than the NX. And the RX seems to be about k more comparably equipped. That price difference buys a lot of gas insurance and maintenance. This is definitely a valid point. While I love the new RX design I just realized that its  longer than the current model and for a city driver thats not the right direction. Think I need to head back to the dealership soon to test drive both the RX and the hybrid NX but it seems like the latter might be a far better fit when it comes to size and money especially if I can get a wellequipped NX for around the same as a basic RX.

I think Lexus may underestimate how many of us actually keep our cars for a long time.I am a huge proponent of transmission fluid changes for the well being of any car.  JDM wise men always emphasize to change it as often as every two oil changes.  Its a pretty big sell to go from that to lifetime and even more if you live in a ridiculously hot or cold area.TLDR have the dealer flush it every k.,Lexus,d69fhbt,2,t5_2sflg

8885771,0,t3_51ymfp,gt How can I become a resource at the dealership for customers beyond getting them the car they want?To this my dealer emails me every now and then not in an annoying way to check up on how things are going or if I have any questions. Finding that nonannoying communication frequency is great it makes me want to go back to the dealer for things. Hes also open for me to just email him randomly with a question and gives me great answers.,Lexus,d7fy00y,2,t5_2sflg

10502352,0,t3_5qd5dh,As long as nothing critical is already damaged like having a cracked or loose fuse box cover or a missing brake fluid cap then you should be fine using low pressure water think light mist out of your garden hose. No need to cover anything up assuming nothing is damaged where water could enter. It helps to remove all the engine covers first and isnt a bad idea to use compressed air to blow all the old dust and debris out if available. If you cant blow it out be sure to spend plenty of time rinsing as the dust can turn into dried mud in all sorts of places. Use a mild degreaser or detergent and soft scrub brush on all the areas you can reach on a warm engine been running maybe  minutes. When youre all done reinstall all the covers and take it on a good drive to help evaporate any water that may remain in crevices or under the intake manifold etc. Source Im a mechanic and do this daily after large repairs. ,Lexus,dcyjwud,2,t5_2sflg

But otherwise tires oil and basic standard maintenance and shes still running like a champ!  I believe the timing belt needs to be done around k cant remember offhand if its k or k intervals but thats not too terrible on the wallet.  Find either a Toyota dealership or a local shop for maintenance  a million times cheaper than the Lexus shop and my Lexus shop is pretentious a.f..  It hangs after nd gear a bit but theres a ECU chip update if I understand correctly thats not too terribly expensive if it really bothers you.  Not worth it personally I just got used to it as you do with certain things on any car.I still get compliments despite it being a bit of a grandma car literally for me single owner some yo bankers wife.  Its also inconspicuous as hell  rarely get the attention of cops despite some speedy habits at times.Overall Im a very happy owner and it turned me on to Lexus for life.
