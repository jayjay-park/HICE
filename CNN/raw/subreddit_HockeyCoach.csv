1185563,0,t1_ci2z6yf,There are a lot of things that can affect how quickly theyre on the attack.. Team playIts hard for a player to be aggressive on the puck if he knowsthinks his teammates wont be there to support him should he need it.  If the team actively supports a player then theyre more likely to play aggressively.. Skill level and confidenceIf a player doesnt feel that theyll win a battle for the puck they wont be aggressive on the attack instead theyll play it safe and sit back.  This also can be affected by any negative reinforcement they receive should they get burned.  If the coach or teammates have a tendency to bashteasetaunt players who play aggressively and lose those players will learn to avoid that situation.  Players have to be allowed to make mistakes its the only way they can learn!. Set playsWhen players have a specific play that they have practiced they can remove the what should I do? barrier.  A lot of players tend to over think what theyre going to do once they are on the attack.  If you can help to alleviate that theyll be much quicker to go on the attack.  The quickest way to do that is to have a set play that can be run.For example If youre forechecking in the offensive corner and you get control pass the puck behind the net immediately.  This can help a player know what he is supposed to do with the puck so he can just focus on the execution.  Additionally it helps his teammates to know where they should go to support his play.If youre the coach of the team Id recommend a few fixed plays to help increase their confidence.  Additionally make sure that the team is focused on support  not just on their own highlight reel.Otherwise have your sons talk to their linemates and tell them where theyre going to be putting the puck.  They can take control of their own line and become their own coach.Im usually not in favor of constraining players to a specific play or set of plays but it can definitely help get them past the fear of the not knowing what to do.,HockeyCoach,ci2zti3,1,t5_32135
