7907429,0,t1_d44s4kd,Dont mind the cut too much though I dont think shes this bad to justify a bottom  ranking or anything at all.WHAT IS THAT NOM? Ronnie helps make BB the glorious trainwreck it is early on. He is responsible for so many good moments and I love how hes pwnted before the jury phase even hits. He has an iconic HOH reign and is involved in a few meltdownsfights. Hes a better character than more than half of the BB cast. Depending on how the other ranker feel I might veto him if hes cut.,BigBrotherRankdownII,d44vbvz,1,t5_3cs2e

8382540,0,t3_4tngm4, Ragan Fox BB thOddly enough this is my first BB cut but I really cant stand the season. Incredibly boring strategy wise and as far as characters go so many of them feel contrived forced andor boring. BB feels like the start of the cringeworthy editing and awful DRs and the like. Ragan on paper should be a good character and idk if Id even have him this low but hes just sour and a tad cringey on the show for me and hearing that he was awful on the feeds is no surprise.He had his merits like his endearing friendship with Matt or taste in allies like Britney and him and Rachel feuding was fun too. He isnt bottom tier and a terrible HG but just one that I found to come off as holier than thou and condescending in that infamous fight with Rachel. Sorry for the shit writeup tbh Ragan is the only I could cut at all given how I havent seen BB and BB and not cutting Jeff or Holly this early in any way shape or form.uIanicRR is up and oh yeah Ill nominate Kara Monaco,BigBrotherRankdownII,d5pd6d4,1,t5_3cs2e

9992665,0,t1_dba1k4c,This for me though I still have him this high. Some of his melodramatic moments were a bit too much and seriously a near  foot guy getting in the face of Talla just felt a tad too ugly. Hes pretty one note for most of the season and its a good note but still very one dimensional until he opens up about wanting to win for all the young little gay boys across Canada feeling inadequate and that a fabulous  year old gay guy wearing glitter can win the game. Top  is just a perfect spot for him.Excited for crazy nominations to come!,BigBrotherRankdownII,dba2m0n,1,t5_3cs2e
10005080,0,t1_dbboc30,Sort of walked into that one p but wasnt Mitch who was in Rauls the eventual HOHs ear trying to get rid of Tim at that time and didnt Raul still dislike Maddy Ramsey?,BigBrotherRankdownII,dbbovmj,1,t5_3cs2e
