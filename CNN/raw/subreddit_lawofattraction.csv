671321,0,t1_cggko3w,that was an analogy I guess.Usually its more of a feeling rather than a sentence. Its hard to describe it. it feels more like an intention rather than what you mean literally. If its coupled with a pure uplifting hopeful feeling then you have your sweet spot.I normally have all of these in my head. I dont necessarily declare it out or shout it or read it or write it etc. It remains in my head. Sometimes it appears as It would be nice to... or I want... or Itll be great for everyone if... But what I find most consistent is the emotion behind it. Its pure. Its not needy and insecure. Its ... innocent? Im not really sure how to describe it but when you get the hang of it you will see similar trends in your manifestations to what I am saying.,lawofattraction,cggku9r,4,t5_2rfq0

1308851,0,t3_291xb4,I really love the idea of LOA. Ive put it to test in my own life and no manifestations yet  but I just feel so much better.Everything in your entire life is a manifestation.Without manifestations you wouldnt be having a physical experience Also thoughts and emotions are manifestations too.So if you are feeling better you have already manifested what you want.The paradox for me here is that you need to believe this stuff or else it wont workIts not that it wont work. The Universe is always giving you an abundance.If you focus on lack the Universe will give you an abundance of lack.If you focus on abundance the Universe will give you an abundance of abundance.So if you dont believe you can have something and focus on the absence of it from your life rather than the presence of it and focus on what you dont want the Universe will support you in that belief and give you an abundance of what you dont want.,lawofattraction,cigv1tn,1,t5_2rfq0
1330740,0,t3_29al0j,Unconditional love kindness amp compassion love as not in a relationship and love as in loving everyone amp everything. is the only answer. When you treat such persons everytime with unconditional love they stop treating you bad and either start responding with love or be neutral with you but it takes some time.Also focus on their ve stuffs everyone has lots of ve stuff rather than their ve sutffs.PS From my experience people who treat others bad are the ones who needs lots of love. But at the same time some of them does not know the meaning of love and are not ready to accept love so I just be neutral with them say like treating random people while you are walking on a crowded road you dont love them or hate them you just be neutral with them. ,lawofattraction,cijbpye,5,t5_2rfq0

3639700,0,t1_cq7459z,The way a hologram works is that the whole is made of of tiny similar geometric definition pieces of the whole.  Take a circle infinitely large zoom in and you see circles.  Zoom in again more circles.  This goes on forever.I think most people dont know what they put out.  My roommate talks non stop about not having money.  She dropped a  bill the other day and lost it paid rent late and was charged a fee work messed up her hours she didnt get paid in full.  She expects to have no money she tells everyone she has no money but shes not aware that shes doing it to herself or at least contributing to her having no money.  I think the whole idea of awakening or enlightenment or expanding consciousness is just learning what my definitions are and analyze them from an outside nonjudgemental perspective.  By definitions I mean figuring out what I truly believe how I see the universe how the universe sees me.  Is everyone conspiring to make me the greatest version of myself?  If I believe that truly I will act like it and that will reflect in my universe.  To say that we have no way of knowing what we put out is a closed minded statement.  Prove to me that no one ever was able to be consciously aware of all of their beliefs.Paradox is powerful.  Anyone in this sub will tell you paradox is the point of power.  Holding two contradictory beliefs can be unimaginable if youve never done it.  I have a  Mercedes E wagon.  Its not in my driveway its not where I work no one borrowed it from me.  But I know its mine.  I know its a piece of metal I dont need.  I dont care if it actually materializes or not.  It doesnt have to.  I know that its mine anyway.  All I have to do is close my eyes watch a youtube video appreciate someone elses.We attracted each other.  It takes two to tango.  But this is obvious you posted in a sub that I read.  I think chances are slim that I wouldnt read your post.  We both share ideas on the topic thats more overlap.As for your story thats all in your imagination and has absolutely nothing to do with me.

You know how your vibe would be by how you feel. If you feel good then your vibe is I appreciate where I am and appreciate where I am going. If you do not feel good then your vibe would be focused on the lack of a house. Every subject is really two subjects What is wanted and the lack of it. And you know which you are focused on by how you feel. If you feel good you are focusing on what you want. If you do not feel good you are focused on the lack or absence of what you want.So if you do not feel good you want to soothe yourself and shift your focus from the lack of what you want to what you do want and you will feel better. That better feeling lets you know that you have shifted your point of attraction to attract what you want. Abraham recommends to make peace with where you are and  ignoring what is and focusing on what you want. They have also said that one of the quickest ways to get to where you want to be is by appreciating where you are and what you have right now.Here are some quotes from Abraham So you want to focus on being for a house and offer no resistance to where you are.    ,lawofattraction,crbp111,2,t5_2rfq0
4124380,0,t3_37wfyd,Hi thanks for posting and congrats on achieving your goals. I believe vision boards affirmations gratitude lists and the like can be a great starter kit into a deeper understanding of D reality and even a metaphorical bandaid to prevent your relapse into lower vibrational states. But personally I stopped feeling the need for these things once I got a firmer grip on my emotions and thought processes as I believe doing things in order to manifest or out of selfdiscipline can actually delay or even prevent your desired outcome. As soon as you associate any kind of work feeling with your goals youre going to make yourself work for it  So I generally focus on feeling good avoiding negative people and developing a sense of certainty toward my goals. Meditation will get you there faster but thats about it I will drop a certain technique as soon as I realize Ive learned it  only to use it when I feel like it. So my suggestion is to forget your goals as much as you can as in to stop thinking of them as goals or even altogether think of it as trying to remember something by thinking of something different until it comes back to you. If theyre actually something you wish for theyll keep popping back in your life anyway  in that case I tend to follow these hints which has generally led to my biggest manifestations.

5687469,0,t3_3svt88,Your posts speaks to me.  years ago I was in that exact same spot where I felt like my life was out of control. I too was on a spiritual journey and my inner searching led me to find that first before I would see true lasting happiness and success I had to get my emotions under control.That it easier aid than done and its a process but it truly can be done. Meditation every morning is a great first step. Meditation and learning to let go and observe instead of getting sucked into a bottomless pit of emotion.Law of Attraction works and if your inner world is in turmoil then surely your outer world will be as well.What worked for me is doing exercises from a LOT of personal development books. Jack Canfield Wayne Dwyer and Tony Robbins books have been extremely helpful. Now Im at the point where I feel like I would love to help other people overcome the emotional obstacles in their lives as well.One thing that Ive been reading about that shows a lot of promise is EFT. I came across a book called The Tapping Solution that I think you should check out.

6501674,0,t3_44ov5d,I made affirmations of total health and complete healing of anything that may be wrong with me...Were you focused on health WellBeing and vitality?Or were you focused on healing anything wrong with you?Because theres a vibrational difference between those two. The first focused on WellBeing the second focused on the lack of WellBeing.Also after awhile after the first or second thing happen the whatisness of what you did not had more of your attention so you continued to attract what you were giving your attention to.If you manifested the opposite of what you wanted the only way that could happen is if you were giving more attention to the lack or absence of what you wanted than focused on what you wanted.So even though you were saying nice sounding affirmations your vibration and focus was not on WellBeing. The Law of Attraction does not hear your words it responds to your vibration and gave you more of what you were actually feeling and giving your attention which was the lack or absence of WellBeing.But looking back doesnt serve you since all of your power is now.So now you want to focus on thoughts that feel good when you think them and not to prevent illness but to appreciate wellness.Appreciating wellness is different than preventing illness. Theyre two different frequencies.Focus more on what you appreciate about your body and not trying to heal anything that you deem as something gone wrong because nothing has. What happens is a vibrational match to where your focus has been. So now after receiving indicators giving you clarity of what you dont want you want to shift your attention to what you do want and how you want to feel and thoughts that help you feel good or feel better and the indicators of WellBeing will begin to present themselves to you indicating the shift your vibration.,lawofattraction,czrtltz,4,t5_2rfq0

My heart and thoughts are with you. I dont think LoA applies in the conventional application but I KNOW it works for receiving signs. Ill explainMy friend lived out of state for a couple of years before moving back. He rode the bus to work every day in that time and he befriended a couple of Jehovahs witnesses. He was an atheist so his relationship with him was purely a friendship. He said they gave him a card summarizing their beliefs in case he ever needed it. He told me that story about two weeks ago. He passed on the th . I am not specifically Christian but John  has always been a passage that stuck with me. I was struck by that connection in my state of shock on Thursday and it provided me great comfort. About two hours after finding him I got home. Low and behold a pair of Jehovahs witnesses arrive at my door. They hand me a pamphlet that says we will be together in paradise on the front and has John  as the first words on page one. I cried. Ive never received such a powerful signal. I never intentionally attracted our desired a confirmation of his life after death but there is zero doubt in my mind that my subconscious has never desired anything more.

In the summer Im in my highest levels of alignment and spend morning until noon mostly laying on the beach listening to AbeHicks or good music doing focus wheels etc ... and reserve client work for afternoons.

For the past few months the LHC has been smashing protons together at ridiculously high speeds in search of the elusive Higgs boson. Many particles have been discovered using particle accelerators by recording what results from the proton collisions.  The thing is these proton beams are putting out enormous energies so if one were to literally be in the LHC you would suffer some pretty crazy injuries. Just look what happened to this guy when he stuck his head in a particle beam  The way they can tell if theyve found the Higgs without observing the interaction is if the energy decay matches the signature of what the math says it should look like. The discovery of the Higgs boson would verify a portion of quantum field theory called the Higgs field which is bought to give all particles mass.

It was formed out of the outside light. Under its pointing finger there was an old sleeveless shirt of mine with the number  on it. I also googled it and got to the same site as you telling me that my wishes and prayers are becoming reality.

8985069,0,t3_53c8t2,Im still very new to all this so definitely NOT an expert but heres the way I approach LOA.  I dont expect manifestations to just fall out of the sky all the time without any effort or action on my part. Sure sometimes things can and do just show up seemingly out of nowhere but for the most part for things like better jobs relationships etc I still have to perform some inspired actions.  In order for me to obtain that perfect job that I visualize and KNOW is waiting for me I still have to send out resumes network and actually apply.  Same with relationships.  I KNOW my ideal partner is out there and can feel myself getting closer to him but I still have to put myself out there and leave my house socialize and just go about my day.  Are crappy things still going to happen and is life still going to throw me some curve balls? Sure but I can choose to go about my day being anxious afraid and depressed about it or instead choose to be grateful for all that is good in my life see and feel the beauty of the world that is all around me and be receptive to the good stuff when it comes my way.  I dont really know how to describe the feeling adequately but since I started this journey a few weeks ago and really let go of all my doubts and reservations Ive noticed a definite shift in my entire perspective and attitude...on pretty much everything.  Yes I still get anxious afraid and depressed sometimes but not to the extent I used to and those feelings and emotions just sort of pass through me now.  They dont become my permanent frame of reference anymore. I hope this has helped you some. Again not an expert but just wanted to share what Ive noticed about changes in my own life.

9981839,0,t3_5iicq0,You are genuinely going through a difficult time and I understand what it feels like to be that overwhelmed and alone...so youre really going to hate what Im about to say and even I hate hearing it but...Stop blaming other people.You have classic victim mentality. And it might be true your girlfriend and friends might have walked away from you you might be in circumstances that make your life uncomfortable but if you continue saying they abandoned me the system is against me everything is a struggle then youre going to get more of that. Self pity has its place but it isnt productive. Its actually freeing to put things in a neutral light and stop saying things are good or bad. Its a fact you got left. Its a fact you are unhappy. But you dont need to put any more thought into those things than you already have. Deciding that you simple ARE not simply are lonely not simply are a victim but simply ARE is the first step.Life is full of neutral experiences and we are the ones to decide if that situation is satisfactory or not. If not you move in a different direction. Part of LOA is making peace with whatever comes your way and doing so many kind things for yourself that you end up in a good mood most of the time. Peace acceptance and the enjoyment of lifes little novelties are the foundation for happiness content and self love. Love yourself so much that you simply know you will bounce back from whatever is going on in your life and respect yourself so much that you wont want to wallow in self pity.There is more to LOA but until you understand those things the rest is useless.,lawofattraction,db8nu7t,3,t5_2rfq0

I explained to her how I told him not to and how I was sorry if it took her a bit by surprise. She never replied but thats understandable since it was a bit awkward this was in FebruaryOn her last ever day of school she sent me an FR. I accepted it and sent her a friendly Hello how are you? I dont know why she sent me the FR in the first place because she just ignored my msg. I decided a month later to just remove her from social media altogether and just forget about her. Months go on and in September she sent me another FR. I accepted it thinking that maybe she came to her senses and maybe she would msg me. She didnt msg me and I did not msg her again and I will not. The ball is in her court and if she ever wants to she can do it herself. I want to talk to her of course but Im not running around like an absolute idiot msging her only to be potentially ignored.I do believe that I manifested the nd FR from her because I wanted to speak to her.

10133668,0,t3_5kwokc,Work from the bottom up. What do you need right now to feel stable? A job a friend counseling an outlet for the feelings that are surfacing... those are not necessarily your basics but they are examples of very basic things that would help you to get past this confusion and hurt. You cannot move forward until you make that a priority.The rest of it feeling proud and confident in yourself comes more easily when you begin acting as your own emotional caretaker. Patch up the most urgent basic hurts and anxieties and dont focus on the rest until you do. The process of personal care taking forces you to get to know yourself and when you know yourself it is much easier to make selfimprovements without abusing yourself. You will not change your personality your personality will evolve. Your style will follow and your light will shine as a result. Perspective is everything and when you are hurt and feeling unsupported it can be very hard to get into a positive state of mind. I did this through counseling and still go back every so often to refresh myself. Free counseling services are usually available by masters students at university campuses.,lawofattraction,dbsf7cm,1,t5_2rfq0

10331538,0,t1_dcf32se,See I just dont believe this. I have no resistance. Im not a match to these. The antimanifestations are also the most extreme version of voiding the original desire. Making peace is assuming loa or conscious creation doesnt exist.For example wanting to love a man faithfully in an awesome exclusive relationship and the antimanifesting being the wonderful man cheating on you.Would you want to continue the same avenue if it manifested in such a way that it was in direct opposition to your desire? Would you want to continue to put your faith in the reality where you cant discreate this man cheating on you? Or does it force you to let go like in my cases where the subsequent manifestations other men etc do the exact same thing. Void themselves.This is really where my frustration and worry comes in.  I am not doing this and I dont see how acting or thinking any differently could possibly help it. Loa is not about fearfully controlling every single minute thing your doing its about being. I am being someone in alignment with my desires. ,lawofattraction,dcf4yiz,1,t5_2rfq0

And I walk to my ride after school and see a hot red mustang and I mean very red mustang that I have never seen before which put a grand smile on my face let me tell you. So some odd days later I read on a technique to tell your self that you are switching timelines into the timeline where you have what you want so I said Show me a lime green car to indicate my new timeline where me and my crush are dating and are very happy but whenever you want I dont really care I just want to see it. come a few days later today and I see a lime green mustang on the way home! Amd now at this point I now that it will come to me I am fully confident of that. But why did all of them come as mustangs? Could that mean anything idk lol,lawofattraction,dd9hjmy,1,t5_2rfq0

And I think a lot of other people think similarly.Also though I think were able to get results beyond what we expect or even dream if we do make the effort in trying our best.

11403752,0,t3_62qt8p,Ive never thought itd matter. The law of attraction is a law. Its not a religious deity. It doesnt give a shit about your motives or why you want something. Because honestly motives being good or bad is entirely a matter of perception and Id think that the universe being able to do things in ways wed never consider means that if it manifests sentience that way itd be at such a higher level that our perceptions of motives and dark or not would be kinda beneath it. Why would it care about you wanting to manifest success to rub in someone elses face when it is capable of literally anything. Why would you care about one ant rubbing its food find in anothers face when you can just spit and drown their whole colony without any effort? The biggest issue would be if your motivations hold negative emotions itd be hard to vibrate the frequency needed to manifest what you want. ,lawofattraction,dfoln79,5,t5_2rfq0

11644349,0,t3_661hh0,Amazing! I know that feeling when you just cant stop laughing because you see a sign or a manifestation that was made for you! Its strange but no matter how big those signs are I tend to forget them so thats why I started to write them down into a LoA journal. May I ask whats your exact method you use? Thank you!,lawofattraction,dgfwfn5,1,t5_2rfq0
11644914,0,t3_6654p8,Sometimes you need to take a step forward. You say youre not in a position to meet new people why cant you put yourself in a position to meet new people? I think the universe pushes you in a direction but sometimes you need to keep walking. When it comes to attracting others I think you need to feel attractive love yourself lose weightget fit or whatever you need to do to feel attractive and confident  do it. You will feel less insecure with the LOA and the outcome of your life when you let go of wanting to know the outcome and just start living ,lawofattraction,dgfyqop,1,t5_2rfq0

11723874,0,t3_679n8o,Haha I feel like this post could have been written by me! I too have been through a recent breakup and became pretty obsessive with using the LOA to get him back. Did affirmations gratitude journal everything and although we are in contact it hasnt achieved what I wanted until interestingly enough I surrendered myself aka kind of gave up knowing whatever happened I would be absolutely fine and trusting that one day we would be together just not on the timeline I had planned and next thing I know he calls me asking to see me admitting he misses me. This is compared to the week before when he is cold and distant. I honestly believe its true when they say when you start to move on doesnt have to be getting with someone else but energetically move on they can feel it and contact you. You can see so many stories on the internet of this happening its crazy. Re the concert thats up to you. If I were you Id ask myself if Ive really improved as a person got independent got happy. Something I had to learn the hard way was that my relationship as I knew it was over and if Im ever going to have another relationship with this person it had to come out of a place of positivity and love not lack of the relationship. If you are focusing on lack you will attract more lack. You can affirm a million times over and still get nowhere trust me Ive tried because you are focusing on what you dont want orrrrrrr feel like you need this specific person. Ive read lots of people who say you need to affirm this or better and not be so specific in fear of attaching to lack or disappointment. So maybe you get with this person or maybe someone who is way more aligned with who you are right now. Keep your eyes open and keep working on you especially if youre going to see your ex again you want it to be a positive experience and show you have improved yourself and you dont NEED them you just want them. You can stand on your own two feet and be your own person very important lesson Ive had to learn. Im defs no expert but listening to Abraham Hicks on YouTube taught me a lot.,lawofattraction,dgoxjhd,4,t5_2rfq0
11748910,0,t3_67nbba,You need to work directly with your subconscious as it may take ages if you try to work through the conscious mind first.On top of the standard advice of meditation hacks to consider include EFTan example being here Im not saying this is the best site just a random google search EFT for money blocksPlus look up subliminal recordings with abundant or wealth affirmations and combine it with isochronic tones to train your brainwaves to the right frequency for receiving these affirmations into your subconscious. Often alphatheta sometimes gamma Search YouTube Spotify Amazon Music and ITunes.Hemisync and Holosync have some very good reviews so does Dr Jeffrey Thompson. TLDR  try selfhypnosis EFT meditation brainwave entrainment and subliminal affirmations anything that goes direct to your subconscious. ,lawofattraction,dgrro2c,4,t5_2rfq0
11796977,0,t3_68afth,Im not sure positive is more powerful than negative.
