213278,0,t3_1wiss7,The answer depends on your difficulty level your tech level your assaults ranks and your play style. Early on shotguns can definitely be exchanged for rifles this lets your assaults be a little safer by staying at range.  For example the difference between a basic rifle and a basic shotgun will completely change the play style of an early low rank assault.  Once youve advanced tech and your assaults have some rank not taking a higherlevel shotgun over a rifle will reduce your assaults damage output a lot.The higher in difficulty you get the more youd consider getting a shotgun because you need to be able to play aggressively and shotguns have a chance of OHKOing enemies with their higher HP.  For example lets look at ballistic weapon damage on normal sectoids and thin men have HP rifles can kill them with a single hit.  On Classic each have  Hp and rifles now require a critical hit for the kill meaning you have a  chance to kill them after you hit them a shotgun does  base damage and can still kill assuming you get close enough to have a good hit . On impossible Thin men have  HP so the only thing that will kill in a single hit is a critical shotgun blast.  When you look at damage thresholds youll realize that you can use either weapon depending on how you want to use your assaults. On tech level Once you get better armor assaults can get closer with more survivability.  Once you get better shotguns things die much more quickly at close range.  Rank and abilities are a force multiplier in this case since your average alien will pretty much never withstand two rapid fire shots at close range with the laser tier shotgun or better.  And thats the main selling point No unit can match an ideal assault in raw single target damage without preparation.  Nothing short of a sectopod will survive a point blank rapid fire alloy cannon blast from a max rank assault and the shotgun assault is the only unit that can run in from a screen away to right next to the sectopod and still get amazing critical chances and decent accuracy against it. Lastly your play style.  If you move slowly and cautiously takes things out at long range you will never have a problem on normal difficulty but at higher difficulties your main objective is to never end the turn with a threat in view.  This is because on classic and above the game quits cheating in your favor and all enemies get significantly stronger the longer enemies last the higher chance you have of taking a hit which means the higher your chance of someone dying.  You need to be able to go aggressive when needed to kill that last alien and the assault is the class that facilitates this best because assaults are the only class whos high offensive potential isnt degraded by mobility.  Heavies cant fire rockets or shoot twice after moving snipers either cant fire or gain an accuracy penalty after moving and supports cant even shoot twice offensively this is the aspect of assaults you want most.  Does it carry risk? Yes.  Is that risk larger than allowing the enemy to live? Depends on the situation.It all comes down to risk vs reward There will always be risk when using assaults but the relative reward gets much greater as the game goes on.,Xcom,cf2qjr4,4,t5_2si6x

342940,0,t3_1xyy6d,Well first of all you dont need power if you are concentrating on getting out the satellites. You wont have the money to build anything that will use that power anyway. Basic base power is just enough to build a workshop and an uplink. Second of all while a sat rush is a little easier to accomplish with North America because it gets a little more starting money the strategy sacrifices a lot during the first month in order to have a jumpstart in the second so Africa will make your second month a lot easier at the cost of several bucks in the first.Heres a little guide on how to maximize your chances of success. After the first mission start excavating immediately if the space to the right of the elevator needs excavating. Thats where the workshop will go. Dont buy satellites yet or build anything. Just scan.. On the first abduction mission choose engineers. Then scan until the th.. Start a workshop. By this time excavation will have finished if excavation was needed.. Scan. Hopefully you will have got a UFO by the th. If not you wont have the money for the satellites which sometimes happens. If you get the small UfO really early you can risk skipping it. A medium UFO will follow it shortly granting more loot.. On the th sell all the corpses and some alloyseleriumweapon fragments. Dont be afraid to sell this stuff during the first month  you dont need it yet and the early money is much more important. With the  additional engineers a satellite costs  credits so you need  credits to buy four of them. Buy satellites one at a time remember you can cancel the order at any time and get your money back but you cannot cancel half an order.. Scan until th when the workshop is finished. If you are lucky by that time you will have got a mission. Choose engineers if possible on abductions or credits but you might need to choose whatever else if the panic situation is unfortunate. If you do get more engineers somehow before the workshop is finished cancel the workshop youll get your money back and start building a satellite uplink at once. If not finish the workshop sell what needs to be sold and start an uplink. If you were really unlucky even after selling everything you might not have enough for the uplink. In that case cancel a satellite or restart.By this point you should have the satellites and the uplink arriving on the final day of the month.Note unlucky starts do happen but provided you win all the missions with any luck you usually do have enough for four satellites by April. Four satellites are enough to save all the countries. And a lot of the time by the end of the month you even have some spare credits to start a power generator. If you are really lucky a country you can spare a satellite to will have asked for one granting a bonus  credits.Edit Also while this strategy works and it feels good to save all the countries it does make the first month hellish for your troops. You sacrifice scopes nanofiber vests even medkits. It is debatable whether this is all worth it even if it does make life easier starting with the second month. Personally I like this strategy a lot because restarting during the first month is less of a drag than failing during midgame after investing a lot into the playthrough. But I dont think its an optimal strategy for impossible ironman if you are evaluating the chances of success of a single playthrough.,Xcom,cfgbcw7,5,t5_2si6x

The Greater Good is also a nice one and I have a habit of always capturing the first psionic alien I encounter because of it.Those are good starters but plenty of others add fun and challenge to the game. I think NCE and HP are really up to you. Do you like reliability or are you a gambling man? AC will really teach you to avoid being flanked and plan your own flanks whenever possible. NE keeps the game from getting stale I want the America bonus but the USA only gives me  bucks....shit. TGG forces you to be ready to grab an alien in a nonideal situation.Now note that Ive made it successfully through at least  CI runs and  II runs and I am by no means a hardcore player but the Long War is fucking challenging. XCOM is fantastic in the sense that you can really lose. The last  CI runs I went through I only lost  soldier. My II runs are still a mess but I still lost less that  soldiers in each run. Playing with the AI unshackled Normal mode limits what the aliens are allowed to do and the damage increased makes the lesser difficulties pretty manageable.The most important thing I think I learned is the order in which I do things. Its ok to take a chance but. if you do make sure you plan to cover the gambing soldier and gamble first instead of making the risk the last thing you do. Basically feel free to bet but cover you bets.Good luck Commander D,Xcom,chnoanf,2,t5_2si6x

Its a perfectly good idea to take a  shot in many circumstances. If missing the shot will not result in negative consequences because for example another soldier can kill the alien with a grenade then not taking that  shot because its guaranteed miss is robbing yourself out of a  chance to conserve a resource or gain some other advantage.To actually answer your question my personal rule is to work hard to avoid falling for the gamblers fallacy. Every turn try to reevaluate the situation from a fresh angle. In particular dont get hung up on retrying the same thing over and over again until it works. Taking that lowpercentage shot or risky flank may have been a good idea but if it didnt work then it didnt work try something else or itll get somebody killed.,Xcom,ci8fttk,15,t5_2si6x

1408626,0,t1_cisqmfc,I was thinking in the case of a ridonculous Aim CFOpportunistSentinel Infantry of which I build many. Even at Master Sergeant starting with  Aim they get to something like  natural aim  from perks  from progression. On an uncovered target with no defense thats what it takes to make it worth going from  damage  from VPT plasma stellerator to . So even a target in low cover would need you to get  bonus from somewhere. SCOPE and laser sight would be  or SCOPE and Neural Gunlink would be . I suppose after hes been on  missions with no casualties with your So Others May Live officer that would add up to the  he needs... And I suppose Band of Warriors for another  doesnt hurt but you see the problem. It takes an alignment of the stars to make a plasma battle rifle better than a regular plasma rifle for even the most skilled of Infantry and even then its only just.Its not that theyre not superior in all cases its that the case in which theyre flat superior requires an act of God. It all comes to that break even formula c  .d  .|.|. no light full cover. The . multiplier on the damage dealt is so strong that it pushes the formula into overload as soon as you pick up  damage which can even be done with Ranger and Enhanced Ballistics. Something like reducing the Aim penalties on the higher tech versions would help its case a lot so that c penaltyd always comes out to around  so  for laser  for Gauss  for pulse  for plasma. Or change the numbers based on the low cover breakpoint or high cover one to keep those the same idk. It just seems really silly that its an entire class of weapons whose optimal use is like a shotgun but has worse damage worse crit worse ammo capacity and a mobility penalty. Like sure a high mobility Scout could flank at range with it but in that case why not take the marksman rifle that has the same damage but no mobility penalty and  more Aim and  more Aim if youre not moving? Or if youre doing anything approaching a close flank why not try a shotgun?This is all not to mention potential bugs Ive seen Infantry with Opportunist and  final Aim toting battle and laser battle rifles miss  defense enemies moving in the open but never miss the same shot with a regular rifle.,Xcom,cisun2q,4,t5_2si6x

1448883,0,t1_cixv0af,I think Men in Black  Secret Government Organisation does a disservice as the description of XCOM the filmed series. More like the human drama combat grit and reactivedefensive theme of Season One Battlestar Galactica but on a scale and polish more like the incredibly wellpresented battle scenes of HBOs own Band of Brothers. Frequently suited for the camraderie and sometimes absoloute absurdity of Gen. Kill I see a parallel between the series and a potential XCOM one when troops in contact with a terrifying alien enemy are told by safe home base staff to refrain from using explosives.HBO series commonly follow numerous different viewpoints instead of one hero protagonist which perfectly suits XCOM. The room to write a slew of interesting characters is all there with a  man roster available in canon the Long War experience is going to be a much better fit for a TV series than the standard vanilla  people save the world one. And if people go nuts about George R.R. Martin killing off cast members in GoT holy hell theyd be in for fun with a faithfultosourcematerial XCOM script.The biggest issue I see with it would be all the enemies needing to be CGI. Thats going to either kill the polish or the budget. But everything else is there to work for a series an interesting universe of locations anywhere you want  the base equipment and bad guys XCOM has beautiful art design characters and human drama and disturbing moral dilemmasgrey areas hellooooo MECsGene ModsPsi and of course bucketloads of potential for tense brutal and heartpounding combat sequences.,Xcom,cixw5v0,6,t5_2si6x

1591372,0,t3_2ci806,I rarely use the LMG you sacrifice too much for too little gain.I used a couple LMG gunners successfully in the Friends in Low Places council mission but never used them again.  Not being able to shoot or even suppress after a move is just too heavy a penalty for what the LMG gives you.  I really like the idea of gunners that can actually be effective from further back but IMO the LMGs implementation of the concept leaves a lot to be desired.If there is even a single turn during a mission where you could have shotsuppressedflushedetc with a SAW where you couldnt with an LMG you might as well have brought a SAW.Stick with the SAW and its variants.,Xcom,cjfrhgn,9,t5_2si6x

What you need to have is  squad members and  or  squads in rotation at about this time. The majority of your squads should be corporal or higher rank. Im in july and Im just building the mec and gene labs. Psi is next. You should probably build some labs and workshops to accelerate research and foundry projects.

So first Awesome reloads and Liara the sniper behind the assault fires her pistol causing the zerker to run towards her and triggering close quarters on Captain Awesome. This put the zerker in the perfect position for the rest of my team to drag the zerker back and forth in front of Awesome as he continued to unload his shotgun into the zerker. At the end of it Awesome ended up killing the zerker who had only a little chip damage from the pistols on him. I can only imagine what was going through that zerkers head. AH HA! A vulnerable soldier! Ill just... wait another one over there! But theres one over here so Ill just... No behind me! Yes Ill get that one Or the one behind me here! Clearly the threat.

1900746,0,t3_2gdq8u,Naming your soldiers is such a huge part of the game.  It really makes the engagement with the soldiers so much more intense.  Naming after friends and family can be particularly poignant. I have a policy of name soldiers after viewers and subscribers in my Lets Plays but I am such a softy I cant make myself give their names to the rookies.  I wait until a rookie has made their first promotion before I give them a subscriber name.  I have to say that it actually affects my play though.  With my rookies I take more risks and with named soldiers Im more cautious and reluctant take risks and possibly leave them vulnerable.  And the anguish when one of my really active subs gets killed is real.  XDI think that  is what makes me like it more.  That feeling like every action matters is why I like to name the soldiers. ,Xcom,cki890f,4,t5_2si6x

If you have lvl  mech equip  for  flames per mish or  with pack master! Flame a group kill everyone who doesnt panic and stun the panicked guys while they cant shoot back. Also make high mobility guy into mech so he can make it quickly to flame dist. Marauder and Jaegar are great Goliath works too because he can draw fire and tank it! Theres also  mech item that give u  move each kinetic weapon  uses up one weapon slot though and the other is elerium booster or something but I dont remember when u get them. Im in end game but Ive got a few mechs with move  with both items the aliens never know what hit them well the know they are on fire. Just make sure you check for pods before moving your flamers so u can maneuver to burn as many as possible.Flaming exalt is especially fun as they tend to bunch up nicely on certain missions.

1947686,0,t3_2gzda4,Ive found that it depends on the map. Especially in smaller maps contact management is very important. You dont want to spread out your troops so that they trigger more pods or more pods will patrol into them. For example You have a bunch of  shots you can take you can set up a flank by moving up your assault you have some Suppress options and you can blow up the cover with your rocketeer. Dont take the shots and Suppress at the same turn instead use Suppress defensively use Smoke Grenades Hunker some of your soldiers Steady Weapons and shoot at the aliens next turn. Use rockets as backup. As far as moving frequently there are twothree directions you can take and only one of them will be safe from enemies. In general in small maps I try to minimize the contact I take to be from only one direction so I am safe from flanks. Its only really a problem when you already are taking contact when the map starts any action you take will trigger the pod and you cant do anything about it. This is getting fixed in the next beta as far as I know. ,Xcom,cknwdb5,1,t5_2si6x

They ran out the back alley like hobos.  After that there were more sectoids looting the candy aile in the gas station food mart.  WTF?  Where the abduction in this?

1971448,0,t3_2h7qfr,ill be honest and Ive never watched your videos so I dont quite know what your doing wrong and everything I say is going to be based off what I hear from your situation. first off if your losing  satellites that tells me your rushing the air war too quickly before you can even defend it. in LW you should not go for satellites until you can defend them meaning you should not even build a satellite until you have  interceptors in that continent and at least half of them with laser cannons. theres no point in putting up more satellites up if you cant defend them your just wasting money at that point. because of this though the enemy is going to advance their technology much faster than you can and since your spending money and resource on replacing them your slowing yourself down even more. it becomes a downward spiral to being doomed. as for how to handle berserkers themselves its all about unit formation and team compositions.  the key to taking them down is efficient use of damage. if your not using infantries with high aim with heavy rifles then youll have to get use to it. that extra damage does make a huge difference especially when your taking  shots per turn. also youll want to make sure your bringing at least  assault to each of your missions they are great problem solvers. and with their close combat specialist talent they get multiple shots from it along with close encounter as well. again giving potentially  high damage shots. I feel these  units are almost a must have in every mission regardless the type of mission. units that are situational would probably be medics rocketeers and snipers.so first chuck all your nades and missiles at it first chem grenades will do  damage for every time he moves which is every time he is shot think of it as additional  damage to everyones attack and flash bangs will reduce the distance he can move. Id only suggest using both nades if theres more than  you have to deal with. then shredder rocket only if you have more than  or you do not have a shredder ammo gunnerassault. then move your assault into position such that the berserker will run towards the assault after the first person shoots it usually the gunner if your using it for holo targeting  shredding. this will give your assault a chance to use close combat specialist and also have close encounters as well. allowing the assault to shoot  times or  times and a reload. that alone should do anywhere from  damage from the assault alone depending on how poor his aim is and the damage roulette if you have  assaults do not put them near each other. instead stagger them  such that only  will activate if it takes a reaction shot from close combat specialist. after that just keep shooting away until its dead.  the other factor is your movement how do you move and such. the only time youll want to trigger a pack is right after your first move. so always have a unit that either can move far or would have little use of their second movement scouts and engineers work wonders for this role assaults are also viable as well this unit will now be your point man. also get used to how line of sight works. all units have the same range of sight. if you move your point man and he discovers nothing do not move units further than what he can see. this will guarantee to not trigger additional pods. this also means its ok to leave units out of cover unless they are units that prefer not to move when they shoot snipers Gunners rocketeers and infantries. the reason for this is because you want the enemy to trigger on their turn and not yours. once triggered that means they will use up their turn either moving or overwatching and not shooting unless you have itchy trigger tenticals on. if you do trigger them on your turn with the pointman then you have the full turn minus the pointman to put all your units into the best position possible instead of being potentially flanked and having to panic on how to handle the situations. ,Xcom,ckqrdd8,1,t5_2si6x

2160554,0,t3_2jqpg8,It has been a long time... Last we met it was Iceland a call about whale harvest being infested. We didnt anticipate such an enthusiastic biological weapon. The troops had to fight through infected humans from the moment we hit the LZ.We werent fast enough. I ordered the squad push deeper into the small port town to find only a few more infected inside the buildings one was too far away for the sniper to hit and at first we heard it the crack crack crack of the ribcage and pelvis being split apart. Then sniper saw through the scope an explosion of gore and rotted flesh to reveal a freshly hatched chrysalid Id heard of them in Australia but I didnt anticipate them capable of surviving such cold climates. That was their problem until today. It was much faster than the already wounded Captain Vargas one of my finest soldiers. After a lunge the captain was slumped against a wooden beam in a cabin and thats when we heard the tapping. Tapping sounding like Satan himself was just drumming his black clawed fingers on a desk. A horde of the creatures spewed from the ship first  a rocket to answer them only agitated them then another  from the far end of the dock. No more rockets. No more grenades.They began swarming over the roofs of now trapped soldiers. Before we could regroup  more of the  were dead it was down to our Corporal Douglass and a Red Shirt. As I ordered retreat another freshly burst chrysalid from one of the dead officers rounded the corner that we hadnt swept and killed the Red Shirt while the Corporal was boxed in. At the command center it was silent as their screams echoed in the vaulted ceilings. They knew we were listening.I retired that day... But Im coming back.

2176243,0,t1_clgg4zu,gt Any tips on the optimal way to deal with being flanked or how best to avoid it?Offense is the best defense. The enemies like you have limited movement. Learn their movement radius to avoid being flanked on their turn. If they move up try to flank on your round run and gun with assaults are killer on this. You can also destroy enemy cover with grenades so you can hit them much more easily.gt either by trying to fight them off and getting overwhelmedDont engage in straight up cover fights with aliens. You should try to flank them see above or use your special abilities to control their movementactions. Supression which you can learn on support and heavy soldiers reduces the aim of the enemies and breaks their overwatches so you can move more freely. You can pin down aliens with overwatching so they dont leave cover even if they are flanked.Id recommend taking a look at Zemalfs Enemy Unknown playthrough  He plays on the highest difficulty which is why hes rushing lasers before armor ... see my previous comment with ironman where you cant reload saves. Try to listen to why he is doing things and try to make sense of where he is moving and why. It will help you get the hang of the tactics game.,Xcom,clggbmu,5,t5_2si6x

CM gives your troops the edge rather than aliens having it.IOW one needs to decide what one wants out of the game.  If one wants to feel primarily immersion with occasional but meaningful losses and setbacks but a more relaxed playstyle overall then Cinematic Mode is the thing the devs have designed specifically for that.

This slightly increases the stillsmall chance of seeing members of an unactivated pod upon landing but the alternative is squishing the aliens into a highly restricted space on some maps.That said were currently on e which fixes some of the bugs d introduced so Id suggest going straight for that.Edit A quick tip on this line of thought If you toggle troops with shift and tab you can make them move simultaneously.

2290448,0,t3_2lh6p4,From the Long War stuff dealing with Gene Mods it looks like a lot of things are hardcoded with them so itd probably have a be a pretty extensive mod just to accomplish that seemingly small change.What confuses me is why would you even want something like that? I would say each category has a definitely superior option For brain itd probably be Neural Feedback. Chances are the Neural Damping one will not be enough to really deter the very powerful psionic capability of Sectoid Commanders and Ethereals unless they were already Mindfrayed themselves or something. Neural Feedback puts enemy psi attacks on cooldown and causes damage. The AI doesnt recognize when soldiers have feedback so you could easily do something like go up to an injured Ethereal and have it Mind Control that unit to then instantly die and release control due to feedback. For eyes both are pretty mediocre but Depth Perception is a nice passive buff whereas Hyper Reactive Pupils rely on your actively failing first to be useful. For chest it can depend but so long as your soldiers are not dying often Adrenal Neurosympathy is quite good. Secondary Heart can be a good choice for ironman runs though. For skin Bioelectric Skin is really terrible. Not only is it buggy the range at which it detects enemies is really small meaning youll very rarely ever get useful intel from it. By contrast Mimetic Skin is probably incredibly overpowered. For legs this is the only case where I feel there is an actual choice. Adaptive Bone Marrow is good in the early game when you dont have that great armor as it allows you to heal up from inmission injuries and be back in rotation faster if there is postmission injury time. However once you get better armor the usefulness of ABM drops off. Muscle Fiber Density is great for maneuverability so once you have some decent armor you can switch to this to be able to move in ways that could prevent you getting hurt in the first place.,Xcom,clutdiz,2,t5_2si6x

2406974,0,t3_2mzy28,My current thoughts largely after reading through the comments my medic build thread is that I want two stages of engineers.The first build is sapper gt HEAT gt repair gt scanners but probably stop at SGT. This gets you through HE grenades has a decent antimech solution and can help a lot with early captures. These all get turned shogun although keep one or two until you finish with exalt so dont do any psi training on them. The second build is the smoke build you listed. This is your late game build. They go psi asap. You can start training these up as soon as you get alien grenades unlocked as they can destroy cover fairly reliably without sapper. Medic build always stays the same. At least thats my current plan for the next playthrough.,Xcom,cm97lw7,3,t5_2si6x

2437679,0,t3_2ne7f8,Nice one I will try this out for sure. Im on my first playthrough classic and just got my first base defense in october it took me way to long to capture an outsider so this mission was pretty nasty.  aliens including  mechtoids  cyberdisks  berserkers  chryssalid  heavy floaters  sectoid commanders and a sectopod.If it wasnt for an exploit I found where you can delay the mission seemingly indefinitely!? in the geoscape view by not actively scanning this got me like  hours of a UFO hovering over my HQ without the mission starting before I decided I had a squad that might make it and went for the scan and if I didnt have my elite MSGT Assault with Close Encounters perk that I exploited to the max by running up and down taking free shots over the course of many many turns to finish of the last  or  mechtoids and the sectopod then I would probably have lost the mission. By the way this just cemented my view that this perk is by far the best Assault perk at SGT rank free shots are just OP. Getting  will on top is silly.As it was I lost  of my best soldiers and the Assault that saved the day was down to  hp at the end with the use of a medkit on top so shes gone for  days.The mission would certainly have been doable with less cheese if I could have a little more heat ammomunitions.

A big part of squad composition is covering all the bases and roles that might come up in a given mission HEAT ammo helps cover the antiarmor role where Ranger does not. The real reason I personally like HEAT ammo so much is that cyberdiscs are one of the most deadliest enemies you will face in an entire campaign when they first start showing up.

The rack up kills part is important these troops would get to GSGT quicker which means Danger Zone when they are chopped up. Just leaving them as rocketeers seems kind of pointless they will be worse at overwatch than gunners without gunners huge burst damage vs. mechanicals.The transition to mechanical would happen just at the point where overwatch starts to fall off in the campaign packs of pure heavy floaters Muton Elites.

However you WILL run into shortages in the later months so it is advisable to preferrably trade away corpses as you dont need them as much.Edit Note that in LW you dont want to accept every possible trade offers otherwise the countries will bleed you dry.

You are forced into either keeping your rocketeer out of LOS and hoping enemies rush your front line troops or using the rocketeer as a front line flanker and OW instead of attacking flanked targets.  Lack of defensive talents amp covering fire make this build non viable long term. its ok against sectoids thin men and if positioned right floaters. Beyond that its pointless to use when mutons amp cyberdiscs appear they will swat it like a fly if hes on the front line and they like to shoot and not move while cyberdiscs will just troll you by moving up ignoring the fire.best use is probably as part of a mass overwatch trap but that requires a different play style which i am not fond of.,Xcom,cmzj9gf,2,t5_2si6x

August saw three terror attacks two swarming abductions multiple medium ships attempting to shoot down my satellites and also they attacked my base.

2836113,0,t3_2skyqh,Well for ones name your aircrafts so they can start getting xp. I am not sure why you only have  satellite when you have  uplinks and a nexus. The monthly cost of having interceptors over other continents is going to be cover by the extra funding you get from having satellites over their counties Id say your main focus should be expanding your satellite and interceptor coverage to Africa or Europe to get their bonus. If you are felling ballsy you could go for Asia and try a September base assault on Australia The Asia bonus is the best by far. Getting a few workshops is not a bad idea just be careful where you place them otherwise you will have to build more satellite nexuses to cover the world than you would normally have to.I assume from the pictures that MECs and carapace is ether done or being build. Id say the logical next research steps should be upgrading to gauss and getting the psi lab up and running.Overall your campaign is in a good place you just need to get your coverage expanded both for money more UFO missions and to stop counties from leaving. ,Xcom,cnqgnsl,4,t5_2si6x

The problem is each tier is a very resource heavy cost that can never be refunded.

3011023,0,t1_coa23rr,gtjust think long war could listen to feedback from both skill levels and balance accordinglyDefinitely. Especially since  and this is just my opinion so take it for what you will  the two philosophies behind the mod seem to be in conflict a lot of the time if that makes sense?I mean one of the big ideas behind Long War is making it so much harder right? Theyve stripped out pretty much every advantage that the player has over the aliens with perhaps the exception of squadsight. But at the same time the other big idea of the mod is that you will make mistakes there will be setbacks and failures and thats okay.To me it feels like the two ideas are working in conflict rather than in tandem. Because Im not a hardcore superamazeballs player like the big streamers the games just feels frustrating and meanspirited punishing instead of challenging. Like it wants me to fail.If the base defence mission is anything to go by Im probably not the only one who feels this way. I seem to recall the devs being confused  annoyed by the fact that nobody ever plays past failing that choosing to just restart the campaign instead. And Im just sat there thinking You dont say!Textbook example right there. The willingness to let the player have setbacks failing a base defence is not an automatic game over is at war with the massively increased difficulty the punishment for failing is so severe nobody every bothers continuing afterwards and as a result it seems the game suffers as a whole for it.,Xcom,coa39yk,13,t5_2si6x

Using the train itself for cover.Its more about learning the map. You dash if you know where the pods are from the audio queues.

Your operative is useless theres no easy way to move your squad up to him and the relays can be way too far from each other  extraction point. My plan there is to use scanners early try to creep up the squad to the operative then clear the map by being liberal with explosives.However if the situation turns untenable this is pretty much the only map where I will sacrifice the covert operative to save the squad if needed. Basically dash operative towards extraction while trying to break LoS keep squad back and be ready to extract if more exalt show up around extraction zone than you can kill.General advice have an assault thats at least a LCPL on the steadfastgunslingerhitamprunECsprinter path have a good squad do not fight if more than two exalts are triggered and you dont have a relay close enough.

3159774,0,t3_2waptb,Lowrank rocketeers require a lot of care to use but they pay off massively when they rank up. Youll want to carry Aim items on them like laser sight and SCOPE be sure to steady aim and dont try to move and then shoot. Shoot the rocket near the beginning of the turn so you can compensate if it misses and consider putting the thing you really need to blow up in the middle of the rocket area so you still have a good chance to succeed even with scatter. The hardest thing about Long War Rocketeers is adjusting your expectations of them.About Friends in Low Places Zhang mission  its certainly one of the harder missions in the game but one of the things you learn in Long War is to take your best troops on council missions. This particular mission is best played by staying back in good cover getting Zhang out of sight and using overwatch until all the patrolling pods path into you and get killed off. Then you can advance slowly. If you couldnt win this mission after  tries then you either brought the wrong soldiers the wrong equipment or the wrong tactics.Some specific things you mentionedMiss a critical rocket shot restart or get overwhelmed  You shouldnt fire rockets if you dont have a backup plan for when it misses.out of ammo and cant kill the last enemy with pistols....someone is going to die  Yup! Its XCOM people die. You can let it happen or you can reload saves but you have to pick one.You add more enemies and give us more men but the maps you use werent built for that  Correct. You need to manage your Line of Sight to avoid triggering too many aliens at once. Swarming mission on CQC maps are hard but theyre totally doableYou can never afford to have your men clustered ... because ... thin men  You can hunker carry a medkit use a medkit on someone else or just ignore the acid and fight anyway. Its just one damage per action. Prioritize the biggest threat first. Thin Men are a challenge but they can be beaten.being unable to maneuver tactically properly especially aggressively just adds artificial difficulty because it can be resolved with a restart or a save scum  If your maneuvers are getting you killed then obviously those maneuvers are not proper tactics for the games mechanics. Thats not artificial difficulty. If you dont like being forced to save scum then dont do it. Live with the consequences of your actions.Not to mention the defense changes mean you really have to flank to do anything  You can destroy cover with grenades and rockets you can steady aim in preparation for contact you can use infantry to shoot and then hunker down you can use the holo targeting on scouts you can use Flush to get enemies out of cover you can use volumeoffire tactics to kill an alien with  to hit using multiple soldiers. There are a lot of ways to play besides flanking.A lot of what Ive written will apply to Vanilla Classic as well as Long War. Going from Vanilla Normal to Vanilla Classic is a big step up in difficulty. You need to stay open to evaluating your tactics.,Xcom,copibk1,0,t5_2si6x

3175871,0,t1_cor58jv,Maybe in a single RNG setting but when you start stacking different RNG things on top of each other things change.  So sure over the course of your entire playthrough you might come closer to the mean assuming the vanilla didnt already have enough shots to come within an acceptable variance but that doesnt help when you layer on the RNG of pod placement starting location and pod composition leadernavigators vs bosses vs low resource versions etc.So then the game might be more forgiving so that you can recover from when all this RNG screws you but that doesnt change that there is more total RNG.  At which point it is up to the player to decide which version they like more.  I love all of the new options and complexity that come with LW but there are certain things that I flat out dont like.  One of those is how crazy situations can sometimes get due to everything I already described.  Other things may or may not be directly related to RNG such as the rocketeer and how I feel that scatter is too severe at lower accuracy levels to the point of the rocketeer being a potential liability to the squad along with how the excessive scatter can screw you given the low number of rockets you can bring compared to the original XCOM games.,Xcom,cor6f1d,1,t5_2si6x

Note that you can repair it in the repair bay for very little cost the biggest issue is that there is a downtime for the item while the techs are fixing it up. Its not really one time use perse.Weapons and other nonconsumable items can be damaged if you troop takes a wound out of the mission thats not from fatigue.

3415922,0,t3_2z9rso,I love b. I am pretty new to Long War. Having only started in the last month or so I never got terribly far into b before b came out so I dont know how midlate game WAS balanced. That being said I enjoyed all of the core gameplay changes that were made. I love the new selections of MECs the starting bonuses I like the smarter AI and I think the repair option offers another layer to the game.It seems that nearly every complaint surrounding b is related to the balance of costs versus income but I think the greatest strength of Long War is that you can modify it so easily to suit your needswants. You dont think there are enough weapon fragments? Make enemies drop a little more. You think MECs cost too much? You can change that with a few keystrokes. You hate the new repair mechanic? You can turn it off completely. For me I tweaked how much crashed UFOs could yield raised the min and max yield for alloys and elerium by about  and that was more than sufficient to put alloyselerium in a place where there was enough but not too much. I have also always disliked the coin flip nature of a perfectly setup capture attempt so I put arc thrower chances back to vanilla levels. Those two changes made the game tuned to me and allowed me to appreciate all of the excellent changes made in b.Others have said it better but it important to keep in mind that we are very early in bs life and I think it may be a bit foolhardy to expect the game to be perfectly tunedbalanced right off the bat. Giving up on b and reverting to b is detrimental to bs development. Make your tweaks andor suggestions for how you think the game ought to be balanced and it will almost certainly improve over time.,Xcom,cphn168,1,t5_2si6x

3480758,0,t1_cpou73d,Gotta disagree on Alien Mat gt Xenobio being better in B. Corpses are much easier to trade and you dont want to give up any weapon fragments because of the increase cost or alloys in case you get unlucky with landed ships and Elerium you will still have more then enough to consider trading for request. Alloy plating I can see being more important on impossiblebrutal but honestly if your soldier gets hit before you get decent armor on ib by any floaterthin man in the early game then they are most likely out for ish days anyway and youll have buy more soldiers so youll want to pack lots of flashbangs. Phoenix cannons are still shit imo I got  to test out and put them on my best pilots  kills each to see if its worth using and they just end up taking more damage from ufos since they have to be in the fight longer and they end up not even being able to bring them down to half so the ufos will retreat. Missiles are still better.Sectoid bodies on the other hand I dont care about  for  scientists? Yeah sure I dont care if I dont need to sell them but  fragments for  engineers? No that can delay all my weapon research if I get a bad activation and have start spamming explosives to get out of it and cant make up what I traded. Trading Alloys? Not unless I started in Africa adv gauss weapons takes a looot of alloysI just finished advance gauss classic had  landed terror ship and  landed supply ship and a healthy supply of crashed smallslanded mediums if I didnt get this I wouldnt be able to get enough alloys for the adv gauss weapons for my troops. But the main reason I disagree with not taking xenobio first is because I want the scientists I want to build the  labs early I want my research to be fast and sectoids bodies will always get scientists which I fine so important in the early months and dont have to leave it up to a roll with the other stuff. Engineers will lag behind yes but not so much so that it becomes a hindrance like a lack of scientists can for refences right now I have  and need  for adv gauss weapons.On a side note why are you delaying gauss for so late? Im already getting annoyed with about of DR Im getting with beam weapons and Im only in July. I fought a single mechoid on a crashed medium that was able to withstand all my laser shots even shredded and would have got a flank on someone had I not disabled him.

3556359,0,t3_31123z,I consider that a hard one too. I find the easiest are the relatively open ones with entirely destructible cover in the encoder zone like pizza parlour or boulevard.If at all possible bring a SHIV or a MEC to data recoveries to spend a turn tanking in the encoder zone if necessary. I havent done this one entirely smoothly but based on my mistakes Id say follow brutals advice stay inside and sneak up as far and as fast as you can without activating. Do not try to defend the transmitter instead as you say you just get surrounded  also exalt get more reinforcements and you get less money for succeeding. If exalt start in the encoder zone like the cheating scum they are just go home. assaults is maybe a little heavy unless you have lots of assaults on your roster but I certainly bring . Agree with brutal good on any data recovery map. These are the missions where gunners are optional as you want to be killing rather than suppressing. Although a TSGT or better bullet wizard can be handy. I also find rocketeers to be suboptimal because you dont dare rocket too near the encoder.

If I start Long War B series itll likely be on classic which might not be what people want to see  thats the  reason I didnt do it yet. I have absolutely no interest in playing impossible in beta  due to some of the changes. The biggest disappointment for me is that in beta  all aliens get a damage bonus on impossible to the point where they will be oneshotting your soldiers without crits you need at least  hit points to survive a maximum noncrit from a sectoid  to survive noncrits from floaters and so on. I always strongly disliked that part of vanilla impossible its unfortunate that B went back to instant kills.

3786091,0,t3_33qgls,Beta d Campaign Classic Difficulty with Strict Screening and Commanders Choice. Edited .ini for Faster Air Repair Less EXALT HP and Customized Psi Fatigue. ObservationsIve mentioned before that my Scout builds were  are in significant flux. This is still very true but things are starting to coalesce Concealment In The Zone and Hit and Run all at TSGT make me significantly happier with the Scout  Scouts can now run Concealment for a majority of EXALT missions making them much more attractive than before. Hit and Run and In The Zone both make the Scout spike in power more along the lines of a strong independent class who dont need no coddling like SGT Assaults instead of hopelessly codependent classes like nonMSGT Snipers. Ultimately the Scouts endgame builds still leave a bit to be desired for. Not much has changed once you reach MSGT  Assaults are better at closerange shotgun toting Snipers are better at well sniping and Engineers are better and more flexible at being turnleading consumable mules. Concealment remains the only thing the Scout can do that is demonstrably unique and better than another class and Concealment just doesnt do it for me. I vastly prefer Battle Scanners. Concealments limitations are many especially in combat and the chief downside is that the perk does not allow you to quietly reposition your Scout after they have made contact with inactive enemies. In other words it lets you set up the rest of the squad but you are still committed to that contact if you want to maneuver and I am ridiculously adverse to being pinned down by anything. Like a shark movement is life to my Squad and if I choose to stand still I want it to truly be my choice as with an LMG or nonSnapshot  nonStrike Rifle Sniper. Current Builds still subject to change The InternRole Like a new intern this trooper really has no idea what their focus is going to be but is flexible enough to fill in the gaps of just about any squad while never truly excelling in any single area. HoloTargeting and Battle Scanning combine to allow for the typical earlygame turnleading role while Deadeye and ITZ allow the trooper to cherrytap wounded Drones Seekers and Floaters in an attempt to provide some actioneconomy. This trooper can continue their Master of None flexibility as a Secondary Psi or they can specialize into flanking damage by chopping into a lategame Pathfinder.Armor Tac Armor  Phalanx  Carapace  Aegis  Titan or MECWeapon Marksman Rifle or Tier EquivalentEquipment SCOPE  Damage Item TR Chameleon SuitGene Mod Secondary Heart if not MECPsi If not MEC Secondary Psi  Mindfray Distortion Field Mind MergePerks   Aim  Will  Mob Lightning Reflexes HoloTargeting Deadeye Battle Scanner In The Zone Sprinter Extra Conditioning SkirmisherRole Basically a Pathfinderlite this trooper is designed to provide as much Hit and Run damage as possible while still being survivable emphasizing wide flanks and sowing chaos in the enemy line.

I play aggressive.I build them like this CCS gt Gunslinger gt Rapid Fire gt Killer Instinct gt Sprinter gt Lightening ReflexesSo why are assaults so good?gt Assaults carry shotguns which are the best weapon type. High damage and EXTREME accuracy at close range. Even more accurate than snipers if you think about it. Not many can guarantee high chance to hit when aliens are behind cover or flying.gt Fast and flexible can always adapt to any situation.gt Good HP progression. High mobility. BEST will progression of any class. Access to great small items like breaching and shredder ammo. And if you think about it shotguns actually benefit from scopes more that other weapons  I like scopes on assaults.gt Predictable. You dont have to worry about what will happen as much. Things die or they dont. Not like say an infantry where they miss a lot.gt Good against almost anything. Only really bad against discs and leader mechtoidssectopods solution bring a gunner andor rocketeer andor gauss long rifle along for the fun. Boom done. Breaching ammo is really good against weaker mech. gt When forced to engage at long range say on a roadway or a large UFO just move up aggressively and hunker down. OR gunslinger with rapid fire turns them into a rifleman for convenience! OR use psi abilities!gt So many other handy perks.

Whether its worth it or not isnt really a matter of opinion its pure gains. Whats up to opinion is whether the person doing the rush can handle the severe strain it puts on your tactical game.

I cant think of any single perk that would balance out the disincentive of running all around and into multiple alien packs but we could reward killing aliens as quickly as possible rather than hanging back with overwatch traps or spottersquadsight combos.Adrenal Neurosympathy II  getting a kill within  tiles provides X defense or X DR to allies within  tiles.  Since the new perk will be on early scout and assault trees itll go naturally with shotguns and players can figure out how to get other squad members close enough to get the benefits.Not Actually A Perk  Meld canisters get  turn remaining for every X aliens killed.  Meld is really failing as an incentive for aggressive play right now because its either we can get this canister before contact or during first contact or dont bother not enough time to kill multiple pods.  We need a constant viable incentive to maximize kills per turn and this would also balance out the scenarios where a canister is only three blue moves away on the other side of urban close quarters but there are  aliens in the way.,Xcom,cqwa4rk,6,t5_2si6x

4008519,0,t3_36doht,Im in sort of the same boat as you. Im in June of the nd year and still have yet not been able to capture a sectoid commander. Ive seen a total of maybe  this entire campaign. I dont use Mimic Beacons because I think theyre a cheap way to control aliens. You have two very solid options. I always bring two Psis with me on ops just because I have so many since Neural Gunlink is amazing. Mindfray is amazing. It really is. If you dont have a Bullet Wizard Gunner handy to suppress multiple floaters suppress the ones you can and mindfray the rest. This has a bonus effect of keeping you safe from grenades too.If it helps here is a break down of how I handle Heavy Floater pods. If I have an Engineer with me I toss a smoke grenade. I go with Combat Drugs since Im heavily reliant on psi abilities. Then I break it down to two different ways of handling them. If theyre clustered an I have a Bullet Wizard its a lot easier. Keeping multiple suppressed while having my troops target the most dangerous ones. All of my Medics are combat medics. They have suppression opportunist rapid reaction so they can be on the front line instead of hiding in the back. So that leaves me with three classes with reliable suppression. I Mind Fray and Suppress the first turn and do what damage I can. Then the following turn finish them off as best I can while keeping a couple guys ready for another round of suppression if needed. Also I run my Engineer with Arc Rifle so being able to disable a weapon is really handy too. Especially the pod leaders that do ridiculous damage.Another easier way is if theyre clustered shredder rocket and ITZ sniper just pick off the pod. Ive got a plasma sniper rifle now but it worked pretty well with a pulse sniper rifle too.That being said your results may very since I play with Hidden Potential. Ive got multiple MSGT InfantrySnipers with  aim so on a lot of them I dont even bring aim enhancing items like Neural Gunlink so they dont lose any Will.I suggest Psiing up Infantry too.  Its vary useful for the situations where you KNOW you will not be able to kill the pod that turn so you can end up debuffing two enemies. Mind Fray first then suppress someone else.To make it even more effective my assaults and snipers generally have Psi Inspire as well so along with combat drugs smoke grenades and psi inspire Im hitting  chance to Mind Fray.Hope this helps man. Heavy Floaters are rough. Really rough.,Xcom,crd79lu,1,t5_2si6x

4026636,0,t1_crf5kav,I think some of the cinematics were overlooked by the LW team. Building your first Firestorm I think we just leveled the playing field st MEC gets ready When they equip the suit I think you will be pleased by the resultIn LW there is very little feeling of power in doing either of these things and they dont feel cool. they just feel like a new desperate attempt to catch up. Early MECs are a liability instead of an asset.From a game design point of view there is a reason to build these power spikes and milestones. It keeps the player moving forward and is generally enjoyable. Constant linear progression erodes ones enthusiasm. Grindwalls even more so.I can understand that some people like the feeling of constantly struggling to contain the Alien menace but you gotta give the boys some candy once in a while.Think about Xenonauts X Fury interceptor retardedly powerful late game I win button. Can catch up with any UFO and will shoot an instakill no wreck singularity torpedo with  win rate. While one could argue about the balance of the damn thing IT FEELS GOOD to use it.

4057029,0,t3_370c46,Im in early December have all the air upgrades full Adv Gauss arsenal almost all of the autopsies and interrogations got all captives except Ethereals. Pretty much everything thats not after xenopsionics. No gene mods at all. Researched MEC and thats it was about to build a couple of MECs in late October but this wouldve been a huge waste of resources. Still chopped  guys before realizing that. Have around  meld in store tho.Get Chem grenades and Double TapRapid Fire gunners asap and mechtoids will be a joke. Even two at once. Berserkers arent really a threat shred  chem and zerker pingpong around assaults does the trick pretty easily.My goto in all campaigns has been lasers  carapace asap then air upgrades. Very resource intensive but I kinda didnt feel that due to multiple UFO landings. The  bonus in alloys after researching the alien craft is very good.In November I just gave up Africa cuz those terror missions were a slaughter and not for the aliens. Now aliens have  resources and send an Ethereal every mission  So try not to skip terrors.Elerium  holla holla get dolla. Ive had around a thousand of this thing and sold about  of it. You get around  of Elerium every Large landed assault anyway so heres that. You pretty much need it only for EMP and Plasma if you skip pulse that is which is a longlong way from summer. Dont fear selling some corpses every once in a while. You can also check ufopaedias alien artifacts page where it lists the number of corpses you need for researching and building stuff and plan your sales accordingly.As for MECs after the overnerf its pretty much useless going for them early. Whilst being a really good addition to your team and able to solve problems you wouldntve been able to solve without them theyre pretty much useless until you get at least the second tier of them and all the corresponding equipment railguns proxymines flammenwerfers KMS small items etc. MECI goes to body health with one rarely two shots from mutonheavy floater in October Brutal. At this point your soldiers babysit MECs not them babysitting your biosoldiers.Lasers are just good. While being really crap against destroyers you should have a somewhat decent performance against raiders and fighters and you dont need more than that pretty much until EMPPlasma. As for EMP vs Plasma if you can build a Plasma Cannon do it theyre better against any UFO but Overseer which is longlong way into the campaign and youd probably get Fusion Lances by that time. And if you see a landed UFO even if its a Scout send a good team. Most of the landed Scouts Ive gotten were slaughterbaits for me.  aliens with two mechtoids and disks  mutons  seekers some floaters drones and sectoids to round it up I was happy only one of my guys took body damage.

4069703,0,t1_crjhdgj,This might get a tiny bit complicated.The expected value of the sum of random variables is the sum of the expected values. So the expected amount of meld from n missions is expected amount of meld from  missionn.What is important is the variance of the sum which is variance of meld from  missionnLooking at this you would be right in that randomness does not go down with number of missions however what you are forgetting is that variance does not measure the deviation from the expected value but the SQUARE of the deviation!! The right number to look at would be sqrtvariance also known as the standard deviation. it isstandard deviation of meld from  missionSQRTnSO...the expected value increases like N and the standard deviation increases like SQRTN!!! This means that YES the sum has a larger ABSOLUTE deviation but a smaller RELATIVE deviation.If you have an expected value of  and a deviation of  on the one hand and an expected value of   and a deviation of  on the other oner hand the first deviation is smaller in ABSOLUTE terms but the second one is smaller in RELATIVE terms.BTW you do know that the amount alloyselerium you get from crashed ships is random within a certain range.

4089277,0,t1_crljb0g, I have played LW. I have played original Xcom. Ive probably put about  combined hours into both. This is has been my position on LW mod since day one  Long War is not or everyone is crap. Look I get that you want to have a challenging mod that rewards player perfomance I do. HOWEVER the changes you would need to have a lower difficulty setting is TRIVIAL.Seriously drop out Impossible which has to be curbstop hard for  of people and add Easy which will give you x or whatever of all resources. You dont even need to balance it well at all  just get people used to all the fantastic gameplay elements youve already added. Ive done this in the .ini file already and LW still holds up as a great mod. When your difficulty is based on a few lines of code that give percentage multipliers to stats  youve already created arbitrary divisions of difficulty. Why is MELDRECOVERED  . fictional code example right but MELDRECOVERED . wrong? Yet the that . difference could mean the difference from player going into a death spiral or a recovery.Ive never seen a groupdeveloped mod that is as intentionally inaccessible as LW. Frankly the only reason I think people put up with this is that Xcom at its core is such an incredible game and LW has a solid foundation to build on. And let me be  clear here I love the additional content this mod ads  I just dont know why I have be changed to an arbitrary difficulty.In response to people who say Well if you like it and you can edit the config files why dont you just do that stop complaining and go away? Because I think with a change that is legitimately trivial people who understand the mod who built the mod can make the most balanced change and further can establish a difficulty canon. Did I really beat LW if I give myself x the cash by editing the .ini file? What about x? x? I can guess and if I play  more hours I can probably fine tune it. But the devs already have a knowledge base that I lack and can dial it in with more precision to create a fun and enjoyable LW game for all players.,Xcom,crmeht0,1,t5_2si6x
4094372,0,t1_crmhqo3,Yes I agree BeO is better on a mayhem build.However on a snapshotITZ build LnL is ridiculously good. Even with no extra ammo it will allow you to chain four kills with the GLR  you can potentially reach eight shots a turn though youll rarely be able to set up chains quite that long. On top of that is the added flexibility from being able to reload without ending your turn which in itself is very powerful. The snapshotLnL combo allows the sniper to do something no other ITZer can do going BeO for the crit damage can be done by both Jaegers who have higher base damage to work with and scouts.,Xcom,crmzfe0,1,t5_2si6x

4111266,0,t3_37pe0h,Superheroes. I mean srsly. Wheres the Green Lantern Corps in all this?!I kid I kid.On a serious note though  I like the ideas about vehicles Ive seen thrown around here. Im a sucker for tanks. And attack helicopters. Definitely some attack helicopters.  Im not sure classes need to be done away with but Id like to be able to assign them rather than have them be random.  A third axis on the base construction would be cool. We can dig deeper and deeper into the ground and side to side but not backwards and forwards?  Purely cosmetic but I was not a fan of the sleeveless armor on gene modded troops.  I like the way LW created a reason for needing to use more than just your ATeam every mission. Doesnt have to be exactly the way LW did it but something along those lines would be cool.  Im not sure if it would take away from the feel of the game or be too much to manage in a turn based game but I kind of want a lot more troops on the battlefield.  More than one Skyranger.  A world map thats more than just countries. Id like more of a takeandhold feel to the game. A world map almost like the way Total War games do their campaign maps. The individual battles never felt very strategically important to me.   Air combat felt pretty lackluster but Im not really sure how you could improve it.  I didnt really care for the Meld canisters being on a timer. I favor a playstyle of carefully moving forward and making sure my flanks are secure. I feel like the timer was introduced to try to force the player to move forward more quickly and into unfavorable positions. It felt like a we cant improve the AI so lets coerce the player into making mistakes mentality on the part of the developers.  Above all the one thing I really hope they dont do and always chaps my muscular buttocks when a sequel does this is to take away features we had from expansions in the first game to use as features in expansions for the second game. We had mechs and gene mods in the first game dont take them away for the sequel so you can give them to us in an expansion pack for the sequel. Be creative come up with something new for an expansion. Expansions are supposed to be for improvements and cool ideas that they didnt have while making the game. Not we know they shelled out money for this feature the first time around lets save it for an expansion this time around too!Edit  Also a more realistic rank structure for the troops. Ive really got  colonels running around in my squad? Maybe even separate xp from rank altogether. Let me promote my troops. And only allow one officer per squad. Perhaps Officer can even be its own class.,Xcom,crowrff,5,t5_2si6x

Hopefully theyll invent some cool new toys although I expect gene mods to remain.He mentioned that loot would allow weapon AND SOLDIER upgrades which I thought was intriguing.Im mainly hoping for a system that allows more combinations of choices for soldiers through different mechanics. In EUEW there were  trees on  classes and barely  viable builds per class. In LW there are  trees on  classes and probably  viable builds per class. So that means about  viable soldier types in LW vs maybe  in vanilla.But when Garth says there will be more customisation I hope he doesnt just mean beards and eyepatches kinda cool but whatever but a combination of classes stat boosters perk trees weapon training gene mods psi etc that means soldiers can be as functionally individual as possible.

4342179,0,t3_3aqtq7,Well all stats are drawn from a collective point pool allocated to the totals. Your low will guys will almost always have better aim HP or Mobility. Your  mobility soldiers probably have great aim and your low health units probably have great will. Its all supposed to be balanced so that a soldier has a particular strong suit or is entirely average and thus best suited to a particular role.That being said the minimum values and such for various stats can be tweaked in the DefaultGameCore.ini like most things. Be aware that I believe raising the minimum will also cause the maximum to raise accordingly since you still get the same number of stat points.Also I find will totally overrated. In like  promotions they either hold their own just fine if their starting will was bad or you just have a high will LT stand near them. Low will is only really a rookie problem and one mission fixes it.Edit corrected my comment on stat relativity in the comments below.,Xcom,csf3emi,2,t5_2si6x

4344565,0,t3_3arq7i,Always prioritize satellites. Always. At the start of every month focus on getting a sat. uplink and satellites which also means focus on getting engineers. You get the money you spend back soon enough by having the sats and destroying more UFOs. And get the interceptors to defend them. Always launch the satellites at the end of the month. A few phoenix cannons can help you a lot in terms of taking down UFOs early on but get laser cannons when you can.For which country you place satellites over always consider the continents as well and the same goes for abduction missions. It is far from often that the highest panic level abduction mission is the best one to go on because panic spread continent wise on the  places you dont go to. So say Asia has a country with  panic the one shown on the abduction screen....China for instance and Nigeria shows one with ...the last one is Brazil with . You would think go to Nigeria. However Japan and Indias panic is at  South Africa and Egypt is at . Not you obviously want to go to China instead because if you dont Japan and India will go to  panic while only Nigeria in Africa will go that high. That makes it easier to decide where to launch your limited satellites.For the ground game get lasers then carapace armor. That is enough to make the ground war easy. You generally want to focus on the strategic element instead of the tactical one because you can make up for the worse equipment by playing smartly and a well run strategic game will eventually give you a lot of resources to make the tactical game easy.You can also wait on the base assault till you have titan armor and plasma weapons if you want...just to make it rather easy.,Xcom,csfd3up,7,t5_2si6x

4380955,0,t3_3b78c6,Yeah LMGs are alright but the thing about Squadsight with the LMG is that its buggy. Itll say you have sight on an enemy and should be able to take a shot but a line of sight problem doesnt allow you to fire. So then you gotta move trying to get a better shot and then you have to wait a turn to fire. With snipers having to wait a turn to fire is acceptable since you have infinite range and snipers are usually allowed to steady aim after moving and they usually have better mobility. SAW gunners are pretty much the best. You can move and fire in the same turn and youll have a bit more mobility too. The only situation I can think of where an LMG would shine would be on the graveyard map maps with long clearer lines of sights and when you can effectively get your gunners into spots that will keep line of sight on enemies for multiple turns.,Xcom,csjgwe5,1,t5_2si6x
4384829,0,t1_csjsr5o,Thats be an excellent way to go about it. Adding procedural style missions like that could help you dictate the pace of the game. Take out a cloning facilitynest you see less of that particular enemy for a few missions. Use the same strategy too many times in a row the enemy expects it and sets up an ambush. It could do wonders for the longevity of the game to include a reactionary system that adapts to a players style.  Ugh I wish I knew more about modding.

4499015,0,t1_csxqdvs,It must be as you say then. I always kept my squad together but I guess the maps were just not favorable.Im confident I could reliably deal with a sectoid pod with one grenade and at most three shots. My problem is mostly that I somehow trigger a second pod while dealing with the first. I have to move a soldier to be in grenade range because Im trying to exploit line of sight but thats just far enough to trigger a second pod and now its v. And worse during alien turn a third pod patrolls into my squad.I just keep getting maps where the only full cover available is a line on the wall that grants me vision on both sides a  square wide full cover and I see all of the inside of the building and even on the other side through windows.I tried to circle around the border of the map but that just seems to postpone the problem. I find a pod which retreats inside the building since Im far ouside and attempting to deal with that pod leads me to a window giving full line of sight to the inside of the building.I keep getting maps where it doesnt seem to be possible to manage line of sight. I wish I could get maps like the UFO crashed in a city or the bomb disposal restaurant building with the meat freezer in the back. Those have a lot of full walls and doorways.EDIT Sounds like the trick is to place my squad in the open and overwatch until a pod runs into me. Even better the only cover nearby should be a car. That way they receive shots on their patrol and all retreat to the same cover. Hmm... yah Ill try that.,Xcom,csxr7lj,1,t5_2si6x

4516769,0,t1_cszufux,Theres three main criteria.Have Psionics first if only because the psigrind is real and often the difference between making it to the Temple Ship and getting blocked on your volunteer for months on end until the alien airgame becomes unwinnable because someone decided it was a good idea for UFO stats to be uncapped.Have GSGTs you are willing to part with because soldiers in MECs are going to be carried not by the power of their gear but by their perks. MEC rush is not a thing in Long War because low ranking ungeared MECs are frankly garbage unlike in Vanilla.Have a stockpile of meld because either you get up to T MECs ASAP or you keep leaving the MECs at home because theyre too weak and they never get any XP.This latest run I splurged on genemods early in the year so I had to restockpile meld before I could push out my MECs. I only rolled out my first two MEC suits with four pilots in August but on the other hand they were instantly useful and had a full allotment of defensive items secondary weapons and railguns awaiting him. I upgraded to T MECs by the end of October  it doesnt actually cost very much meld to get to T MECs from T  per suit same as for a pilot and the tech itself is only  meld its all the meldhungry MEC foundry projects that you need for even T MECs to be strong Shaped Armor Advanced Servomotors Jellied Elerium to make flamers useful and MEC Close Combat once you hit fall to make the fist worth its action in terms of damage and to allow for punchbreaches that still leave the MEC with an action to shoot.,Xcom,cszze5c,2,t5_2si6x

Usually Ill bring one supermobile soldier with Tac Vest  SMG for recon meld grab and maybe flanking its rarely reliable due to low dmg and risk. Soldiers with  hp are certainly at risk of being oneshot but you can play around it by drawing fire to others andor hunkering or hiding the lowhp runners. That said I wouldnt put Tac Vests on everyone because I need to have some higher hp soldiers who Im okay with drawing fire to. Only exception is during a recent campaign when I played the  hp South Africa start  then I used Tac Vests almost exclusively which worked out very well for the first two months until I got Phalanx basically.,Xcom,ct0yzwk,2,t5_2si6x

I lost assault on my second UFO I got two in one day too. Though not to outsiders I activated them perfectly and executed them next turn. Just one pesky floater that camped the roof god really awkward flank angle on him. It was last alien too.I presume you didnt have many shotguns since you missed those flanks. You might want to consider bringing quite a number of shotguns on Large landed since they can end outsiders very well.

4710990,0,t3_3fgfto,Build a squad good for besieging and rapid conversion to close range. I usually roll a LMG gunner two infantries a sniper two engineers engi medic and an assault. If you had an extra slot Id recommend a scout or a rocketeer. Overwatch is pretty unforgiving at times and your scouts can get you clear of it faster. Rocketeers are good if youre afraid of cyberdisks and you might want to replace either one of the infantries or an engineer with him.When you first start out find a good defensive position. Ideally youll spawn at the open mouth of the ship but if you dont try to make your way there. Its the easiest way to clear all the pods out as theyll all be coming from roughly the same direction. The cover coming into the mouth is very good usually and the cover the aliens in the ship has is generally poor. Engage at a distance and once youre positive all alien patrols have been removed move into the ship slowly. The outsiders tend to either be in the control room or the opposite end of ship.Good luck.Actually ignore that second paragraph. I thought this was a landed abductor not a supply ship. The same general idea is the same but supply ships tend to be much easier once you get inside. Go heavier on shotguns than you might ordinarily and only try to take close range engagements.,Xcom,ctocxel,1,t5_2si6x

Consider these factors. Onhit status effects like shredding and panic rolls have to be redone.. Low health soldiers are instantly out of the fight you cant try to keep them in because they can no longer rely on cover. Right now a  HP soldier is going to have the same chance to survive a  damage shot as a  HP soldier whereas if the  damage shot was  damage shots they would have a wide gap in survivability. Changes how players use their soldiers and how long fights will play out.. Greater reliability on regular shots would dissuade players from moving into halfcover to make  flanking shots or closer range for grenades. The difference between a  shot and a  is that one of them is a sure thing barring the floating point rounding visual error and sometimes you may want to make a meaningful sacrifice to get that sure thing.,Xcom,ctzc1sj,2,t5_2si6x

Early on HampR is really useful for guerrilla tactics especially when your squad doesnt have the firepower to do large explosive or destructive damage in order to expose or whittle down health. To me the biggest danger of later missions is in the form of  unexpected swarms of pods including the base defense. So my impression was that for general usefulness HampR might be better but in such situations youre at less of a disadvantage.

I always plan out the command breach and start it off with a flash bang. First one was much more lucky because it was in the Navigation room and cause of the flash bang they all hugged the computer and power source which combined with a Rocketeer makes for a some nice explosions power sources do like  damage! and a lack of cover who cares about a Flight Computer and Power core on week .... Then it was just a shooting gallery and eliminating as many as possible and keeping them flanked so they run. That one was pure luck and had much more that couldnt gone badly. They only got a single shot off and it critically wounded someone luckily.The second one.... well... Close Combat Specialist... nuff said.

4867728,0,t3_3hk4mn,Archangel vs Titan. I regularly use  suits of Archangel some exceptions can warrant  but thats later when I can afford to have extra armor sets laying around and Titan or MECsuits on everybody else. Archangel One for my sniper and one for my LMG gunner. Squadsight bonus is relative to height so at maximum flying height you get something like  ish? tiles of squadsight with your LMG. You could also do this with Marskman Scouts especially if they have EC though Im personally not a fan. I wouldnt recommend having more than that unless your entire tactical strategy is going to circulate around a flying squad for some reason. Not that this isnt perfectly viable as well just that it would require you to have dedicated tanks MECs etc. Anyway you may be thinking Well shouldnt I at least save resources and build the cheaper suit Seraph for my sniper whos going to be out of harms way anyway? Theres  reasons for which the answer is no. . That may be true  of the time. But that  only has to happen once and then your favorite sniper is all of a sudden got their names on the memorial. . Im a strong proponent of moving Snipers up. I feel like it is wasted potential to have one less unit synergizing with your squad especially once your troops are all MSGTing up. There is so much destructive potential in buffing a Sniper. With a pulse sniper rifle or marksman rifle you can buff up to  crit with combat drugs and mindmerge for an EXTREMELY devastating ITZ chain. Imagine starting your chain against a unit that has  HP left rather than having to play it safe against one with . Thats the most powerful application but not the only benefit of having your sniper moving with your squad. Your sniper themselves can also use psi skills. Youre not always guaranteed a full ITZ chain so you could take your  or  kills then do something else thats useful like Psi Panic Mind Merge Pyro MC etc. Theres perfect synergy in ending your ITZ chain with Psi Panic or later MC since ideally you will have buffed your Sniper for ITZ on that turn already using Combat Drugs AND mindmerge so now what was once intended for Crit bonus has also given you an immense Will bonus. Iis just... its beautiful. So if that Sniper is wearing Archangel with the flying defense bonus and the additional smoke  defense that HP for worst case  theyre almost perfectly safe from anything terrible ever happening. ,Xcom,cu84474,1,t5_2si6x

Losing one or two highlevel soldiers per month in the mid and late game is faster than the replacement rate. Most players make the extremely reasonable choice of sending their best troops on the hardest missions. If one of those missions go badly and half or more of your best people go down taking their gear with them or at least sending it to the repair bay where it will of course not be repaired in time for the next mission its extremely hard to avoid a downward spiral.,Xcom,culi6he,2,t5_2si6x

5010776,0,t1_cuorf3e,gt Id rather kill one  health enemy every turn with Mayhem instead of two every three turns with Double Tap.Except youre not Prec Shot has a  turn cooldown.Mayhem gives you  Prec Shot in turn   nonprec shot in turn   nonprec shot in turn DT gives you  Prec Shot amp one nonprec shot in turn   nonprec shot in turn   nonprec shots in turn You get more damage in the first turn less in the second and more in the third and more overall damage.More importantly you get way more damage in turn  the entire point of a crit sniper is to assassinate pod leaders and stuff like that and more control on where it goes.  Meaning if that  health enemy actually has  health Double Tap wins.  Or if that  health enemy has  health Double Tap can spread it around and wins again.  And if that  health enemy has  health Double Tap is pretty comparable to Mayhem but you get two shots in turn three for cleanup.gt Especially since that second shot with Double Tap will be more like  damage than  since you wont be getting guaranteed crits.Thats not how averages work.  If were talking a lasertier sniper  damage crits without mayhem the crit chance of your second shot is around  against the same target assuming its hardened and not just in cover.Youll get a guaranteed  damage the first shot and  odds for  or  damage on the second shot for an average of  extra damage.  The average damage of the second shot is always going to be above  of the base precision shot since it has a  chance to do almost the same damage as the original Prec shot minus the bonus for prec shot crits.But even if we conservatively assume half damage because of loss of some of the BEO bonus and ancilliary DR...  from a second shot is still more than  from a mayhem crit.,Xcom,cupzl0d,1,t5_2si6x

A lot of people may have access to it and choose to never ever use it.But at least those people get to make that determination for themselves.At what point is it too much or relevant enough?Is it when you get a unique gun?No because there will be defenders saying that youll get better gear anyway so it doesnt matter.Is it when you get a unique armour? Is it when you get two pieces of unique armour? Three? No because there will be defenders saying that that is just cosmetic anyway so it doesnt matter.Is it when its a unique quest or mission? No no because there will be defenders saying that it wasnt that good of a quest anyway or that it wasnt integral to the main storyline after all.Content is content. The value which you put on individual pieces of content is entirely subjective but if you butcher any part out of a game and uses it to promote a highly questionable and entirely unnecessary practice you are punishing those that will not or can not preorder and make it impossible for them to determine the value of that content at all.And supporting that practice is like shooting yourself in the leg if we refuse to preorder and refuse to incentivize this degenerate behaviour amongst the developers and publishers were not going to get less content were just going to get the same content for everyone and without having to go in blind into purchases.Most developers have already stopped with the different retailers have different preorders insanity that was prevalent a couple of years ago. Why? Because people opposed it and got it across to the developers and publishers how insane it was that to get the full game with all of the content you had to preorder it at up to five different retailers and when faced with that option theyd rather just pirate it. Piracy unequivocally supplied the superior product. Thats insane!We can kill the preorder culture if we try and refuse to engage in their schemes. Even if there will always be peasants and lowlifes that engage in it it can be enough to send a message and to have an effect. Thousands of people are already starting to tell preorders to fuck off and react to this shit and not only when its Deus Ex Humanity Divided levels of idiocy.Dont preorder.,Xcom,cuxs8oz,6,t5_2si6x

5237352,0,t3_3mpu8m,I guess Im in the minority here in thinking that the air game is currently quite good. It rewards correct decisionmaking and planning and has a great amount of room for strategic manipulation what stance do I send on? which pilot do I send? which weapons do I send? as well as rewarding tactical manipulation when do I hit a boost? when do I abort?The only two things which really need to be resolved are Currently some countries are much easier to defend than others because it takes much longer for an Interceptor to fly to a UFO over India for example than one over the USA. This needs to either be changed somehow or it needs to be taken into account by rebalancing it using the starting bonuses and giving better ones to the countries which its hard to defend with Interceptors. Currently pilots get  damage permanently by shooting down a UFO but this leads to your ace pilots having a far higher  chance of destroying a UFO instead of crashing it than your rookie pilots which means you often want to send out a lowkill pilot rather than a highkill one because the lowkill pilot is more likely to get you your desired result. I think the best way to fix this would be the change pilot bonuses based on stance and have pilots gain increased dodge chance instead of increased damage if they get sent on defensive.,Xcom,cvhahh2,2,t5_2si6x

5278896,0,t3_3na7q9,Update explaining the situationIm playing EW Classic here without Ironman.My tactic list is as suchBASIC RULES in and out of combat. Only bluemove outside of combat. No lastyellowmove reveals for me.. I will never EVER take half cover in combat unless absolutely necessary. If so I will automatically hunker down. This was implemented after I killed a Sectoid combo with my Assaults grenade and the single remaining one critkilled her in an instant.. Grenades are my friend.. I dont take shots under  percent.. I hunker down as my default action if I cant take anything else.. I try not to activate more than  pod at a time.For some reason a landed Small Scout was an utter cakewalk All the ayys were holed up in the UFO two Sectoid pods and an Outsider IIRC. I destroyed the Outsiders cover and shot him dead thus triggering the two Sectoid pods. My Sniper got a Sectoid while my Support took down two over two turns and Heavy plus a Rookie got the rest.However abduction missions continue to prove a major pain in the ass for me as I keep losing troopers like flies because of lucky alien crits.What am I missing in particular here?,Xcom,cvmfuio,1,t5_2si6x

For example on SA starts Id often have a sectoid interrogation before doing beam weapons or for sure before precision beam.

5371394,0,t1_cvy7q07,The way I see it is that only landed UFOs are considered traps because any other UFO you shoot down will lose a significant amount of aliens in the crash. So this rules out UFOs that are Scouting Hunting Bombing and the Terror UFOs because they never land. I see trap UFOs as landed Mediums with a crew size comparable to your average Large UFO. Landed Large UFOs going on a Harvest mission could be a trap as well but generally speaking there are a lot of aliens on Large UFOs already that it is hard to distinguish the line between what is normal and what is considered a trap on those type of missions. Some might say  is a trap others might say  is normal by the end game. All I know that it is a fuckton of aliens regardless. ,Xcom,cvy984f,2,t5_2si6x

5718233,0,t1_cx5q2cb,Youre absolutely right that I need to get my air game sorted. I encountered what I assume is a doubleplasma UFO recently and it oneshotted my interceptor. If thats what Im going to face from here on then its a race of global panic vs my ability to get new tech out to counter them! Maybe two months if Im lucky before countries start to bail? Id guess at three or four before everyones panic is in the red depending on where the ayys drop their terror missions...Re tactical... tbh this is my first campaign and I dont want to give up on it after three weeks of play so I restart missions until they work out   Its cheaty but I dont know what Im doing and Id rather play without too many spoilers or a prescribed research order. All I know about Firestorms is from the s and that they still exist in LW! xD  As a result its propping up my strategic game by keeping panic lower than it would otherwise be. Rest assured I actually suck at this game But I guess thats what happens when there is no easy option for newbies P  Next campaign will be honestman I just want to finish one once before I go hardcore on it ,Xcom,cx5wij2,1,t5_2si6x

5751784,0,t1_cx9tdbd,But medics have neither WtS or resilience. You cant say thats okay because theyve got smokes because smoke isnt exclusively a self buff  the suppression rocketeer can be smoked by someone else. Engineers are reasonable but giving them suppression doesnt do a lot to improve their usefulness because they already have plenty of things to do. Its rocketeers that often end up being dead weight on the turn you really need them to help for example because a pod patrolled in and is flanking their position.    What Im trying to address is giving them them a useful yellowmove ability. Suppression is a natural fit because it uses the gun without asking for gun damage it helps control a situation for one turn so you can turn the tables on the next rocket and it wants the same type of position a rocketeer generally wants good midrange unflankable cover with line of sight.,Xcom,cxa2bc9,1,t5_2si6x

5762022,0,t3_3u2ohj,gtI realize that the actual winners of this contest might be ones Im not discussing here namely pathfinders jaegers and even HampR scoutsCorrect The problem with rifle assaults is their low aim progression. Infantry is simply more likely to hit something than rifle assaults. By carrying a shotgun assaults not only mitigate the aim disadvantage but also gain damage output. This in turn is balanced by needing to get closer which is riskier.Your point of about the early game misses context I feel. The strength of infantry early game is the versatility of LeU. Infantry for example have the option of shooting then hunkering which can be very useful to make it through a clusterfucky trench war Im looking at you trainyard!. A rifle assault cant readily to this. For a shothunker combination the rifle assault needs to have a flankedexposed target. Early game when all enemies except lids either use cover or fly and cover destruction isnt always reliable this can be a tough ask. Unless you make a deep flanking run. And in such situations a shotgun is more useful as youre more likely to get the OHKO. That is the strength of the early assault having RnG as a guarantee that something dies.As for crit infantry being a good late game build... Ive never understood this. There is a general agreement that OW infantry tapers off in late game but OW infantry has a higher DPT than crit infantry in most situations so why crit infantry would be good late game is beyond me. Then again I really dont like crit infantry at any stage so what do I know?EditJust so its said I generally prefer HnR over LeU at least from the midgame on when noncover using aliens become more common and its easier to remove cover. LeU is especially good in a prolonged firefight but you dont usually want to be in those situations!Edit I stand corrected regarding aim.Either way the issue of opportunity cost compared to using a shotgun stands. With HnR you are more free to move up closer with a shotgun yielding higher damage. Early game this is often the only option for activating HnR.,Xcom,cxbbz5v,1,t5_2si6x

5878102,0,t1_cxpydy9,About that Airborne targeting... You can target flying enemies without flak ammo. It takes quite some time to find the right spotangle but it works. Might be considered cheating.CD ignores armor no AP ammo interaction. No shredderHolo VPT.The changelog says heat is  dmg with CD. Same with Flak. Ranger should work too. So you are looking at  dmg against airborn robotics which is only enough to kill seekers from the third year on.CD and KSM interact with Heat ammo not warheads. Warheads is only for grenadesminesrockets.I just started using shogun and I think they are alright. Heat ammoRF are the important perks. CD is good utility but not really important. They dont get much aim so I would not suggest them until battle computers are available. They profit a lot from mobility so to me they seem to be much better in the late game than with MEC . If I read Sectopod in the Hyperwave screen I instantly feel happy. It is very rewarding to almost solo it with the Shogun.,Xcom,cxq5g81,2,t5_2si6x

5900244,0,t3_3w1bvt,I also use Packmaster as my SPEC perk for Engineers.  I considered Smoke Grenade at LCPL to be too strong with that though so I swapped it with Battle Scanner.  I know some people would say that BS is even stronger but between the free action and getting  free smokes I considered that to be more OP that early than some free intel.I also would recommend Low Profile instead of Will to Survive.  Engineers cant afford item slots to stack armor so Will to Survive is basically just . HP since they realistically cant usually take more than one shot and survive especially if they are near the front.  I found Low Profile to be more useful because it keeps them from getting shot at all and if they go suppression they can take any cover and have the full defense bonus while suppressing.Love the overall tree it looks great and Ill be trying it out when I get a chance!,Xcom,cxt20ea,2,t5_2si6x

They should be allowed to make mistakes without being severely punished during the early stages of the game but be encouraged to develop the skills to tackle on the more difficult challenges that the game will provide later on. As uErinBE described in the thread about HP pools giving rookies  health in comparison to an ADVENT troopers  at the start of EasyNormal allows new players to make early mistakes and learn from them instead of making early mistakes and ending with one or more soldiers short unlike in XCOM UFO DefenseUFO Enemy Unknown soldiers are not expendable schmucks in that individual soldiers are both more useful and more expensive so low manpower is much more crippling.,Xcom,cxxesyx,1,t5_2si6x

Its worth noting that defense is less of a get hit less stat and more of a draw less aggro stat  aliens shoot at whoever is the easiest to hit so even  extra defense means a soldier will often be ignored in favor of another target.LW MEC stats work differently.  A soldier turned into a MEC will be reset to strictscreening stats with additional levelup stats determined entirely by the MEC class.  Some MEC classes are useful at low ranks Pathfinder Valkyrie while others have optimal builds that dont really come together until very high ranks Goliaths.,Xcom,cy7jeav,3,t5_2si6x

Are you supposed to know the game better than him?As far as the whole XCOM is for children farce... I notice you completely ignored the question I posed. Saving Private Ryan is rated MA. Is this a childrens film in your mind? Because most people with some sense would see it as a dark and mature film primarily marketed towards adults which some teenagers who are older than  are permitted to watch.

6089140,0,t3_3yxd9y,The trick to this mission is that the Thin Men spawns trigger on both your movement and Zhangs so youll want to spend about rds or more of your turns just static overwatching and shooting whatever survives preferably without moving to do it to keep the dropins from flooding you. When you do move try to bluemove for the most part to keep up the overwatch perpetually. For these reasons I use a bunch of overwatch specd infantry and holoshred LMG gunners to wipe out whatever survives the overwatch. A SHIV isnt a bad idea either because the thinmint AI loves to spit acid at them for pretty much no benefit.In your first turn youll want to move to hug the leftmost corner of the map left from the perspective of your spawn facing towards the extraction zone that is and slowly blue moveoverwatchcampcampblue moveoverwatchcampcamp along the elevated area that hugs the left border of the map.

It may take some middle ground to have militia provoke Ayys to cover but not count as combatants proper.  Itll be so much easier than modding EU at least.  The issue with having them controllable at start is then they should provoke alien activation.  Which basically activates most on the map.  Hm.

6231371,0,t3_40wzbj,Look at it this way.Irregular guerilla warfare has been the means of choice when smaller forces have had to fight against greater numbers throughout the whole of history. Even Sun Tzu talks about it.The beliefs of the average fellow whilst relevant arent necessarily truthful. This means that its possible for the average person to hold false beliefs. Which means that even if a large group of people hold a certain belief its still possible for that belief to be false. Said belief does not become true simply by virtue of the fact that its believed.The Advent troopers arent humans but alien hybrids created using alien tech whats more.You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but you cant fool all of the people all of the time.Now if you brought ethics into the situation I dont think its possible to condemn XCOM in the slightest. XCOM arent the ones doing the abominations thats Advent. Compare disappearing a load of people vs rescuing them. Last but not least I think Che said in his autobiography that propaganda and misinformation were the two greatest enemies of any guerilla movement. Primarily because the guerillas dont have a platform for telling others what theyre really about  They have to operate from the shadows. So some civilians see the guerilla movement as bad because the regime tells them so. Same with Advent propaganda. To a large extent XCOM are justified by the fact that in a hypothetical situation if you were to sit a brainwashed citizen down and explain what was really going on they would say the aliens were the bad guys. So it can be said that XCOM are operating in the interests of all humanity brainwashed or no even though some of them  even the great majority of them  are unaware of that. This is just a collection of thoughts on the subject. I dont think it would be possible for anyone with humanitys interests at heart to condemn the actions of XCOM in XCOM.

6233464,0,t1_cyy5jws,I dont see sharpshooters and rangers as overpowered or necessary.  From what Ive seen mostly from beagle the most necessary class is the grenadier and then the specialist.  I dont think that you dramatically weaken your chances by not using swords honestly you may improve them by not using them but I like them because they add a third role to assaults besides the rifle and shotgun.  Pistols I see as very useful because so many missions have a turn timer on them that makes it difficult without serious planning to use a sniper rifle because you have to move a lot to reach the objective.  However if you can get your sniper into position cone of fire snipers can be ridiculously powerful against pod activations.In the end it all comes down to preference.  If you dont want to use pistols and swords dont use them.  There are ways of using the two classes that dont rely on those weapons while being equally viable.  If you think those weapons are overpowered but still want to use them use ini edits to lower their damage by  or lower their aim or alter the skills that use the skills or a combination.

Whereas aim gives you  aim but only for the first shot of the turn.So aim is better for hitting a single shot. Steady hands is better for a serial run.You could build a hybrid that has something like deadeye DfA faceoff aim fan fire. Or variations thereon. Thereby retaining some of the key gunslinger perks but also letting you act as a true sniper hitting single targets hard from far away. ,Xcom,cz2nu3b,2,t5_2si6x

I normally brought x double tap sniper and as soon as an enemy activated I just shot  times and everything was dead with  accuracy shots. No need to move forward no need to destroy cover or anything everything is just dead  at least except for sectopods but I had disabling shot for that and ITZ is obviously not very useful there regardless.,Xcom,cz2sbjf,1,t5_2si6x

I never destroy the Hyperwave Relay.  You might be able to get away with Plasma if you can rush your Firestorm.  It took about  seconds for my EMP Firestorm to take down the Overseer in April on Normal.    I just do it ASAP.  I find that EXALT Rocketeers are my least favourite enemies due to their tendency to screw your positioning over and kill your favourite soldiers only second to Ethereals.  Plus you get some nice one of a kind loot.  Ive been averaging May myself but I also spend a lot of time researching things I dont really need to instead of progressing the tech tree as suggested.  Regarding the Elerium shortage You probably shouldnt research everything in the Foundry ASAP.

The  thing I havent tried yet that Im doubtful of is disabling autosaves in EW I occasionally experienced similar crashes that were directly caused by the game saving. IE if I alttabbed or made an action after starting a save but before it finishes I get the same crash.  Another ?possible? but unlikely fix is something that one particular user has been posting in every steam forum post and he seems quite certain it works.  He claims that when he played EU and EW the crashes were not exclusive between them and that if youre experiencing EW crashes the solution is the launch EU force it to crash then launch EW afterward.  He currently claims that this is the fix to XCOM  crashes as well I dont believe this will do literally anything but waste my time but Ill give it a go because Ive exhausted most everything else Ill comment back here if it somehow works.,Xcom,czq8ty3,3,t5_2si6x

A research in the management layer would be OP since its only in particular cases that you need extra turns and so all the other missions youll have way too much time and not enough pressure. Your killing all enemies idea is better I think but often the enemy drops down between you and the evac so you need the extra turns to kill them and usually because of their placement if you kill them all youre rarely more than one turn away from evac.,Xcom,czqp4ln,49,t5_2si6x

6500091,0,t1_czrks1u,Pokemon is legit as a lightweight RPG which is why its on handhelds but beyond that  I used to mess around the online unofficial competitive versions  Pokebattle I think. Theres something else now. It was surprisingly popular at the time with a few thousand people on at any given moment  and there was a ton of depth to the multiplayer when you were competing in ranked ladders.  The concepts of meta offmeta counterpicking tempo and various styles of team comps Stalls combos low tier trick comps etc all existed.  I mean I havent played anything Pokemon related in  years but just because you personally dislike something doesnt make it bad.  Also the lack of depth comment is wildly inaccurate  as someone who knew very little about Pokemon trying to play in a competitive format was about a daunting as trying to get into a MOBA due to the sheer variety of teams and strategies which were viable.,Xcom,czrnpon,1,t5_2si6x

Somewhat like how its done in older games with some enemies being weak to lasers while others are weak to projectile weapons or having certain enemies be particularly weak to fire or acid and difficult to deal with otherwise.My strategy with the Chyrsallids was to just take the first hit.

The sword route for Rangers is a fantasy that I want to invest in and live out having this badass running around chopping things up but the payoff just isnt there. By playing around sword traits it feels like Im heavily gimping my characters strength.Instead of straight up buffs to the sword though I think rebalancing the Blademaster skill would be more immersive.Right now  sword damage vs phantom is a joke. If that sword perk were  damage X crit X aim on sword attacks then It might be worth taking. I would imagine that a Blademaster would be more significantly better at hitting vitals on an enemy than someone flailing with a machete. ,Xcom,czsdemg,2,t5_2si6x

6507432,0,t3_44rv0b,I have a few I can offer in no particular orderBefore taking an action always try to consider what the outcome could be and if your willing to accept that outcome or have a plan to deal with it. Before you move to flank an alien is there the possibility that you might activate another pod Before you take that  hail marry shot is there another course of action you could take to make better use of that soldier. I often spend a lot of time just staring at the battle field before I make my first move and I generally have a pretty good idea of what Im going to try to accomplish that turn how Im going to do it and if the plan is a bit dicey how Im going to recover or mitigate the results of failure which is a nice lead in to my next point.Guaranteed damage sources are your friend. Grenades Stocks certain class abilities. Keep these in reserve and use them to guarantee a kill you might not otherwise get.Counter to my last point however if a grenade can remove an aliens cover and allow you to end what would otherwise be a protracted fire fight which Xcom will almost always lose then its better to do that earlier in the turn then later.High cover is your friend and partner that will see you through thick and thin. Half cover is a fickle tempress who will entice you with promises of glory and then leave you hanging when the aliens come to cash your check. Unless you have a very good reason and know the solider wont be under heavy return fire the next turn avoid at all costs.If the ground does not favor you and does favor the enemy consider pulling back to a more defensible position and force the enemy to take the cover you just abandoned this obviously really only works on missions without a time limitIf a mission is starting to go bad given honest consideration to an evac if the mission allows for it. As long as your not to spread out you can evac instantly and your campaign can survive a failed mission or two. Its a lot harder to come back from a squad wipe. Its real easy to develop sunk cost fallacy on a mission especially where someone has already died but dont let that make a bad situation worse.If you see an enemy on top of a building thats free damage! Toss a grenade at them. The grenade will deal damage and destroy the floor under their feet causing them to fall and take even more damage. Warning The aliens know this as well and the ones who can will use it against you. I lost a member of my squad because I figured the alien wouldnt recognize this opportunity and wouldnt use a grenade to kill a single soldier.If your like me and havent looked up all the aliens and what their abilities are then make sure you give them lots and lots of space until you know what they do. Nothing is worse then moving in against an unknown only to find out it does something you werent expecting and lose a soldier to it. That being said if you can kill it before ever finding out what it does that is generally for the best as well In the missions where you start concealed and have a time limit Blue move then dash from cover to cover until you make contact with the enemy. This dashing will save you precious time you can later spend to deal with sticky situations. Its a lot easier to deal with an unexpected problem if you know youve got an extra turn or two to do so. Also on these same missions dont waste time trying to set up the perfect ambush. Get people in a decent position preferably up high and behind good cover use your good opener abilities kill zone salvo and grenades for instance roll over them and keep moving. That timer is ticking and you cant afford to waste a turn trying to entice the enemy into that perfect trap.This one will cause some contention but IMHO swords are next to useless. They have their time and place especially before run and gun but in general a shot gun will deal more damage with higher accuracy and a better crit rate then a sword will and you can position a solider so that even if you do happen to miss with the shotgun he isnt going to get murderized by the same alien he just tried and failed to kill like they will with a sword.If youve got lots and lots of resources then focus your research on weapons over armor because a dead alien cant hurt you and better weapons ensure you can make sure this happens. However if your resource tight armor is better to start with because weapons need a heavier investment for fewer soldiers ie you need to research and build the riles before you research and build the sniper where as all soldiers can benefit from armor regardless of their class. The research does you no good if you cant afford what it offers after allThe mimic beacon is a great tool get it early and always take at least one on a mission. Use it when you pull that extra pod or your fail to kill that super dangerous enemy. It will draw a lot of fire off of your squad and give you the chance to recover with less injury and death then it would have taken otherwise.Dont forget to manage your engineers. Youd be surprised just how much they can help you if you handle them properly. Got a key solider with a boo boo? Get an engineer in your AWS and cut their healing time in half. Soon as that soldier is all better pull them out of there and get them helping out in the engineering room name escapes me atm but the one where you build experimental weapons and armor or get them down helping to dig out that debris. That debris is a good source of resources early game so dont ignore it just because you dont need the space yet.All I can think of for now and my lunch break at work is almost over  If I think of more Ill post em later.,Xcom,czsf1uw,6,t5_2si6x

Believe I ended the game with an incineration bomb two plasma nades and a shredstorm still available just due to how conservatively I ended up playing it and how ineffectual they are at killing You Know Whats due to that freaking teleport. Legitimately though the shredstorm is absolutely and delightfully unbalanced as it allows you to mow down literal hordes of enemies with guaranteed damage while not only removing their armor but their cover as well.

6508523,0,t3_44sdrn,Im only on commander so maybe it is way worse. I had a useful gunslinger early game. He was especially deadly when I first unlocked mag weapons. But yeah armor started killing the usefulness real quick by the time I could get killzone I was respeccing my gunslingers. Lightning hands I kept for a while though it took some time before I had enough base aim to make deadeye worthwhile a free attack is a free attack even if its only going to do a couple points of damage. I would be so dead without medics maybe Im just bad. Haywire is too clutch to not get though. A combat hacker with just medical protocol and field medic is what I am usually bringing now in the late game. The second sword was awesome that stun was so helpful I am really sad it got replaced with the burn affect. Ive kept one ranger who has all sword skills. Every now and then she gets to go reaper crazy and decimates a pod but the shotgun is almost always the better choice to kill a single enemy. The autocounter has also caused some serious killing sprees for me but also was better with the stun sword. ,Xcom,czsj4i4,2,t5_2si6x

6513531,0,t3_44ujkx,I think a lot of this is just needing to get used to the game. After a complete run through of Commander Mode I only ever had ended up leaving one soldier behind due to time constraints. I think  turns is plenty to do the objectives or  for VIP extraction.A few things I tend to stick to when playing... I never take longer than  turns to start the first engagement. I use a Phantom Ranger to seek something out and as long as Im not pulling two pods take the fight and move on asap. VIP Extraction doesnt mean you need to kill everything on the way. Take the most efficient route. Use elevation as much as possible go around turrets dont stick around for reinforcements I.E just book it if you got  turns left and reinforcements are coming they wont get an attack in before the end of the op if you evac. In fact unless an enemy is overwatch trapping you you should only be running for the evac zone on the last turn. If they are overwatch trapping have someone take the hit OR use a single action move if they can also make it to evac. Retaliation mission enemies typically dont engage civvys when you are shooting at them. You can game the retaliation timer until there are just enough civvys left then engage the last pod. Take your time on these scout first. Guerilla ops objectives need to be completed within the timer this doesnt mean you need to kill everything first. Just make sure you have a specialist with a line of sight on the objective when the timer is at  turn left. You can then play as slow as you want to kill anything left.I found this game doesnt exactly get any easier down the line. Its always challenging.,Xcom,czt1t3h,1,t5_2si6x

6555102,0,t1_czxatk0,gtI dont think you want to make the game easier or cheated to do so I never even implied that. I think you did unintentionally and now are acting like its basically the same when it really isnt. Which isnt cheating or exploiting or anything its just trying to justify it as the same when it isnt quite that.This is essentially the same thing though. Youre saying that Im either through my own ignorance or through deliberate dishonesty attempting to play off these differences as irrelevant purely to inflate my own ego and have people respect me more or respect my campaign as some kind of legit achievement. These are things I couldnt care less about.gtA sectoid being less threatening is true but with  hp it takes typically  hits to kill or with rangers sometimes could die in  hit I believe at  hp. Youre a bit more reliant on crits to kill a  hp one over an  hp one very quickly. So they take a bit more devotion to get down before they actually hit the point of being a risk.As I said this is true if youre in a finetuned and very dangerous campaign where every shot is life or death. In vanillas balance this is one more easy shot landed on an enemy whose cover has been completely destroyed and didnt do anything worthwhile in his first turn anyway. Its irrelevant. I cant say this any clearer to you you either believe Im being honest with you or you dont  its truly irrelevant in the context of vanillas balance when were discussing this kind of play.gtI looked at your other hp differences and I think the things like Lancers Sectoids and Faceless certainly could add up to making it easier to snowball since it only takes one bad situation where the hp didnt hit zero to hinder the snowball even a bit.Again  it does in a finely balanced campaign that is very close to victory or defeat. In a campaign the player is firmly in control of it does little to nothing.gtIf changing the hp had no impact on the difficulty why ever bother doing it?As I said  Id imagine these are changes aimed at tweaking the Legend difficulty for the average player choosing it. These are not wide sweeping changes designed to completely fix a glaring overpowered strategy like Grenadier abuse. They werent made for that purpose which is clear when time and again I have to refer to how irrelevant they are to this discussion.gt But I do think youre kinda brushing it off as nothing when it isnt nearly as irrelevant as youre kind of letting on.I dont want to take offense but the more you imply Im not letting on my honest feelings the more I feel like youre either not listening to what Im saying or you are simply convinced Im too caught up in my own ego to seperate fact from fantasy.Im not lying to you or failing to let on the significance of any change for any ulterior motive. These are my honest feelings and thoughts. Believe them dont believe them  thats your call and you can decide what you think of my honesty yourself.,Xcom,czxcn3t,4,t5_2si6x

6560097,0,t3_45h94s,People get all up in arms about save scumming but if youre on your first playthrough of an xcom game ever I think it can be helpful.  Theres a lot of stuff that can just completely wreck you if you dont know what to be prepared for and honestly just having to eat the cost of that can make certain people just give up.Try to keep people in cover and far enough away from enemies that they cant flank your units on their turn.  Try to take away their cover grenades certain abilities and blowing up explosive objects cars gas tanks etc will do this prior to having anyone shoot them and of course try to flank them without getting any one unit too far separated from the herd.If you mess up too badly or get hit with something you werent expecting just reload.  You can always do another playthrough after you get the feel of the game down where you dont reload saves mid fight if thats your jam.  If you think you have a perfect setup and then you get just destroyed on the Alien Turn reload your last save and try to figure out why you got messed up.  Did they have a big AoE attack that you didnt expect?  Now you know they have that so you can keep your units more spread out and away from other explosive objects.  You will also know for future encounters with that enemy so in the future you may not have to reload.Also the meta stuff is really important.  Try to focus on getting weaponarmor upgrades as early as you reasonably can.  Having your weapons do a few more points of damage or having a couple more hit points on each unit can often make a huge difference.,Xcom,czxv9ui,6,t5_2si6x

A fun tool to play around on lower difficulties for sure and a cool backup when your abilities are on cooldown or you need to finish off something in earlygame.

6571946,0,t3_45j7ag,My usual setup on commander GTX in one corner and dig dig AWC in other corner Power.  Comms is next on one side followed by a workshop nd level middle so I can use an engineer for both more power and staff the comms. Expand the contact network to get in range of multiple facilities so when my avatar counter hits the final countdown Im ready for it. proving grounds also connected to the workshop rd level I go for more power shadow chamber psi labs or turret defense building for when the ufo comes. Research wise I go for armour before weapons as they are much cheaper to get supply wise thus allowing for more buildings. And grenades compensate well enough for early game damage. By the time I HAVE to do the blacksite as my first avatar decreaser I will have at least squadsize I mag weapons and predator armour as well as a mimic beacon. When expanding I also tend to build quite some radio towers to keep the intel costs down and secure a larger income for the later game. This leaves me with intel to spare on extra engineers and goodies at the black market. Rushing a long tech like mag weapons or predator armour is also very useful. With the proving grounds early on I tend to get at least  kinds of ammo preferably  if I have the cores to spare as well as  special grenades  and hope for at least  acid  but upgrading med kits and plasma grenades are the highest priorities. Mid game proving grounds I try to get my talon rounds for my shotgunner or barring that at least AP rounds. If I get tracers they tend to go on my grenadiers so they can actually hit a broad side of a barn properly.

Especially since things like Sectopods and Andromedons are almost always the first units from the pod to be shot by overwatch when popping the pod unless you dont have line of sight to them. It also helps that after they are active they move before the others sectopods at least do.Hair triggers are also a very nice upgrade for them but between getting a chance at a second shot that could miss or outright killing a unit Ill take the latter.

6588407,0,t1_d00rs4p,Theres also the fact that if you cant flank an enemy or destroy his cover an overwatch shot with a penalty is usually more accurate than a normal shot through high cover. I think your chance to hit an enemy through high cover has to be higher than  for the shot to be more accurate than the overwatch x. lt x where x is the percentage to hit an enemy in high cover let me know if I had the wrong formula.

6588926,0,t3_45wmur,The sniper is a tricky beast in xcom.  Much like in EU squaddie snipers lose out on mobile damage and dont have much else to recommend them.  I tend to leave them at home for the first guerrilla ops and VIP extraction mission especially the VIP mission training up another rookie gives you a grenade on the front lines.That said snipers pick up in usefulness in the early mid game once a few other things fall into place.Scopes  Probably the   thing into making an early game sniper useful.  Snipers are only useful for shooting stuff with their squadsight better aim progression and and tendency to use height bonuses.  The scope doesnt just add  aim at all times it also adds an additional  aim to enemies that dont get a cover bonus!  How soon I get a scope or a PCS Perception is going to affect how quickly I start fielding a sniper regularly.Phantom rangers  Really boost the utility of snipers.  Particularly on supply raids and guerrilla ops.  Im way happier bringing any kind of sniper when I know Ive got a phantom ranger to scout.  Especially with Long Watch.  Once the main squad is revealed you can get long watch to shoot any patrolling enemies your phantom can see.  This is sometimes hard to do since enemies often dont want to patrol but on alien retaliation they always want to patrol looking for civs to kill.Lightning Hands  mag pistol  This is a nice power spike and makes snipers not such a liability on VIPCouncil missions.Proving ground  Snipers love the proving ground.  They love taking specialty ammo instead of grenades.  They love spider suits.  Spider suits  death from above lets snipers do some sick shit.  Like grapple execute someone with a height bonused sniper shot then use lightning hands  a second pistol shot all with height bonuses.

6606988,0,t1_d02jn0n,I think what would help is if different enemies responded to mimic beacons differently. In that way it could be designed so that mimic beacons are still useful tools for when youre starting out and learning the game or in a more vulnerable position but against more clever enemies lategame or enemies with sensor technologies theyd be less effective. This could also be tweaked with difficult too and might be more tunable than blanket behavioral changes. ,Xcom,d02pv18,3,t5_2si6x
6607388,0,t1_d02n70w,Ive noticed the same thing. First things I usually spend supplies on are a single Flashbang and a single Medikit but the Flashbang only sees use until I get my first Mimic Beacon. After youve killed enough Facelesses to forge your sacred Mimic Beacons Flashbangs are phazed out almost immediately. Smoke Grenades are just bad  too insignificant of an effect for too small of a radius. The too small of a radius thing is amplified especially when XCOM  so much incentivizes spreading out with Snipers Gunslingers and Rangers especially with Phantom all acting separately from the rest of your troops and sometimes Specialists or Grenadiers rushing into a good hackingbombing position.Id really appreciate upgraded versions of Flashbangs and Smoke Grenades rolling out shortly after Mimic Beacons likely alongside a Mimic nerf too like what EW did with Ghost Grenades making Smokes not fall out of relevancy anymore. ,Xcom,d02rct6,4,t5_2si6x

6608460,0,t3_463qhm,Superhero Squads could be fixed with the following Fatigue see LW. However Fatigue should not be scaled off of turns in mission. Keep it simple. If youre familiar with the BattleTech Tabletop there was an optional rule in StratOps that incurred penalties as missions lasted beyond Xnumber of turns. Long story short it was a nightmare to keep track of really annoying to use and thus was never used. If you want to create risk for spending more time in mission use the reinforcement mechanic! The reinforcing pods are badass! They need to be used  more. Think about how dangerous exploring the map would be if Heavy ADVENT MECs were being dropped on your head every  turns. It would also be a fun see cruel and painful way to counter creeping overwatch strategies. Second Waves Not Created Equally and Hidden Potential when combined with Fatigue will keep us searching for the best of the best. Allow max rank troopers to evenly distribute the XP they earn among all troopers not of max rank that experience should count for something. Adjust the endgame missions to require more than one squad. What if there were three missions after the point of no return and you couldnt use the same soldiers to complete all three missions? This is my own idea to add onto the pile InfamousWanted Soldiers. Those news holograms in game I thought it was pretty friggin neat MY IMMERSION that your soldiers portraits popped up on them from time to time. That got me cooking what if there were a system devised that tracked soldier performance damage dealt total number of kills average kills per mission number of successfulflawless missions so on. If a soldier were identified by that system as being particularly successful then ADVENT would throw him up as one of their most wanted as indicated by the fancy hologram news tickers maybe with a big red WANTED pasted over top of the portrait. One of ADVENTs Most Wanted goes on a mission? Random Dark Event triggers an extra number of pods show up on map the squad starts outside of concealment a special pod reinforces specifically designed to capturekill the wanted soldier some adverse conditions. If ADVENT successfully captureskills Most Wanted more bad stuff happens. Most Wanted deceases each time a soldier sits out on a mission eventually goes back to just being a normal fugitive. Now Im about as code literate as a newborn babe but its a good idea right?gt There is a spectrum between mission success and failureI feel this is something that could be better utilized in XCOM . We have the lovely mechanic to call in an extraction any time we want. We need some no win scenarios to allow us to experience acceptable losses retreats to conserve losses etc. The deliberate application of escalating enemy reinforcements should also be used to emphasize the whole time to GTFO mentality.gt Small resource and intel nodes dot the tactical mapFear not my good XCOMer! Meld or something similar will return and with it the endless ET ambushes that I stumble into in the name of progress. Alternatively increasing pod size as well as the number of possible timed drops on map would encourage map clearing but provide an appropriate risk in doing so how badly do you want to fight that pod of six ADVENT troopers . . . .gt Research does not take timeYour minds in the right place but I think the same effect could be achieved by increasing the resource costs on TT weapons add Elerium Cores to the build requirements andor requiring TT weapons be built in the Proving Grounds after theyve been researched. If Elerium Cores were added to the list of required resources players would be encouraged to secure their timed loot. If more timed loot were droppedhidden across the map players would spend more time searching for timed loot.,Xcom,d02vcv5,1,t5_2si6x

6613372,0,t1_d037ysq,I found the Chryssalids annoying until I started remembering to use my Specialists scan ability moreaggressively battle scanners are probably another good addition but I found myself leaving them behind in favor of the Specialists skill. The gate mission in particular was substantially easier thanks to the scans.I think the best advice I heard concerning Archons was to avoid attacking them until you could afford to primary them  once hit they tended to go melee crazy but until then they tended to try to stay at range which was less effective. With that advice I waited until I could direct enough firepower at them to kill them and that seemed to work exceptionally well. Never had too much difficulty with them.I found Stun Lancers to be the worst particularly earlier in the game where your soldiers arent experienced and wellequipped enough to deal with them. Had no shame when I used one of the workshop mods to nerf them think it was the one that drops their HP a bit and removes their ability to meleecrit on a flank. Well see how I feel in my current CommanderIronman playthrough  trying the mod that nerfs the Stun Lancers mobility rather than their HP and melee skills also nerfs the Vipers range to nonridiculous levels. Have a few other mods in there too of course... the double enemy spawn one for more ADVENT soldiers etc..The only other thing I remember feeling trepidation when I encountered them were Sectoids when they werent dumb enough to help me by spawning zombies zombies? ZOMBIES! they were spamming mind control or panic on my soldiers.

6696014,0,t1_d0bwe5a,Thats the issue I have with double penalties not only mission based ones. Failing a hack is a penalty in itself since youve wasted one of your most precious resources  an action. Enemies getting a permanent buff on top of this is disproportionate and can easily tip the risk vs reward balance towards a not worth it.Thematically the only case you should lose a region is if you fail a retaliation. Thats in line with failing a terror in XCOM  and is easily justifiable. You COULD get an income penalty for skipping some missions if a region loses trust in your abilities to lead the resistance but losing a region? No way.,Xcom,d0bxc75,1,t5_2si6x

6700982,0,t3_47ejep,If you can do Ironman Commander with  soldiers lost youll have a lot of fun on Legend. It is a substantial step up but a fun one. Others have listed the main practical differences longer build times longer wound times harder enemies more enemies no aim cheats. The main one for me is that it is much harder to recover from mistakes on Legend especially in the early game. Errors tend to spiral out of control and its easy to fall behind. Once youve got to the mid game it isnt too much harder than Commander. But getting a campaign off to a good start is tricky. So be ready for a tough first few months and dont be surprised if it kicks your ass the first few campaigns that you try. It gets better and you get better. ,Xcom,d0cfu3p,3,t5_2si6x

6703420,0,t3_47emin,I could see this coming in to play a lot sooner than countdown clock. In a LW style mod instead of just having advanced troopers show up at some point have a choice of dark events advent armor for a month Chrisalids for a month or  hp for all Advent troopers permanently. having to balance the difference between something awful for one month Vs something kinda bad permanently is an interesting one I think. Some other ideas  minmax damage to enemy units enemies can move farther when popped enemy sight radius increase a small increase to Intel costs a small decrease to exp gained so on and so fourth. You have an increasing chance of seeing one of these pop up every month but can not get more than one permanent event per month atleast until super late game. Again I like the idea of having to pick between something super awful for one month Vs something kinda annoying forever. But I think with that system three dark events us a little much maybe just two. ,Xcom,d0cowoe,1,t5_2si6x

I dont find myself using the hook more than once a mission most of the time.So because the grapple only saves you  halfturn of movement its only going to really save you  or  halfturns per mission.The rocket launcher also saves you a halfturn per mission because you can blue move then use it.  But it ALSO does damage AND shreds armor AND deals aoe damage AND works from a long way back.Also snipers are the class that can most easily lose the utility slot as theyre often far back enough that giving them a mimicscanballordinary nade is awkward to use with them.  No the only utility slot they really really use is their ammo.Oh and when youre dry when you need to NOT be dry you can reload and rocket in the same turn.

6726475,0,t3_47pyue,I love my gunslinger.  Easily MVP of my CI run.  Its all about ammo types and attacking multiple times per turn.  They are a burst damage class that excels at either killing one high health enemy or many wounded enemies in one turn.First you should never attack a unit with armor with a gunslinger.  Since you are doing many low damage attacks armor significantly reduces their effectiveness.  Always shred first.  Second always bring ammo.  I like bluescreen and fire rounds personally depending on the mission as they both significantly increase the damage per shot done by a raw amount.The other key thing to note is that people seem to think that the gunslinger should be very mobile I disagree.  You rarely want to move and shoot if you can avoid it.  I always give my gunslingers grapple so they can reposition for free.Here are two scenarios where the gunslinger excels.  First lets consider a high hp target like say a second stage andromedon.  Your gunslinger can lightning hands fan fire AND pistol shot that target on one turn dealing insane amounts of damage especially if you have bluescreen rounds.Alternatively lets say you have done damage to many advent soldiers who now all have low health.  You can lightning hands a high HP trooper pistol shot another and end your turn with faceoff shooting both of those targets again as well as everyone else.  This will hopefully finish off the entire group.  Even if some survived they are now hopefully burning and will take even more damage at the start of their turn and have abilities disabled due to the fire.No other class can cleanup a situation like a gunslinger can except maybe a salvo grenadier.,Xcom,d0f2r3k,3,t5_2si6x

6783536,0,t3_48nl65,You are going to get crit through full cover. More often than youd think could possibly be reasonable. Being defensive isnt enough... you have to aim to murder every single enemy you find before they get a chance to shoot you... or at least emasculate them so badly theyre almost harmless. Cover destruction is an important part enemies who had the bench or lamppost they were hiding behind suddenly disappear die a lot nore easily. Blow things up a lot. Dont waste grenades but if you havent used them all by the end of the mission youre doing it wrong. They can solve almost every problem. Eliminate chance as much as possible. Get your  flanks use explosives stocks combat protocol whatever you can so that you dont have to rely on landing  an  shot. Thats not to say you wont ever be taking those shots you just want back up plans when they miss. Getting enemies to patrol into you and not moving up into fog of war without the entire team ready to act if theres contact is essential. You want to encounter enemies with as many moves as possible ideally they walk into your line of sight and take overwatch fire on their turn then give you a full turn to clean up. Obviously this doesnt apply during concealment. Mimic beacons are also crazy good.

6898231,0,t3_4a7uqd,I actually think endgame terror missions are some of the most fun specifically for that reason. Faceless ping off your armor you can take a beating from chrysalid claws and even against guns you dont really risk anyone getting hit out of cover. You typically have enough backups in the pool that whoever gets wounded can be subbed out for a week to a week and a half depending on the severity the existence of AWC means your unit can reliably Get back in the game after being hurt. Hell even if someone dies which is the worst case scenario but even if it happens you can shell out  to replace them through Resistance HQ.

Ive reached the endgame of my first playthrough now and am just waiting for a couple of last proving ground projects to pop before heading in and testing different builds out. My GS just went up to colonel so I guess Ill be giving fanfire a test run with bluescreen  although he also popped shredder on his sniper rifle so I might have to respec him to an SS anyhow. The skill description says main weapon unfortunately  otherwise he would be beyond awesome against sectos and gatekeepersTBH Ive never had a problem with sectopods and their trash mobs. Gatekeepers Im not so good at. I hit a gatekeeper  archon pod on my last council mission and exited it squad intact only by the blessing of outrageous fortune and beginners naivety.Again thanks.

7019143,0,t3_4bsd11,Proxy mines are currently bugged and Firaxis didnt fix this on the last patch.  The bug is the proxy mine will only hit the pod leader when it is triggered when your squad is still in concealment ie the pod patrols during concealment therefore detonating the mine.  If your squad is out of concealment it will hit the entire pod.  Proxy mines are still useful.  I find that I can still drop them on an inactive pod by scouting with a concealed ranger and then moving a grenadier just out of LOS to drop the mine with their extended range and radius.  Or dropping mines on reinforcements is always  fun.My preferred method of activating a pod with proxy mines during concealment is to drop it with a Salvo grenadier and then activating the pod with a shot.  Youll break concealment with the shot and then BOOM!Hopefully Firaxis fixes this bug on the next patch. ,Xcom,d1bywxw,7,t5_2si6x

7074645,0,t3_4cgars,This is actually a common mistake in how we interpret random chance. There is no lucky streak. There are random deviations but in the long run every series of events goes through Regression to the Mean which means that somebody who seams to have a lucky streak will soon get back to normal performance which we wrongly interpret as getting worse after a lucky streak as well as the other way round. So it would make more sense to keep the unlucky soldier since he will perform better in the future as he did now. But the truth is It doesnt matter. Since random events like coin tosses are independent from each other past performance does not indicate anything on future performance.

7115641,0,t3_4cwrb1,Due to my own playstyle of Efficiency over Explosives I really cant see that crazy of a use for Troopers they feel like some sort of GrenadierRanger hybrid with some Psi ops Gunslinger and alot of free stats in between. His ability tree seems to be insanely passive focused it doesnt exactly fit the sort of Move flank fire repeat sort of style nor is it fitting to a sort of front line class as it is throwing a huge amount of stats in your face for what essentially. Lets look at these abilities. Momentum is but since you are almost always moving this just turns into free dodge chance. Flame Burst is linear damage in a line similar to that of Null lance while I would say my argument for Null lance to just simply use it on one target it doesnt do as good damage as say a normal shot granted it can apply Disorientate but its only sometimes. Penetrating burst has the same issue with it being linear compared to Null lance and the issue is why would you want to use this ability use up more ammo and do the same damage most of the time on the other hand Preparedness is a huge load of stats. Next up is Adrenaline vs Room clearer Adrenaline is a big steroid of stats plus a small heal which can be infinite welcome to my sort of play style but again it isnt thematic to the sort of moving hit and runner the other skill Room Clearer is definitely something I would want to use it being able to panic enemies in a cone of fire and apply damage to a larger area this will see a lot more usage in my opinion. Take them down is like Mark from Leadership mod or Advent officers but I dont see that great of an addition true that this in combination with some Rangers will lead to the deadliest of crits but a small increase of  crit chance isnt something yayful. Spray and Prey is in my opinion a much better version of Penetrating burst as the comparison to it is the same as the comparison to Flame burst and Room clearer. Walk it off sounds like a semi decent ability it has the thematic similar to Sustain but without the Stasis immunity its mostly just a one time addition to health it can save lives but the Trooper can still be easily finished off by another attack. Tackle is pretty insane the ability to dash for one action plus stun a target is pretty insane you can put yourself in flanking positions run away from a group of enemies or just simply nullify a threat for a turn plus you can still reposition throw something or fire its really good. Focused Aim is another amount of stats it grants bonus damage that equal to the Ranger GTS training on crits and some aim while Napalm canisters adds damage to fire a good perk actually. Finally Bullet time and Set the world on fire Shall be referred to as STWOF. Bullet time is a bigger face off essentially with you needing to reload next turn as well while STWOF is a much more bigger Room Clearer which is something I enjoy. Honestly the last four ranks of abilities are the only abilities I can thematically understand and find ways to use them other than the bunch of abilities I mentioned earlier.If I had to use them I would probably go Preparedness Room clearer Spray and pray and Tackle for the last two I would either pick Napalm Canisters and STWOF or Focused Aim and Bullet time most likely Focused Aim and Bullet time since they compliment each other. I would probably use the WAR suit and add Shred storm and a Bluescreens on top for PCS I would probably try and get Movement for since this build wants him to be moving and getting good positions to mass AOE enemies down. For Weapon mods I would probably go Stock or Scope with Autoloader and Laser sight or Expanded Mag. He would probably replace a Grenadier since he would fill the same role albeit with less wall destruction.Note that I cant play X currently but these are my opinions from looking at these abilities.,Xcom,d1myiib,2,t5_2si6x

7123730,0,t1_d1nsmdr,gt For Rangers you want Movement PCS Phantom and Run and Gun     Ill argue for Conceal instead of Run and Gun. If your Ranger is a Phantom theyre not gonna participate until the last pod of the map anyway and the chance that youre gonna need a clutch RnG at that point are tiny especially as you can get really close while concealed.     Conceal lets your Ranger participate in one extra encounter per mission and is always useful every single mission of the campaign. Especially coupled with Shadowstrike you have one extra basically guaranteed shotgun crit which is usually one dead alien for anything smaller than an Andromedon.I know a lot of people go OH MY GOD RUN AND GUN and instinctively pick that I did too but seriously Conceal is much more consistent in its usefulness. I can count with one hand the number of times I used Run and Gun on my first three campaigns but I use Conceal all the time big exception being the last mission always respec your Ranger into RnG specifically for the final room,Xcom,d1nvvvs,1,t5_2si6x

7184980,0,t3_4dwdh3,The infantry is a solid class. Its certainly strong but I think its pretty close to balance with the stronger vanilla classes largely due to being restricted to rifles. Im not totally convinced of that however and certainly cant argue against it being called overpowered hes removed shotguns and nerfed fire for effect since the first time I played and I havent had a chance to play through with one since then. CI marathon with about  mods. perks flaregtcrippling shotgtstick and movegtdeep reservesgtfire for effectgear Rifles ammo flashbangs or a heavy weapon. Scope or laser sight and exp mags or autoloader. Perc PCS. Opportunist is decent but harrier is amazing. I still think it needs to be toned down a bit as its a stong bonus that also works on noncover seeking enemies. shake it off doesnt really do much for me and flare is a free action. Sold.zone of control seems a decent passive but crippling shot can often get you the guaranteed damage you need to finish off your prey. established defenses doesnt do anything for me and stick and move is really good. Both bonuses are good and you always have one active.Deep reserves is a decent contingency plan. Stacked with the AWC they can be gravely wounded and still probably not miss the next engagement. Escape and evade is interesting but its very rare when the infantrys solution is to run away instead of killing  things. Fire for effect is amazing. It was broken good when you could use it to activate a pod hitting and probably critting all the enemies and still having a turn. Still a solid opener but not quite as broken. Explosive action could be very strong but I really like AoE. I really like the class. I think that the harrier bonus probably needs to be cut in half as well as the stick and move bonuses to really make the class balanced. ,Xcom,d1uvbdy,2,t5_2si6x

7226106,0,t3_4eegcx,They havent said anything about it.  I personally think all it needs is for its accuracy modifier to match the current shotgun for it to benefit from Hunters Instinct and for the accuracy of the shotgun to either drop of faster andor have a higher aim penalty once beyond the optimal range.  Why consider a riflesword setup when the shotgun does more damage and has enough range to reasonably engage most targets?Part of the issue is that the shotgun is just so powerful.  How do you rebalance the sword to compete with something that can potentially do  damage in a single round and not have it be OP?  On the Firaxis forums when the sword topic would come up several people would admit that the sword mods often made the sword OP...but they didnt care because it was fun.  Which is fine for a mod but highlights the issue of trying to buff the sword instead of potentially nerfing the likely OP shotgun.,Xcom,d1zjyre,7,t5_2si6x

Fair enough something youd expect to see an experienced player doing as its important information. Problem is he was vastly overestimating their movement range. Sectoids can bluemove  tiles in EW. He seemed to think they could move about  tiles. Almost as if hed seen it written in a file somewhere.

Put a medkit on the spotter so hes immune to poison and keep him hunkered in full cover to give some safety from being shot preferably indestructible cover as missed LPR shots from the thin men will tear down cover. Hopefully you can whittle down the thin men safely from squadsight distance before they get to your spotter. If not hunker then full cover plus babysmoke will give you  defense which should be enough for safety against thin men most of the time. hp thin men are the curse of II.

7524648,0,t3_4ieu3c,heres something fun about xcom EW enemies will ALWAYS move after being flanked and will NEVER move into a space where they are flanked even if they have to dash. So you can make the aliens throw their move by positioning your soldiers correctly. just make sure they have a space to dash to where they arent flanked or theyll shoot instead. Anyways  I consider xcom EW to be much more tense than xcom  because you cant alpha strike and take out a whole pod before they fireback you actually have to plan for their counter attacks.  Also hunker down is more useful in EW since it doubles cover bonus making heavy cover give you  defence which is unhittable by anything but late game or elevated foes and it lowers your sight radius which is remarkably  useful for rookies because if they the individual soldier cant see bad things happen they cant panic from it.

Bulldog generally was considered the voice of the squad which ended up coming up in use a few times.For example at one point the younger and much less experienced American Heavy Strobe and Bulldog cleared out a medium sized UFO by themselves after the rest of low ranking squad had either been mind controlled or killed. In regards to Nix he had previously been part of JTF and was one of the hardest soldiers to get Canada to agree to send but also luckily was one of the first sent in. He was generally set up further away from the rest of the squad which sometimes made the rest of the squad worried especially when there was a possibility of him being picked off. For the longest time he was the main killer of the more elite foes but the rest of the team eventually started to rival him.Strobe was a newly enlisted US Marine who often times found himself outmatched due to his gung ho attitude although with time he was able to take point and take down stronger foes that the Support soldiers would have died from.There were two French soldiers Scarecrow and Doc male and female respectively both were highly skilled combat medics before being drafted into the XCOM project and both ended up saving the life of the other squad members multiple times.Finally there was a Mexican Assault soldier Loco who basically fulfilled Bulldogs role in the case Bulldog was hurt or the squad split up. So basically that was who they were. Between missions they joked with each other and just hung out.In the end Bulldog became the Volunteer and the squad was easily flying through their last mission. Sadly in the end the Uber Ethereal managed to mind control Scarecrow who then turned around and killed a wounded Strobe. The squad was forced to watch one of their friends kill another before their eyes but luckily were able to collect themselves. Once Scarecrow managed to shake off the Ubers grip he was gunned down by the aliens tragically becoming the second death in the squad since it started. Luckily the last death was Bulldog who ran up to the Uber and ended both it and humanitys war.,Xcom,d303rs6,1,t5_2si6x

Why go through an interview process when this should literally be the best humanity has to offer? If the aliens didnt care too much they pick the lazy option and kidnap the biggest cheese they can find and assume its humanitys best. If not cool theyre being lazy.If they did care and research humanity with thin mints theyd find out anyway the commander is the best.

7725777,0,t3_4l5536,Normal tends to teach bad tactics because the game cheats in your favor.  On normal difficulty the AI will deliberately make bad moves and your shot chances are inflated  of displayed chance plus a hidden bonus for each consecutive miss.  All of those bonuses go away plus the aliens get more HP which makes sitting and trading fire a bad idea.Generally speaking my tactics focus on keeping my troops alivehealthy.  Advance slowly to limit extra pod activations.  Breaking LOS and setting overwatch traps is completely reasonable in many circumstances.  Ignore warnings about killing aliens with explosives keeping your troops safe is far more important than weapon fragments.On the strategic level plan ahead.

7781833,0,t1_d3pj33u,To be fair you couldnt really make a bad choice on this front.  Using the weaker missiles vs scouts actually meant you were less likely to blow them up.  So even though your damage was lower and not even by much there was a positive to the tradeoff too.  Also consistency the lower damage missile fired faster so unlucky miss streaks were less likely.There was no wrong missile against raiders exactly the right armor to make both missile types about the same damage and everything else said medium or high armor and thus more armor pen  better.  There wasnt much of a this or that choice beyond the starter weapons.  You either go for coilguns or pulse lasers and whichever one you go for you use.

7905126,0,t3_4njqon,Failing assaults against landed ships does absolutely nothing edit of benefit for you at the strategic level afaik.  You get XP and any loot from whatever you killed and thats about it iirc.  edit As far as effecting the strategic level failing the mission  regardless of the manner in which you do it  is equivalent to ignoring the mission.Aliens lose resources if you shoot down successfully assault or destroy UFOs and also if you damage them with interceptors proportional to the damage inflicted thats it.  Your performance on the ground outside the binary you killed all aliens success or you extracted failure affects nothing aside from your own rewards for the mission. You could kill fifty Sectopods or two Sectoids you could demolish the ship with  archers spamming proxy mines or extract immediately after arrival doesnt affect the aliens one iota.  Only thing that matters is if you win or lose... and even that only matters if its a landing rather than a crash.Long War does not make the game anywhere close to as realistic as you might think.  After all they have to work within the confines established by the base game  which made almost no attempt whatsoever to create any kind of simulation abstracted or otherwise.  Long Wars implementation basically adds a few backenvelope variables to vary things by but its still very abstracted.

X has timers on the majority of missions to prevent that.EW psionics is a buff to existing soldiers. X psionics is its own class which you have to promote a rookie to.Explosives in X are  accurate but lower damage. Launchers in X can be equipped by anyone wearing the proper armor.In general there are moreuseful item types in X t basic arrmor has two item slots and specialty suits have one item slot as a tradeoff for launcher mounting or grapplephase.In X armor is a simpler system which is used on a lot more enemies. You can remove it with any grenade.In X the classes are different. You will need to adapt to new strategies to utilize thing like melee drone based hacking and support and the limitationsfreedoms of grenade rather than rocket launchers.In X you can fire rockets after moving. And flamethrowers and shred cannons and other stuff that goes in that slot.In X there is no stealth or permanent flight armor.  The equivalent of ghost armor in stead gives you an ability to walk through walls. There is no real equivalent of archangel armor nor do you or any enemies have the ability to just fly in the air and fire weapons.In X there are no SHIVs.in X you still get a scaling range penalty when using squad sight. You will need much more aim gear to attack at exreme ranges and you will find yourself moving your snipers much more often.In X many missions start concealed and stealth is very different. Generally less avaliable and is LOSsound based though the ranger class has perks that let them utilize stealth more efficiently.In X your base is a spaceship you fly around you dont launch satellites and there are no interceptors. In stead the aliens try to intercept you and you invade them.In X the maps are randomly generated from smaller tiles. You cant learn the maps like you can in EW.In X Bradford no longer wears that damn sweater and has resolved his concerns about close range.There is no kidnapping or interrogation of aliens in X.

8137853,0,t1_d4uqn1i,gt Look Im not trying to claim Im some sort of professional or turboelite gamer. I have a few campaigns under my belt but thats about it. Im just saying that in my personal experience its incredibly useful and I never took Double Tap after seeing what ITZ can do while  kills didnt happen all that often I can still remember several instances of it and  kills was pretty regular. It was amazing for cleaning up crap like Drones exposed Mutons wounded Mechtoids or Berserkers and Chryssalids then popping a Sectopod or something in cover on the last shot and letting all my other guys ignore the trash the Sniper had just gotten rid of.Unfortunately for my social life I am a turboelite gamer at least when it comes to Long War. Heres the thing. Standard pod size in Vanilla is  one leader unit and two grunts. Best use case for ITZ in vanilla is killing all three in one turn. Great. Buts not so easy to achieve with only six soldiers and you cant afford to burn excess explosives on every single pod.Meanwhile Double Tap is far more versatile. You can shoot twice and you dont have to worry about the chain breaking. So you can almost match ITZ for effectiveness if you get two killshots. However what makes DT good is that is also can doubledown on single target damage. In Long War you have other better tools for this but you really dont in Vanilla. In conclusion DT is better because it can almost do what ITZ can do in the best case almost every time and also has more versatility. gt First time Ive heard of it. I could swear Id successfully used ITZ on flanked enemies but I may be remembering badly. I generally didnt try flanking with the sniper Id just fling a rocket and take out their cover.By the way Im just curious  what makes Double Tap so great? I genuinely dont get it. The only real advantage it seems to hold is the fact that its guaranteed extra shots but its only one and with lategame Sniper accuracy ITZ all but guaranteed more shots than that. I guess using Headshot for both would be nice but surely it cant make that big a difference?Sadly a real Vanilla bug that almost ended a few of my campaigns. It got fixed in Long War Beta  March  . I think JL and Amineri thought about some sniper buffs after this point but I dont think anything ever came out of that technically infeasible but one of the ideas to make all of the Sniper capstones balanced as it was generally accepted that ITZ was the best overall DT was good for single target dps and Mayhem just bad was to make DT allow the user to use special shots precision shot disabling shot twice in one turn as well. ,Xcom,d4urzdw,1,t5_2si6x

8178279,0,t3_4rc15h,Theres probably a ton of tips on legend but Id just say in general that the early game is a lot more unforgiving. If you can make it through to JuneJuly you are going to find the middle  end of the game easier than the start. If you feel overwhelmed keep that in mind. If youre playing ironman turn that off and play through to mid game at least a few times.Things that helped me Cover feels very different in Legend. Hunkering down is a good option versus a mediocre shot. Particularly on early missions where a advent commander might be targeting you. In commander subsequent shots benefit from an aim bonus after a miss. In Legend all shots have the stated chance to hit so spamming shots does not help like it does in easier difficulties. Experimental grenades are fantastic. You are going to need to take enemies out of action more often i.e. no single turn pod kill. Using the right grenades makes this easier. Debuffing enemies by setting them on fire helps if they have nasty abilities. Gold moves into unexplored territory are suicide. In commander an unlucky activation was a nuisance in legend it might be a squad wipe. Just keep playing. Accept that gatecrasher may have wounded soldiers. I.e. dont play for perfect missions all the time. Like everything time spent in the game is rewarded with getting better. If something goes wrong ask yourself what you learnt  would do differently next time. And watch a video or two by Faleg or Christopher odd  stop when enemies are engaged and ask yourself what would I do?  then watch what they did. Youll learn a few new tactics.o  Hang in there commander.  I found legend to be a big jump but it does get easier if you persevere. ,Xcom,d4zu1nj,1,t5_2si6x

My personal theory is that this is the same Ethereal prodding the Commander on in the final mission. But he speaks of defeating them again.Doesnt make sense if the Ethereal is prodding on the one that has been talking to us the whole time so clearly it was directed at the Commander. Which suggests to me that Ethereal is the Uber from XCom EU.

8319481,0,t1_d5gtw1j,I was initially worried this would be a but it still sucks kind of argument but Im glad it wasnt. Onto the argumentgt I believe for the strategy genre specifically taking out the thinking and the need to stop and analyze everything and weigh all of your options because the wrong move can make or break a situation is equivalent to removing depth.I mostly agree but I have one question how do difficulty levels fit into this? If a theoretical game has X set of mechanics and nuances but you only need to really sit down and analyze them on higher difficulty levels and on lower ones you are allowed to get by with plenty of mistakes and suboptimal strategies......does the game still has depth? Would depth be considered on a difficultybydifficulty basis as in lower difficulty has no depth but harder does? We could totally disagree on this but I personally think a game has depth as a whole or it doesnt regardless of how each difficulty is balanced. You are expected to have higher mastery and knowledge of the mechanics on harder difficulties than on lower ones but the underlying complexity still exists. Going back to XCOMs question of depth... you know what? I think you are right. I did say I agreed with thisgtThus a poor player will consider only the most obvious elements while masters will consider many. And I agree with what you say heregtMaster players will see minimal layers because their plans ignore large parts of the games choices and sees them as unimportant. This is contrary to our established definition of depth.So yes it does not fit the proper definition of proper depth that I would like it to fit.Now if I had to push to find common ground on one of my early points about balance I think I would start from this but with a caveatgtIf balance is off ... then that instantly cuts a lot of depthor basicallygt balance issues remove depthThe caveat is that I dont think it removes it. Bad balance definitely hurts depth and can make it useless unappealing or even trivialize it but its still there. LW did add a good amount of mechanics and content into vanilla EUEW but also rebalanced the current ones into better depending and feeding into each others. The potential depth on the old parts was there and LW did a great even if flawed in some aspects job making it real.On XCOM  if you self restrict into not using the most overpowered and on the long term unfun strategies and tactics the game currently has your plans actually have to consider a lot more layers risking one soldier over another managing wound times and roster changes leaving one type of enemy threat alive over another when to cut losses and evac. Having to self restrict is a horrible compromise that shouldnt occur if the game was properly balanced but it gives some insight on the depth that I think it would have if it was. And just to be clear I dont recommend AT ALL having to selfrestrict as a replacement for good balanceSo having reconsidered a lot at most Id now argue that XCOM has potential depth but not actual realized PROPER depth. Though Id blame balance moreso than the mechanics themselves. Feel free to argue this conclusion of courseThough whats the point of having depth on an unbalanced game? I think the point would be that a potentially deep but unbalanced game can be patched into having depth again but a shallow one would already be a lost cause. I hold my hopes for XCOM.,Xcom,d5hhp0e,2,t5_2si6x

8402825,0,t1_d5rw60d,yeah veteran and commander would have aim assist.so i think the issue is as follows.Aim assist data isnt stored in each ability context.So perfect information needs to estimate the aim assist based on the latest history frameHowever each close combat specialist shot is its own frame so PI probably only grabs the aim assist at the final frame.And if you missed a lot your aim assist probably stacked enough to push your aim to the maximum aim possible via aim assist anyways my point is you shouldnt experience this issue on legend or if you disable perfect informations aim assist estimator.Theres not too much I can do to fix this WITHOUT a highlander since Id need to edit ability contexts to store aim assist data the moment it was calculated.

8617812,0,t3_4xvh2z,Well... if timeraltering mods and chronomancy are completely out of the questionBattle scanners can be really useful as they allow you to rush as much as possible while reducing the chance that youll run into enemies with your pants down.Some of the items added by the AH dlc can be really useful as they allow you to stun enemies which gives you some breathing room when you cant kill a whole pod on turn . Equipping your whole team with spider suits allows you to rush objectives while being less likely to be detected if you can get far enough for that to be viable. Having  grenadiers and  sharpshooters allowed me to end engagements rather quickly as the grenadiers would expose and shred enemies while the sharpshooters would finish them off. However using this strategy means that youll have to neglect rangers and hackers both of which become very powerful when fully ranked. Also if you run out of grenades and you still have two squads to go through it may be hard as grenadiers have some really crappy aim without any PCSsscopes so youll have to rush them forward into no mans land to get some use out of their cannons while your sharpshooters desperately try to pick off whats left. Of course once you get to the point where you have plasma grenades gauss weapons and decentlyleveled troops this tactic becomes a lot more effective as grenades will do more damage and sharpshooters will be able to shoot things more often and more accurately with more damage to boot.,Xcom,d6itqem,2,t5_2si6x

8670254,0,t3_4ynt1g,This is caused by not created equally not hidden potential. NCE uses a stat trading system in which each soldier has multiple random trades of stats starting with the default stats. So they might trade  aim for  health then trade  defense for  aim then trade  health for  mobility etc. The end result of this is that soldiers who are really weak in one area tend to be really strong in other areas. Rarely do you have soldiers who are just straight up worse then others. What do I think about the mod? I love it and will never play without it. It reminds me of XCom from the old days and adds a lot more strategy to well everything in my opinion. I find myself using alternate class builds or unorthodox squad comps because of NCE. And I have favorite soldiers who roll just the right stats. If you dont like the possibility of going down to  HP you can configure LW toolbox in the .ini file that changes the maximum deviations from starting stats. Everything is very customizable just like LW was  toolbox just provides the backbone for making the systems work. EDIT Also in case you hadnt figured this out already liberal use of the GTS or Commanders Choice is vital when playing with NCE. I use the GTS because Commanders Choice mods can be kinda buggy but one or the other is absolutely necessary. You cant afford to have soldiers beyond Gatecrasher and the first few missions get their classes randomly assigned when they have random stats. ,Xcom,d6pehu5,4,t5_2si6x

8691314,0,t3_4z19dg,Low ranked rocketeers will feel very weak. Ive found that only once they get Fire in the Hole which makes for a fairly accurate rocket or Snap Shot for faster paced missions do rocketeers start gaining their true power. Steadying aim is important at all ranks but is a MUST if you dont want to rely on incredible luck for newer rocketeers. Giving them aiming things such as Scopes or Laser Sights will also help a tiny bit. Some people give them Carbines for the same reason though I opt for the SMG for the mobility so they can reliably move between cover and steady.On the other side rockets are absolutely invaluable especially as you move later into the game. Shredder rockets are vital in softening up tough enemies. HEAT Warheads allows a rocket to obliterate pods of Drones and Seekers and puts a notable dent into Cyberdiscs.They are a bit of an investment They are a slower weak shooter early on but become very powerful when they have their perks and tools. Javelin Rockets can mess up a pod beyond your LoS Tandem Warheads allow for a max damage shot on a pod for incredible AoE damage multiple rockets from perks allows for multiple uses of this powerful tool and so on.,Xcom,d6s1jum,16,t5_2si6x

10071415,0,t3_5jydw2,I never got why the game always seemed to give Difficult and Very Difficult but then maybe only two Easy missions in the entire game. Theyre actually indicators for how many Ayyys will be on the map. IIRC  for Diff  for Vdiff. Unless thats XCOM .One thing that made this fun for me was realizing that I could lose. Badly. I could lose my best soldier because that bullshit roll how the hell did the sectoid crit from half the map away I was in full cover of poor positioning or a randomly activated pod that ended up flanking me. I could lose my planes. I could lose my countries even.But that makes it fun once you realize you dont always in everything perfectly. Treat it like a roguelike you or your soldiers will possibly bite the bullet.Couple Strategic Ant Farm level tips I found helpful when I started. Edit after making this long list I... didnt expect to say this much.... Experimental Warfare gt Foundry. Helps lots. nd thing after or concurrent satellites I want to say.. Build a satellite once you get to the base. You can launch it during your first month.. Engineers are slightly more important than scientists early game so you can start developing your base.. Certain buildings gain Adjacent bonuses. I cant remember if a x box in the ant farm gives  bonuses or if its just  bonuses because  are touching.... If you have Enemy Within just play that. It introduces certain rebalances new enemies new technology paths. Nothing changes really except for those.. Dont go nuts with excavating everything all at once. Just what you need when you start planning out your base.. Steam vents are awesome ONLY if theyre closer to surface. Otherwise you should be able to hold over for a bit by using regular generator adjacency bonuses.. Get the Officer Training School ASAP. Buy Squad Size ASAP. Wet Work is also desirable but only if you have the cash to spend. Moh levelz moh aim moh ded ayyys moh bonuses.. Think carefully about starting continent and where to shoot your first satellites. Some bonuses are nicer than others earlygame others lategame. South Americas Instant Autopsy perk is especially nice because it can cut heh  days off to be used on more important things. Or North Americas ability to make and maintain aircraft for less.. Abductions are as much about rewards as Panic management. You cant always mitigate the panic in other countries and you do end up with a lost country. Even people on higher difficulties still lose countries. Unless theyre on Long War they do scary things.. Terror missions they... are a bag of tricks. They can be your best friend by being a Panic Reset button. Or they can be your Ex GF showing up with her new beefy Berserker boyfriend with his homeboy Sectopod golden shower on your otherwise happy parade.Tactical. Full cover. If you have to not be in full cover you need to be confident that you can make a good shot or a Flank to intimidate an Ayyy into retreating.. Start of a turn dont use all of your actions on a single squaddie at once. Move up your guy thats furthest from where you want to go with one Blue move. That way with moving from cover to cover you still have  move on that guy to shoot or run away while other squaddies can move in with their full  actions and set up shop.. Grenades are your friend early game. Having more powerful units that can kill things quickly is better than sacrificing a unit here and there to get one fragment. Just try and keep count of how many fragments you have and where youre tossing the grenades.. The numbers. They lie. You can miss all of your  shots but your  shot can hit and crit more than them.. Weapons gt Armor for item research. They are also hefty investments make sure you have extra resources to build them once finished researching. Sadly unlike XCOM  you need to build individual items instead of being able to upgrade everything all at once. Reasoning youre going to die before you kill the things you encounter after you finish researching the armor counterpart of the tier.

10221330,0,t1_dc2m22a,Absolutely not wrong at every turn mate youre just talking about entirely different things from me. You asked if Long War had any questionable design decisions and it absolutely does youre just pointing out that there are in fact positive aspects to the ones Ive highlighted.Is the air war better than it was in vanilla? Yes and no. Yes in the sense that they attempted to give it greater depth. But also no in the sense that its absolutely integral to your success and is very VERY VERY difficult despite still not being properly interactive.Terror missions. Yeah sure theyre good for increasing panic but the point I brought up is that they are awful to play. There is no reward only punishment. The Long War crew was often  justifiably  accused of making antifun design decisions and this is one of them. Which makes it pretty questionable in my mind. Important to bear in my mind that me saying its questionable doesnt necessarily mean it was the wrong decision for the Long War team to make which I feel like might be the way youre taking it?Startingcountrycontinent bonuses are a bit questionable if were being honest. North America being fairly uncontested in its strength as a continent is odd dont you think? Dont you question why Europe and Asias bonuses arent as brilliant considering theyre relevant for the entire campaign?I just flat out disagree with you on the defense stat variation though. Not strictly necessary for biotanking at all in my opinion.

I opened Steam and verified Integrity of Game Files in case you dont know how its Library gt Right click on XCOM  gt Properties gt Local Files tab gt Verify Integrity of Game Files it redownloaded the Config folder. I launched XCOM  without any mods active not even LW reached main menu and closed the game. I activated just LW on the launcher launched XCOM  again reached main menu and closed the game. Downloaded the Alternative Mod Launcher and put it a folder separate from my XCOM  install Ran the Alt Mod Launcher to check for conflicts of my regularly used mods and LW. In my case LifetimeStats showed a conflict imgur link The Alt Mod Launcher crashed when I tried to Run XCOM  from it so I went back to the regular Launcher but knowing not to use the mod that had a conflict The end everything worked from here.

10428635,0,t1_dcpvbom,gt Yes you say reinforcements are a solution but to me that is also a timer with a fail condition at around  turns because theres suddenly  units dropping in on you  to me it gives the same result as a timer just different means to an end.The difference is that theres potential counterplay there and an escalation in risk rather than the game slamming the door shut in your face. See Invisible Inc.s brilliant timerofescalatingdoom. Adding pure randomness to the mix doesnt seem like a fix to me though when the stars align and multiple randomized elements all roll low then you get a truly awful situation for the player which they had little control over. Bias the system in favor of the player and instead you get unreliable but free advantages which I think runs counter to what LW is striving for. Theres already plenty of very random elements that can make the same  turn mission a cakewalk or a massacre and randomizing the timer on top of that just throws balance out the door.I dont know that dropping more reinforcements alone is enough though. There could be things like Big Sky being forced to flee to a new extraction point or maybe incurring severe repair costs for overstaying. Really I would just be happy with any solution that doesnt make me  lose a soldier who had to path around something I didnt account for and came up  tile short of extraction despite there not being a single enemy left.,Xcom,dcq5kpj,2,t5_2si6x

That is to say they heard sounds of battle and are pseudoactivated by that.  They start running towards the noise and can take shots on activation.You can prevent it for the most part by not using explosives.  Gunshots create noise for the same distance as sight range gunner is a couple squares further but grenades and rockets are further plus they are centered on the explosion I assume which means that the noise range goes WAY past vision range.If you already knew that and just hate the mechanic you can probably disable it by just setting the noise range of everything in the game to .They also alert if they patrol across corpses.,Xcom,dd3yv0o,7,t5_2si6x

10564692,0,t1_dd5kb4r,I think it boils down to extraction missions being part of the original council missions set.On other mission rescue from cellvan capture VIP you had to go to a set objective. In extractions the extraction point IS the objective.The additional missions mod has among others an extract from rioting city where you have to get the VIP from a cell and call big sky to gtfo. Although in the end you end up dropping the flare close to the objective anyway it feels much less forced and it also means that you can bail early if things go south.Overall its much better.Id be fine with keeping the evac point fixed on extraction missions for balance reasons but many other missions could really gain by getting rid of it.,Xcom,dd5mlfc,8,t5_2si6x

Its frankly a little embarrassing knowing that the Pavonis folks who are as much a part of this community as anyone have to wade through some of the shit Ive seen lately sadly its becoming a black mark against this otherwise great sub.Instead though youve been respectful to the incredible amount of effort and passion put into LW described a superb nonLW config named some of the best mods around and exactly why you prefer your setup... I was playing a very similar campaign to you only a month or so ago and I agree its an awesome time.

10651458,0,t1_ddeca9z,True Concealment Im going to have to just disagree with folks on. Especially because I tend to use lots of PCP and Map packs that accentuate the problems of having such short timers on huge maps. Particularly a problem in the fixed extraction on the Extract VIP missions. Your argument for RiskReward plays is valid on most mission types though!I dont feel like rushing headlong towards the objective only having the option to move recklessly forward really feels like XCOM at all. In EUEW that was stupid and suicidal. Id rather have reinforcement pressure higher enemy counts etc than being arbitrarily forced into bad plays. Thats tying the players hands giving them only one option and then punishing them for taking it. The opposite of tactical. The opposite of engaging decision making. At the same time though XCOM is first and foremost about making the best out of bad situations and risk management. In the spirit of that sentiment I generally dont give myself something without taking something else away. So while True Concealment may not be balanced by default there are other mods and config tweaks that I try and throw the aliens a bone with too. Things like lower timers in the LW config so I am punished severely if I do screw up the concealment phase and like Redfog set to XCOM only etc. The LW version of True Concealment also has some interesting options that Ive yet to experiment withSuch as having the True Concealment effect only work at certain infiltration levels andor having it percentageRNG based instead of guaranteed to retain turns. Truth be told Im still figuring out LW and the right balance I want for it. ,Xcom,ddem6kn,3,t5_2si6x

Not recruiting for months and hunting faceless that whole time it seems spectacularly unlikely that you could have that many.Using a higher ranked soldier will find faceless significantly faster though as will using an officer. Using a psi operative is the fastest by a pretty large margin though the training time to get them to high rank probably offsets that.,Xcom,ddnwa8e,4,t5_2si6x
10742001,0,t3_5tizz5,I have three types of officers and they usually break down based on missions more then class. Passive bonus officers  I use high base aim rangers and sharpshooters mostly gunners would work to. they take the passive bonuses like lead by example defilade air controller amp combined arms. These are typically on combat missions mostly dealing with harder missions like HQ assault ambush Supply raids miniretalitions or missions where there is no hard timer but has more enemies on the mission if i want to do it. During downtime they tend to be haven advisors where needed as the game progresses to deal with faceless since they are good at combat. I rarely use the clickables on these officers beyond intervention amp command. Its basically not possible for me to train them as pistol users due to how the AWC time works on legend so i do no bother but would like to.General Use   Support grenadiers and specialists fill this role. They tend to take the normal run of the mill missions and i use them on stealth missions where i need to have a nonofficer shinobi interact with an objective for whatever reason. I really like the support grenadier as an officer since they tend to launch a grenade then can use the clickables and other officer actions. They almost always take the right side tree and then combined arms since the passives they have do not really do much for aim. Spec ops officers  mostly shinobis who take the abilities to help stealth missions with one specialist who has stealth AWC perks who takes over when shinobis are not available or have a nonofficer shinobi on the team. Typically left side to Major then defilade amp air controller. ,Xcom,ddnyfkg,1,t5_2si6x

Sure after  hours in the game you can ignore all the stealth missions but those  hours you have to go through first are the problem. The game punishes you for engaging from endless waves of reinforcements to every enemy pod on the map running at you.   In the early game Stealth is just superior to tactical engagement play.

On another note I understand that LW is a game and designing it this way helps to explicitly balance the probability distribution etc but I cant help but wish that what was under the hood of Advent activities and the XCOM exploiting of those activities was much more simulationist and organically related to Advents own priorities and goals. ,Xcom,ddofhg9,10,t5_2si6x

10946170,0,t3_5wckir,These kind of things are super hard to create guides for because of how vast your options are in LW. There are so many variables that dictate what the optimal strategy for each playthrough is that aside from something like Research Lasers before your first Liberation and shit even that isnt necessarily great advice. Perfectly possible to do an HQ Assault with conventional shit the advice could be completely wrong based on how the game progressed for you.Base layout is a bit different but again your build priority can be majorly influenced by whats happening in your campaign. Power coil positions also make planning a base from the getgo a bit impractical.As for everything else its all judgment calls. No answer is going to hold true throughout every playthrough. Sometimes its better to liberate region A sometimes its better to liberate region B. Sometimes that Ateam in your barracks can handle all of the  Supply Raids and sometimes that sort of tactic will result in a squad wipe.It depends on how your campaign has progressed so far what youve made and what ADVENT has done. Its really hard to give advice on the strategic layer that applies in more than a few scenarios.This is one of those games where its better to ask Why and not What. Dont ask what to build ask why you should build it. Dont ask what missions to skip ask why they should be skipped. This gives information that you can apply to later game judgment and isnt strictly contextual.And this is why I suggest finding a good Lets Play. Find a youtuber that voices their reasoning for their decisions. Thats probably about the best guide youre going to find.,Xcom,de90qcs,6,t5_2si6x

10974618,0,t1_debxltt,On the other hand pods being dangerous when added makes scouting actually really damn important.

Why the hell is there self detonating charges on this box on a train car and why is it that its gonna go in  turns regardless if I flew in and infiltrated this place  days or  hours. Makes no narrative sense to me at all.Another point which I concede makes sense gameplaywise is how on earth we get to attack pods and other pods  meters away wont realize?

11314812,0,t3_61hgpg,yes they do. being able to know where the unactivated pods are is a huge boon. this means youll know if it is safe or not to run and gun your assaults or if its even safe to get closer to get better flanks or even just a little more distance to get better shots. also if you are hurting with gear they can easily pick up any loot that drops off dead enemy that die in the heart of the enemy. majority of the time the enemy is heading towards your team and thus leaving the loot behind them. so you can pick up the loot while the rest of the team is busy with killing them. you can also have shinobis as officers as well if you dont mind giving up any proximity bonuses and use things such as focus fire. so having a shinobi on every mission is always effective. if you are hurting for infiltration time I suggest thinking about having more people on intel or rethink your squads to make sure theyre not too large most missions can be done with  people if you are stealthing. if you are going loud you dont really need more than  units. dont forget you dont need to do every single mission you can skip a ton of them. for resources just make sure you are only buying nesscary items. for example a shinobi who is a scout and never attacks wont need any weapon upgrades. also not everyone needs armor if you are playing with a tank tactic where you make  unit in the team specifically to be the target of everyone only he needs good armor because hes the only one being attacked. keep those in mind and you will see a difference. ,Xcom,dfeil0k,4,t5_2si6x

11335188,0,t3_61s2jk,I just did a bit of calculations and found that it might be possible but very very unlikely. with advent strength  and you have no liberations this means that advent has no restrictions as to sending troops there thus you must not have done many missions there as you stated. and since you have no recruit jobs then you must have gotten all the rebels from jail breaks. these missions can provide  people be it rebels rookies or previously captured soldiers. and a region could start with  rebels   if its your home region but it seems like western US is your home region so technically if you had a starting region of  and got  jail breaks with  rebels each. but having all these factors line up is very very rare. not impossible as I thought but just really unlikely. ,Xcom,dfgtnzb,2,t5_2si6x

I only see the value of killing a muton elite with that skill as they are the only ones without much dodge chance. Bigger and more crucial targets like gatekeepers sectopods and even codexes have inherent dodge chances that makes the shot a dud. For smaller targets the crit itself should be able to finish their remaining HP take for example a   HP  armor shieldbearer if the shieldbearer takes any damage most likely the damage probably comes from a grenade that shaves off  armor and  hp. A crit shot from sharpshooter with center mass and gauss rifle should already finish that off and the likelihood of a crit shot is also maximized with the shieldbearer being flanked which means that its better off to take hunters instinct than kubikiri.,Xcom,dg2lwri,1,t5_2si6x

11782005,0,t3_683xbl, I highly recommend grabbing a couple mods. In particular Gotcha Again Evac All and Cost Based Ability Colors These do not modify gameplay at all only the user interface.If youre someone who likes information Id also recommend Perfect Information but be warned that you need to load it before Gotcha Again or you need to do the editing mentioned on the Gotcha Again page.You may also want to grab some of the speed up mods to reduce annoying delays and animations but thats more subjective. Be careful moving forward. Enemies are grouped in pods and if youre fighting one moving forward could cause you to activate another. Never trust a shot. Even if its  to hit dont assume that it will hit. Dealing with the randomness is huge in this game. Grenades are guaranteed but they are limited. Remember losing soldiers isnt game over. Its war shit happens. At the same time though dont be afraid to save scum if it makes the game more enjoyable for you.,Xcom,dgvj13u,3,t5_2si6x
11784963,0,t1_dgvq86b,For base X I like to keep at least one squad ready at all times.  This usually means focusing on at least  soldiers.,Xcom,dgvv4nd,2,t5_2si6x
11787495,0,t1_dgw2p0w,Thats brutal. Im amazed the sniper managed to complete the mission. Two sectopods at the same time the first time you see them nice. The first time I got  I was not ready. I had my soldiers dash away and hide saved the game and only went back the next day.,Xcom,dgw5h8u,2,t5_2si6x
