341576,0,t3_1xepil,Made something similar but with a  m bolt with screw threads over the full length. That way I can add hooks or clips at any point along the bolt. E.g. at the ends and in the middle made for some fun positions.,BdsmDIY,cfg69y5,1,t5_2src2
981428,0,t1_chflgzb,You dont mention your woodworking skills  I would expect hardwood could work as could lexan though in both cases the resulting product will be bulkier and probably heavier than the metal version as you need more material to gain similar strength  resistance to breaking. If youre really ambitious you could try making a mold and laying the components in carbon fibre. ,BdsmDIY,chfuhf9,2,t5_2src2

3253754,0,t3_2xdrs9,Youre switching terms between piping and tubing. I assume you mean tubing.  If youre looking for the bare minimum try asking an engineer. If you ask me Id say  but only because youre doing  tubing.If you do  tubing you could go as low as  and just sturdy up your design. I often hang from  x  tubing at work doing pull ups. Because  has a lot of negative space the outside needs to be thicker to stop it buckling,BdsmDIY,coz9fsw,1,t5_2src2

7489168,0,t1_d2tgyxp,It was a good price mainly because half of the material was well figured and the rest was a little bland. The bland part ended up in generic projects the rest ended up in pens and these paddles.What were you looking to make with such a figured wood?,BdsmDIY,d2th81r,2,t5_2src2
8152191,0,t3_4qx30o,Thats a decent idea if you want to take the lock out of the system. The alternative would just be to get a pair of bolt cutters  even a very cheap pair will make light work of a padlock like that or even the bracelets themselves if it came to that in an emergency.That way you can still have the advantages of a padlock but it gives your partner peace of mind that they can always get you out even if they lose the keys.,BdsmDIY,d4wkl23,9,t5_2src2
