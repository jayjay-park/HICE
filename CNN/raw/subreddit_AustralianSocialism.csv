The fact he has tried to fuck over disability support workers and now teachers says something about the Labor Party and how it treats unions. ,AustralianSocialism,ddok68m,3,t5_3hily

11130816,0,t3_5yx8gq,Questions are very welcome. Both the current CPA and the CPAML started off as splits from the original CPA. The CPAML started off in  as a proChina split from the original CPA in the aftermath of the SinoSoviet split and can generally be described as Maoist. They did some great union work in the s and s but fractured into pieces due to disagreements about political developments in China Rapprochement with Nixon Cultural Revolution. They were also hopelessly sectarian and used to physically attack other leftwing groups on the streets who dared criticize the Chinese state. The surviving remnants are extremely small and will only ever be seen in ones and twos once a year at May Day.Todays CPA started off in  as the Socialist Party of Australia a hardline Stalinst split that formed after the original CPA opposed the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and began to move towards Eurocommunism. When the original CPA fell apart in the s the Socialist Party of Australia took the name.  They were never as successful or big as the CPAML or the original CPA mostly because of their unpopular hardline support for the Soviet Union and North Korea. Despite this they have fared better than both in the long term but are still tiny and only seen in public once or twice a year. Currently their primary activity consists of running a few very anemic electoral campaigns.Hope that helps!,AustralianSocialism,deto27a,6,t5_3hily
