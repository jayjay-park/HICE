158829,0,t3_1vwsgj,Just unscrew the screws take out your gauges unplug them. Then as you see all the LEDs lit up take a soldering iron of low voltage so it doesnt get too hot. Take iron to old ones and pull them off. Put a little solder on the spots where you melted some off and then solder new LED back on. Be sure not to get LED too hot or you will burn it out. Do this over and over until you got all of them. I would recommend after your first  go plug in the gauges and check if youre doing it right. It took me around an hour and a half to do all of them but I have some soldering experience so if youve never done it before you might wanna take it slow. ,Celica,cewiuuy,2,t5_2te55

1062821,0,t3_26a50r,Keep it IMO it would make an awesome build car or keep it original and sell it on when they start to go back up in value.,Celica,chp3ikv,2,t5_2te55

3276318,0,t1_cp1pn6q,Its a small collection haha. We had an  GTS notchback early  with the funky forward flipup lights and now its my th gen GTS. Id like to get a th gen GT damn import laws and the others I mentioned wanting to build.,Celica,cp1q64o,1,t5_2te55
3534945,0,t3_2pbzqh,op follow up on this. i have the  gt engine. went ahead and removed the heat shield. rattling persisted. then went ahead and ordered a replacement timing chain tensioner. aftermarket will not fit because of how close it is to edge of blockblock mount. only a oem one will fit. replaced tensioner old one was hard to compress fully and gunked up. replaced new one. attached a  mm socket to the alternator and rotated both was until i heard a click which is the catch on the tensioner releasing. rattling is gone. ,Celica,cpv7gur,1,t5_2te55

4332070,0,t1_cqa4rnw,When it came to the wiring how did you disconnect it? It looks like the connectors are either deep inside the door or behind the dashboard. Did you have to take off all or part of the dashboard? ,Celica,csdyc83,1,t5_2te55

5964066,0,t3_3x0i57,The mr spyder steering wheel is a celica gts steering wheel so yeah itll fit. Also the corolla s had the same steering wheel and you might find those a little cheaper.,Celica,cy1f4kq,2,t5_2te55
6440119,0,t1_czlfxlq,I would say at idle it would take  minutes or longer to heat up. It takes about  minutes driving normally to heat up as well.,Celica,czlg3t5,2,t5_2te55

7482666,0,t1_d2rslqm,The wheels on my Celica are already pretty flush. Do you mean the gap from the chassis to wheel for the rear wheels?I run  inches and the front fit fine but since the back is higher up it looks like the s are tiny. Lowering it would be better than wheel spacers.,Celica,d2sqk3m,1,t5_2te55
7651575,0,t3_4k1y01,If there is actually a turbo in that car it means you are getting a rusty shell with random parts that may not be USDM or even Toyota at all. Im sure the owner of this would love to trade a pile of junk metal for a running Honda.,Celica,d3bxwol,1,t5_2te55
8642594,0,t1_d6lvwf9,Thanks years in the making. Car was a wreck when I got it. It ran well but pissed oil everywhere had no AC or power steering and had  different colors of paint. Im pretty happy with it now,Celica,d6lxn9r,2,t5_2te55
9304138,0,t3_57vm5f, GTs are notorious for their oil burning issues. The only way to really fix this is by dropping in a  zz or just upgrading to the zz. The GT came with the zz and the GTS came with the zz engine.,Celica,d8vd7tz,1,t5_2te55
