9260570,0,t3_575pi7,I use PC and can verify that you get the same amount of credits for a horizon edition car . million as on Xbox yes you can get credits for an HE car you already have and no there arent any differences the game is fully cross platform and everything is nearly identical even the lobbies are mixed with PC and Xbox players!,forzahorizon3,d8pueh1,2,t5_391yk

9388097,0,t3_592eq9,Hey I have that same CPU .GHz and I HAD that same GPU from Asus. I managed to get a stable fps with pretty bad stuttering and  weeks ago i switched my gpu for a  GB. Game runs flawlessly p fps with high to ultra details AND xMSAA no FXAA.  OF COURSE there are still the annoying buildings popping in every now and then in the city. But other than that the lowest the fps goes is . And even that is not noticeable if you dont have the FPS counter up.,forzahorizon3,d960aaa,1,t5_391yk

9613064,0,t3_5cnp33,Second this. Also I hope they add some kind of drift challenge in the future. I know we can do drift zones and see who gets the most points but I wish there was something that was a bit more organized. Something like if there are  people in it people would leave the start line at a stagger of  seconds or so. Whoever racks up the most points wins. It would add so much for us drifters. And imagine that IN a parking garage,forzahorizon3,d9y09mn,3,t5_391yk
9628057,0,t1_d9zskhi,Oh that sucks.  Only issues Ive encountered is the game will crash if I keep the painting vinyl screen open for longer than  minutes without exiting it. Lost a lot of painting that way.  Everything else though games pretty much solid.,forzahorizon3,d9zutks,1,t5_391yk

9663980,0,t1_da43nmw,It does? I never checked tbh. The map method clearly states its cost the autoshow one doesnt.    I agree it would be nice to change cars without having to drive to your desired location again afterwards without having to abuse the system.,forzahorizon3,da4ad8c,2,t5_391yk
9828955,0,t3_5cy41p,I am also at . uMankyDingo s suggestion of turning down the brightness helps immensely. Before thatI was at . Ive scoured and rescoured with icons off and using the magnifier on xbox hold down guide button til turn off menu pops up and then hit back button.Ive scoured the threads where people post screenshots of their hardest finds.Still nothing. What bugs me most about this is how the map is almost perfect but there are a handful of dirt roads that the devs muffed up on because they look incomplete or missing entirely in places despite being perfectly normal in game. A few places make sense where thick jungle would block satellite views of the road but most of them are in broad open skies.EDIT uFurryButtWorm s comment found the last road for me!,forzahorizon3,daoqgc1,2,t5_391yk

10036931,0,t3_5jdoo6,Yes it has happened since the update where you now choose the car group levels. It means all the online players are getting spread too thin through the sections. I like A class best for games and it is hard to get a game with   or more players.The players that always vote for S overpowered super cars are to blame for this thats why the update came and now its worse. ,forzahorizon3,dbfu74s,1,t5_391yk
