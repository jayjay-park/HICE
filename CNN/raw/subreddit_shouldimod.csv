409148,0,t3_1ypmb2,I am no expert by any means but from my experience its less of  do I have the right features and more of a confidencewill to get it done issue. If you are really into the piercing and like the idea to hell about any other thing and go get it! Also I should add it really depends more on where your sweet spot  is located in your nose than any other factors.  I love my septum piercing and dont regret it a bit. I think you should go for it. ,shouldimod,cfn6axu,2,t5_2vkff

698461,0,t3_225dqy,I think it would. I also think that an eyebrow piercing on the side you part your hair on would look good.,shouldimod,cgjo1j9,4,t5_2vkff
1032924,0,t3_25we0j,Im partial to septum piercings over nostril since my septum is healing better and easier. Either would look nice on your face.,shouldimod,chlp5fa,3,t5_2vkff
1078748,0,t3_26g798,If you want it you should get it! I think anyone can make just about any piercing look good if they like it.As for your anatomys suitability you should visit a reputable piercer and ask them. ,shouldimod,chqwnk1,3,t5_2vkff

1662164,0,t3_2d04uv,Ive seen lots of opal in philtrums lately but Ive never seen a turquoise stone in one! If you go with the turquoise you should post a picture I wanna see how it looks,shouldimod,cjoof53,2,t5_2vkff

2020204,0,t3_2hwic5,Cant really tell from the picture but I already have my nose pierced a dermal and my ears stretched to an inch. ,shouldimod,ckwmq65,1,t5_2vkff
2022226,0,t1_ckwuuge,Yeah the healing is my top concern for getting it thats why I asked actually just to make sure that its something worth suffering for. And I love the Dahlia piercing actually! That just made my decision a little bit harder haha. Thanks for your opinion  ,shouldimod,ckwvi5i,2,t5_2vkff
2172274,0,t3_2jwzvn,I like the nostril! ,shouldimod,clfy4hf,3,t5_2vkff

2592804,0,t3_2pdkaz,a jeweled philtrum would look hella cute and really accentuate your mouth.,shouldimod,cmx0lzv,1,t5_2vkff

3352068,0,t3_2ykk2z,On my other ear I have my tragus done. I dont usually wear earrings in my lobes. I was thinking of a conch hoop for my next piercing but I wanted opinions. ,shouldimod,cpaczmg,1,t5_2vkff
3700374,0,t3_32rwtu,Also I have my earlobes done a Tragus on my left ear helix on the right and my navel,shouldimod,cqe2fvg,1,t5_2vkff
4664144,0,t3_3esxks,Are these recent pics? If so the redness seems to indicate that they arent healed so maybe you should wait a bit?Regardless I would see the conch being pierced on the side where you have the rook and helix where you have the daith.,shouldimod,ctigybc,1,t5_2vkff
4682239,0,t3_3eztw8,If you really want an industrial there are tailored options you could go for. You could get a custom bar made a good piercer would be willing to do this for you get a vertical one if you like them I think they look cool! but guessing you prefer the horizontal! or get a floating industrial! ,shouldimod,ctkqqng,1,t5_2vkff
4702837,0,t1_ctmgo5n,For mine the sensitivity stayed about the same the only downside is that they took the longest to heal out of any piercing Ive had. They took about  months to fully heal and a bit over a year to stop the crusting. Other that that I love them and would highly recommend them. ,shouldimod,ctnbweq,1,t5_2vkff
5520097,0,t1_cvwjk33,Thank you so much I had a bunch of people on Facebook tell me Im just an asshole for asking my friends to contact the original artist or have the tattoo artist cook up a new version. As an artist myself I appreciate this advice.,shouldimod,cwh8qoi,2,t5_2vkff
6563146,0,t3_3wo65w,I think a septum would look amazing  also have you considered an eyebrow piercing?,shouldimod,czy6my3,1,t5_2vkff

10416447,0,t3_5of2zy,Get both done at once. If I had gotten only one done at a time I would have never gone back to get the second. Hurt like a bitch,shouldimod,dcortbv,3,t5_2vkff
10539050,0,t1_dd0mkik,Wow thanks for this thoughtful reply! Where do you think is the ideal location on my flat for piercing? ,shouldimod,dd2pv7f,1,t5_2vkff
10590021,0,t3_5rki0p,Aesthetically you have the perfect anatomy for a medusa. But double nostrils would also look great on you! Get all the mods! ,shouldimod,dd8a24z,7,t5_2vkff
10827068,0,t3_5usuhc,Septums always look good imo and are easy to hide. My job doesnt allow them so I keep it flipped up I even keep the ball bearings off so that its more comfy flipped up and I dont pointlessly lose ball bearings when its not even in use. ,shouldimod,ddwqhr2,3,t5_2vkff
