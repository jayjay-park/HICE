5922650,0,t3_3vtt1a,I recommend either watching Khan Academys videos or purchasing the charts from masteringorganicchemistry.com Another resource Im using to prepare for ochem  is a supplementary book called Organic Chemistry as a Second Language written by David Klein. He has books on both semester topics. Its a great investment I highly recommend it...its kinda like readers digest of organic chemistry. Good luck!,Iwannalearnchemistry,cxvzobk,2,t5_2uv7c
