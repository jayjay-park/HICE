56505,0,t3_1ur3hp,Excellent post only one bit way off imogt When performing a goal kick kick the ball exactly  bars or close to it at least. This will usually land to your CDM. Head the ball backwards to your CB. You will end up with possession about  of the time. Do this enough and with enough practice your  will get better.This I find to be somewhat inaccurate advice and certainly not the best goal kick advice. Generally I agree  two bars is usually fairly safe.  However goal kicks depend on your formation  the opposition formation.   For example I unlike  of you play  in the back almost all the time.  If you try a  in the back formation youll note that the goal kick you describe isnt openthere.  Additionally if you come up against my  that goal kick from you to your CDM wont be there. With every combination of formations  tactics there will always be at least one player wide open to receive a goal kick.  All you have to do is find that player and pay attention to see if they are running to cut it off in the future. ,FIFA,cekv341,3,t5_2qxh7

Then he turns around a gives a . to Balotelli who has  agility. If bad agility can kill the score for one player why does it not for another? Also he changes his standards for a lot of players.

The rightleft CAM positions play a lot like wingers and Tevezs HH tends to work well.HH workrates are no good for the center CAM spot because the HH player contributes too much in defense and isnt there for the outlet pass. If you threw Mertens in centrally you would effectively have a second striker HL. Problem with Rossi and Mertens in the center is strength. If I were you I would sell Rossi or Mertens move Tevez and slot IF TottiHamsikHernanes centrally.Gomez is a beast. PaceStrHeading.

All these top people playing each other on YouTube for wagers literally have a  chance of winning or losing.In Halo for example I have one friend who would always beat all of my group of about  people. He played for a semi pro team. Then next down there was me I could beat everyone reliably apart from him. Yet  a pro in the MLG league would destroy my semi pro friend every time. And within that there is many more levels of skill you can be.Thats why Halo was actually a MLG game for ages because the game was skill based thats how the multiplayer was massive. In FIFA I dont think it is because its competitive its probably because of ultimate team. I think people want to to have the most valuable team and they like the customisation so they keep playing.,FIFA,cf4gak2,-1,t5_2qxh7

I can predict the player he passing to most of the time but cant switch to them and defend in time to tackle or intercept. It either switches to the wrong player or the wont move in front of the receiving player it sounds weird I know.I use both the LB and RS method of switching players and neither seems as accurate as I would hope.

281964,0,t1_cf9xrwe,from what I gather its that when faced with having to take a touch in a  area they spring make a motion averting the situation at the very last possible second and the passes even with a such a small window get it off. The chances theyre creating are pretty smooth in that when given the opportunity to get near the goal they capitalize. Also the usage of the obnoxious long through ball constantly is dismantled because if you notice the defense lays off until they enter there half and the player in white uses his AI assist to press while he manually tracks the runner. However while their mechanics of attack and build up are rather sharp theyre not attacking the middle of the field unless theres a big opening or defense isnt in good position. Instead like every other person in this game when presented with the opportunity to go at goal or sprint to the wing for a cross the cross was almost always taken. Also both teams use most of the fastest players on Madrid with Ronaldo at striker jese and di maria on the wing and Benzema as a CAM. Basically what I see is that on any level if you want win obviously you need good decision making and timing to take the next step upwards however even the best show that fast players and crossing the ball is the best play of attack to build on,FIFA,cf9zm9d,2,t5_2qxh7

With his pace and strength you might be able to cut into the box easily with a good partnership on the wing but thats really your call.I was actually telling you to get Rooney for Gerrard which in retrospect might not be very intelligent.

Example buy a card you can sell for k for kdo this x with k of your kthen when you sell youll have made profit of .Keys  PATIENCE both when buying and selling. be willing to wait for the right deal and be willing to let a card sit for multiple cycles to get the optimal profit. Knowing the market. Pick a player and know the going price and be sure to know what they will ACTUALLY sell for not just what the current lowest BIN is. sometimes esp during nonpeak hours a player will have a higher BIN than they will actually sell for this can be due to any number of factors the randomness of how players are listedbought temporary lull in listing someone trying to pricefix whatever. Just become an expert in a few players to start off with and youll get the hang of it after a while.There is no easy way make k off of k other than methods like this.

804006,0,t1_cgvderw,I had a  and now I have  but the problem is exactly the same on both. I do all of that stuff but still get to games where I cant do anything because the pressure makes the whole opposition team into TOTY Silvas. The quick passes always end up with an innacurate pass even though my mids all have  short passing. I do switch wings very often but most times it doesnt do much and all my pass options are marked somehow. The most annoying is that I cant dribble by them with players like Lucas and Cuadrado who should be well capable to do that. Its really frustrating because Im not a beginner now Ive been playing since the game came out and at times Ive been able to handle pressure fine but more and more Im coming up against simply undefeatable opponents.

805997,0,t1_cgvvqse,Im on PS... Link me to the video you are talking about. Dont you find it odd that the biggest complaints are the people losing to headers? That tells me they are shit at defending. I believe there is a massive variety of skill levels on the rfifa. Just like there is massive variety of skill levels in real life. If I put your chubby ass against Semipro level players... They will smash headers on you all day. Easy. Technique can be developed but skill level is another argument... The kid you played may not have been a high level player. So really your argument is a fallacy. People will try to abuse whatever easy tactic they think is op and running down the wing and lobbing through balls is EASY. When you look at high level FIFA players... They do not play the same. Most people who play FIFA are low level players and have undeveloped skills. They make simple mistakes that can be corrected. I dont give a shit if you believe me or not... but I rarely concede headers... including corners. Does it happen? Yes... no one is perfect and you shouldnt expect a game to be... Especially when you have ZERO impact on the process... You want a better game... Then go make one. Its really that simple. I appreciate FIFA because Ive played it ever since Super Nintendo. Im also not an entitled cunt who complains every other post about a game I didnt create. Headers can be stopped. I wont respond to any other posts of yours unless you are reasonable.

860047,0,t1_ch1pt53,Exactly that. Im afraid of IFs now. I also lost the connection to Origin  times after winning the cup finals and instead of  the reward I got DNF. Also a few times I was fighting to stay in the division and had  games and had to win one. Then at the end of the game after I won and felt relieved I lost connection to Origin and instead of getting those three points or having one more chance Ive been relegated with  points needed to stay in the division and one more game left.

860496,0,t1_ch22rug,In my experience pace in defense doesnt guarantee you a W. Ive found that good positioning is the absolute best way to defend in this game. I realize Rami has HM workrate which may cause him to be out of position but thats nothing a manual positioning cant fix plus the HM workrate will make him come in clutch where you might lose possession. Hell be there to regain it on a fastbreak. This formation allows for high pressure attacking. The defense is vulnerable in terms of pace sure but your odds of chasing a winger up the pitch and defending a cross is VERY slim. Lets face it. A well positioned defender with  HEA is a better shot at defending the header from a cross than a  pace Clichy running up the wing and blocking the cross from ever happening. Itll never happen  youll never block the cross. What this scenario usually plays out as is Winger ran up the wing. You chase em.. He crosses anyway and you have  CBs in the box trying to defend the header. So why not ?  With this formation you can fuck off with that wing and just draw your defender into the box to be the rd player assisting with HEA defense or rebound clearance. Ive honestly defended WAAAY more crosses this way rather than chasing the winger praying to block a cross.. You know and I know that youre not going to block crosses. You can easily def a HEA with more players in the box than just trying to run up the wing blocking the cross.   As for Sissoko the nice thing about that position is that its highly interchangeable and replaceable with several other great players. Payet Ben Arfa and Biabiany and such. I chose Sissoko for the DEF alone. He has better DEF than Ben Arfa and Biabiany. ,FIFA,ch23dnc,0,t5_2qxh7

One of the best was the opponent had a shot that would have been easy for my keeper but he didnt even move at all just froze and the ball just bounced off of him and into the goal then he made a dive for it.

887867,0,t1_ch52epx,Just use your false nine as a pivot playing passes of him. For example when you see youre about to do an LX pass Hit and run basically with your false nine quickly pass it back the same way with the player you passed it to and then hit it back with your cf instead of just playing a through ball with your CF first time. Most people never expect this double  and should get you a chance a couple times until your opponent figures it out at which point you can alternate between them and normal s and if you use enough different moves such as that your opponent wont know which one to prepare for and you should get chances galore.For your CF instead of having a midfielder I dont know who you used such as SIF Rakitic Draxler Kroos Gundogan and all the others that get mentioned use someone who is genuinely a CF in real life such as Giovinco Isco IF Totti definitely recommend him especially as a pivot Rossi Suarez IF Dos Santos IF Vela SIF Sterling and many many more. You also dont want to use too pure a striker such as Benzema as you end up playing like normal just with your ST coming in late every attack. Jovetic Van Persie and Rooney are borderline as they have played similar roles IRL. Your wingers should basically be strikers i.e Vela El Shaarawy Walcott and David Villa not surprisingly Pedro and Alexis as well and such are perfect but if you want to play one winger who is more of a pure winger thats alright and dont sweat about which foot they use too much as they end up as strikers.Your perfect CDMs for this formation are players like Yaya Toure De Rossi and Xabi Alonso. For your CMs use whoever you fancy just dont get players that will overshadow your CF too much as you want him to be your main man. Good passing and dribbling is your priority in any of the midfield positions for the wingers its Pace and finishing sacrificing Pace for finishing is OK but not the other way e.g Villa is very good in a F but Bolly isnt. That should just about get you started on a false nine!Sorry for the wall of text i get carried away talking football.,FIFA,ch57cjh,2,t5_2qxh7

944665,0,t3_24wopx,Heres my experience you can check my other posts for the pictures and screenshots to prove it  people sometimes comment without the experienceThe Ligue  TOTS is a ways off  in the meantime it seems most people with cash are trying out the TOTS players and trading them. For this they sell their current expensive players because a blue card looks nicer than a black one.Basically the price of Ibra drops for example during the BPL TOTW SIF and TIF Ibras were going for .m and .m respectively now they are up around . and .m. Id bet good money that during the Budesliga TOTS or the next one that generates interest the same cycle will repeat.I owned his SIF but sold as the market was high for him yesterday for the Budesliga TOTS  he is the best player ive ever played with and Ive played with a lot of the great ones. Id monitor Ibras price during the first  days of the TOTS and get him  on the weekend you should be able to sell him for no loss k over your investment which would pay the EA tax,FIFA,chbny79,2,t5_2qxh7

I actually had to play a ton of games to get Schurrle David Luiz Cech. It was a ton of fun. Ive been grinding for Eden Hazard for months but his price actually keeps going up had the money at one point but thought it was too expensive k at that time. Then the winter upgrade came and he actually hit form and got popular.   Its fun to play with the players you actually know in and out instead of playing Benteke who feels me very neutral.  Main reason is that seasons is absolute crap due to playing against only  teams and the fact I actually CANNOT play it because of the patch differences.,FIFA,cher63z,1,t5_2qxh7

You have to adjust everything all the time to maximizie your profits you have to constantly check prices and so on so its not worth the effort.Also  of the people who have bought autobuyers and bidders kept complaining that the stuff did not work properly which it did.Also the FUT Millionaire Mike Miranda stuff is absolute bullshit. Its just all trading tipps and tricks collected over the years put together in one website. The autobuyers and bidders do never work properly AND they got me banned within  weeks. I havent even started making profit back then.So Ive tested most of the available Autobuyers and Autobidders and I have to say I havent used every single buyer bidder for longer than  weeks. Why ? It was as much work as normal trading and if you enter a digit to much by accident well congratulations if you fuck up your going to buy  overprized mertesackers or gerards... So you can loose all of your coins within  seconds.Im sure many people will tell me to go and fck off because of using autobuyers but hey I wanted to become a FUT Millionaire and really play my dreamteam.

Maybe this makes up for the inability to play a team closer to yours in skill but if you buy packs or coins you should not be penalized for having a better team.  In regular tournaments you play teams similar to yours in skill and if this is supposed to make up for that then how does that incentivize people to pay money for packs and coins if in the end it will make no difference?  ,FIFA,chnmrnc,1,t5_2qxh7

1054950,0,t1_chnto1b,Nice analysis. I completely agree. It really does just come down to basic economics. While there are multiple coin sellers competing for our business they have a monopoly on the player market. If you want to buy expensive players either you slave to the grind and mass bid or invest or you buy coins. Looking for deals is nearly impossible because the th minute method has been lost. Reason being that autobuyers both . Slow the market down making it impossible to get to the th minute and . Because by the time you even get to the th minute any deal will be snatched up within seconds.Surely there are other ways to get deals but it really takes a serious stroke of luck and timing for some of the crazy deals you see pop up. Ive never gotten a deal like the ones you see on this subreddit but I think they happen because people are so fed up with parameters that they will just search general players and skip over possible deals due to the amount of players you have to shift through to find any open bidslow BINsGoing back to autobuyers though people on this subreddit like to say autobuyers have no effect on player prices blah blah not everyone just a select few nincompoops. I say stat wise its clear that things have changed for the worse with the influx of coin sellers and available autobuyers on the Internet. Just look at the progression of prices since FIFA . Ibrahimovic went for k Messi went for something like k and Ronaldo was maybe k. Have their ratingscard weightspopularity changed over the past few years? Not really. So why do they cost so much now? Why did Ibra go from k to k in FIFA  and then from k to  million in FIFA ? The answer is coin sellers basically control the markets.You could argue the amount of people who play UT has drastically increased over the course of the last three years but I dont think that really explains the massive divide in player prices between those that are the million dollar players and the cheap high quality players you see going for cheaper than k. The idea of the ultimate team is so popularized that people feel obligated to spend real money in order to accelerate the process to which you can create an ultimate team. Its become the only way for a casual FIFA player to try out any of these players. I know this year Ive been sucked in pretty badly with both FIFA points and buying a bit of coins as well because I love FIFA but it frustrates me so much to not be able to do any of the trading methods Ive used in past FIFAs besides investing in consumables and mass bidding its just not fun.I am seriously enjoying having the web app down been a pleasure to use parameters again and having the ability to build a team in a reasonable amount of time rather than the hour it took me before.,FIFA,cho7b08,0,t5_2qxh7

1059897,0,t3_2683ij,This is the way soccer is. The more talented team doesnt always win and counter attacks are often lethal. To keep possession youve got to understand when to pass and through ball. Often times Ill tap triangle PS instead of X when passing in the midfield because that makes your players run into space. One touch passing works really well here too but you have to get really good at it because turnovers in possession can turn into a lethal counter attack from your opponent. Look at your forwards and tap L and send them on a run and if its covered that run will open up space elsewhere. And understand how to use L  X.,FIFA,chorjfj,0,t5_2qxh7

Then match them up against players with  in each category. And try different strategies. Quick sim like  games each to get a statistically valuable number. Basically the idea was to tinker with stuff. Simulate a bunch of games. And post the result.So Man City in  vs Chelsea  games. Man City in  vs Chelsea in  games. Man City  vs Chelsea in  games. Make sure only one variable changes. Perhaps make it like so they are doing short passing for  games and then short passing for  games.I think that would have been pretty neat. Only issue I ran into the Match Engine was different for instant results. So I would actually have to simulate each round. Which would take FOREEEVER.Not a bad idea nonetheless. ,FIFA,chygsob,2,t5_2qxh7

1150386,0,t1_chyy0j2,A I said it would not be as straight forward as with coins but its definitely doable.As it is now it wouldnt be able to learn what stuff is worth since trade offers arent public so the data cant be mined and then used to determine what a common trade for a specific player is. Unless theres some sort of looking for function.It would take some human maintenance but having a bot trading in maybe  players it wouldnt be a big job to maintain some sort of positive list it can accept for these players. Since no definite value is assigned to a player I think its fair to assume that we would see some lopsided deals since its a perceived value a player has.Combined with mining what players are traded the most I could imagine a bot mass posting trades for high volume players where it targets slightly higher valued players.An example could be zil vs. Mata. Both have roughly the same value in coins but their perceived value is different in many peoples eyes. So getting hold of zils and trading them for Matas would be a way to increase the value of your cards as the real money value of the  probably would be different.I dont know if this would happen but I dont think its far fetched to see player sellers popping up if coins were removed.,FIFA,chz168i,1,t5_2qxh7

1195653,0,t1_ci434zo,LONG story of how I got into soccer incomingFor me I had started playing soccer around the time of early April of last year.  A LOT of my family played FIFA at the time and I was never really good at it so I always stuck to playing games like Garrys mod on PC.  Then one day my brother was playing a bronze in FIFA  tournament and was called to go help our neighbor he told my to finish the game the final and I did.  It was  when I started and  when it ended.  I started playing FIFA  and I had a ArgentineanMexico team.  At the time I didnt know anything internationally  and didnt have a favorite club so I joined the bandwagon of everyone at my school and assumed Mexico was the best international team and that Barcelona was my favorite team it isnt anymore. Then  came out and I started playing right away I made a cheap little k it was k at the time Brazilian team with players like Manoel Danilo Dias Julio Cesar Adriano.  Then I started getting better players like Fred Kaka Ronaldinho.  I think I determined my favorite player when I was watching an international match of Brazil vs Uruguay.  After the match I talked to my sister about it and she asked me how good I though Hulk was.  I still wasnt sure so I went back and re watched the game and I for some reason thought Thiago Silva was Hulk.  Like when ever someone would say Hulk I automatically thought of Thiago silva because he was the only face I remembered seeing during the game.  After I realized he wasnt hulk I did some research on Silva to see who he was what teams he played for and such.  IMO he played the best that game and me being a Center back when I play for my team really enjoyed watching him.  Then he became my favorite player and PSG is now my favorite team. Now that FIFA  is out and IV played it so much I too can recognize almost anyone I see playing on tv due to FIFA.  If it was for FIFA I wouldnt know anything about soccer or who anyone was.  Im not sure why but I really like my story of how I found a favorite player and team...,FIFA,ci44o3s,13,t5_2qxh7

He misses every sitter every longshot goes off the crossbar and every time I try to do some skills I get absolutely raped by  defenders and poor Ibra is thrown to the ground. I have barely won half of the games I play against shitty teams and I have no understanding why. The defense is what is really shitty about this team. I concede about  goals a game to through balls and corners alone and no matter what I do every single team torches my defense. I just played a  chemistry team with negredo and fernando torres and while Ibra got a hatrick he won  off of through balls and crosses my defense has never been so wide open.

1431793,0,t3_2aj0zf,In my opinion its not worth it. From what I can tell you get  gold packs for preordering FIFA  and  for preordering FIFA  Ultimate Edition. Technically  extra gold packs would cost you a lot more than the extra  but to me this doesnt change the fact that  extra gold packs arent worth spending  for because packs are a ripoff in general. The first few weeks of the games release are the most critical and since the regular edition will have you covered for  weeks thats almost four months where theres no significant advantage in having the Ultimate Edition. It will only come into play at the th week by which point the items you get out of the packs will have relatively little value because the market will already be saturated. A bonus gold pack per week from January gt July is worth maybe k per week. Probably less than that if its not premium gold. Not worth it in my book though I simply loathe giving EA money in general. ,FIFA,civr2ui,2,t5_2qxh7

If that gives you any indication. Regular seasons arent bad and all you can do on fut is seasons tournaments are dead no matter what time even the new tourneys they release for special things dont get played I made a full bundesliga team for the season close tourney and couldnt even play it because no one does them. The wc mode died within the first week too. Basically if you are ok with just seasons in regular and fut youll be ok most of the time you can find a game easy within a min. Depending on the time of day and other variables it can take longer like an hour to find a green bar game. For some reason no on in the US plays on PC its all South America.

1450086,0,t3_2arh49,There is something called the transfer market in FIFA Ultimate Team.. Pretty much a place to buy sell and trade players. You buy the players you can afford use them and hopefully sell them for a profit so that you can buy better players. You can build your squad however you want but there is something called chemistry where players play better when they are linked with other players of the same nationality andor league. You can play online against real people offline against the CPU or onlineoffline in tournaments. I personally think the extra  is worth it because you get  pack per week for the year. You open packs to get players and other things to help your players. Opening packs are completely based on lucksometimes youll get someone REALLY good sometimes youll get a bunch of noname losers but for  its worth it. Plus you get to use Messi for your first  matches which is cool if youre new you probably wont be able to afford Messi for awhile if youre just starting out.

1545956,0,t1_cj9glo3,Well yeah its successful when a good portion of your team is made up of players that have the most abused and OP aspect of the game. Youre going to get to balls faster be able to burn opposing defenders by using no sort of skill or strategy at all and more. And thats a good team but still a tad bit on the pacey side. But I will give you credit for using good players and not just people like Walker who are mainly just used for their speed. But wow you just proved my point exactly. You just said it seemed more difficult to create chances with slower strikers. Youre right it takes more skill and tactics to set them up. Ive used RvP Rooney and Mandzukic a lot and found them all to be great strikers in a . They arent meant to be used for pace theyre meant to be used as goal scorers that a skilled player will find tons of success with. There are actually a ton of great players who arent pacey. I mean you have Schweinsteiger in one squad. Hes a great slow player. Pace is definitely OP but the top FIFA players are the ones who can win without abusing it. And no you didnt offend me at all. I never explicitly said or implied that you did in any way. And I really dont care what kind of team you use but I dont recommend listening to nor will I follow the tactical advice from someone using such a sweaty team. I think youre the one so offended and Im sorry for that but Im just staying my opinion about this thread which is the point of comments. ,FIFA,cja2559,2,t5_2qxh7

Because a lot of people are just out there trying to abuse the game. If you dont play against guys that just run down the wings and play crosses in the box over and over again its not so awful.

The defense for the most part is pretty solid however as you move up in divisions you are going to run into a lot of pacey strikers so I would suggest replacing your CBs with players like Gary Cahill and Smalling however if you do keep the slower CBs it will be very important to switch to Defensive at the beginning of each game to cope with the faster players. ,FIFA,cjf9i3s,1,t5_2qxh7

1902125,0,t3_2emu0j,If you dont want to waste money on packs this is what Id do. The web app is available on Wedesday th September  days before the game is released.. As mentioned nothing transfers from  to  and I doubt fifa points will either so dont take the risk. I doubt youll be able to use them straight away anyway so wait until you can if you really want to spend money. It only takes a second so no rush.. Based on the years Ive played you start with packs in FUT. You get a few starter packs and then everyone gets a few more depending on their EA Sports level or whatever its called.. Become self sufficient. By this I mean get your FUT club in a position that you need to spend NO money. If you are willing to spend money a good step is to buy the season ticket and UT version of the game to get more free packs but you can do it without.. Sell everything you can from the starter packs. Depending on your level you could get between k k. By sell everything you can I mean as mentioned by others if you get a good player  or someone OP keep them as their price will rise but sell all the shit.. As I said once you sell the shit youll have on average k. Use this to buy your starter team for k max then buy managers that get you up to  extra contracts which I believe is still the max allowed. Youll see some managers give you a contract bonus. Buy enough to give  in the cheapest possible way to almost never have to buy a contract again.. You have a starter team managers should cost k to get the  and a stadium etc. You should have at least k left and a lot more if youre spending money. Now just play lots and buy all of the items mentioned on the thread low then sell them high. Contracts for  popular chemistry styles and cheap players. With players start with cheap popular ones though some like to just stay with contracts etc in high volumes. Players wise BPL is always a good shout. E.G last year it was very easy to buy Patrice Evra late at night for  and sell for  next day. If youre willing to trade you can make a lot. . If you trade your k for even an hour a day you should make around k a week while playing games and not having to buy many contracts. I always try not to buy fitness cards either. After a few games online if players are tired Ill play one game offline with subs etc. Even with a shit team with out of position players youll win and make money rather than spending any. It makes a big difference.. After a week or so of playing youll have money to buy better players for your team. Spend around half on new players and half on trading up on whatever youre most comfortable with. Once you have enough money you can start looking at bigger players. I like looking at players like Iniesta Rooney Toure etc and buying them low selling high. Just find a website that has price graphs and buy when low and only sell higher. Remember EA take  too! Do this for all players though this is VERY IMPORTANT. If you buy players you want for top prices you will lose money on them simple as that. As I said just check a graph and be willing to be patient.. Be sustainable trade up small to start with then get bigger if youre comfortable play lots of games and refrain from buying fitness or contract cards. The more you trade the more youll make but on average you should earn at least k a week. Buying big players cheap then making profits and using other techniques like the min can make lots more. Buy late at night sell between pmpm UK time when kids get home from school.And its true prices will fly up when the game comes out. Remember you have  days from when the web app comes out to make a club trade up and buy popular players cheap before everyone buys the game and are willing to pay top prices for them.,FIFA,ckie821,2,t5_2qxh7

Essentially not only are the AI superpowered but your entire team and its players are handicapped from the get go!Your massivestrongest players like SilvaZlatan get shoved out of the way instantly and not even a little bit sometimes its like theyre shoved back a good  yards! They just keep getting pushed and pushed and you cant get the ball back.Your guys all of a sudden stop running even the Paciest players feel slow especially when approaching the box they just slow down and get clumsy.You cannot win a tackle no matter what you do it either magically bounces back to opposing team or you fall over or get shoved a million yards back.AI is able to outmaneuver you in every single case and situation they always catch up and they get goals from the most ridiculous angles.Can someone say Scripted? Instead of improving their AI what EA loves to do is just handicap your gameplay.I mean Ive even had my player the one Im supposed to be controlling all of a sudden start moving on his own away from the ball possessor or away from the corner..

2071980,0,t1_cl34am8,is that really the case? my guess is that most players would increase slightly in price due to the price inflation caused by winning match coins.  EA tax is more of a deflationary regulation than anything else and id find it hard to believe that deflationary forces like the  EA tax would be enough to cause a decrease in prices overall  but then again i only started playing FUT in June so maybe im wrong! i guess the counterargument is that the increasing supply of FUT players over time increases the supply of cards and with a smaller relative increase in demand for a card the price would drop. but i feel like the demands for cards increase too as people get more coins from playing matches...idk im unsure tbh,FIFA,cl3701r,2,t5_2qxh7

2084842,0,t3_2iri1b,This is the squad I use.Ive used different variations of this squad and found this one to work the best as far as work rates and players per position. At ST Tevez and Palacio are both really great finishers. Palacio for k coins is a steal. Tevez is one of the best players I have used in the game. I think his HH work rates benefits this formation because he drops further back with allows him to work more as a CM with Palacio actings as a solo ST.At CAM I think Vidal has been amazing. I know some people would prefer Pogba or other pacier options but for this formation I wanted someone who could dominate the middle. Vidal is a machine imo.At RMLM Asamoah and Lichtsteiner are basically made for this role. HH work rates mean they contribute on both sides of the ball. They are both physical and well rounded enough to hold possession. Lichtsteiner is a turnover beast.At CDM Medel and De rossi are both strong defensive players. Medel is a steal at  coins and his LH work rates always leave him in a position to defend counter attacks. I had De jong in De rossis spot and prefer De rossi slightly due to being more well rounded. At CB Chiellini is probably the best CB in Serie A. Barzagli just didnt play well for me despite having great stats. Jesus and Cceres work great in their roles. So basically the Work rates allows me to have  players who actively contribute while on defense. This squad is great for slow build up or counter attacking tactics. ,FIFA,cl4tuxv,2,t5_2qxh7

I believe banning sellers is the right way to go I stopped my buyer a few months ago in April as I no longer needed to earn beer money. ,FIFA,cleoghu,1,t5_2qxh7

2167880,0,t1_cleffvo,You do realise that FUT isnt the only game mode right? For years FIFA has existed without FUT and has been able to afford licencing  costs for most leagues and their players. Get one thing straight... FIFA is not FUT. FUT is a game mode that didnt exist a few years back and that didnt stop them from improving the game. Candy Crush Saga makes a billion dollars for King using the same business model. You think all those billions of dollars go into making that game better. Dont come around making comments when you know fuck all about what companies even publicly traded companies do with money. And if you think that it does not go into execs pockets think about this...more profits means higher dividends for shareholders which leads to higher share prices which leads to higher bonuses for the execs. Another way to do it is the company can use liquid cash to buy back its shares and increase the value of the shares which leads to bonuses for the execs. Other uses for liquid cash is to move it around to derisk and cover losses of disasters such as Battlefield . Dont delude yourself that EA doesnt already make enough money to improve FIFA through sales of the game itself because that was enough for many years. ,FIFA,clfdzdm,0,t5_2qxh7

I would have put Sissoko in there but hes a RM this year so Diaby will have to do.

2212991,0,t3_2kfutv,Im almost positive that EA determines almost every player you get in packs as Im guessing there are about  different pack weights that they use to determine what players you get. I mean let be honest. Opening packs is probably worse than playing a slot machine as you actually get a cash payout from a slot machine. Im sure theres a ton of psychology to go with the pack and it might even combine with their matchmaking trying to get you frustrated from playing get you to open packs and maybe thats when you get some incredible player. Then they program you to think that way only for you to get more disappointed.I dunno. We know absolutely nothing about FUT at this point so who knows.All I know is that after the patch came out Im not even having fun playing this game anymore. It feels so much slower and players like Bale a guy I saved for and worked my ass off trading for just feels so heavily nerfed now. Its like FIFA  all over again a game I absolutely hated except without the op heading. Sure maybe its more realistic now but it isnt as fun.

2225081,0,t3_2kkbxq,I hate Fifa  but always come back to it after Ive cooled down after some online bullshit. First of all Ive been playing Fifa on Xbox since  and havent had a problem you win some you lose some. This iteration however is the pinnacle of broken...The single player is fun you chose a difficulty and play career mode manager mode whatever. Online however the most broken arse piece of shit Ive ever experienced in a Fifa game. I play Ultimate Team If you are a regular on this thread youll know where this is heading... The servers are shocking I find myself with a few minutes to spare so Ill go play UT. So I make sure my squad is fit and ready advance to the game waiting... waiting... I have mb broadband so I dont understand the issue Finally an opponent! Or is it..? Opponent has left the game Great Ill start over. same thing happens again and again. buy now Im getting pretty impatient and this usually takes about  minutes for such a simple task Im sure with the amount of people playing Fifa it wouldnt be such a problem. Anyway I finally get an opponent and the game starts I get a glimpse of the opponents team Doumbia or Emeneke or Immobile Seriously why does everyone have these three players? Did I miss something?!The game starts the first issue occurs WHY THE FUCK DOES NO ONE SKIP THE OPENING CLIP OF THE GAME???!?!! Honestly guys all you have to do is press A or X its really not that hard!Second problem the lag oh god the lag. Its fine at first then it slowly comes into play. Just when you get the upper hand on your opponent LAG STRIKES! The game freezes slightly for second intervals causing the pace of the match to almost grind to a halt. And if you were pressing a button its either not going to register or it will just go full power causing the ball to shoot off in some random direction completely destroying your run of play. This doesnt happen the once This happens constantly throughout the match almost as if its timed. Third issue Defending. I know this is a grey area some people say its been made more realistic and some say its broken. Im inclined to fall into the latter. Ive lost games buy  goals because of the way defending is represented in Fifa  if I was playing apology rules Id be making a lot of sandwiches. Anyway it seems that everytime the opponents striker recieves the ball he has anything but a hard time from my defence sometimes skipping past as if theyre not even there! Even when I try to tackle the ball off of the striker either nothing happens or I concede a free kick. Also why do all defenders run like they have lead boots on or look like they are rooted to the spot? These are the main reasons that through balls always reach their targets and my defenders are left in the dust. I like how EA have made the game more realistic but this is ridiculous This behaviour from the defenders would not be seen in a real match theyd be out of a job. If it wasnt for the fact that Xbox one controllers are  a piece my bedroom would be an elephant graveyard of smashed peripherals.This isnt a game issue as such more like a pet peeve I mentioned earlier that people didnt skip the opening clip? These same people do not skip replays. Its so god damn annoying why would I want to see your goal from five different angles? I saw it the first time I hated it the first time I hate it even more when you force me to watch it several times afterwards. If you dont skip the replays after scoring I hope your console spontaneously combusts and blows up in your face that way Ill probably win a match.Forth problem the passing. How hard is it to pass to the player making a run? Its not. On numerous occasions my midfielder will have the ball a striker is making a run towards the box I whack Y to pass a through ball towards him. Where does the player pass to? Not the striker making the run no another midfielder clearly being marked. The pass will be intercepted by this player hell skip past my stupid defence and score this happens about  of the time. Its like the passing has a mind of its own and chooses the pass for you. If I wanted to pass to the player being marked god knows why Id pass to him!Anyway thats my beef with Fifa  quite a lot as you can see. Ive read a lot of other threads and comments that correlate with mine and Im clearly not alone with these issues. Im sure after time I will get used to the new mechanics probably when Fifa  rears its ugly head and then Ill complain about that one as well.If you stuck around to read this rant thank you and I hope it was entertaining for you.Xbox GT xDannyDx,FIFA,clmntp7,3,t5_2qxh7

2227764,0,t1_clmilnh,The other couple of things I do Set my team to defensive basically meaning youll have a deeper back line and make it harder to get over the top through balls through.  When they do put the ball over the top run a player between the op player the goal this should slow them down or at least stop a one on one Then I usually call in another player as long as there not marking another player to come and pressuretackle Ibarbo or whoever has the ball. I find it really comes down to forcing them into low percentage shots in which case they will probably miss or your keeper will have a far better chance of stopping it than a one on one. I recently went through several matches in div  without conceding a goal using this method. Once you nullifying over the top through balls to speeders and stop the center kick of run in and score goals youll go a long way to beating a lot of opponents who dont seem to have many attacking strategies outside of this. ,FIFA,cln032j,1,t5_2qxh7

2353673,0,t1_cm2i5pm,Nobody said youre breaking any rules. A majority of people dont want to sit and play those broken players every single game though.Ive won plenty of games against them as well. That doesnt change the fact that even with some of the fastest defenders in the game youre still going to get outrun by  sprint speed Doumbia  sprint speed Ibarbo or beat to the ball and then pushed off it by  sprint speed strength Emenike. When  teams that you play in the middle divisions are all featuring at least one of those players it pretty much ruins the game especially for more casual players.Theres nothing wrong with the way I play. Pace is the easiest way to win in this game. Case in point I beat almost everyone I play with my MLS team. Why? Because between my two strikers they average  sprint speed and I can use DoumbiaEmenike tactics with them since theyre built to counter. With all my other squads I play possession and can beat pretty much any squad that isnt just lobbing balls over top to overly pacey strikers. Maybe if I was that invested in being a FIFA pro like you and all your youtubers and streamers I would sit and watch game tape while icing my thumbs at night and figure out the perfect way to counter pace with anything but pace. But frankly I dont care that much. Id just much rather be able to play FUT and play against people who actually understand something other than a long ball over the top when I have time to play a few matches. Sadly that doesnt exist.Everybodys run into the person with a full TOTY team who didnt know how to play the game.

2431609,0,t3_2nc01t,Theres no real reason for IF cards to fall in my opinion since they are no longer in packs. The reason the market crash is expected is because there is going to be a special Messi card most likely and a lot of people will sell their teams to get coins to buy as many packs as possible.So the combination of selling teams and lots of packs getting opened equals a lot of extra cards on the market thus driving down prices. The only reason IFs would fall would be if people also panic sold those to afford more packs but most people holding onto IFs are either people who have invested in them and thus know there is no point in selling just now or those you use them in their teams and sell them. I dont think there will be enough new IF cards on the market to drive their prices down.Of course I could be horribly wrong. ,FIFA,cmc95cj,1,t5_2qxh7

So even though the sales numbers of ps and xbox are similar there more gamers on . the reason this matter is that is the market are joined so the xbox market still has more fifa player however if it was next gen only market PS will have way cheaper prices than what the xbox has now because there are about  million xbox and  million ps... and fifa has sold way more on ps than xbox. the only way this could change is either ps keeps selling to xbox or they introduce legends or both,FIFA,cmdy4nz,3,t5_2qxh7

2451893,0,t1_cmeoghp,Im glad the front two are working out. As for Tevez you sacrifice some of his goal scoring when you put him at cam. But I think there are ways you can play to make him one of the most effective CAMs. I would take advantage of his strength and stamina to win balls in the other half. I would say his only let down as a cam is his long passing which can be a detriment. I would try to keep short give and gos to open up the attack. As youve said he has a screamer with an amazing finesse so the CAMs in  front formation will often be found at the edge of the box.Beware that he only has  star skill moves so try to abuse roulette and LLT shielding. Hes very hard to knock off the ball. Good too see its working out tho. What is the team you are running now?,FIFA,cmer9pt,1,t5_2qxh7

A OVR player can one time a fucking rocket  meters curved around defenders perfect on the foot to someone probably Doumbia who just taps it in across your goalie.

People always bang on about IF trading because of the huge IF fluctuations. Take SIF Griezmann as an example on PS his lowest BIN started around K when he was released then fell to K on Boxing Day and has since risen to K as Im writing this. If youd managed to get him for around K then youd currently be sitting on a profit of K tax deducted.

2809759,0,t3_2s9ppf,I used this squad from div  to div  because I wanted the rest of my coins for trading Very balanced. Never used Ibarbo but you can put him in if you want more pace rossi and palacio have been amazing for me though. If you lack in attack switch to . This is my favourite formation but needs you to be good at defending. This could work as your fitness squad The most OP player this year is Chikhaoui so pick him up for discard price and sub him on when youre struggling. Also Giovinco is very OP this year so he would make a good sub.Near post is the way to go if you struggle at finishing. Power shots also seem to be most effective if your players havent got incredible finishing. Learn basic skill moves as they help you a lot in higher divisions. And most importantly be unpredictable in attack if you want to succeed.,FIFA,cnnglpq,3,t5_2qxh7

Ive never yet to break even from fifa point bought packs. Sure buying coins is against the TOS but it also feels nice to actually get something for the real life money i invested. Maybe EA should start selling coins like Diablo  did with gold in RMAH. Allow players to sell coins to each other via real life money through games own system and the company would take a  cut of every purchase done. This way they could really fight back. However this would also mean that FIFA Points would also need to be cheaper. It would totally change the economy and most likely reducing prices would only make more profit.

2879483,0,t1_cnvdw3t, sprint with...  ACCELERATION! Ronaldo has  speed with  acceleration. So in theory the moment you press the sprint button with Ronaldo it would take but an instant for him to get to  sprint while Boateng would take  seconds reasonably speaking. Now rewatch the clip and take into consideration Ronaldos and Boatengs pace stats as well as their positioning at the moment of the case. If we use simple logic to make a conclusion based purely on what we just saw Boatengs actual acceleration is more like  instead of . But since we know there is no such a thing as  acceleration we can logically conclude what we just saw is an example of... HANDICAPPING!,FIFA,cnvedqz,-2,t5_2qxh7

2888594,0,t1_cnwcfys,I think there is a really easy way to be honest and thats to detect how many coins someone earns from matches. If you look at the leaderboards there are people who have earned  coins in matches over the last month and they all have an account name made up of two random words and a series of random numbers. Assuming  coins per match and a  day month that comes out to  matches per month or . matches per day or . matches per hour every single hour of every single day for the past month. Seeing as how a match takes  minutes due to setting up loading cutscreens etc. it is literally impossible to play  minutes worth of FIFA in  minutes.And then these people have a top rated squad of like . Its an obvious bot but they remain at top of the leaderboards. Just like anything if you cut off the supply youll have a much larger success rate but my opinion is that FIFA does not care about coin sellers because they drive up the price of players so people then rationalize that they have to buy packs because its the only way to get Ronaldo or Messi.,FIFA,cnwfpwi,5,t5_2qxh7

2946556,0,t1_co2zj5g,Having done recordings with my silver team and having to look at a lot of game stuff you can notice the AI making stupid mistakes its just that forever reason someone missed the chance. I had Chris Klute at LB and I could see him being to narrow or too high or just ball watching much more then my gold players. Rather then exploiting his positioning people would try to square up and run by him and at   pace and good strength that plays right into his hands . I bet that guy thinks everything was going in my favor but in truth he was just matching his weaker winger against a physical back.Silver teams are often heavy on pace  strength and agility which can overcome a lot in this game and when you have a whole team built around one or two strengths it can be harder especially if yours isnt built as direct counter. Rudiger and Diekmeyer together can lock down a whole side of the field and the only way to beat them is with heavy and patient possession. Its not that the silver is being favored its that EA have failed to make defensive stats as noticeable as a pacestrength. On offensive any player can finesse near post regardless of finishing so when you look at there isnt a huge difference in talent when looking at single game sample.  ,FIFA,co31cqp,5,t5_2qxh7

Pretty much constant stuttering. Absolutely fucking insufferable.gtSo what happens if there happens to be a problem albeit it temporary in your area which affects your connection? Youd be whinging if there was a blanket ban then I suspect..If there was a problem that affected my internet connection I wouldnt want to play online. Simple as that. I dont understand how anyone can enjoy playing with some of the lag they have. I would be completely okay with swallowing my own medicine in this situation.gt So heres a thought if its such an issue why dont you play off Line? People dont have unstable connections on purpose.I understand they dont want to have a bad internet connection but why should I have to play against the AI if I want to avoid wasting  minutes of my life? Why shouldnt they play against the AI? If someone knows theyre lagging badly they should have some decency and not waste everyones time.After typing this out I think either a blanket ban or more fairly an actual ping indicator would be the best solution.

The workrates are balanced you have the  best full backs in the game  of the best cheap centrebacks in the game quick wingers and can cut in and shoot a strong balanced midfield and Aguero who is just a monster this year.Personally my style of gameplay with this squad is quick passing and possession if the midfield is ever under pressure they have enough strength to fend of their opponents the wide players have enough pace to find that little bit of clear space and once you get used to it its unstoppable. EDIT Also if its any more help here are my instructions LBRB to Stay Back while Attacking All midfield on Free Roam Matic to Stay Back Jovetic to Stay Forward Wingers Get in Behind and Cut in and Aguero to Get in Behind and Press Backline.,FIFA,cogyrch,2,t5_2qxh7

If they just did away with it it would suck and there would be tons of cheese if you could throw a  pace winger at every position without repercussion for example. Nobody wants to see totally fake unrealistic teams atleast chemistry keeps us somewhat grounded.My suggestion was to use the career mode preferred positions list. Abolish specific position change cards. Instead of having Position Change LWLF wed have Position change for Left Wingers  after you applied this card to your LW he would be switched to the next position in his preferred positions list. Some players have more preferred positions than others but the career mode database for this is unique and from what Ive seen  relatively accurate. Its also already in the game so any work to accomplish this would be minimal I think. ,FIFA,corlac7,19,t5_2qxh7

3180836,0,t1_coricfx,Im a lawyer but I dont claim to know everything about IP law Im not a litigator or IP attorney and Ive said in the past that I dont believe its economically feasible for EA to go after all of these coin sellers.  Although I have nothing substantial to back this up I believe they are relatively small time operators in foreign countries that dont have particularly friendly legal systems.  I think the costs outweigh the benefits of litigating collecting or enforcing judgments.That said I think the counterclaim by Blizzard in the MDY case has some merit in cases against coin sellers.  Particularly the tortious interference with contracts EULA the contributory copyright infringement and vicarious copyright infringement claims.  All EA would have to do is prove that coin sellers are buying from coin glitchingfarmer using third party software bots.

The problem is that you have to find a way to keep possession and still be a danger for your opponents goal.You have to learn when to play calm and when to play fast.Use the whole pitch. It opens up space a lot. Keep the ball rotating and play diagonally to switch sites. It will give you space and more options.But keep in mind dont only play on possession switch your playstyle if you find yourself lost in possession. It will surprise your opponents.One touch back and furth passing will open up a lot of space on the wings. Learn to use it effectivly.Also learn basic skills and to hold RT  LT in dribbling situations. It will help you keep possession and open up new passing ways.Use players in midfield that are good in passingoverview and holding the ball.,FIFA,cox4wi2,1,t5_2qxh7

They do not have the disposable income to currently buy FP. Therefore they result to the next best option to get their favourite players Coins. I dont like buying coins. I dont like breaking the TOS. But because of the price difference in what you get coins is the only viable option for many people.And not to mention how much they are currently making alone from FP sales. I know this is a huge argument of why they shouldnt bring the price down because its making them so much money. But they could potentially make more by lowering the price. The lower the price the more often people will buy them. If something is  youre not realistically going to buy it every week given that youre in the age bracket above. Whereas is something is say  you can probably afford that every week.TLDR FP prices are too high for many to afford.,FIFA,coy935z,1,t5_2qxh7

You are only allowed to buy from one place now and to earn from one place. Coin sellers did nothing to harm the game just were competition for EA. Person lists a card for X amount nothing wrong with that Person buys said card for X amount Nothing wrong with that end of story. Because someone decided to pay for the coins its suddenly wrong? What if i didnt pay for the coins? What i do with my money is of no concern to EA. The coins i paid for are not fake or made up. They are all part of the game. EA constantly gives out coins and players to people for free. My friend has called many times to EA saying his account was hacked and his players were sold off or he bought a player for X amount of coins and the coins have been taking away but the player never came and they just gave him shit. If EA wanted to sell coins coin sellers would lose the majority of their business and that would be the right thing to do. Competition is good for the consumer. Now EA can charge  for  fifa points if they want because people dont have an alternative. Banning someone for buying currency real or not just shows how greedy EA is. Instead of making a product that is better they are worried about people buying FIFA points. Fix the game play fix the DNF issue fix the players being stuck in trading piles fix the AI. Dont worry about how i spend my money that i earned. This update only changed two things. Coin buying and EAs profit margin.,FIFA,cpabsq5,1,t5_2qxh7

You might seriously want to invest in a new controller but I understand that sometimes Coutinho might be in a position to get the ball from Costa and Costa cant pull all the way around Coutinho to get the ball every time. I just think especially in some of the cases youve mentioned people expect the world from their players and if  they do the job i.e. Costa plowing or Walcott pacing theyll concentrate on the  time and thatll stick in their memory. ,FIFA,cq5bwox,1,t5_2qxh7

3632440,0,t1_cq62gj9,The real fix was setting a max of  matches per game. But that still allows them to get ish coins per account per day not even counting division winnings.  When you have hundreds of accounts its not hard to farm coins still.If you think that fixing people modifying their consoles to glitch the game is an easy fix for EA your an idiot.Look at how many people can go years with modified Xbox s on XBLive and never get caught by Microsoft...i was one of them.  Microsoft was literally losing millions of dollars a year to people downloading  games instead of buying them and they couldnt come up with a reliable fix that wasnt circumvented by the modchip firmware guys within a month.The next big real fix that EA could possibly do IMO to fix the game in addition to  games per day is to issue game keys with each copy of  FIFA to activate FUT.  One copy of Fifa   FUT account.  Its how most online games on consoles and PC work.The fact that on consoles you can make unlimited numbers of FUT accounts with one FIFA disc by simply making a new PSNXBLive account is stupid as shit and of course people are going to automate making accounts and mass flood the market with bots.  If every one of their hundreds of accounts cost them  it would curb it by quite a bit i think because the cost of coins would be so incredibly high it would limit the number of people buying.  Right now the coin farmers actually outsource their account generation to other groups that make PSNXBLive accounts by the tens of thousands and sell them in very large chunks that they then feed into their autobuyers and scripts this is why you see so many accounts with gibberish names like dsdha like someone facerolled their keyboard.  Then again  who the hell knows because PC has this basicallyone Fifa game   origin account but it still seems to be rampant there more so than other places but i believe that is because you can more  easily automate on PC using simple Mouse and keyboard macros something that isnt possible on consoles short of building some sort of camera and robot to move the thumb sticks.  Most coins on Consoles i believe  come from Autobuyers and bots on the webapp as well as people glitching matchs for coinsfixed with  limit somewhat as i said.Does FUT right now require a PS account?  If not thats another step they could take to limit the number of accounts these farmers have access too.  The account creators will just skip over FIFA and go to a game with a higher profit margin like some  FP MMO if they have to spend  to create a PS account and then  for a  FUT account.  Without mass accounts at their disposal bannings will actually effect the coin farmers...as it is now one account gets banned and theres  that havent been banned...its just a casualty of war.If you goto the bot forums you can see even the small time coin farmers who sell to the larger coin seller companies have  accounts at their disposal...they hate losing accounts but its just part of the business.  I shudder to think of how many accounts the big boys have.,FIFA,cq6bqwv,8,t5_2qxh7

Modify the formations so that  CMs are back as CDM and have the last one as a CAM but only so that its barely on th edge of being recognized as a Cam. Default settings for Isco as a cam kroos and modric are set to stay back and the defense is default. At kick off go ultra attacking and work on moving the ball quickly.

3871185,0,t1_cqxhxt2,The problem is that the market is broken. Buying coins is like printing your own money in real life. As so many people do it prices rise and rise. Without the priceranges the rate of inflation was much much bigger than the deflation caused by packsEAtax hence the prices were rising like crazy and casual players and players that are not willing to invest loads of money werent able to afford the better players. The system has shown not to work without stricter regulations.Now that we have price ranges many people still think prices will rise significantly especially for the mediumpriced players Reus Di Maria Kompany Boateng etc. which will not be the case. The might change a bit but a huge increase to the upper price cap would render price ranges useless as it would be basically just a delayed inflation.So yes people who keep their cards because they dont want to lose to much money are stupid its not like waiting would improve anything.

3951078,0,t3_35pz73,General TipsThese are are a few tips in regards to attacking that may be usful I dont think crossing is very effective against the CPU. I would only recommend it in situations where youve got your front  running at just their back four and the cross becomes more about waiting for your striker or other winger to drop off their defender to find some space. Just straight up crossing into a crowded box will rarely work. Its honestly fairly easy to score goals straight from kick off. I have an example earlier where I score from kick off with Gotze that displays how simple it can be. You just walk at their nearby player sprint suddenly past him keep sprinting slightly outwards until you get between a CB and fullback then use a ronaldo chop or fake shot to turn inside of them and boom you can score for free. Free kicks should become fairly routine goals for you. The CPU often wont jump with its wall and you have to take advantage of this. Use a left footed player to take free kicks on the right side and inversely for the left aim just between the head of the nd and third man in the wall  bars of power whilst holding LB and youll probably score. If youre using more power then aim it closer to where you want it to go because these will curve less. This strategy will work at most ranged until you get really far out like  yards or so in which case you probably shouldnt be shooting unless you have TOTY Kroos praise be unto him. Here is a quick example of a routine free kick for me with Alonso  In terms of simple skills Stepovers are decent roulettes can be really effective with good timing BerbaMcgeady spin almost always beats the CPU players as does Ronaldo Chops fake shots in general can be used anywhere to beat people. I also often use that inside turn thats like a  roulette I have no idea what the name is but the controls for it are pushing the stick twice to the south eastwest in regards to your player. Hopefully that makes sense.Defending against the CPUAlright Ive talked about how I score against the CPU. So hows about defending against them? There isnt a playstyle per se when it comes to defending against them. Here Ill just be listing tips on how to do it so lets begin Fight the bastards all the way. I talked about this in my last post and I still think its really important. You cannot wait till theyre around your box making passes to tackle them. Thats when the CPU is most dangerous because once one of your players is out of position its suddenly in the back of your net. Furthermore you do not want them putting crosses into the box because theyre deadly. Use your CDMCMCAMLMRM to hunt the ball carrier as they push up the pitch. Involve your back four before they reach the box. I wouldnt recommend this for online play but Its vital against the AI. If the opponents striker has the ball and has no players ahead of him then run a CB to him to try and make a tackle. Same case for a fullback against a winger. NEVER do this if its a v on your defender. Fast fullbacks let you make more mistakes. Here is an example in which I screw up with Alba by bringing him too far out but then make up for the mistake with pure pace  Control your tacklers. Have you ever set the AI to play the AI and just watched? No one scores. The AI is a great defender. But not the silly dicks on your team. Try not to use second defender pressure whenever you can and just go on to one with CPU players with a player youre controlling. Dont oversprint when chasing the ball carrier. I struggled for a long time with holding the sprint button down too long when I reach an opponent and Id simply run by them as they changed direction and moved past me. Stop earlier and move in slowly. Their passes are bullshit. The AI almost always plays passes it knows it will make. To you it doesnt look possible but theyll do it anyway. Here is a few examples of what I mean   These show how theyll just pass it straight through your players because they know theyll overstep the ball. Youre much more likely to intercept their passes if you jockey instead. Just accept that when youre sprinting beside them they will pass through you. Fouls are somewhat biased for the CPU. Its a shit happens situation unfortunately. Often times the AI will foul you but the ref wont call a god damn thing. This particularly happens in situations where the AI will only catch your players feet  However It can happen in more annoying situations where they take you out entirely such as here  As I say I cant give you any advice about this unfortunately other than to try to aim away from your TV when you throw your controller. The only thing I can say is that in terms of punishment the CPU is not at all biased as Ive seen a lot of straight reds for stuff they do. Its just actually calling the fouls thats a problem.MentalityThe last thing I want to very briefly discuss is your mentality. Try to ignore the bullshit that I so often see mentioned. Focus on how you can improve. What you did wrong in a situation. Hit pause and go into an instant replay to review what you did wrong. Did you get tackled by a brutally accurate tackle? Well did you show them too much of the ball? Maybe you just let them get too close? Did you run for too long alongside one of their players?Did they pass it through your defense making you feel helpless? Why did their ball carrier not have a player marking him? Did you pull a player out of position in a v situation?The list goes on Im just you get the gist. Honestly the only bullshit that exists on World Class in my opinion is the fouls and some of their passes through the legs of your players. Past that...youve just got to get better and you will. So Ignore the bullshit focus on what you did wrong try to improve and most importantly...just keep playing. If you just play game after game regardless of outcome or bullshit with a focus on beating them then youre going to start getting better and better results until youre like me and you  World Class for a relaxing evening. Thats it!Having written this I feel as though I shouldve just made this into a set of installments or something because its just a horrific wall of text and I dont even think I can get down half of the stuff Id like to say. Nonetheless I really hope it can be of some use in dealing with the World Class difficulty jump. Obviously after reading this you wont suddenly be able to dominate World Class its going to take a lot of practice but I think these are great methods to begin with.If youve got any questions then just pop them in the comments and Ill try and respond. Criticisms are also welcome!TLDR I think possession football isnt a great way to beat the CPU on World Class for people who are struggling because it puts the game in the CPUs hands. A dribbling style just relies on you entirely give it a go.,FIFA,cr6nnjt,5,t5_2qxh7

The game relies too much on pace to be realistic. The glitches in the servers giving winners the loss is annoying plus a DNF modifier are annoying to say the least. I couldnt access my ultimate team for  weeks so I got  free tradeable packs as a sorry.  It took me  hours a day for  straight weeks in order to find an American rep that could help me.It took EA  months to give me my  players that got lost in the transfer market back. By then their value was . I have not spent any money on the game after TOTY came out because everyone was cheating to get all the top players for cheap. Even if they didnt buy coins  they can make a near unbeatable squad for k on xbox Serie A that can run around the AI and or body feint glitch in the box for a free penalty kick. Yes this is a real glitch works  of the time and when people play like assholes and park the bus  minutes into the game after a Doumbia goal I use it to out cheese them. I always say this game is a piece of shit  but its the best piece of shit we have to play. I am voting with my wallet again and maybe in  years the game will be to my liking. Oh well.

They are never ever going to be able to stop coin selling completely however if they make it so you actually have to earn your coins rather than glitch them there will be far less of an impact on the market.

4124365,0,t3_37w47z,I use ultra defensive right before I go to make a major attack the people I need will be in position and the rest will be more prepared to get back if you lose possession. Likewise ill go back to balanced once my team teacks back and my opponent is trying to make their push because if you stay in UD I find the bots arent aggressive enough.   Other advice would be dont switch to the defender guarding the ball carrier every time. Use the right thumbstick to switch to off ball defenders and help adjust them when need be. Dont use the rb button for pressure except occasional scenarios for just a couple seconds.  Dont try to dribble around everyone dont be afraid of passing back to move forward.  Keep your defence lined up dont switch on a lobbed through ball until you want the tackle made just remember you have to play and defend with a totally different mentality and if you get frustrated thatll subconsciously change without you noticing,FIFA,crqei5n,1,t5_2qxh7

We will monitor the prices and continually update them they said.Instead like so many other false promises from EA they have let their focus wane from the Price Range Project which is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE given that they have assumed absolute rule over prices.To be quite frank what happened over the weekend is fucking ridiculous. This was TOTS BPL weekend the most popular league on FUT. There was a second TOTS team available a full TOTW available. There could not have been a more important weekend in the FUT world. Yet largelyignored prices remained at a point where  of cards will not sell. If we take a clearheaded look back at this we can see what an absolute farce this was. ,FIFA,crrvy2a,19,t5_2qxh7

4331826,0,t1_csdwlrf,Well I mean if you dont count the massive  passing and   dribbling there isnt Surely  ball control wont matter because its a CB right? You literally only use them for heading the ball away or sliding tackles and then smashing the ball to wherever.Sarcasm aside Chiellini and Barzagli for that matter have such terrible ball control and passing skills that they often win balls back with their impressive defensive stats and immediately give it away again due to a horrible first touch or a pass so bad its pretty much an assist to the opponent.I gave up on bad ball control defenders as soon as I realized that  of the goals I was conceding were due to the CBs not being able to control the ball half decently.,FIFA,csdxclp,1,t5_2qxh7

Edit Let me say that I really like TOTS Bellarabi just not sure if  coins makes him that much better than alternatives.  I do really enjoy playing with him.  If coins are no object for you then try him out.TOTS Verhaegh is nothing special.  Edit  Has a tendency to pull way central for me and doesnt get forward very much but hes solid.  Hes about as good as any BuLi right back in the high s  low s.TOTS Junuzovic is good but I m not quite getting his shots on target.

4685753,0,t3_3f31sh,This has been posited many times before. Some version of buying said player from EA for a price greater than the market value. There are problems with this. First off this would create even more extinction because those who have the coins would have no reason to open a shit load of packs hunting for a player when they could just buy one at any time. Less packs being opened equals less on the market to be bought and sold. Second this would further provide reasons to buy coins. We all hope the glitches are fixed but coin buying will still be possible in my opinion perhaps harder but still around. So instead of buying coins to buy packs or players on the market the coins are now spent on players who are not able to be traded. Yes this may help fight inflation but again packs are not opened and coins are not moving freely within the market so less of said player is on the market. Knowing that a player is x the market price those who have the coins to hoard would have an even easier time manipulating prices because there will be fewer on the market at a lower price available for those who do not buy coins. So said coin buyer and or hoarder now has an even smaller amount of players they need to buy from the market to force a price range update that raises the price leading to a greater incentive to hoard and price fix. ,FIFA,ctl6ncu,1,t5_2qxh7

The only reason they say EA doesnt care about the PC is because PC is the only place you can cheat. If it was possible to do it on the consoles it wouldnt be fixed there either.

4730717,0,t1_ctqtclb,You can usually flip low end Gold NIF under  for  coin profit but the higher you go the harder it is to make coins and you get less return for money.  I made most of my coins recently from NIF investing on Futties player and MLS TOTS players and made about a million coins in  weeks.  IMO tournament investing is the way to go for next FIFA. If you have any leads on any upcoming tournament you should start investing on players from that countryleague like  weeks in advance.  For example Martins Kaka Pirlo Gerrad was going for less than  coins during Futties but he could be easily be sold for  coins few days before MLS TOTS were out.  Dempsey Bradley and other American gold NIFs were basically going for discard price and went up to around  coins too.Contract trading also works if you buy them during peak hours during FuttiesTOTS or other big IF weeks.

5049835,0,t3_3k3n85,I think its really fun taking fallen giants and turning them around.For example A.C. Milan Parma if they are put in the rest of world league you can put them at the lowest playable Italian league PortsmouthAnd my favorite one to do....RANGERS because you can swap them into league  in England and work your way up all the way to premier league glory.  Also not to unrealistic as it sounds seeing that both Celtic and rangers considered switching to the FA in the past and I suspect will happen again in the futureAlso another fun idea is to start a player manager with an old legend Gerard Pirlo Lampard kaka etc. then when you start your career controlling that player you immediately retire and then you have the option to coach thus starting at lower level team job offers and working on a resume to get offers from top clubs.Kind of working on that last point you can also start a player career then when you retire with your player you have created you can go on to manage teams that offer you contracts and work your way up the managing ladder by doing good with lower sides to get offers from top sides similar to what you just did as a player career. ,FIFA,cuup2uj,4,t5_2qxh7

5061100,0,t1_cuvlhx7,gt Pace The time of the trigger happy sprinting bastards of the game is over. Players do feel a bit heavy while sprinting but speedy players are no longer a must have in the squad. You can no longer sprint pastthrough the last line of defense with complete ease not even with Bale or Ronaldo. If youre dead set on being a ball hog youll need to use the no touch dribbling mechanic to try to throw defenders off or try to play the ball in front using the RS. Im a fan of this update. Maybe Ill actually get to play a real game of football playing online now instead of losing to everyone just constantly sprinting through my defense.gt It was like that in last years demo as well if I remember correctly.

5301951,0,t1_cvpdjke,Human  I try to set my custom tactics to press and be as aggressive as you can handle it. Force the other player to make mistakes. Easy enough. Other people touched on it if your inside the box finesse shot is the way to go especially with the dominate foot. Long shots I usually try to curl in. AI  I always start attacking wide unless I can get a ATB and a clean breakaway. Once wide cut inside and sprint in towards goal. A lot of the time this forces the AI to try and slide sometimes resulting in a free kick or penalty. When you center the ball ALWAYS use R  X RB  A on xbox i beleive otherwise the pass will suck. The AI is really good at blocking shots at least on Legendary and you usually have to get in pretty close unless you can catch them on their heels which is rare. Long shots can work and I usually try and put spin on the ball. FIFA  is requires a lot more aiming I find than the previous versions.,FIFA,cvpdwh5,1,t5_2qxh7

5381831,0,t3_3onpvi,What baffles me is the fact that even with a year and arguably millions of  revenue from FUT points the developers managed to make a game that is simply not superior to its predecessor. A different game yes but different doesnt necessarily mean better. Hangover II and III were definitely not as good as the original Hangover and understandably so. The overall idea just wasnt the same even though the money kept coming in. With FIFA  they didnt have to come up with a new idea. They just had to work on the imperfections of the previous game and make some aesthetic changes. I just cant wrap my head around the fact that instead of merely improving what they already had they changed the gameplay for no reason as if the game was developed by an entirely new company. I always complain when a new FIFA comes out because I suck at it at first but then around January I forget about it and get good at the game. I know Ill get used to this game and start winning more and Ill probably complain when FIFA  comes out but that doesnt necessarily make the game anymore enjoyable. ,FIFA,cvzl8kf,1,t5_2qxh7

You cant just be annoying to gamers because you made an OP feature. Abuse how? Using the correct players and spending time on your tactics? You should be rewarded for that its not really abusing to be honest. Also set pieces arent a guarantee in this years FIFA we all know that. You must admit that there are versatile players out there. Players should just be able to have multiple positions and you can modify their position according to their preferred positions. For example Kuyt Dutch Winger originally can play RB RM RW.

5461584,0,t1_cw9olou,Just to play devils advocate... one  ball rolling to an opponent is not scripting or momentum or whatever. But when it happens  times a game possibly even for each player there is at the very least something wrong in the ball physics engine even if it has nothing to do with a script the computer is following. I am of the opinion that most events that are referred to as scripting is really just poorly written code as to how the physics of the game interact with the infinite number of possible out comes through out a game. And to be honest I completely understand how hard it would be to get it perfect but they could at least try and lessen it every year. As it stands the game feels the same the past two years in how these physics errors affect games. ,FIFA,cw9rp89,1,t5_2qxh7

When clearly he was being pulled earlier why not dive before?

Try to play as much possession as possible and always use the wings to overlap. If that draws players then go straight up the middle to Morata or Giovinco. If Morata is in sub him out for Giovinco fresh legs. Keep  sub ready so then when i am fouled sub Pirlo in for Insigne. Have Pirlo take the free kick and shoot  its a goal. ,FIFA,cwqphkf,1,t5_2qxh7

5606392,0,t3_3rubzs,Most of these guys come in with a beast midfielder pace wingers a quickphysical striker or  and a fast backline. Thell press high up and just flog long balls to the wings or target man once in possession  usually in  and  formations Ive found. Most games end up with them having  pass completion under  possession but scoring mostly shite goals  either targetman header to CAM or winger to score after the ball pings around the box  times or just cutting in sprint shoot. Im yet so see any beautiful goals scored against me with a nice flowing build up and intricate passing to make openings and score. Funny how the beautiful game was a massive part of their advertising campaign when all you see is hoofball and goals with only  passesplayers involved to score.Ive come to actually enjoy playing against it though.. WHen I see a high presshigh aggression tactic Ill press mine up a little to counteract it in tacticsinstructions and have a shortpassing but medfast buildup play. When building my team I always make sure my front  and mid  have at least  passing and  star weak foot. Also ensure my back line all have at around  average passing stats.This quick passing and interplay needed to beat high pressure took a while to get a hang of but once you get your first touches close dribblingskills when pressed hard to move the ball out to a team mate and driven passes on point you can play a pretty nice passing game with dinks and backheels into free space behind an opponent. My passing was dreadful a few weeks back   now managing  most games and funnily enough started to win a lot more.If theyre sprinting at you full pace a slight shimmy or skill away fron their sprinting direction and a driven pass from there is all it takes really. Even doing that and having to pass backwards will open up so many options behind em.,FIFA,cws0zg8,2,t5_2qxh7

5711609,0,t3_3tckw8,Prices depends of  major factors  rarity demand VS supply psychological price  I love Griezman IRL i would give a kidney to own his card in FIFA  or I think prices are going down let sell my players quicklyWhen market is stable ie offer meets demand price are stable. When demand is higher prices go up because every one is buying so low price goes first etc.When supply is higher it is the other way around. People want to sell and have to lower the price to cut under the market price.When blackfriday happends it is called a supply crisis.  things may happen   First because of massive discounts on packs people open packs and flood the market. So rarity of player lowers and price start to fall. Because of a psychological factor everybody announces market crash and try to panic sell thus CREATING the market crash by announcing it  its called a self fullfilling prophecy in economics the crash is created by the supply crisis AND the psychological crisis. It is quite the same for every big economic crisis where wall street people start to panic and major finance market crashes. Creating a deflation spirale. Smart people who knows crash are coming sell just before the crisis and buy again when prices are low. It is call an insider trading when you know before everyone some crucial information to earn massive profit for exemple when you sell your shares of a X company  days before they announce a bankrupt.,FIFA,cx52x4a,7,t5_2qxh7

Sure the gameplay mechanics for v play is probably the most significant and clear cut aspect that EA needs to work on but you cant say that customisation does not hold the mode back.

Matchmaking doesnt even match you to someone else in your same division exclusively anyway. I am just not seeing how that would be terrible. What does your opponents team have anything to do with anything.

Use your CDMs for the defending. Even if they are behind the attacking striker who has the ball. Just move them back while the attacker moves towards your CBs. If you try this youre defence will improve a lot! I won straight divisions until div. I got stomped every match with a  loss as an alltime low. I relegated and started focussing on getting my CDMs back. If this isnt possible I just used my fullbacks.

Absolute train.Dribbling Neymars NIF will always beat any future cards of Kono in this department simply because he has an authentic way of moving around. His  star skills make add up to his unpredictability. Not saying Kono is bad at it hes just not quite on that Neymar levelShooting Neymar is one of the best goalscoring wingers youre gonna get IG. Although he doesnt generate the power of the likes of RobbenBaleRonaldoReus he somehow manages to get the ball in the back of the net. Konos shooting is good enough but nothing too special.Passing Kono is more of a team player and catalyst. His passing and crossing are brilliant and he is great at setting up others. Neymar is a bit behind in terms of playmaking.Physical Both players can run the entire game however Kono wins this one because of his great strength. You can go shoulder to shoulder with any fullback i went up against Abate and Kono was schooling him and get out on top while that kind of situation would result in Neymar losing possession. Overall i found SIF Kono to be a fantastic card and great substitute to more expensive options. His direct pace and speed dribbling is always an asset for any side. However Neymar has that extra flair that sets him apart from the crowd.,FIFA,cy63app,3,t5_2qxh7

6004962,0,t3_3xofno,Excellent tips! How far did you managed to get with manual controls? I played solely manual last year and managed to get to DIV once.This year I find it too hard especially when I can find the time for only a few matches a week so not much time to master it so I changed to assisted passing with manual through balls. Its nice to be able to get away from pressing with assisted passing and find this perfect passing line with a through pass.So if anyone wants to try manual I really recommend to start with this.Anyway manual controls taught me to keep patient and basically everything you covered in your first two points.

6120893,0,t3_3zbtg8,Scripting is absolutely not a fundamental of game designs...Ive said it a hundred times but ill say it once more for people that are still trying to convince each other that the game is scripted for you to winloseconcede in certain circumstances.Scripting and handicaps are not a thing in Fifa. What is present though is poor coding. At least the algorithms they write that decides what happens when are skewed. Every time you carry out an action ingame the game runs an algorithm to decide what happens. Each outcome has a chance so its essentially like spinning a roulette wheel and seeing what it lands on however some outcomes have more slots and therefore are more likely to happen. The stats of your player determine how many slots each outcome has and what chances there are. The problem is it doesnt seem to be consistent. For example each time you shoot there are a couple of outcomes. On target and offtarget. Then the keepers algorithms run save and catch save and parry dive and miss. Obviously the choices are a lot more complicated than just that but thats the gist of it. Like i said its a bit skewed so regardless of the fact that each thing should have its own chance of happening it seems like some outcomes occur a lot more often than others.Aside from that theres also the fact that when were losing or not scoring we notice the negatives more than we do when were winning.  up you dont think about missing another  shots but drawing  or  down you notice it and get more annoyed by it.Scripting does not exist its just poor coding and your perception of the game that makes it seem so.EDIT Let me just add one thing thanks to a couple of comments below. We all know of players like AHugeGorilla and HekticJukez. If scripting and handicaps were a thing there is  chance that those two and the rest that are insanely good at the game would have such outstanding records. If there was scripting not a soul could play  games and come away with over  wins and less than  losses. It would not happen. That alone is the counterargument to everybody that believes in scripting. ,FIFA,cyldrki,11,t5_2qxh7

6226091,0,t1_cyx6pvw,gtAnd if you think that finishing has no effect on their ability to score long shots youre wrong. The very definition of finishing from EA is their ability to score strictly inside the box. The very definition of long shots from EA is their ability to score strictly outside the box. Why else would they have  separate card stats if either one of them overlapped with the other ones ability even in the slightest? Thats like saying having a bad long passing stat will affect their ability to take decent corners or free kicks in general. Theyre similar in a sense that long passing and FK accuracy are both considered when calculating the base PAS stat sure. But in no way does one affect the other positively or negatively. Think about it it just doesnt make sense for them to. ampnbspEDIT Also for the future its easy to predict what an IFSIFTOTYTOTS etc. cards ingame stats will be if only their cards base stats are available such as when the TOTW has been announced but not yet released in packs therefore their base stats are visible but ingame stats are not yet available on FUThead or FUTbin. You do it based on the ingame stats of their most recent card. The general rule is that for every point increase in a base stat besides pace the ingame Mental stat that corresponds to the base stat is also increased by the same amount with the remainder of corresponding stats increasing by a maximum of that amount. These are Positioning for SHO Vision for PAS Reactions for DRI Interceptions for DEF and Aggression for PHY. For example Pogbas base SHO stat increased by  therefore his Positioning increased by . All of the other ingame stats within SHO increased by a maximum of . In fact all of them did besides Finishing which was increased by . This rule applies for every card and every stat and can be pretty useful if you dont have access to the card and if the various FUTrelated sites arent working. Cheers!,FIFA,cyxc7ih,2,t5_2qxh7

6302883,0,t3_41xst5,My best tip is to play while calm. Listen to music if you have to. Recently made it to division  offline by playing slow and patient. If you feel yourself getting frustrated go do something else until you calm down. As for tips on scoring longshots work really well against World Class and Legendary. Running down the wing and cutting inside with fake shot or McGeady spin also works wonders. Never be afraid to take the shot. Never think that you have to be directly in front of the goal to score. The odd goal does happen once in a while. To defend against the AI you want to contain them with your Midfield if they get past them contain with your fullbacks and if they get past that contain with your center backs. Your CBs and Goalkeeper should always be your last line of defense. The best way to gain possession from the AI is to cut off their passing lanes. You want to constantly pressure them and not allow them any space to get in your box. The AI on World Class and Legendary wont pass into the box unless they have the space to so try to contain them outside by constantly switching players outside the box when they are passing around to look for space. The AI suck at defending counter attacks so make sure you can finish with your strikers and wingers. Whether it be a sweat goal to beat the keeper or a finesse shot make sure you capitalize on the Counters. Try not to concede first as the AI usually switch formations to  once they go  up. If youre chasing the game the AI will stall near injury time so it is important to try and atleast equalize before then. Sorry for the wall of text but I just wanted to share some of my tips that I use when playing vs AI. I play a ton of single player so the AI is pretty predictable at this point. Just practice practice practice until you can comfortably beat each difficulty.,FIFA,cz62eyy,4,t5_2qxh7
6302914,0,t1_cz60uuh,I think instead anywhere there was a former green link there should be an orange link. This would be a way to nerf players like Ibra as hed only be able to play with players from Ajax Barca Milan etc instead of everyone in those leagues. I think it should also be where a player that formerly played for a team lets say Milan should be able to get an orange link with someone else who formerly played for that team meaning Kaka and Ibra would get an orange link.

Double tap the cross button instead of a regular cross. It works best if you have time to bring your MW to a complete stop but it is also effective on the run.

Which I would recommend at all times. Also Chiellini lacks a bit in the passing department. If you arent  on your passes you might end up with him passing straight to opponents striker and get you in trouble. I still use him though. Doesnt seem to be a problem.

Counter attacking is effective that is correct  but its not the only way to be effective. There are many ways to avoid being countered and there are many ways of stopping a counter. Its all a matter of your style and how good you are. And why does build up play have to be slow? It doesnt. Also who cares what the alledged best players play? Who are they anyway?  is only the popular preference by most people because at some point someone said it was the best because it fills up the midfield have good links and you can use Ronaldo and Bale as duo strikers. Any other formation is just as viable depending on your own ability and how you want to play.Just because you feel that one thing doesnt work doesnt mean it has to apply to everyone else and just because some of the youtubers tend to play a certain formation doesnt mean it has to be the best.

6671356,0,t3_4716ca,I actually used to thing the same thing but after a few thousand hours at this garbage fire I figured out a few things.  Now it feels to me like goalies have been nerfed.. Head Shot When you are about  strides from the goalie they cant react quickly to shots at their head.  I aim about  away from their weak footed ear and it is a guaranteed goal.  However any further out and their bicep tends to contact the ball and it will almost certainly carom out perfectly in stride to their streaking striker. Typical fifa . Far Post Finesse  Pretty well known that if you are in the corner of the  yard area with your strong foot away from goal a finesse into the upper corner has an incredibly high chance of scoring.  I am near  with this technique nowI just make sure that I aim  netting squares inside of the post and  from the top of the side netting. Try it.  Youll see.. Corner Kick Reverse Lead  Headers from corners are OP this year.  You just need to make sure that you dont drop the ball on the strikers head awkward control or in front weak shot.  I usually aim  ball width outside of my far post striker.  This gives him the ability to cock his head back for extra power.  Then hit it across goal to the reverse back corner of the netting.  When you get good at this you can put a reverse spin on it that makes it just die in the corner which looks awesome in replays.. Goalie long shots  These are SERIOUSLY OP this year.  If you have a goalie with a long shot over  you pretty much can count on winning a match.  Anything from the opponents side of the halfline in the center circle goes in.  Like .  Try it reversing to the far corner left of CC right top of goal.  Im about  there.  Of course the risk is in getting him out that far but believe me its worth it..  Dont think of your mother naked  Pretty much sums it up.  Sounds stupid but as soon as I stopped thinking of my mom naked when I shot the goals started raining in.  This was suggested byt NotaperVII on his stream.  Hat tip to him.Hope those suggestions help.  Good luck!,FIFA,d09djcz,5,t5_2qxh7

Was voted the Serie A player of the decade. Made the Real Madrids Team of the Century. Inducted into Brazils Italys and Real Madrids Halls of Fame. There is no requirement to play x amount of seasons to be considered a legend. Ronaldo is universally considered a legend because his peak at such a young age was dumbfounding. No matter how you look at it Ronaldo was and still remains a legend and is widely considered to be one of the greatest players of all time. The fact his career was cut off at various points due to injury doesnt make him any less a legend. van Basten retired at  due to injury and everyone also rightfully considers van Basten a legend. ,FIFA,d09f9t2,1,t5_2qxh7

Jukez and many other top players has a winrate of you usually cant draw in other games so take that into account.

Of course Douglas Costa  Coman were great trades given that the NIF cards werent cheap but cards like Kane isnt too attractive imo,FIFA,d1hj3gv,1,t5_2qxh7

That destroys the market on those days. Yes the trend of less ROI can be blamed on TOTS but I honestly believe it was exacerbated by his posts. Not only does he discuss the methods but he tells you exactly who to buy when to buy them when to sell them etc. There usually arent weektoweek updates on this information and that is why I think his posts have led to a lower ROI.,FIFA,d1tjxbv,1,t5_2qxh7

7290051,0,t1_d26o228,It seems like most people I play run into a similar problem when playing as him. Hes not quick and people tend to get the ball to him too quickly near the middle Of the pitch. Hes too slow to cover a lot of ground and beat defenders that way but he is unbelievably nimble in tight spaces.Hes the definition of a target striker. If you can learn how to use his body to protect the ball he is amazingly OP. He is unstoppable when you use the burba spin to find space. Or next time you use him hold LTL while standing still after he receives the ball. Hell put his back to the defender to shield the ball. Then do a simple skill move to get him open in space. Shoot. Score every time. Repeat. IMO ibra is the best striker in the game when used effectively.Just my two cents.

7297027,0,t1_d27ki12,Agreed. A better option wouldve been to force flairs and have a wider variety of them. If you dont want to see those posts dont click them. Simple as that. If you go to the effort of clicking a post you know isnt going to contain content you like and then bitch about the post youre the dumbass. Also what the fuck is the point of a weekly rant thread if it only is stickied for one day yet all other posts related to it that are made within the next week are sent there? And also Player vs Player or IF v IF or Is x player any good type posts shouldnt be redirected to the squad help post. Thats for squads not people asking for mini reviews on players.I feel like if this game wasnt so buggy we wouldnt have the issue of those posts in the first place. If a government is corrupt drowning peoples complaints out isnt going to solve anything. People need to be able to voice their opinion and from what Ive heard on the EA forums they dont allow that sort of stuff for a reason.There was even that guy on the Neymar samba skill video that tried to claim the guy was wiggling the stick. Seriously what the fuck people. There are finally posts that arent rants or player related questions but you then go on and bitch about it. Get over it. You got the content you asked for what else do you want?gt  The classic I had  shots and  goals the other guy had  shot and  goals picture.I agree with this but you need to sort the rant thread out. Have one stickied every day like the daily squad one and youll start to see that people will post their stuff there.gt  I just lost a game when was the top secret patch that caused this released?The fact is at certain points during the game a decent amount of people have felt like there were changes that had happened in the previous  hours. Again its rant thread material fix that and then delete posts that are on that subject but not in the rant thread. Easy.gt  Why is there such a huge difference between FUT and HH? FUT feels slow and non responsive HH feels like smooth and awesomeI agree but I rarely see these sort of posts. Maybe once or twice a week.

For me Zabaleta an Bellerin perform about the same for me maybe leaning toward Zabaleta and Im an Arsenal fan. Dont neglect defense on your CMs. Keep a well balanced midfield. Know what your playstyle is and build around it. You should build around your playstyle not the players. Pretend you are a coach. You have a certain play style formation and system.

7360672,0,t3_4g62cm,The only legend Ive used is Keane and if you are looking for someone to be the physical presence in the middle of the field I cant suggest him enough.Pros I cannot overstate how physically imposing he feels. Every single time I went for a tackle with him I thought I would win it and almost always I did. Just an amazing defensive presence in the midfield.  His shooting stat on his card looks worse than he played for me. He shouldnt be your main scoring option but he can do a solid job if given space or a solid shooting chance.   As a more defensive minded player I didnt use him as the guy making killer passes so his short passing is more than enough. Keep it simple.Cons  skills and  weak foot may be an issue for some. I normally like all of my midsattacking players to be at least  skill but with guys like Keane I can work around it but others may not.  With his relative lack of pace he wont be able to track back if you get him caught too far up field but this is just me nitpicking because I dont have too much negative to say about him.Rating  . If he had  skills I would have given him a  most likely. I paid K for him when I got him but according to FUThead his lowest BIN right now is K which is still a high price for one player but if you have the coins to buy him and want an absolute anchor of a midfielder hes the guy. ,FIFA,d2euw9e,3,t5_2qxh7

Doesnt invalidate thousands upon thousands of instances of clear failures of the mechanics that people experience all the god damn time.Every time you argue this point you say something like If you constantly blame the game for everything that goes wrong why? Who is blaming the game for literally everything that goes wrong? You frequently ignore the people pointing out specific instances of inconsistent gameplay and act as if they simply dont know how to play and blame the game for everything its bullshit. You arent special or uniquely talented we arent incompetent. Its incredibly grating to read your condescending comments about how we all suck and dont understand how the game works. Its needlessly patronising and dismissive.Not everything has to be extreme. You dont have to either blame the game for everything or blame yourself for everything. Yes there are many situations where its down to you and of course there will be times where it seems like bullshit but is actually your fault due to the complexity of the game but that doesnt mean there arent times where the game totally fails mechanically or otherwise and the gameplay suffers for it.

Among the  matches the losing side didnt manage to score in  cases. Hence we can conclude that the player who scored first certainly didnt lose in    matches i.e. . . On top of that are of course there are a lot of matches where the losing side did manage to score even though the winning side scored first. I have no hard facts for that part but I would like to make an assumption. If we assume that a player who won  had a  chance of scoring first the winning party would score first in    cases i.e.   of all matches that had a winner. ,FIFA,d32khfr,3,t5_2qxh7

I thought my best bet was to go in the same place so i held the right stick up and slightly to the right. My opponent inded went in the exact same place.

Filling it  bars before would do a normal pass and now it just does a little dinky pass or dinky shot. I dont get calls ever my friend got tackled from behind in the penalty box him vs the goalie and no call was made but I ran into a player not hitting X or B but just ran into the player and got a card  a penalty kick.  luckily I stopped it.

The only upside of current gen imo is that it feels a little bit more smoother but when Im playing on old gen I dont care about that.Before you say you cant say all those things because you dont play on current gen I can say them. Ive played over  games on current gen both XboxOne and PS. So I think Im more allowed to say such things about the differences in gameplay than almost all people on this sub because I think not a lot of people have played more on both generations than me.,FIFA,d48hffw,0,t5_2qxh7

A few contributing factors Womens team continues to be the best in the world while the mens team continues to improve. Hispanic population continues to grow in the US. MLS is growing at a decent clip which means that more fans have a local team to follow now. Its far easier to follow international soccer now than ever before.

8191062,0,t3_4riizq,Yeah ill echo what other people have said in that it seems as if youre too focused on attacking and moving forward immediately. Didnt see much hold up play or use of blocking in your defense either. Id say just try and slow your play down a bit focus on getting ideal first touches. Try and move their players around a bit and create spaces yourself rather than just looking for the player making the perfect run. On defense you probably need to jockey more and ingrain the idea of slowing down movements instead of going straight for the heavy tackles. Simply tracking back in front of the attacker and allowing your midfield and defense to get back with you can be a gamechanger I find it can make opponents basically tackle themselves running into a player tracking back with me.,FIFA,d51fn4t,2,t5_2qxh7

It clearly seems like EA doesnt feel like they did anything wrong they have no reason to make sure their dlc content performs as advertised only that it looks flashy and there is a demand for it different colored cards.  It wouldnt be a big deal if they didnt charge for draft drop rates were higher and prices for packs were generally cheaper as in MUT and HUT.  Despite these issues that continue to get worse we the community still buy points and play the game.  In a way a lot of these issues are on us.

8253169,0,t3_4sg121,Good read.Heres some info a couple years old that might be important but also might be irrelevant due to the growing nature of the esports scene outside of FIFA. The reason EA pass off the FIWC  Gfinity etc to companies outside of themselves is due to the fact they dont didnt? want to be involved in esports because of the bugs in the game. If they are hosting their own cup as pointed out in this thread it would be on them to provide any and all information on how the game works to make it a fair game. In LoL  team doesnt know more because they accidentally figured out a step over  chemistry bug. The team that knows more in LoL knows more because they learned and earned the knowledge and ability.FIFA most definitely needs this. Its something Ive asked for for years. Full transparency. I once asked Marcel Kuhn why they dont reveal all with chemistry and he basically said that the dev team like to give users the mystery they feel the game would lose a part of itself if everyone know everything and that was tolerable for  years ago but not today.I would love a comp scene a better pub scene more transparency and absolute power over why and what my team does what it actually does rather than guess work and half truths.The sad part is I cant see it coming in the near future.,FIFA,d597a5q,1,t5_2qxh7

Overall he was a very unpredictable opponent.Second relegation was against someone who had both Reus and Aubameyang futties in his team. It was a close game but overall he played a bit better than me so it was a deserved loss. This opponent played a fast counterattacking style. He was rather predictable but good at utilizing the different strengths of Reus and Aubameyang.Tournaments have been good this year.

Half time .Romania somehow managed to grab a goal out of nowhere with only their second shot of the night through Hoban in the rd minute. .Substitute Quaresma netted the winning goal for Portugal just moments after coming on in the th minute.Overall a very lackluster match with very little drama.

You talk about slow build up and a passing game as if that style is superior to every other way of playing. The current champions of England used a counter attacking system for majority of games last season. Youre simply whining that your system doesnt work against a certain style of play which is such a stupid thing to say since a lot of players adapt to the way their opponent plays and it seems that is something you do not know how to do. How do you think a good opponent will play when he sees youre a possession hungry player?Stop being ignorant and whining about players not letting you play the way you want play. You either refine and improve your game and system into such where your passes are not easily predictable and interceptable or mix it up and respond to how your opponent plays.,FIFA,d6gdtha,33,t5_2qxh7

Keep your current difficulty level and go into settings and drop your opponents acceleration passing and touch control stats by just  points. Play a game and you will notice you have a little more space and players with  passing stats wont look like Pirlo passing the ball around. You might have to repeat a couple times to fine what you think is still challenging but fun but tinkering with these stats helps make the difficulty more nuanced in the game.,FIFA,d8408hj,1,t5_2qxh7

Maybe with more OP ones since people make a lot of those squads. The game doesnt see it as you have Ibarbo so lets match you up against someone with David Luiz.gt Is there any way to make FUT work without purchasing points?Play trade and have fun. FUT is not a race. It is a year long mode and is structured as such with TOTY and TOTS in January and the end of the season respectively.

Wastes my time just so I can change the camera to make a decent pass. Penalties. What a fucking utter joke they are. Look so silly its embarrassing almost as if its bugged.FUT menus are extremely slow and unresponsive its silly.Another year of boring pacey bullshit.

Theres no space no matter what I do every time I think Im through a defender catches up and takes the ball. If I do manage to take a shot  times out of  one of the psychic defenders just slides to block in. In defence its just as bad as soon as someone starts running across the pitch forget it.

9297571,0,t1_d8uc2c2,Not with autodefending. You get even near the defender and theyll instatackle you. I play defense all the time in real life and it takes effort and good timing to mark then tackle. A slight turn with a deft touch or a smart bit of skill can wipe out even the best defender The AI has mostly taken that concept out the window. Just let the AI autotackle once you get near the player or sadistically hack them down and not even receive a card thats what Ive resorted to.... and it works when it shouldnt. Effective pressing is even easier this year somehow. At least previous years it didnt take a godlike effort to beat a twothree man block. Watch a team like Dortmund or Atletico press. They make sure to strategically block passing lanes while forcing opposing players to take unnecessary touches and drop back. In FIFA that just means going high pressure or spamming A and RB without any regard for a tactical layout. Dribbling at the highest level consists of using high end players to barge through areas and swinging crosses or easy passes into space. Its not fun or realistic its just shallow and pathetic. ,FIFA,d8uj869,2,t5_2qxh7

Instead use the second press choose a player to cover the space where you think the ball will go jockey and then youll be able to catch your opponent as soon as he touches the ball or better before he get it.  If the ball goes elsewhere switch to a player near the ball jockey switch to another and repeat the first step.

I remapped teammate contain to X and regular contain to L since I never use it.I only ever use teammate contain on the wings around my box or around midfield  else I will drag my defenders out of position and thats bad. They can have all the possession they want in areas that cant hurt me and I only really ever spring into action high pressure in the final rd right around my box. I find my opponents get frustrated with this and starts spamming L to force runs as he has no clear options and once I get the ball his shape is all over the place.One thing to take no notice of is shots on goal.

In FIFA  I havent found the benefit from using pacy strikers all that much.  Id rather have pace on the wingers.  For example Hawk on Manolo Gabbiadini with  chem gives him  Pace  Shooting and  Strength.  He has been unbelievable for me this year only  coins.

They then lost to a very inexperienced and not very well managed Belgium side straight out of the groups.And when you say the US finished just behind the WC champions I didnt realise that Colombia were WC champions?

Im so angry that Ive reached the point where even if I pack something of even a little value I wont have that momentary thrill. That ship has sailed. At this point its nothing more than relief. Relief because the excitement can only occur if theres a little bit of a surprise. At my investment point theres no surprise. I expect it. I expect at least something.

Youve got  days till January st. Lets assume you dont find the time to run for  days. That leaves us  days.  .km a day. Thats a lot!By your post Im assuming youre not the athletic type. Well I consider myself an above average runner. I participate in and complete  mile marathons. And I run about kms a day for  days in a week at best. The other days its necessary to give your legs rest.Let me propose an alternative.How about you do kms a day  days a week. Rest  day in between. That converts to about  miles till Jan st.And this is how the reward system worksYou get  for  miles. Now for every  miles extra you run you get  up to a maximum of . So  is your cap for achieving  miles and above. I enjoy seeing people put in an effort to get fit thats why Im proposing this to you as Id love to see you achieve your target.

Are they there purely so that EA can control the market? Are they there to allow players to get these special inform cards that they wouldnt otherwise be able to get? IMO the SBCs are mainly there to allow EA to control the market and counter inflation. These SBC cards are untradable meaning every single coin that went into getting them is wiped from the game. If  people all get the POTM Costa for an average of k thats  Billion coins wiped from the market if my math is correct. Now thats a hell of a lot of coins. Even if only  people get it its still  Billion coins from ONE SBC. EA have never had a better way of wiping coins off the market before. Its genius from a marketing stand point.

9922930,0,t3_5hkycc,OK guys Ive tried a lot of players at CAM including valero banega IF Bonaventura and even payet there in a hybrid.  I liked valero and bona a lot but as of the last week I kicked bona back to CM and Im playing LM IF Perotti at CAM on  chem I start him at cm and move him up ingame. He is insanely cheap for his value  compared to  for bona last I checked. So far I think Perottis better but its definitely close. Key stats  vision  short pass  dribble  acceleration  pace  long shot  stamina  star WF  star skill moves. He is perfect for a CAM but Id never play him at his original LM which is why I think he is able to be such a steal. He is elite in all these categories but Bonaventura has him beat in strength and finishing and is really well rounded. Perottis only weakness is his finishing but I discovered a caveat he has the finesse shooting trait. Outside the box it doesnt matter because he has solid long shots anyways but in close range hes been amazing at the finesse shots plus he has the  wf.  I dont understand how traits work but in my experience finessing has made his low finishing completely irrelevant and his shooting has been amazing for me leaving his only weakness for me as his lack of strength. He gets an assist pretty much every single game and scores every other game and as you can see he has elite stats in several areas.Valero was really good for me I still have him around. Banega I didnt really like too slow and sluggish. Bona I still like a lot his strength is crucial and is an all around beast.  Perotti is amazing and Ive been promoting this dude you can see my post history I got accused of trying to bump up his price lol but I just like the dude a ton and think he is one of the most amazing players and he has better stats than pretty much every CAM in the game.

9966373,0,t1_db6cu79,Thanks man. Much of this I try to utilize like defend with my CM not CBs and judicious passing. I use the finesse shot a lot and can see the value of the driven shot across the keeper. The skills moves seem to be a necessary evil. I basically rely on ball roll and body feint and thats it. Im surprised you used two MH players at CM  I presume because of your offensive wide mids? I use strong pacey LBRBs instead of LMRM which certainly cuts down on my opponents counters down the flank but doesnt do much in terms of offense. My CMs are usually one defensive minded and one offensive playmaker. Honestly if I could score  or more goals per game I would win about  more of my matches.

Because its set up to be exciting when you are in the lead so computers players get boosted especially in physical stats. Its not a concpiracy just a lazy way of making ai. Have a video of asamoah trying to tackle reus and asamoah is sent flying as reus seem to have  strength and balance. I have noticed that these things are more frequent when you are playing cups or ens of divisions less so when playing current totw. Div  in singleplayer fut and legendary can be easier than professional at times it just depends on how what match it is. Up  or  and the next corner you will concede just the way its programmed.

Pure simulations tend make for shitty gameplay actually. Also written code is errorprone and bugs can ruin fairness if they favor a certain player systematically.So there is no reasonable ground to assume that FIFA was a perfectly fair videogame to begin with. EA would also never make such a bold claim themselves. If they did they would have to prove it somehow or at least make it plausible otherwise their claim would not have any validity because it cant be verified when its closed source.We only have a discussion like this though because some people struggle to differentiate between virtual reality and real world football. They assume that the videogame FIFA must be fair only because it is graphically themed after a real life game which is perfectly fair football.Thats not a reasonable assumption though its just a category mistake.,FIFA,dcaeeei,1,t5_2qxh7

Im a BarcelonaPique fan so Im going to make him work.To get one thing out of the way and you should hopefully already know this switch offside trap to cover in custom tactics.Youll need to look deeper into his stats to understand Piques pace.  That  number is going to be misleading.  Has  acceleration and  sprint speed.  He also has  agility.  So when in stride hell seem faster than  but if he needs to turn and start running hell feel like hes stuck in quicksand.Youll want the correct chemistry style.  Pique is lacking pace more than anything but he also lacks aggression.  His defending stats are near perfect as they are  theyll all be  regardless of which defensive chemistry style you use.  According to Futbin Shadow will only put his sprint speed  points higher than anchor  vs .  Youll have to make a decision whether that extra  points is worth  points of aggression which he desperately wants as well as a maxed out strength stat.  Anchor also allows him to reach a jumping stat of  which along with  heading accuracy and being  will absolutely translate to goals from corners.Piques performance is also going to be very dependent on his CB partner.  Your other CB is going to need to cover for Pique when hes beat for pace so hell need to be a great deal faster at the expense of physicality if it comes to that.  Youll most definitely want Shadow on your second CB.,FIFA,dcjr5hb,17,t5_2qxh7

10374091,0,t1_dcjxxh7,So what I feel each one does after about  games of using it between  and Possession I feel this makes my players run closer to me when theyre off my ball on the offense set up better triangles work the middle of the field a little more. Essentially I find it a lot easier to string together multiple passes with it.Team Pressing This one I feel the most for sure my players are much more aggressive when it comes to winning the ball back and winning it back higher up the pitch. My Center Backs even play a higher line and on occasions win the ball in my opponents half. It can overwhelm an opponent as I feel that quick turnovers is one of the most efficient ways to score. However this puts pressure on my CBs to perform.Attacking This one is a bit of a mystery. I think this also makes my players push higher and overload my opponents. I think it just honestly works well with the other two to ensure I win the possession battle where its important my possession in my opponents box vs. my opponents possession in my box.I would say the con is that its risky you can get caught out on counters. Id also say you need the skill to hold the ball and make quality one on one tackles. However the reward is goals opponent suffocation and leaving a match feeling you dominated.,FIFA,dcjys1e,1,t5_2qxh7

10390784,0,t3_5ossi5,Ive been playing fifa  on PC since release. The pros is I like the overall experience matches are good I love my monitor quality is great. Content is there just as consoles.The only dislikes I have are. Cheaters. People who boosts their players to  ratings. Its very rare to come up against them but when you do its not fun. But again its very rare. I have played over  matches in total Ive only met a cheater like  or  times maybe abit more but not many.. The other kind of cheaters. Coin farmers. Matches where the opponent passes the ball around then leaves after  seconds it wont give you a loss but he gets a win and its just a waste of time. Some of them can be generous with scoring own goals but not all.. Players are generally much more expensive on PC compared to consoles. But the market is healthy always tradingbuyingselling going on.. The player base in my area europe is more than great I find matches all the time. And in weekend league a match pops up within . seconds every time its almost instant.. Weekend league is only  matches with worse rewards. No dont get started on the debate of lol  matches is good  is too much I pretty much disagree.Either way overall experience is I love it. I dont feel the urge to play on consoles. One tip is to buy a CD key from key sites and activating it on origin. Buying the game directly from origin is way too expensive.,FIFA,dclv03c,1,t5_2qxh7

10392212,0,t3_5osqz3,. Build a better team some teams just click for you and everything they do is amazing while other teams are just handicapped to the maximum for weird reasons.. Change custom tactics. If all custom tactics doesnt seem to work well for you take default tactics with cover and speed up to .. These things happens to all people and you do them aswell to your opponent. The difference is you should stop looking at what people do focus pure only on your own team yourself. If he has the ball focus on how to tackle the ball dont look at how perfect he is playing. Same when you get the ball and youre attacking dont look at other people.. Space is created by yourself by the positioning of players their work rates their instructions. If a guy gives you no space all the time that means that he is reading your plays and predicting your passing aswell as your attacking players have high defensive rates and doesnt stay in free positions.. Ill repeat experiment with another team if the one you have is not working for you. Hint I played amazing with premier league team I upgraded everything to a better team with nainggolan manolas florenzi.. I started experiencing exactly the same youre experiencing right now. I sold everyone I built a new team and its now amazing for me again.. Take a break from the game. Once youve not played for a few days your attention span becomes higher thus you will play better and not handicap yourself and you will start noticing playswhat to do better. Sometimes if youre not in the mood to play or too tired or lost too muchraging it will change the way you see the game and you will most likely play much worse. Especially if you have played too much.. Get gud. No but seriously I remember thinking like this when I was struggling to rank up from division . I was like how do people always run at me with  defenders I have no space to do anything.. I cant attack I cant shoot yada yada yada. Now that Im consistently elite in WL I look back on these times and really notice that I was just quite badplayed a very predictable playstyle with lacking mechanics.

Once the market gets flooded again and he doesnt get another totw for a few weeks I can see his otw card going for k. All of this of course is riding on him getting an IF. Arsenal didnt win the match and they conceded so it is feasible that he doesnt.

Name position height weight work rate weak foot skill moves attributes  everything. Its really frustrating to find a high potential CB who is  or a high potential CAM with a  star weak foot or a high potential LW with a low attacking work rate.Youth academy players dont even look like their avatars most of the time. Sometimes theyre not even the same skin color. On top of all that this year the commentators dont even say the youth academy player names ingame.If the only thing they added next year was the ability to edit your youth academy players Id be happy.

Candreva has pretty well rounded stats and is surprisingly good with Hawk chemistry style. Hes not a game changer like IF perisic but he always puts in consistently solid performance for me so I havent found a need to replace him yet.

Pretty much for player instructions which are very important for this formation have two btb high stamina cms set to free roam allows more space going forward and the CAM with the instructions stay forward and free roam. One of the other most important things is you have the ccb having the most on ball skills and interceptions then your other defenders whilst being instructed to do aggressive interceptions.

10625668,0,t1_ddbpdj3,Nice.Maybe you can answer this speculation I have.I am almost positive Fifa  is built off of Fifa .Reasons EA said Fifa  was  years in development  to me this says EA split teams and one worked on Fifa  using s assets. The other team started working on  using s assets. They had to add in some of Fifa s new controls and that is why they feel odd or you have to press the button  times to do the action.Shielding does not work like  did and for  they brought over the feature but could not make it work like  so they called it a new shielding mechanic.In  you could use LT to fight for space and fight for spots where aerial balls would land. The LT button does not fight for landing spots at all in .Passing it appears to be of two minds almost always it feels more like  than  but it also feels like it has some sort of hybrid  auto correction appliedPlayer switching I personally feel like  switching was better than .  also had an issue that was fixed for  which was players auto switching during ground passes with air balls only option on. Which curiously  also has a problem with.To me there are just many many signals that say Fifa is really built off Fifa  with some of s features added.This isnt a bad thing to develop  using  in fact I feel like its the only way they could move  to frostbite but it certainly would explain why some of the crispness felt with controlling  is absent with ,FIFA,ddbyg2w,4,t5_2qxh7

10849557,0,t1_ddz1jzu,gt The through balls in fifa  are rubbish at times.Atleast they are somewhat better than in FIFA .gt If i want to do a through ball half the times i want to pass it through the right side of the defender yet the cpu chooses the left for me. Even though i use a guy with  passing.A tip might be to pay a closer attention to the actual direction of the run which will more often than not adjust your passing direction regardless of where you want to put it.gt It never feels like we are in  percent control even when the situation should be an easy one.Half the job in FIFA is to learn how to play the engine. The other half is to outsmart your opponent or stop him from outsmarting you.,FIFA,ddz1zty,1,t5_2qxh7

10850790,0,t1_ddz63rt,Well think of it as a combination of what I said earlier and a vicinity thing to the defender. The way I view it is that there has to be very clear open space and a run in that direction into that particular space if Im going to go for it. If there is ANY chance that the pass might go to the defender murphys law applies. If it can go wrong it will. Which is why constantly attempting risky passes will do you more harm than good. Wait for that perfect opportunity and clear space  and if you dont have it pass to someone else who might have it. Dont rush your passes.etc.etc.That being said even though you do everything right the game wont always apply. But you can minimize a lot this way with experience and accuracy. But there is usually a lot more to consider than people realize and playing in a controlled manner will atleast help. Accuracy is also a thing as it isnt always as easy to execute things accurately with the right power on the fly while being under pressure. That takes a lot of experience and practice.,FIFA,ddz6kgq,1,t5_2qxh7

I havent changed the way I play FIFA  passing is much easier to perform and if you look at the distribution of passes around the team you can see that it is heavily focused on my front  players especially. And I dont have many passes for the sake of it. It is all with attacking intent!,FIFA,de7484e,-12,t5_2qxh7

SMH are with all due respect conspiracy theories and I believe its reasonable to assume that people believe in them for the same reasons that we believe in other conspiracy theories. A trait which links to most conspiracy theories is our inclination to see patterns aka pareidolia. It makes people believe that luck is one sided a pattern even though the streaks are random.I fully understand that you ask for this to be about skill to a larger extent. On the other hand please consider the fact that many FUT modes use Elo matchmaking meaning that the average skill gap is . When you effectively take skill out of the equation in most matches luck will play a larger role.,FIFA,denv5w1,1,t5_2qxh7

The marker system is just another joke and corners are more repetitive than ever. Shielding the ball was perfect in  yet theyve changed it for no reason in .

11098733,0,t1_depvcxx,Thats what makes it interesting.  I promise Im not making this up.  It must have to do with my opponent inputing the shoot command.  Then there is a delay in network communication with my system so my keeper is unaware the ball has even been shot for a split second after the ball has left the opponents foot.  Hence what Im saying is the delay in communication between an opponents system and mine causes the input delay or button lag.

They are chill casual players who dont care enough about the game to put in the effort and learn and get better. And thats fine. Its their right to be like that and play casual. And they get to play season and a nie qualifying tournament with their casual mindset.But those players shouldnt have access to the most competitive part of Fifa there is. A tournament where players play who actually make a living with Fifa. A Tournament with essentially thousands of Dollars at the line.  They should play their chill Fifa and let the competitive people play in competitive game modes.Therefore I bleive the average player who actually gives a crap whether he does well or not has no issue qualifying in the Weekend league whatsoever.,FIFA,df7zkey,-3,t5_2qxh7

Maybe at that moment the game doesnt know which goal is yours and which is your opponents meaning that because it was technically an own goal your opponent received the goal rather than you as it was his player putting the ball into an unassigned net so FIFA assumes he was scoring a goal. But then again I could be completely wrong and something like this would be extremely hard to reproduce unless you have debug tools. If I had to guess its not gonna be possible to repro unless you get the same lag spike close to the end as that looks like what confuses the server.,FIFA,dfd2oda,2,t5_2qxh7

This is the one big draw back because ive had three or so controllers and the batteries always come slightly loose which idk if its in my head or true but when theyre loose there can be some inaccuracy in timing passes shots and excessive button delay. On the plus side i just got the new controller and the added grip is wonderful especially for FUT champs when my controller can get a bit sweaty.

11421147,0,t3_631ihv,All you gotta do is the following . Open bronze packs for your contracts fitness cards injury cards and store all players. Sell or use these players depending on their demand due to sbc. Also sell the squad fitness training cards but keep the single ones.. Get yourself into division  or so to make easy coins if youre not in fut champs as it is a casual way to have fun and grind those coins.. Do whatever sbc you can with players in your club. Dont do ones where you need to buy a whole team or so unless its part of a group which will give you a very good reward.. Try to qualify for fut champs. You dont have to get to gold or anything but try to make it somewhere in silver and then keep on improving from there.. Buy players on Thursday and sell during the weekend league considering youre not in it. This is because many people sell rewards on Thursday as that when they come out. Take advantage of this and buy low sell high.. Always use players you know are good and not simply because everyone uses them or they look good. You can do that later when you have a warchest of coins and youre bored.Good luck and have fun and sorry for making it really long,FIFA,dfqkq41,4,t5_2qxh7

11432674,0,t3_637gfz,gt Example here gt If that player is right footed I would just finesse it into the far corner with two bars at the moment you shot. Works consistently for me. Maybe even earlier for more style points. Your direction towards goal is one of the most important things and to me the positioning of your player towards goal in this situation was optimal for the finesse shot into the far corner.Experiment abit with power until you find the sweet spot.Or you could tap a through ball down to the other player that would atleast ensure a goal.,FIFA,dfrvrbw,1,t5_2qxh7

Once he tries to pass your player you move into his body and push him off by pressingholding circle or B for xbox. Usually works quite well.It has to be practiced though. Dont push circle to early as if you are not close to his body you will instead go in for a standing tackle and most likely miss and be outplayed.That is however mostly if you are defending as last man. If you have your team behind the ball you should really do as other people say leave the defence alone and focus on blocking dangerous passes or shots.,FIFA,dfs3noq,2,t5_2qxh7

EA have given every player a rating and that rating is supposed to represent how good a player is in the game. Thats the whole basis of the ultimate team system and their pack sales buy packs get better players win more games. It seems to me that this year more than most the OP players are being abused. Even super teams use players like smalling and butland. You would never see this in real life soccer teams would try to get the best players not the fastest or strongest. This just shows that something is fundamentally wrong with the game and most competitive games try to fix this with balances and tweaks. I know that would be more difficult in FIFA since its a different kind of competitive game but it could be done if EA put in the time and effort and cared about making it better.

They should put in tournaments again andor some online game mode that isnt quite as competitive. I miss making different teams for fun without all the pressure of performing. Seasons are boring as hell and rewards there suck. Im mostly in div . Using experimental teams in WL qualification some time but this isnt very rewarding. Ive qualified and played some WLs ending up with  wins. Now when I qualify I usually cant be bothered playing more than  games. Its too much stress and not enough fun. I suspect it is set up this way so that ppl will spend more money on drafts just because there arent much else. Drafting is also frustrating because of the high level leaving the good prizes for the players who are already raking in on WL. ,FIFA,dg1p6d7,1,t5_2qxh7

Did get IscoCoutinhoHamsik multiple times.  Never packed Benteke but I bought him off the market.  All in all I probably did around  or so of these packs during the futbirthday promo Had been saving  players and bought a bunch of discard in forms...  Sold OTW pogba for . mil  and put it all into these packs...  Hit the jackpot when I packed  Neymar and sold him for . mil  bought a few players and put the rest into OTW Guarantee packs again...at this point my team is stacked whether I want bund BPL or Calcio its been stacked but I dont really have a lot of room available to make any upgrades...  and while I dont have any more guaranteed packs  I do have about . mil saved now.

11549761,0,t3_64rnnv,They should just make all consumables have a single set price  coins or something simple like that. You should only be able to bid on players but you should have limited bids for a specific time period and you should only be allowed to list a player you bought via the transfer market after another specific time period. You may not like that but it would severely cut down on sniping and allow much more fair control of the market. They also need to permanently ban anyone that buys or promotes the black market coins.

11550390,0,t3_64v2ab,The thing is if the game becomes more dependant on skill what would be the point in making superteams since you could just have an average team and play the game all the time and destroy people with decent teams. Its a game which means it should be fun yeah fifa can be fun sometimes. Everyone wants to have the best players because they perform the best thanks to their stats which yes make it easier to play with and it can feel like you have nothing to do. I packed Sergio ramos the other day and you can feel the difference its alot easier to defend with him that with Danny Shittu and thats the whole point of the game. Thats why you pay the big bucks for those game changing players because it makes the game easier and you should have more fun playing fifa.Sorry if I didnt explain very well,FIFA,dg58n8f,1,t5_2qxh7

Dont know how often you play or how often you are here on reddit but I got countless of stuff that was just bullshit. You have countless of stuff here on reddit alone that shows complete bullshit. Just two examples the CPU teammate tends to head the ball out of the box to another goal even if you are completely alone with a selected player. Or the refs that caves peneltys against you when your opponent runs into you after look away like Robert Hoyzer while you got murdered by the defender and got nothing. That alone is a thing that shows you that there is indeed something. You could even ask the pros. Why do you think use people like boraslegend bronze benching? Because there is something they wanna avoid. If there isnt something they wont do it. But probably those top  player are also just noons without skill.,FIFA,dgeb4yw,-2,t5_2qxh7

If you play Eden Hazard on  chem hes still going to be awesome.The point of the chemistry system is to restrict you. Consider the offside rule. It severely restricts how a team can attack. We could complain that it makes the game less exciting that we see fewer goals scored because of it and that it deemphasizes the athleticism of footballers. What kind of sport would do such a thing?The offside rule forces footballers to be clever and deliberate and artful and technically sound. A system that imposes restrictions hardly tough restrictions like the chemistry system will require players to be more clever.Or just suck it up and play your Ronaldo off chem at striker surrounded by Prem players.

People like Gabe Jesus and if he were to get another IF his value would be a little more steady as he will not be getting a TOTS card or anything. And people like using him and it would be his best card. Basically for k if he gets another IF his IF would be around k for sure. So even if the OTW card is only just as valuable as the SIF its worth it. Who knows maybe his IF would be a LW or RW so his OTW would be a lot more valuable because its a ST card,FIFA,dgwu76u,12,t5_2qxh7
11793554,0,t1_dgwtrvg,gtIn FIFA there are very few players on teams and some of the players are on a team for the social media exposure and dont even earn. Because of this mentality we dont have the best players at the events.This is just not true a vast majority of the players who are there made an effort to complete all games because they knew that they could reach that stage.There as even a guy there who worked full time on weekends and still found time to play because he knew he was a top player.Saying that you dont have the best players is ridiculous there would probably be like  or  new players if everyone had time to play maybe even none.gtEvery Pro player in every esport is signed to a team. This team has sponsors and pays the pros so they can work hard at their craft.This is also majorly flawed since FIFAs esports scene is basically at a new start in past years barely anyone would follow it there have been more team signings this year than in every year combined.If you look at every other single esport they all started without pro teams the teams were always basically a group of high level friends who got together to compete in tournaments CLG and TSM in LoL for example is a big example of this. It was only a few years later that actual companies and pro teams started appearing in the esports scenes for the big games.LoL had a good matchmaking system with ladders they barely had any professional teams on Season  hell even in Season  they didnt while still being a really popular game.My point is most pro teams probably never followed FIFAs pro scene prior to this year once this year ends especially after the BerlinLondon event pro teams will truly know who the best players are and Im willing to bet that at least the top  in the world after this year will be signed to pro teams unless they dont want to.Also people dont give a shit about the better players most of the people who dont watch Regionals its because they just dont like watching FIFA being played if you had better players who no one knows anyways that wouldnt make more people watch.Youve said it yourself the biggest number of people watching was when AA was playing hes really far from being one of the best yet he was the one people watched the most because hes well known.Everyone whos well known probably has enough time to play the  games anyways so that would only mean that more unknown people would qualify and possibily the known ones would be left out causing even less viewers potentially.,FIFA,dgwu7x9,2,t5_2qxh7
