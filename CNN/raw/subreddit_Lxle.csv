9659314,0,t1_da253um,Im using Manjaro these days but the LXLE system is still installed.I did nothing special during the install its a default install. Notable is that when right clicked the upper main monitor includes desktop preferences while the lowersecondary monitor a right click includes ob preferences Open Box preferences. On the LXLE forum what appears to be the official account basically admitted that they know nothing about multiple screens.,Lxle,da3pnye,1,t5_3ac2f
