989606,0,t1_chgap6y,Based on this comment made by rFiveTwoZero its heavily implied that you need information on this and DONT have FaceBook then you cant get information.I mean no company name supplied no qualifications required supplied no salary details. Seems pretty lacking in important details.That aside based on this commentgt design and build a webpage to sell our products on but its quite complicated as it needs drop down boxes to build up items as quantities differIt seems like the front end would be easy to bash together in ASP.NET or MVC. Again though no details supplied.,Hull,chgrx7q,2,t5_2s4i6
