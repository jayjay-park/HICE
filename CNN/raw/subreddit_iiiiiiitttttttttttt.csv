693366,0,t1_cgirgwe,Powershell isnt really anything like bash or the cmd prompt.  Many of your CMD commands run in it and there are many preconfigured aliases to simulate the bash tools in nix but I think thats where the similarities end.  Working in Powershell is having an object oriented shell.  In my opinion once you get used to it every other shell sucks.  Sending objects down the pipeline without having to worry about formatting text is amazing.There is also the integration into .NET.  If you want to do something in PS that isnt supported out of the box you can build in the functionality yourself using .NET.,iiiiiiitttttttttttt,cgj364k,9,t5_2tfln

3004898,0,t1_co9ehl9,Cropping an image means removing some of the area. When you zoom in and part of the image doesnt fit onscreen that part has been cropped out. Cropping a video would not help me figure out when they say something. I would still have to listen towatch the entire thing.If you mean that I should edit the video such that out only contains the part with useful information this is a waste of time you still need the other parts of the video that introduce the tools that are being used so you know what they are and then you still need to listen through someone that likes how they sound rather than simply seeing someones note and saying oh you can list hidden files in cmd with dir ah or oh the powerball equivalent of man is GetHelp. My time would be better spent simply writing such a note myself.When you have a list of instructions particularly a tutorial on the computer its a simple thing to skip the parts you know and only look at the parts you dont. When you have a video you cant do that. You can try skipping this part but theres no clear separation of steps such as numbers in a list. Instead the author shows you how to do things in order. Skipping this step will likely skip the next step and half the step after thatexcept you cant how much you skipped so you can only skip a little bit at a time and may as well just watch it.Videos also cannot be stored in a single file that allows search and replace to easily find what you need. I have a large file with various notes and instructions on how to do things and when want to figure it out say how to ping a range of computers in powershell as I had to do earlier its much easier to just search my file which opens in my IDE for ping and get testconnection and look up the help for that than it is to open a directory of possibly hundreds of saved videos to search out the correct one then open that in another program and watch it.,iiiiiiitttttttttttt,co9gf0u,1,t5_2tfln

The layers build upon each other allowing for abstraction of specific functions in each one. The top th layer is the Application Layer describing methods and protocols of software applications. It is then held that the user is the th layer. Network appliances vendor like Cyberoam claim that Layer  allows IT administrators to identify users control Internet activity of users in the network set user based policies and generate reports by username.gtAccording to Bruce Schneier and RSAgtgt Layer  The individual person.gt Layer  The organization.gt Layer  Government or legal compliance gtSince the OSI layer numbers are commonly used to discuss networking topics a troubleshooter may describe an issue caused by a user to be a layer  issue similar to the PEBKAC acronym the IDTenT Error and also PICNIC gtPolitical economic theory  holds that the th layer is important to understanding the OSI Model.

I think the log file became to large to handle.Well keep this thing running until either the motherboard gives out or we replace our POTS system with VOIP. The latter being more likely. ,iiiiiiitttttttttttt,df6huvo,16,t5_2tfln

11285233,0,t3_6122an,Actually seen this before. A monitor will die when someone is working but its not a power failure i.e. its a backlight failure so the computer keeps dumping it info. Any programs you have open will remain open but unseeable on that screen. If you try and closerelaunch the program it will open back up on that screen.Good news is the fix is easy. Turn it off so the OS stops detecting it and moves everything to the working monitor. Leave it off until youre able to replace the broken one.,iiiiiiitttttttttttt,dfb5xnc,27,t5_2tfln

11654180,0,t3_666jb1,Ug security holes ahoy.  I have a customer who wont invest in cloud services because they are too expensive but they are still running a k server as a file share and it is limping along.  When it finally dies they are going to have to spend thousands to just get the data back thousands on an updated server and thousands in downtime.  But moving to BoxGSuite is just TOOOOOO expensive,iiiiiiitttttttttttt,dgh0kvm,4,t5_2tfln
