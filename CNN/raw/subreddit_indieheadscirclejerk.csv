5966695,0,t3_3x3k57,Id beg to differ. I for one love uMoonSafari. He is the embodiment of what every man woman or child should strive to be. He is absolutely stoked every minute of every hour of every day unable to feel any negative emotion. His bombastic euphoria allows him to even brave the shittiest of Fridays releases with a grand smile on his face utilizing unnecessary adjectives like killer or kickin or perhaps even poppalicious whilst doing so. He sees adventure everywhere from the bland realms of rmusic to the prospect of a festival in Toledo Ohio. He is the man who embodies every Smash Mouth song ever written even going as far as to look like the lead singer of Smash Mouth. He is the essence of every Capri Sun commercial youve ever seen. He is uMoonSafari the falloffthebone messiah,indieheadscirclejerk,cy1rjz7,7,t5_31zq8
