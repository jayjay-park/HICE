123400,0,t3_1vbwkm,I had the same issue with my younger mini. one day he just got really sick and was like dead. he would not eat anything and would throw up constantly. it was like something he picked up from one day to the next. we seriously thought he had parvo even though I had him for only a week and thats when I really started to blame myself. well when we took him to the vet they couldnt really determine what he was sick of but they mentioned it was something with his intestines. they gave him a shot and hazzah! he was back to himself as a puppy. since then we paid more attention to his diet and started feeding him merrick dry dog food in the real duck and sweet potato flavor which also has a five star rating on that pet advisor site. anyway since that mishap last year we have no problems whatsoever and both of my minis are very healthy. I can tell their diet has really affected them because their coats are amazingly soft and shinty instead of it being rough since its wirey. I buy the  pound bag and it lasts about . and smells good. ,schnauzers,ceshete,1,t5_2ssw6

3876173,0,t3_34twf4,We have a pair of minis that have both had bouts of pancreatitis.  One is diabetic and has Cushings his brother shows the early signs of Cushings.Both are getting Hills Digestive Care id low fat.  It is about .Because of their history with Pancreas issues we run as low a fat diet as we can but Otto the healthier pup was getting  fat canned food before his liver values started showing the signs he might be developing Cushings.For dry kibble Id talk to my vet.  I know there is an id dry as well.  Our two are on the canned because its easier for them to chew since both are missing a few teeth now and its easier to sneak Indys Vetoryl pills into.As for falsenegatives..... It could be the gut issues arent pancreatitis yet.  His last bout of pancreatitis had Indy at the vet one week for vomiting and just acting like he felt icky.  Pancreatitis snap test came back negative but his blood work was a little off for him.  IV fluids  he was a little dehydrated and antibiotics and he seemed fine.  A week later were back at the vet and the pancreas is well and truly kicking off.  Id keep a close eye on the pup and if she starts showing signs of belly pain or discomfort or start having really foul diarrhea get back to the vet for another round of blood work.,schnauzers,cqy4876,1,t5_2ssw6
