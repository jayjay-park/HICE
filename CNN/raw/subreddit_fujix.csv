Short word they are outpaced in every way by the Sony Ar for the simple reasons manual exposure cant be set to fastest flash sync speed and  zoom cant be moved around in realtime.Apart from that they work well and the XTrans has a way of mushing dust a bit so there is less editing necessary!,fujix,cgcuwuq,1,t5_2vjfp

4820360,0,t3_3gwcpo,It is a good lens. Separately they often run about US used. So to get one with an XE would be a great deal. Pricing may very in the UK. Coming from the XA I think youd find either the XE or E an upgrade. But really it comes down to the added features of the XE and if you think youd make use of them.

9785433,0,t3_5f6m8l,Im not sure if theyd do this in Norway but here in the US they just sent me the eye ring to put in myself when I called them to try to find a replacement instead of making me mail the camera out.   ampnbsp  I have to be very careful putting it in and pulling it out of my camera bag since it really seems to grip on the interior material and Im pretty sure it will easily rip in half again if I give it the chance.  Ive actually almost stopped using mine in favor of XT partially out of fear of ripping that thing out again. I realize thats a bit stupid but that eyepiece is part of the weather sealing of the camera and when it was missing you can feel air being pumped at your eye when using a zoom lens and zooming in or out. I worry too about rubber eyepiece chunks being lost inside the viewfinder there since mine at least was ripped rather than just being pulled out so Im not  positive that all of the pieces of it came out. I had to pull one small one out very carefully before replacing the ring with the new piece Fuji sent me so its possible that one or more ended up inside the camera before I saw it. Its also a pretty sizeable gap to just leave open while you wait  weeks to get a replacement part if you need to use the camera and its also a really silly part failure to cause a month of downtime while shipping it off to get it replaced.  ,fujix,daj9nfu,2,t5_2vjfp

10090734,0,t1_dbmsley,Hmm I didnt really consider adapted lenses. Im fine with full manual most of the native but offbranded ones are fully manual anyway.Is there some gotcha with such adapter?

10135702,0,t1_dbsc3p7,I wouldnt say it wasnt for me I would just say that the features that were most attractive to me each had their own quirk which made it pretty unuseable. The ovf is nice but when I use it with my mm . the focus squares are so large you have to rely on the bottom right hybrid screen to tell whats in focus. At this point youre essentially using a mini EVF instead of the whole ovf. I felt that I was sacrificing having a big beautiful evf in the XT so I can have an ovf with a hybrid screen that suffers from a few design quirks. In addition if you use the image review when using the OVF the brightness adjustments do not effect it. For example if you set your EVF brightness to  and use automatic image review in the OVF it will default to a dimmer setting. This is pretty bad since if you are in bright daylight the exposure will look completely off.Once I realized these two issues I began to think about the other trade offs. I was giving up faster autofocus k video and better manual controls all for this OVF that I didnt utilize. Also the iso dial sucks. Ive heard people make up excuse for why it isnt that bad but it sucks...like really bad. On film cameras that setup is fine because you arent changing your ISO often. For events I just cant deal with it and Id much rather have the dial set up on the XT.Also I was under the impression that even though the XT has k I thought image quality at p would be the same on the Xpro vs the XT. This is not the case the bitrate is almost x higher on the xt than the xpro even at p. I dont shoot video as often but when I do paid gigs Id prefer to use this as a B cam than anything else. So Im basically paying  to upgrade to the XT. I knew if I didnt return it I would regret it and so Ill take advtange of it while I can. ,fujix,dbsopma,0,t5_2vjfp

Grip plus  batteries plus camera weighs around  grams which is more than the D alone. Its fine to do so with the Nikon by itself. Sure the Fuji lens is lighter but lets not act like its an enormous amount. I shot Nikon for years and gave up my full frame kit to go mirrorless.
