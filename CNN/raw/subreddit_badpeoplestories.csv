1340149,0,t3_29at8o,This reminds me of why I dont play chess anymore. I moved around a lot as a kid and I found chess teams to be a pretty constant source of dorktastic friends wherever I went. Until my last and longest move where the school had this super serious business chess team  or so I was lead to believe. They had a ranking system and points and they went to a regional tournament every year despite only being an elementary school team. I was just on the cusp of making the regional team  just two wins away. I was playing against this kid named Erik and his mom was officiating the match and one other a big nono already but they were strapped for judges that day so whatever.For those who arent familiar chess has a rule where a move isnt official until someones hand is off the piece theyre holding but the instant they do that move is set in stone. Well Erik managed to play right into a trap Id laid and saw his mistake just a second too late. His hand was off his queen and she was mine. Until he slapped his hand back onto her and said nervously NO! I take that back! There were hisses from our tiny audience and someone ran to get Eriks mom from the other match.Naturally she ruled in favor of her son despite my protests and him outright admitting that hed made a mistake and that by all the rules his bad move should stand. I played fast and angry the rest of the match trying to psych him into making another slipup. But his illegal queen decimated my ranks and eventually ground us into a draw. It would have certainly been a win for me without her on the field.Now I could understand all this though I knew it was wrong and I was a bit ticked off. But Eriks mom had to put the final seal on my anger by apologizing. I put quotes around that because apologies do not come with the phrase But he really didnt mean to do that! You should be more understanding next time. That was it for me  I came to a couple more meetings but my heart wasnt in it and refusing to play any match she officiated left me on the sidelines more often than not. I lost just enough matches to ensure I wouldnt make the team and quit immediately after. I didnt have the words to articulate just why that moment killed it for me back then but I do now. If a group of adults expects kids to take an activity seriously enough to enter tournaments and be constantly grading them on their performance the rankings chart was updated after every meeting and posted in the cafeteria for all to see they should take it just as seriously and treat everyone fairly even when they screw up.In short fuck Ronda and everyone like her  theyre killing peoples enjoyment of something theyre passionate about.,badpeoplestories,cikdrv5,6,t5_2xcqj

Then when he took me to retrieve my meds from the pharmacy he left me to go in there and wait by the desk by myself for half an hour only coming in from the car once to check what was taking so long.

Nothing thats happened in what Ive described had actually taken place in school and in my opinion is pretty much onpar with the other things Ive read. Its based off of her as a person.

He will lie telling you that youre remembering things wrong and tell everyone around you all sorts of bullshit. This includes saying that youre talking shit about them to try and get them on his side.I get this all the time any bit of niceness is taken and run with and if I turn to say no it turns in to a mud slinging match of everything he has done for me which I am yet to see I have also noticed the way his family treats him tiptoeing around him. His mother always calling to check up on him and he yells at them telling them how awful they are then suddenly goes back to being over the top sweet.
