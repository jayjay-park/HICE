8515279,0,t1_d65wqr3,You know...Ive thought of that. She had such a crazy life. She traveled durning the gold rush in a covered wagon her mom died of cholera during the trip. She was  at the time. Then raised by her father and  uncles on the family estate in California where they had native american indians as slaves that picked their cotton. Indians broke into the farm and mutilated their animals poured molasses on their beds... horrible run ins with indians. Because of all of the above she was sent to NY to live with her aunt. On the return ship home was when the wreck happened. She got married and had lots of kids including one set of girl twins in which one died the same day. Exactly one year after the girl twins birth she gave birth to a set of male twins and one of the boys died the same day as well. quite a coincidence. crazy life.But this wreck wasnt that big of a deal...its not like they starved for food or had too much hardship. I think people could come up with a much more dramatic story than this one. I dont mind posting this particular story. ,Shipwrecks,d65yvve,3,t5_2s732
