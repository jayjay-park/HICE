I highly suspect that Gibson himself had no understanding at all about processing power though and so he just assumed that the more data a computer had the more powerful it was. ,cyberpunk_fiction,d95r8pz,1,t5_3h3am

The brutal and desperation elements are pervasive in every aspect of life and are the reason i wonder if any kidfriendly book could do that without being inappropriate for kids.,cyberpunk_fiction,dd1sddd,3,t5_3h3am
