Could give you the energy you need and help fill you up! Also with all those allergies you should be taking vitamins to fill in the gaps of what youre not getting. Its not all about calorie consumption think about your overall nutrition.As for exercises when I was in college I found it helpful to just keep a couple weights in my dorm to pick up whenever I had a lull in studying. Also whenever you have some free time start doing crunches and squats. Thats a relatively quick and low maintenance way to get some real workout time in! ,FTMFitness,cogsajm,1,t5_2xkbw

9736976,0,t1_dacv1ve,Yeah I totally agree RE waiting the full time. Out of curiousity did it cause a lot of pain or just set you back with your scar care?,FTMFitness,dadamk1,1,t5_2xkbw
10926369,0,t3_5vtqf1,Im on Enanthate and honestly its difficult to say if it helps build muscle better than other forms.Ive also been on Sustanon Nebido and gel. I actually liked the gel the most in terms of level stability and feel energised. Sustanon made me feel a bit manic but my levels were WAY too high when I was on that. Same with Nebido.The trouble is that Ive worked out pretty much all the time Ive been able to whilst on T outside of surgery recoveries. So I can now lift more weight and do more reps but its likely just because Ive trained.I do feel like on gel I was able to put on muscle and workout just the same as I am on injectable. I guess a place to try searching for more info would be bodybuilding forums where people talk about steroid use. Ive found weirdly helpful information there about doses and cycles! ,FTMFitness,de6z8jv,1,t5_2xkbw
11194094,0,t1_df0sfgn,Yes.  Oddly enough thats where I first noticed fat loss when I had a lot to lose a few years ago.BTW thats not to say you shouldnt do weight training its just saying that you have to prioritize one goal over the other for now.,FTMFitness,df0u5gb,2,t5_2xkbw
