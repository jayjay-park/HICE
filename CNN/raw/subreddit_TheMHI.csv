8546445,0,t1_d69ofhs,That got to me too. Z from the original is big strong and a master of guns. But he is clumsy as hell not great at figuring out people or totally understanding whats going on. He is a comic book character but with demonstrable flaws. MHI is a wonderful entertaining read not too deep and a fun ride. Very interesting characters and an awesome approach to the world of monsters. However Grunge was a big miss. Chad is a master of everything and is a dick about it. His major weakness is being crippled but even that gets cured randomly and quickly leaving him with no real drawbacks. This seemed like a novel that Trump might have consulted on heavy as it was with conservative ideals. Full of God rationalized fury and laughing at liberal thinking. The main thing that really bugged me was that Chad is a huge douchebag. Laughs at the way he treats women. He hates his mom with barely a reason to show for it save that she didnt think the way Chad does. He of course reacts in a mature and understanding manner....nope. But with his vile hate of his mother and his honest desire to kill her or see her dead he is still an agent of Heaven.It was nice for brief times when it felt like a fun MHI ride. But on the whole a disappointing read. This seemed like the next Rogue Warrior novel rather than MHI. ,TheMHI,d69vktm,2,t5_328z5
