Ive got a pretty good spidey sense for I should go look on the other side of that log and Ive been keeping an eye out for elm snags etc. forever. No morels not one not even once. There are a lot of granite incursions into this area little bits of the NH side that have snuck over the river and I suspect the soil just isnt sweet enough.

I used to work with invasive species management so I spent a lot of time staring at and comparing ampelopsis and vitis leaves so as to distinguish them.If OP wants to be sure she can follow the vine back further and check to see if the bark is peeling in long strips or cut a small vine to see if the pith is white or brown.

3301876,0,t3_2xynps,Just FYI norfolk pine is not a pine either. A couple of points... Pregnant women need to be careful of a lot of things generally considered edible including some very common members of the mint family.  Many things that are potentially toxic to livestock are not considered toxic to humans either because a we are not horses and cows andor b we dont eat kilograms of it a day Many things that people around the world consume every day are toxic in large enough quantities but still considered nontoxic when consumed in normal quantities.  Theres the assumption that you arent extracting and concentrating say turpentine from the pine tree and taking shots. Its still technically eating pines but you might kill yourself doing it.So other than those caveats Im not aware of any toxic pines and by pine I mean something in the genus Pinus and by toxic I mean in typical quantities prepared in typical ways.,foraging,cp4n2fu,8,t5_2s2kj
3624541,0,t3_31vud3,I found a great spot to pick these little guys. I have been doing research about collecting mature miners lettuce but when it comes to the younger variety whats the best way to pick it? Should I cut it at the stems closer to the base? The stems are my fav part when theyre this young. Should I pick every other whole plant from the roots while not overharvesting so they can reseed properly for next year? Should they be treated similarly to more mature lettuce and pick closer to the leaf?Please advice. Thanks,foraging,cq5fang,2,t5_2s2kj

3987727,0,t3_3654fd,You raise an interesting question but let me start by saying that phrasing it that way makes it sound like you might taste first before knowing the identity of the plant. Usually that is dangerous. Disclaimer aside humans have adapted to enjoy sweeter flavors in general because plants can use bitterness as a warning sign of poisonous constituents to deter predators that are often humans from cutting killing taking theirs seeds. Trusting your instincts is as important to me as scientific knowledge of plants. But that means that they are both really really  important especially in a survival situation. I think the answer is yes but cant think of an example. Indigenous peoples havehad scientific classifications for plants that were at least as sophisticated as those  pre DNA testing. Western scientists at the time of contact with native Americans wrote it off because it was based in a noncivilized form but they really knew their shit. I am trying as well to hone my senses to actually get to know plants beyond taxonomical data. ,foraging,crau41p,6,t5_2s2kj
