5493165,0,t1_cwdnebr,Mariko will not get elected.  Not a chance.  None of the slate members will get elected and that is EXACTLY what Mazen is banking on.  Because when all their ballots are exhausted meaning that they are officially out of the running their votes will get transferred to the next person still going... which Nadeem hopes is him.  ,CambridgeMA,cwdsxf8,0,t5_2vgha
5545574,0,t3_3qyfhl,They all say a lot of the same things so I look for differences in their focus andor background. I like Kathleen Kellys big picture perspective that comes from her being a social worker.  She wants to support children as a whole not just children as students. Ive met and like Manikka Bowman. As a black woman who grew up in subsidized housing I think she has something to add to the committee.Pia Cisternino is well qualified and I like what she says about special education and students with different learning styles. Kathleen Kelly is definitely my  vote but havent decided my  and  order for Manikka and Pia.,CambridgeMA,cwkh9u6,6,t5_2vgha

10483234,0,t1_dcv7p0c,Its super low risklow return so its better for people already retired or getting close to it and looking to very conservatively grow their money. If thats you go for it! If not mutual funds would be a better way to go. ,CambridgeMA,dcwdsnv,1,t5_2vgha
