1414238,0,t3_2ab2td,Just because Sven kept his word in technicality doesnt mean he wasnt a major fucking asshole OP.  When youre in a FWB open relationship theres still a code of conduct you ought to be following to prevent hurting your partner and letting them know what theyre getting into.  Being in an open relationship doesnt mean you should just go blindside your partner like that because oh well I can!  But its not like Sven gave a shit about that. Did Faye not tell Sven at the very beginning that shed leave the moment he had sex with another girl?  Yes quite angrily in fact.  Its clear from the start she didnt want an open relationship she wanted to have a physical relationship with Sven that might hopefully develop into a more cohesive one over time.  Of course shed get upset when he just banged another girl out of nowhere!   And of course shed leave!  That was like her major precedent going into the relationship to begin with!On the other hand did Sven tell her ahead of time that he was gonna hook up with Gina like you would in a healthy open relationship?   No he just fucking did it he blindsided her and she got to just leave brokenhearted and in shock.  Its completely and totally natural to be angry in that situation!  Even if it wasnt what he did but how callous he was about it and how little warning he gave her and how little he cared about Fayes end of the relationship when he KNEW itd probably lead to the relationship ending anyways.  An open relationship should still be a healthy one and Sven was willing to lie so he could keep having sex with Faye.  Uncool. Speaking of healthy things one reason Svens intern threatened to tell Faye was because of the potential health and STD risk involved.  That something Faye should absolutely know about whether Sven likes it or not free agency be damned.  When youre in an genuine open relationship like that you always ALWAYS make sure the other partner knows whats up down there.  What if Sven didnt tell her accidentally caught something from Gina kept going at it and suddenly Faye wound up with herpes or chlamydia over some girl she didnt know?  Free agency be damned a persons immediate health risk takes precedence over Svens selfish desire to hide his actions from Faye.  And honestly if he was always being so open and honest why did he feel the need to hide his actions from Faye?  Why did he start behaving like it was an exclusive relationship just to spring this on her out of nowhere?  Why did he manipulate a girl with borderline PTSD depression and massive anxiety problems into a relationship if he clearly wasnt going to be honest with her about his goingons and when he KNEW from the START that she didnt want to stay if he was banging other girls?  Honestly thats a major part of what made him the asshole  FBW relationship or not Sven didnt care about Fayes feelings at all.  He could absolutely not give a shit he made no effort to keep the relationship in any way healthy and ultimately tried to hide his actions from her that he KNEW shed want to break up over.  Thats a horrible thing to do even if youre FBW  again that doesnt give you a free pass to be an awful person.  Look I take it youre a Sven fan  thats great Im a massive Sven fan too.  But you gotta understand all his serious flaws and accept those too before you start blindly defending all his shit and pointing at Faye all HURR DURR IRRATIONAL WOMAN AMIRITE.  Your argument would stand if they both agreed they wanted an open relationship but they didnt  and Sven was willing to lie to Faye just so he could keep having sex with her not caring about what could happen afterwards.  He didnt care about her he didnt respect her at all he was whether you like it or not an asshole who fucked up a relationship and whos only defense was well technically I didnt lie!.  And thats like a fundamental aspect of Svens character  he is incapable of having a healthy relationship with people he hardly has friends outside of Wil and a few musician buddies he doesnt know how to respect his partners so he does hookups so he doesnt have to bother learning.  Hes selfish hes egotistic and does all his shit trying to forget about how poorly he interacts with other people.  He doesnt start growing at all until he meets Faye betrays her and then realises that what he did was cruel.  Caring about Faye postrelationship was how our Sven finally began to grow!   Thats my favourite part about the character he starts off like an asshole realises it and makes an effort to grow up and change himself and I guess retroactively thats one of the few good things to come out of this relationship they had.    Theyre all flawed people OP just like in real life but to act like Svens a misunderstood saint is serious disrespect to his character and how much progress hes made through all this time.  ,questionablecontent,citjy3u,28,t5_2rjz3

Wouldnt that be some cause for concern amongst readers?? If Claire has male genitalia many readers would start questioning Martens sexuality especially with conflicting information in the form of his vanilla porn.I highly doubt this would happen but there shouldnt be a reason to deny information about our beloved characters through anger or irritation because we asked about a characters specifics,questionablecontent,ckysll0,9,t5_2rjz3

He accepts her as she is likes to just be with her and even though his work might freak out when the higher ups find out my bet is they freak out one of them has to quit Marten knows Claires dream is to be a librarian so he quits to find a new job or inspired by his love for Clair become a punk star.

Momo decorating isnt really a plot that can extend.  Likewise Claire and Marten being adorable and hes shyed away from creating plot points from diffiuclties there relationship difficulties being easier to get plot development from than happy couples for example with Claire mentioning about being professional in the library etc that could have developped but hasnt really.

2935198,0,t1_co1pz8v,What I have noticed is that a few redditors are quite defensive about this also in another thread that brings this up. I assume its because it compares QC to CAD which as CAD is generally hated I am kinda sorta part of that crowd I used to read it for the jokes maybe like  years ago?  years? but it progressively got less and less funny and the last comics I recall had a SECOND robot somehow not sure when it was can be seen as bashing QC. I do not mean anything negative by this. This is more like a rmildlyinteresting type thing but relevant to this comic and I figured Id share my thoughts. I even made a separate post here in the subreddit because of this thread.Also I am not the only one pulling this connection. At least one more or two have mentioned the resemblance to the CAD comic titled Loss which was the metaphorical shark. Again I dont believe there was a shark jumped in QC by this well okay I kinda lost interest some  strips after the DoraMarten breakup but I still read every comic and this storyline has rekindled the interest somewhat.As for Buckleys horrible style I agree somewhat. It is unoriginal and repetitive BUT! it can be passed off as an art style or something come on there are comics made out of squares or stick figures. The main fail in CAD is the writing  the characters are shit the storylines are shit the humour is shit and the low effort put in art is just another piece of the urinal cake  shit because everything else is shit.You know this reminds me of the whole graphics vs storyline debate for video games. Then again QCs got both even though there are a few shit comics here and there oh the blasphemy!.Mona Lisa? Smiley face sticker? Sure they are different in a lot of ways but both have this character is smiling as an element just like both of the opening panels have the this character is alarmedshockedworried element. An essence of sort or a tag I dont know how to call it. As I said different people process things differently for me and . other people theres a resemblance for others maybe not. I wonder if theres another . that does see the resemblance but are in denial because hurr durr CAD sucks dont dare comparing it to QC.I am sorry if this offended anyone.,questionablecontent,co1qt5q,2,t5_2rjz3

Serial readers probably already know who is who unless its someone who doesnt show up very often and even then just being reminded about who they were when the comic first introduced them can help with that. New readers though might glance at the cast page just to see who all theyll be reading about and wouldnt want any spoilers. Thats also the reason that another comic Namesake had one character show up a few times before it was revealed who she was but even after the reveal the authors arent planning on going back and tagging those pages with her name. It would be a potential spoiler for anyone observant enough.

Then pretty soon after they broke up Tai was all about getting with Dora even feeling it was appropriate to ask Marten for advice. Again if the roles had been reversed and FayeMarten had gotten together people would be mad at them and for good reason.But on the other hand we see Tai actually being responsible and mature about this and shes literally the only person who Dora can actually talk about this stuff with since Marten Hanners and such wont really have a neutral view Hanners wants Faye to work at COD again and Marten is Marten. She literally has no other options to talk to now.

When he came to hide out with her way back one of those phases when the military was going after him she got shot and he gave her a transfusion of his blood to save her.She turned big green and fabulous and has been SheHulk ever since. Unlike her cousin she can usually control her transformations and she keeps her intelligence though she seems to lose some of her impulse control.In Sensational SheHulk she went through a number of selfaware and very enjoyable stories and along the way found out that she was a comicbook character. She actually headed off a villain once by taking a shortcut across a fake advertisement page.Nowadays she doesnt use that ability except in very rare circumstances but they love throwing in little references to itShes currently an active lawyer in the Marvel universe last I checked  she was disbarred for awhile due to author shenanigans but that got resolved. Shes a public superhero no secret identity and has an active Avengers membership.One interesting wrinkle of her powers is that where the Hulk gets stronger as he gets madder she stays the same  but her strength as SheHulk is an exponential increase from her strength as regular Jennifer Walters.

Claire has been around long enough for us to see her more clearly and yet she remains rather unlikeable because of her shallowness and similar reaction to most situations.It seems like Claire reacts to everything in a selfcentered way that usually entails a stupid little  line quip or joke that only she seems to find funny. I understand that some people may just throw me on the hatin claire bandwagon but I think Ive put into words what many people feel about her.but then again youre probably just mad because shes a transgendered person and we should all just like her.

How many people saw the growth of a character like Paige and realized that people can change that they can be better people? Hell  degrassi tackles mental illnesses in a way that most shows wouldnt touch with a twentyfoot pole. theres a lot of people out there suffering and struggling through their teen years and theres Degrassi telling them that  at least some places  its alright to be different to be gay to have dreams to have problems to cope with loss or pain or injury.
