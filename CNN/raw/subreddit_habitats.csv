655779,0,t3_1xqznk,I would use sand since Leos are a desert reptile your enclosure does look very nice but is not fitted for Leos more for a crested or day geckos more tropical lizards really. Leos need a more flat hot rockysandy environment. They will not do well in a humid one because they can get respiratory infections ,habitats,cget8my,-1,t5_2znrk

1667272,0,t3_2dgffj,Side Notes The enclosures inside dimensions are W x D x H  One thing that I dont have a photo of is the ceiling. We put in drop ceiling so that its easy to feed cords through. In order to get him used to the enclosure were just going to move his current cage inside the new one and leave the door open so he is able to walk around freely yet return to an area where he is most comfortable. That being said shelves on the inside for basking and such will be built little by little as he adjusts to his new surroundings.Plans for the inside    . Cut a hole in the floor to make a pocket for the water dish.      Put a pump inside the water dish to make water drip into it from shelf above.. Line the back wall with black bamboo.. Cover the floor with linoleum tile or wood.. Humidifier Do any fellow iggy owners know of a good humidifier to put in here?. Large live plants. Hibiscus,habitats,cjpbl1a,2,t5_2znrk
