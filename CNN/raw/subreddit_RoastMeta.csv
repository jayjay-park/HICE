5046447,0,t3_3k1h2e,Yeah a couple people showed this to us. Its bizarre she keeps talking about cyberbullies abuse and attention seeking. Its frustrating because she doesnt see the manpower the whole moderating team puts in to remove bullying comments she doesnt get the goodfaith that stop these jokes from being abusive and if she thinks jumping into a community where we laugh at ourselves is attention seeking why doesnt she kindly fuck off and leave us to it?One of her paragraphs accuses the subreddit of not being funny and you know what? Fair enough. A post that only got  votes isnt going to have devastating comments and thats a valid criticism. Everything else though is I dont like the idea of the subreddit. Fine but why did you dedicate the time to write and publish an article about a small corner of the internet you dont care about?,RoastMeta,cuuadtf,5,t5_38yub
