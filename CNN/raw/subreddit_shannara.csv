6385678,0,t1_czev9qu,No you have every right to not like the show. I dont care if you do or not to be honest. What I do care is people coming onto Terrys website  effectively his open home to his fans  and to put it politely criticizing his decisions. And beyond that most of the time calling him a sell out one of the worst things you can say to a creative human being.If you want to hate on the show fine do it to your hearts content. If you want to keep watching the show great. That helps our ratings!! But for the life of me Ill never understand the masochistic reasoning to keep watching something you loathe.  Terry doesnt get it either but he also thanks you for continuing to watch and getting our ratings higher.Also BTW the show runners arent out here looking at the things you are saying. They only care about how one person feels  Terry Brooks.  So all your ranting and screaming is ultimately for nought.,shannara,czfhfr7,-4,t5_2sncp

6704367,0,t3_47ex3p,One thing that isnt on the Terry Brooks reading order list is the WordVoid Trilogy which consists of Running With The Demon A Knight of the Word and Angel Fire East. These are like super prequels to Shannara and there is a strong connection between this trilogy and the Genesis of Shannara trilogy I wont say anymore so as not to spoil anything. The style of the WordVoid trilogy is different than the other Shannara books but it might be my favorite Shannara set and I highly recommend reading it preferably before reading either the Genesis or Legends sets.,shannara,d0csfn7,4,t5_2sncp

7849649,0,t1_d3yd6kn,Simple. Math. I dont need to do any research at all on this one. DVDs and DVD players still exist and the fact that they made DVDs for this means they looked at the economics behind it and moved forward with the business plan because they concluded that they would SELL DVDs. Therefore if you can sell DVDs they are not beyond outdated as you say because they are still making money for companies. Is the technology old? Sure. Is it beyond outdated? Economists would defy your claim...for now anyway.,shannara,d3ydc9a,2,t5_2sncp
8090219,0,t3_41hvlv,Hi thereWell I bought the books original trilogy about  years back.

Now I have started the Elfstones which has started off promising. Oh and am  have two kids a wife and work as an elementary teacher in New Zealand.,shannara,d4pexkb,2,t5_2sncp
