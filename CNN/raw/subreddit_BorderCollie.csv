72757,0,t3_1ux3h8,Ive had both breeds over the years.  To me they are practically the same kind of dog.  Smarts energy loyalty temperament and coat types.Most difference to me is colouring and body size.  Size being only slightly smaller but not by much.Hope that helps.

728615,0,t3_22e6sb,A couple of people have said that its probably not a great idea to assume the dog will have no serious problems.  I agree.  In fact I would go as far as to say that you should assume the dog will within its lifetime have at least one or two serious problems.  When I got my puppy shes a BC mix and a rescue she ended up having so many problems that needed to be fixed mange worms things that seem somewhat minor that I ended up blowing through the money I had spent a year saving up about  within the first three months.  If I hadnt saved all that money I dont know what I would have done.  Obviously this was exceptional but even though they were somewhat minor compared to an injury that needs surgery cancer or something similar they could not go untreated.  Additionally if youre getting a dog from a breeder its highly likely that youll need to get it spayed or neutered so thats an additional cost to factor in.  Anyway yes avoid making the assumption of no serious health problems.  For your sake and your future dogs sake its just always better to be extra cautious.My partner and I spend about month on our BC mix this is mostly food shes lbs and eats Solid Gold Millennia for what its worth. A lb bag lasts about two months but includes replenishing things like toothpaste treats toys etc. and set aside an additional month in savings for her annual vet visits this money also goes to heartworm and fleatick preventatives.  This creates a fund that has more money than we need for her vetting in the hopes that if something serious happens again well have the means to take care of it without hardship.  We groom her ourselves but depending on whether youre looking for a long or short haired BC and on where you live if you have the dog groomed professionally this will end up costing anywhere from  with a tip.Good luck to you!  Money is obviously something we all wish didnt have to be such an important part of owning a dog but it unfortunately is and I think its great that youre thinking about it. ,BorderCollie,cgn3i5u,1,t5_2sof5

1058500,0,t3_267gaw,I would start by teaching him a really solid leave it command. In the beginning make sure you set him up for success in the same way you did when you were teaching recall. Start small and scaffold up to something he actually wants like the squirrel. When Hubble was a young puppy he would lunge at cars and by building on the leave it command I was able to make it a non issue. You can set up challenging controlled scenarios by visiting a local pet store that has small critters and birds just make sure your pup doesnt get the opportunity to actually harass the small creatures.Even now occasionally when Hubble and I are walking  a bunny can bound by and hell get that stare... A quick leave it and he is able to understand that I do not want him to pursue.Similarly useful commands to really make solid in the case of a squirrel hungrymotion sensitive dogWatch me stay heel down comeIf you can teach him to come to you when there are all kinds of more interesting alternatives you can teach him to leave squirrels alone. Its just going to take some patience. Good luck! Hes a handsome guy!,BorderCollie,choltmf,2,t5_2sof5

That goes double if you dont have a large yard to romp about in. Border collies are pretty neurotic. Theyll literally chew windowsills fenceposts bedding etc. to pieces if there isnt anything else to do.The compulsive chewing behavior for ours did not die down until he was  or  years old. We had to crate him anytime we left for more than an hour until he was almost . Only since getting to  years has he really stopped needing to move constantly. Even now at  he is very pushy about getting his daily walk and if hes left alone indoors while Im mowing he will shred the curtains.,BorderCollie,ckzj338,1,t5_2sof5

3903098,0,t1_cr0t8sa,gtBut I never bothered with the more novelty ones that dont serve a purpose other than my own amusement.This is so untrue. Teaching dogs tricks is probably the BEST way to occupy them mentally and give them the stimulation they require. This is even more true for border collies. Learning trick is very enjoyable play time for them. The dogs gets to interact with you on a much more intimate level then just petting.Thinking that dogs need just physical exercise is so very wrong every dog but BC especially require tons of mental stimulation which includes toys liek kangs or fun treat dispensers they can learn to crack but mostly and foremostly having  you work with them. Besides tricks dont have do be you dog doing a handstand or chasing their tail. You can teach your dog to get a specific toy or teach your dog to close doors or teach your dog to clean up his toys or to not run out of your yard. Literally anything. I feel you are vastly underestimating the intellect of your dog. You can teach him anything if you put your mind to it. Even talking. Dogs are wwwaaay smarter than youd think.Another important thing about BC is that some may be fine just lounging and going on walks but many wont. Because they are such an active breed they require equal parts brain activity. And many BC that have been neglected on that front turn out neuritic depressed and just bad dogs.The last thing Id like to say is that you must realise that dogs are dogs. No matter how much youd want to feel they are like kids in the end they are dogs. They have no notion of things being humiliating. Him doing a handstand while barking The StarSpangled Banner will be just as fun to the dog as him shaking your hand. That part is in your head. So all in all OP Id advise not listening to this guy. Also Id advise not to listen to me. Read up on as many sources as you can watch as many videos as you can. Talk to experts in your shelter and local BC owners. And then... Draw your own conclusions. Theres no better way.Also as a final note.  years old is by no measure too old to start training new things. Your dog might learn slower than a puppy would but hell still learn.lastly check out kikopup and kristin crestejo on youtube. These girls know their dogs and make amazing videos. ,BorderCollie,cr16rax,4,t5_2sof5

4164111,0,t1_cruwc2p,Thanks for the advice! Im still trying to figure out how were going to execute the crate situation maybe you can weigh in? We were thinking of just keeping the crate in our bedroom and totally only crating for bedtime and away time. There are only two hours max between when I leave for work and when my husband comes home most days so that wasnt going to be a problem. Butttt there is one day a week Mondays where we are both gone am pm and for that day I was planning to leave puppy in the gated off kitchen with kong toys etc and just have a friend visitcheck inpotty time in the middle of the day. So my question is is it really dumb to leave him without his crate during this one day if thats his happy safe nap time place? Is it okay to move the crate for this one day or is that confusing for him? Im new to this whole thing and while I have nothing but time the rest of the week Im so nervousness about the best way to handle this one day with my new pup.,BorderCollie,crux20c,1,t5_2sof5

4224220,0,t3_38nbu5,Aww how sweet. I really want to bring my border collie mix to our wedding this weekend but we havent found any dog friendly accommodations in the area. Part of me is anxious because we just adopted her from a rescue last Wednesday and Im worried shell feel abandoned. But if Im honest with myself a bigger part of me is disappointed because in the week Ive had this dog shes been the best therapy Ive ever had for my anxiety issues. I now totally understand why people use animals for therapy. Her calm disposition and affection help me relax when Im wound up and her bursts of playful puppy energy force me to go out and be active a couple times a day which is a proven remedy for anxietydepression. This weekend is going to be a long one. Im sure the dog will be fine with her puppy sitter and will be used to our absence within an hour. Hopefully I adapt just as quickly. ,BorderCollie,cs1qmnp,1,t5_2sof5

Its strange too that sometimes a smaller breed can birth dogs that grow to be MUCH larger than she would ever be.....okay at my clinic...a Boston terrier and a pit....yep. the Boston carried about  half pit pups. they had to take them our surgically and they all survived. The dogs are like  lbs and the mom is about !! haha. anyway....heres some pictures Ive collected this year. Puppy shots from the foster home in Belzoni MississippiThis is CooperHollis belongs to the lady I speak with. This is MartyHal havent spoken with this dog parent but the one that I speak with does. She sent pictures of their play date shortly after adoption. This is ether Huey or Hamilton I get them confused havent spoken to this dog mom Ive only looked her up on FB and messaged her with no response....but I found a picture on her profile.The foster and I keep in contact. Shes really cool and loves to see pics and videos of Ady. She said she met the mother and she looked most like Adyline.   a little back story They are from the Yazoo area of Mississippi which is about an hour and a half northish of where I live. They were scheduled to go up north to New Hampshire I called and wanted to adopt Hilda my Adyline just before they shipped off. At first there was a problem because they were halfway spoken for but they let me get her anyway. So I was the only one who got to meet the entire litter. they were so cute! She had them all running around this HUGE yard in a country town....blah blah sorry....The rest of the litter did actually go up north and were all adopted by about  weeks. I got Ady at  weeks,BorderCollie,csgk06v,2,t5_2sof5

Poorly socialized dogs can be problematic and socializing is much easier and has a lasting effect at the early ages.  Take him to a dog park as often as possible as there will likely be dogs of all types and temperaments for him to learn from.,BorderCollie,dd5itlm,4,t5_2sof5

11311480,0,t3_61a2xt,Theres a special place in my heart for border collies. Ive had my first border collie for two years now. Raised him from a pup. He has more personality than any dog Ive ever had. When you speak to him he listens so very intently. I dont think Ive ever loved a dog more. ,BorderCollie,dfe5081,3,t5_2sof5
11318126,0,t1_dfehoxb,He has this wild butt floof that goes all the way down the back of his haunches and legs. That and his tail is long enough to braid. But I agree his lions manebeard area is so long I imagine the rest might catch up.  BCs!? You must be a saint!,BorderCollie,dfew30a,2,t5_2sof5

11545451,0,t1_dg4jk8i,gtYou use the collars for fun and training not punishment but they learn that they have to listen or they get a zap. This isnt training this is teaching your dog to fear the zap more than desire to please you. I would never recommend shock collars in this context this breed does not handle ecollars very well. gtWithout having the ability to discipline at a distance these little shits will take full advantage of you.  Im sorry but this is flat out wrong. Farmers and shepherds have used these dogs at distance for centuries that wouldnt be the case if these dogs couldnt be mindful obedient and work well at great lengths away. This is where training comes in not shock collars. You solidify the correct behaviors up close and build the distance from there. ,BorderCollie,dg4ogbs,6,t5_2sof5

Just would go lay down or sniff a patch of grass.I taught Hold by teaching him to grab the ball and hold it and get treats for it.  I worked for a month and a half and yesterday we did our first long distance retrieve outside! And a little over a month ago we were working on just fetching it a foot or two in front.Im so happy because Ive always wanted him to learn to do this.  But I worked slowly and finally got to the end result ,BorderCollie,dg6cg31,1,t5_2sof5
