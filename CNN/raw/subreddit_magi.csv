1888836,0,t3_2g87wm,You could argue that the djinn deem their masters worthy depending on who is able to beat the dungeon. The dungeons are created by the djinn. they can design it however they want so that only those who they deem worthy is able to beat the dungeon. theres a clue supporting this in adventures of sinbad. When he first entered baal he thought it was way too easy and he couldnt understand why the parthevian empire lost  soldiers in there. so maybe it was designed in a way that only sinbad or someone like him who would be compatible with baal would find easy. ,magi,ckgsolh,4,t5_2u2sx

5094397,0,t1_cuzp3j0,yeah I know but I believe they are done by a smaller company who puts out an episode every couple of month. They probably want to put as much content as they can in the episodes.,magi,cv02dfu,1,t5_2u2sx

6213754,0,t1_cyvuiop,Yes but I would like to have your opinions because I still dont understand that enough. I just wanna know what he exactly he is since at the beginning Talma Torran Arc he acted like he has own will but later  he didnt do anything to stop others David magicians from stealing his rukhmagoi he acted like he lost his will was just source of rukhmagoi.  Also later when he attacked Alma Torran he probably was controlled by David since this guy died and returned to Ill Ilah and took control.I would like to hear your opinions because this is just my theory and want know the truth since getting that from manga directly is difficult for me for few reasons.,magi,cyvxqmh,2,t5_2u2sx

6395456,0,t1_czgek8u,It probably is if I remember Sharrkan uses focalor as his household vessel and they usually gain a metal vessel that is somewhat important to them like Drakon getting baal. ,magi,czglirq,2,t5_2u2sx

8454499,0,t1_d5yb6dc,Well at first it was very awkward between them but you have to take in consideration that its been  years now. Im not saying its a good reason to move on to the point of dating though... but just saying that Aladdin doesnt hate her too much now.Also can you refresh me but is Ugo actually dead ?,magi,d5ycj07,8,t5_2u2sx

9459494,0,t3_5aat4s,So far that is all. You can watch the Sinbad spin off about  episodes. Should be on Netflix.The story is continuing in manga and a third season is likely in the future.,magi,d9f23kx,7,t5_2u2sx

9552146,0,t1_d9f4ndv,With the end of the final arc perhaps well get a new season! God I hope so. I have this sick need to have the manga adapted into an anime so that way I can just have the source of all my feels in one spot instead of having to wait for a new chapter or something. ,magi,d9qhzk4,1,t5_2u2sx
9621107,0,t3_5ce01t,Sinbad is choosing how people think and feel. For the peace of thousands of years but what is lost when everyone agrees and follows sinbads way?. Its wrong even if its for peace. I dont really get Aladdins view I feel his idea of what the world should be is vague. Solomon and Sinbad have different agendas. Sinbad had acknowledged his desire for power while Solomon didnt want to be king or God. ,magi,d9yzzlg,1,t5_2u2sx

10055179,0,t3_5jq5z1,Lets go ! The two king and their magi tag teaming hype!,magi,dbi7q50,9,t5_2u2sx
10069300,0,t1_dbjgj3q,I got the idea because they were literally talking about the very scenario that happened to Judal happening again. The reason Ugo decided to bring Scheherazade back was because she had clone bodies that were compatible with her Ego. So they could have an adult Magi back right away. Ill go back and read over it again to be sure though. But I remember them talking about losing another Magi to AlThamen like they did with Judal.Edit Here is AlThamen talking about UgoKing Solomen reviving Scheherazade because of the risk that they would kidnap another infant magi.here and hereHow were they slaves though? The magis main role is to basically choose a candidate that they think would be suitable to be the new king of the world? Or at the very least king of some amount of territory. And that role is something they can willingly choose not to fulfill. Yunan gave up searching for a king candidate a long time ago. Preferring instead to travel around the world and mainly guard the Great Canyon. Scheherazade initially chose a candidate in Reim but after he died she never chose a new one. She simply supported the country itself rather than any of the new leaders. She became a defacto ruler of Reim herself. And then there is Judal the only one of the original three Magi from the new world Aladdin is technically from Alma Torran who is actually going about choosing candidates. And yet he fell into depravity and his rukh broke from the Great FlowSolomons will. ,magi,dbk1wed,2,t5_2u2sx

10140205,0,t1_dbt7g80,What Sinbad is doing is forcing his views on everyone.  In the latest chapter you see Morgiana chained more than when she was a slave.    ,magi,dbt9u9p,1,t5_2u2sx
10149396,0,t3_5l1fhq,I disagree I think the pacing has been pretty good. You talk about the final arc taking  chapters and I flashback to the war arc of Naruto. There were some great parts of that but there were also a lot of extraneous fights and characters that did not need to be there. As long as Ohtaka doesnt get rushed into wrapping everything up in a couple of chapters like Kubo did I think well be fine.    ,magi,dbugvti,4,t5_2u2sx
10156950,0,t1_dbsau6d,gt And also at the very least the ending couldnt possibly be worse than the ending to rbleach.and in turn cant be worse like the Gantz series...,magi,dbvchp0,1,t5_2u2sx
10382576,0,t1_dckpw88,I agree something sad will likely happen but I dont see Aladdin getting sealed away to take the place of Ugo. Reason being their goal isnt to stop Sinbad and rewrite the will theyre going there to completely destroy the sacred palace and the ruhk system as it exists now. If they destroy the sacred palace theyll have no need for anyone to stay there because well it wont exist. I still wonder what that will mean for everyone in the sacred palace but yeah.,magi,dckxgmr,3,t5_2u2sx
10976847,0,t1_dec4vdq,thanks a lot !I will do that.Thank you for your time and help,magi,dec7lqg,2,t5_2u2sx
11232996,0,t1_df54gv7,It should be. I mean Im not sure where it could go from here unless they do the Dragonball Super route of exploring a greater multiverse. Which Sinbad apparently wants to do so hey. ,magi,df58ttp,3,t5_2u2sx
