1883263,0,t3_2g66wy,We lived for over a decade in west Fay  Jack Britt district.  Finally couldnt take the crime or the city shenanigans anymore and bought a new home a little over a year ago between Bragg and Vass.  One of the best decisions weve made.  Theres Woodlake which is in Moore county just east of Vass. While I dont live in Woodlake I live near it and can vouch for how nice the area is.  My little itty bitty subdivision is just a few miles away about  mins from the Long Street gate and our builder is now maxed out at  houses and landlocked by woods and farmland that wont ever be developed.  Being so small and private we might as well be gated. Its fantastic!  Then theres Anderson Creek east of Hwy  in Harnett county.   I have friends who live in Carolina Lakes and thats a really nice community but way too many houses for us.  Buffalo Lake Road has seen some crime lately too.  Carolina Trace looks nice and Im sure it is.  Might be a hike to Bragg but I know a lot of people are moving out that way.     Hope this helps  ,Fayettenam,ckg4j3j,2,t5_2se9h

5453488,0,t1_cw880m9,Dr Barbaro is hands down the BEST dentist Ive ever been to aside from my grandfather. His chair side manner is extremely polite and caring. Although I get a little apprehensive when i go to the dentist I like going to Dr. Barbaro.,Fayettenam,cw8qh5s,2,t5_2se9h

Just by having a drivers license it opens up the door for employment opportunities. ,Fayettenam,dccvej2,0,t5_2se9h
