176707,1,t3_1vy8kg,Im still in the process of reading this and Im enjoying it so far.  One thing thats really impressing me in the writing is the commitment to the language of the time.  Careys done a great job writing in a consistent antiquated voice without sacrificing readability which isnt something I see very often even in good period fantasy novels.  It mustve taken forever to hone this semiarchaic writing style but I think its paying off and just sucks me into the story that much more.,Fantasy_Bookclub,ceyk7s4,0,t5_2s92h
452107,0,t3_1yasoe,I didnt mind The Blacksmiths Son. I would definately class it as a light read but engrossing all the same and for a ridiculously low price if you own a Kindle.,Fantasy_Bookclub,cfrniu7,1,t5_2s92h

3108431,0,t3_2l7ise,In chronological order starting from year . there are too many other series to name prior to thatA Song of Ice and Fire by George Martin except for the th book..  that one had too many boring chaptersThe Prince of Nothing by R. Scott BakkerThe Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrich RothfussThe Broken Empire by Mark Lawrence still reading halfway through book All of those are such page turners I was just unable to put them down. ,Fantasy_Bookclub,cok6rim,1,t5_2s92h
5052285,0,t3_3k5jdh,The American roadtrip was sort of what Neil Gaiman was trying to write about in part. That aspect of the book wont go away. Also American Gods is sort of more literary than your standard fantasy read. I liked it but I know many who didnt. Its just a matter of taste. I know people who felt like the book was a letdown. It may just no be your thing.Have you read any of his other work? There might be better entry points for you if youre not familiar with his work. Other books of his are quite different.,Fantasy_Bookclub,cuuzpuv,2,t5_2s92h

6923513,0,t1_d111t8b,I hope its just as good. Or maybe more books in the series. I loved the gritty feel. And one if the things I like about some fantasy novels are how the gods take more of a hand or when they pose as people. Theyre not just some formless name the characters call upon that doesnt give a crap. ,Fantasy_Bookclub,d113rsb,2,t5_2s92h
6985383,0,t1_d17stix,Haha thats funny. Maybe Ill do a quick skim read of the first two then I put book  in the togotocharityshop pile but if mum hasnt taken them Ill fish it out but thats good to know.Thanks  Someone else in person told me they thought Faith of the Fallen was the best but I wasnt enamoured by that one I remember reading that one quickly because I wanted to get through it haha.,Fantasy_Bookclub,d184t7d,1,t5_2s92h

8752082,0,t3_4zu37d,Everything by Larry Correia! Monster Hunter International is fun action packed urban fantasy. Grimnoir Chronicles series is like s alternate history where some people have xmen style powers. Son of the Black Sword is the start of a unique epic fantasy series. Seriously check them all out. He is still pretty unknown and a new author but I read every book he puts out as quickly as possible and Im always so impressed!,Fantasy_Bookclub,d6zo14z,1,t5_2s92h

11227280,0,t3_602fxy,I think you could definitely classify these books as fantasy. I enjoyed the first book it was something fun you could easily escape into. I however gave up on the second pretty quickly. I wanted to read something that wasnt so focused on romance. ,Fantasy_Bookclub,df4litp,1,t5_2s92h
