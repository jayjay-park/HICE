10487592,0,t3_5eles8, year old reader here. Been reading since I was  and proud of it  never thought when I grabbed Midnight that I would be addicted to the entire series almost  years later!I personally dont understand why no one seems to like Dawn of the Clans. I find it so refreshing to leave all those dozens of characters behind for a few new ones. I respect that you have a different opinion of course  but it kind of saddens me that because DotC is different hardly anyone likes it. I thought it had an interesting story and such a bittersweet ending. Moth Flights Vision was a tearjerker as well. Maybe Im too addicted lolThis was amazingly written though. I have to say that I think Alderpaw failing was a good thing. In life you dont always succeed and so far almost every single main character has fulfilled their prophecy. I think they made him fail more than just to keep the SkyClan cats whereabouts a mystery and bring in new villains. I think it was to add more to the story that is Warriors.You also pointed out things that I noticed myself but that didnt really click in my head. Hawkwing has lost almost everything he cares about. He still has SkyClan and he can still overlook the development of Plumwillows kits. But he has nothing personal to him left. No family. No apprentices.I think Im about to cry again lol you should review warriors books more often. Youre great at it!,WarriorCats,dcwvmbt,2,t5_2tn9g
