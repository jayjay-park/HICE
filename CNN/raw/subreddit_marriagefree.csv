1905703,0,t3_2gfsfz,I do not plan on getting married because to me marriage will not bring any benefits to my life. If I love the person and I choose to share myself and my life with them in my opinion that is perfect. To me a contract and a piece of jewelry does not make a relationship stronger and find people who require this to be needy insecure people. I believe another human is not yours and find married people to act as though their partners are a property. I cannot promise a feeling no matter how much I would love to. ,marriagefree,ckitpvl,3,t5_2v1nh
4044098,0,t1_crgnegg, so much this. A friend of mine got engaged and spent the whole rest of that day driving around without him to friends and family and even her work to show off the ring it made me feel so bad for him like he didnt matter at all just the fact that she landed her a man. ,marriagefree,crh9amk,2,t5_2v1nh
4198966,0,t1_cryue5z,I have had the opposite experience. When my SO and I travel on a whim and do spontaneous things which we do often some of our married friends with kids make jealous comments about how they wish they could do that. A few years ago we moved to the beach and took the summer off of work and some friends actually seemed mad at us because it would never be an option for them.I have never felt jealous or regret when most of my friends got married and had kids. I felt relieved. I still have plenty of purpose in my life without kids or marriage. Maybe that is how OP will feel when in hisher s instead of jealousy and regret.Edit I just realized domino must have been using sarcasm here. I missed it. I have been recovering from surgery and am a little medicated. It must be sarcasm.,marriagefree,cryvkta,2,t5_2v1nh
4273935,0,t3_39tznu,Ha! Saw that too you beat me to it!Yes I get sooo tired of people talking about their weddings.  I have a very good friend who talked about her wedding for ages until it happened then now that she is getting divorced thats all she talks about.  But she is a super good friend so I dont resent it too much...,marriagefree,cs7e2ct,1,t5_2v1nh

4580110,0,t1_ct7ksds,I second this. Maybe also mention that youd love to take her and her new husband out to dinner or something similar when theyre back as your way of congratulating them and still supporting her on what she considers her big day. ,marriagefree,ct7xdv8,2,t5_2v1nh

5004096,0,t3_3jb2dm,Personally Im not worried about being in the majority and I seriously doubt anyone who is MF cares about it either.   I simply enjoy all the benefits of being MF.  Whether or not other people have issues with the MF choice is irrelevant to me anyway.,marriagefree,cup6iyx,2,t5_2v1nh
8179275,0,t1_d4zfy1c,My opinion is that I dont think  years is enough time to really know if youre going to last with someone but I do know that everyone is different and some people can make it work! I know personally that being so young early s amp still living with my parents that once I do move out it will not be with my SO. Maybe eventually in my s when I have actual experience living on my own and feel confident that I know how to  support myself. I do hope that they make it work for the long haul too and that if they dont that at least the split will be amicable. ,marriagefree,d4zyiod,5,t5_2v1nh
9543935,0,t3_5b0tkb,Over and over Ive seen peoples lives being destroyed because of this bullshit called marriage. It is a prison.Totally agree on this.  My ex was one of those clean my house cook my meals types although he didnt show that side of him until shortly after we got married.   Going through the divorce crusher was tough but for me definitely worth it.   Ill be keeping my singlehood freedom from now on no matter how many people keep telling me I made a mistake.  Uh no the mistake was getting married in the first place.  The divorce was my way of fixing that mistake and getting my freedom back.  ,marriagefree,d9phk9m,4,t5_2v1nh
9728995,0,t1_dabugfv,Having any kids at all is a challenge!lol  OH yeah.  And the challenge starts with pregnancy and birth especially for women who may turn out to have difficult experiences with both as I did.  And if you decide to have kids it should be because you truly want to not because someone is pressuring you!Absolutely.  I have always thought its a bad idea to have a child ONLY to please someone else like a partner inlaws or immediate family.  If a woman really doesnt want children and many prefer to remain childfree  shes better off not dating a guy who either wants to have kids one day or is childlessundecided now but may change his mind and want kids a few years later.  ,marriagefree,dacb7z6,2,t5_2v1nh
10009378,0,t3_5izo6p,To answer the thread question plenty.  Mostly because its none of anyones business what another couple does.   If some nosy parker told me I should stay married when I was in the process of divorcing my response to that person would have been less than polite.  ,marriagefree,dbc91d0,8,t5_2v1nh
