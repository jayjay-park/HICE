2857692,0,t3_2ssj49,Contrast is high because the contrast of the scene itself is high.  Exposure is low if anything.  The subjects are the dogs and we are lacking detail on the two main black ones due to the low exposure. If this was shot in raw you could do quite a bit of work with curves to bring up the dogs while treating the snow separately up my recommendation or down to lower the contrast.If you want to talk about metering we need to know what camera you were using and what metering mode you were in.,ColumbusPhotography,cnsx4sa,1,t5_35swy
