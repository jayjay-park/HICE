Big cities tend to have police officers out standing on the street corners.Ive never been to NY or London but most of the other European cities Ive been to there havent been.gt Cuba has conscription. Everyone  years old must complete two years of military service which can include service in the Polica Nacional Revolucionaria PNR. After the service some may stay on or go elsewhere.So does Israel. Conscription in Denmark and I guess for most of Europe is only for men.gt There are enough tourists in Cuba to easily blend in and not be bothered. Not true. Ive been in Havana for a total of  days and have walked on Obispo every time. I was stopped a total of  times each time.

The ones that hate Castro the ones that love him and the ones that dont care. So media portrayal is going to vary according to this. How to spot the difference? The ones that sound North Koreaish and praise Castro as if he were an all encompassing saint are self evident.The ones who hate him are as well.The ones who dont car are a toss up they can go either way in reporting on Cuba.Find your truth in the middle. Dont blindly believe what any one source tells you.gt How good is the economy doing? Is it moving at a stable growth rate and will be sustainable in the future.This is a seriously hard question for anyone to answer. If you visit Cuba and go into the streets you will find that the economy sucks. People are not visibly going hungry yet very few are actually working and have very little money. So where does the food come from? Theft or farms.In the hotels food is stolen like its going out of style. That is the real reason why there is food for the majority of the people to eat. Also why youll find subpar pizzas missing half their cheese and a general lack of ingredients in every state run hotel or restaurant. Workers steal pretty much everything that is not bolted down.The government generally turns a blind eye to the thefts but has to prosecute people for it so as not to lose respect so they every once in a while will catch and prosecute a bunch of people. gt Also how do the citizens there view the government and its leadersalso is there any personality cult built around Castro or Guvera like ertswhile Soviet Union.This one is a rather funny answer to a serious question. Officially there is no personality cult. But you can find pictures of Castro on just about every wall in Cuba. So ita a matter of lets not and say we did. No personality cult here! Dont mind all the pictures of castro.Nobody Ive ever met gives three fuckas about Che Guevara except when the need arises to parrot the Che propaganda in front of some political group or person. We must all look like were willingly following the official line. This mainly is what makes Cubans such perfect two faced liars. Its been forced on them since birth. Play the part look the part youre good. Slip youre fucked.gt How possible is dissent there? There is a state run newspaper if I am correct Cuba ranked low in journalistic freedom. What is your view of this?Dissent is as possible there as it would be in the US. The US does not allow for political prisoners because they are a Democracy. How can you have political prisoners when this is a democracy? So Cuba put in elections and forces people to vote now were a democracy! So political prisoners a thing of the past. Why? Simple In the US you have laws that make specific things illegal. Everything not outlawed is considered legal. In Cuba it is sort of a reversal of this. Everything not specifically allowed by law is illegal. Yes there are laws that specifically forbid certain things but many laws have to allow things its really a very fixed game where the state never loses. Having a zillion reasons to put anyone in jail it becomes childs play to imprison any dissenter as a criminal and call it a day. Stealing food comes to mind as a very real example. gt Finally what is your opinion of Guveras commodificationhis image on T shirts are a big sell in most parts of the world kinda ironical considering he was extremely critical of the system. Personally? I see Che as an idiot play piece exploited by Fidel. After he took power he cleansed his group of everyone he thought could compete with his popularity or power. Camilo and Che to name a couple. Che was a stupid idealist who really thought he had the answers. An idiot. So yeah he ordered the deaths of thousands. All in the name of his ideals. You know much like the Catholic church did during the inquisition. Yet surprisingly here you have two instances where neither party is generally blamed or accused of such atrocities. Yet Hitler is hated for the holocaust undeniably so but my point is that all three are responsible for mass deaths yet it seems like in order to forgive some and condemn the others the number of deaths are the main score not the fact that when you murder people you are a murderer one murder should be too many.The Castros are responsible for thousands of deaths directly and an insurmountable count of deaths indirectly. Yet they seem to have evaded all justice by simply being expert manipulators of the press. So to cut this off at the roots media is a result of what these media companies believe people want to hear and distort this information in order to further whatever agenda they may have. Dont trust the media hell dont even trust what I say if it doesnt resonate within your parameters of truth.,cuba,daexvhw,4,t5_2r74v

10261502,0,t1_dc757gi,no it was cuc total for the cab drive from Havana to varadero for me and my bf and our luggage.but youll do well if you keep that in mind and ask your driver if his price is each person or in total. There are sooooooooooo many taxi drivers in Havana that if you hear a bad price from one guy dont hesitate to say no gracias and move on to another taxi driver who can offer a better price.its hard to get the hang of it as a firsttimer in Cuba but youll catch on quick! Its good to know prices beforehand like youre doing now,cuba,dc773xh,1,t5_2r74v
10297084,0,t1_dcb5pmh,Ohh Im sorry. Take taxi collectivos. Ask your casa particular to schedule it. Should be around  to go to each city. Or you can just go to the bus station in any city and they will be waiting,cuba,dcb8at7,1,t5_2r74v

Great tour since just the bus alone would have cost cuc I think. We will do Trinidad and Santiago on our next trip. I would personally skip Vedado as the Tropicoco beach is awesome for day trips.,cuba,dcqlwxs,2,t5_2r74v

I just got back from Cuba and rented a car driving from Havana to play giron to Trinidad and back to Havana with stops in cienfuegos and driving in the mountains I rented a Renault Sandero Automatic and had a blast driving it over  kilometers even though I did it on a spare tire the whole time. I was quite nervous before hand but it was too bad. Normally I drive in the Bronx and had more trouble driving in Montenegro than Cuba. If you have any questions please feel free to ask.,cuba,dfw68sc,1,t5_2r74v
