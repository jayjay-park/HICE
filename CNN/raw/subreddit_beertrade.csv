Youre not from the area youre clearly just trying to run down the value of the beer.Trading oz for oz is hardly a fair ratio seeing as both beers have demand way higher than supply and have s on BA.

I asked him when Mikkeller was going to start brewing at the old AleSmith and he said they were just waiting for the license.  Theres a big backlog because there are . breweries applying for licenses every day.  Good numbers for you!Im sure youve considered this already but my internet two cents if youd have it is not to close any doors by aiming for only the big guns.  Brewpubs restabrews are great places to start.  Also keep an ear out for breweries that are expanding.  They open up tons of jobs when they do.GL!,beertrade,ctbtg98,5,t5_2rgco

Im in The Triangle area and Ive been dying to find Hop Drop until a couple managers told me they wont be getting any for awhile for the above reason. Really sucks cause I love Hop Drop as well.

11567354,0,t3_651z6t,Just something local that isnt accessable anybody outside the distribution thats somewhat highly regarded or you think is worth someone trying but easy to obtain and holds little to no trade value. Or if you feel like youre getting a steal you can throw in some nice extra to round out a trade. Either way ALWAYS send extras and dont expect any in return.,beertrade,dg75y7k,5,t5_2rgco

11638289,0,t1_dgf5tuv, seems OK for THOH Hops with higher allotments.  Id think  a reg Veil offering would be a more equitable trade but PBO has been trending up.The down votes are likely a result of these veil cans were a pain to get.  Folks likely take exception to this since we all inconvenience ourselves to get beers. Good luck! ,beertrade,dgf7on1,4,t5_2rgco
