9886527,0,t1_davi2d2,It might be a cool idea to have opening crawls at the start of each week or whatever to keep people up to date on developments.  Just a few paragraphs in the Star Wars style of course recapping recent events.  We could even take turns at writing them.  For exampleA long time ago in a galaxy far far away...It is a time of political unrest.  Senator Cairns of Corellia and Senator Janson of Bespin have formed an uneasy alliance against the trade deal proposed by Senator Svoosch of Trandosha.Meanwhile Senators Antilles of Alderaan and Yarua of Kasshyk have proposed a bill granting the Jedi Council greater military control over the Republic and have moved to dispatch Master Damarch to Huttcontrolled Tatooine to create local support for the Senate.With mere hours before the Senate vote on Senator Svooschs trade proposal Senator Janson takes the floor...,galactic_senate,daw8k9p,2,t5_3hveh

9960425,0,t3_5i3v0m,Senator Zherron. I find your devotion to your people and your willingness to do whatever it takes to protect them to be a very honorable trait. As Im sure you are aware the Mandalorian people feel strongly about their cultural identity and have great respect for anyone who feels the same. In fact that is why I remain so uneasy about Senator Neemars centralist view on the Republic. The way I see it planets like Dantooine and Mandalore and Onderon and Mon Cala are first and foremost their own entity and their place in the Republic is second to that. Neemars desire to grow the control of the government and back it up with the strength of a standing army all in the name of security only serves to risk our own cultural individualities in the name of the collective. I should fear what would happen if a planet opposed him... Take a planet such as yours. What would happen if Neemar should decide it was best for the collective to take food from your people without fair compensation. As you said yourself the people of Dantooine would be defenseless against his army. But I digress... Yes senator. I respect you and your people. I respect the cultural heritage and in turn the territory of Dantooine. If it there were to ever be an invasion or blockade of that territory the people of Mandalore will be at your side. You have my word.,galactic_senate,db5vatv,1,t5_3hveh
