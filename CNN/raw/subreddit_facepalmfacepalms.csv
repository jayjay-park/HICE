493942,0,t3_1qfvhw,True this one is probably a joke. But in all honesty people really are that stupid. Source I work an IT Help Desk. Trouble tickets that I have had called in just a fewOur power is out  is that why the computers wont come on?I cant get out of google. I need to be in internet explorer but I cant get out of google.  Luser was already IN Internet Explorer on Google.comI keep trying to get to the internet and this box keeps coming up. The box was the web browser. They would start the browser then close the box repeatedly. I have no idea what the logic was behind this  showed them how to enter an address and closed the ticket. Not saying this is real  just that some people really are as stupid as all that.Edit formatting,facepalmfacepalms,cfweydq,2,t5_2vaak
