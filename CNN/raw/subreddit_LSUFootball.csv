1322593,0,t3_297soy,Problem with those offenses is that NFL GMs know that is why the players put up big numbers. LSUs pro style offense would be better to show NFL GMs you are NFL ready.,LSUFootball,ciiepvz,3,t5_2s5kg

1659630,0,t3_2db8hl,Magee looks pretty good in the few blips he has in this video. Otherwise its semidisheartening to realize that practically the rest of the clip are highlights of players who left us for the NFL. Time for the youngins to fill out the new highlight reels! ,LSUFootball,cjocxoz,2,t5_2s5kg

2004242,0,t3_2hny6r,Harris looked really good but it was just New Mexico state.  If he does it again next week he deserves the starter spot. I think Jennings biggest problem is he couldnt step on the field without getting booed last night. Not only was that completely unnecessary  it had to kill his confidence.  I thought our fans were better than that.,LSUFootball,ckupjz6,3,t5_2s5kg

2053206,0,t1_cl0sxmb,Yeah espn made a good point. True freshmen at rb and qb? Prolly not gonna be a just great year but that would hopefully mean next year will be awesome.,LSUFootball,cl0t3ea,4,t5_2s5kg
2070343,0,t1_cl2xp7j,Very true. I dont think itll happen and what you said is true.I would love to see Bryles come and run the spread though. However the chance of that is miniscule,LSUFootball,cl2zif3,1,t5_2s5kg
2183168,0,t3_2k2ajo,I hope he does well. I live in Houston and am a Texans fan but Im really pulling for Mett. I wanna see him succeed in the NFL.,LSUFootball,clhc0wt,8,t5_2s5kg

5287890,0,t1_cvne6sh,Youd think. But shit like this happens every year. I dont get it really. We always play down to cupcake teams its so stupid.,LSUFootball,cvnl98h,2,t5_2s5kg
5402787,0,t3_3p10tn,Try to get some good CajunCreole food. Jambalaya some crawfish dishes ask around. Louisiana consistently ranks as one of the happiest states and I think the food is a big part of that.On a side note I dont know if youd be interested since youre a Florida fan but lots of tourists like to try gator. Ive actually never had it but they all seemed to like it. ,LSUFootball,cw29kzb,3,t5_2s5kg
