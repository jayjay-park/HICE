2620526,0,t1_cn0csxp,I havent driven the speed so I cant compare. When the speed is warm most shifts higher gears are very smooth and the ride is awesome in general. Thats it though. Lower gear downshifts are terrible. When its cold it shifts all gears pretty hard. I have not heard any complaints myself besides about the fuel economy for the speed.,Charger,cn0n2sz,1,t5_2vox2
2727920,0,t3_2raa4a,Thanks for the appreciation! A mini review on the changes this has from previous gens New front end with new drl leds new rear end with new leds updated interior. New?  speed for the v. I got the rt plus so it came with leather heated seats and paddle shifters. The steering really sharpens up on sports mode and it bangs through gears really aggressively. The paddles also shift gears  dam quick for a torque converter. I wonder how much better the track version is this is my first charger. Im coming from a wrx so I will do some mods to this hemi.

3299116,0,t3_2wvfd5,see my post i found a fix for your whining noise. My cars in the shop as we speak getting the fix. The pdf in my post shows the problem and solution.sorry for spamming but id hate to see you guys run out of your warranty in time to fix this issue. Mine expired as of this month and i knew the days were getting warmer to the point that i would have to wait the next year to get it fixed. If that happened they wouldnt have included this fix as part of the warranty.,Charger,cp4bqgc,1,t5_2vox2

4796194,0,t3_3gi9yr,I have been looking into doing the same to my  rt awd.  Best I could find that someone has done before is an Edelbrock I could not find any other reference where someone has tried a different supercharger in an awd model. Heres the link where the guy talks about installing it in his  and all the steps involved.  I have also been told a stronger transfer case would be a good idea but have also read that hp should be fine in the current model. Please let me know anything you find out because Id really like to make this happen too!!,Charger,ctz3ktk,1,t5_2vox2

6159075,0,t3_3zcle7,Those Scat Packs are overpriced.  For k from a reputable Mopar shop you can get much more for that money... especially if you step up to Stage  where the cost is about K plus install.You can literally get a moderatelybuilt stroker for that cost.,Charger,cypq1nh,1,t5_2vox2
6455440,0,t3_4405z5,Hey there twin of mineThe Hemi Tick is something you should keep an ear open for. Do some research and learn what the normal tick sounds like sewing machine and what abnormal tick sounds like clattering tapping knocking. I ended up getting a new short block because the cam apparently walked itself slightly out of center enough to cause some harsh lifter tap when cold and the cam was unable to be extracted for replacement. I had very minor coolant leaks out of the water pump area. One was the air bleeder screw and the other was the coolant temperature sensor. The factory pipe dope they use on the threads seems to bake itself rock hard and brittle after a while. Cleaning up the threads and the use of teflon tape on the threads of both stopped those issues.Those have been my only real issues with the vehicle after dailying it for a year and a half. Its now a weekend car and I still love her as much as I did on day one. This past summer I put a Zoomers catback on mine see here and it really brings the sound to life. I wish I had done it sooner. It felt like driving a new vehicle.In terms of maintenance the most important will be to stay on top of your oil changes. Use OEM filters and Pennzoil or Mobil  W Synthetic. Congrats on the purchase! Hopefully your experience will be a little less troublesome than mine in the beginning. ,Charger,czn19u1,3,t5_2vox2
