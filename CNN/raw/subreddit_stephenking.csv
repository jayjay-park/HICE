382557,0,t1_cfke0e2,Oh yeah when he put himself into the story that was it for me. I know he has this whole reason for doing it but its still lousy storytelling. I think I made it about halfway into  most of it read with a look of disbelief on my face. I literally stopped reading and went and sold  and  at a used bookstore because I was just stunned by how terrible it was. I hear that  is better and maybe I should give it a go but from what Ive heard it still isnt anywhere near as solid as I wish it was. A fucking spiderbaby named MORDRED?? Thats just ridiculous...Its really weird actually to be such a huge fan of someone and yet to hate their new work. Ive read everything SK wrote before about  except The Plant and a couple other super rare works and I really enjoyed most of them. The Shining is honestly one of the best pieces of popular literature Ive ever read and so many of his other works are deeply engaging.

867286,0,t3_238caa,This scene has always boggled my mind as well. I think that Stephen King insisted on this scene because there is a connection between the feeling humans have during orgasm and the realm in which the interdimensional beings It and The Turtle inhabit. Stephen mentions that the only time people touch this realm is in the midst of ecstasy. So since It had fled and The Turtle had gone to sleep the children had lost that connection to the interdimensional realm that had before hand given Eddy the power to know which way to go. By having sex the again touched the realm and regained there power temporarily. ,stephenking,ch2v5qd,3,t5_2rce8

Now Rolands world  MidWorld ya ken  is not the same as our world but it rhymes more or less. So the Topeka where the katet ended up its not the same as our Topeka. But theres something else at work here something more sinister. As our katet gain their bearings after exiting Blaine the pain they find that Topeka Rolands Topeka the Topeka of MidWorld  has been taken over by a thinny. A thinny is a patch where the world has worn thin where the boundary between this world and the world next door has started to become indistinct.Because of the thinny parts of MidWorlds Topeka have started to blur into another Topeka. Not our Topeka but an adjacent Topeka. The Topeka where Captain Trips burned through and took everybody with it. Thats why the Topeka in which our katet find themselves is deserted. Its cause everybody done landed bootsup or else hightailed it to parts west say thankya.Our katet have no intention of lingering in this bad place this thin place. Now that theyre well and truly done with Blaine they have little difficulty finding their way back to the Path of the Beam Shardiks Beam the Bear Beam the Beam they first found themselves on all the way back before Lud and the unpleasantness within. It turns out that a road out of Topeka leads that way a thin version of the Kansas Turnpike. So they plant their boots on it  and moccasins and wheels and paws and head southeast always southeast bird and bear and hare and fish all things serve the Beam.They dont make it very far before its time to hunker down for the night. They make their rude camp in the middle of the highway its not like theres any traffic to run them down do ya ken  and once theyd et and set it came time for a story. And not just any story. A story long time coming and long time in the telling. A story Roland needed to tell and the tet needed to hear.The story began long ago. How long? Difficult to say. Times been slippery since the world moved on. Ten years at least. Ten thousand? A distinct possibility. Roland was a boy just fourteen back in Gilead. Hed completed his test of manhood and in the process painted a giant red target on his back and waved it in front of Marten the court magician. His father knew that a confrontation between Marten and the boy would be fatal for more than just his son so he concocted a pretense. He sent his son and his sons two closest friends  Cuthbert and Alain  east to the barony of Mejis the isolated town of Hambry on a mission for the Affiliation. They were there to take a census and to stay out of trouble.And it was there that naturally enough Rolands ka guaranteed that he should find trouble almost immediately by putting him in the path of Susan Delgado a flaxenhaired silvereyed maiden barely older than himself. That night when Roland met Susan beneath the Kissing Moon would be the first domino to fall of that long and fateful season but it wouldnt be the last not nearly.The last would be the one that kicks Roland hard in the backside sending him southeast along the path of the Beam.Toward the Tower.,stephenking,chou28i,18,t5_2rce8

Thats why there are books scattered about in every episode. The only valid thought above is the character of the Man In Black which Lost creators already have said is a nod to Dark Tower. The rest you mentioned is just vague coincidence.

Under the Dome is a huge undertaking that is part mystery part thriller with some humans are the real evil horror elements.  Doctor Sleep is a sequel to The Shining though its not necessary to read The Shining first the end wont make as much sense.  Cell is a straight up horror novel basically like a zombie apocalypse book.  Of the five this is probably the quickest read.  Just After Sunset is a short story collection.  ,stephenking,cqz76nd,1,t5_2rce8

I like to take little breaks between books sometimes helps clear my mindIt seems to me that King puts himself into stories quite often as a character just in different versions of reality. I liked how this one played out with him not really even trying to pretend that the main character was anything other than an alternate reality version of himself.

I think thats why his books and stories resonate with so many people on so many different levels.

Thats a huge bonus for an actor and whether or not you liked him in Breaking Bad Jesse Pinkman and Eddie Dean have a lot in common and I think Aaron Paul is a decent enough actor to reflect the maturecomplex nature of Eddie Dean and his transition and growth. ,stephenking,czlap26,1,t5_2rce8

The most gunslingerlike group we see outside of the DT is the group that confronts Flagg in the Stand  none of whom use weapons. Glen mentions they are being hollowed out for use in whatever plan god has. This fits with your idea of the TowerWhite affecting people. The gunslinger training  which either destroys you or makes you into a killer with a narrow focus  hollows the gunslingers out to the point they can be affected.

7278430,0,t1_d25hxd5,Pushing it in the direction of a traditional horror flick is just asking for it to fail though. One of the unique things about the original book is that its so different than most horror stories and giving it to a studio thats just going to turn it into another regular horror film for a quick cash grab makes me not excited about it at all. Theyre also supposedly updating it to take place farther in the future than the original. Why change something thats such a masterpiece on its own? If the story is good enough it doesnt need to be updated or conformed to the modern idea of what a horror movie should be. Ill reserve judgment until I see the end product but nothing Ive heard about the development thus far makes me confident the final result wont be a huge disappointment to those of us who love the original so much. ,stephenking,d25ibxb,3,t5_2rce8

9190373,0,t1_d8ggmrb,Pet Sematary no doubt!!! I just finished up my annual October re read of it and it works great for the season. Or you could read the  short stories from Night Shift that deal with Salems Lot. They are called Jerusalems Lot and One For The Road. Actually that entire book of short stories would be a great October read. So would The Mist from Skeletons Crew and  from Full Dark No Stars.Or you could tackle Geralds Game which has a little connection with Dolores Claiborne. Under The Dome is another fun Fall read and it takes place during FallOctober but its quite long. Bag Of Bones would also be pretty fun around this time of year. Damn Im sorry I loaded ya down!

9489984,0,t3_5arshk,I think its less about an act of reaching towards adulthood and more about reaching towards life through sex.I believe they do think that IT is dead but they have lingering doubts.  They are trying to escape the maze of ITs liar the greater sewers and they have to make a real substantial act to rebind themselves to each other in order to reach towards the light.  From my relatively recent rereading their katet was fraying with some of them having doubts about IT being dead others sure of it etc.  They had to rebind themselves in some way that wasnt necessarily about IT but more about their group itself just enough to climb out of the darkness.I think someone had pointed out that Stan possibly didnt climax and thats a hint on him being in some ways out of the katet when they needed to come back to Derry.The theme of leaving childhood behind and becoming adults is a complicated one also and there is some of it there.  Theres some of it in that scene as well as never playing in the Barrens again.  But they dont fully leave their childhoods behind until they really kill IT and you see the symbols of the childhood being destroyed in the flood and storm Derry being wrecked being the most obvious as well as more subtly the glass walkway between the children and adult library buildings being destroyed and never rebuilt.,stephenking,d9iudib,4,t5_2rce8

9578587,0,t1_d9tp08t,Its even worse than that. I live in NY. I remember the absolutely vile things he said to the press when the central park five were proven to be innocent. Basically saying that they were guilty even though they had been proven innocent simply because they were black. The smear campaigns he ran against Ivana and then Marla while he was divorcing them. The very public meltdowns aimed towards anyone who didnt agree that he is as great as he thinks he is. Calling Rosie ODonnell a pig. How many times has he gone bankrupt? Putting people out of their homes over in Scotland. Putting people out of their homes here. The man would rob a he less person and gleefully run away laughing if given the chance. Then when caught he would say that the homeless person is probably collecting public assistance and living off the taxes he pays so he deserves that change he just stole because that homeless guy should get a job. Would he offer him a job at one of his many businesses? No. He is a caricature of the typical slovenly greedy immoral rich person you see in political cartoons. Yet the system screwed up so bad that he is going to become the next president of the United States. The founders of this country would spit on someone like him.Lets never forget that in the year  we elected a man who feels that the proper way to woo a woman is to grab her by the pussy. A man who swore that several innocent black teenagers should stay in jail for a crime they did not commit simply because they were black and were therefore going to do something illegal anyway.

9872760,0,t1_dau9q21,The first book The Gunslinger is far from my favourite in the series but its also the shortest so if you dont like it much at least you can get it out of the way quickly enough. It gets pretty good after that. Its not fantasy in the sense that it has a bunch of dragons and elves and that kind of thing... its postapocalyptic in a little more of a Mad Max kind of way. There are wizards and things like that in the background but supernatural elements arent that huge. It has modern characters that get dragged into the story from present day America. I cant say if youd like it or not but its not fantasy in the Tolkien sense and if you give it a go Id advise you not to quit with the first book.

10603521,0,t3_5rovwt,I feel like this period the Hearts in Atlantis Dreamcatcher From a Buick  etc. is kind of Kings forgotten period. You hardly hear any mention of those books but that was the time I first started getting into him.I like Dreamcatcher but its definitely a very strange book. Some of the things that took me out of it were I felt there were too many references to pop culture. The XFiles style Greys the Ripley fungus brand references Apocalypse Now references... it felt like King was trying to do a homage to something but it wasnt clear what. And I say that with full knowledge that popbrand references are common in Kings work thats part of what makes him a good writer brands are ubiquitous in the world and their presence in his work makes us feel like were in his world. In Dreamcatcher it felt over the top somehow and had the opposite effect of taking me out of the work. I couldnt get absorbed into it because I could feel like he was trying to do something but I just wasnt getting it and it was slightly frustrating.Also the fart jokes the poop jokes... it felt like he was riding the line between horror and comedyhorror. I wanted him to commit to one or the other either go easy on the jokes or go full steam ahead with them. I love both genres I wouldnt mind if he tried to do a John Dies At The End kind of thing hes certainly experimented before. All in all I just wound up thinking a lot of what are you actually trying to do here Steve?If I could distill it down it felt forced. But thats totally forgivable because it was forced. He was literally forcing himself to start writing again.Its interesting that there are quite a few parallels here to his other alien invasion book The Tommyknockers. Both very weird books both critical disasters both written while he was completely out of his mind on drugs. Cocaine the former and painkillers the latter. Both have an experimental feel most likely due to his mindset. I disagree personally that its one of his finest but definitely not one of his worst. More an outlier in the canon I guess? Oh but did the movie ever suck. Lawrence Kasden no less Mr. Empire Strikes Back himself. I have no idea what went so wrong there.,stephenking,dd9o7uv,1,t5_2rce8

The kids really dont care what his name is.

11233641,0,t1_df4ss7y,Id say that it even fails in terms of its own storytelling but people dont notice it because theyre too wrapped up in the stunning visuals and the creepy atmosphere. The average moviegoer can only focus on so much at one time which is why people usually have vastly different opinions of a film after multiple viewings. If a director can give the audience something easy to focus on that ties directly into their entertainment they wont notice all the areas where the movie is flawed.

11379526,0,t1_dfle2x1,I actually rather liked the script myself. Some of the little alterations are odd like the name changes but a lot of the others make a great deal of sense to me.Regarding the ending Theyre going to have to change things just by virtue of how the film is going to be structured. In the book the two timelines get to the final confrontation simultaneously you cut back and forth between past and present as both the young and old Losers enter Its lair and battle the spider. By splitting the story into two movies one about the kids and one about the adults it means you cant do that. Youd have a movie and a sequel with almost identical climaxes. It makes sense to me for them to hint at Its true nature in the first film and then to do the full Ritual of Chd in the sequel. Also note this movie probably has a budget of less than  million compared to the  million plus of big CGI heavy blockbusters. Its also rated R which means the size of the box office audience is restricted. So theyre not going to throw the gobs of money at it youd need for a proper Ritual of Chd. Theyll wait to see how well this movie does and if it does well theyll throw the gobs of money at the sequel. Besides the script does provide a lot of nice hints. Spiders and turtles crop up repeatedly and its seriously implied in the final fight that you still havent seen Pennywises true form with his clown form distorting and moving like a spider. Ill agree the final rush to Its lair lacks weight in the script. Maybe thats why the final movie seems to have Richie going missing It takes him as bait and the Losers are forced to rush after him heedlessly. That would give them a more immediate impetus to go into the sewers. spoilerRegarding Stan and the forms of It Stan is easily the most under developed of the Losers in the book so I like that the script gives him more to do. Plus the Bar Mitzvah and the temptation of the seductress really tie into the books themes. With that sex scene obviously cut from any film adaptation it makes sense to have something new inserted in its place that tackles the fear of sex and growing up. Without it the full weight of those themes get put on Bevs relationship with her dad and it needs to be a bit more spread out with the other Losers I think. Plus the temptation scene is a nice homage to The Shining. One problem I do have with the script is an overuse of Pennywise. I get that they probably want to give his actor plenty of screentime but there should be a greater variety of forms for It to take. As is a lot of the initial encounters with It in the script are heavily shortened with Ben only seeing It in the back of a car when a couple wont stop to save him from the bullies and Richie only being menaced when they go swimming. The movie seems to be changing some of this Bens clearly getting more encounters with It for example and theyre including the Leper scene in the finished film. I think Id like to see the scene in the script with Stan and the seductress remain because I like how that plays into the themes. He can still recoil at the wrongness of that. But maybe move the Standpipe Kids to Richie. On the other hand now that theyre including the Kitchner Ironworks kids those sequences might be too similar. At any rate Im okay with it if they skip Richies childhood encounter with Paul Bunyan which I believe is chronologically his first encounter with It before the album in favor of something else. spoiler,stephenking,dflum84,1,t5_2rce8

There is deviations from the source material that I would say amount to the same as the Tim Curry film in number not the same changes. I think the sequel will be concerned with the adulthood aspects of the book.Its been brought forward to the s and there was a Rick James reference in what I read.
