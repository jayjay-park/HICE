5123364,0,t1_cv2oz2t,gt  College drinking isnt the problem. Rapists are the problem.I agree with your overall premise that we have to be very careful not to cross into victim blaming.  It is never the person who gets raped fault.  However if we have a ways to lessen the likelihood of this terrible act happening we should do it.  Rapists are THE problem.  College drinking is also a problem that sometimes relates to the rapists being a problem.  College drinking habits or blackout drinking habits create conditions where rape is significantly more likely.  While a person should be able to drink without getting raped and this is usually the case most blacked out people dont get raped there is some level of personal responsibility to not put yourself into potentially dangerous situations.   Education about rape and what constitutes consent education about drinking stricter drinking laws about overserving more safe ways home I think KU does a pretty good job with this but could do better and Im sure a host of other things...Im just trying to say that while the rapists are ultimately the ones at fault there are more things we could and should be doing to stop these dangerous situations from occurring.,Lawrence,cv3k2rr,1,t5_2rant

This should help some but kittens do have a lot of energy! If they begin to damage something clap your hands or make a loud noise this will make them stop. I would also suggest getting Soft Paws to cover their claws. Also if theyre not fixed do that asap as it will calm them down as well.
