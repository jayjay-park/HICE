2273911,0,t1_clsq8g5,Im pretty sure its the CPU causing the worst of the battery drain primarily because of how much it varies while the display is on.  I think the problem is the processor is much beefier so when its maxed out it drains battery much faster than older devices.  A crappy game like Township doesnt drain the Nexus  as much simply because the Nexus  consumes less power when its at  CPU usage.  However these crappy games are more obvious on the Nexus  where  CPU usage is x the power drain as the Nexus .Its like when the Starcraft  menu was frying peoples video cards because it was rendering at  fps and using  of the GPU even when it didnt need to.,Nexus9,clsrvwz,2,t5_2wi7m

The TFT had a really nice screen for watching youtube or movies but the battery life sucked and it was a pain in the ass to use because of the aspect ratio. I really wanted a  android tablet but I couldnt find any.Until the Nexus  came out. I was so excited when I saw the rumors and whatnot because it was literally and I mean that in the exact sense of the word the perfect tablet for me. Now that I have it in hands its everything I imagined it to be. The screen is beautiful Android L is great But not without its problems its so nice and easy to use with the  aspect ratio its fast etc.. Its just an allround really nice tablet.

Theyre definitely minor issues that Id get used to but Im just a bit disappointed about it...Thanks for the input on everything else by the way. I never thought about ads ramping up the CPU but the heat was mostly just something I noticed when it updatedand when Lollipop hit my Moto X it got much hotter than the nexus.

3554183,0,t1_cpx8k6e,Yeah  Im not impressed with mine either  at least not enough to recommend. Everything youve read about hardware buttons is true. Theyre really bad.  And Lollipop feels half baked most of the time. Lagging  crashing  you name it. Youd be better off getting a Nexus  with Kit Kat if you can find one.

3743730,0,t3_3391rm,So the caveat is take what I have to say with a grain of salt as I am not as knowledgeable about...stuff as when compared to others.With this being said for me its definitely been worth it.  I was previously rocking a  Nexus  and it got to the point where the thing was so slow it was literally unusable.  That and it wouldnt charge with any adapters other than the provided one from Asus.  Annoying.  I knew about all of the Nexus s shortcomings but the fact I was able to get a GB for  I was able to look beyond those easily.  My unit does have a bit of lightbleed and the volume buttons are a little iffy but again paying only  more for the cost of a N back in  Ive been happy.  Having completely stock Android is another plus Im a big fan of the Nexus line.Another caveat is I dont do intense things on the tablet mostly reading email and the like.

3768996,0,t3_33jfs3,I got to the point that I was rebooting the Nexus before each use as it was so bad.

So while you might not have had yours  months Ive had mine that long.gt And I never claimed you need to support it yourself rely on those that have a clue....Still many people dont want to have to support it.  A tablet is a consumer electronic device.  People expect it to run and if they dont theres no way to call Google and get a resolution.  The best they can do is come here and bitch about how fucked up it all is.Second ok were coming up on  months and I did say approx.  . came out Dec nd.  Today being May rd were at  months.  . came out Dec th but if youve got that youre in the very small minority AFAIK.So yes I am serious.  Check the calendar feel free to Google the dates I did to make sure I was right and go ahead and call me if I wrong but Im not.What perspective is that?  That we should be positive because Google cant release an update in  months?  That they cant be bothered to even communicate with us?  No official communication at all AFAIK.  The only perspective people are getting is its business as usual with Google the company of perpetual beta.  I could throw out a ton of other Google stuff they just ignore Voice  dont get me started Hangouts  yeah works sometimes Google Play Services  lol thats the biggest pain on my tablet thats not Android Chrome  largely being panned now as slow bloated and crappy Play Store  asks devs about that one  arbitrary rules that cant be appealed and arent detailed anywhere.  This could go on for a long while.You might ask why anyone would bother with Google.  Right now there arent a lot of choices.  We agree on iOS and its value or lack thereof and Windows Phone is stillborn at this point so that makes Android the best of a sorry lot at this point.  Letting them get away with it isnt going to help things.  If MS ever gets their act together on WinPhone Google is in for a world of hurt considering theyre dependent on the ad revenue.  Dont forget Google isnt a search company theyre an ad company.But Im going to be like the other guy  done with this.  You dont get it and I dont think you will.

This is the first Nexus Ive owned  GNex    P that I hate half the time Im using it but loved when I first got.

Even the January security update supposedly doesnt fix this issue.Thread on XDAReport at GoogleIf Google would add a rollback feature this wouldnt be such a big of an issue but since there isnt I cant be bothered with making backups and unlocking my device just because Google is too ignorant to give this any priority.,Nexus9,dc1oagz,1,t5_2wi7m

11069475,0,t1_demow30,I need it for running Garmin Pilot primarily. Everything else I use it for is extra mostly time wasting. The  screen would be a good size.
