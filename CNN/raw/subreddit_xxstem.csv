1534409,0,t3_2b6683,Hi everyone! So I am not actually in a STEM field  Im a writer. But Im working on building up my chops in writing about technology I love science almost pursued a chemistry path in college instead of writing and women in STEM is a major passion of mine. Cant wait to talk to you all!,xxstem,cj8m4gx,2,t5_32m3s

3073359,0,t3_2vbtwj,Ill be frank ladies. Im in a foul mood today. Started about midmorning and maybe its too much coffee. I just started a specialized program to learn Ruby and Im not enjoying it. I was hoping to get more networking opportunities from it but all of the scheduled stuff happens at a time no full time worker could go to. Ah. Frustration!On the work front things are going well. I sleuthed down a weird PHP issue with a clients site and weve started to do our own company version of  time where I am working on our external developer implementation documentation.,xxstem,cogjv4u,2,t5_32m3s

9054226,0,t3_54648b,I think most women in STEM have a story. My graduate advisor was straight up told by one guy when she was hired that he would never vote for her for tenure. But he just seemed a toxic person who made sexual comments to another female faculty member and ultimately got fired when he implied a female dean  couldnt do her job or something. But it normally breaks down to a few toxic dinosaurs who at present are more likely to be chairestenured professors who actively make antiwoman comments. Which are exhausting if youre a colleaguecollaboratorgrad student in the field and can be really discouraging if youre a student. I had an endocrinology class basically taught from the perspective of hormones make women crazy amirite?  But like on a professional level its just draining. Youll have colleagues or bosses who will socialize with male labmates and then snap at you for wasting time or ignore you. Or expect you to do all the cleaning. Its uaually not overt. But it all can come together to make you kimd of feel unwelcome if you dont have good labmates and a system to vent to. Like that shitty PI I had was practically untenable. I had to spend an entire summer convincing him an experiment couldnt be done due to system constraints. Meeting with heads of imaging departments at other universities summarizing mathematical and imaging papers wasting thousands of dollars and months optimizing a futile experiment and getting colleagues on board before he was like ok fine three weeks later a first semester male graduate student gave a  minute talk about something kind of similar he wanted to do in a wildly different cell type and all my work was toppled because the PI took him at his premise automatically. But thats kind of not uncommon. Hell in publication theyve found women need twice as many citations on first author papers to get into equivalent impact factor journals and a study of nameswapped cvs rank male applicants as more competent andentorable for identical achievements. So there can be a definite cognitive bias.But its usually not overt and the weird thing is theres frequently a bit of a disconnect where these troglodytes that do most of it dont see themselves like that can converse about yeah its bullshit when people do this to women and then go out and do the exact same thing.And also Ive encountered it far less among my peer group PhD studentspostdocs so maybe its something that could age out if were being optimistic. It just helps in the meantime to get a hell of a chip on your shoulder and find female faculty and colleagues to decompress with.,xxstem,d80695i,4,t5_32m3s
11386697,0,t3_62d30s,Well in the words of the woman herself gtI believe that there is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life.In other words who cares?Edit Sorry OP this isnt directed at you its my annoyance at the fact that there exists an article called The Super Secret Sex Life of Marie Curie.,xxstem,dfmnvfm,18,t5_32m3s
