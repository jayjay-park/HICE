4540274,0,t1_ct2lt3u,I mean  the extra speed really is more or less a complete waste as almost nobody has hardware capable of speeds greater than Gbps in their home. To take advantage of that you need at least a Gbps NIC for each computer that you would like to use  and a Gbps switch gt. Even if you only wanted this to provide Gbps speeds  devices simultaneously you would still need the expensive switch as you would need the Gbps connection to the modem.At this point in time Gbps is just... kinda dumb. It makes things way more expensive and complicated without offering any real benefit over Gbps. Again unless you are one of the . of home users that are using hardware capable of gtGbps this offers no benefit whatsoever over Google Fiber which is  the price has  the startup costs with no time commitment or  with a one year commitment and doesnt lock you into a contract with the devil for  years. It is really just a bigger dick contest at this point and once you get to a certain point that dick just becomes too big to be useful.,WarOnComcast,ct2xiag,8,t5_31hj4

5182575,0,t3_3lvrf5,UPDATE A Comcast Rep called me after the MDU Appointment The wiring outside. They called me because the rep got an alert that I was changing or cancelling my service and they were going to offer me a promotion. I told her I didnt even have service yet and she told me that it must have been a mistake. But while she was on the line I was curious what else it said about my service. So I asked her what my service was because I signed up for the blah blah blah deal. She then told me that the service she sees on my end is the exact service that I ordered. . a month mbps TV  Showtime Not sure why its now showtime instead of HBO but we I dont really care about that and me having my own modem. And with taxes it comes out to  something. I talked some more to her for a bit and then before I ended the call I had her confirm the service that I have and once again she told me thats what I have. I have the call recorded and everything. So thats a relief hopefully I wont have any more problems with that but if I do I have actually proof from a rep. ,WarOnComcast,cvaouov,3,t5_31hj4
