4242746,0,t3_39hoh3,I was sober four years I got sober after an extraordinarily bad time in my life typical shit now that I look back on it but life shattering then. I worked in the bar business which didnt help matters. It was commonplace to drink on shift to hit to am bars after your shift was over.I got busted for DWI.Twice.I went cold turkey no AA or anything just mind over matter. I never craved alcohol never needed it to function. I changed jobs changed habits and didnt think about it. After four years and a  swing in my life I decided what can one glass of wine hurt?And it didnt hurt anything. I was moderate for several years but did start to slip back into old binge drinking patterns because I was surrounded by my binge drinking or functional alcoholic friends.I stopped myself before I was back where it all started. Now I drink rarely and if I do Im on a strict self imposed  beer no shots or one double GampT limit. It just doesnt have the appeal to me that it once did. I come from a long line of alcoholics I know Ive most certainly got the propensity to get stupid drunk on a near nightly basis. But its just not fun like it once was.,steppingout,cs3v4gl,2,t5_38lk9
