With the chrome bumper ala Boss  and painted fenderhood edge pieces with the scooped hood its likely that this car has had the Mach  treatment and didnt roll out of the factory looking like it does now.  If the grill has been changed from the stock  grill there wont be provisions for wiring the sportlamps or the correct grill supports and that may be why they chose to do their own grill treatment.

I think the v could easily net me whp.If I get the standard kit for about k I can later upgrade and I would drive it around with the tune vortech sends hp at the crank for a little bit and then later go and get it dyno tunedThe High output kit is about  comes with a slightly smaller pulley and an airwater intercooler and its tune that it comes with is hp.  Not sure what to go with.  It is a lot of money and even the base kit is going to be a big increase.My eventual plan is to run the supercharger with my exhaust and a bigger throttle body and the ford racing intake plenum with a dyno tune and then have a CARB legal tune stored on my hand held tuner so when I need to get smogged I can just put the stock manifold and throttle body back on reflash the car get it smogged and then go back to beast mode,Mustang,cfbzlsb,2,t5_2qqel

451674,0,t1_cfrlaf3,I think until these cars are released to the general public and press it is difficult to make any solid claims with regards to loving it or hating it. Granted anyone can have an opinion on the appearance of the car I also think its important to wait until it has been seen in person before saying anything and writing it in stone. The previous generation mustang has its appeal for numerous reason and I think the reason some people struggle with this new design is because Ford has decided to make this car part of its global brand. Mustang now shares design cues with the rest of Fords line up and for a long time Mustang largely was seen as a separate entity. I can see how this would bother people.    So far I personally am a fan of the car. It needs to be taken for what it is and what it is aiming to do. I think its important Ford brings this car into the future and thats what it looks like they are doing. ,Mustang,cfrlr09,6,t5_2qqel

1020138,0,t1_chk8dnf,I  not speculating purely on muffler . I am looking at it in context to the fact its a GT test mule with a possible power plant that was thought to be nonexistant. There is enough reputable information within the th gen community to know that the next high tier mustang is due out late MY . And this is likely based on the puremount of S test mules still in camo with aggressive wheeltirebrake and traditional V exhaust notes... I live just outside of Detroit I see more of them than regular Ss. Now there is much less confirmed information about the new or improved powerplant. However weknow there are packaging restrains evident by the . GT Trinity motor not coming back. So a powerful or high reving NA motor falls inline with the GT  legacy and packaging. A FPC motor has been talked about but little acutal proof of one has surfaced however its never really been discredited by known sources of reliable information of the new mustang program. What we do know is the next high tier mustang is being primarly funded by Ford Racing and will likely be raced by Rousch. Ford has beat Europe at its own game before and the S is benchmarked against the M and .Given all the information and lack there of for that matter about the high tier mustangs motor. This video may be a good indication of what the future motor is since its a modified V exhaust system. It doesnt sound boosted however it does sound like. FPC motor. That coupled and all information of pricing and trim level shows the eco boost is the mid range performance option for the Mustang. Not the NA V which isnt going global and global platforms is Ford new plan. Infact most information suggested the V may be phased out of the mustang line not expanded in NA trim.  Using a Viper for a SLS project is a rather poor example given that those companies where merged at own point and their performance offerings while the point Id valid its not near as valid in this context.,Mustang,chk8w5c,1,t5_2qqel

1525025,0,t3_2bo55b,Im going to answer this with basically limited technical knowledge...  Yes the filters typically allow more dirt particles in as I believe they filter a little bit worse than a typical paper filter my stock ford racing intake filer was a giant paper cone as is I believe some of the newer ones. One that would filter the best would again be a paper filter but less air may come through.  Something like a KampN filter would be perfect as they are oiled to catch fine particles and carry warranties My CAI has been installed for  miles the cars whole life as it came with it.  k of that had the original paper filter last k a KampN replacement.   You wont really get much benifit out of the CAI without a tune.  Im not sure if it will throw a check engine but without the tune it maybe virtually pointless to get one not sure what powercore is...For the most part whatever fine particles the filter isnt getting shouldnt have much of an effect.  people have been running things like KampN and the likes for man years on many high mile applications.  Also as I understand it the dirtier the filter gets the more it filters the air but also less air to the motor.  so its a trade off of sorts.EDIT clearly I dont know how to use bullett points.  ,Mustang,cj7ft7i,3,t5_2qqel

2700628,0,t1_cnb1e1p,gt No engine makes more power off of higher octane fuel unless it is already retarding timing due to knock.Absolutely not true.  Adaptive timing control will optimize the spark advancement on the fly to maximize the power.  If you put in high octane fuel the timing will advance further producing more power.Many engines do this its a feature thats been around since the s.  When I would tune WRXes there was an entire table in the ECU devoted to timing advancement.  You could control how long between advancement advancement stepping degree retard stepping degree and maximum advancement.If you dont believe me then maybe youll believe Fords powertrain engineers they literally say if you use premium fuel in the V to expect higher than SAE power figures.gt On the flip side the ECU has been reprogrammed with adaptiveknock spark control. If the two knock sensors embedded in the cylinder block dont hear knocking the ECU will keep advancing the spark until it does.  What this means in performance terms is that if the owner uses premium or race gas on weekends the engine should make considerably more power and torque than the numbers quoted here.SourceNot just more power but considerably more power.,Mustang,cnb1unu,0,t5_2qqel

2850762,0,t1_cnp5v4e,I assume you are talking about the tires.  The ones on the bottom are known as street slicks.  They have one purpose and that is to make the car hook specifically when on the track.  They are made of a much softer compound to promote grip.  The difference on a car that needs them is worth the expense.  For example my  ran a high  on my  gears with the drag radials and a mid  on the stock .? Cant remember the ratio with slicks.  In other words the slicks allowed for a faster pass with a shorter gear because of adhesion.  The DRs spun through rd gear.  The slicks only spin when I want them to.  They also have more sidewall and are run at a different pressure.  I have not been to the track with the new gears but I expect to run around a . or better.  Because of the soft compound and no channels they are not meant for daily driving but they are DOT approved.For wheels I do run  different styles.  My rear wheels on my slicks are a race wheel.

3080434,0,t3_2vd1iu,I actually kinda like the split five spokes as far as stock wheels go.My goto short list on mods is Fulllength weldin subframe connectors  I went with Maxiumum Motorsports. Tightens up the whole car. These are less of a mod to me and more of a correction of factory oversight everyone should have these. Short throw shifter  Ive always gone with the Steeda TriAx but anything will be better than stock. This and the subframes take a lot of the sloppiness out of the driving experience. Gears  I stick with Ford Racing for these. My Mach has .s and I had .s in my GT. Really wakes up these cars. Catback or weldin mufflers  I have Flowmasters welded in to my stock catback. This is pretty much for sound. The difference in performance between chambered and straightthrough mufflers and whether or not you get a full catback with bigger piping on a stockish car is pretty much splitting hairs. Get whatever you think sounds good. Midpipe  Ive had MAC stuff. The ProChamber on my GT sounded better but always seemed to leak I havent had any troubles with the H pipe on my Mach. This is if you want more sound and some power. X or H comes down to preference and offroad vs catted is a matter of your budget and how you prioritize things like exhaust smell volume and inspection compliance.,Mustang,coha9qo,1,t5_2qqel

Not faster as in quarter mile or balls to the wall race just a lot more peppy particularly within the city. On the highway there would be no meaningful difference. To me having an always peppy car is more fun than a conditionally peppy car. Now if this was  years ago with older automatic transmission no thanks. The little  speed auto in the newer cars is actually pretty damn nice.As far as road trips the Cobra clutches were heavy as hell which I understand they have fixed on newer cars. When I do road trips it isnt  interstate and we see stuff along the way. If I was just going from point ab you are absolutely correct.Honestly I cant think of a single advantage of a manual transmission anymore at least for me.

3505134,0,t3_30dws7,Like others said... Its easy to do..One tip..   Take the negative cable off first then the positive then pull the battery..   When you put the new battery in put on the positive cable first then the negative.  This way if you accidentally touch the wrench between the battery and the car you dont get any sparkarcing. Personally we are currently running an optima red top in our  v.  It wasnt needed but I prefer AGM batteries to typical wet cell batteries.  There is no outgassing which means less corrosion on the battery terminals and you dont have to worry about evaporating electrolyte even sealed wet cells have that issue ...   I typically run DieHard Advanced Gold batteries now as there is a Sears in just about every US city.  Optima batteries are a little harder to swap out..

3973374,0,t1_cr95bti,It depends on how big the slits are how far apart they are and if having multiples disrupts the effect you are trying to create. For example if the forward lip of the extractor helps create that area of suction having multiples in a row so close together ends up creating a pocket that ignores the rest of the ridges reducing their effectiveness while the extra slits reduces the suction creating from just a single opening thats taking advantage of it. The roush set might be better at a standstill while being worse at speed for example. Again Id have to see models before I can definitively say which is better. There is a whole lot of airflow management and stuff that goes on inside the bay that relies on the grillfront end of the car so it could be completely possible that the Roush set is better suited for cars with their front end for example.  You can see Ford using some of that with the number of holes cut in the honeycomb that feeds into the intake. Why did they remove the number that they did? Why not more?  ,Mustang,cr974th,1,t5_2qqel

4041299,0,t3_36rta8,What you should do if you have a trade in is take it to car max and get their free appraisal. Theyll give you paperwork with their offer and you can take that to the dealer with you. Negotiate the price of the car before you mention the trade in. Then ask for any incentives that they may have available. Get the number locked down when youre happy with it. Then tell them what your trade in is and let them give you a number. If its higher than the car max offer take that. If its lower mention that you have another offer from car max and they will likely match it. If you tell them about the trade in before you lock in the price of the new car they have more room to play with the numbers and make more money off of you.

Youre putting excess stress on something not meant to take it and youre only going to gain so much.  With engine mods you get what you pay for. Going cheap is almost never the best option. A little turbo might be a better option but you run into the same wall. ,Mustang,crs6rve,-6,t5_2qqel

4737289,0,t3_3ft0vb,Ive got two stories! Here it goesI saved up for over a year in preparation of moving to the states for a few years for college. I never considered a Mustang because I figured it was out of my price range.A few weeks before I left for the U.S. my uncles went to a dealership to check out a Cobalt SS SC for me. They test drove it as well as an  v that wasnt on the dealerships site and they liked the Mustang much more.I came to the states shortly after and bought it in cash. I owned that car for just over  years before I totaled it. I was heart broken.I spent the next two weeks waiting for my insurance check and looking for many different cars in my area. I considered a few cars strongly namely Mustangs Crossfires SRTs and even Volvo wagons.My dad flew to the U.S. to help me look and to drive me around. We drove about  miles down the interstate and stopped at nearly every dealership in the way down. About  miles down we stopped at a dealership that had an  GT manual that had high mileage but was in excellent condition. It was at the top of my price range so we continued on. On the way back home that night we stopped at the dealership with the  and I bought it.I couldnt take the car home right then as I had to wait for the check to clear. A day or two later we went back and picked it up. I had very little experience driving a manual and got to drive the  miles home in the rain. I dont think I stalled it on the way home but I sure did for the next few days!Ive had my  for almost two years now and I love it!,Mustang,ctrofx9,4,t5_2qqel

4779679,0,t1_ctq4o36,May have been me I posted up complaining about my experience. OP I bought a set of wheels from AM and two came dentedscratched pretty bad. They had me take pictures and send it to them to prove the damage.  Then I had to purchase two additional wheels as replacements send the damaged ones back and then get a refund after the fact. One of the two replacements that I received days later was again damaged. Had to repeat the process for the damaged replacement. This time they dicked around about shipping out the replacement of the replacement even though I had to again purchase another wheel in other words it was paid for but they dragged ass shipping it out and every rep I called didnt have a clue as to why and every time assured me it would be shipped out tomorrow this was supposed to have been  day shipping I had expedited All in all I ended up charging up my credit card for  wheels....yes I had to buy seven wheels before getting  that werent damaged. Took a total of  and a half weeks and literally no exaggerating calling them multiple times a day during those  and a half weeks trying to get answers. It was a horrible horrible experience and I wont buy from them again because of it. Maybe it was all UPS that damaged them I dunno I just hated the way they handled the situation and the way I was treated when trying to get it resolved. Which is odd because I always hear a lot of praise about their customer service. Anyway if you just get wheels they come in a large box they have a real thin piece of foam on top of the wheels think electronics packaging foam sheets x boxs TVs surround sound sets etc...  use them on top of the foam holding it in place is a flimsy plastic ring that I assume is meant to protect the edges of the wheels this is where my damage was every time whatever happened ate right through said ring then topping it off is a thin piece of cardboard with a hole in the middle. A lot of people have received their wheels in good condition but after some googling there were some other stories like mine so I guess its a your mileage may vary kind of thing. Good luck. ,Mustang,ctx0pj2,1,t5_2qqel

My first one was on protoboard and had a hardcoded sequence speed. The last set I made I had those PCBs and I programmed it so that once installed you turned on your way flashers for  flashes and then it selfcalibrated the speed.

5885218,0,t3_3vvicm,First off the Stereo system might look factory but aftermarket will work better. I find the Raxiom navigation is junk Ebay units. I would recommend Kenwood or JVC it might not look factory but I think you will enjoy it better. Getting a shop to install is recommended. Aftermarket speakers are up to you but they are pretty simple to swap especially when you get the adapters for the factory plugs. Here are the factory plug adapters so you dont have to cut and splice your speaker wires.For the shifter I would recommend the MGW Shifter from a lot of people reviewing multiple shifters the MGW is the best one on the market. Here is a link to the MGW Shifter. For a more pleasant driving experience I would spend the money on suspension for example coilovers with supporting mods. They are about  US for a good set. You can also get some different rims and tires if you like unless you want to keep the stock look so to speak. If you want a really nice sound for exhaust that is also loud and doesnt provide any drone I would recommend the Corsa Sports This Video is what sold me on the Corsa Sports a nice sound really loud but no drone. Anyways that is my opinion I currently have a DDX in my  Mustang with stock system I plan on doing the Kicker Upgrade in the subs in the doors and most likely the Kicker speakers. I also have the MGW shifter in my car on the th notch and I absolutely love it nice and short and feels great when driving. My Current exhaust is Ford Racing Shorties Bassani Catted Xpipe with Ford Racing Tourings out the back its louder then stock and still sounds amazing. Here is a link to a video of my car. Let me know if you have anymore question and I will try my best to answer them. ,Mustang,cxr33dc,3,t5_2qqel

6706756,0,t1_d0d19l0,Well I had a  Runner wd with a v and loved that thing to death and was my first car in . But last year the repairs became to much and I decided it was time for a new car. I really wanted a mustang but it just wasnt the right time yet for it and decided to get a  Mazda . Its nice and all with leather and sunroof and Bose and everything. My plan was to pay of this car in  years and save up some money for a mustang after that. I personally want a  gt premium and have so many ideas and plans for when I do finally get it. ,Mustang,d0d1bfj,2,t5_2qqel

6728110,0,t3_47qode,I cant tell you if youd be disappointed or not. If its too much financially Id just get a base GT. Youd still get the . of course. Ill tell you my experience when I ordered my . I was worrying about being disappointed with a base model too and ended up being happier with the base model.I ordered my car in December of  once I saw spy shots of the . I liked them but I had my mind made up and parts list laid out already. I just love the way the  and s look. Anyway... I really wanted the premium because of the leather sound system upgrade and SYNC. It was too expensive I couldve probably gotten a Boss  with a few thousand miles on it for the same price if I looked hard enough.I ended up going with a basic Black  with a  spd the Track Pack and the Recaro seats. While this is my personal opinion I dont regret getting the base model. The cloth is comfortable and I dont have to worry about touching the seats with bare skin during the summer or winter. The sound system is just alright no real low end but since Ive gotten exhaust and cams I dont even use it  of the time. I wouldve really liked to have navigation but considering that I wouldve had to get the Premium model and then on top of that another  est to get the nav it just simply wasnt worth it. I use my phonegoogle maps and that of course works excellent.Id have to look at my paperwork but I remember with the track pack and recaro seat being the only options I paid a little over  after taxes which was an excellent deal great relationship with sales managerfamily friend. JUST to get the navigation meaning the Premium and then the electronics package I wouldve been at about . Add the Recaros and the Track Pack options I got on the base and youre looking at  easy. Keep in mind my pricing isnt accurate due to my car being a  ordered back in  with the dealer hook I had. NOT a .While a Mustang GT isnt a Z Vette or anything its still a very sporty car and begs to be driven. If you really enjoy driving the way I do you would be better off with a performance specd  for MUCH cheaper than an equally specd out Premium. I really doubt youd miss the leather and other stuff. Youd be saving some serious skrilla with a base model.Again we cant tell you if youd be disappointed however I can tell you that I wasnt. Its up to you and whatever you choose Im SURE youll enjoy.EDIT Some quick clarification in case anyone is curious reference the pricingordering Im on Long Island in NY. ,Mustang,d0f8uct,1,t5_2qqel

6827745,0,t3_495n1a,ushelby pretty much nailed it on the head. I knew there was going to be something very different about owning this car when I picked it up in July.  Less than  miles off the lot a  year high school kid with his learners permit had his mom taking photos of us nearly the whole way home. That trend continued on for the entirety of last summer to the point of embarrassment on a few occasions. The high school kid with his permit got me the most though. I very clearly remember a  year old me at the grocery store clenching the latest issue of Car ampamp Driver maybe Motor Trend with the new legend lime  GT tearing around an imaginary corner.  years a wife k a lot less hair and I made it happen. Just in time for the s.Do I look back at the s  years later and feel like its a classic? Nope. My classic? Not yet. The s? I hope so in time. There is going to be a meh period for every model regardless of its generations strong points. Some cars are and will inevitably be more nostalgic or collectible than others. At this moment I feel like the s has a very strong case moving forward towards that likeness probably more so than the s. ,Mustang,d0q83ns,3,t5_2qqel
6828739,0,t3_498hhi,Personally I just think this is very dependant on where you live. Aftermarket usually adds nothing unless your mods are extreme like basically selling a complete track car then the value is good but a street driver with some mods might take away value because it means you might of beaten it. I think youre asking way to much for a  year old car but I also live in Michigan so honestly this just really depends.

If you dont see a leak then its probably low brake pads extending out the caliper Pistons to max and using more brake fluid. Is it topped off? Maybe the fluid is pushing back with the force of the acceleration causing the floater in the master cylinder to go down and maying it think it has low brake fluid.

On street tires do not go through the water box. Drive around it. Street tires also dont react the same way as drag radials or slicks to heat.

Your ground wire needs to have contact with bare metal. To properly ground your amp cut a small hold in the carpet to expose your frame drill a hole then sand around the hole to get a good connection! Then you run your remote wire to your radio which depends on what radio you have but Im sure theres a guide online. After that you run your speaker wire. A more advanced guide online would help you. Ive put in  sub systems in my life  years old. If you follow the directions and do everything right it should go smoothly.

Whats important will be getting your monies worth out of it. For a newer model with better build quality and lower overall costs for essentially the same performance better handling from the V mostly because of less weight over the front axle limiting understeer prone in the GT.

8088949,0,t3_4pyopn,If you have a vehicle to trade in probably. If you have a clean driving record that can get you insurance discounts definitely. Ultimately it will depend on your anticipated living expenses but heres how I did it.Last month I bought a  GT Premium with k miles on it and no accidentspreexisting mechanical problems. The asking price was just under k but I only financed k after talking them down a few hundred putting down a k deposit and receiving k on my tradein. My payment is month for  months but Im planning to overpay each month in order to shorten the length of the loan I should have it paid off in  months.I was more concerned about the cost of insurance. Im a  year old female with no accidents tickets or warnings. After all of my discounts with State Farm my payment is month for low deductible high coverage my same amount of coverage was previously month.So far no regrets. I knew I wanted a  GT for a long time and the mileage only goes up as time passes. Although its expensive in the shortterm owning your dream car or at least one of them  in the prime of its life AND your life is pretty priceless.Hope this helps!,Mustang,d4p9ssl,2,t5_2qqel

Before anyone flips out over me recommending a GT Id like to point out that late model  cylinder family cars are capable of sub  second  mile times and that many  cylinder or turbo versions of the same family cars are capable of times in the  second range.  Id also make a rule that if he wants to modify the car he or she would have to start with the brakes and suspension before any engine mods. I would also require that they would undergo driver education actual hands on stuff not just the theory stuff they teach you in drivers ed and autocross the car regularly so they would know how the car handles at the limit and how to react appropriately.,Mustang,d6bv1xm,1,t5_2qqel

9877215,0,t3_5gph63,So they dynotested and found exactly what most of us probably expected The stock GT manifold has the best lowend torque making it still the best for a daily driver road racer or autocrosser. The most peak horsepower will come out of the Cobra Jet intake if youre looking for low mile times or just looking for max gains. The Boss  and GT manifolds are fairly costeffective upgrades with nice peak HP gains though the former is an easy dropin for the  Coyote engines while the GT requires no adapter for the  Coyote.By the way if youre interested in the GT manifold for your S GT and want the warrantyfriendly tune that comes with it this power pack is what youre looking for. If your daily driver would be happier with a cheaper power pack that gives off a much better torque boost check this one out. Id go with Power Pack  in a heartbeat.,Mustang,dav0vlo,2,t5_2qqel

10369443,0,t1_dcje6n6,Yeah lol seemed like everything liked to touch those damn headers.  My tachometer never worked in mine just had to shift by the sound.  When I was learning we took thin little strips of masking tape and put it on various spots on the speedometer to mark when to shift LOL.  Come to think of it I doubt I ever peeled em off during the duration of owning that car.  I wonder now if the headers had burned through that cable.  Dont know where that thing ran along.  I had to replace a clutch cable too.  Felt like I could hear and feel it grinding against something and sure enough when it came time to rebuild my tranny the mechanic said my clutch cable was getting frayed.  That was another fun experience I was down in SoCal visiting the aforementioned aunt and my tranny got stuck in rd gear.I dont know I like the look of my current car well enough but it had to grow on me.  I remember seeing the pics and going WTF?  This doesnt look like a mustang to me!  I think my favorite look was my  GT.  My only regret with that car was settling for an automatic.  I had those quarter panel louvers that and the headlights gave it a good throwback feel to the s and s.  All I needed was some louvers for the rear window lol.  I think I may slap those on the back and the two quarter panel windows on my  at some point in the future.Hell yeah these cars deserve to be daily driven.  I say take good care of them but also dont baby it lol.  Im depressed leaving my car parked right now for the winter.  Been driving it every chance I get when roads are clear but with the torque and the summer tires that came with the PP it just doesnt stand a chance in the snow.  My options were to either spend about  on a set of snow tires and extra rims or spend about that much on a winter beater.

Going by the ad most of the car has been meddled with and theres no way to know the quality of the mechanic that did the work.  In my opinion theres a lot of risk involved in this car so you should avoid it.  Beyond that you cant get hp from the . V or the .L for that matter without extensive modifications so thats likely BS.  The price is on the high side if that car was in the US and didnt have a blown motor in its history.  Not sure about the Canadian market.  Even if the price is fair theres no way of knowing the miles on the new engine and it could simply fail  miles after you purchase it.
