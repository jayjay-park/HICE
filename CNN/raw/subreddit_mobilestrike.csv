6632364,0,t3_46i72g,Im startng to come to the conclusion that the reason there is no good fanforums or tipsites etc is because the game is fundamentally flawed. Its not really a game but a cashcow for the subpar developers or more likely the investors.There is nothing you can do against a player spending money and the costs are enormous. Game dynamics are worse than FarmVille and seems more boring. Im personally just aiming to go out with a bang at the moment but that special moment will never arrive in this game. Smart thing would be to just say byebye instead of buybuy.,mobilestrike,d05cdxf,1,t5_3aqaa

9759835,0,t3_5eqlz8,This isnt an official itemized list but currently the top gear sets are the anniversary set for attack  itll easily get your attack over  if you max out your mod set bonus research and use a set boost as well  and the Hammerhead set for defense. Note the Garrison set is the newest one and is designed for defense but because I dont have enough of the pieces to compare the boosts to my hammerhead gear Ill only talk about that.I dont have a full set of anniversary but I have the helmet three accessories and body armor and have replaced those parts of my Lone Wolf gear with those items. The set bonus was worth giving up as with the mod set bonuses active my overall troop attack is in the region of . I have barely started mercenary gear and havent reached the bottom of building development but the latter gives you a  boost to attack health and defense at  on the respective node. The garrison set was recently released but I dont have a full set of it either and am thus sticking with my hammerhead gear set. I have it full of the Halloween defense mods and am currently at  troop defense yesterday I ate a  maxed out advanced T rally with the leader in full lone wolf gear and each player well above b power. Personally my base is .b power and I have m troops with no tier  and no mercenary troops. I also have a full k trap wall full of standard T traps and they only filled my hospitals k and killed about m T. Ill take the trade for their full T rally and the instant elimination on the leaders commander  times. For resources the economist gear is still at the top though even with full Lvl  production buildings and my level  commander speccd for resource production it doesnt touch the requirements for research or the troop production I need. For research gear the Ground Breaker set the weapon is named Atom Splitter is still the best you can get. Edit had to check the app but Barracks Buster is the best training gear you can get. Note the weapon named The Enforcer is way better than the rest of the other pieces. ,mobilestrike,dag494v,1,t5_3aqaa
