372860,0,t1_cfd9coj,Theres also a dual CpECS program. With a single summer semester it can be done in  years. My brother did CpEEE with a minor in CS in  years and had a paid internship fulltime job after graduation and paid Masters degree with Mylan and he wrote A LOT of code as an intern. Either CpE or CS alone can get you into the field. I did straight CS and completed the Army ROTC program in lieu of a dual degree. I now work fulltime midlevel System Admin. Using WVUs shell server and their LOUD LCSEE Optimized Ubuntu Distro counted as  years of Linux experience to land a journeyman position instead of entrylevel straight out of college. I loved CS a lot of my classes didnt have finals. We had coding projects instead with more than half the semester to work on them or a semesterlong project broken into different modules where each module counted as an exam. Thats an entire class with ZERO exams. I cant remember ever having more than  finals all in elective classes in a semester. A lot of my friends and ROTC buddies had  finals each semester. ,WVU,cfjeuko,1,t5_2spb6

879957,0,t3_2472ga,And here we have another ATampT device. This one is nice because its a decent product for the price but you get this shiny new  year contract in which you dont really own your device. Unless youre rich of course then you dont need that plan. But thats not all! Ever wanted a device that comes with all these apps that you will never use unless youre in your s and dont know what apps are? Well then this device is for you! Sure they bloat your OS and slow it down but the good news is you can never lose them! And by that we mean you cant get rid of em! Believe us weve tried. Sure you could root the phone cough but it voids your warranty coughThere you go ATampT all that I request is you cite me.Im only slightly cynical.,WVU,ch4az29,2,t5_2spb6
