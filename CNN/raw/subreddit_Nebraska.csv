635210,0,t3_20ohsx,Dorthy Lynch salad dressing.  I hate it.  Others love it.  Runzas are fricking nasty but damn I love them.  I get some whenever Im in the state.  Anything czech...like kolaches.  The Bohemian Cafe does have my favorite and isnt too far off the interstate.  Im sure you could find some in Lincoln pretty easily made by the Wahoo bakery.  Stoysich House of meats on south th in Omaha also has them and various other goodies.  Thatd be my recommendation on where to stop and get something.  There is also a cake that I only know of as the czech word for cake.  Its like a poppyseed roll up.  If you can find one of those theyre good.  ,Nebraska,cgch2g3,1,t5_2qo70

1583066,0,t1_cjeo21z,The article posted is only talking about individuals who were granted deferred action through DACA. Those people are in similar situations as my friend. Those people had to apply for DACA and were granted deferred action and allowed to work and given social security cards but are still not allowed to drive.

1935634,0,t3_2gss4n,Part of the pricing is that this is the only decent nonconference opponent that Nebraska faces this year and its against an old rival from the s. There is more interest in this game from people because Nebraska will not often play Miami unless its in a bowl game. Your best bet for low price tickets is as previously posted outside the stadium. If you dont mind missing the beginning wait until a little after the game has started and you can sometimes find seats below face value as scalpers are trying to get back any money they can. Cant promise they will be good or even decent seats but they would be inexpensive.,Nebraska,ckmfkdc,2,t5_2qo70

Also its always the older generation saying the younger generation is self centered and arrogant. From Socrates complaining about his ungrateful pupils to the s to s from the s to the s s to today.

10281609,0,t1_dc9gnkd,Yes it is.  Giving outofstate companies that dont generate any local jobs a tax break while taxing local companies is not good for the economy.
