7742936,0,t1_d3m2tzz,Oh wow thats an amazing find!I guess there is a reason to read manuals. I couldnt find anything interesting in the first pages so I expected all else to be common knowledge too. Thanks!EDIT while Im looking at it it says its for disposal only and considering you just take out the screen with a suction cup and force I dont think you can put it back together too easily. Then again at least we know now how to open the device if ever necessary.,LumixCM1,d3mbdeg,1,t5_3e4mb
