10898468,0,t3_5trhkb,Its just the way they operate  clueless.I bought a phone on there once that turned out to be a scam demanded that I immediately rate him so he could take the money amp run. I reported it to Support and they put my account in review threatening to ban me for it. After talking to  customer service reps I finally went on their Facebook before finding someone who would pay enough attention to read that I was the VICTIM not the scammer and take the review off my account. Dont worry youre better off without them.,Mercari,de43lj2,2,t5_3fhq0
