58936,0,t3_1uqzhj,FYI Im condensing the subject and not always using proper legal terms.What youre describing is not unprecedented and basically describes the world prior to the formalization of corporations as a standardized legal construct.It is important to differentiate between the two types of liability afforded to investors under the traditional corporation Financial liability which prevents the assets of shareholders from being seized to pay the corporations debts and criminal or tort liability which prevents the shareholders from being personally named as defendants in suits or charges brought against the company.In terms of financial liability there might be little difference as many parties would simply include limitations of liability in each and every contract they enter into that had previously been conducted under the umbrella limitation of liability afforded by the corporation. Bonds for example would specify that in the event of nonpayment by the firm the bondholder has waived in advance his right to collect from the assets of the shareholders. Similar language could be appended to the fine print of all of the firms contracts.The limited financial liability of the corporation is thus not something that can be easily done away with. Since it only extends to parties who have entered into existing agreements with the firm the corporation in its essential form does not afford shareholders any additional privileges than they already have as individuals. There will continue to exist parties willing to buy into a firm on the condition of limited liability and there will continue to exist parties willing to do business with the firm on those terms.For the purposes of answering your question If the only option were unlimited liability in all contracts business dealings would be limited to parties who had much greater trust in each other and the scope of economic activity would shrink as only the more predictable ventures would be undertaken. The valuations of all firms would decrease as the stock price would have to be discounted based on the perceived risk of firms bankruptcy creating a contagion that drains wealth from the shareholders personal savings accounts homes etc. In general it would be a rather miserable experience and we should be thankful that we have varying degrees of liability available to us. By making these limitations clear in the form of corporations with charters the share of potential ventures that can be fully realized by society is greatly expanded.Protection of liability from torts is a more complicated issue owing to the fact that the parties owed damages by the firm will usually not have prior contracts with the firm that specify whose assets can be seized to pay the debt. The problem then becomes societys conception of the scope of responsibility for crimes. Once again however it is not clear that the removal of de jure criminal liability protections will keep them from remaining similar de facto. This is because no theory of justice likely to exist in the modern world requires that the owner of something be automatically bound to an unbroken chain of unlimited liability from every tortcrime involving that asset as if it is an extension of his mind.This is best illustrated with an example. Parents frequently lend cars to their teenage children. Teenagers in turn sometimes get issued moving violations while using them or worse cause damage to others. However most would not say that the parents each a  shareholder in the car are automatically liable for all torts involving it. Similarly most would agree that the shareholders of a corporation are not necessarily criminally liable if a company truckdriver injures a pedestrian in his own fault. This is because we recognize that they were not party to the criminal action itself and the mens rea is not necessarily imputed to them. They may however be exposed to liability if they were negligent or otherwise contributed to the criminal act. For example parents have been found criminally responsible if they provided the car to a teenager they knew had a history of drunk diving. Similarly if shareholders could be said to have reasonable knowledge that they were contributing to the truckdrivers criminal action perhaps hiring alcoholics to save money then they could be said to be partly responsible in a similar way. The point is that were recognize that the person or firm liable for a crime was not necessarily acting as an agent of the shareholders in doing so.In the parentchild case this liability is all usually decided by judgesjuries on a casebycase basis. However suppose that the state does away with this instead formalizing the parentchild carlending relationship in such a way that the scope of criminal liability is standardized and clearly delineated for all such transactions. This is roughly analogous to how corporations exist at present. The shareholders have an explicit protection in most circumstances from liability for criminal actions by the company that they were not party to and all corporations have the same template for their treatment in the courts.If the state were to remove the formal template for the carlending you can see how this would not necessarily make the parents more liable on balance because the application of judgement in practice may differ little from what was made explicit by law. The same can be said for the hypothetical removal of the states formal protections of criminal liability for shareholders in the context of a corporation. Since most shareholders are only involved in the operations of the corporation on a very general level when actual cases are brought against the firm it will usually prove very difficult to impute liability to the individual shareholders. Consequently very little may change  although one difference would be that shareholders would have less certainty in any legal proceedings and would generally act more conservatively.Once again to answer your question more literally imagine if the state mandated full liability for all parents who lent cars to children. With no protections available to them naturally such lending would be greatly reduced only available to extremely trusted teenagers. Many would never have the opportunity to learn to drive at all so great is the risk. So it is with the corporation Let us suppose that full criminal liability were the only option available in all stockholder arrangements. Quite simply modern business would be extremely difficult as each shareholder would have his personal assets and possibly jail time hanging in the balance in the case of every manufacturing defect or abusive boss which they can hardly be expected to have knowledge of. Economic activity would be substantially reduced limited only to those individuals who know and trust each other personally and to those business ventures that investors have a detailed knowledge of.In  BC the Code of Hammurabi with its strict fullliability for defective craftsmanship was a useful and simple construct and well suited to a world of sole proprietorships and individual tradesman who were personally involved in most aspects of a business deal. It is in this spirit that some advocate the removal of what they see as the privileges of the capitalist shareholder class in being generally shielded from the sometimes irresponsible actions of the firm. However our legal traditions have developed with the recognition that responsibility is rarely so clearcut or categorical. Any society that wishes to coordinate actions on a large scale with parties who cant always have full faith in one other requires a more nuanced conception of criminal and financial liability if commerce is to expand civilization.Despite my language I am treating all involved as legal adults to abstract away form the different norms applied to liability for minor children.I am leaving out the complicating matter of strict liability offenses which by statute make even unknowingly involved parties liable for the purposes of creating a deterrent effect.,whatif,cel52ni,2,t5_2qyyc

1364186,0,t3_29n1u3,Im going to shoot for a neutral analysis of the possibility and no Im not sticking just to politics. The ripples from an event like this would effect the ways of life for entire populations. There would have to be more limits. For example if its an expendable resource like jet fuel costs it would drive you to take as little luggage as possible on the trip. So the rich and powerful would leave their fancy mansions bunkers and all unnecessary worldly goods in the current timeline. This would destroy property values create a serious culture of scavenging and squatting as the legal system tried to figure out who owned what. Some places would see such rapid nomadic movement and population shifting that local governments wouldnt be able to handle the random exodus events and have to focus on just maintaining local services as best as possible. You dont need government representatives when you can just reach out and take what you want with little recourse.Suddenly you would have a slightly smaller population with access to a much larger supply of luxury resources which would be denied to the general public. You would very likely see a lot of underground bartering with the trading of these salvaged goods. Now Im not suggesting society would collapse... Im suggesting people would adapt to the available excess. People would trade up especially from the remaining middle class if they got their act together fast enough. They would have the resources to hold the property and goods although the lowest class would have the most tenacity driven by currently unfulfilled worldly needs like food and shelter. Criminals would also have a strong shot at getting a piece of this action although the cripple depression holding much of the world hostage with drug use would fade as individual people realized their lives werent as bleak as once before. It would be like a gold rush eventa lot of people would change their lives suddenly deciding to move off and get a piece of the action. This would empty out the poorest parts of the countries as people dispersed. This would further homogenize the culture of these countries within a few generations as the ethnic groups further mingled.It wouldnt effect the countryside very much but the heads of many large food conglomerates would suddenly have left as well as Clevel executives in companies like Monsanto. This would create power vacuums. With the loss of many political leaders court officials and such there would be very few high government officials to interfere or adjudicate ownership succession and so on... This would give time for currently existing farming coops and small independent federations of growers to firm up their control on the markets. It would also mean really cut throat companies with leaders who chose to ride out current day Earth would have the chance to seriously influence the population while everyone had their pants down.I suspect you would also see some very serious religious leanings in the direction of nonmaterial living in whiplash response to the sudden rampant availability of certain goods. Possibly even a widespread adoption of behaviors that involve living off the land and not seeking fortune. Assuming many of the higher Vatican officials disappeared the Catholic church would see a pretty serious power vacuum as well. Perhaps Buddhism would see some widespread adoption in the Western countries as its nonattachment beliefs jived well with the response to excess.Then... once the extra all ran out and people have to go back to making things for themselves and many companies were struggling to save their brands and product lines you would see a generation or two suffering from massive economic depression due to the struggle. However it would also be a time of aggressive innovation as many patents would be tied up in the overburdened court system losing much of their value due to being useless in litigation. I wouldnt be surprised if the governments cut their losses by invalidating the system to prevent it drawing too many vital resources from utiliitylike policies. Much taxation would shift from being decentralized to being very localized. You pay a road tax? It suddenly gets used to work on the roads. Its just easier to track in a smaller government that way.Teachers even at the best schools arent paid well enough to make this journey but assuming that the rich cherrypick some for their households it would still leave a massive glut of teaching staff spread through the population. Plus with the ready available of Internet gadgets and the chaos in peering arrangements etc that next generation would be very well educated by some very aggressive people trying to keep the system from failing. They would inherit the roles of the politicians CEOs etc as they age along. They might even go back to understanding ethics as more than something they can rationalize. But admittedly Im projecting my own hopes there.This is the point where it gets either darker or lighter... Lighter People enter a new global Renaissance as innovation picks up pace and we adapt. Its the thing humans are best at. We overcome obstacles.Darker The excess has made people lazy and a resource war starts between the nouveau riche and their more populous neighbors who have had a taste of freedom from autocracy. Localized isolationism may cause a lot of people to pull inside walls as it were and the gaps between cities may be enough to keep people from traveling. If they pulled in you may see a return to very geographically biased beliefs of superiority. But if the Internet were still spread enough you may see larger confederations with names we know today as countriestldr Politics are complicated you have to look at the environment in which the politics develop. If you create a power vacuum you get a power vacuum. How people fill the various societal vacuums is what will determine your outcomes.,whatif,cinagj7,1,t5_2qyyc

The body organochemistry would have to be radically different  two hormonal cycles overlapping in current bodies is a sure guarantee for cancer in a few years. But yes the new species would have sexual urges and would act on those sexual urges. Staunch Heterosexuals would be in fierce denial and many would seek corrective surgery and hormonal suppressant to return to their old states. Most people would however adapt. The sadness would be for people who are unattractive. Everyone would be fucking with everybody except with them. There would quickly evolve new sexual gender archetypes. Sex would suddenly become a vicious supplydemand market and that would seriously affect the economy. There would be many divorces and more impromptu relations based on very casual urges. Note that with advances in science and technology it is possible we could be there everyone who wants to becoming a engineering pick amp choose hermaphrodite somewhere this century. Eventually these kosmetic modifications would also include rejuvenation beautification neurological adjustment.  This would introduce massive pathologies such as domesticated docilized wirehead sex slaves who actually desire their state and that sort of excess. In Western modern cultures this would already be bad but in certain Islamic cultures it would quickly become normative for women and concubines to be subjected to these treatments involuntarily.
