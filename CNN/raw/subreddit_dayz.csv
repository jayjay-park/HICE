18,0,t1_ceefo8m,there you go calling it a game again.seriously stop calling it a game if you cant distinguish between its actual purpose and that of a fully finished game.  Its an alpha.Its the first testing version of the software.  Normally this version is completely inaccessible to the public and is worked on only internally by whichever developer the project belongs to.  It  is going to by buggy glitchy and most likely wont even work in the specific features it is intended to test.  This alpha in particular is supposed to focus on the new inventory system and enterable buildings is my understanding... hence the  types of guns and  zombies per town.Alpha was only released so that the public could participate in the testing and rocket has said that its currently not even at the point where the public can really even aid in that respect.Lets put it this way lets say Pokemon was released in an alpha version.  You might be able to battle trainers and wild pokemon but you would have no way to catch more pokemon and no way to learn new moves.  So you might say so im losing interest and starting to wonder what is the point?  The point is youre testing an alpha build.so please stop complaining.  Its not a game yet. Its the very first testing version.,dayz,ceefvot,3,t5_2ty3s

3172,0,t1_cee41f9,gtSince when Czech Republic  Russia? DWhile the developers are of Czech origin  the game takes place in somewhere where Cyrillic script is usedCzech language uses latin script for that reason and because Czech Republic is landlocked I dont think is takes place there. We need to find a place where they use cyrillic alphabet and have a sea shore.Also the names of the places are mostly of Slavic origin that excludes Russian excolonies in Middle East.That lefts us Russia Ukraine Montenegro Bosnia and Bulgaria. Montenegro and Bosnia use Glorious Serbian Cyrillic Alphabet. Which is not the one used in the game. While Russia and Ukraine use the script inspired in Bulgarian one.Also Ukrainian language uses some is and s which are not present in the map however southern Ukraine is mostly Russian speaking. So the real world possibilities for Chernorus location based on evidence are Black Sea regions of Bulgaria Russia and Ukraine. However the developers of the original Arma II map could have inspired in any region in Eastern Europe with sea or just a land portion with sea added later and then added Cyrillic for better exotic ambient.I personally like to think about Crimean Peninsula when I play the game.,dayz,ceesrvu,1,t5_2ty3s

You cant change servers in real life you shouldnt be able to do it in the game. Infinite stamina. Your character should get tired depending on the weight of his backpack. Disconnection. You cant disconnect in real life. If you leave the game your character should still be in the game. Characters should sleep at least  hours a day too. Doing anything else while playing. People chatting on Steam or eating while camping to snipe people it breaks my immersion. There should be a spyware installed with the game that can check if youre playing if youre doing something else you should be banned. Zombies. Theyre not realistic they should be removed from the game too. If you get sick in the game you should get sick in real life. If your character is injured or die then you should too. Everything should be written in cyrilic. Books magazines cans. And if someone doesnt speak a eastern European language he should get banned of course. Before playing the game someone working for Bohemia should go to your house take your measurements record your walking running shooting etc. animations and put them in the game for your character only.

24464,0,t3_1ueevp,Not really. its not like you found a factory fresh MMosinFNX etc. These weapons are possibly damaged dropped by other survivors Before DayZ. They most likely took the magazine with them since its interchangeable with other weapons in the family.For example... I am holed up in a building and my stock is damaged.

37402,0,t1_ceik6n1,In conjunction I think there should be sound and animation that goes with the logging out cycle. So your character makes an audible sigh and removes the magazinebullets in your current weapon.  Having some audio cue would alert players you arehave disconnected and would help team mates know you are leaving and alert hostiles of what you are doing.  You should also not be able to interact with your inventory or perform any actions without canceling the log out. I think that having a tell that this is happening would promote people trying to survive the situation instead of raising the white flag and hopping they cant be found in  seconds.  Plus this just keeps people from instantly disappearing.Edit Wow I didnt realize this idea would be so unfavorable.,dayz,ceiou1d,2,t5_2ty3s

Started getting potshots at me tried to run away and some guy ran up to me to try and mug me with his friends. I mightve reacted too quickly cause I thought he was alone and was just getting shot at so I emptied the mag at him and he dropped me pretty quick. Was fully geared up after all. I probably missed every shot since that gun is zeroed wrong too... Then he kept calling me a son of a bitch over mic for fucking with him. I REALLY wish dead people could communicate with living.

There are lots of ways to estimate distances without any external tools as you say but these will continue to go ignored if people have a solution that doesnt require thinking.People are upset about this kind of thing not because they personally would find it useful but because it sends the wrong message to new players about how the developers intend the game to be played. We like to play DayZ because its challenging. Its not about taking the easy way out. Tools like this are one of the easy ways out. Why bother finding and carrying pieces of a map when the whole thing with satellite imagery is available online showing you where you can find loot and letting you instantly get exact distances?

78415,0,t1_cenckx9,Its neither. I could simply have said nothing or I could have said its not going to happen. What Im trying to do is to explain the difference between movies and video games in this case in sound development.This is area that is very poorly understood even within the video games industry itself which is why sound often sucks so bad in games.It is because people assume that making sounds for a game is the samesimilar to the process for this video... thus... if someone can do it relatively easy then it should be reasonably straightforward for a video game. Hence studios hire the same kind of people and things dont work out.The process is entirely different and generally Ive found movie sound people almost entirely unsuitable for video game sound work. The process is very different and generating the sounds themselves is often the easiest part of the whole process. You require a very skilled team with cross discipline skills in programming design and audio creation.I dont know what the result will be because we dont have a highlevel functioning team capable of what I expect in that regard yet.

After playing DayZ for over a year now and teaming up with countless people Id say there was only about a  chance the straggler would turn against you guys. Once you put more hours into the game youll realize its a HUGE advantage to travel  play with as many people as possible grouped together. Chances are if you hadnt killed the guy for no reason youd have eventually given your skype to him and youd have him backing you up each time you played. But instead you taught a fresh spawn not to trust anyone and more than likely to attack those who seem friendly before they attack you. And thats how DayZ COD was made.,dayz,cenfgbg,1,t5_2ty3s

110170,0,t1_ceqd1n3,TLDR physical changes to characters depending on amount of killing posture movement face will give good players more chance to identify each other and bandits which will lead to less unnecessary deaths from paranoia or ignorance. As well as shaping characters visually the way the players actually see themselves I.E. menacing or upstanding.  LONG VERSION Reintroducing a way to visually identify whether a player has killed many or few people would be an amazing step in the right direction. It wont be a end all deterrent to KOS but it would make situations where two good players accidentally kill each other out of paranoia much less likely as they would have another tool to asure each other they have good intentions or one good player hailing another instead of hiding from them or shooting them to be safe. Similar to the scenario where two players with hero skin would run into each other in the DayZ mod. Combined with the option to dress your character in a more of less menacing way this would create a good spectrum of identifiers. Healthy looking tall standing player not wearing mask or all out military gear. Very likely to be friendly. Hunched over hollow eyed and fully geared player hiding their face running with heavy movements. Certainly dangerous. A combination of less bandit like gear but killerlike character appearance would mean a scenario like The Road where a good guy has needed to kill to defend himself. Approach with caution. This opens up the game for certain mind games as well like bandits dressing up a fresh spawn as a decoy but overall it gives more opportunity for good guys to both identify each other and oneminded bandits. Reversing the process by performing helpful actions like healing should also be there but not in a overpowering way. Also I think this would be a great way for players to get their characters to look more the way they want as a bandit surely would not mind their character looking more menacing as it only enhances the way they want to come across to others.  ,dayz,ceqz4rx,7,t5_2ty3s

Keep in mind a lot of people WILL want to kill you for fun as well judge the situation as you see fit.Other than that stick to the tree lineswalls of buildings and stay out of general line of sight and make sure you know have some buddies to play with to make it more fun.Good luck out there.,dayz,cerk481,2,t5_2ty3s

This basically means even people with above average PCs are getting bad frame rates because the game doesnt utilize their hardware very well.When the game becomes more optimized you would probably be able to run the game at a playable frame rate.

189541,0,t3_1w9qra,Just yesterday I had to take someone out. So I was watching over Berenzino from the treeline North West watching people kill and be killed. I watched one specifically as he looked like a lone wolf and was wearing a yellow raincoat. As the masked murderer cut down several people out of cold blood maybe he just wanted loot who knows.  He kept searching through Berenzino and I watched him like a hawk moving from tree to tree to track him and make my move. I was simply going to handcuff him and take his ammo and guns away from him and maybe some food for I was becoming a little hungry. Finally he started making his way up the houses North West of the hospital and I figured this was my best chance as he moved into a building to loot I strategically moved in for the hold up. As he searches more houses the closer I get to him I can hear his footsteps on the floor on the inside of the house. Last house to loot is coming up I better move into position. He moves in to loot I dont know if he heard me but as I turned the corner to go in the door behind him he turns around in the door. I yell at him to surrender and get down he doesnt comply and swings a shovel barely missing me. I pop off a shot at his feet  I yell again calm down get on the ground. He decide to turn this into a over my dead body situation and pulls out his revolver. At that point I had no choice but to put a few in his chest... He died before the poor soul could even fire a round. He did have some food to settle my pitted stomach. I never wanted to kill you just take away which you didnt deserve. ,dayz,cf01169,2,t5_2ty3s

190778,0,t1_cf063tn,ampampampHeres a bit from linked Wikipedia article about Cerne Abbas Giant  gtgtThe Cerne Abbas Giant is a hill figure near the village of Cerne Abbas in Dorset England. Made by a turfcut outline filled with chalk it depicts a large naked man with a substantial erect penis typically described as a giant wielding a club. The figure is listed as a scheduled monument in the United Kingdom and the site where he stands is owned by the National Trust.gtThe figure has been the subject of much study and speculation but its origin and age are unclear. It is often thought of as an ancient construction though the earliest mention of it dates to the late th century. Early antiquarians associated it on little evidence with a Saxon deity while other scholars sought to identify it with a Celtic British figure or the Roman Hercules or some syncretization of the two. Archaeological evidence that parts of the drawing have been lost over time strengthen the Hercules identification. However the lack of earlier descriptions leads modern scholars to conclude that ...

And if I get Novy spawn well I know immediately where I am.I find it contradictory to state that the reason an ingame map wont ever happen is because they want to preserve disorientation upon death. Im sorry but with  possible spawn points what disorientation are you referring to? There is no disorientation in this game. Maybe for the first  hours? Why do you think suicide silos exist?

223413,0,t1_cf332h7,While I like the idea of random player spawning I would prefer an increase in the zones that a player can spawn in. Also I do not think that all item spawns should be random because you need to provide people with an incentive to go to areas. I think that having hot spots for certain types of items makes the game interesting by providing destinations and reason for travel. In the real world things exist in areas that make sense. A military base would have much higher concentration of guns than a normal city block. I definitely think that there should always be a chance for nearly anything to spawn anywhere but the probabilities should not be the same across locations.,dayz,cf3w49o,0,t5_2ty3s
223486,0,t1_cf3w6om,Well what OP is saying is that your view turning and your weapon turning and aiming do not have to be one and the same.  You can get fluid movement with your camera with the mouse and have better feeling controls while still having the character lagging in terms of aiming weapons or changing running direction etc.  To me that sounds like the best of both worlds.I agree that it likely wont happen though.

223803,0,t1_cf3xcee,Honestly I often have to go for real life issues.  If I even think there is another player trailing me in these situations I go afk instead and I log when my priorities allow me. Ive actually died from doing this less than  o the time and in those instances I was either standing in the middle of a field or in the middle of a high traffic townairfield. My personal preference is actually to have characters tied to a single server and have their bodies never leave that server. That way you have to truly log in a safesecure location. There are plenty of them. ,dayz,cf3xpuo,1,t5_2ty3s
223967,0,t1_cf3y2on,The problem here is you are one out of thousands of players who have the same thought process.  Sure today that shack protected you but maybe tomorrow after your H loot run you go back there and when you log in later that night you realized you were killed by maybe some random stranger running by that you didnt see.

265540,0,t1_cf8a230,Maybe there are some basic fundamentals to game design that you arent aware of.Theres no need for shamblers. You dont need a special zombie to do the things you want to do. You can have invisible entities which you might name spawn points which activate   at the right interval and at the right rangeIn the mod the spawners would spawn zombies When the player was closer than m and the frequency of spawned zombies varied from patch to patch.  In my favorite version of the base mod they would actually deplete. So you could totally wipe out a town for a period of time which was nice considering how relentless they wereThey dont even need to be indoors.You can make them sizeless invisible and make it so absolutely nothing can interact with them.  In fact ALL games have HUNDREDS of invisible entities all around you!

This is awesome dont get me wrong I always knew DayZ deserved more players and attention. Im aware newcomers can have great suggestions too and buying into the alpha gives them as much right to post as anyone. The issue is a majority of them have been discussed countless times for the past  months. Hell most of it has been covered since August  when the standalone was announced.

It would simply be getting into a military base or stock or factory go in there and grap the shit. None is there to defend it homemade explosive to break in there is simple to make. Getting the guns is not dificulty at all at that stage. ALTHOUGH  what i meant was id like to see more zombiekilling efficient weapons. LOW caliber for simple headshots or alike instead of highpowered shot rifles with the porpuse of ripping flesh.

313817,0,t1_cfd8l71,Grenade  threadfishing line a tactic used in several conflicts dating back to WWII isnt realistic? This isnt Bear Grills sim dude. Its a post apocalyptic zombie survival game. Other humans ARE all deadly threats. Protection of possession is not uncommon. Most survival situations also would not include  person KoS deathmatch or a mythical monster outbreak that spreads virally and its a video game so.... Your element of realism argument is not only wrong it doesnt apply to a game that stars mythical monsters and is riddled with unrealistic elements to make it playable.The grenade can be made rare and hard to get.  per server only found on the body of a random military zombie at one of the  military bases. Make it take space and carry inherent risk to the trap owner by making detonation by being shot possible. On top of that having to decide between using the grenade as the weapon intended or making a trap. ,dayz,cfdao7o,1,t5_2ty3s

315542,0,t1_cfdgygk,What are you asking here? Yes you get punished for leaving a server to early and connecting to a server to soon after leaving a server to early. It does not determine the reason for leaving the server. It just knows you left. This is very necessary to slow downstop server hopping and combat logging issues as well as it helps with ghosting.  seconds is not very long. This gives you time to do other things such as plan your route in game check reddit for updates check twitter for updates. ,dayz,cfdh45i,3,t5_2ty3s

320861,0,t3_1xqelu,They sell it as early access to alpha test the game like many many other game companies.  If youre unclear on what alpha is...basically it is the earliest that the game can be playtested for quality assurance.  The next stages of development are Beta then Goldor finished.Unlike many other game companies who give huge incentivesi.e. bonus content to buy alpha or beta access  the Devs for Dayz are honest folk that want to have the happiest community possibleand they knew people would buy it anyways.  They know how important it is to respect and communicate with their player base.That means not trickingmisleading people in to purchasing before the official release the game.  They are just trying to ward off those ignorant of what early access means.  Mainly they dont want people that are just going to bash the alpha for not being a completed game.  btwBUY DAYZ NOW!  Trust brutha you really dont want to wait.  Rocket has said they will not be lowering the price and it will only go up when the game is released.   for the only simulationesk zombie survival MMO out there and its made by good people is pretty hard to beat.

I can sit in cherno and KNOW I will see a player in  minutes. I can sit up in Stary and there wont be any action for an hour. Why does that make any sense?

It occurs because lenses have a different refractive index for different wavelengths of light the dispersion of the lens. The refractive index decreases with increasing wavelength.gtChromatic aberration manifests itself as fringes of color along boundaries that separate dark and bright parts of the image because each color in the optical spectrum cannot be focused at a single common point. Since the focal length f of a lens is dependent on the refractive index n different wavelengths of light will be focused on different positions.gtgtImage from article iInteresting Lens optics | Achromatic lens | Reflecting telescope | Distortion optics uSilverStar can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcfehmu oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfehmu.

366551,1,t1_cfipxej,Nope doesnt make sense to me.You cannot implement things that reverse A without first implementing A.  You dont add the ability to fix a flat tire on a bike to the game before you implement getting a flat tire and you dont implement getting a flat tire before you implement the bike itself.  Thats the natural order of progression  Add getting wet then add ways of getting dry again.  What is the point of adding ways of getting dry before you could ever actually get wet.At best what I feel is being requested by OP is that the devs slow down or stop releasing experimental patches all together so that players never see any incremental step in the implementation of new ideas.  I for one think that is a terrible idea mostly because I prefer to play on the larger experimental servers and Im a selfish dick.,dayz,cfirb0q,-1,t5_2ty3s

Its only thirty seconds I highly doubt anyone would really run into your body whilst you log out in some thick trees or in a bush although it is possible it  more than likely wont happen if you log out somewhere safe and not a high traffic area.

I would much rather this happen then having crap like heart attacks and frivolous new item models.

410918,0,t3_1ysdow,I think whats causing panic is not really the fact that he plans to leave but his words about DayZ being a flawed concept. That makes people think and worry if it is a flawed concept then it will be a flawed game even after release. What will be flawed about it? Will the zombies never work as they should? Will there be something else constantly not working as it should?Its just kind of disappointing to keep following this game for so long keeping our hopes up investing money and trust in the early alpha and now reading from the most important person behind the project that the concept is flawed.,dayz,cfncw6o,2,t5_2ty3s

411683,0,t1_cfnf7cp,I have a serious question Rocket. I respect your decision and im confused as to why so many people think this means the game will cease development and so on. One thing though.When you say fundamentally flawed why is this? The only fundamental flaws I see with DayZ is a portion of the community itself. DayZ is the perfect platform for Emergent SurvivalPvPPvE gameplay but looking  content in this sub a fair majority of players are only interested in shit like NO PANTZ IN ELECTRO!! which I feel totally devalues the experience. The problem is its a sandbox. There isnt a right or wrong way to play and im sure Bohemia wont allow more hardcore things being put in place. When the game is played as intended its fucking incredible. Even the mod was for months. Grouping up bandits heroes trading awesome notes people find on players bodies or in the wilderness and so on. Sadly my biggest fear is that aspect is lost because more people seem interested in blasting music over direct chat acting like prepubescents on Habbo Hotel.I honestly think Private Hives will stop this though. Well they did for me on the mod well ran ones. ,dayz,cfnfqsp,37,t5_2ty3s

We are dealing with a game which was not supposed to have . million players this early if ever and a concept which BIS itself was weary of thus next to no budget or other assets seemed to have been given to the team until the smash release of the alpha. ,dayz,cfnl4o8,2,t5_2ty3s

The nice thing about Unity too is its really not to much of a difficulty to procedually generate terrain and map objects as well. The dead linger rust  sir youre being hunted are all using unity for open world.

435951,0,t3_1z2lj7,gt ...seen at least one title on there which was successfully kickstarted and is now using early access a bit cheeky if you ask me.For me this isnt really cheeky. Kickstarter is there to get your development off the ground and ensure you have a timeframe to actually get a finished product.If you know its going to take  year and  in costs to develop your game then you kickstart for that amount. Going to early access after a successful kickstarter isnt necessarily a defined next step but theres nothing wrong with doing so. I now have the funds to develop for a year and I know I will get a finished product at the end.If I went to early access without doing the kickstarter initially then I dont know that Ill be able to raise enough capital through sales to complete development.If an angel investor gave me  for development I could go to early access release. If a crowdinvestment like kickstarter gives me the funding I could go to early access. Kickstarter and early access serve two different purposes  theres nothing inherently wrong about using both assuming you use both correctly.gt I feel like the early success of the standalone has been to its current detriment. This has led to really great suggestions and bug submissions struggling to be heard over the clamour of the masses.Absolutely but conversely some suggestions have been heard and taken into consideration. If the game was not in early access currently what would we have? A list of suggestions with zero context for implementation  and no bug reports since noone is testing okay except for the normal internal testing.If we werent in early access those great suggestions being missed would still be missed  or they would never be suggested because noone has any idea of what is in game or not.gt DayZ due to its massive potential and a mostly rigid design shouldnt have taken advantage of an option it didnt need and I suspect the project lead didnt want.How do you know it didnt need it? The influx of funding has helped and will continue to help development. If we hadnt had such a successful early access release at least some of this would not have happened.In the latest Dev Blog Rocket states that they had just hired an entire team of people experienced in making hunting games in order to work on hunting within DayZ. If they hadnt had early access would they have still had the funding to do this?The rigid design of DayZ isnt as rigid as you may think. Hunting would have been in the game regardless  almost certainly  but would it have the depth that an experienced and dedicated team will hopefully provide? Probably not.More team members for dedicated parts of the development adds depth to the scope. The fundamentals of DayZ may not change but the intricacies that really make DayZ worth playing  they can scale up with the more funding that is available to the team.Whether it actually pans out that way still remains to be seen. We may get a lot of idiots suggesting ridiculous things but that would happen with or without the context of actually experiencing the game.Giving the team more money to do more with the game while they have the development time to do it? A definite plus in my books.,dayz,cfpy97s,2,t5_2ty3s

I was transformed from a survivor into a coldblooded murderer right before my own eyes... The Shadow Bandit was still at large.... And now the third survivor is most definitely thinking twice about my psychological mindset. He proposed we have a ceremony and I sacrifice my axe for my friends machete in remembrance of his shortlived innocent life. As I unequip the axe and accept the machete the third survivor equips the truth. A Pristine Dallas Mask and the splitting axe that had taken the life of a friend. He turned to me revealing that he all along was the The Shadow Bandit! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA IT WAS I ALL ALONG!!! Running for my life my mind racing I think... Why run? Do I deserve escape? Do I deserve a fresh start leaving the past? I knew the answer. With the innocent blood on my hands I must turn and face the monster that had created me. I must kill The Shadow Bandit or die trying.

You got it a little more spot on than I did I was just trying to make it as simple as possible with the knowledge and understanding of the situation I had at the time.StablePlayable framerate in the arma series is anything over . It used to be when Arma  came out quite a common occurrence to see framerates between  when running missions with hundred AI and twenty players. Until better hardware came out and the game benefitted from some better optimization with Operation Arrowhead.You just kind of learned to deal with it. Of course I have a much better comp now getting easy  frames in DayZ and Arma .,dayz,cfy4awf,2,t5_2ty3s

528520,0,t3_206c77,Youve got lots of responses already and their pointers are all great! Ill add first off that I think its excellent I really love the idea. I have three thoughts and I stress that these are very much personal opinions but I dont think theyve been covered At times the fadeouts are maybe a bit too fast for the music? This is very much a personal opinion though and I realise also that this is a workinprogress. Just think that the flow of the fade didnt match that of your overall music. Want to really compliment you on two particular shots the view from above as you cautiously enter a gated area at .s and obviously the running shot. Both of them are just right. Different people are giving thoughts on what you should and shouldnt include. I say do what you want. If you want to keep it fully artsy as it kind of is now do that. I dont think it needs any action in terms of zombies or other players  personally I enjoyed how everything was so underplayed understated. However if thats not what youre going for and this is just a stepping stone to something that has a bit more commotion then Im sure thatll look great too. Just dont feel under pressure to spice it up with your own tidying up it will work without having to add anything. The whole serenity vibe clashes so well with what we know to be the true DayZ meaning that when we see you entering that gated area with that overhead shot it creates a purely natural tension in the viewer who knows DayZ. You could try and try to create similar tension with hundreds or interactions and wouldnt get as close. Yea man that really fucking worked Im getting more impressed the more I type Ill stop soon I promise. To end my ramble if you had it in your head originally that this wasnt going to be all about action and interactions then Id encourage you to stick with your project!

552387,0,t3_20gp6z,Me and four of my friends had returned to Berezino after fighting in the countryside. Upon entering the cities construction district we happened upon a new spawn named Mau who we escorted to the top of the construction site.There we interrogated him all in good fun and gave him a run through with our group titled the Berezino Policerino. Although Mau was extremely complaint some of the more impulsive of my friends suggested a way execution. After this we hung out on top of the construction site planning our next moves when we spotted  wellgeared players running along the road near the coast. We fire the first shots. At first it is suspenseful with only a few potshots to keep the pressure on. Eventually a couple of us move up to the orchard between the construction site and the ocean which is extremely hard to see inside. Eventually this all out clan war is joined by random new spawns audaciously running into the field of battle to grab any gear they can off of dead bodies and join in the fight. This utter chaos this giant battle between a fortified construction site and the dense orchard with heartpounding moments every other moment makes this game worth it for me. I thought someone would appreciate the stories that bring joy to others.  ,dayz,cg32a81,1,t5_2ty3s

598444,0,t3_20ze3l,I kinda fixed it like this. In control panel mouse settings make sure pointer speed is on the th notch the middle one. This gives you a  ratio which is desirable this applies to all games. In control panel mouse settings make sure Enhance pointer precision isnt selected. again usefull for all games. Win   and . mouse acceleration smoothing and deceleration fix   if you use a monitor dpi greater than  ensure you select the correct reg file this will disable acceleration in windows itself and anything which falls back to these settings.. I actually use a polling rate of Hz but with the dpi set to  higher dpi values introduce the quirks with faster movements while using a gun.Hopefully the fixes coming will allow me to raise dpi a bit without introducing weirdness this will allow me to navigate the inventory a bit faster,dayz,cg8aoun,1,t5_2ty3s

It feels a bit too random but now i know and ill be prepared so soon also these PCP zeds will be no problem anymore.Still it reminded me at the frustration of the mod.

I found the Morphine and booked it out of town on the outskirts I go to pull out my Compass and take a bearing only to realize I swapped the Morphine for my compass in my haste. I figure fuckit I know my way around this map. About  minutes later Im telling my buddy Okay I can see the town be there in a minute. I trot up to the sign outside of town just to be sure.....

Must not give information about cause of death.  Must not give information about location of death.  Must not give information about players killed.  Thats pretty much it.  Everything else such as Bullets fired or zombies killed would be awesome as it gives information about your deceased character without giving information that you could pass to your group on Teamspeak and that could potentially change something after youve already died.  What I meant in terms of realism which I really didnt think I would have to explain is that you can not pass information on once dead not the actual collection of information.

No biggie next time you play you now have to run  more hours to play with them. I know this wont be that big of a problem when we have vehicles.

One there is no good place to securely mount it. Two the ejected brass would hit the scope.The PU has a sidemount so it can be securely attached and it is also short in length and can be attached far back so brass will not hit it.The real question is why are we not able to put long range scopes on the MA?

741202,0,t3_22nfqb,Personally I would like to see DayZ become heavily oriented around players interacting with each other. I would like to see significantly less high powered weapons in the game. I would like to see a lot more pistols and shotguns and most of all melee weapons.I would like to see a DayZ where you are likely to run into another player most places on the map and guaranteed to be near someone in the main cities.I want more incentive for players to group up. Blood and Saline bags are a start but there could definitely be more. Maybe in the future more aggressive zombies would encourage players to group up to fight them off.I would like to see a DayZ full of memorable experiences. Bandits holding me up strangers offering to help meeting up with some new friends and heroically avenging their death when someone else comes along and decides he wants their backpack.I just dont see slowly crawling through fields to avoid zombie detection and waiting out my days in the forest as a lone survivor as being all that fun.,dayz,cgoj2wx,1,t5_2ty3s

758868,0,t3_22rjey,Most things have been said already. But I still want to add my  cents.What I like  Drag and Drop its easy but there still could be a few tweaks  Vicinity even though you sometimes cant access loot on top of shelves or something like thatWhat I dont like   Containers inside of Containers. It just does not make sense I think the function of containers should be to minimize the damage so people put stuff in containers they really dont want to get damaged   the very complicated way of doing simple tasks so you have to drop things on the ground because you dont have space in your inventory to do a certain task while in real life you would just use your hands to do that task  I know it sounds complicated its just because I dont have an example right now. I hope you still know what I mean   the long animations that dont look even that good no use of the player avatar in the middle   I think the layout of the inventory is improveable   the size of a few things and the fact that you cant stack them   unimportant objects like soda cans getting in your hotbar and get ghosted after usage i think they fixed that in experimental  the fact that you have to scroll sometimes to put something somewhere and you just cant scollWhat I would add   Weight which affects the speed and energy of a player   Being able to carry another backpack in your hands while not being able to sprint and hold twohanded objects   More animations for accessing objects for example taking out a compass out of your pants pocket when its stored there   backpacks getting wider depending how much things they store   carbines  hooks on pants  backpacks for easier faster access It also would be visible from third person when something is hanging on the side of your backpack also objects sticking out of your backpack   maybe more sounds for the objects inside of a container i.e. if you have a lot of loose ammo in your backpack in jingles while you run there should be a way of reducing that noise for example by keeping ammo in the boxes   carrying a second gun on your shoulder just like in The Last Of Us  of course it makes you slower and tired faster   more types of containers such as normal courier bags utility belts double pistol holsters leg holsters carbines and hooks   Maybe only maybe an animation when accessing the backpack also like in TLoU  it could be exploitet though for example when you hold somebody up and then access your backpack he uses that to attack you  you could also just add an zipopen and zipclose soundWhat I would change   More shapes for a tetris like experience Lshape for pistols   being able to turn shapes around  degrees   more fluent animations   a better layout no more scrolling   a better usage of the avatar and  or indicating hunger thirst wet sick healthy and fractured as symbols in the HUD which are able to be turned of just as the hotbar   seperated grids for seperated pockets   fall damage ruining pants and objects inside of it  it should be abolished or at least make the loot take less damage   smaller grids a little blood test kit taking up one whole square?EditNew to reddit I have problems with formatting so it seems.,dayz,cgqjg3u,2,t5_2ty3s

I beat them off but one of them finds a gun a shot whizzes over my head I duck and fire back with my sidearm. He drops but the some of them are back with the weapons they could scavenge. They heavily damage my armor I manage to kill a few more but one of them is behind me with a pipe wrench my helmet is badly damaged he clubs me and I drop for a second but get back up in that time they are all over me my armor is nearly done for I pull my sidearm and manage to get off a few shots  I get beaten down to the ground again this time I cant get up.

806926,0,t1_cgvxp6e,But are you certain theyre allocating resources in the best way?Sure there are different people for different tasks. And the company can presumably only pay X number of people to work on the game.So why not divert resources away from cosmetic changes and focus them instead on the major issues still seriously holding the game back?I may not know a lot about game development but I do know project management. If some of the major components of my project are still lacking Im not going to keep paying a person to make the PowerPoint look pretty. Im going to get someone who can fix the major issues and worry about the cosmetics later.And cant we agree that there are priorities here? Arent the zombies the top priority when youre making a zombie game? By all means the sign should be reported but I certainly hope it would go to the bottom of their list of priorities. I dont really expect anyone to agree with me but I dont think BohemiaRocketwhoever the hell is even running the project at this point have managed it well. The development is sluggish even after the influx of revenue with the release of the standalone. Major issues go unfixed. Development updates are nominal and infrequent. The only actual progress being made seems to be on cosmetic items. So yeah Ill complain that they havent fixed the zombies but theyve added hats.

So you dont value your life and you dont care if you die. So you pick people off for the fuck of it. For example got fully kitted at balota once. Got bored started playing more Yolo like. One time went to the NWAF and get the same amount of kitting I did at balota. Valued my life more. ,dayz,cgzfy3p,1,t5_2ty3s

As long as there is a way to postpone the infection or prevent it in some way of course Didnt read all of your post but adding this would make groups a lot more cautious of their other members. For example there was a couple of zombies that ran and hitbit one of their players. There would be a chance that he could be infected and there could be a chance that he is fine. The other members would be wary of him if he continues with them without telling them anything. But if he did tell them that he was infected what would the group do? Kill him before he turns? Or help find something to treat the infection. But what if he said nothing what if he turns whilst they are all in a room eatingresting? Also if a player does get infected make the time it takes for him to turn random. Sure it may just look good in text and not ingame but thats no reason not to text it first.

He Im coming in friendly put down your weapin Me I dont trust you Leave NOW Im on top lie and can see if you try anything start running and we wont have a problem. He is silent and starts running behind the house behind the spot were I am standing under the stairs. Then he breaks out in a frantic shoutlaugh helooooooo hellooooo FRIDELY FRIENDLY FRIENDLY HIIHAHAHAHHA. Silence for a few seconds and then now you die bitch bam. I think he somehow glitched his weapon via d person through the wall or something because he shouldnt have been able to hit me under the stairs like that... I dont trust people in dayz.

924357,0,t1_ch9by4u,gt No it very obviously does not. Nobody is confined anywhere. You can go anywhere you want with the use of this magical and wonderful device called the W key. It will take you wherever you want to go. Give it a shot I promise. It works really well.Im well aware how to navigate the map you stupid fuck but having spawn points in just the NE part of the map makes spawning boring and encourages KoS deathmatch playstyles which in turn makes the NE a haven for bandits. This in turn means that new spawns will find it hard to gear and survive plus with constant onslaught of bandits reduces the chances of getting inland. gtPeople not wanting to explore the map has nothing to do with spawn points. People dont want to explore the map because theres nothing to fucking find. If you want people to fan out and explore the map get on Dean to implement vehicles highervalue loot spawns base building player storage and other things that would add ANY value beyond sight seeing to walking around Chernarus. Once youve seen the map a dozen times like I have theres absolutely no point whatsoever to exploring it again. Ive seen it all before and theres nothing new to find.THATS the problem. Not spawn points.There isnt anything to find anywhere mainly due to the fact there are no features. That still doesnt excuse your shitty attempt to justify that spawn points the way they are now. Player interactions have always and probably will always be the best part of this game. If that is most likely to happen in NE part why bother exploring the map? Its a cluster fuck.gtWhy would I suggest anything? They are fine.No they are not. Accept this and we can all have a better time. For someone who claims to have seen the map you seem to be pretty fucking out of touch with the potential of what new spawn points can bring this game. Im not saying the game is perfect I wish Dean would hurry the fuck up and push out more features but until then more spawn points would go a long way. I get the feeling the reason you arent suggesting anything yourself is because you havent a clue of how to make this game better.  years down the fucking drain eh?,dayz,ch9cs53,1,t5_2ty3s

928708,0,t3_24r46d,The reason I made this straw poll is because I have seen a lot of discussion about how DayZ should switch to PP or stay the way it is. No one has taken a vote so here is our chance to do so.Personally I started off playing as PP but I enjoy the feel of PP much better due to it being more immersive. The problem with PP is that there is not a lot of people that play it. From what I understand from reading the discussion is that PP is not popular because it is on a hardcore server which scaresintimidates people which leads them to normal servers. This makes sense to me personally I would never start a game and go straight to the hardcore mode. I would play normal and then eventually make my way up. Hardcore to me is extremely misleading to new players.Im not saying one is better than the other this is simply to see what the community thinks.

933116,0,t1_chaaebm,gt Bohemia just bought up a complete studio of about  people to fix the zombies. Everyone should calm their fucking tits.  Its funny because the fact that they had to basically outsource the most basic fundamental mechanic in their game to another studio because they couldnt handle it themselves is exactly why Im scared shitless right now.gt Its not because theres one aspect of the game currently fucked that you can simply stop developement on all the other fronts and just throw every designer and programmer on the same task.This would be a more legitimate stance if we were seeing progress on both fronts. Everyone says the same thing every time someone complains about the pace of bug fixes or feature implementation. Its a different team! or Different people work on different things!Except where are the updates from these other teams? What have we gotten in the way of new core features gameplay mechanics or major bug fixes in the last few update cycles?If theres all these other teams working on all sorts of stuff why is update hyped up around a new type of camouflage or a new gun?If just once we would get a Tweet from the team that said Collision detection will function respectably in the next update! or When you press your hotkey your character will actually respond now! or Zombies are going to stop acting like transphasic retarded monkeys and actually appear to be part of the world now! or something that would give us a little bit of hope that the team is capable of something besides throwing a bunch of hats and shirts in the game and pretending like its a big accomplishment.I mean sticks spawn on the ground? Thats worth of a confirmation and a reddit post? An item that already exists now spawns somewhere else in the game? Thats a fucking  minute job by a junior designer  mark spawn points on the map adjust a few lines in the game files to instruct it to spawn items there and build.

952909,1,t1_chckxn4,Outdated engine?With the replacement of the whole renderer this means that the engine is completely different from its cousin not just in function but in its very rendering of the scene.We debated these issues earlier this year internally and decided that activity like replacing the renderer does not sound very exciting! and looking at bit multicore etc... while not exciting in terms of gameplay is the only way for us to secure the future.An example work has commenced on replacing the renderer. This could take quite a bit of time this year but at the very least would result in a complete rewrite of how the scene is managed on the client solving issues like FPS slowdown in cities and greatly improving client performance. At best it could result in DX opengl  ports which gives better performance especially on better cards and provides great options in the future for artists and graphics programmers to write new shaders.This is kind of like deciding whether to modernize old military hardware or simply buy new.

971650,0,t1_chehwej,When DayZ Standalone was originally announced Rocket had indicated the desire to see a release by the end of . source While not  years the total number of days between Wednesday August st  and Tuesday April st  is  days.This is equal to exactly  year and  months.As it currently stands in my opinion the DayZ mod is better and more playable than the Standalone. From a due diligence perspective we should look at the differences between the two. One has a team of paid employees working full time on it the other does not. One is using Arma  and the other a hybrid of AA. We should question why the engine is being reworked and what benefit it provides. Does it get us into diminishing returns  where we do  percent of the engine reworkbug fixes to get only  percent of the result in the vein of a reverse paretos law? It seems to me based on the glacial development pace with a stacked deck of resources Dean Hall has had a great idea  but isnt fit to lead a dev team again my opinion only.Ive logged hundreds upon hundreds of hours in the mod. The standalone? ish hours. Ive moved on to Breaking Point. It has beat Dayz at their own game functions properly and has pretty stunning zombies to boot.Related  a screenshot from my steam account showing BP gameplay BP have accomplished a ton of progress with no paid employees within th of the time as compared with DayZ SA. The game is fun as hell has hordes and tons of items and multiple maps. It looks better too  as it functions natively within the Arma engine instead of the hackjob hybrid AA engine. I believe using a hybrid engine on shaky code produces bugs like the kind were seeing in DayZ SA. Things that used to work in the mod no longer work for example.Dean Hall take notes.,dayz,cheqi9c,11,t5_2ty3s

These were the characters that died last night btw RIP or tense low geared pvp situations Oh and if youre wondering why his videos have big black bars he uses one of them fancy new ULTRA wide monitors. Must be nice to be single and have your whole paycheck go to fancy new toys instead of bills and the wife and the kids... grumble... LOL... sigh...small edit video playback disabled on other websites just click the links. Theyll play in youtube!Also dont let him know that I linked to some of his videos he doesnt think theyre very good. So... SHHH! As his older brother I think theyre fantastic. Lastly I really wish I could tell you guys which server we were on maybe our hostage is a young redditor idk... but were Goonsquad server regulars but last night our normal server only had about  people and we were really hoping for some player encounters after spending some time at the various military locations getting gear. Yes we were looking for a fight its fun. Ill check my server history and maybe figure out where we were playing. I may have embellished a few things for the sake of the story but the events as told are accurate. Thanks for reading! Nuther edit cause I think my brother and I have hilarious moments in game and I think people may be interested  in some of the stuff we do. Idk. Im probably just biased though.

Keep in mind that triple A titles often take around  years to develop and most dont let you get involved in the development and if they do its usually not until late in the beta phase.

1039864,0,t3_260h7e,The Dayz modmods are great fun. I like Epoch a lot. One of the problems with both Epoch and the mods in general is finding a good server. This is often timeconsuming and frustrating. The server needs to have good admins no cheaters the right settings a lot of servers gives you ton of stuff at the spawn and theres cars and choppers everywhere active players active players that is the same level as you. Its no fun playing on a server with  others thats all equipped like pros while youre running around with a makarov.Also every server is on its own hive meaning you start a new character every time you change server.Also if you think the zombies in SA is horrible the mod zombies are way worse!!,dayz,chmhjhk,3,t5_2ty3s

1106109,0,t1_chtyyd0,gt The Stand Alone has fewer features than even the mod  were missing functional zombies player storage vehicles cooking lighting options cold weather effects etc.Sorry should have quoted you the first time. The point I was trying to make saying that the team is working their asses off was that from what I have seen they are doing everything within their power to fulfill their promises and make DayZ a great game. One of the key points of evidence of this I see is their use of people outside the company to design specialized parts of the game i.e. hunting new zombie AI. Their action shows that they understand that they could not just create these new systems using the people already in the team and in the company which would have been much cheaper instead they seek out people who are experienced in that special niche.Some of this may be a reach but Im convinced that the teams efforts will yield fruit down the line even if it isnt immediately apparent. Ultimately it doesnt matter what the DayZ development looks like from the outside as we have zero power over it. I hope that the final release meets expectations but what I hope or think will happen has no bearing on what actually will.As an aside Id like to thank you for one of the few discussions on the alpha that didnt resort to name calling.,dayz,chu0six,1,t5_2ty3s

Really all its good for at the moment would be a quick two minute demo advertising a concept for a game that may be released several years down the road. I completely agree with OP. I dont want a campfire. I want to go the airfield and not have to worry about invisible people inside the walls. I want to be able to go places and not have to worry that the next time i spawn in Ill spawn in the sky and fall to my death. I want to be able to stand ten feet from a zombie facing the opposite direction of me and not get hit.Honestly selling people a broken game seems like scam especially when you have a game that stays is what is essentially prealpha for almost a year.

1135955,1,t1_chx5mpb,There really are two things going on here. People complain a lot about this game but honestly not without some reason. We all know it is alpha so lets leave that retort out please.The truth Making over  million in game sales before you have addressed a multitude of persistent gamebreaking bugs DOES have a significant impact on the project what those impacts are I dont know. I suspect that it removes urgency for fixing many of the aspects that make the game playable and attract interest. The motivation for an alpha that still has to produce a profit is much much different if you do not think this is true you have some flawed reasoning.That being said many of these issues are things that would normally be fixed in Beta not in Alpha. This game however from a PR standpoint has the disadvantage of already being a success and therefore will be subject to a lot of extra scrutiny.I am concerned with a lot of the nagging underlined bugs which I suspect the team cannot fix currently or they would have but at least they acknowledge and are attempting to fix the problems.Our only real move to wait and see what happens. ,dayz,chxeld3,4,t5_2ty3s

1156152,0,t1_chzf2si,No a bandit is a guy who robs people or kills them when in danger. The guy that sits on a hill and kills everyone that passes by is not a bandit but a homicidal maniac and a murderer. Spot the difference?The point is simple  interacting with others is way way harder than just shooting them but also way more rewarding. In fact its so much more rewarding that I think it brings the game to a whole new level. I used to be a bandit myself in the mod KOS but I decided to try and actually interact with people in SA.

Knowing that there are crazys out there that will kill you just for the sake of killing you creates this ever present fear that cant be found in other games that have strict rules.

1202401,0,t1_ci4v7x4,I think he makes a good point in some cases however. His job as a reviewer it to explain to people if they should spend their money on something or not. If he finds the bugs present in the betaalpha so debilitating that it is not worth the entry cost then he will advise players against purchasing it. If you treat the  price tag for dayz as claiming that you will receive software worth  like TB does you may be disappointed. However if you see it as a preorder for a  game which has the added bonus of allowing you to participate in incomplete builds one is much more likely to see the purchase as worth it.I would venture to say that TB would claim that because BohemiaRocket could stop support of this game at any point and not progress it further when you purchase this game for  you are declaring that the work in its current state is worth that amount at that moment. Due to the various bugs and what not one might claim that it is not worth  though and so should not be purchased regardless of future promises of additional content.,dayz,ci4vznm,1,t5_2ty3s

1255872,0,t1_ciavxwq,It surely does exist.  The mod had many of them.  But people get confused with the concept of private hives.  They think that people want private hives so you can spawn with gear have  helicopter crashes and  vehicles.Thats not the case for many.  I like OP want private hives to ensure that everyone playing on the server had to gear up under the same limitations and so that you cant ghost into areas or dilute the server with gear brought into or taken out of this one server.  It makes for a somewhat tight knit community because you end up investing in your character and you get to know those people who play that server.BMRF had one of the best private hives for hardcore players and it seemed everyone had a great time.  Often you would find yourself in a firefight with the same squad and it was fun to chat about on their forums.  With public hive you get randoms coming in from everywhere to grab loot and hop to the next server.,dayz,ciawfmf,1,t5_2ty3s
1255896,0,t1_ciap359,Thats fine.  Then stick to the public servers.  Some people want to play on the same server regardless of server pop.  Its about cultivating a character from a finite amount of loot.  You know that all the loot on the server originated there and will die there. Plus you become invested in the server and you get to know the community pretty well because theyve become invested too.  Its really awesome actually.

Finding a server that doesnt offer advantages for money right now in the mod is pretty much impossible and the same will happen with the SA when its fully developed.What we need is BI to stop being passive and finally add a proper reporting button. Too much reports and they would check the server for problems easy thing to do and if the abuse was confirmed they would unplug them from the hive so even though the server is still open to everyone it wont share any data with the hive anymore.,dayz,cidlijl,1,t5_2ty3s

But there would still be sway!! i belive they just need time to balance it for each item. Seeing that i do belive the developers said moast guns share the same sway at the moment.And i am to belive that the same sway that is in hipfire mode is simmilair to the one in aimed mode for the time being.So yeah fuck the people hating on the sway.

1358397,0,t1_cimi5g5,  I think what hes saying is a little different to your interpretation  what i interpreted was that zombies usually ruin stuff in your hoodie before other clothing  this is also my experience so i keep ammo in my pants as they tend to be least likely to be ruined when i take damage. I also get shot in the chest way more than legs  might all just be personal experience though rather than cold hard fact  I thought ballistic provided protection against one pistol shot? However what it doesnt do is protect from SHOCK damage i.e. being punched in the head. Motorcycle helmets provide the only decent protection from shock. But again i wear the nonprotective hats far more often because i want players to be willing to interact and i find wearing a helmet makes you appear less friendly  My first thought was that they would be for your friends  He didnt even consider that you might be about to go to Elektro!,dayz,cimkd0k,2,t5_2ty3s

1369670,0,t1_cinytb9,gt Yes yes I do. Many people here and in other posts point out how great barricading would be how awesome the idea is. Very few people mention that it would not be.  Thats cool.  Im fine with that.  I dont feel I represent the majority in my views of how barricading does or doesnt fit in the game...its just something that Im always thinking when someone posts about barricading so I thought Id put the conversation on the table.  gt Many people here and in other posts talk about how the best gamechanger would be a greatly increased amount power and capability to zeds and talk of hoards of zed running around.  gt If a significantly greater number of comments supporting concepts does not mean that many more people want and will accept that concept in game then I dont know what does.  Im basing my perspective of this particular issue on past history.  Anytime zombies are buffed a lot of people come to Reddit and the forums to complain about it.  DayZ mod just released .. which buffed zombies to a point in which you can no longer just run around town dodging them and run away to get away from them.  IMO its been a fantastic change for the mod because now zombies are something to be feared but sadly a lot of people are complaining about it and asking for them to be nerfed again.  Also I totally agree with you that a majority of players want the zombies to be more of a factor than they currently are but I do doubt that a majority will be happy if they are made so deadly that barricading becomes a necessary part of survival.  gt Also youre right I did replace some of your words with more emphatic words. Im trying to explain to you how you came across.  Again sorry if I came across that way.  I just dont see DayZ as a barricade type game since one of the core elements is movement across the map but Id love to see the day when barricading becomes necessary to survive looting a dangerous area like big cities or military bases.,dayz,cinz5uj,4,t5_2ty3s

1385696,0,t1_cipyqgn,some games require larger time investments than others. If you want instant gratification go play the mod where you can spawn fully kitted next to NWAF. dont cheat for items which you use to kill people who are actually trying to enjoy the scavenging aspect of DayZ. games like DayZ or any MMORPGtype game should force all players on a level playing field no questions asked. imagine if a game like WoW offered an option that allowed you to automatically grind and level up without actually having the game running. everyone would choose that option and nobody would play the actual game until they had a chance to PvP. even if a handful of people actually enjoyed playing the game properly theyd quickly switch over because of how often theyd be killed. people who loot farm on locked servers or server hop are the exact same. not only are they missing the main part of the game and the satisfaction of finding the items legitimately theyre ruining the game for people who choose to do just that. i dont understand this sub half the time they complain about guns being too common but theyll defend server hopping tooth and nail. ,dayz,cipz9p8,1,t5_2ty3s

Although sound is processed on a separate core it does not change much in terms of performance.

1453159,0,t1_ciyf12r,The thing is the entry requirements to alpha testing are complicated. There are entire books written on just this section of the software development life cycle transitioning from development phase to alpha testing phase. The ideal situation is to be feature complete.Now what you are finding is a bunch of links that describe what to expect when you are alpha testing bugs missing features missing documentation crashes etc. And I agree there will be missing features that is why I say it is virtually feature complete or very nearly feature complete. The links you are finding arent addressing the entry requirements to alpha testing phase.To understand the entry requirements for alpha testing you have to understand the purpose of alpha testing and the reality of software development.The purpose of alpha testing is to prepare a product for customer testing. It is frequently broken into two phases. There is an initial phase where developers of the software work on the alpha testing to get the product as stable as possible. You want to be as feature complete as possible when you enter the alpha phase because you are trying to test user scenarios. Then there is another phase typically called the alpha release where a QA team that is not privy to the internal functioning of the product perform the testing in a way that will approximate user testing.The reality of software development is you have  developers working on features. At some point they will start running out of work. When this happens you have them working on some end of development tasks. Eventually you wont have enough of the end of development tasks to occupy their time. Instead of paying them hr to twiddle their thumbs you start progressing into alpha testing. Sometimes there will still be a subset of the developers finishing up the last bit of features for the product but you cant delay alpha testing without your developers being underutilized and you hemorrhaging money. Thus alpha test is starting in a nearly feature complete state rather than the optimal feature complete state. You would typically predict this is going to happen and those missing features would be stubbed out with some placeholder functionality.,dayz,ciyfg0j,1,t5_2ty3s

You should always get your bearings first you will be surprised how long you can go without foodwater. Ive found that stealth doesnt really work at the moment. Zombies WILL see you even if you are crouching or prone. Stick to the general east of the map until you have a projectile weapon and some foodwater on you. Food has some uh surprising mechanics to it.    Ill give away one hint you see a cola on the floor but dont have the inventory space? You dont have the stuffed status? Drink it. More zombies that you are used to in this town you are visiting for the first time? It might be a good looting location good looting  triggerhappy players. Be careful.

As for adding this into the game I that that would be awesome but to a point I think it needs to keep simplified. Im sure a lot of CodDayZ players the ones who think its death match would bitch endlessly of the idea that you cant just magically put a scope on a gun without any mounting mechanism. Personally Id love it because for me.. The more realism the better.Edit But yeah totally. There should be a LRS scope. I guess they could rename the scope and give it a whole new mold. Its things like this that make me absolutely excited for DayZ to get out of Alpha. If they pay attention to detail like this and somehow make it so its not a death match it would be absolutely fantastic.,dayz,cj342su,1,t5_2ty3s

There will always be psychopaths its just a part for the game.  Putting value into your character will just make those encounters all the more adrenaline educing.  It would also open the door towards more classic banditry.  Characters dont want to lose their lives so they dont just try to make a break for it from bandits.  Bandits are less likely to kill on sight and youll have more occurrences of being robbed rather than being killed for your stuff.  Not that bandit behavior will change but how players react to bandits and KoS will.,dayz,cj432or,1,t5_2ty3s

1526034,0,t1_cj7hd2i,Being American and living near one of the highest crime rated cities in the country Spokane Washington I can see keeping at least a loaded mag but not in the gun or chambered. But maybe thats just a crazy gun toting Murican thing.That being said I can totally agree with people getting themselves out of situations where this should feel necessary. If you feel like you NEED to have this for safety then GTFO of where ever it is you live and settle down somewhere a little less dangerous. Too many people put themselves seems especially in this country in these situations and in all honesty it doesnt cost much to move even a town or two away to get to a safer place for yourself and your family.I know this from personal experience. When my daughter was born there was no way in hell I was living as close as I did to a ultra high crime city so I packed my shit and moved a few towns over where the crime rate is near nonexistent. People just need to think of a more intelligent way of freeing themselves from dangerous situations than just loading a gun for safety.EDIT Should add that I am one of the gun toting Muricans.

I said Ive never broken legs on a ladder stairs or other dumb stuff.  Ive jumped off buildings broke my legs on rocks fucking rocks ran off the edge of buildings fell off the stairs up high in a castle through my own action not a glitch.  However not only have I not broken my legs on stairs or a ladder Ive spent about half of the time playing with a group of from  people and no one Ive been playing with has ever broken legs on stairs or a ladder.  So I have .. lets say  hours of anecdotal experience.gt played the mod which it sounds like you have not.I have several thousand hours on the mod probably about  or so have been an admin or a mod on  different big name server organizations.  Ive lead two different dedicated groups  one in vanilla one in epoch and have been a commander in a group of ish actives  including the infrequent members of the group for about  months.  I have just a little experience in the mod along with  years of rpcmasterrace gaming.gt  I have shot kids and my firends have shot kids in the head and watch them leak blood from there face and have not died also same with the chest we have shot them twice with two different bullet holes leaking blood and walk away like nothing happened.Youre describing abuse not a mechanic of the game  unless youre using a brokendamaged gun and damaged ammo.gt You also can take one sentence from my paragraph and say this negates everythingListen.  If I said Everything that is orange is a sphere and a few minutes later showed you an orange cube youd agree that I negated my first statement in that action.  Maybe you miscommunicated you started off by saying spawns should be all in the NE because thats where everyone spends all their time then finished the paragraph describing how spawns should be all over the coast.  Meanwhile youre arguing that spawns are broken when theyve only recently begun to spread spawns inland.gt I also forgot about the game crashing which is also one of the worst things and if you say this has not happen to you you are an asshole who doesnt play dayzIve never had the game crash while I was actively playing.  I put some time in on most updates on experimental servers.  I havent played all the updates and took about  months off from playing DayZ at all between like February and May.  I have experienced the LMB bug and posted a link somewhere to my video evidence of it  which I used to file a BUG REPORT. Ive experienced where if you log off a server then try to refresh the server list the game crashes out.  But no not ever while playing not even when I first got the game in Alpha .x.  Maybe its because Im not playing on a shit computer or because Im a technician by trade and my system runs really well with significant customization to my OS and process priorities and loaded applications.  Maybe.However the game should ideally run on every computer that meets minimum spec even in Alpha.  See my post about shit presets that break the fucking game.gt HOW ABOUT YOU PULL YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOU ASS AND OPEN YOUR EYES. THERE ARE PROBLEMS THAT SOME OF US WANT FIXED AND ARE TRYING YOU HELP THE DEVS IMPROVE THE GAME. THIS WONT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF YOU AND THE REST OF THE PEOPLE WHO USE THE DUMB EXCUSE IT IS ALPHA I KNOW IT IS I AGREE TO THE TERMS EVERYDAY. HOW ABOUT YOU NOT COMMENT ON SHIT THAT IS TRYING THE HELP DEVELOP THE GAME AND START PLAYING MORE DAYZ SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SEEN.Your idea of giving suggestions and helping Devs improve the game is the whining rant your OP went on?  Seriously?Now first of all I addressed every point you made  clearly and accurately  and mentioned its Alpha once only to illustrate that you would not read anything I wrote and only see its a fucking Alpha on one line and then attack that like a dog after a bone.Thanks for proving my premise right.  Now if you really want to help the game develop you can do what I do.  I may not have  hours on the game but for every hour of play I have probably half an hour of bugerror reporting gathering screen shot evidence editing videos for evidence.  Case in point last night I played for  hours or so.  Did a bunch of dumb shit like threw every piece of everything I found that wasnt core to my survival to test the mechanics of ragdoll and test if thrown items could hurt people or zeds try throwing a lit propane stove at a zed.  Its interesting! Seriously.  I spent  hours after editing video and organizing screen shots so I can submit bug reports.TLDR Your post was whining a clear example of it.  It was not constructive and so clearly not an appeal for things to be fixed  but merely bitching about things that arent working to your ideal right now with a bunch of complaints thrown in.  At the least if that wasnt your intent learn to communicate more effectively because thats how you came across.,dayz,cj8h66z,2,t5_2ty3s

1537858,0,t3_2bu0sn,First off update everything via Steam.  ArmA  ArmA  OA and DayZ mod.  Then I recommend joining a vanilla server if you want the authentic DayZ mod experience.  A vanilla server is a server that has the original DayZ mod settings and does NOT add tons of extra vehicles weapon spawns and perks . of the private hives are set up like this.  The public hive database has gone offline for the time being so the public hive servers which for the most part are all on vanilla settings have gone down but some have come back up as private hives.  I highly recommend joining US  It runs on vanilla settings and has good population.  After checking out vanilla go ahead and try other submods like Overwatch and Epoch but they radically change the game with tons of added stuff that makes it much more like Grand Theft Auto than DayZ.  Good luck!  If you have any questions swing by our TeamSpeak at dayzknights.com and look for us in the DayZ rooms.,dayz,cj91n88,2,t5_2ty3s

1540736,0,t3_2bvnh3,The reloading sound on login was way better for stopping ghosters but they removed that and kept the timer. gtltIn the timers defense Rocket said it was more for stopping joininprogress impact on performance than stopping server hoppers per se but I dont think it has much of an effect.I hope they eventually add a real queuing system that happens outside of the game server like the HLSource system for waiting in line to join a server.

If I believe killing everyone I see even massacring fresh spawns and laughing in their faces is a way to play this game and its  okay doesnt mean its necessarily true nor wrong. Yet they think Im an asshole doing that. Im not necessarily an asshole just because thats what they believe. We cant talk about what is intended or what is not. Because nothing is intended regarding player behavior. However I can think KOS players are ruining the experience for everyone but the KOS players can think players who actually trying to be friendly or at least trying to interact with the player are ruining the experience for everyone or they just can think that these players are pussiesnoobsinsert something here. Neither of them are necessarily true due to the no rules gameplay Dayz offers. edit I hope you guys understand that I understand.

I love how the devs will comment all day long about other bugs features etc but never actually fully address and end this nonsense.  Wasnt the reason they built DayZ SA the way it isie server checks to prevent hackersscripters?  We are seeing videos like this more and more and it only encourages people to keep doing it and more to follow because its easy to do with no consequences.Stop telling people to play on hardcore serversfirst person.

Attacks like this are even sort of encouraged as long as certain guidelines are followed which we did as you can see by the comments by an admin on this reddit post Without the Green Mountain Sanctuary server this video would not have been possible so if you want to support and play the server all their informationlinks are below.Server IP ...Reddit TeamSpeak ts.gameservers.com,dayz,ck23ui8,2,t5_2ty3s

Number keys cycle through ANY item that you drag onto the hotbar at the bottom of screen. Some items will automatically assign themselves to your hotbar when you pick them up.  Simply click an item on the hotbar and drag and drop it off of the hotbar to remove it.gtKeep a spare pair of shoes in case they get wet or damaged. Not being able to run hinders your chance of survival. Shoes do not currently serve any function. Run barefoot if you like! However when . is pushed to stable on wednesday supposedly Wellies rubber boots may help to prevent you from getting soaking wet in the rain.gtIf the doors to a house are open the chances are it has already been looted. Look out for closed doors for optimal looting. Come patch . there is supposed to be a loot respawn mechanic that will alter just how true this tip is. Not sure exactly what to expect.gtIf you are armed dont kill a player that isnt unless they are trying to punch you. If you know that there are dead bodiesweapons potentially nearby youve been listening to a gun fight for example I would potentially rethink this one. Fresh spawns can become a serious threat very quickly.gtWhen you spawn you always face North. I dont believe this is true at present... However The sun is ALWAYS in the Southern sky and its almost always afternoonevening in the server. Its safe to work out your direction based on the sun being in the southwest sky no matter where you are on the map!gtIf you are neither hungry or thirsty your health regenerates. The more hydrated and full you are the quicker it regenerates. Getting yourself to bright Green on hunger and dark green on thirst is required for regenerating blood. Only when your blood is full will you begin to generate health.  As an aside dont bother to horde food.  Eat everything you see that isnt rotten.  Your fat reserves are immense and you can go a long time without eating if you make stuffing your face an initial priority.gtFor infected wound use Alcohol tinctureantibiotics Wounds dont currently become infected antibiotics arent used for anything yet.  Alchohol tincture however can be used to turn ruined rags into pristine rags. This can be done EVEN IF the alchohol tincure is ruined. gear gets ruined pretty easily in this game.

1892506,0,t1_ckh8d9n, I would be saying that DayZ was created in the Arma engine. We then played the mod for a year   years every single aspect of the game had been beta tested for a long long time they knew what we like didnt like what worked what didnt. Standalone Announced  year later still no game out so More mods get created we see Epoch with base building PvE servers with more zombies Overpoch with banks and safes. Any of these ideas could be implemented Standalone comes out in new engine has no cars no base building laggy zombies very bad FPS not much new some clothes? Nearly in  still in Alpha still no cars very few guns over complicated mechanics that hinder fun like drink every  seconds and eat ever  minute game still laggy buggy zombies dont work. Standalone is worse then dayz vanilla right now He hasnt built upon the new mods  and we literally have DayZ with some clothes a few new buildings laggy game broken zombies bad sound design STILL even after that video no vehicles nothing. Its worse then the mod that was created a long time ago. I expect a team to create a product that builds upon the past  years of experience with the mods not announce that it takes  third of the year to make a building. The game failed to meet expectations and has flopped. It sold on hype.  This subbreddit just defends it because they can accept the fact that the standalone is so shit. I can go on a mod right now build a base have a banking system do mission to earn gold and loot buy supplies survive. Or go on another mod spawn with nothing survive maybe fix a car travel to a risky area find a gun etc.  If I go on the standalone I get no FPS on my I K and  have no way of traveling need to find  map parts to even go anywhere propbably need  drinks then die to a buggy zombie.

1968245,0,t1_ckqd85s,Yeah DX should help a ton with the lighting issues. My thing is though that night time needs to be scary and atmospheric but also worth the time.  In the mod the nice thing about night time was that it made it much easier to avoid players and zombies especially if you had NV. Well since NV is out in SA and currently zombies arent really that dangerous there isnt much advantage to playing at night or any incentive. Especially with how poor it can look. But at least you can use lights without attracting attention from far away. With DX hopefully they can make night playable. Cause if they try and go full realism and make it pitch black and hard to see with out lights and then those lights can be seen from hundreds of meters why would anyone play at night? Where is the advantage or incentive? Maybe if zombies get dangerous that will help.,dayz,ckqdhwk,2,t5_2ty3s

You should not only install the game but actually PLAY it before telling nonsense.God this subreddit is filled with clueless fanboys not knowing what they are talking about.

Ive never designed a game no but cars arent exactly a recent thing to break into games not saying its a walk in the park but if a ps could accomplish putting them in their games I dont see how this is as mind blowing of a concept for a project like this.

But yea Dean Hall has more great ideas like  helicopter part where you have to server hop to find it. The community will work together to find it... Dont know where he said that... but he cleary shows that he must mean a different community... because this community only knows KOS for the most part..im really interessted to see the new renderer  and i hope they rework the network code. Where we come to the part why now? Thats something that should be done at the beginng of the project. That is a MAJOR part of the project. THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS!

2020449,0,t3_2httjl,The Piggy Back RiderThe one guy you play with who is usually not experienced at all doesnt know locations what gear is important the controls ect that tags along with you. Usually picks up gear like duct tape or more than one can opener fearing that one might break. Usually armed with an AKM or M and have tons of military gear because you the experienced player clears out entire towns takes down groups of bandits or find a secret camp site so he can just take the gear. The player just shoots everything that moves. When trying to be stealthy he generally just shoots  shots to get one zombie then another  to double tap. Tries to use military terms in incorrect situations like TANGO KIA MIA then expect you the experienced player to snipe in that general direction. The player does not help you in any way. Will not spot players animals only shoots zombies. One zombie is too much work and requires  rounds for him to take out or else he dies. In a firefight usually is the first to die and deal no damage to the enemy. Its like bringing a hamster to a zombie infested world. You have to feed it you have to protect it you have to dress it? and it does nothing in return but pretend to be some really amazing player. The Clumsy OneThe one guy who keeps dying in every situation usually resulting in the entire teams death. Things like jumping out of windows by accident or sniping while standing up because it gives you the best colorization  direction advantage Wtf is that?. Usually covers a door when looting then get distracted by the loot and leave. Or kill zombies with loud machine guns in the middle of a large town. A zombie will corner this player in the door way of a house kill him and have his body block the way out. The FPS MongerIts that one guy who does nothing but complain that the game lags too much and needs to be optimized. The one person in the group who will blame death on low fps lag desync netcode ect. Usually plays on a potato computer and is bewildered that the game doesnt work because he runs battlefield  on it at  fps. Hipster ModThe one guy who just talks and talks about how the mod was sooooo much better than the standalone and how the mod will always be better than the standalone. Complains about missing features bugs and then finish all the sentences with a mod was better. Usually all conversations are started with Back in the mod or Back in  or I remember when  was  back in the mod.The Greedy OneThis guy in the group is the one guy who wants to have all the loot and get all the first picks on loot. Usually will run blindly into a barrackairfield ect in hopes to get the best loot before the group. Usually saves everything for them self and never shares. Eats all the food regardless of other peoples hunger because I need it. This player generally runs blindly to get all the loot which has this player dying a lot. Ammo food drink clothing weapons ect are all hishers if they find it and no one elses. ,dayz,ckwnsi9,1,t5_2ty3s

2022699,0,t3_2hbbcz,Woooohooo alpha access in  week what is that...  weeks after the first expected alpha date? Why? Because the game has been in development for  months maybe.There is not a single good zombie open world MMO game on the market that is even half way complete... why? Because these things take a freaking long time to develop and add the depth that everyone expects.HZ is going to be BARE bones even by DayZs standard when its released with just as many bugs and issues. Yet the games end potential will be a FRACTION of DayZs in terms of realism authenticity and immersion. A big reason is the map Chernarus is like  years in the making and the map is literally  times the area of HZs world Thats assuming you trust their word on it reality is developers lie about world size more often than not. If youd like to play the baby of WarZ and Rust then be my guest. But the scale of DayZ cannot be matched by some slapped together FP game. Above all DayZ is going to have modding. ArmA games are the pinnacle of sand box because of the tools the community has to create their own games within a game. There will be  completely different versions of DayZ to fit almost everyones desire not to mention private hives that further build community and massively reduce exploiting.HZ last time I heard isnt even going to have permanent death?!

Quote correctly friend. it saves people the trouble.Also hes right the people who are in charge of clothing may not be on the same subteam in the development team but they do collaborate with the others a lot to put said clothes in game and it would be a good idea to focus more on the bugs rather than new clothes and buildings not saying its easy just something they should spend more time on being that they are important parts of the game.As far as a lot of people are concerned he is right they are dragging their feet. Bad. He brings up a few valid points there and people do have a very Circle Jerk kind of mentality with the game but you also have points that are valid too.You both need to just step back and stop talking. No one is going to win because youre both right in some instances. Just relax sit back have a smoketokedrinkwhatever floats your boat and move on.

2054904,0,t1_cl10jqj,I turn off every nonnecessary process including steam which seriously steals frames like a mofo and explorer.exe. I set DayZ.exe to high priority to prevent stuttering. I also give it admin access.If I can turn it off in game like shadows then I do.  I have also set the bios to have the fan at full blast constantly along with disabling nonneeded things like my track pad. I also set the rendering resolution at  which gives me a small boost without making things blurry. Despite what people say turning down textures can help if you dont have a full  gigs of ram I do but my OS steals some. Disabling grass also helps. And playing on low pop low ping servers really really helps more than anything as it can in some cases double your frames vs a full  player serverPlaying around with your settings can also help by balance your gpu and cpu workloads. The more time you spend adjusting the settings the more frames you are going to get. Also I cant do it on mine but have your friend check if he can overclock which can also really help.

That is exactly an issue of balancing.You have every right to say you think the game is too easy should be harder ask others for opinions etc.  But when someone rightly points out through a simple one sentence phrase that the novel youve written on the subject is a bit stupid because this isnt a finished product nor in anyway the final version the developers have in mind for the game dont act like a douche who somehow is being wronged because they voiced their opinion as well.

2077803,0,t1_cl3ruv9,Certain things have to be scaled down and up to make certain mechanics relevant.  If they made it  simulation it would never work as a game.  Think about it...how long is the average life in DayZ?  A couple hours maybe?  A lot of people live a few days...some a few weeks and the survival nuts last a few months.  If hunger was on a realistic time table the only group of people that would ever even have to worry about it is the last group.  The vast majority of players wouldnt even bother looking for food or ever need to eat because theyre going to die from PvP or zombies LONG before they even need to think about eating.  All the featuresmechanics involving food looting food finding can openers hunting cooking and eating would be rendered almost completely useless.  A great example of this is the mod.  It used to be that all you needed to traverse the entire map was a can of beans and a soda.  Nobody paid much attention to hunger or thirst at all.  The only time people would hunt for food is if they needed blood.  Now however hunger and thirst deplete much faster and canned fooddrinks dont do much for you.  People now actively hunt fish and boil water in the mod as a regular part of gameplay.  Features in the game such as hunting fishing making fire places cooking and boiling water went from being a side feature that hardly anyone used to being an integral part of the game that everybody uses now.Some things work great on a realistic time table.  I love the idea of a  hour daynight cycle its one of the things that made me really interested in playing DayZ mod.  Its great that when the sun sets its night time and you have to deal with it.  Some things however such as hunger and thirst work much better when scaled up or down from reality.,dayz,cl3xmva,6,t5_2ty3s

Broadcast over the walkie talkies once theyre working. Leave notes in places people will find them.

2207879,0,t1_clkevth,The problem is the server.  This would be fine in singleplayer.  A recent Arma  map Bornholm looks reminiscent of this with its prodigious amounts of clutter and eye candy.  It runs fantastic in the editor.  Then you add it to the server.  Instead of one client asking for one small section of the map you have  or  or  people asking for different sections.

2236034,0,t1_clo1fbv,these are indeed the quotes i was talking about especially that third one. eugene has  hours to his own credit over how long of a stretch that is idk but im going to assume its from the very beginning making his actual weekly playtime  hours a week making his playtime casual at best plus we dont know where he plays on what server and where in game. If i play in the north away from everyone on a high pop server of course im not going to run into a hacker my point being his anecdotal account has no bearing on the reality of the situation. even if that . number is accurate its out of k which is still a hefty number especially if they stick to the top five servers exclusively like ive been lead to believe. that whole comment rubs me the wrong way and appears to be a no big deal approach to something that seems like an exact repeat of what happened to the mod. we are repeating history almost month for month with regards to the mod. All this really doesnt matter anyway the bottom line is that the community right now is taking a reactive approach to hacking when there should be a proactive approach. i remember when the take the gear off a player hack was introduced and they said it was patched and wed never see that problem again here we are  months later and the same hack has reappeared albeit in a different light. not having the tools to preventmitigate things like this on our servers is the number one problem right now next to server performance. as soon as there data was hacked about a month ago they shouldve immediately started giving more power to the actual people affected by that hack the players. ,dayz,clo1xtz,0,t5_2ty3s

Yes you do some optimization at the end of the development mainly to fix mistakes that were made before and that didnt work out the way you wanted. The netcode is no isolated thing you cant just come back shortly before release do some netcode stuff and expect it to work the whole game has to be build around the netcode you planning has to include the netcode from the start.

Alternatively play the DayZ mod that of course inspired many mods with no restrictions given its nature as a popular mission built within the confines of ArmA. Play Its ArmA equivalent.

2329999,0,t1_clzp4pt,No i dont. The work that had to be done until today was mostly engine redevelopment. They stripped down the entrie Arma  engine and coded large parts of it from scratch to make their vision of the game possible at all. The thing with redeveloped engine modules is that you dont see them ingame before they are actually used and to use them they have to be finished.

Reply to the guy with facts about the posting.  unarchy said your photo is from Jan .gtIts on this website and listed as January . If thats the source DayTV were nice enough to chop off the watermark.Taking an old screenshot cropping it running a filter on it and adding an ambiguous caption... and then not being upfront about any of that making it seem like new screenshot related to vehicles like the ghillie suit pic when its just an old screenshot... that kind of behavior upsets your readers.

2375878,0,t1_cm5agib,I get what youre saying and completely I agree with a small asterisk  Loot tetris needs to go. It pulls you right out of any immersion. Frankly I hope they get rid of the mechanic altogether. Instead I hope for a system where clothing items add or subtract to your overall carrying capacity. I know its not a super popular idea here. People LOVE arguing over how loot tetris should work and the idea that the mechanic goes away would resolve too many internet fights. And you know we cant have that!Its early yet in the games development and in a year or so the UI will look and act much different anyway.,dayz,cm5d84o,0,t5_2ty3s

2397219,0,t3_2mv8yw,I find the repeaterrevolver ammo th most common ammo and it is usually loose rather than in the box.  My personal ranking for ammo abundance  Shotgun  .  .  ..  I have yet to see the . ACP in civilian locations dispute being used in the most amount of pistols.Anyway I have a similar story about last night fear and a night time experimental pp server.  I spawned at Solnichniy and ran inland because I knew coast cities are always looted. Stopped at Dolina my personal favorite little town. I am almost guaranteed to find a gun and matching ammo there because of the new police station across from the brick arch building as well as a good chance at the red  story and  short log cabins nearby always a gun or ammo hiding behind the fireplace and the bed.  I get to Dolina and I see two lights one a red flare in the  story cream colored house and a yellow chem light at one of the two brick restaurant mind you its a night time server so it looks nice.  I sneak around and watch for a while and not see anyone in town or in the buildings.  Knowing that someone has been in town within the past half hour I am very cautious.  I was surprised not to find any guns in the usual places in Dolina Police station and brick arch building.  But Dolina has come through again as I find  but I find a blaze double rifle in the short log cabin leaving town and  rounds of mosinblaze ammo earlier and a snap loader. I press on but go down the dirt road to Staroye instead of sticking to the paved road to Polana.  I find signs of people there too damaged rags rags have a uberlow spawn rate afaik damp spawn clothes mostly opened doors.  I sneak in the shadows and hug the walls I go to building to building. I practice my pie slicing as I enter each house keeping my gun at the ready.  I found a Makarov but no mags in police station.  I get through all of the town to the very end at another short log cabin.  I was about  feet from the door when I see someone running around inside.  I call out to him and to my surprise he is friendly we small talk let him use my machete to open cans and part ways.  I head over to the Sobors.  Novy Sobor is uneventful. I find fewer evidence of people being in the town but keep pie slicing good practice anyway.  Stary sobor was uneventful until I got to the edge of town next to the market.  Suddenly  repeater shots ring out on my end of town definitely nearby but not landing in my direction.  I tend to flight rather than fight.  Heart pounding I decide to fight my instincts to run and decide to try to find who shot those  shots and at what my guess is at a zombie missing horribly. Knowing that the market would probably be a looting destination especially with a broken military vehicle in front of it I dash between a nearby shed and a wall and watch the market.  Heart still pounding I wait.  For what seems like  minutes nothing happens. I decide I should move up to get a view down the main road to catch a glimpse of someone running in between houses.  I near the road and..... Red letter appear saying No message received in  seconds.  Saved by the server reset.  I run quickly down the main road hoping to see the unaware figure of this person I was trying to find.  My  second window closes and I return to the server screen. TLDR  Night time pp servers are scary.,dayz,cm805fh,3,t5_2ty3s

Here are a few suggestions and thoughts IntroOutro screen  Nice way to set the mood and explain the setting within seconds although it scrolls very stiff and doesnt look like a real broadcast screen. You could add more glitchnoisedistortion effects and maybe an old russian TV frame. Landscape zooms Another good idea to show a lot of the world within a short time. Visually sucks the viewer into the screen very dynamic and fun to watch! It would be even better if the camera motion was more continous through the scenes maybe just the center zoom motion or just sideviews. Try to use a better machinebetter settings next time the footage looks a bit weird. Cant wait until theres a new renderer  cinematic spectator camera in this game. Nightly encounters Very creepy and atmospheric! Although these dark shots completely break the atmosphere of the previous landscape shots. Feels like watching two different things. Maybe you should try to put the daylight shots together then have some sort of visual transition then dark shots. Overall I think it has a lot of potential for a really good DayZ Trailer but it still needs a lot of tweaking! Keep on practising man ,dayz,cmbns9q,2,t5_2ty3s

2448706,0,t1_cmebv1p,no the DayZ team doesnt understand what an alpha is.  Alpha is for testing your core ideas and implementations.What they released as alpha originally was just a stripped down version of the mod. It was still using mod code still using mod engine still using mod resources.  It was just a cash grab to fund their development team. Which is fine as long as they actually yknow develop from there.  What they did instead was try to frankenstein some shit from the Arma project into the take on helo engine while porting over the a dayz mod code.  This was understandably difficult and not worth the effort so they reverted all their plans and are starting over with a new engine.  The game is in development hell and both the original mod and the A mods that are similar but not close enough to get sued have far surpassed them in quality.The general shitlord attitude people have is largely due to this long series of bungled decisions and time delays. Having them also pile on a seriously questionable if not borderline illegal depending on location sale scam just lit the fuse.,dayz,cmed470,7,t5_2ty3s

2450418,0,t1_cmehnup,First thanks for the reply Im glad to see someone actually answer.  I guess part of my wanting to argue against being called an alpha apologist is simply that its got such a negative connotation but really I guess that is what were doing using it as a defense against bugs and issues. Personally I feel its a justified defense though not always.  The thing that bothers me the most is it seems as if a lot of issues or bugs get repeatedly thrown at the developers which doesnt really seem helpful. I definitely agree we can critique the game without hating it. Perhaps the degree to which it happens is overly done though to the point where it becomes obnoxious. Im sure we can all agree we dont want to see complaints over the same bug all over this subreddit all the time. When I picture useful feedback the way I picture it is kind of separated into either bugs or mechanics. Mechanics are worthy of discussion and we see that which is great. Bugs on the other hand I think dont need to be discussed so much theres a problem make the problem known then give the devs the chance to work on it discussion beyond that stops being useful and becomes an echo chamber because what is there to discuss beyond X isnt working as it should.  I wrote a lot more but decided it was quite the wall of text and sidetracked a fair amount and what it really all boiled down to was that I agree with you but that I think some people take it much too far and at that point the perspective is needed.,dayz,cmekpt3,1,t5_2ty3s

2452189,0,t1_cmeqnsf,Thank you. I am one of those people. My old computer I used on the mod which was already underpowered was murdered by the stand alone. So I usually just lurk and keep tabs on the development. I have been a gamer for a long time so it was really interesting experiencing a game so early in development. Upon having purchased an xb and enjoying the shitstorm that was the finalized launches of Battlefield  and the Master Chief collection it was refreshing to see rockets candid responses to the community here. It was just unfortunate to see how that all turned out. So much negativity in gaming. I see Conan OBrian reviewing a game and hes admittedly pretty terrible but he seems to be having so much fun. I try and have that much fun playing games. We really are in a great time for gamers but we can be incredibly cynical about our hobby. Seems like those that are genuinely enjoying games just spend their time playing games.

2475450,0,t3_2nveyy,The most important thing to edit in your DayZ.cfg. isGPUMaxFramesAheadGPUDetectedFramesAheadYou should test with it set at  and . You will see a VERY significant frame increase.Also the Terrain drop down selects the quality of the ground textures BELOW the grass clutter which is forced. You might as well turn it to low as it does give a bit of a boost and the ground textures are not exactly awesome anyway. FYI they could and have previously spoken about lowering the draw distance for clutter they have it at m like it was in A Cherno. Its a good way to leave head room in if its absolutely NEEDED after theyve optimized the client side which as theyve stated many times hasnt been done AT ALL yet.IMO forcing the clutter is important as it was one thing in the mod that was exploited by PVP centered players a LOT.The object qualityquantity thing could actually be fixed but its a huge projectPITA. The problem is that BI made very low res LODs for the buildings that have textures of a window instead of an actual window so you cant see through the nd LOD. I work on a Arma building project that goes through the buildings and fixes LOD issues and opens buildings that were closed.. thats something we make sure to do so that people can use low settings and not suffer.Hopefully the new renderermodel format does away with the low res lods or that theyre fixing them as they import them into the new format.,dayz,cmhofx6,1,t5_2ty3s

2476892,0,t1_cmhuvm6,Yes because a video game needs to have every single humanly possible method of ear protection. I imagine theyd pick a few different ones that vary in effectiveness  so a few strips on cloth cut from a shirt wouldnt do much but actual ear protection would be damn near perfect.The mechanic would provide players with more meaningful choices  cripple your situational awareness by using ear protection so you can use that big scary gun or forsake the sheer stopping power for something that has more tactical flexibility?Also the effect would not be zero  putting candle wax or cotton or whatthefuckever in your earswould obviously dampen your ability to hear somewhat. So sure you can use that big nasty scary fullauto heavy machine gun but you cant hear that one sneaky dude with a knife right behind you.

2494945,0,t1_cmjxs95,Thats not factual information at all.  Sure in WWII Russian snipers that were issued mosins had PU scopes and that was the only choice back then.  Since then there are modular rail systems that require no drilling at all allowing mosin owners to mount essentially any scope they want on their rifle.  Prior to those being available you could just drill and mount a scope regardless.  If anything the ONLY problem with mounting any scope on the mosin is actually the bolt lever.  You can not grab a PU scope or any other scope and just slap it on a mosin and expect the bolt to actually clear the scope.  This is evident if you look at one with a scope mounted on it as you will see the bolt lever is curved and often shortened vs a mosin that only has irons.Keep in mind Im not even getting into the Archangel style stocks available for mosins.  Those replace all of the wood parts on the rifle with synthetic materials prevent the need for either stripper clips or manually loading rounds through the top of the rifle adds mounting for any scope you want much like the cheaper method with the rail system mentioned before and also allows the rifle to accept magazines fed from the bottom.Edit  source... I regularly shoot a mosin  one of my best friends has  of them along with a mauser k in his collection of vintage rifles.  He has the rail system on one of them and a couple different optics setups that we have used with it.  Personally I find that a PU scope in real life is the most pleasing but you can essentially put anything you want on one so long as your bolt clears it.,dayz,cmk871z,0,t5_2ty3s

But after todays update Ive not had any notification so far in DayZ.,dayz,cmkf78q,3,t5_2ty3s
2496541,0,t3_2o6z1f,Wow amazing idea!This really adds to the morally grey experience that I love in games and that I hope is brought to DayZ to a greater extent. Killing some armed guy because he looked dangerous only to see pictures of him with his friends and helping out those in need with everyone looking happy would really help make you feel like shit reducing KOS to a possibly more realistic amount.DayZ does need a morally greying aspect. I mean hearing someones voice as you fire on them is a huge impact to most people as Ive surrendered in firefights in which I wounded me opponent only to go retrieve him medical supplies after we traded gear because he said something likeShit man! My friends unconscious stop firing! Why the hell did you fire on us?!Look Ill put my gun up lets be friendly.And then I proceed to holster my gun and begin bandaging his unconscious friend as he comes up the stairs to meet me. Its amazing when someone doesnt respond like a total jackass with death threats or insults after that event and seemingly are able to quickly identify that I was terrified in the situation. ,dayz,cmkfpln,15,t5_2ty3s

Nothing since has happened similar and I really miss it  It all ended because both groups got banned for doing something good. The lead developer DeathlyRage gave us  servers to run because everyone was complaining about the admins and owners and stuff. Because we didnt abuse people preferred our servers but the hosts of the original didnt like it so ordered Deathly to shut us down. He did and banned all of us and that was the end of Breaking point for us ,dayz,cmn3k3i,3,t5_2ty3s

2518313,0,t3_2oe0qa,Stay low.     Zombies have a harder time spotting you if you stay crouched. This can be frustrating at first due to the fact that you move slower but will help you avoid most of the dead. Head Inland Asap.     The Coast is where most Bambis spawn and the infamous bandits like to prowl. Big cities like Cherno Elektro and Berenzino are DANGEROUS. Beware those that enter these cities lots of Kos and PVP. Beginners Gear.     Your  starting clothes are limited in available storage capacity. keep an eye out for a sweater checkered shirt and bigger pants these have more storage and are fairly easily found in most towns. once a better top is found tear up your starting shirt for rags bandages. Kids Backpacks and the Talon pack can be found in most towns. A knife or any sharp object can be used to open canned food until you can find a Can Opener. Find and keep a Water Bottle till you can upgrade it to a Canteen. Matches rope sewingleather Kits and a compass are must haves. The kits will keep your gear in good condition and can be used to patch up wounds if no bandages are on hand. Rope can be used to make a Pack with a burlap sack and can be used with a ash wood stick to make a Bow. Weapons.     You start with your trusty Steel fists of fury but should try and upgrade as fast as possible. Axes are harder to find now but are the best Melee weapons. Sledgehammers farming hoes pickaxes brass knuckles will get the job done and can be found fairly easily. Firearms are harder to find now but even without ammo they make you look threatening and you are more likely to be shot while holding one. I will always leave a gun behind if I dont have the Ammo for it first. Though I have managed to hold a few people up with a empty gun.Food and Drink.      You can search apple trees and some bushes for apples and berries if in a tough spot but these can be life savers. Blue Berries are Poisonous Red are Edible. You can drink from any water source pond creek or fountain to get Hydrated. You can also hunt for food Cows deer sheep and boars will provide steaks but need to be cooked on a fire or gas stove first.Never Trust ANYONE.    Never turn your back on a new spawn or armed player. EVER. DayZ currently is full of dickheads trolls and plain malicious bastards with a few true Heroes tossed in to keep you guessing. I always speak first and shot second. If I have the drop on somebody I will make contact saying Hey buddy you friendly? If they raise or equip a gun before answering I am more than likely going to shoot said person if I dont have cover. If I am in a safe spot and they have no idea where I am I ask that they put their gun on their back or drop it. If they comply they live.They Cant shoot what they cant see.     Avoid running through open fields or Roads whenever possible. Stick to cover tree lines low hills walls n such will go a long way to keeping you alive. Dont stand about in the middle of towns. Keep your head on the swivel when traveling stopping occasionally to check to see if you are being followed.Im sure I am forgetting some things but I hope this helps. ,dayz,cmna5so,2,t5_2ty3s

2586261,0,t3_2pdvvf,Personally the main things that would promote interaction are.  Add value to your character for surviving  ie slightly better levels and rates of recovery for health blood hunger thirst cold disease tolerance over time though very against combat relating level advancement.   If a character has more value than gear people will be much more risk averse..  Make permadeath real as in you cant respawn until after your corpse is gone  be that  mins an hour a day...whatever.  The idea is no respawning and recovering gear and no revenge respawning and you have to face a real time wait to respawn again.  Makes death feel more permanent for your character as you cant just respawn grab gear and take out revenge on whoever killed you..  Make it harder to KILL another character and easier to disable them incapacitate them take them prisoner.  ie when your health reaches  you are incapacitated and your assailant can decide to rob you and leave revive you and take you prisoner or actually make the choice to finish you off.  Health  zero means you are NO longer a threat but you arent dead either.I think a lot of people dont want their opponents character dead they just want the threat to be eliminated and to rob their stuff.  No need to actually have the character be DEAD.  After say  minutes you wake up with very low levels of health blood etc and the game continues  OR your assailant has captured you and revived you and.....player interaction.,dayz,cmw5ujh,1,t5_2ty3s
2587058,0,t1_cmvp9bf,I would argue if you havnt played it in  months then dont go listing its problems sure you get the very rare annoying zombie but its very uncommon for them to teleport and hit you through walls and you learn to avoid situations where that could happen i say give it a try this server is pretty up to scratch and very fun.

2598569,0,t3_2pkd3x,A couple months ago my friends and I went back to playing DayZero and had a blast for a few weeks.  Id easily choose it over SA.  The problem was that with the return of a population on the BMRF servers came a return of hackers.  We ended up stopping going on there because we constantly had people teleporting behind us with the best guns.  A lot of the population began dropping off when that happened.If they had a better way to manage that then Id be there all the time.  DayZero is much superior to Standalone in my opinion.,dayz,cmxrq8k,0,t5_2ty3s

2695650,0,t1_cn9uzvq,You say that but whenever talks about realism and making this game more and more realistic pop up people talk about how its a game not a real life simulator and that games need to be fun. The EC video never said games shouldnt be fun just they shouldnt only be about fun. You have to relate this back to the original issue Some guy is complaining about rain and how it isnt fun. The harshness of the rain and its dangers are part of the simulation and pretty realistic. Sure its not fun to sprint through storms frantically searching for warmth but its definitely an experience. There are plenty of fun moments in Dayz but that doesnt mean everything in the game has to revolve around fun. Honestly I never thought about it but as a guy who would like to see hyper realistic sims Fun is holding gaming back IMO.Also what is and isnt fun is highly subjective so thats probably why he stuck to the dictionary term. I find the harsh survival stuff fun but its not a light hearted giddy fun. ,dayz,cnafv6x,1,t5_2ty3s

They complain now because they do a lot of damage and ruin your items. But people dont understand that the developers have increased their threat because people dont view them as a threat still. And theyre powerful now because its to compensate for the low number of zombies in general. People like to say they want harder and more zombies. I do.

2817067,0,t1_cno97nz,gtbut you refuse to play in them anywayNot true Ill go back to my point where I said people prefer joining filled servers the problem is there is only so much room. Ive tried countless times to stay in a nearly empty server and about  times do they actually start taking off. So I too am guilty of giving up and going to a nearly filled server as oppose to a PP server since thats my last resort and theres only so much I as a single person can do.  The most I can do and simply wish others would too is to menton PP to other players and tell them to try it out. Most people Ive recommended to really do prefer PP. The biggest issue with it is it makes people nauseous or its hard to look at. I really wish the devs get on that soon. I dont mind PP being the majority since it always has been but trying to join a PP server easily is an issue and I want both to coexist in harmony as they should of been from the beginning like most other games that offer both perspectives.,dayz,cnoakve,0,t5_2ty3s

2886906,0,t3_2t6lvz,Mechanics are only buggya problem because theyre currently placeholders and according to the dev team or dean hall while he was there anyways its pointless to change placeholders when if you change the system theyre on the placeholders will work betteryoud have to change that placeholder again if you did it before.But i mean they WOULDNT be buggya problem if theyd stop shoving placeholder features into a system that isnt complete. Try completing the system then adding features. Then you wont need placeholders. Sure wed have less to do for a while but id rather that than them add in something like we added this animation to this action but it locks you in place while doing it but its just a placeholder thats gonna get changed again when we finish the whole animationinventory system so dont worry about it. Why even put it in then? Finish your system then put in the animation already completed and without need to change it twice.

You should also play with a group as trading for what you need saves time and effort.I play on the UNZaP private shard which is usually  X and I can find some of what you mention in gt minutes. Last night for instance with most of us spawning in as freshies we had a Sporter with a  and  shot mag a  with  mags a CR with a mag AK with  mags AND an Amphibia no mag within the hour. We also picked up  MP mags at the police station and used the ammo in the CR. The rest was Blazes shotguns SKS and Mosins. But we had a clip for the Mosin and one box of SKS ammo too and we hadnt even shot anybody for this stuff! Ill add that only ONE guy came from a military base and hit a chopper on the way.In the last month one of our guys has carried a suppressed M which he liberated off some guy and Ive seen  MPs in the hands of clanmates grenades flashbangs and a whole slew of AKs of various shapes and sizes. The clans we usually play against like Ceremors merry band Halfbloods savages and FOGRIP are likewise armed to the fucking teeth.

There is a god mode hack in existence but its not incredibly common most cheaters are using some sort of ESP or script. When you come across a hacker your best bet is to try to kill them or to log off. Usually its to kill them unless youre with a group and its one of your buddies being targeted not you. Something youve got to remember it is most of the time hackers dont have incredible and theyre not very good in the game in general they rely on their hacks.

Thirdly the M is objectively the best automatic weapon in the game. Its useless at range without magpuls but you put both magpuls parts to decrease dispersion and then put that ACOG on and nobody can argue that its the king of middle ranges and given a bipod and sacrificing one magpul capable of easy sniping at Mosin ranges. The reason M rules over AKs is its miniscule recoil which is a huge advantage when tracking targets at range. ,dayz,co8pwqx,1,t5_2ty3s

Id also like to see better effects for weather and better particle effects for blood vomiting smoke bullets impacts water water pump for example.Possible negative effects are they overuse effects and make the game look too consoley and fake looking. I think the game looks pretty damn good and any changes should be quite subtle. The visuals just need a bit of polish not a complete overhaul except for dynamic lighting which is pretty broken.

There will never be matureserious mechanics for nudity in dayz. Its the same reason the devs decided not to add defecation to the game. Sure they could go for adding realism for having to relieve yourself but knew the end result would be military tents fills with shit firehouses shelves stored with shit and backpacks laying on the coast filled with shit.If you open the door for potential juvenile behavoir the gameplay will devolve to the lowest denominator. In the end adding penises and vaginas in dayz would take more away from a survival experience the devs are going for than it would add.YOU might use nudity for immersion and realism but tens of thousands of other players wont. ,dayz,codcowg,7,t5_2ty3s

No drink sick temperature in the negatives we tried to fight the elements... but in the end we both died... He could not take the struggle for hunger and he jumped off the hospital roof... I died from blood loss near the hospital... Before I died I gave all my gear to another random survivor... carry on friend... carry on...It was epic.

3108730,0,t3_2vr9ri,My experience of the Loot systemSay you have a room. It has  loot spawn points. It spawns a gun a box of ammo a tin of beans and a spanner.Someone comes in takes everything except a spanner. So you have  loot spots empty. The loot points have the potential to spawn many things. Eventually the points will respawn some loot. This time a book a tin of beans and a box of ammo. The cycle repeats itself until all four loot points have spawned something utterly useless.The above may not be entirely accurate but its my experience so far. Thats how you end up with  raincoats at the little boats on the coast. The netting gets taken and taken until all the points have spawned raincoats.,dayz,cok7vk6,24,t5_2ty3s

The official hive servers should be PP only. You shouldnt be able to lie down on top of a roof and see  all around you with zero risk.. you just shouldnt. Its ridiculous. not in this type of game.and Im sorry I want to see my character is not a good reason for keeping PP in this game. People will argue well its not an advantage because EVERYONE has the ability to use the magic floating camera!... Hmmm. Nope.Imagine youre inside the police station and you hear movement outside. You set up at the end of the hall and watch the door.. PP isnt helping you out at all in this case. Youre actually at a DISADVANTAGE versus the attacker when that should never be the case when youre defending an entry point..

People getting pissy because I pointed out that endgame gear should be harder to come by is why Im being downvoted. They want it to be uber easy to get those fully kitted AKs rather than having to work to get them.Furthermore people downvoting because theyre salty about my opinion isnt what downvoting is for. My comments are not irrelevant or offtopic Im being downvoted because peopled dislike my comment or disagree with it. Sad little derps.Like you said though from an immersion standpoint this picture is actually realistic.

Doesnt have to be crazy. My original build for my PC was about  and worked great for every game I played. Good fps and I could play very game on high quality. Honestly you can even build a good PC for cheaper if you intend to upgrade at some point. When it comes to PC I wouldnt just settle tho. New things come out all the time and parts get out dated very quickly. Although it doesnt seem like it. Building a pc is very easy.  years ago when I built mine with my Dad neither of us knew wtf we were doing. We watched some YouTube videos and got the thing running no problem. Not hard.

3244146,0,t1_coy9cey,simple that many players moving that fast in a small area causes desync. desync in a vehicle often kills the passengers. one way to limit complaints from vs cargo squad wipes would be to only allow  at a time in a vehicle until the server performance improves and lowers the chance of death by desync. I dont expect you to get it based on your recent posts but its a possibility. you dont show a lot of understanding about how alpha works and occasionally doesnt work so I doubt youll be able to process something as outlandish as the dev team making a strategic decision about development.,dayz,coy9hyg,1,t5_2ty3s

3256900,0,t1_cozikj6,One thing about the OPs idea I want to shift perspective on.This isnt just a new way to Trust the client but rather a new way to Not trust the client  In Arma cheaters could write scripts that could control every aspect of the game.  This is just the client doing some additional checks.  It cant do anything even when someone tries to abuse it.  At most the server would assume the cheater is suffering from desync and kick him from the game because of Network problemsThere is a saying Trust but Verify  There will always be a need to do a lot of things client side in order to minimize the feeling of latency.  Hitdetection and movement are currently clientside and can probably not be any other way.  The server already does some sanity checks for those.  But in Dayz  I want  square kilometer maps with a  players.  If the devs can make sure on a technology level more things can be moved to the client that cant be abused or used to hack we might actually see that happening sooner.,dayz,cozl7fu,1,t5_2ty3s

Were running down the road and this ghillie comes out of the police station and runs away from me he turned around and pointed. I fired my Sawn Off with very little contact and no bleed. My buddy follows him they proceed to empty mags into each other until both are dead. At this point I had been gunned down. Ran back tried to loot body and got gunned down again. I ran back again this time approaching more strategically I hid in a Bush the guy left the house we had all died in so I rushed in behind him before he could turn around to cover the door from the outside. I immediately went prone and looted the bodies. One of them had an M with  rounds left in the clip but no backpack because Ghillie. I decided this wasnt over so I waited in the hall for about ten minutes when he finally came back in I put  rounds in his legsdidnt wanna ruin anything and he died.

Be wary of drinking water bottles you get from other players they can be filled with disinfectant or alcohol tincture that will make you sick. Military bases airfields prison islands give everyone itchy trigger fingers.  Big risk for potentially bigger rewards. Electro is a killzone on most servers.  Police stations fire stations are also high riskhigh alert areas. When you quit a server try and do so in a building and close the door after yourself.

Navigating can be tricky but this should helpOn the main roads just of each town there will be a road sign telling you which town you are in it will be in RussianCyrillic alphabet.

Then click on web browser at the bottom and enter   This map is interactive zoomable and has both normal and Russian alphabet names of citiesplaces. There are other maps available but this is a great place to start until you learn what you like.Compasses work now in the game. Just put it in your hands go into first person view and look at the needle.If you are next to the ocean and its on your left you are heading south andor west.  If its on your right you are going north andor east. By looking at the map it should be easy to convince yourself of this.Using road signs an online map of Chernarus the oceancoastal road and a functional compass should help you find your way.For example you spawn in and have no idea where you are. Find the nearest road pick a direction and follow it to the nearest town. Find the town name on the sign outside town and then find that one on the map. Now you know roughly where you are. Pick where you want to go next and plot a route while looking at the map. Sticking to roads is easier I recommend it as you get familiar with the map.

How familiar are you with BIs games?Saying the standalone is inferior to the mod is one reason someone might say you dont understand game development. Why would an unfinished game be superior to a mod? Mods take a finished game and add to it mechanics that are far simpler to create as a mod than as enginelevel changes. Youd consider the mod to be pretty broken if you could have played it with all of the scripts half finished. You seem to have an expectation that the standalone development should have began at modquality and gotten better and better as time went on. That just isnt how it works. They tore out everything to be redone and this transitional process results in a much more broken and less cohesive experience in the meantime.,dayz,cp2d0of,1,t5_2ty3s

Still DayZ in its current form has no real competitor. In its genre theres many games but games that play and act just like DayZ just dont exist. Maybe you could call a game which has a completely different core competition.My point stands. Same goes for other games. There is no real competition for Assassins Creed for example. The genre Open World RPG has many games in it there just isnt any game just like Assassins Creed.Another example Battlefield amp Call of Duty. Those games are pretty much the same. Battlefield has bigger maps but after all its fast paced first person shooting. They are direct competition to each other. Just like Path of Exile and Diablo . Those games are pretty much similar. Even the HUD is the same. Of course you have different items and Path of Exile has a different skill system but the gameplay core game and the interactions with other players are exactly the same. Thats what i call competition. ,dayz,cp58sku,1,t5_2ty3s

3318536,0,t1_cp6ja5q,Really youre trying to use the developers dont always keep their promises argument? That applies to things like release dates and complex systems they want to add but end up not being able to. Reducing loot spawn rates is trivial. As trivial as changing an items description. If they say they are going to do it there is nothing stopping them. There is no factor of uncertainty here. You are relying way too heavily on what has been done so far to determine what will be done in the future. Do you seriously not see how flawed that logic is? If I had used that logic a week before the VS was added I would be saying vehicles would never be added. Or if I had made some prediction about spawn points right before they changed the spawn points.I say again if youre going to discount everything the developer say about what they are going to do I dont see why you are bothering to follow their updates at all in threads like these. You are making utterly useless observations. Looking at what has been done in the game so far does not give you the ability to predict what will be done in the future.,dayz,cp6ji37,1,t5_2ty3s

After that you can only use them for making a base camp. It is basicly not worth playing on or going for loot runs unless you are a book collector D What to do ? Use your brain. Playloot on non persistant servers and use persistant for a homebase. If you login to a persistant server after a weekly maintenance you can go look for loot but more than that you can actualy find trucks to use for the whole week. Simply use the persistance server with your base  for transportation purposes. Since most persistant servers only have like  players on them you can actualy use that to your advantage. Use the truck to go somewhere park it in a secure location change server lootkill. When yoiu want to go home relog to the persistant server pickup your truck go homebase.The lack of imagination people have is distrurbing to say the least..I have my base setup every wenesday it has at least  trucks i and my friends can use for going places ALL WEEK LONG. So yes persistance is broken but is more than usable in its current state.Use the  bil year worth of evolution you have betwean your ears to actualy do something not downvote posts on reddit and be a whiny little bitch.,dayz,cp92svf,10,t5_2ty3s

3463407,0,t1_cpmwabk,One reason to do this is the quick moving water of a spring fed stream near the center is usually much cleaner than the almost stagnant water near the edge. The mud where the water meets the grass is full of decaying organic matter which is much more toxic. So its very important when drinking NOT to disturb the mud and this is one way to do that.Note even a semi modern water system has water too clean to condition your gut enough to handle stream water so this is a last resort survival technique which fits in pretty well with the survival horror theme of DayZ if you ask me.TLDR this is a survival move for cleaner river water.,dayz,cpn1xd7,4,t5_2ty3s

If possible Id like the devs to code in something where if  or more zombies are within a vicinity of eachother or chasing the same PCNPC they get an arbitrary speed boost where they will always outrun the player or animal eventually.. so youre forced to run into a house and quickly barricade it and try and survive by picking them off one by one. No zig zagging into the woods or running in circles until they pathfind off of you.EDIT  hell dont even have to code anything. just make all zeds faster than players by default.

3557676,0,t1_cpxnqwy,I have no problem with the concept of bear traps. They make sense. in fact Id like to see a craftable trap maybe a snare made from ropewire? that fulfills the same role. The reason for this is such traps wont kill you theyll just maim you. Landmines though...they dont sit right with me. I dont like the idea of a one shot kill item in Day Z. Survival should be hardcore sure but landmines just feel cheap. Comparable to say being one shot by a sniper at least the sniper has to aim and calculate range and theres a chance wind or gravity might spare their intended victim. Likewise sniping has a risk to the sniper who stands a chance of aggroing zombies or attracting the attention of other players. Then you have a landmine which anyone can place near a truck and kill the next player who happens to decide to go for a ride.,dayz,cpxsset,1,t5_2ty3s
3557971,0,t1_cpxniun,Most of the things he said about zombies I didnt experience at all. I could trap every zombie I encountered in a building by closing the doors unless the zombie was too close to me and made it out before I could close it. They never hit me when they were out of range I could run away and the zombie wouldnt hit me as well just chase me. There were also a ton of zombies on the servers I was on.

3566614,0,t3_316g2q,Right now Loot respawns on server restart but not all of it. Only those that were taken. Persistence just means that when you drop something it stays there for specific time limit. It might be easier for me to explain what the new persistence and central economy is supposed to be Currently its a bit of a WIPPersistence and Loot Economy All items placed on the ground will remain there even after the server restarts Tents and Vehicles are permanent unless they are destroyed Items have a life time that decays until they are cleaned up and respawn my assumption is that after a length of time ANY item on the ground decays from PristinegtWorngtDamagedgtBadly DamagedgtRuinedRemoved Items that have fully decayed are removed by the server clean up Item Respawn and Clean up happen in real time the server wont have to restart for the loot to cycle High traffic areas will spawn less low traffic areas will spawn more idea is to have people travel the map thus changing the hotspots Will eventually allow for basescamps that will be specific to that server Servers should have to restart much less Goal if I remember correctly was once every  or  hours Longer uptime means less interruptions of gameplay All loot is controlled by a central economy which limits the number of items Basically it controls how many Ms AKs can openers beans books can spawn shared between all the public servers ,dayz,cpytjvj,2,t5_2ty3s

There should perhaps be a slight chance you can find any item anywhere... but yeah there is the risk of it becoming pink dresses in army barracks! XD Edit Using the M as an example I think that particular item should spawn  in areas where you would expect to find them and  elsewhere. So  or  in every  will spawn outside military areas.

It is obvious these people who dont find enjoyment in the struggle to survive really shouldnt be playing DayZ in the long run. I may get downvoted but their opinion is a bad influence on DayZ. if everything went their way. DayZ would just be HZ Battle Royal. Or even worse itll just be ArmA  Wasteland. Why turn DayZ SA into a game that isnt true to its roots... This is why I worry about modding. Great things will come to the game sure. But it is probably guaranteed that DayZ SA will be modded into overpochepoch. I have never played those mods but from what Ive heard its weapons helicopters and landrovers galore there...  And now that the game is really emphasizing on surviving the environment they are throwing tantrums all over the place. They refuse to adapt... We all had to adapt over the course of DayZs development up to now. And we will in the future but they need to remember this that DayZ isnt a battle royale PVP deathmatch...

I dont dislike the direction theyre going... but dont think they shouldve done so with such a sloppy update all at once. They broke a lot of gameplay mechanics that wouldve been helpful in this update. They also didnt balance hunger and food quality rates to make it semiplayable before updating. I think the biggest thing is most people dont want to pick apples with some shitty animation playing when they can fucking SEE an apple right there on the tree. Thats not fun thats tedious. I dont care that PvP is not the center of the game. I do care that  of the community is turning to cannibalism because that is the only viable way to play. Thats fucked up and no different than the other end of the pendulum they were on previously.,dayz,cq1yeiy,1,t5_2ty3s

That is all remember. I kept an eye out for it though as its always discussed.Trying to find the source for a question only ever answered in the odd video or reddit thread is difficult. I just spent  minutes on it to return nothing.I am however  sure that this is the case. The devs specifically said a few years. They were intentionally vague and they went on to say that was the point that you should create your own storyline with your character.They dont lay out that the rest of the world is infected though so you could just show up on the beach and be completely fresh to the apocalyptic world...Or you could have woken up after an attempt at escaping Chernarus via raft? Who knows all that is up to you.

3611701,0,t3_31qb00,The MP disappearing bug has not been fixed as usmowk suggested. Its not actually an MP bug but any large items in your backpack.  Its to do with how your backpack is stored on the server and repopulated once you log off and log back in.  You might have noticed that your items are often in a different position when you log back into the game.What happens is that items are stored in a database with tags associated with them relating to their position in your pack.  Sometimes if you have large items at the bottom of your pack the way it assigns number and repopulates your backpack can mean there is no space left to repopulate your MP.The solution is to always have your larger items like MPsAKUProtector CasesMed Kits at the very top  of your backpack.  This way they will be populated into your backpack first and not last and there will always be space for them.Wobo did a very good video explaining how it works www.youtube.comwatch?vfKIuqfjZc,dayz,cq3yko0,2,t5_2ty3s

Try your best to head north because on public servers loot respawns in real time. So most people spawn on the coast then loot it all and move on. If you look on the coast youll find nothing because the real time spawning is leaving behind more loot in places less people have been. Big cities can have loot because people might be too afraid of all the zombies in a city. But if you hit a city I would make sure you have guns.

3625011,0,t3_31hrlq,Have a range of incapacitated states other than unconcious and dead.It would be fantastic to get shot and be incapacitated as your screen goes blurry and starts to fade out hearing the gun shots soften and fade into nothingness as you slowly pass on.  Having the remote possibility of saving players in this state would make encounters more exciting knowing that you may still have a chance to revive your friend.  If you could apply basic first aid to stop the bleeding then they could remain in an unconcious state for a long time whilst you search for then apply additional aid saline bags blood transfusions etc. Carrying unconcious players I think this was on the road map. You could put them in vehicles and drive them back to your base where you know you have the necessary medical supplies.

The values are really off in terms of how much food you need to eat to get out of starvation state and how long you stay out of starvation once you are there.

For three days after . anybody posting about the BROKEN loot system on private hives was flamed by people like you saying that they should move inland and stop being whiny bitches because its supposed to be hard. Eventually enough people raised te issue  getting flamed to hell in the process  and the devs acknowledged the problem and are now working on it.Just because YOU are fine doesnt mean that everyones game is working right and it doesnt mean that it must be down to them doing something wrong. ,dayz,cqcxljw,3,t5_2ty3s

3696542,0,t1_cqdlddw,Yes I forgot to mention the improvised knife.  Skinning animals is an issue in . prerollback unless you have a weapon to bring them down.The test was great and I like the idea.  Some of the talk around having zonerelated spawns like  geographic locations where loot will respawn within that zone rather than all the way on the other side of the map.  Although in that case you may run into dupers just picking up anything and everything in a certain zone to get continuous drops...but its a great step in the right direction...and if the zones were big enough it would make this difficult.Allinall I dont think rolling back is a bad idea until they can do some more tweaking based on the results they received from the initial . inland loot scoot.,dayz,cqdmpfk,1,t5_2ty3s

I do hower totally understand it is going to be hard and people will probably shoot at me if I am quiet. But you can still interact without talking. I have been friendly without talking just using ingame gestures and such. But the times I play unable to talk I avoid people. I understand it is going to be a different game the times I dont use the mic. But saying dont play the game is a bit bold. Id rather say understand it is going to be harder and you are going to get shot at more.When I do play with a mic and people dont talk back I am the same. I assume not always depends on situation they are on teamspeak and such. Hard to take chances in this game. Or it will be when loot gets even more sparse.

And I have what is considered a very good deal when compared with other arrangements.This outrage yet again builds unrealistic expectation in people about how much developers actually get for making games.So sure it can totally be outrageous. But I take great issue with the reasons people are justifying their outrage with. I suspect most of it is because Modding has long been about doing stuff for free Fraudulent mods will take money deserved by legitimate creators People dont like the publishers and so dont want the most to go to them many more reasons ....But those are different and should not be confused with what is a reasonable revenue split.

Even with experienced people showing me the ropes...it just didnt have the same appeal to me as DayZ and the map is vastly smaller.The night and server that I was on was being overrun by Chinese hackers.  They had taken control of the police station and were shooting people through walls and it turned into a kill the Chinese experience...which undoubtedly was fun but I just couldnt get immersed in the game they same way I do with DayZ...the realism was lacking for me.The bowplay in HZ is spot on though...it was a blast to use the bow even if there was a reloading glitch that made me drop it multiple times.The biggest deterrent for me in HZ though was the paytowin airdrop mechanic.

Do you ban players for duping? Will you ban us? Me The DayZ devs have clearly stated in recent posts that Duping is a form of cheating and exploiting.

Our Admin Team has a particular set of skills skills that have been acquired over years of running successful servers skills that make us a nightmare for cheaters hackers amp dupers.

In the one storey cabin theres a spawn under the bedside tables. Vegetables and fruit are currently invisible but they are there if you hit tab when youre near them they show up as an empty box  if you shift it into your hands it appears. Theyre usually on shelving the one by the stairs in the piano house usually has something.

Again though this is nothing new just something youre privy to with the Early Access model. These road maps while serving as goals also gives investors an idea of where they are and how theyre measuring up. Ill allow that in a tradition Triple A release the developers would have more of a fire lit under their asses to meet goals sometimes with disastrous results Battlefield  anybody?. Im sure that Early Access developers do have a generous amount of wiggle room since theyre not answering to the suits but they are still catering to investors with that. That is the business side of things and are somewhat out of the individual developers and sometimes even the lead developers control.But again I find myself repeating the same song in my head At the end of the day the developers reserve all right to make the game as they see fit and the customers are nothing more that bugstress testers. Warnings are in place so that you know damn well that this is not the finished product and you are largely a beta tester. By spending that  dollars you are consenting to that fact. Bitching and moaning to the developers especially in the nonconstructive manner that you see in OPs picture and does nothing more than piss developers off.If you want your game finished quit flapping your gums and let them do their jobs. I know that sounds harsh but its said with the same level of respect that the community reaches out to the developers with.,dayz,crl2byn,0,t5_2ty3s

4135367,0,t1_crrlrgy,Funnily enough your edit is a good point to refute from. I have made that mistake through crossed wires that he changed engine but whether he changed engine or not isnt the main factor.Gary fundamentally rethought how nearly every core system would work in the game. He decided to can a year of development not because he changed engine but because he changed how to do things. He admitted he stuffed up his design from the start. If you know Gary he is quite selfdeprecating and was honest about this. I love the guy and his games and rust is better for his decision. He didnt change engine but he still changed ideas which meant he pretty much started the whole game over. So it is a fair comparison to make. As these are the types of decisions made in game development. I have doubts about UE being able to support dayZ fully mapplayer sizes amount of items etc. It has grown a lot over the last couple of years so anyone with more knowledge can please correct me. The  doesnt sound like a fair point seeing they bought a small game studio after releasing the game to help with development.

Its really putting me off Dayz as it seems not much progress has been made over  years.  Sure there are a lot of shiny new loot but if the fundamental mechanics of the game are broken then shiny loot wont compensate for that fact.Another thing concerning me is that the new patches are making the fundamental problems even worse.

4229825,0,t1_cs1f7dc,The Guide to Wilderness SurvivalThe goal of this survival guide is to teach travelers of Chernarus how to survive off the land rather than allowing themselves to become dependent on finding loot in urban areas. As the game progresses in its development this skill will become more and more necessary. Whether or not surviving on scavenged items is possible being independent of that need is an advantage over your competition and ensures that your success will be far less reliant on having good luck. Please read this guide with the understanding that although it is possible to survive entirely in the wilderness there are still some positives to incorporating urban scavenging into your routine. Some useful items simply cannot be found in the wilderness i.e. metal wire and may be useful to you when camping in a remote location. Because crafting is such an integral part to making the most of your survival you will eventually need some items which are not possible to find in nature. Whether youre looking to become a hermit or simply want establish a solid backup plan for yourself this guide should contain information that is useful to you. There are many positives to utilizing the wilderness . Less waste. No spilled food from cans and plants amp animals have multiple useful byproducts. Even better most of what you gather or produce will be in pristine condition. . Less risk. If you dont need to leave the wilderness to gather supplies you can more easily avoid running into other people  who may be hostile. Just as important youre more easily able to create a supply cache that makes getting back up and running after a tragic incident that much easier. . Ready availability. Everything you could ever want from the wilderness is generally available close by and in sufficient quantities. Need food? Find an apple tree or a Canina bush. Broken leg? Grab some twigs and tear up that shirt youre wearing to make a splint.  a. Everything is close by because the wilderness is all around you.  b. Supplies are unlimited. You will never be able to pick every apple chop down every tree kill every animal or drink all the water.  c. Variety is tremendous. As of . you have three fruits four vegetables ten kinds of meat five different animal byproducts and five raw wood materials at your disposal. The number of items that can be crafted or converted from these materials is extensive..... just a quick example.,dayz,cs2drl5,1,t5_2ty3s

You have to learn to make it a good encounter you have to know what youre dealing with just by looking at the guy. The way they talk and move gives out a lot about them. Is he moving a lot not stopping making small steps left and right he is probably afraid of you or maybe he thinks its a set up maybe you have friends lurking waiting for a good shot.    I have h and in the first  I was a complete noob when it comes to interaction. I have been handcuffed a lot not at popular places like elektro or cherno or some other popular place just somewhere in gorka just like that. Never got killed after that. Had a lot of shootout at random places and some even ended in an agreement to not kill each other and we shared some stuff. I have been betrayed a dozen of times and I have made friends too. With some I even play today.    The thing is that you have to go with the flow of the game. Dont try to force it because it wont go the way you think it will. If things can go wrong they will.

4451149,0,t1_csqz1ws,Honestly... locking isnt an issue. Its the unlocking part that requires the tool.Id suggest pristine lock picks work like normal. The locks themselves should vary in difficulty. Like a house would have an easy lock as oppose to the jail which would have a hard. The condition of the lock pick should come into question while using the pick frequently. It would eventually break not necessarily at Badly Damaged. Damaged picks against a prison door could easily break while doing fine on a house lock and possibly jam the lock itself. However... Ive always liked the Tom Clancy Rainbow Six way of entering doors. I think a nice solid kick should open most locked doors or possibly a close range shotgun blast to the handlelockframe.

That would be realistic but their animators and coders suck too bad to make this happen and you fanboys are too blind to see it. Just because they want to fix something to make it more real does not mean their attempt is the best solution but as experience with dayz has shown usually the worst. There is no points for trying hard and failing when you sell a commercial product.

It is a lot easier to headlook around and keep tabs on your buddies in third person. I like to see my character. Better situational awareness. Maybe this is too much like my first point but man the FOV in third person is just so much biggerbetter. You can see such a wide swath of the landscape Looting. Some spots like on top of the lockers in barracks seem impossible to loot in first person. Granted there are also spots where I have to switch to first person to loot like under the beds but on a third person server I have the luxury of being able to do that. Habit. Im used to third person and so are all my buddies. It would require a concerted effort to switch everyone over. If it aint broke... Ive been playing DayZ since the mod and I have hours and hours of fun playing in third person. I dont really feel a... need ? to switch things up. Ive got a good thing going why mess with it?in b u just like to peek  I wont deny that I use third person to look over wallsaround corners.

Its actually been much improved on now since they changed the zombie spawn distance from m to m.  Doesnt sound like much but anytime theres obstructions like trees or a hill it makes it much more difficult when you enter a town to tell whether or not the zombies are yours or another players.  With the increased spawn distance the zombies are much more spread out when you enter the town so you cant tell your own zombies by them being clustered up at their spawn point like before.,dayz,ctbju2f,4,t5_2ty3s

Still a huge number of people on here who get excited for each update no matter how small myself included!

The truth is this game is buggy as hell and they will probably never get it to a state where it is worthy to call it a final release. The performance is garbage the surviving is a joke and if you make it until you get an fire axe you are practically immortal. So what is the long term motivation? Right there is currently none...

4676844,0,t1_ctjyn4g,Sounds like . is a build worthy for you to install. Other then the player controller almost all you wishes are somewhat coming true.CLE working in .. Loot actually makes sense a lot more then it used to do and guns arent everywhere. Inland is the way to go. It still needs finetuning but it is leaps and bounds ahead of what we got.Persistence working in ..Repairable Vehicles present in .. No more jump in and drive off. We need glow plugs and car batteries now.Serverside performance really nice in .. Been experiencing instant actions for the past week. Hotbar worked as well.And finally desync. They seem to have made substantial progress in this area. I hardly noticed any desync in.. There was some but it was a lot better then stable.What do you say? Maybe give . a try?Add server restarts are once every  hours in exp. This guarantees a full day amp night cycle.

4772233,0,t1_ctvxui0,im excited to hear that. my biggest grievance was that until recently a lot of the core elements werent really seeing much progress. THATs the issue for me. When you compare the development arc of this game to like KSP or ARMA its glaringly obvious that certain core elements were ignored VERY early in the development and its effected how the game plays the whole way through. It feels like a lot has been done to apply bandaid fixes to issues in the past when they really probably should have been reworked from the ground up rather than crowbar a temporary fix. KSP while not a multiplayer and therefore a bit easier to develop smoothly has been a shining example of proper priorities in dev arc. They throw entire aerodynamics physics models out and release entirely new groundup models every few months in the last year. Admittedly its a physicsdriven game so thats the most important thing but the idea is fundamental you simply cant play the game and make use of new features of the core is weak. Im sure they are working very hard to get DayZ to a state that they imagined when they first started out. I just feel a little concerned about how far along its come and how little about the way the game handles has actually changed. I will say that the way loot spawns is marginally improved from when I played the weekend of Early Access release... Really the only discernible difference is that now stuff spawns inaround wrecked cars honestly. ,dayz,ctw2zd6,1,t5_2ty3s

4815451,0,t1_cu1ij56,Wall clipping I am assuming you mean people clipping into walls to kill unsuspecting people who enter a building? This is caused by the legacy player controller which is due to be replaced. Picking up items being bugged in some buildings is due to the random doors being open or closed on restart. The server sees a closed door and the client sees an open one. You walk through what you see as an open door but the server sees it as closed so on the server you are outside at that closed door and unable to pick items up. They could remove the random doors mechanic and this would be fixed I believe. Bugs should be expected until final release. The things you mentioned arent super serious bugs but they can be annoying. Some of these bugs are because the system causing the issue is due to be replaced which would waste time fixing something you are just going to throw away.,dayz,cu1izc5,4,t5_2ty3s

Brian covers this in the devblogs which im certain you dont follow.Launch the game see that no stats connected? thats stats. Not visible yet but again confirmed in the status reports they are tracking stats.Ongoing. Bohemia is hiring go fix it for themAesthetically yes.

Youre only ever really there to get higher end gear and I only ever run into other shooters.  In real life situations the first place warlords take over are military installations so itd be no surprise to find the more violent elements where the weapons will be.

There is no SPM at the moment so what are new players supposed to do for now?As for safe looting if you dont go to military areas it really doesnt make much difference  high pop or low pop youre just as likely to meet someone as not. Bottom line is playing on low pop is not an abuse of the game mechanics so makes no difference to me whether people do it or not.,dayz,cunksqj,1,t5_2ty3s

4994724,0,t1_cuo1ijb,gt Running is only an option if the spot is made at  meters away with lots of available concealment and routes to rabbit on. Any closer or too open and you just get shot in the back.I think you are giving to much credit to the server hopper here hitting another player that is running away is hard even at  meters at even longer distances its very hard and if the guy you are trying to shoot is running evasively its almost impossible. And if you spot the guy first he is no threat to you you can just turn around and go the other way. You are just trying to justify your kills and if I didnt know any better I would say that you are the person you fear so much you have become the person who when he simply spots another player feels cornered and have to kill them.,dayz,cuo1tkg,2,t5_2ty3s

5006465,0,t1_cupdnjw,From what i understand the idea is to have all the parts taking account of the condition of each determine the overall condition of the gun.  However I dont know if each will have a different weight.  for example the base condition of the gun is good but all the other parts hand guard stock optic are all damaged.  In this case maybe the gun will be damaged as an overall value.  The overall value of the gun will affect the weaponss performance accuracy.I dont know how much is actually working in the game currently.  And of course i could be completely wrong too.....I  try to stay up on the developement so this is how i understand the mechanics will be at release.,dayz,cupgucv,1,t5_2ty3s

You could set it to a hotkey and it will take sips without any animations or stopping what you are doing.I also dont think it should take up any more than  slots.

Besides they arent even allowed to look at the logs unless theyre looking for hackers. But hey another unenforced thing. Also Bohemia doesnt handle bans surprise surprise. They offloaded the work onto BattlEye and BattlEye doesnt care unless you hack exploits are not their problems. My take on this all is patch your holes instead of throwing a fit that people abuse glitches majority of dupe methods get discovered by accident anyways. Look at Valve for example. Every so often youll get some game breaking bug in their games TF being my favorite here infinite sentry glitches sky walking getting into walls building in walls.

5203100,1,t1_cvcq4hw,Thankyou for the reply and for your input but i wasnt talking about how fake the video is and how scripted the video is.. i personally dont give two shits about how fake his videos are. He undeniably makes quality cinematography out of a game. He doesnt claim that it is real anyway? All i really wanted to say and i should have been more specific in the original post perhaps is that i would really like to see the mechanic of having to physically attach items to your car tent or base etc instead of just having big rectangular inventories. Perhaps the devs have never even thought about this mechanic coming into the game and i thought perhaps it could spark some creativity in the community. Im most certain that no devs will see this though as unfortunately it has turned into a shitpost about how fake a scripted mod is.

5211122,0,t1_cve420a,It just doesnt work like that. Technically they could make the game have multicore support SLI super dynamic terrain destruction with buildings breaking apart blah blah blah... IF they had the time and money. You do realize that  months of engine rework is nothing. It takes literally years to develop a good engine and keep it up to date. Every game engine that has high expectations is being developed over the course of several years.    As Ive tried explaining earlier the basic idea is that they didnt expect this game to get so popular so fast. With all the support they got from it theyve decided to expand and rewrite their plans. ArmA s engine wasnt good enough so they had to think of something else so BI hired a lot of new people for DayZ specifically and decided to develop a engine purely designed for DayZ and future projects.     Essentially Enfusion and ArmA s engine will be developed in parallel forming two branches and occasionally borrowing tech from one another. or at least this is how I understand it    Anyway the point is that this is a lot more complicated than it seems a lot of things didnt go as planned and this is why it is how it is now. They arent doing anything wrong.,dayz,cve4shz,1,t5_2ty3s

5251941,0,t1_cvixqa8,You have to clearly define whether youre talking about the state of both games now or the current state of the mod vs a more refined and finished version of SA.  Right now at this moment vanilla mod offers quite a bit more even though the mechanics are more primitive than what is being worked on for SA.  I think now is a great time to play the mod for people that are no longer interested in testing and reporting bugs for SA.As for how this relates to player interactions I go off my personal experience which has shown me that there are a higher number of interesting and meaningful player interactions in vanilla mod.  SA does have those interactions but the number of them pale in comparison to straight up PvP and childish trolling.  Theres nothing to lose for killing and nothing to gain from helping people in SA aside from the RP element.  If theres nothing to gain from play styles that are alternative to PvP then people are just going to shoot each other because its the only real thing to do in the game right now that involves interaction with other players.,dayz,cvj1q5d,3,t5_2ty3s

5262021,0,t3_3n2nhe,In general a system that slightly buffs or debuffs depending on one thing or the other is a good idea I think.

Or have psychological factors of some kind maybe total isolation over a long period of time can lead to  unwanted effects.

Anyway almost every time I was able to find some food apple trees rock a small gun police cars police station bodies and looting wasnt bad for a town where gunfire was ringing all around.    If you go inland towards Stary you get an idea of what the CLE is going for. I think the loot system now is better than ever before however thats irrelevant. The fact is that they can now with this new system tweak any and all variables to do with loot on the fly which means less updating and the loot might be decreasedincreased week to week.

Them being in the world that this game takes place in is totally plausible and even more so the fact that a civlian could easily learn how to operate one.

5457383,0,t1_cw97on4,As stated likely tonnes of data.Its pretty simple they gather data all the time anyways and there has been a much lighter but more constant presence on the hardcorePP servers.Besides the whole PP vs PP argument is moot. The team will get around to it when they get around to it and they have various things already planned ahead which theyve mentioned.And e.g. if Brian Hicks wants to put all of the official servers into PP which does NOT mean all public servers then by all means they should just do it then.Doesnt matter either way the PP argument is really an opinion only anyways so its just down to preference.EDITThey can fix all of the issues with PP already simply by applying logic but all of that is on hold clearly at the moment due to the wait on the new renderer AND the newer control which are more responsive.,dayz,cw98dms,5,t5_2ty3s

DayZ shouldnt have classes or any sort of visual cue as to their play style.People seem overly concerned about KoS and bambislaying but seem to always discount the fact that the zombies once properly implemented would be a serious danger to any player. Hordes have been mentioned. Even without them zombies will probably number in the thousands and will respawn. Firing guns at all and sundry will in all probability become far less of an option. Thats not to say that people wont still axe the shit out of a bambi instead but I think some of the behaviour some consider a bit dickish will naturally die down. This would probably be a good thing as it increases the tension of the situation as well as the dynamic do I shoot? What if they shoot? Can I use the zombies to my advantage?

If hes situated in Stockholm or Gothenburg you need way more than  euros a month for basic living.According to his own post he spent k euros on  years of rent yielding  euros montly in rent alone. If hes in a room rental apartment in Stockholm capital of Sweden or if hes renting a room in second or third hand in Stockholm not uncommon for students since there are almost no apartments left then yeah thats easily what you pay in rent alone.

5574000,0,t1_cwny4ij,I disagree on both accounts  I think we can agree to disagree though.The reason being that I cant see how you judge the higher rate of fire against the round and its damage.

I rarely engage others below  m.And pp players that care simply have to nag pp especially if content comes from a multiplier aka content creator  I know you have reasons to choose pp but just look at the behaviour hugging the sand bunkers and shit.

5579086,0,t1_cwol53f,uTjonteh have a good list of similar development scales.  Id like to add one thing.The issues you listed are core issues bugs.  In traditional software development terms which seems to be what BI is using bugs unless critical and breaking are fixed in BETA.  During ALPHA development the main focus goes on making the product feature complete.  Thats why those core bugs arent being fixed yet...they arent breaking the game they arent halting development theyre just there.And if youre wondering why devs dont fix bugs as they go its because when new features are added new bugs will crop up and break old fixes for bugs making them redo work.  Instead if they push out mostall the features and then knock out the bugs its a smooth development cycle.,dayz,cwomyk6,2,t5_2ty3s

I dont know how often similar threads crop up but if its as bad as you say then thats just another bad sign. Not all of us are here daily. You would think that as a game develops and nears completion the patches would improve. At least that is the trend among successful early access games. You are being more than optimistic about returning players and you figures are based on nothing more than your own wishes. There is literally nothing to support the idea that k people will suddenly decide to play the game again. Even when better patches such a . are released DayZ continues to lose players. The dev team arent going to be pulling any miracles and improvements are incremental there isnt going to be a definitive REALLY good patch. Thats a pipedream if Ive ever heard one.

It is also the first time I had ever played the DayZ mod.Its night and I am in Cherno. I have no fucking clue whats going on. All I know is its dark and braindogs want to eat me alive.I walk around the small city desperately searching for beans and any weapon I can get my hands on. My Makarov is out of ammo I am starving and can barely see. I consider a quick trip to the ground floor from the top of the school.Shots in the distance. An unfortunate souls ticket has been punched. I am sure my fate is no different my death not far away.I walk toward the school preparing to end it all.Out of the corner of my eye there looms a shape unlike any I am used to. Curiosity gets the better of me.As I creep forward the shape becomes recognizable. A bus!As quickly as I can while keeping to the grass and shadows I move toward it. Certainly I have not been the only one to notice it. I can practically feel eyes watching me as I move forward.I get in the drivers seat to check its condition. A broken wheel the body is damaged and there is very little gas. As long as I can get my hands on a wheel I should be able to make it to a gas station and away from this place. Away from those who would take my newfound prize from me.As I exit the bus I hear talking not too far away. People! I quickly hide in a nearby bush hugging myself to the ground in hopes they do not see me.As they approach their voices become clearer. They are talking about the vehicle. About how to fix it. A wheel! Theyve found a wheel! I must take it from them but how...?They walk over to the bus. One begins replacing the damaged wheel while the other keeps watch. There is no way I can win this fight. Even if I got one replacing the wheel the other has a weapon and could kill me with relative ease.My mind is racing as the wheel is fixed and they begin to load up in the bus. There is only one thing left to do.I stand up from my hiding place walk next to the bus and cue my mic. I was prepared to die before. Its either now or in a couple of minutes when I throw myself from a rooftop.Hesitantly I hail them. I say I am a friendly person and would like a ride if they would have me. Without pause they say that yes there is room and to hop on!The welcome is like music to my ears! Friendly players! After being told that you can expect nothing more than to be murdered on sight by other players I can hardly believe it. Strangers are welcoming me implicitly trusting me and that I will do the right thing. The feeling is strange but not unwelcome.I hope on the bus and they introduce themselves. I tell them my name and how thankful I am that they have offered me the ride. They ask where I am going. I tell them I had no plan and that whatever they have in mind is alright with me. We pull away from the buss resting place and head to a gas station to fill up.As we sit waiting for the tank to fill we plan a route to the northwest airfield along which we can collect loot. It is decided that our first stop is to be the Balota military compound just south of the airfield. It is close and not heavily trafficked they say so it will be a perfect spot to start. Not knowing anything about the most traveled areas I agree and tell them they probably know better. I will follow them wherever they go.On the way to the airfield we come across a man running along the side of the road. We honk and pull up beside him asking if he would like a ride. He thanks us accepts and enters the bus. Introdictions are made all around and we continue on our way.We pull into the treeline across the road and just north of the camp and exit the vehicle. Not speaking a word we cross the road each entering the camp from a different gap in the barriers. We begin searching the camp and calling out any loot we might think the others need. The search proves uneventful yet bountiful. I have found for myself ammunition for my pistol and a bit of food. The others have done similarly well.As we begin to leave the camp I hear the sound of a soda can being opened. I stop dead in my tracks and call for the others to do the same. I tell them I think somebody is here.Emboldened by our strength in numbers we decide to find the person hiding close by. We will invite them to join us. Unspoken but on each of our minds is the desire to kill them and take whatever they are carrying if they do not accept.My companions fan out into the compound itself while I begin tracking along the eastern wall of the compound. I check the northern watchtower but find nothing. As I climb down I think I see movement in a small alcove crated by a gate. I creep forward along the wall to get a better view.Its a person lying prone! I call out to them asking if they are friendly if they want a ride on the party bus. There are a few moments of silence before they answer in an affirmative. They stand up and I call out to my companions that I have found somebody and they want to join us.Not wanting to stick around for much longer we all head over to the bus and leave quickly. Introductions are made again and we continue on our way.At this point it has gotten later than any of us realize and it is time for each of us to take a break. We have come to enjoy each others company and the decision is made to take the bus up into the woods to the west of the northwest airfield and park it. The beginnings of a camp.The trip north is uneventful and we spend the time chatting thinking to the future and the possibilities that lay ahead for our budding group.We park the bus and say our goodbyes. Each of us logs off to return to our lives each planning to return soon.At our groups height there are about twenty of us each having come into the group in their own way. Some were people we knew before and invited to play others were found in our wanderings and were offered the chance to join. Each of us brought something unique to the table.That person we found at the Balota airfield. The man lying prone trying to hide from us. The one we were contemplating killing I have now known for three years. We no longer play DayZ very much having moved on from game to game but he has become a regular and irreplaceable fixture in our Teamspeak server.Im glad nobody had to die that night.I also still have the Fraps footage around somewhere. I always wanted to make a YouTube series out of it but never got around to actually doing it. Maybe Ill finally get around to it.Sorry for the wall of text.

Im pretty sure theyre aware of it and have no intention of changing it.Im guessing the new player controller will just empower them to smooth out the edges so that the overall feel is more natural.  For instance I would expect the sharp change from jogging to slow walk depending on hill incline to be smoothed out and not be so jarring and immersion breaking.,dayz,cyjkolx,2,t5_2ty3s

Assuming you can comprehend this the actions the admins took to protect their characters breaks the agreement they made when they purchased the server. . These actions that the admins took not only break the contact they agreed too but break the game. You need to drop the whole entitlement thing. If your buying a server just to loot up and dont want anyone killing you then your wasting your money and wasting your time. ,dayz,cymei69,14,t5_2ty3s

As a frequent player on the UN servers Im not that impressed with the kills. You rarely roll alone and often the group is . If I were going to watch more of your videos I would prefer if it were a more storyoriented series where we see some solo gameplay. But thats just me. Im picky about my kill montage videos.,dayz,cymrcow,0,t5_2ty3s

As I walked around for about an hour I saw no one else the entire time in game...and I felt like I was just lost.I come from playing MMOs and primarily intricate fps like B from time to time but am sad to say I spent the last year from November October  on Destiny in XB...finally moved back to PC and being a zombieapocalypse fan seeing all these early access games exploring the genre of survival looked to fun to pass up. Its been slow here today at work and with you guys replying back Ive been checking out all the cool resources like DayZtv etc and just trying to learn up. Thanks for the feedback!,dayz,cyx0gyr,1,t5_2ty3s

It allows you and your group to add locations to the map that are updated realtime when players click on the map to update their locations that is.

6242331,0,t3_41320j,because the devs make things called deadlines and then miss them by a year renderer was supposed to be delivered January ..trust me im a fan. but the devs are horrible at keeping things on schedule. Hell its been a month and a half now since the last status report and those are supposed to be every  weeks was supposed to be every week but they ran out of weekly content to share..at this point the game is supposed to be DONE by fall of this year and I gotta say i really dont see how thats possible. I like dayz and its potential so Ill continue to follow the games snail pace of development but at this point the dayz hype is basically setsail when the games finally completed i wouldnt be surprised if its playerbase has shunk even further. ,dayz,cyz6o61,29,t5_2ty3s

6244043,0,t1_cyzcifv,I feel as if scrum has caused them to deviate entirely from their original scope and at this point its turned into chaos with deadlines they cannot accurately meet. At that point being agile actually becomes a hindrance. Had they started this project with set goals that they were forced to do they could have laid the foundation for the rest of the content instead of increasing their scope without making substantial progress.

They might care about the user experience more or they might care more about the money it all depends.However I refuse to believe that a project of this scope has any room for a regular developer making significant changes. If anybody on the project could just come up and said this thing would be so cool Id love to make it the project would end up an abomination of halfassed features.What is and what is not in the project is long since decided and no developer passion has any say in this right now except for one thing  if the people working on the code are motivated to actually make a good game its good for all of us.

6264448,0,t1_cz1nj6r,My rules are similar  yet at the same time vastly different. Rule  Sprint everywhere inside a city. Dodge duck dip dive and dodge. Observe your surroundings and know your exit routes. Rule  Talk First. If they have an Eastern European accent be wary. If they are a squeaker be very wary or shoot them in the face.Rule  Avoid the roads. Use the tree linings along the road rivers or electricaltelephone poles.Rule  Dont waste time with camps. If needed have a small cache. I find camps useless because they glitch or get raided easily. Its not so bad when  person finds a camp but when  person finds a camp and announces it on their team speak... there goes all that hard work to some  year old kids. Rule  If going to become a bandit never KoS. Stalk your prey they may have  friends tailing them.

6493757,0,t1_czqycgw,gt So that said I didnt want to talk too much about the kind of performance gains weve seen with the new renderer because again this has only been tested internally on the hardware we have on the settings we have and theres literally hundreds of thousands of people that cycle through DayZ every month.gt Like you might see say between I dont know  to  thousand concurrents but of those concurrents its a much larger pool cycling in and out. So thats a huge user base to ensure that both hardware and software configurations are working properly for and thats why Im very hesitant to commit to any specific gains.gt But weve been looking at as Eugen my associate producer mentioned earlier weve been looking at some dense scenes and we are seeing upwards of  frames. Now thats midrange midrange settings on a midrange card and that is in a dense scene. Im not  sure whether thats the new Cherno or Novo and areas like Berezino and so on and so forth but it is a typically lower performing area.Brian Hicks,dayz,czr03u5,3,t5_2ty3s

If your role is not in any way associated with one part of the game why would they just stop doing what they were paid to do? Producers already have a list of things this game will have. In this case a bottle of car oil. Obvisouly the person in charge of making the model has done their part and made said model. Why should they stop when someone else is in charge of fixingimplementing the way the bottle of oil will be used? Just because they have a model does not mean the feature is up and running either.

6770067,0,t1_d0jniy1,I dont want to attack you personally but I think you like many misunderstand how development works.Usually developers have sprints where each member of the team iterate on the features  area they work on and at the end of this sprint the code they work on is merged into a build. This build will then be internally tested. It is at this point where the team at large will see whether their code either works flawlessly introduces bugs causes performance issues etc etc. That merge could have happened yesterday for all we know and now  Hicks is reporting the findings. They likely had a list of bugs  performance issues to squash with the renderer that were completed but upon the merge with the rest of the team the build had performance issues that were not previously present. Its impossible to know for sure but I doubt they knew fully a week ago that they wouldnt be able to deliver.,dayz,d0jo269,16,t5_2ty3s
6770302,0,t1_d0joa08,As it will during Beta. When all optimizations will hit and be done to get ready for ..The thing with low FPS currently isHigh CPU usage low GPU thread usage DX and an old engine.Hitting FPS in the mod is because a lot of the buildings are just boxes with textures on.DX is currently able to pull off something between k drawcalls on a well optimized game.How much DayZ is able to pull off Im not sure of.DX is able to get up to K I think.DX K.And when designing a gameworld there a lots of things to think of when optimizing. Currently in Legacy everything within a certain distance is drawn when you look in any direction.With the new system implemented in Arma  engine and Im pretty sure is also gonna be in Enfusion is the ability to tag certain structures with a Bounding Box. Saying that whenever you are outside this box everything inside it will not be rendered. When inside it will be rendered but everything outside it will not. These are systems that are in any gameengine to give worlddesigners the ability to optimize a city or village. If not everything your camera sees will be drawn and then cap out on the max drawcall the Graphics API can handle in this case DX.So Im very excited to see what theyre coming up with in regards to documentation when releasing modtools as to what we have to work with when creating new worldsmaps. Because these things needs to be considered or else everyone is gonna have bad FPS no matter what system youre running on.PS If Im totally talking out of my ass then Im sorry. But please point out if Im totally wrong or missing something.,dayz,d0jp0th,2,t5_2ty3s

6776403,0,t3_48jcxi,I actually wouldnt mind silly graffiti penises and swastikas included. It would add flavor and customization to the game. If the players and developers are worried about this they should work towards locating and removing that stick lodged somewhere deep into their intestines. Theres silly graffiti all over the place in real life and some of them are indeed penises and swastikas.Now the actual immersionbreaking problem is the fact that spray painting walls works a little bit different in real life in comparison to just moving a cursor on the screen. Making a convincing spray painting simulation would be a nice chunk of work. If they were to add spray painting though this would be a must because otherwise every drawing would look like shit and detract from the games visual style. ,dayz,d0ke0fy,2,t5_2ty3s

When you walk up to the body to loot it no option comes up because the server says you are too far away.When you log back in too close the body just slides or moves back into that same spot however if you log in from a good distance when you run up to the body it will be at the top of the hill for example where you actually shot the guy and it wont slide because the client has set the physics of the body to off,dayz,d0knyns,1,t5_2ty3s

I saw Sacriel using one and seeing as he sits through the game code I knew there must be reason. I just still find players with full Mountain packs with bags of soda and food no matter what server even on Old School DayZ Hardcore First Person. It boggles the mind especially with the abundance. If youre not Healthy  without carrying any food and Hydrated  without carrying no more than a Canteen youre doing it wrong. Just eat as you find food to keep the energized up and spam wells and keep a canteen or pot which I will now do thanks for the tip spare. You literally just need a Vest or the Attachable pouches  slot clothing and a Courier Bag which isnt even that essential. Other peoples inventory management bugs me haha. Carrying so much ammo of varying types Sodas useless items etc. Obviously if they have a goal in mind car repair heading back to their stash it might make sense. I could understand picking up ammo for a gun you might find but sometimes its just ridiculous. As well as keeping the lowest possible profile so no melee weapons or big bags it must be a nightmare in a PVP situation having to deal with all that. Even reloading mags I keep  slots spare and the ammo for it next to it with nothing else. Makes it a  second process which would take others  of juggling their inventory.,dayz,d0o0s4n,3,t5_2ty3s

7032829,1,t3_4by7es,sigh... not to be THAT guy but I feel like you guys missed the point... Yes low FPS was terrible  but thats not whats game breaking whats game breaking is the drastic drop in framerate... it just so happens that today the FPS goes from    in areas.  But now with the new engine we have a  FPS drop... from   .  So it feels like the new engine really improves the FPS in already fine areas and marginally improves the FPS in currently low FPS areas  but the FPS drop now is MUCH greater... and its going to make the game feel ever more disjointed...Why are we not fixing the problem that causes the FPS to drop so drastically in very certain areas.  The new engine just feels like were trying to put a hat on to cover the receding hair line  rather than get a hair transplant and fix the problem to begin with.  well that was a weird analogy  I just compared DayZ to male pattern baldness.Edit Lots of disagreement and downvotes  but what else could I expect here   Anyhow  well all see after the engines been out for a bit if youtubers and reviewers dont come back and say yeah its been a nice improvement but the frame drop still makes the game exceptionally difficult to play ...

7263145,0,t1_d239m0w,Quick history lessonDean Hall creates this mysterious new game called DayZ mod.  Its amazing.  It starts off small but word gets out quickly and soon its got  million people playing.  Its different fun exciting intense its the first sandbox zombie apocalypse game that has consequences for your actions.  It encourages teamwork but its ruthless.  Vehicles are hard to come by zombies are a threat and bandit squads terrorize the coast while hero squads fight for the people who cant defend themselves.  Its also unique in that you can take your character to a different server so you can take on other squads raid peoples camps and meet new people around the world without losing your progress or having to start fresh.  It was great.  But then the hackers came.  Since ArmA  has a client based architecture where players cause server events such as spawning zombies in their proximity the hacks are heinous.  Devastating.  Mass teleportations nuking ChernoElektro parachuting cows oh the humanity!  All of this takes place on the public hived servers and it became so prevalent that you couldnt even be on a populated server for  minutes without losing all your shit to some stupid hacker.  But then they introduced private hives.  At first its the savior of DayZ mod.  No server hopping no ghosting tighter admin control white listing its the cure to the cancer that is the completely hacked game DayZ mod.  At first it was great but unbound by the rules of the public hive servers admins realized that by adding a perk here or treat there they could get people to come back to their server.  So it began spawn with mapcompass then spawn with enfield hey how about double vehicles then  daytime next it was SPAWN WITH DMR!   VEHICLES!!! SELF BLOOD BAGGING!!! and so on.  It literally became impossible to find any private servers running vanilla settings even admins that put vanilla on their server name were doing bullshit like doubling vehicle spawns and adding buildings to various locations.  The hardcore game lost its integrity.  It became a mess of easymode servers competing for the most players.  It was all about instant gratification PvP.  The real vanilla private hives emptied out and most of them shut down.ampnbspIn the midst of this other maps and submods were born.  Namalsk DayZero Origins Epoch and so on.  Some were still hardcore in terms of the amount of weapons and vehicles Namalsk DayZero while others focused on more military gear base building and currency Epoch Overwatch Breaking Point.  However a lot of these submods and maps experienced the same fate as DayZ mod.  Soon every EpochOverpoch server had  helis!  vehicles!  Spawn with DMR!!! and so on.  Some like Namalsk and DayZero stuck to their roots but have all but died off.ampnbspAfter SA released and a bunch of mod players were disillusioned many went back to the mod.  Most went to the populated EpochOverwatchOverpoch servers that are primarily easymode PvP daytime servers but some wanted the old school vanilla DayZ experience again myself included.  One day we realized that all the hackers had left the mods public hive to terrorize SA players.  All of a sudden there were a bunch of DayZ mod public hive servers that were hacker free.  Public servers guaranteed for the most part that they were running vanilla settings with no additions.  Eureka!  We can play the game the way its meant to be played again!  However HFB the hosting company that BI was using to host the public hive database was about to go under.  People pleaded with Dean Hall and BI to move it back it up whatever but they didnt.  HFB shut down and all of a sudden  years of DayZ mod legacy disappeared overnight.  No way to bring it back.  So some of the public hive servers converted to private hives but kept vanilla settings.  Theres still a few out there like US and DayZ Europa and they still maintain high population.,dayz,d23ro82,11,t5_2ty3s
7267793,0,t1_d24ad65,It sounded like a Jerry Bruckheimer film of how you described the explosion.   By the way I never played the mod really played at a friends house and I plan to install it into my PC soon but why couldnt the server owner just reset the loot so new players could have a chance at survival? This is what I experienced on some Private servers recenlty where I found no vehicles or any decent weapons because I felt that the maximum cap of a certain type of rifle or barrel or vehicle had been taken already so new guys like me would have a hard time getting anything decent. Was this one of the big problems of the Mod where people just hoarded everything and there was nothing left for new players to get? Was there ever a formula or solution to fix these types of ingame things from happening? Or did you ever experience a situation where youd think Damn everythings gone. Im outta here. Ill go to another server. ,dayz,d24aq4o,1,t5_2ty3s

Devs have leaked info that the enfusion engine is on the horizon but the majority of it is yet to be materialized for us to enjoy.

There are the people who wont recognise facts even when put in front of their eyes and that works for the people defending DayZ and those here just to hate on it.There are those who have literally no idea about DayZs development who have found themselves here through one of the larger gaming subreddits and they make angry posts about things they heard elsewhere and then leave without saying a word when corrected.

Weve received outstanding support from the community through both extensive bug reports on our Official Forums and large amounts of server crash and performance data on the Experimental Branch servers themselves.gt gt The team has been working hard on isolating several specific server crashes from the experimental branch servers that we are unfortunately unable to reproduce internally.

Well be using this data on Monday but in the mean time we will be switching the Experimental Branch servers to the last known good . build for the weekend.gt gt No ETA as of this moment on experimental server downtime but we will let you know just as soon as they come back online and the client update is ready.gt gt Thank you again for your continued support!,dayz,d356qin,10,t5_2ty3s

Mod comes outwow so innovative this would be a great game we just need to fix these  or  issues than it will be perfect! Game is sold on steam hey the zombies still run through walls going up and down stairs breaks your legs and we had to remove zombies but at least the devs added in the ability to bind other players and forcefeed them rotten food and bleach! Rocket leaves because the community chases him oway from a passion project its ok guys its only been years and almost none of those original  problems are fixed but they keep adding in more hat and jacket models weeeee! I would go on but i think ive made my point. If you like the game fine but this game is a perfect example of devs trying too hard to please everyone and it ruining the product as a whole.

7621898,0,t1_d387sew,Also I make sure I put the loose ammo for my Primary in the first available slots in the list of clothing containers with nothing else inside it if possible and then minimize everything else like backpack etc with essentials on the hotbar. Its just become habit now. That way when Im reloading mags in the heat of the moment its as simple as drag to the only open clothing container gt drop gt drag ammo in gt done. Similar to morphine in pants if I have  mags for the same gun Ill split them between containers in case one gets damaged. Little things that I think will be more relevant once item damage and location is tweaked in the future. When Im looting people I have zero idea what their Inventory Management is other than throw random shit in places that fits. and this happened on the mod with Armas awful inventory it works for mil sims not survival games fantastically quite often too where carrying mags in backpacks unless you had like  was relatively pointless as they had to be in your main inventory IIRC.

The idea is to have players moving back and forth across the map so they run into each other and have interactions. Finding guns outside of military locations isnt hard.

That means basically no gameplay updates in   and . By that time many other games will have come out and this game in general is already outdated.An early access game should have a finished engine before it is released. Otherwise they basically lied to us. I am happy to play a role in ongoing game development with bugs and all.

7831172,0,t1_d3w94fa,From my understanding I could be wrong they needed the money to actually develop the game as Bohemia had all of their budget into developing ArmA and didnt actually realize DayZ would be such a success until after it became available on Steam. With the money from the launch of the game they were able to buy smaller companies and employ more developers to work on the game and balance the budget to continue development of the game at least  years after launch for no extra charge. You could also blame Dean Hall for this as he wanted to follow a similar development style to Minecraft which meant releasing the game very early into development. His vision for the game from what I remember reading was low and goals had changed postlaunch and the vision for the game had expanded therefore causing a longer development cycle.EDIT  I just wanted to mention that what Im saying in no way excuses the slow development progress of DayZ while its not nearly as bad as people make it out to be the devs have not even completed everything in their Q roadmap of ,dayz,d3wahou,1,t5_2ty3s

7900567,0,t1_d441flj,What you can do? Roleplay the shit out of this game! That is what I do.It rains and I dont have a raincoat on me? Find a hiding spot and wait the rain out maybe make yourself a fire when you have the stuff for it. Explore the map make up stories why there are  jackets in this tiny hood go for a fishing run first you have to find the stuff for it tho so  travel the map not running you cant look at your sourroundings while running I barely ever run unless I am hunted by a zombie or a player Go and hunt animals and feed yourself from what you got out of it Build a tower you of haystacks if you found that hayhandle it is much fun! Try to navigate just by signs sun starts and knowledge and I dont mean just the usual I have to get north quick routes you probably already know without a map I mean travel like hey that over there looks intresting lets go there! if you find other players try to interact with them more often than not you can trade with them exchange some stories about your travel you might get robbed or killed but it is really worth it to not just KoSAn example for that would be yesterday I got engaged by  hostile looking guys who wanted to rob me I greeted them dropped by weapons gave them some ammunition for their weapons they traded one of their guns they didnt had ammo for with one of mine where I didnt had ammo for and they run away letting me live and we exchanged nice infos with each other. Stuff like that happens  out of  times if you engane people the right way. Shure you will get killed as soon as you get cocky or behave even a bit hostile but if you stay nice they sometimes even give you food without taking any of your stuff even tho they intended to rob you.DayZ is one of the verry few games you can have much fun just roleplaying the shit out of it you just have to try it heck I even look for a toilett ingame if I have to go to it irl.,dayz,d443j9d,-1,t5_2ty3s

7953105,0,t3_4o6epw,I do not believe this is not the main reason we have better fps. We get better performance because the renderer is no longer tied to the server. Other reasons include occlusion but weve had that since A and it has never impacted fps this greatly.Among others these are the key features we have better frames. Renderer no longer tied to server e.g. load single player map in A and compare fps to the same multiplayer map Better multicore support game is able to utilize more resources DX  has better support for offloading tasks to the GPU DayZ is a CPU intense game every rendering task it can offload makes the CPU less of a bottleneck.Credit where credits due the new renderer is way more beautiful then a simple occlusion improvement.,dayz,d4a05cs,46,t5_2ty3s

Like DayZ can be fun being retarded but not when you are trying to play tactically as a squad and safely loot the NWAF or something.Like I have a teamspeak I frequent where a good  to  of us play DayZ some more than others. We go to different subchannels if we are too far away from each other to avoid useless chatter. We might mess around from town to town but we know when we need to play seriously and tactically.

8075390,0,t3_4odwye,I wouldnt recommend Dayz to anyone as it stands.I started playing when . was released and it was total dogshit. While Hicks might say that some players look fondly at . with rose tinted spectacles I think you would find if you did a survey that  thought it was garbage and the player base reduced a lot.I rejoined at . and had great fun on this patch. The main thing holding the game back was the FPS. comes out and fixes the frames makes the game more playable from a PvP standpoint and..............they then fuck up the loot and the coast. Now you can spend hours looting  hours and struggle to put a gun together. Loot doesnt seem to respawn until a server restart.Combined with taking away all of the decent loot spots military where before even if it had just been looted you could find something useful rather than just clothes the chances of meeting players at high risk areas has gone down and made the game less fun.I really have no clue what the dayz developersBrian Hicks was thinking when taking the game back towards ..It suggests that the company doesnt listen to the community and consistently does daft things that make the game worse.Its pretty incredible that with all the work and effort that has gone into dayz SA it is still not as good as the mod according to mod playersSo the renderer is good as is the new UI but the ideas the company come up with are retarded and drive people away from the game.If they had left the loot as per . plus added in the new guns etc the game would have been a lot more fun.I understand the game is alpha and needs tweaking but the dayz dev team need to understand the idea of if it aint broke dont fix it ,dayz,d4nqzx5,1,t5_2ty3s

They dont just go in a straight line and then drop. when zeroing for m its taking into account that the bullet will arc upwards a little bit so thats where the weapon will aim for with the iron sights or scope.

So I think thats why most people skip it. Also there is just so much to search through there that it is really just overwhelming looking for loot therewaste of time. Like I could probably get to the NWAF in the time that it would take for me to search about  of Novo for loot.In terms of sniping in Novo there is like a radio tower kind of southeast of the Town hall building on a hill in the woods.

8398069,0,t1_d5ras43,No my internet is fine. I can agree to say I overexaggerated a bit. But IMO its not worth the risk shooting moving targets if they dont run straight at you or away form you both because of desync that depending on the server either is really bad or or not so bad and that the risk of missing is too big anyway. You cant say that desync has almost no effect on where your bullet goes. Its as simple as the server predicting where someone is and your client saying he is somewhere else that in DayZ is very prevelant when running. You the client will see someone running around but the server cant catch up because so much is happening across the map that the hitbox lags behind the player by a random distance. This happens almost all the time. Sometimes the hitbox is almost on the player you see and hitting moving targets is easier and sometimes its  feet behind and its almost impossible.I am not a person who cries when I miss. ,dayz,d5rb023,2,t5_2ty3s

8525793,0,t1_d679l0a,There is a far larger variety of items but the economy that controls them rewards those who travel toward the North West as that is considered a high tier area versus the coast which is extremely low tier. Overall the quantity of total items and the number of potential spawn points have significantly increased since . Essentially there are more items but they are also more spread out.As far as vehicles go there wasnt any in  but imo vehicles arent worth it yet as there are several nasty bugs affecting their physics and drivability. Zombies much like the items are in higher quanitities but also have to cover an additional km worth of new towns and cities therefore lowering the density found previously. . however aims to change this by creating a hybrid spawning tech similar to the DayZ mod.Final Point As DayZ approaches . its going to provide an experience that forces players inland and involves some rather intense PVE survival situations in which the player will have to fight off disease starvation dehydration hypothermia infected ai animal predators and other players all before finding enough gear that would make it easier. This level of hardcore vanilla gameplay is what the devs specifically Brian Hicks are aiming for and it will be offset by various mods and x loot vehicles and guns servers created by the nonhardcore community.,dayz,d67ac8g,5,t5_2ty3s

And besides when you kill someone a lot of his items get ruined and therefore become useless to you. There is just much more you can get by not shooting at someone even if sometimes you get shot and killed.The type of people I cant understand are those who camp near Bases or whatever and wait for  hours just to kill someone hide the body and continue to wait. I had few friends also who were doing that.

8623552,0,t3_4xyc4l,I like stuff like this. I was kicking around that big industrial area near Novo as a new spawn and thought what a shame it was that there wasnt really any reason for me to go into most of those lovely big buildings. I think it would be cool to have special dynamic spawn points and each could have multiple potential loot sets associated with it. So there might be something there or there might not be anything at all. There could be a lot of these spawn points in all sorts of places to inspire exploration. Even in the middle of a forest or at the corner of a beach.  Special loot sets might be a hunting backpack and a kitted out Mosin with ammo or a military backback with ghillie suit and stuff  a tent and cooking kit etc etc.So you could have maybe  of these spawn points with a  chance of a special loot set spawning at each and a suite of maybe  or so special loot sets. This should be fairly easy to implement I think. Just a little bit of application logic and some new persistent data structures to hold the relevant data about location and special loot sets. This is a really good idea.,dayz,d6jjnpw,3,t5_2ty3s

I hate hot weather personally so summer is literally hell for me.I literally get pretty much drenched when I work. But in terms of being soaked in the heat. It sucks. You would think it would cool you down but since you are running around and the cold water that soaks into your clothes just becomes warm as well... You cant tell the difference between the water soaking your clothes and your sweat. Basically you just become soaked in warm water and it makes it worse.Edit Now that I think of it... Wind is really the only thing that helps me cool down besides sitting in my car with the AC on or shoving my head in our fridges freezer. So I hope there is a wind mechanism at some point that relates to heating up and cooling down as well as a wind mechanic that influences projectiles i.e high winds will distort your shots etc..,dayz,d6vgln7,4,t5_2ty3s

8734013,0,t1_d6xdlce,I played DayZ shortly after it was released. It was fun until I knew the map like the back of my hand. I wasnt getting scared anymore. The mod reached its limit for me. Then Epoch came along and elevated the stakes much higher.SA took from vanilla DayZ and tried to go from there but it ended up in being a buggy snoozefest.  years went on and the game is more boring than when the Alpha was launched. At least back then the map was somewhat new again.Now the novelty of the redesigned map is gone and so is my desire to play this crappy game.I just wish I could go back and stop me from getting hyped with the standalone which the Dean dropped shortly after he started.When the creator steps down from making his mod come to life as a standalone game you know its not going anywhere.,dayz,d6xec7p,2,t5_2ty3s

8797192,0,t3_50eckb,Coastal interactions are the cancer of dayz imo.There is no care for life no risk no adrenaline every second person you meet is a troll  to me that is far from what i call fun.And the reason DayZ is losing players is because the game isnt complete just like EVERY update since its release players jump on try the new features and go on to play something else until a new patch is released rinse and repeat.It will continue to go on this way until the final day that DayZ is no longer updated which the devs already said they will continue to do so free of charge with NO added DLC fees for AT LEAST  YEARS AFTER .  and this does not include the countless amounts of mods that will also be free and draw in millions more in profit for bohemia interactive.Im in no way shape or form disheartened to hear that someone who plays dayz strictly for coastal interactions is now reluctant to jump on a server i play in. The way i see it it just makes room for  more player that i can encounter up north for some true adrenaline and emotion this game allows you to conjure up like no other game out there.,dayz,d75aweq,1,t5_2ty3s

Jump scares from infected when some are too slow and silent for you to notice them  as opposed to always seeing them running towards you screaming. Fear of getting hit by a decayed infected because you can catch deadly diseases  as opposed to always having a meta knowledge of approximate damage inflicted. Taking the chance youre safe behind the fence by observing the state of the infected  as opposed to all AI behaving exactly the same at all times Being able to push away or take weak infected out with a single hit  as opposed to all AI having the same health Sometimes having luck on your side that the infected you encountered had impaired hearing or vision  as opposed to all AI simultaneously locking on to you like missilesI get a sense you are now just arguing for the sense of arguing so lets just agree to disagree.,dayz,d7o56td,0,t5_2ty3s

9124642,0,t3_5577cx,Has there ever been mention as to how bases have even been thought about working? The best analogy for now would be Rust I guess but Rust has only individual hives no public hive that you can jump across with a character. Once bases are a thing in DayZ people will either play on private hives or if they do play on public they will likely always try to get into the same server unless they are farming loot. It would also make me think about sleepers. Is it always going to be the case that DayZ will log you out and at least what is on your person is safe or will they bring in the concept of sleepers and your character will remain in the server when you are not there. All that said as a lone wolf player I am way more interested in better ways to hide my gear than a blue tent that can be seen amongst the wilderness backdrop from a mile away.

9404308,0,t3_59f5wx,The DayZ Standalone map port to Arma III no longer works with the . version of DayZ. This is in part due to the render update in DayZ and also the Apex update for Arma. You can still get the map to work with the . version of DayZ but you will be missing a lot of added towns and visuals that the most recent version of DayZ has.As for cinematic clips my best suggestion is to first go into your settings and turn off chat notifications. This can be done by navigating to configure in the pause menu and then unchecking all the boxes at the bottom of the options screen keep in mind this will not remove character status i.e. hungerthirst.Next turn off head bobbing unless you want the chase scene effect and go into your video settings. I personally like to crank everything up except Rotation Blur. You can play with Bloom a bit if you want some nice light scatters and good visuals with your shots. I would highly suggest running antialiasing if possible.Once youre in game you can hit tab to remove your toolbar. To get rid of the weird oval cursor in front of you youll have to turn your head to the side in firstperson unless youve got mad postediting skills. You will unfortunately be pretty limited in the type of camera movements you can do. Panning is definitely achievable via running or jogging and still shots work excellent if you stand still. Remember to go crouched or prone to help add different depth to your shots and to look up or down to provide different angles.Unfortunately unless we get admin tools we will most likely not be able to freefly around the new Chernarus for a while. This means that aerial shots and fast moving pans are most likely out of the question.Hopes this helps man good luck.,dayz,d9829iu,2,t5_2ty3s

9875314,0,t3_5gphuk,I havent really had any SUPER memorable moments in DayZ.I mean Ive had good ones but I started playing DayZ probably  months after I had played various Arma  mods and the fear of death had sort of subsided.I do have a memorable from Breaking Point though going to copy paste it from their forums. Probably going to look like shit since Reddit seems to hate it when you try to break up your text to make it more readable but what the hell.And since I actually got responses afterwards I can tell that there were five parties in this fight. The gas station shooter the heli with crew myself the Hunter with two players and the ATC crew. The guys in the Hunter were weirded out as shit knowing they got two or three kills in the ATC but there were one extra body.And just to put it into context EU is an Altis First Person server which since the mod was slowly dying even back then wasnt particularly populated. And Blackfoots are AI only helis that crash and spawn loot.This is a long ass post but I thought itd be fun to share. Maybe somebody appreciates the story of a noob experiencing his first multiple party engagement. Ive admittedly had some fights before played the game for a bit a few months ago none of my friends liked BP and the loneliness got to me   and racked up  kills with a . kd ratio. Even had one vs encounter in which I even managed to survive while getting two kills and getting some of the loot with me.  It was a pretty funny moment we sort of just bumped into each other while going somewhere else and all of us just froze for a second before I ended up victorious. But still with my tail between my legs sprinting away from a horde of zombies and with the last party members bullets crackling past me.But I wouldnt call any of those encounters real fire fights they werent particularly chaotic. They were all either over almost as soon as they started or pretty calculated and straight forward. Today was different.Since I got back I started playing on EU.Anyway Ive kept some of the more important stuff while migrating but had grown tired of my Silenced MXM DMR SpecOps and have wanted to try and get a hold of a better marksman rifle and with better I mean cooler looking Ive already got an M and M but havent bothered using them much. So I have scoured some ranger barracks and heli crashes but have only found my third damn negev a bugged M Block  a thousand FNs low tier military loot and tons of Blackouts.So I decided to head of to the Central Airfield since while Ive read that the loot is of marginally lower quality the quantity is a lot higher and they seem to respawn every now and then. Besides I might get into some PvP. Id been receiving pot shots occasionally over the day from people setting up to camp probably over  rounds but hadnt actually gotten hit yet.And about an hour ago I returned yet again to have a look for some decent weapons to lay my hands on and I approached the western ATC. It seemed to have been untouched since the restart two hours earlier.There was nothing of interest inside but while scouting the area from the windows I noticed both of the other ATCs had their doors open. It struck me as odd that nobody had done the same to the tower I was in.I was suspicious but not overly cautious in retrospect I guess I shouldve been because it shouldve been obvious why not all  ATCs had been looted the same way. After scouting out the area for a few minutes and not noticing anything else to sound off any of my inner alarms I proceed to descend the tower and start making my way towards the central ATC and the terminal. I dont get much further than  metres before I hear a vehicle coming in at full speed. I dont even go prone I just stop dead in my tracks to cause as little movement as possible and I seem to go off unnoticed as a fully functioning Hunter drives across the tarmac eastbound.I contemplate whether it would be possible for me to lay low and wait for him to disembark to loot. Getting my hands of a vehicle of that caliber would be pretty damn sweet. But just as he turns north for a uturn at the eastern ATC hes getting lit up. I realise the Hunter probably saved me from ending up in a fair bit of trouble.While I cant see whoever is shooting at him their position is glaringly obvious. I range it in to about  metres and soon enough someone has exposed themselves to the windows in the west by trying to show as little as possible of himself towards the Hunter in the north. I fire off a few rounds and get rewarded with No Points Gained as Im playing as an Independent rofl.Since I went here for loot and PvP Im not quite ready to leave yet. Im still willing to risk the gear I have to either get my hands on that Hunter or loot the guy I took out. Its risky but Im sure the pay out if I succeed will be worth it.I dont take more than  steps before I hear an explosion in the ATC and stop to have a quick glance followed by mid to high caliber marksman shots from behind me. I quite literally shit my pants and hit the ground thinking this is it. I had hoped to get some more fun out of this.A couple of seconds pass and I realise I heard gun reports not bullet cracks. Hes not shooting at me Im just in the line of fire. Albeit a half a dozen meters or so underneath and with some soft cover in the way. Yet again I realise that not only had the Hunter saved me from trouble it had literally saved my life. I had been a sitting duck inside cross fire in the central ATC.I scout around a bit underneath the foliage deduct that he has to be at the gas station and think that that rifle of his sounds very nice. So nice in fact that I think Id like to have it. So I crawl all the way from inbetween the western and central ATCs up to the eastern side of the gas station at least a few hundred metres.  One of the doors is already open but its made of glass and Im pretty sure that type of door only leads to the first floor. Probably a zombie who walked out after hearing the sniper fire.I know that even if he could exit to the south theres no way he will expose himself to the Terminal and I also understand that he could be sitting in there for half an hour or  seconds so I decide to stay put. Considering the amount of bullets he has put out its probably sooner rather than later. Not two minutes later one of the doors open up and a barrel peeks out but he doesnt even look my way. Not that I think he wouldve seen me lying prone in the grass with a ghillie obstacles helping to break out the silhouette around me.He runs out and sprints in the opposite direction. A couple of bullets later he drops dead. As Im sprinting towards his corpse jumping over the obstacles blocking the way I can not only hear the Hunter speeding towards my location but a fucking Ghosthawk coming in as well. I guess he had a pretty good reason for wanting to take off.I dont even have time to loot him I duck to cover inside the buildings and try to think of the best approach to the situation. They dont know Im here but Im in literally the same row of houses as the shooter and they dont know hes dead.Can I run? Theyre too close for that. And theres no way in hell Im leaving that rifle. I dropped two guys and Im not going to give away both corpses. So Ive got to make a stand Ive got to rely on my skills in shooters and the fact that they dont know in which of the houses Im in. Shitty odds but what can you do. But Im blessed with luck yet again the Hunter makes a uturn just as he passes and goes back the way he came and the Ghosthawk is just circling around in a large area.I loot the corpse to find an M SASS now that is a nice rifle. Following this I crawl probably another  metres to the roads of foliage and reeds that leads in and out of the airfield and exfiltrate the area.The only thing I encounter on the several kilometre long journey back to my stash is a Blackfoot steadily flying to his own inevitable demise. I ignore any thoughts of greed and stay on my course home.,dayz,dauryq7,1,t5_2ty3s

9968187,0,t1_db6txyg,There are different kinds of immersion though. You can be immersed in a character in a wider storyline the first Halo is a good example which seems more like what uJordUK is talking about but DayZ immersion is about feeling what the character does on both an unconscious and conscious level because the character in DayZ is you. Even if you are RPing a persona its still you thats getting shot at chased and fighting for survival and your body responds to that. In  years of gaming no game has ever come anywhere near to what I experience when playing DayZ and ArmA.

10025063,0,t3_5j4ugl,I think anything beyond fortifying existing structures tents and stashes could possibly have a negative effect on DayZ. Some players are already concerned with the effect stashes will have. I believe that base building is a novelty and the implementation of it would drastically change the style of play. Youd have far less traffic in cities less player interaction and much more time spent at your base or searching for others bases to raid why spend an hour looking for a gun when you can find an entire building full of loot?.Even looking at a game like Fallout  we can see that base building is neat and cool but ultimately it detracts from the essence of what the game is.As others have pointed out theres no meaning to death if you have  winchesters and thousands of rounds of ammo in your base.I really feel like full on base building is incompatible with DayZ and the implementation of such would greatly change the focus of the game in a way that is incongruent with the unique style of DayZ.That said cool looking concepts!,dayz,dbeakts,1,t5_2ty3s

You just arent trying. Search harder or get off the coast. Go look at the loot map on the front page the coast doesnt spawn shit because the whole point of the design of this map is that the best loot and highest concentration of loot is the farthest from where you spawn to promote moving around and having player interactions. Stop acting like a whiny child because the devs are actually making the game they planned on making rather than making the steaming pile of shit that would be created if they listened to the half baked moronic suggestions of this subreddit. If you think EASIER means BETTER then this is NOT the game for you my friend. The plan from the beginning has been for a brutal antigame that is extremely challening and punishing. Its been on easy mode for so long people have gotten it into their heads that this is the way DayZ was intended to be.When modding support comes in there will be the kind of super softcore server that you want but this is not part of the vanilla DayZ experience. ,dayz,dbfs6jd,5,t5_2ty3s

Ever seen the improvised weapons that have been made out of necessity by people fighting in warzones?That just shows you what people can come up with when in desperate times. Besides in DayZ we already have improvised weapons... Improvised Bow Improvised Spear etc BI is quite likely to add more improvised weapons to the game in the future.The mechanical building with the worktable will be accessible which will allow us to modifycraft weapons in the game. It was stated on a devblog awhile back IIRC.Improvised weapons that I can think of right now that may probably make it into the game are Nail bombstripwire grenades wire connected to a stick and the grenade pull ring?sound traps tin cans and other items that could make noise attached to a wire so many combinations could be made for sound trapsSpike traps using sharp sticks so when the infected chase after you through the streets you might be able to get a few with spikes dug into the ground sticking outwards or stuck through a barrel etc Walking Deads perfect example  I think you would have to maneuver around the traps yourself as they chase you in hopes of them getting hurtkilled by the spikes if they run into them. I dont think the infected are stupid enough to just walk into spikes as they are not mindless zombies but living people infected with a virus thats why they chase after animals to eat and why you can kill them with a shot to the chest.,dayz,dbrc9ru,6,t5_2ty3s

I managed to pull it off once back in  i believe it was  but havent been ably to complete it since. Something always happens to my stash before I finish so its a consent quest.

10148514,0,t1_dbubb28,The way I see Standalone you are basically forced to run straight to military installations or risk being unprepared for a player encounter Im not a very experienced player dont know the loot spawns like many talented standalone players do. I dont think this was the case with the mod and I will explain why. I think the main difference is the size of the map and the fact that in the mod most buildings were not enterable. I think I like the mod better because it is simply easier. Looting is simplistic in the mod and feels a lot less tedious than it is the standalone some people prefer the looting in standalone all power to them! Instead of having to go through each individual building for minimal loot as in the standalone you could sweep a small town for loot fairly quickly weapons spawned with a small bit of ammo and there were more antique weapons mosin lee enfield cz  that made looting towns in the mod much more rewarding and actually fun and somewhat exciting. You were constantly making progress towards the northern side of the map while in the Standalone it feels like the only place that has decent loot is military areas along with the deer stands which are few and far between. Obviously people do enjoy the standalone and I totally support that.,dayz,dbucr36,3,t5_2ty3s

If youre bright green energized and dark green hydrated youll start generating both but  blood goes up first and health goes once blood is full. What this means is you might get a bunch of blood back from reneration and your screen might be full of colour but your health will be low if you lose the energy or hydration before youre completely healed.Like colour is an indication for blood level the amount of screen blur is an indication of your health.

I understand the mod was different but now the game has evolved since then. If I have to spend my time looking on a map in a separate window then it takes away from the game itself. I understand if you are solo but playing with friends always takes forever to start up and a in game map would ease that problem.

I know some people wont agree on this with me and will argue along the line of arguments like this is your personal fault I can imagine hundreds or more scenaries and never get bored but if you break down encounters and possibilities dayz is not a good sandbox tool for RP. Also those claims are indeed extremly emotionaly biased and unsubstantiated in fact.The general problem with rp is also that you will always find people like Mr. Moon who wasnt even creative in what he was doing most of the time and basically doing sadistic shit to other people so he probably could wank off to his own videos.If you want good rp in dayz you need real tools and zeus to enable the players and GMs to create believable scenarios.

Specific actions in game can make the server crash if players exchange items just before they make it crash the can duplicate their items.

The devs made a decision to start from scratch on a tone of things and now we are seeing the fruit of that with the new rendered networking fixes and soon player controller. If you payed attention and I dont blame you for not doing so you would know there is a backlog of features and mechanics waiting on the player controller to be implemented. This development posses has been slow yes and you have a right to be disappointing that they deiced to take the long rout for a better product but I promise you that decision will be worth while for all of us.

Edit to respond to your editFYI Rust isnt even out of Alpha yet its not close to being finished at least not in the eyes of the devs. It simply has a lot more content than DayZ. Funnily enough Rust and DayZ also were released onto steam nearly a month apart.

10799708,0,t3_5ucn9d,Our community often uses out of game communication during groupsquad missions and usually take a pretty organized approach to our gameplay.We have a mission template called Hardcore Survival where we try to function as a hero group using only ingame comms information maps etc.  No out of game discussion about what happens ingame.  For example if someone dies we cant tell someone out of game only ingame.  We also cant discuss who has been to the campmeetup location out of game.Our approach and experience with this mission template is pretty fun but it does get boring after a while about  month max because it ends up being a bunch of lone wolf play if you dont sign on at the same time as someone else in the community.The way we organize the initial setup is we set our Mumble voicecomms comment to include a simulated Bug Out Plan.  This has basic information such as Bugout town cannot change during the event Radio channel cannot change during the event.  We perform this event in a muted channel where no one can talk.  It also allows us to see when someone is playing in Hardcore mode.Some active and passive communication tools we have used Flare guns Smoke Grenades Other signaling and lighting devices Notes for checkincheckout log Uniform recognition Wiggle  wave for friendly recognition at a distance Precommunicate our loottravel routes Lets loot  houses each and then meetup at XXXXX in  minutes. If we hear any shooting the meetup location will be XXXXX at the north end of town.The experience is quite immersive and can be fun!  Usually we will end up playing for  hours before finally meeting up at the simulated bugout location.

10866823,0,t1_de0u0hc,Dev UpdatePeterLast week we reached one of our internal milestones specifically the removal of SQF high level scripting language which was introduced back in days with Operation Flashpoint. When we started to work on standalone DayZ we heavily relied on SQF with its rich API of commands built over years of usage across Arma series. Original plan was to prototype and implement systems and mechanics we wanted to have in DayZ in it then hardcode them to Real Virtuality engine directly to gain performance back. This changed once decision to build new Enfusion engine based on previous RV and Enforce engines was made. Latter one used powerful and fast low level object oriented scripting language with its own IDE and therefore it was logical step to carry it over and improve it.ampnbspOnce it was production ready we start to rewrite all gameplay and support scripts from old SQF script to newly established Enforce script which offered us to become largely independent from programmers and to keep game open for modding. This process was quite difficult and tedious mainly because of missing backwards compatibility specific design and technical dependencies limitations found down the road and all that mixed together with our commitment to release playable version of DayZ in Early Access program. All these led us to maintain and develop basically two versions of game side by side  obsolete one for public to play in meantime and new one for us to make game as best as possible for public to enjoy later.ampnbspRecently new animation system began to be synchronized between server and client which was long awaited impulse for us to switch exclusively to all new mindset to push things forward internally. Now every piece starts to finally fall into place forming something I like to refer to as DayZ ..ampnbspThe King is dead long live The King... see you in Chernarus folks!ampnbsp Peter Nespesny  Lead Designer,dayz,de0u3do,11,t5_2ty3s

They ended up handcuffing me and wordlessly began running back and forth between me and my dead body force feeding me.

Killing AI characters would never give me the same feeling as killing another person. I think something like this would be amazing for a youtube series if executed properly but I do not think DayZ is the type of game to have a campaign. I rather enjoyed frankieonpcs videos of dayz despite some of them being obviously scripted and planned out they are entertainment someone like him could pull of a nice series storyline along the lines of this but I dont think DayZ should ever have an endgame or campaign.,dayz,de2yo1l,2,t5_2ty3s

11045165,0,t3_5xoucf,If you think about buying Dayz do it. You will have so much fun for countless hours... just read some reddit comments of the experienced people under a post of a guy that just started playing Dayz. Everyone will be like i wish i could just start the game all over again. Exploring the map no clue where i am or where i am heading. No idea where the best place for loot is. No idea how to get most important places on the map. These were beautiful times.The most negative reviews come from people playing the game for  or even  hours! do you think that they would play such a bad game for so long if they didnt enjoy Many people complain about the game beeing in Alpha for too long or no updates happening. They all forget about thefact that they had the ability to play the game from the very start. years development time is completely normal. In other games you just dont have the possibility to join the Alpha so early.Of course the game gets stale after a long time when there are no updates. But the developers had such a big task to rewrite the engine and rewriting some hard coded segments into a scripting language and building in the new sound system. You think that is done in a month? Spoiler it isnt.And with the next patch all these new elements will be forged together. Dayz will feel quite different when the new player controller is in the game idk if it comes in this patchor the next one Were so close to get a game that is finally very different from Arma and the beggining of the Dayz Standalone.I played many hours until I got mad at the devs for slow development speed and because there was nothing new in the game. So I took a break for some month.After this break Dayz felt great againand its really fun and im looking forward to the next patch.Everyone complaining about the slow update speed should shut up soon when the new Systems that i mentioned earlier are in game because then the spine of the Standalone is in the game and the Devs can work on bugfixing and adding some new content.And if someone is reading this that is  not amused with the speed the development is going just quit the game for some time i guarantee you you will come back after atleast half a year and will enjoy this game very much. just dont write the negative reviews because you have died to a bug and quit dayz because of it. Should i really remember you of the big banner that pops up when you start the game that warns you that the game is still in Early Access so bugs can happen and so on? alright thanksAgain to the people giving negative reviews  think about why you played the game for so many hours.TLDR  just DO IT! dont let your dreams be memes. just DO IT! seriously go for it.,dayz,dejy7t6,5,t5_2ty3s

11348774,1,t1_dfics9r,Dayz made millions just because it isnt done by the time they estimated doesnt mean it wont be finished or that you were lied to. In fact its proven theyre making progress on it and gutting the engine is a lot more work than recreating the mod. Id much rather have a full standalone title for  than the mod running on arma  all over again. Even if it takes  or  years because Ive played games in development and understand the work that goes into something like that. Player base also has no impact on how a game is developed when its already sold so many copies despite whatever made up understanding you have of game development. Comparing it to overwatch is kinda hilarious a huge studio a hundred times larger took their MMO project and scrapped it for an arena shooter. Its much easier to do that than grow a team from a dozen to almost a hundred while making a game thats also playable for users from day  and then after a year completely redo the engine something no game designers ever do or can afford to do period. Im not trying to argue with you so much as inject a little logic into the discussion before its bombarded by more comments about poor comparisons that have no basis in actual real world game design. To put it succinctly as possible people dont have the patience to see a game be made in front of them let alone one they can play at the same time. Most of the flared emotions come from that because people actually like the game and their perceptions of it dip with the lull in patches or lack of features or lack of time relevant progress to them in their own heads. I think if people never got to play Dayz until it was actually done youd see a very different atmosphere around the game but it would be an entirely different game altogether because Early Access is exactly what enabled them to make the game beyond an Arma  Dayz copy.  at least make a rebuttal instead of downvoting if you disagree you people are the reason reddit is garbage.,dayz,dfid2gf,-12,t5_2ty3s

11361989,0,t3_5yp8vo,Okay yesterday Ive purchased the required games to run DayZ mod. And after playing about  mins. I realized that the game sucks. I played DayZ SA on a private Russian project and I have to say that DayZ Standalone is way better than the mod. The mod is kinda so uncomfortable. Its missing so many animations and the existing ones look like that they are made by a  years old boy. And the retarded zombies are unbelievable. Basically I was trying to avoid them cause I used to play Standalone in which the zombies are hard to kill and they present a real threat then I decided to fight one. One hit with a crowbar and he is dead. I was like Okay maybe because I hit him on the head ran to another one and when he saw me he started running into random directions. So also the pathfinding system for the mod is fuckedup. So for whoever sees this Standalone. Just Standalone. Dont waste your money on the mod as its total unplayable garbage. Well at least thats what I think it is. Cause I care much about the animations and such.Edit Oh yeah I forgot to mention that almost all buildings are not enterable in the mod unlike Standalone.,dayz,dfjuz5c,1,t5_2ty3s

Many sadly have an entire account where they post nothing but shit about the game. If you do reply and take time to address their points it never seems to end well. But thats because its not criticism per se youre replying to with the aim of opening a dialogue suggesting things what have you. Criticism is good but when it has a point and that isnt the case all of the time. The times I do see constructive criticism I upvote if theyve been downvoted. I think with the sheer amount of people who just vent I can see why downvoting is a thing.

Often for the better but I appreciate the current state of the game. I love the direction SA is going. The pace can be slow but if you want faster paced action you can always go to military locations. I have no doubt that SA will be awesome when its done. Due to a few very tight bottlenecks progress has been slow.  Once those systems are in place the game will rapidly improve and I believe those systems are very close to implementation. That said  the current state is very enjoyable and has many features that were lacking in the mod.Barricading existing buildings sounds awesome but Im not a fan of base building  it disrupts the traffic flow of the map.,dayz,dfzbyr9,1,t5_2ty3s

11524872,0,t3_64ha0t,About how and what players used to do back in the dayz... At one time weve just fixed a Ural truck but a friend broke his legs by walking on stairs so since weve been like couple of minutes from Cherno weve decided to go in and see if we can find morphine to fix him up.Weve heard occasional shooting thatve grew into near nonstop firing by the time we parked the truck and two of us approached on foot peeking around the corner. Weve spotted two militarygeared players backtoback trying to hold back the rush of zeds obviously trying to conserve ammo and trying to move into the hospital.Then one of them ran out of ammo and quickly got overwhelmed which left the other guys back uncovered and they got rushed.So what a DayZ Standalone player would do? Most likely nothing then deal with the zeds and get their gear.Back in the days however we knew being medics were not even half as geared as these guys so we rushed back to the Ural then ran over the zeds we could took the others with silent methods while the two unconscious guys were screaming due to the wounds.Weve dragged them onto the Ural and made a hasty exit then tried to patch them up.Only one of them survived but itve made it a hell of an experience and became an epic moment that well always remember bout DayZ.Ive yet to have an epic memory of Standalone but I sure hope well get the required game mechanics thatd allow us to get there soon.,dayz,dg2ch3z,11,t5_2ty3s

I would have to agree that Rust is a breed of its own and I feel like Miscreated would be a bit better if they would get rid of base building and focus on fortifying or preconstructed object placement. Over time Ive really started to shun away from games that make you gather x wood to build walls. It becomes a serious grindfest and competition on who can build the most andor smartest. DayZ has a bit of a grind on it but the grind is journey not a chore. I hope when DayZ does start implementing more base building that it doesnt turn into Rust with ridiculous looking fortresses and sticks to a preconstructed objects tents watch towers specific houses etc.   ,dayz,dg6zysj,2,t5_2ty3s

11632445,0,t1_dgdpylg,Where Battle Royale games really succeeds is the way in which the gameplay flows for sure.Theres one problem I really have with DayZ that seperates it from everything else now which I feel the Battle Royale games have somehow mitigated because you dont have to really look for things theyre forced upon you even if its only one thing and you die pretty early on.There is no Whos shooting in Cherno? situations in DayZ anymore. It is what essentially made the mod so great and the community so strong at that time. That there was a community on servers and the very freeflowing gameplay still forced you to do certain things because of stuff like global chat as spammy as it could be sometimes because of the amount of people that would fully equip themselves and play in certain areas only and because of a general disregard for things that just currently impede progress like food drink wet cold hot despite the fact I think they should play a part in Standalone. In an effort to make the game more real the devs have essentially removed those things that has in turn removed the fullfilment of actually doing something on a single play through.

I think some people misunderstood this.As you could see from the steam reviews there are MANY people who expect a bug free game in early access with a nice experience playing it. I tried to think about it this way  someone who wants to buy the game takes a look at the steam reviews or this subreddit should not be quenched from all the negativity because this game is already very nice to play if you play around some bugs.Anyways thank you for your feedback we will keep it in mind for the next videos of this type,dayz,dgq9ur3,3,t5_2ty3s

11740294,0,t1_dgqr3g9,So whos more likely to have a more sound knowledge of the games development and better judgement of the state of the game and future progress? The people who follow every dev Tweet every Status Report every Trello update and forum post.or  The general market who maybe at most read a dev blog once a yearYou tell me. If the people here believe that the developers will deliver and they are the better informed ones who should you listen to? Its popular to hate DayZ.

The messages are now under the name Facebook User. This is why I feel extremely violated. This person acquired all of my personal info treated me like garbage all while maintaining his own anonymity.

11771996,0,t3_67wtgf,I personally didnt like the fact that he implied that a hunting rifle was  a sort of low level weapon. Winchesters and Blazes are some of the most sought after weapons.,dayz,dgudynz,3,t5_2ty3s
