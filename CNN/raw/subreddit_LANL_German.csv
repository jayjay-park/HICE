491019,0,t3_1zqqr6,It is one level above not knowing any German at all.  Youll keep working on increasing vocab. Youll start to learn how to form the perfekt past tense. You will learn about  more of the four German cases you know nominativ youll start to learn akkusativ and dativ.  You need to take the time to understand these because they never go away and only become more complicated the further you go applying them to not just nouns but adjectives pronouns etc but that is for A. Youll also learn modal verbs drfen knnen mgen mssen sollen wollen. If you know these things already it will be a good time to brush up and keep building vocabulary.  Aside from grammar and what I found helpful was learning how to deal with certain situations ex. asking directions ordering at a restaurant etc. are you looking at intensive classes? ,LANL_German,cfw2yyc,7,t5_2rd5y

556041,0,t1_cg3d69u,Dont be discouraged. Learning a language is a very personal endeavor. Yet the biggest hindrances are learning it in a class with too many students and also being instructed exclusively in German. The German past isnt really as complex as it seems. Also we are focussing on the  most important irregular verbs and solely on the Perfekt as thats all you actively need in daily communication to set a solid base for later. Its all about knowing what to concentrate on and making things very clear. Yet we are also struggling a lot as you will find in todays video. But thats just part of the game. We havent achieved our goal B exam with an  score yet but are still confident.Duolingo is not designed at least I hope for serious language works of beginners its a nice and really wellprogrammed languagegame. ,LANL_German,cg3h8as,3,t5_2rd5y

833129,0,t3_23nq1z,Ill second Trkisch fr Anfnger which someone else mentioned... Season  at least is quite entertaining. Other than that watching series dubbed in German that Ive already seen in English is actually quite helpful. That way you can have an idea of whats being said without having to use explicit subtitles as a crutch. Ive been told the dubbing isnt always so good as far as making realistic speech but I always figured it probably wont make much of a difference to a foreigner as long as youre not approaching motherspeaker proficiency.
