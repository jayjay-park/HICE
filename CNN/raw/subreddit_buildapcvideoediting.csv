10310183,0,t1_dccmz46,I cant seem to find the information on what storage the HP is using. The wiki here explains that its all about fast storage. REALLY fast storage. Over . GIGABYTES PER SECOND write and read speeds are needed with todays k codecs. Its all about MOVING data in this case video footage. AE will gain significant render speeds with PCIe SSDs. The Intel is a great start for that. WITH ALL THAT SAID make sure AE scratch disks are properly setup and that they are assigned to a PCIe SSD or RAID  depending on whats in the HP.,buildapcvideoediting,dccpr97,1,t5_3afy8
10563026,0,t3_5r98ty,Its a solid build for p. But youll need more than one SSD. Youll need one for OS and Apps one for scratch and one for final mass storage. For your purpose the number of cores means very little and you wont see any improvement.  Cores  physical and  threaded means youll want at least GBs of RAM to have a smooth workflow. Having less than GB per core is a bottleneck that is actually noticeable. So either TURN OFF Hyperthreading or get more RAM. In your case Id turn off Hyperthreading. For k youll struggle with anything less than GBs of RAM and a PCIe SSD. The Firepro is however outdated for k and will not be able to accelerate effects no matter how fast your PCIe SSD is. It has severely limited memory bandwidth even for p. Honestly a SkylakeKaby Lake build will outperform that old build straight up. Id think about it for a while. ,buildapcvideoediting,dd5fsjk,2,t5_3afy8
