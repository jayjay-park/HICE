580989,0,t3_20sbr6,Sounds like an interesting idea but the one thing I dislike in debates is how when you say you dont know an answer it is automatically taken to mean that your opponent won  I dislike the confrontational mentality that occurs in debates.But other than that it sounds like something I might be interested in.,religiondebate,cg6b9ww,6,t5_30mzs
586995,0,t1_cg6kggr,I dont subscribe to everything Lucas did and you are surprised that I may exclude some other authors?Some things just dont make sense. The Revelation did not touch everyone in the same way and some inclusions were clearly misguided.,religiondebate,cg6zugp,2,t5_30mzs
592211,0,t1_cg7kp6j,If youre using the definition of agnosticism that Huxley used then your definitions arent complete. Agnosticism deals with knowledge... Which conflicts with the three positions you put forth. Or rather dont match. Rejecting a claim is not the same as thinking the claim is false... ,religiondebate,cg7l6p9,3,t5_30mzs
612889,0,t1_cg9va64,Those two statements arent in conflict. Theyre not even addressing the same thing. Youre expecting the burden of proof to be what is required to PROVE that a position is true. Thats not how it works.Thats why I hate that its called the burden of proof only in a VERY loose sense of the word does fulfilling a burden of proof actually prove anything. I can think of one way that the terminology is actually accurate. Youre proving your point to the satisfaction of the person youre trying to convince. By the way check your wording on your last sentence. You either mistyped or you yet again misunderstood something I said. ,religiondebate,cg9xr4i,2,t5_30mzs

Where do you come up with this shit?Its the only thing thats been in contention the past several days.  ever post Ive made has been in response to you saying Well I brought it up and it is a criticism but I didnt bring it up for the purpose of criticizing it.A criticism is the act of criticizing.  If youre not criticizing it then its not a criticism.,religiondebate,chca6to,0,t5_30mzs

1380950,0,t1_cip8wvw,gtIve demonstrated that you were wrong about grammarI know thats your assertion but I made an argument that justifies my belief otherwise. The fact that I either cannot or simply have not demonstrated it to you as well is inconsequential. gtabout the historical meaning and present meaning of atheismagnosticismI remember you arguing as such but I didnt see evidence which was verifiable and conclusive enough to convince me of your point of view. gtand of the utility of defining the words the way you do versus the way I do.I recall that this was your position but you completely failed to convince me. Youve also failed to demonstrate that those constitute nearly every point Ive made so far. Now lets assume for a second just for the sake of discussion for shits and giggles that I was wrong about one of those things. This means that me being incapable of admitting that Im wrong is not an attack on my honesty which was what I thought you were attempting to do but rather my involuntary ignorance. If thats the case so what?,religiondebate,cipdx6j,1,t5_30mzs
