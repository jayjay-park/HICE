700380,0,t3_225ls0,This is going to be long mainly because I think the entire story needs to be understood to get the proposal. For those that dont want to read the wall of text TLDR  Neither of us understood how to handle a FWB situation at all.My wife is actually the one that started our contact  she found my Yahoo! profile online while I was in college I was up late working on a project and she was just getting home from work. At the point where we met we were both in a place where we were looking for more of a FWB type of situation because wed both just gotten out of bad relationships and were pretty focused on things her work and my degree. After a couple of weeks of online chatting we moved to phone calls which occurred nightly for a month or two. Then came the day we met up in person  May   damn right I remember this  I can tell you what she was wearing too!. We started going out to eat doing things as friendsetc. About two months in I realized I think I love this woman but because of the nature of how we started I said nothing. Another month goes by and its coming up on my st birthday  we go out and I have a couple drinks she abstains because shes still  and her company tested underaged employees for alcohol. Of course alcohol loosens the tongue and that night during a cuddle session I just say it. No hesitation on her part at all she turns to me and says the same thing back to me. months later we find a place to rent and are living together. What she didnt know is that I had already started making payments on a ring which took a long ass time because I was making hr part time. When I finally made the last payment and picked up the ring  we had just adopted a new puppy from the litter her dads dog had.Now here is a place where I feel the need to say we both have hot tempers and are both fairly stubbon individuals  which makes the fact weve made it work this long more amazing to me. The day I decided to propose we were fighting  but damnit I wasnt going to let that foil my plans see me being stubborn. I wrote a note Will you marry my Daddy? attached it to the puppys collar and sent her into the other room  where she was trying to ignore me. I yell Grab the dog shes got something again!. I hear Damnit whatd she get into this time?...then a second later what the he...OH MY GOD!. She comes running from the other room to find me on one knee with the ring. She drops to the floor punches me hard in the shoulder and I mean hard I had a nice bruise afterward crying and says Youre such an asshole I wanted to stay mad. Yes of course Ill marry you.. Tears on both sides now we became a tangled web of body parts on the floor.Itll be  years married this September we have two kids and never been happier.,MarriedLife,cgjvw39,2,t5_2u2h5

She could be in a place where she feels pressured to please you which also means coordinating getting the girls asleepoccupied which has put her in a place where shes more comfortable just avoiding the topic. Could be hormones my body responds poorly to sex while Im breastfeeding. Could be exhaustion. Really you just have to talk to her about it to see where shes at.,MarriedLife,cyh6ss1,2,t5_2u2h5
