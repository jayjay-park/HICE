11741780,0,t3_5f93o1,I picked up an open box Aeron from ebay on the cheap like  for fully kitted out. I wouldnt do it again from the same group apparently there was a lawsuit with HM a while back. They claim to have warranty but they dont that kind of stuff. The chair clicked until I got a very specific left angle torx driver that could fit in the space to tighten it but I also love it and wouldnt have anything else for my workspace ever again even if it meant buying full price. if you want high end for midranged prices honestly its the way to go. Going cheaper than that Id say go with the amazon basics taskchair type of thing. As for the cheap Udesk Ikea Galants used to be gold but you cant get them anymore new at least. The Bekant line is very similar though a bit harder to deal with from a modular perspective since their curves are more aggressive. I was looking for something very specific cheap Udesk with half depth on one side so I could reach over for whiteboard and the Bekant made it happen all for cheaper than a decent craigslist U desk that wasnt quite what I wanted.,homeoffice,dgqyldp,2,t5_2t46w
