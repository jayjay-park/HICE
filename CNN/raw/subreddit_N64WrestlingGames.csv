5561818,0,t1_cwmh91q,The one thing Ive really dug throughout most K games is the showcase mode though it has limited replay value. And its convenient to just be able to download CAWs haha. But then if I wanna tweak them I honestly havent taken the time to learnmaster their CAW system. ,N64WrestlingGames,cwmhsv5,1,t5_3a9ik

6464034,0,t1_czlbnax,OK... Chaz is the key....On June    Warrington now calling himself Chaz ridiculed the Beaver Cleavage gimmick and identified Mrs. Cleavage as his girlfriend Marianna Komlos in a shootstyle interview. Warrington and Komlos feuded with Meat and his female entourage then with Prince Albert. Warrington left Komlos on the September  episode of SmackDown! and she begged him to take her back throughout the night. On the September  episode of Raw Is War Komlos came to ringside with a black eye and it was implied that Warrington had beaten her. Over the following weeks Warrington would be on the receiving end of beatdowns from various wrestlers as well as being screwed out of matches by officials all of whom were angry at Warrington for allegedly beating Komlos. Komlos attempted to have police arrest Warrington but he was saved by the intervention of Thrasher who showed film that demonstrated that Komlos was lying. Komlos was arrested and the Headbangers were reformed.It looks like June to September  was the window Chaz existed in... also what the fuck is up with that storyline Attidue Era??? Edit Just realized Chaz was in WM ... not No Mercy.... apparently Im figuring out WM .  Alternatively Stevie Richards is clearly in RTC garb and they debuted in June .  ,N64WrestlingGames,cznxc1l,2,t5_3a9ik

7827460,0,t3_4meovp,I was playing WCWNWO Revenge the other day and read through the Credits. I noticed that the guy who did the music was simply credited as Ben with no last name. In the special thanks section I spotted Tommy Tallarico of Video Games Live fame. I wonder what relationship Ben had with TT. What was Tommys involvement at all? ,N64WrestlingGames,d3vvfx5,2,t5_3a9ik

9016851,0,t3_53rfrf,gt One of his submissions starts off as a WallsofJerichoesque submission I forget the technical term but quickly morphs into what I could barely describe as an animation clusterfuck.You mean the Boston Crab that glitches into a Half Crab where Wrath is backwards and looks like hes anally raping the opponent.gt I still havent found a more suitable outfit for him than Brian Adams outfits.Well they were a tag team for awhile but I find black and white versions of Mortis and Bret Hart attires dont look too bad. His attire in WCW vs. nWo World Tour was pretty close to Brets the one hes wearing in this image plus he was in a stable with Mortis.,N64WrestlingGames,d7voo9z,5,t5_3a9ik
