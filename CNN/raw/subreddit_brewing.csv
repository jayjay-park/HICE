647852,0,t3_1y7a0w,Been brewing  gallon batches for over a year with a couple gallons also using dme liquid extract and allgrain. Ive found it best to stay away from dme due to very annoying boil overs. If you can hook up with liquid extract for your brew that would be best. After brewing over a year I still stay away from getting to bold due to a couple brews not coming out so awesome.,brewing,cgdwt2k,1,t5_2qn47

7288633,0,t3_4f7jep,glb in  gallons Im not quite sure though. You can use either flaked or desiccated. The oven method you described works well. Coconut is a bit of a gentle flavour so the fermentation process can drive it away so put it in four or five days after fermentation has started and then taste it at bottling. If it doesnt taste enough coconut at bottling you can add a bit of coconut liqueor until it tastes enough like coconut. Do remember that the liquor most likely has a lot of sugar in it so either let it ferment out or take away the amount of sugar in the liquor you add from the carbonation sugar.,brewing,d26o2ux,3,t5_2qn47

8176402,0,t1_d4zhn5z,Thanks for the feedback. Whatever it is I should be able to keep it Sterile and free from Oxygen. If the coupler leaks that badly that is another huge issue. I can rig up a Jockey box fairly easily. I guess if I just refrigerate it all goes away.  gallons though filling a fridge.... Feels like madness. I guess its not a huge jump when Someone is trying to brew who doesnt really drink alcohol or soda.  Its also not very cool to show people when its stuck in a fridge. The only things I drink anymore really are sugar free.I guess I can make a Green Ginger tea and put it on the counter and see how long it lasts.  ,brewing,d4zlm52,1,t5_2qn47
8180036,0,t1_d4zlm52,I can tell you from experience that homemade ginger beer gets moldy even in a refrigerator in less than  months. Absence of oxygen doesnt seem to stop that as I filled with a counterpressure filter.,brewing,d501y67,2,t5_2qn47
8944924,0,t3_52szer,Does it taste or smell off? Did you measure the gravity when you samples it? Whatever that is on top doesnt look good from the picture. Infection flavors can run the gamut from nail polish remover to barnyard to plasticband aid.,brewing,d7n1qi7,1,t5_2qn47
8976924,0,t3_538jon,Northern Brewer Midwest are good as are others. Get on their mailing lists for the sales  thats when youll make out the best. Recently ordered  IPA kits from NB when on sale for  each. Also if youre doing ingredients check out local suppliers. Shipping on mail order can kill any savings on price you might find via mail order.,brewing,d7qw1wk,2,t5_2qn47
