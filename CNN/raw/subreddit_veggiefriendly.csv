3855766,0,t1_cqvr30p,Well you hung in there never gave up and proved you were the real person you claimed to be so well done! In all honesty you won the match. In exchange Ill squeal on myself Im a bad vegan. I struggle with keeping on the path at times and occasionally I lose. I got into vegetarianism on a whim fell off the wagon after five years got scared straight by some popular documentaries and a little research. Still swore I would never go vegan because I couldnt give up cheese. Of all the selfish stupid things that was it. But the old community was much more positive back then. Without shaming or nagging they slowly brought me over. My takeaway was that animal rights while extremely important is not everyones trigger. Drastic changes in lifestyle and diets are hard for some people to make. Sometimes the way to the ultimate goal is through inspiration and lifestyle education. I guess I was hoping to carry on that tradition here and I got a little protectivedefensive.  I wasnt kidding about staining my soul though. Im not a good person but I try hard to be so when the reality of what did sinks in it doesnt feels good. Anyhooooo this is getting sappy blame the wine. I swear Im not an alcoholic its just been a rough week...,veggiefriendly,cqvsk3i,5,t5_36yjv
