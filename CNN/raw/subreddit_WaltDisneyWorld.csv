114399,0,t3_1urhen,I just got back and have to say NAY.  We had nothing but trouble with ours.  Apparently our issues were the sort that are kind of rare but not wholly unique  in other words theyve been known to happen but no one knows how to fix it.In a nutshell nothing talked to anything.  So at various points my magic band would let me access the dining plan but not FastPass or park tickets park tickets but not fast pass or point of sale or nothing at all.  I had to reset my pin a good dozen times.  At one point they just gave up rebuilt my reservation and gave me cards for both the park and for the rooms.  A lot of hours were spent each day trying to sort this out and I managed by giving my  yearold purchasing authority on her magic band.  Not ideal but it sort of worked.TLDR Still some big kinks no individual is equipped to manage all the pieces due to complexity,WaltDisneyWorld,cerggmr,1,t5_2te6p

147925,0,t3_1vrg2p,Theres a lot I dont lime about FastPass but I think what bugs me the most is the fact that only onsite guests can book in advance. Fastpasses were equalizers that anyone could utilize to make their vacation a bit more magical and now families are paying to get ahead. I have big issues with that. If people want to book in advance  why cant they? We are booking our meals  days out maybe wed like to have those rides planned out as well. Some people are need to plan I had all sorts of anxiety taking my fiance to Disney for his trip even though Ive been there on at least  vacations  and having a plan of attack helped me relax and enjoy the trip more.,WaltDisneyWorld,ceva2r0,1,t5_2te6p

227822,0,t1_cf4byb5,I dont think using FP between parks in the same day is a no brainer. If this were the case everyone would go for the E ticket attractions in each park and they would run out of time slots even earlier. What are the chances youd get a paper fastpass for Toy Story Mania amp Soarin in the same day? Nearly impossible given they sell out of them so early in the day. If they let you pick between parks in the same day it would be even harder for people to get fastpasses for those rides. ,WaltDisneyWorld,cf4d0y4,7,t5_2te6p

Captain EO I believe was never meant to be permanent just cashing in on Jacksons death.  And the great movie ride while a staple does need to be updated.  Though I can understand if they opt to shut it down in favor of more Star Wars.  If they do that though Id rather they tear down from the Great Movie ride to Star Tours.  not Star Tours itself just everything in between the two.  I fear theyll tear down the Muppets instead though thatd be kind of sad.,WaltDisneyWorld,chnq8v8,1,t5_2te6p

A trip almost always had at least  major breakdown but in my more recent trips it has been far more infrequent to have a ride breakdown.I assume Disney put in updated technology to prevent the frequent breakdowns that used to occur.I do recall Test Track soft opening being in an hour long line and having to wait  hours because the ride kept breaking down.  We left Epcot  hours after it closed.  Wedway people mover got stuck multiple times.  Splash mountain we got stuck for over  minutes in a nonmusic area.  Pirates we would get  minute backlogs often.  Getting stuck in Buzz for  minutes and easily getting .  On the most recent trip voyage of the Little Mermaid got stuck for  minutes before I boarded.

1306560,0,t1_cigc45f,Just wanted to give you a heads up regarding the pins. My wife and I just went to disney for our honeymoon back in April and we were underwhelmed by the honeymoon treatment so to speak. What I mean by this is anniversary pins were bright red and said happy anniversary happy birthday pins bright yellow and said happy birthday... Honeymoon pins were a not so vibrant purple and said happily ever after. You would be surprised how many cast members completely did not notice our pins or when they did kind of ignored them. We went with another couple of were on their anniversary and more times than I can count our cast members looked at them congratulated them with a warm smile then looked at us and said nothing. The first time we were congratulated was after the other couple pointed out we were on our honeymoon too. It then became a running joke that our friends were ruining our honeymoon by stealing all our thunder as the first couple of days went just like that. Day two or three we even had a cast member ask us what our button meant and we had to explain to her that it was because we are on our honeymoon and she then congratulated us. Eventually my wife wrote bride and groom rather largely in black marker on the bottom of our pins and that alleviated some of this. I dont mean to sound like I have sour grapes of my Disney experience my wife and I did have a wonderful time. It just was a little underwhelming considering that universal really went all out with pampering us for our honeymoon. Moral of the story bride and groom Tshirts or upgrading your buttons like we did is probably a good idea. BTW the kona cafe was the best breakfast at disney... UNTILL we had Boma breakfast.

1471447,0,t1_cj0pkc0,I am a fullon Disneyphile and I had not actually heard of The Unofficial Guide until my friend bought the  edition paperback for me for Christmas. Even with my knowledge of the parks and all my vacations there I grew up in Florida and currently go at least once a year from Texas as I said earlier I apologize for repeating myself so Ive been more times than I count this book is AMAZING.They review EVERY ride EVERY restaurant I mean literally every single one from the smallest counter service to the most opulent dining experience that requires a coat amp tie EVERY hotel both on and off property and EVERY experience there is to be had at WDW. They also include ways to maximize your budget get all the rides in when to go when to book etc. They also provide guest feedback from the park as well as users of The Unofficial Guide itself they also dont limit themselves to positive feedback either.Now as to whether or not the Kindle edition is worth it I dont know. Im thinking that if you would rather have it handy whenever versus lugging an  page book around then sure. However if youre like me and prefer the feel of a book no matter how large as well as being able to pass it around to others like your husband for their perusal then maybe not. I believe Im going to try the Kindle edition myself this year just so I can see which I prefer going forward.All that being said I think its worth it to have the book AND the website membership. You can make touring plans on the fly get up to date info sometimes ridepark info can change after the book is published and view it all at a glance. It also lets you get the benefits of their app and then youll have all the resources all the time.I apologize for the wall of text but I really do believe in The Unofficial Guide!TLDRYes.,WaltDisneyWorld,cj0pz12,3,t5_2te6p

1661025,0,t3_2dd343,Not necessarily.I do disagree with previous posters who said you should be able to find a table at any sitdown restaurants. October is Food amp Wine Festival and also the start of Free Dining  so you will find less availability in the parks in my opinion.The only TS restaurant Ive been to is Liberty Tree Tavern. I wanted a bit of a change for my next trip though so I plan to try a LOT of TS restaurants next time. I do recommend ADRs for anything highly sought after or any that you particularly want to check out better safe than sorry! Ive read that you can find better availability with the HTF restaurants about  days before a trip. I think its a good rule of thumb to check MDE around  days before the first day of your trip when onsite guests are choosing FP. ADRs may have to be switched around due to these  especially if they can only find a PM FP for Anna and Elsa again at  when packages need to paid in full and lastly about  days before your trip. Again this is only if you want to find an ADR for a restaurant thats hard to get like Be Our Guest Chef Mickeys etc. So youre really not too late to find one!,WaltDisneyWorld,cjoj9be,3,t5_2te6p

At a hotel off site near seaworld a employee made my sons bed in his crib.  Totally unexpected and above normal duties.  It was perfect.  his toys perched next to his pillow.  Almost felt bad pulling the blankets back and putting our son in it.  We also tip when we have created more of a normal mess.  My son got sick on one of our trips at POP.

2743899,0,t1_cnfmbyw,Yeah it wasnt cheap I dont regret going but if I ever go back its gonna be a cheaper resort for sure. That being said I didnt regret a day being there and it was worth every penny for me having the monorail going right through your resort is both a cool novelty and convenience getting to the parks. Having a walk way from MK right to your resort means you can stay as late there as you want and not think twice about it for extra magic hours. What it lacks in theme it makes up for in convenience.,WaltDisneyWorld,cnfyx6c,2,t5_2te6p

2895670,0,t3_2tad3s,Ive only been to BOG for lunch. My experience is you find out when they open for lunch and show up  hour before that and youll get in after a notterrible wait. But I go at a time of year thats less crowded than usual so YMMV. I dont know about the crowdedness or lack thereof at the time youre going. The lunch food at BOG is nice mostly not exciting. I had a very nice beef dish and a very nice piece of pastry my dad had a sandwich which was fairly basic but he said it was very well prepared and it looked nice and fresh. Most of the lunch menu is sandwiches. What most people including those who have been there and didnt stop to think about it dont understand about BOG is that its actually a glorified fast food restaurant just a very very nice one. The atmosphere is lovely and worth a visit just to see it and a waiter brings your food to your table but you order and pay when you walk in and the place is crammed with tables so its not a really upscale experience except for the atmosphere... but its still charming and a good experience particularly for lunch especially if there are children with you.The service is super fast so once youre in your food arrives at your table moments after you sit down. You can have a nice meal in a beautiful environment and be back out in the park again fairly quickly. I havent been to le cellier. I noticed someone else suggested Chefs du France which Ive been to several times and love. I suggest if youre looking for a fun lunch BOG is great if youre looking for a meal thats special one of the table service restaurants like Chefs du France and maybe le cellier is a better choice.,WaltDisneyWorld,cnx8pnh,1,t5_2te6p

3000289,0,t1_co8ye3p,To be perfectly honest I think a lot of it depends on your personality or rather how your family perceives your personality. If youre more schedule oriented your best bet might be a reveal after an early dinner DD perfect time btw to get there for probably little waiting. If on the other hand youre less schedule oriented and a decent actor then it might be possible to eat hang around DD for a while and discover its too late to make it to Clearwater that night and try to find a room at Disney. But its whatever works for you.You also might be able to ship all of the stuff to the resort with a request that they put the boxes gift wrapped? in your room before your arrival. I dont know if Disney would do this but it certainly seems like something that would make the magic real you know? That way you could keep the Clearwater ruse going until the last possible second.Just some thoughts. ,WaltDisneyWorld,co8z7tb,5,t5_2te6p

On our last trip we happened to be in MK for a reservation and the park was pretty slow for some reason so we hung around for the EMH and it was great. Almost no lines and we managed to get on  or  rides in just a couple of hours.From my experience the park is extra busy until closing then dies out for EMH once folks start realizing they cant get on any rides without scanning their bands.,WaltDisneyWorld,cohgrl2,1,t5_2te6p
3083853,0,t3_2vfch0,This is the worst ride in the whole resort.  People die on it.,WaltDisneyWorld,cohn1q1,1,t5_2te6p
3086534,0,t3_2vi91d,So the biggest difference is the size of Disney World.  Once you enter Disney property there is nothing but Disney property for as far as the eye can see.  Theres no Harbor Blvd no Mickey amp Friends Parking Structure no outside world visible from the top of the mountains.  This makes for a much more immersive vacation experience.  If you are staying at a Disney resort then from hotel staff to the bus drivers they are all Disney Cast Members and are working on making your experiences magical.The downside to the size of the resort is how difficult is is to get around.  You cant just walk across the esplanade to park hop.  You are looking at a  minute monorail boat or bus ride.  Same goes for getting to and from your hotel and for getting to Downtown Disney.  This means a lot more thought has to be given to how you are going to get around and what time you have to leave at.  For example if you are staying at and Port Orleans and you want to get the Animal Kingdom Lodge for the character breakfast youll have to take a bus to one of the theme parks or DTD and then transfer to a bus to the Animal Kingdom Lodge.  There are no buses between the resorts themselves.  Between the time on the bus and time waiting for buses you could be looking at a  minute trip or longer.  Or you just pay for a taxi.As far as the parks go there is a decent amount of overlap between attractions but they are often different enough that you should still ride the ones you love at the DLR.  Obviously Magic Kingdom is very similar in layout to Disneyland.  Main Street will be bizarro Main Street.  It will be familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.  Same goes for the Railroad.  Adventureland will be pretty similar but lacks Indiana Jones the ride system is identical to Animal Kingdoms Dinosaur but the theming is better with Indy.  PotC is part of Adventureland and is a shell of the DL version.  There is no New Orleans Square.  Instead the Haunted Mansion is in Liberty Square and it is probably even better than the original.  Frontierland at MK combines DLs Frontierland and Critter Country.  MKs Big Thunder is not as good as the renovated one at DL but Splash Mountain is better.  MK still has Country Bear Jamboree.  Disneylands Fantasyland is better than MKs since most of MKs dark ride have been replaced with the Princess meet and greet and Mickeys Philharmagic which is still an entertaining show worth seeing.  That being said MKs New Fantasyland is unlike anything at DL and is an upgrade from Toontown.  The big highlight is Seven Dwarfs Mine Train.  Youll also find a unique Belle character meet n greet Adventure of the Little Mermaid same ride as DCA but with a better exterior a kiddie coaster and a supersized Dumbo that lacks the charm of the original but has a great preshow play area.  Tomorrowland is much better themed than DLs and has more of the original rides such as the Carousel of Progress and Tomorrowland Transit Authority but it is lacking Star Tours youll have to go to Hollywood Studios for that.The obvious counterpart of DCA is Hollywood Studios.  Buena Vista street does a better job at capturing the rosetinted glasses essence of Hollywood than Hollywood Studios does.  Both have Tower of Terror with HSs version being better and Toy Story Midway Mania both rides are similar but HSs has better queue theming.  Hollywood Studios has a lot more shows than DCA  Indiana Jones Little Mermaid Lights Motor Action.  HS also has Rock N Roller Coaster which might be the most thrilling coaster in the Disneys US portfolio.  It has the linear acceleration of California Screamin with the indoor thrills of Space Mountain.The other highlights of DCA are spread out among the other parks at WDW.  Youll find an exact copy of Soarin in Epcot although youll be wondering why you are flying over California and not Florida and the same ride system as Radiator Springs Racers in Epcots TestTrack although RSR is a much better ride.  Grizzly River Rapids is similar to Animal Kingdoms Kali River Rapids I personally prefer GRR.Theres nothing like Epcot or AK at DLR.  They are completely unique.  Be sure to explore both Futureworld and the World Showcase at Epcot and see lots of animals at Animal Kingdom.  Also Expedition Everest is a great coaster and a improved version of the classic Matterhorn.In terms of restaurants I would put Napa Rose and Carthay Cirlce up against WDWs California Grille and Victoria amp Alberts for fine dining but one place WDW has no competition is themed dining.  From Be Our Guest in the Magic Kingdom to all the World Showcase restaurants to the campy s Prime Time Diner and SciFi Drive In at Hollywood Studios there is no shortage of unique dining experiences at WDW.  Is the food as good as what you might find at the similarly priced Catal or Jazz Kitchen in DTD?  Probably not.  But the food is still quite good and the experience is not to be missed.Despite all there is to do at WDW the number of visitors necessitates much more planning than a weekend trip to DL.  Disney has appeased a vacation planning arms race by offering onproperty resort guests early access to dining and FastPass reservation.  For the most indemand restaurant and character meals you have to call or get online right when your  day window opens.  Remember that dayof Plaza Inn character breakfast reservation you made?  Yeah not happening at WDW.Same goes for FastPasses.  Unlike DLs paper FastPasses WDWs FastPass is now electronic and linked to your park ticket through a MagicBand this serves as your hotel room key park ticket FastPass and resort charge card.  You can make up to three ride reservations in a single park up to  days in advance.  By and large FP reservations are not in as high demand as dining reservations but youll still want to reserve as soon as you can to get the best times generally earlier in the morning as after youve used your third FP reservation you can start picking up additional ones at inpark kiosks.  The exceptions are the wildly popular Seven Dwarf Mine Train Anna amp Elsa Meet n Greet and Toy Story Midway Mania which are best reserved right at the  day window.All this means you have to put a lot more thought into planing a WDW trip.  Can you eschew planning and just wing it?  Sure but youll be waiting in longer lines and wont get tables at the most popular restaurants.  It really is best to decide on which parks you want to visit on which days and plan your restaurants and FP reservations accordingly.,WaltDisneyWorld,cohx1pu,29,t5_2te6p

3202852,0,t1_cotpt6a,Absolutely disagree here with the first two points. Its neither necessary nor affordable. Unfortunately it was expected.The bump isnt enough to price anyone out   more per ticket isnt going to keep anyone who wouldve gone last year out this year  so if the argument is that they have to do this to keep crowd levels manageable that doesnt work.Affordable I guess depends on how youre looking at it but I think everyone in this sub knows how financially strenuous a Disney vacation can be.Whats really responsible for the tradition of bumping ticket prices every year is the way we value and incentivize corporations. Since we calculate performance based on revenue growth the annual ticket price bump is an easy way to make sure WDW has a record year every year.,WaltDisneyWorld,cotz45w,1,t5_2te6p

Toy Story Midway Mania uses XP to drive the screens you shoot at.  XP is also used in the Imagination Pavilion on the computers you send email from.This amuses me largely because Microsoft stopped supporting XP last year.

However they dont require an entire pavilion. For example I would put in D printing as an exhibit. When D printing becomes so ubiquitous then you remove it and add something else that is up coming and can be easily demonstrated.

In general paying for the view in a moderate resort isnt worth it.

If one of you are taking a cab why not all of you take a cab since its the same price and should get you there a bit faster than DME.  Youd just have to grab your bags from baggage claim which isnt really that big of a deal.  You could also talk with a CM at the DME desk and see if theyll allow for a switch in riders.Have you tried calling the reservation line to get him added?  Im a little confused as to why you cant get him on there.  Not only will you run into issues with him not being able to ride DME but he wont be able to take advantage of EMH or any other perks that are hotelcentric.,WaltDisneyWorld,crzf067,1,t5_2te6p

If youre wanting to do Disney for a moderate price you could probably get away with doing it for a couple of thousand total.If you guys havent been before and youre ok spending the money stay at one of the nice resorts on the monorail loop  Grand Floridian Contemporary or Polynesian. Itll make getting to Magic Kingdom and Epcot super easy and quick. I believe the Poly is getting a makeover right now so that might not be the best idea GF is just finishing up theirs which is supposed to be done by the end of September and I believe the Contemporary is already finished. There is a special right now to save  on deluxe resort rooms through Dec th which as syd mentioned the week between Christmas and New Years is the busiest time to be there. You can check out this crowd calendar to get an idea of when it starts getting busier.For a three day stay over the thst weekend would be  a night at the GF so just an idea. You can play with the dates and length of stay to see if you can find a better deal.You could save significant money by staying at a moderate level resort for instance the Port Orleans French Quarter is only  a night for those same dates. Supposedly thats the best moderate resort for transportation with a quick boat ride to Downtown Disney and the first stops on lots of bus routes. We found we spent a pretty good amount of time on transportation there so were staying at GF this time around but its not bad if youre wanting to save a lot of money. The food wasnt the best but the resort grounds and room were nice enough.A three day ticket is going to be about  more per person including the park hopper option. Id suggest it  weve done it both ways and it gives you more options on how to spend your time. For instance if you want to spend the day at Magic Kingdom and then go over to Epcot for dinner and the nighttime fireworks you can do that. Alternatively you could get a four day pass and just use up one day pass to go to another park  it can be cheaper sometimes if you want to play with the options.Youll see varying opinions on getting a meal plan but I dont think its worth it. The convenience factor is apparently the biggest draw but Im of the mindset that without it you buy cheaper meals when you want and splurge on nicer restaurants if you feel like it without having to worry about meal and snack credits. Expect to spend  a day for decent meals or a couple hundred more if you want to eatdrink somewhere nice for dinner. If youre going for a nice romantic dinner one night I highly recommend California Grill. Make sure to get reservations as soon as you can as it fills up. Its located in the Contemporary near Magic Kingdom and they have great observation decks to watch the nightly fireworks where they pipe in the music for the show as well. If you cant get a reservation that guarantees youll be there when the fireworks happen you can always eat earlier and then you are allowed to come back later that evening to watch the fireworks.Im not sure what kind of flight options are there coming out of Bozeman but before you book any resorts you should check your flight availability and prices as well. Find something that coordinates before you commit or you could pay significantly higher prices for airfare. If youre staying at a Disney resort make sure to look at the Magical Express for transportation from the airport to your resort and back. That way you dont have to rent a car that would most likely just sit parked the majority of the time anyway. They also transport your luggage straight from the airlines to the resort so you dont have to worry about that either.If youre only going to be there for a few days I wouldnt recommend spending an entire day to go to Universal. You can easily spend an entire day at Magic Kingdom Epcot and then split the third day between Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom.Also just a heads up you can start making dining reservations highly recommended for the nicer sit down restaurants six months prior to your arrival. When staying at a Disney resort  days out you can make your fast pass selections. Since youve already hit the six month before arrival mark go ahead and make dining reservations as soon as you can.Any other questions feel free to ask ,WaltDisneyWorld,ctlhabk,2,t5_2te6p

For any other resort they cant book it until  months out. If you use a broker they usually display the price difference between  months and  months.

5502273,0,t1_cwevzue,Well first Im glad you at least framed your complaint about the single rider line a new way.  Rather then complain that groups are using it which I have no issue with again if they want to ride alone they can just like anyone else you really are saying its just too long of a wait period for the attraction.  This is a valid complaint for several rides.You used my statements to support the argument of a class system.  I didnt mean to disagree with you that there is one.  I meant to say there is one that exists in all aspects of society and Disney as a profit making business is certainly no exception.  I dont mind that people that pay more get more.  Thats life.  We arent even talking about necessity here like healthcare.  This is discretionary spending.  Disney rewards me with a  day window vs  days because I pay more when I go.  Other people pay less and dont get that.  Other people pay more and get things I dont.  I was upgraded to a concierge floor room when I went on my honeymoon.  That was awesome.  Some people get that level of service and benefits every time.  Because they pay the money for it.  I guess I dont see Disney as some utopia where there arent have and have nots just like everywhere else.Maybe things will be better once some of the new areasattractions open.  The extra track and screen at TSMM and Soarin will make the line shorter.  The Frozen ride will definitely pull people away from the other ride lines in Epcot.  Future world really could use one more big ride though.  Avatars attractions will help shorten the lines for Everest and the Safari.  The HS renovations will include several new attractions that can eat up customers.Perhaps the real problem is just how long Disney waited to start those expansion projects while continuing to let the crowd sizes swell at even slower times of year.  More so then the new fastpass system.I really dont know.  I just know my experience with it was great the last few trips.  I know thats just one person though.Good talking with you about it either way.  This sub always makes me wish I was going back sooner.  If only I could investigate the wait times personally tomorrow!,WaltDisneyWorld,cweytfa,1,t5_2te6p

Get to the parks as early as possible take a napbreakswim in the afternoon and then stay late at night.  It gets busier as you get closer to Christmas so if youre there for the week before Christmas try to knock out the big rides at the beginning of your trip so that you can relax and enjoy the less popular rides as the parks get more crowded.Christmas morning is nuts Magic Kingdom filled to capacity on Christmas morning and the gates were shut.Instead of rushing to the parks on Christmas morning we had an awesome brunch at the Captains Grill at the Yacht Club Resort and then walked over to the World Showcase around noon.If you expect crowds and have a plan its very doable.,WaltDisneyWorld,cwzlwno,1,t5_2te6p

5722208,0,t3_3th78b,I totally recommend it if you have the money.  As for the pricing the reason it shows a range is the more expensive one is during the morning and the cheaper one is in the afternoon.  I do not recommend the afternoon at all as most of the animals will be asleep or hidden since it is hotter.  They are much more active during the morning tours.  I specifically asked the guides about this when I did it and this is what they said makes sense.  Scarletmuse summed it up pretty well already I just wanted to add the bit about pricing. Basically you go above a couple exhibits like the crocs and hippos and walk across some rope bridges then they put you in a private truck and merge in with the normal Kilimanjaro safari route but will pull off to the side and spend much more time in the savanna.  They then give you a light lunch overlooking the main savanna before continuing on towards the exit.  Pricey but worth it.,WaltDisneyWorld,cx6eacy,4,t5_2te6p

DD still has Star Tours has Wattos Grotto has and Star Traders in MK not sure about this one anymore didnt see as many lightsabers last week in MK as in the past.I think the base price is . now for the new sabers. There is also a deluxe model which adds Kylo Rens new piece dont know if that is at all locations though but I know Wattos Grotto does. The double bladed are double priced now essentially but you are getting two hilts that attach with a special piece in the middle so now both sides light up. You can also do a deluxe saber with Kylo Rens pieces on both ends which is something like ..In a lot of ways I feel the new hilts are a bit less customizable with less pieces in Wattos Grotto at least. But they fit together a lot better now which is a big plus.I find the Star Tours location to be the worst since it has more people and they really try to push you through the process a lot quicker.Word about the Kylo Ren piece though one of the exhaust vents pulled right out of mine and I cant get it back in.

6038458,0,t1_cyb4lx0,Yeah. I think the original renderings need to go and you need to put them somewhere the land can support it. I think the Asian hotel whose renderings do NOT hold up  years later in ANY way that resembles good taste! was supposed to be where GF was and Venetian was supposed to be on land that simply wasnt usable. Nearest available land from that era that was usable is now Shades of Green.Based on developable land I think any new resorts would be de facto Moderates. Not enough parkproximate land that can be developed. AKL is the last Deluxe developed and even within DVC its considered a nonpremium resort because it cant walk to a destination.

6072824,0,t3_3ypn9k, Magic Kingdom  Id like to see a Pirates Land. I know theyre doing it in Shanghai. On the West side of POTC they could expand to add a Pirates Land while also renovating and giving a massive reboot to the POTC attraction. I feel like POTC is oddly placed where it currently is. I dont feel its a perfect fit. POTC in DL fits a lot better within the New Orleans theme. Epcot  Town of Epcot. Hear me out. This would be Walts dream imagined combined with all the crap theyve placed in Innoventions over the years. My idea is that there be a small town or land in Epcot dedicated to the original idea of the Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow. The town will serve  purposes. First it will displace crazy technologies that will revolutionize the future such as the roads made out of solar panels. I dont know if youve seen that Kickstarter but its a crazy idea. Its too expensive to create in a real city but Disney could add it to their little experimental town. Second this town will have some attractions embedded within it. It wont just be a bunch of buildings with cool tech. Hollywood Studios  Chicago Themed Area.Using forced perspective Disney can really make it feel like youre walking through the city. The area would also feature an Incredibles Roller Coaster. The roller coaster will be the first virtual reality coaster. Everyone wears virtual reality masks and flies with the characters. The actual track of the coaster mixed with the virtual reality will give you the illusion that youre flying. The coaster would be mostly indoors but will be able to be viewed from some locations throughout the Chicago land because there will aboveground subway tracks that the ride tracks will be located on. If youre walking in the land it looks like a subway train is passing but meanwhile its the roller coaster. Animal Kingdom  I really dont know. Before they add another land Dino Land really needs to get bulldozed. That carnival area is very unDisney. What they should do is bulldoze the area and make a proper Dinosaur area. They could go full Jurassic Park with the animatronic technology nowadays. That would be awesome to actually feel like youre walking amongst the dinosaurs.... the cost would be very high though. This place in New Jersey just closed Disney could buy all of these Dinosaurs and placed them throughout Dino Land.,WaltDisneyWorld,cyfmuht,4,t5_2te6p
6078871,0,t3_3yrffy,If it makes any difference I had an annual pass for Universal when the Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened and visited a lot in that first year.  Wizarding World had a HUGE crowd and for the first few months.  There was a line just to get into the section not for a ride or store just to get into the area.  As crazy as it was the rest of the park wasnt that bad.  In fact in the first few months Wizarding World was open the rest of the park would be empty in the mornings since everyone would run there as soon as the park opened.  Obviously Universal and Disney are different but based on my experiences you should be okay.  Remember Harry Potter has a much larger fan base then Avatar.  I think the new Avatar movies will get people excited about it again but as a huge Potter fan I can say that we can be intense.  My one piece of advice would be to ignore Avatar.  If you are not into it dont try to push through the crowds.  Do what you want in the rest of Animal Kingdom.  True it might be nice to at least check it out but if you see hour long lines and you dont care that deeply about it just move on.  Just plan your FastPasses well and you should be fine.  Also I dont think the other parks will be affected unless it you go on opening day.  I can see the crowds at DAK be crazy that day it will probably hit capacity and Cast Members turning people away to go to other parks.,WaltDisneyWorld,cygf96q,1,t5_2te6p

6094084,0,t1_cyi2tue,It always comes down to if you think you will use it.  I would say if you are the family that only travels for a one week vacation once a year you are probably better off buying a package through the travel company.  The savings that DVC gives you in the info session is comparing it to staying in the deluxe hotels.   Now that we are staying in the deluxe hotels  times a year yes we are saving quite a bit.  Being in SC it could have added benefits for you as the DVC also has a Hilton Head property with a private beach.   One thing to remember is that you wont qualify for the free dining packages any longer but you can still add a meal plan onto your stay.  If the meal plan isnt for you DVC members are usually are offered  off at certain restaurants it changes periodically.  Also you will qualify for Tables of Wonderland too.  Tickets will also be an add on but again occasionally there are special offers and there is always an option of buying a discounted annual pass.  Dont forget that there is a resale market for points too.  That is a good way to buy into older resorts that are no longer being marketed to the general public.  Additionally the points will be at a discount.  One of the limitations of doing this is that you wont be able to use points on cruises but truthfully that isnt a good use of points.  This is a quick overview but I invite you to as more questions if you have anything else specific you are wondering about.  Also please join us at rdvcmember Its a great place to ask questions get a feel for what the DVC membership entails as well as a great place to get different perspectives.  EDIT I would also like to add even if we dont really want to go into the parks theres a lot to do without walking through one of the gates its nice to know we always have a really nice hotel stay already covered.  ,WaltDisneyWorld,cyic1t7,1,t5_2te6p

6396586,0,t3_439gsq,gtMy mom is retiringNot sure about your mom but a lot of older folks prefer to take things slow and keep things simple... hopping can be mentally and physically tiring to them. So if your mom is this way Id recommend sticking to one park per day.September is a really nice time to go but I recommend going a little later during food and wine festival if that interests you went with my mom last year and had a blast sampling dishesdrinks.

That said if youre meeting the same characters over and over I think they are less special. But I know that Ohana Hollywood amp Vine and Akershus have different characters. Lilo amp Stitch Playhouse Disney and the princesses But I think the others are all just the classic characters. So maybe just doing one of those?

6454508,0,t3_441eti,Stopping to switch lenses sounds like a lot of hassle  at Disney World. I would go for something with a low zoom range. I think the mm is probably fine but there are good lenses with a wide aperture that may be better for Disneymost things are in relatively close range and you dont need more than mm. But there are times you may want to zoom out. Im hardly an expert but if you want to go a little smaller in lens size with convenience as a factor that might be a good idea.I dont know if you follow Disney Tourist Blog but he has a lot of good posts about taking pics at Disney and has lots of lens suggestions for full frame and crop sensors.,WaltDisneyWorld,czmxsco,2,t5_2te6p

6534287,0,t1_czv01xl,I dont know if the introduction of fastpasses is completely responsible for the longer wait times although I dont think they help. If these figures are to be believed yearly attendance at MK was between  million and  million excluding special event years like the th  and th indicated in the year  anniversaries. According to this report approximately  million people attended MK in  the most recent figures.  Yearly attendance effectively doubled from the s to now. Theoretically if the only thing that changed is the number of guests that attended MK then that  minute wait time should translate to approximately a  minute wait time. According to touringplans crowd levels a  minute wait falls within levels  on a whole. If you ignore the data for Peter Pans Flight that  minute wait time covers levels  and for some rides covers all the levels. I think what fastpass is really guilty of on the big rides is making those in the stand by line aware of their relative speed to the finish line. Before you really had no frame of reference about how fast the line was moving. You could tell it was moving or not moving but you really couldnt tell how fast they were loading and unloading the ride. When you can see the fastpass line you become aware of this information. Which in turn makes it feel that youre having to wait an extremely long time. ,WaltDisneyWorld,czv74f4,7,t5_2te6p

6853503,0,t3_49mh57,OOO! One I can answer! NurseDisney fanatic over here. I feel like this post is my calling. SNACKSSo basically youre going to want to try controlling his carb intake. Avoid the soft pretzels and sugary desserts specifically. If he wants a snack Disney offers fresh fruit cups and applesbananas as snacks these will be the best bet. Fruit still has sugarcarbs in it but it is significantly lower from other snack options. If you can find citrus fruits specifically like oranges these are all around the best. Almost all quick service stands have some fruit. MEALSWhen meals come around try to avoid friespotatoes and instead try to go for veggies for sides. The key is high protein low carb so grab a steak at Le Cellier with some fresh seasonal veggies. If he wants fries do sweet potato fries. House of Blues in Disney Springs Downtown Disney has awesome sweet potato fries. DESSERTSThere are sugar free desserts located throughout Disney but you might have to keep an eye out for them. I found this blog for sugar free sweets at Disney online so maybe you can check some of these places out. But most of all just have fun. Try not to overthink it. Try not to dwell on the food choices. Just make the best choices you can under the circumstances. Set a goal of only doing one bad meal a day. Or only one sugary dessert a day. And then the rest of the time try to watch it. As long as everything is done in moderation its okay. And make sure he has his insulinglucometer handy to check throughout the day because theres nothing worse than going hypoglycemia or hyperglycemic in the middle of fun. If you need medical help they have first aid stations located in at least one area of each park I know MKs first aid station is right off of main street on the left hand side kind of by Crystal Palace. Also STAY HYDRATED! Florida is hot and dehydration exacerbates diabetic symptoms. Edit spelling,WaltDisneyWorld,d0t5ih6,6,t5_2te6p

This was a timing issue for me as right when they switched pricing tiers well when my passes were up for renewal anyway many attractions were going down for good or for long term rehabbing. I had to do a very hard look at nostalgia vs whether or not it was worthwhile and I went quite frequently. I also identify with the complaints about a lack of personal touches that come with loyalty. Ive been a passholder since  was married there stayed at every resort multiple times regularly dined at the restaurants did inaugural cruises on the Dream and Fantasy and when I was at guest services trying to decide whether or not it was worth spending double what I previously paid for me and the kids to continue going the total and complete lack of empathy and recognition of loyalty caused me to turn around and walk away. Countless memories tens of thousands of dollars spent and Id finally hit a breaking point. I didnt renew. Might be foolish might be arrogant to think that MY loyalty was worth something but I had finally had enough. I will miss Disney but it is time to move on.

They love having operational certainty and that means advance reservations for all the things.  It also minimizes the amount of vacation time you spend waiting in lines.Do you need an ADR for every meal slot?  A detailed touring pal listing every single ride in order?  Nah.  But do you need to assign parks to days decide on your favorite restaurants and book fastpass and ADR reservations right when the window opens?  Absolutely.If you want a relaxing and spontaneous experience Disney is absolutely not the place  youd be better off in a world heritage city like Kyoto or a tropical island resort in the Caribbean or South Pacific.

Splash mountain I prefer WDW Version its slower paced and lets you absorb all the ride details. Space mountain biggest different in DLR its a  row cart with room for  people while WDW has room only for . The layout of DLR right now is for star wars in WDW its still the classic one. DLR version is smoother while WDW is shakier. Watch your neck. Seven dwarves mine train its a roller coaster mixed with a slight section of a dark ride. The carts sway from left to right giving you the feeling of falling down but its not that noticeable. Really really fun. Ride it in the morning for shorter lines or get a fastpass for it by night. Theres no real comparison to the matterhorn you could call expedition everest in AK the sequel to matterhorn but I havent rode it. WDW has no Indiana Jones ride only a stunt show in HSDO NOT miss Rock n Roller coaster in HS you could call it a shorter and darker California screamin but really theres no comparison on both. Screamin is linger and faster  RnR has a faster start and more loops. Also in Epcot you have to ride mission space its one of the best rides in WDW.

7348720,0,t3_4g04e7,Ive done a Wishes cruise that didnt involve dessert and it was pretty great.  Its definitely one of those things that not everyone gets to experience and makes Wishes even more magical feeling as you sit out on the water and watch it over the castle.  Id say if its one of those things you want to do do it.  I dont think you would regret spending however much it is for a ticket.  Also if you get a good cruise captain they can make it even better.  The ones that have been around for a while are FULL of WDW knowledge especially facts surrounding Bay Lake and the Seven Seas Lagoon.  ,WaltDisneyWorld,d2dhz8a,1,t5_2te6p

We could move faster with us in strollers versus us walking and we lasted in the parks longer without having to go back to the hotel to rest because we werent worn out by walking.

7379946,0,t3_4gf72y,I had the same question today! I talked to a cast member over Disney chat. Ive never used Memory Maker before but heres what I understoodYou only get to link it to  person but everyone who is listed as your friends amp family can get pictures on your Memory Maker. I asked her specifically if I take my daughter to meet Doc McStuffins and my husband takes my son to meet Star Wars characters we will be able to get pictures of both kids even though its in my name? And the cast member said yes. Everyone who is in my family amp friends list on my trip will get pictures taken on my Memory Maker.My motherinlaw and fatherinlaw are in a different room on a separate reservation. I sent a friend request to my motherinlaw and she approved me so she showed up on friends amp family. My fatherinlaw doesnt have a Disney account and his name is managed by my motherinlaw. I sent her a friend request for him too so hes now on my friends amp family list as well. I guess Im trying to say that I dont think youll have a problem as long as you work to link everyone to your account!,WaltDisneyWorld,d2h1s30,1,t5_2te6p

7408470,0,t3_4gs7ny,I would probably do  in MK and then  in all the other parks because youre going at a veeeeery busy time. I feel like if you do that youll be able to do all the shows rides and meet and greets you want. Theres still not a set date for when Frozen will be open just June  but I imagine that section SHOULD be open by then. I personally love Hollywood Studios and could easily spend two days there but if you feel like theres not enough for you all to do then maybe do a full day there and then a half day? And hop to another park or go to the resort to relax in the pool?Be aware that you cant use Express Pass for the Harry Potter rides. Hulk and King Kong might be open by then so you should find out ahead of time if you can use the pass for those just to be prepared.Also I am extremely jealous of your two weeks there!

7546764,0,t3_4ipp7e,Ive had similar experiences. I understand that walking around the parks is hard for some people and so even people who normally walk will use scooters. My fatherinlaw is a very big man in terms of both height and weight. Ive never seen him use a scooter before but weve talked about him possibly renting one at Disney. So I get that they help people. That said people who arent immobile need to be the most considerate when it comes to their scooters. At Disneyland people with scooters parked along the front of the parade route about  hours before the parade and just camped out there. They literally blocked the views for hundreds of people. To them Im sure it was so nice to be able to just sit down and relax for a while and wait for the parade. They didnt think about how they were ruining the experience for everyone else. Heres the picture of our view of the parade They literally created a wall obstructing the views for everyone else!I wish they could make rules about where scooters could be parked. The problem is you cant punish people who are actually disabled. I guess I just wish people were more considerate with their scooters instead of sometimes being selfish with them.,WaltDisneyWorld,d3013ti,1,t5_2te6p

Ive never done this particular dessert party but we did one similar that was offered in  during Star Wars Weekends and Id say its well worth it if for no other reason than convenience. You dont have to worry about getting some place early to stake out a good spot. The area for the dessert party is prime viewing and spacious so youre free to move around without being jammed into a particular area with everyone else. Plus the desserts and drinks are a nice plus. To me Id gladly pay  to be able to show up whenever Im ready and know Ill have a prime viewing spot space to move around and have snacks and drinks provided.

7672121,0,t3_4kd08f,I almost came on here the other day to warn people about BOG reservations but I thought maybe more would open up. November  is the day that free dining starts for November so some people with free dining started booking on May . All of those free dining people were working to get a lot of reservations! I got a BOG early breakfast for one day of my stay but when I went back to check more times I noticed there was really nothing else available. This was for more than  days out  days. It was literally all gone! I noticed the same thing for Hollywood amp Vine dinner on the day I was going which was also more than  days out as well as Akershus lunch  days. On May  evening I looked to see if maybe I could book a BOG dinner for November  which was  days out. The only thing available was for pm. I didnt take it because the terms amp conditions said that the characters wouldnt be available at that time. The reservations that didnt fill up last I checked was Ohana brunch and Liberty Tree lunch. There were still a lot of times available for those when I checked the following day.Anyway its going to be rough for people making ADRs over the next few weeks. Theres very low availability. They recommend making your difficult reservations for the last days of your trip so youre booking for   or  days out. Edit Also any day where there is the MVMCP they are only taking dinner reservations until about pm right now. That also limits BOG reservations. If you get tickets for MVMCP keep your eyes out for when they open up dinner reservations to ticket holders.,WaltDisneyWorld,d3e9xeu,2,t5_2te6p

It boggles my mind that more people dont do this and just think oh free transportation from the Orlando airport that must save me money right? Wrong. For some reason MCO just always comes in more expensive dont ask me why.Oh also there is a Cracker Barrel on the way to Disney from Tampa next to an RV park.

7859166,0,t3_4mx449,There were strong rumors a while back of DVC being added to World Showcase pavilions confirmed by Jim Hill with the feature of guests staying in these villas being able to access Epcot directly. If I recall correctly they wouldnt be massively huge resorts but they would be smallish buildings themed specifically to each country that you would enter via the back road. Coincidentally tied to this rumor is the extension of the World Showcase lagoon to the south to connect to Caribbean Beach Resort and possibly further to expand the current Friendship Boat transportation offering.Id like to say well see this someday as Disney runs out of space for more DVC buildings and needs to get creative but I think the reality is that these would probably cater to the uberrich like the the Poly Village Bungalows as Disney has been trying.

7859502,0,t1_d3ybe2g,Its not a form of pricing though. They can change the price of food items but not the value of a voucher. Thats why old Disney World tickets from the s are still valid. Imagine if an airline canceled a flight and gave you a voucher for a free flight. When you go to book they cant tell you Sorry this flight costs  vouchers. When you book they tell you how many of your dining credits the meals cost at a restaurant and you have to agree to it. They send you a confirmation telling you it will cost you that many vouchers. Thats why people said if Disney does change those restaurants to  credits each they will honor the people who originally booked it at  credit. Anyway if they add Anna amp Elsa to the Akershus lunch amp dinner it wouldnt surprise me if they bumped it to  credits for . If they do it people will have to accept those new conditions when making their reservations. I kind of hope they do add AampE to Akershus just like they have Cinderella at CRT even though she has a meet amp greet nearby.

A  year old is a tiny person and the prime size for an alligator to attack and it occurred in the time of day when gators are most active.However Ill be the first to admit that I had no idea how prevalent alligators were in the Central Florida area until this incident. Its something that isnt really mentioned at Disney World and you assume gators are limited to marshy swamp regions. I think its something Disney should emphasize near their bodies of water especially with so many small children around the park. If there is one positive and I hate using the term positive here its that this will bring awareness to the fact that yes alligators are something to keep an eye out for in all areas of Florida including Disney World.

We apartment shopped forever and in it was just slightly higher rent than the rundown gross apartments but its so nice. I think the only thing keeping the price down is that they have a big shortage of parking and have to be really strict about towing cars without stickers. Theres visitor parking but its really limited. If you have people over you have to be pretty strategic about getting them a visitor space. Or letting them park at the Alexandria View Apartments just down the road who have no stickerparking issue and picking them up but you didnt hear that from me.But if you can get used to the parking situation its a fantastic place. I cant imagine how any nonDisney residential space would be closer to the parks. Its on the other side of the woods from Golden Oak. The fence around it is the WDW property line.

You can sometimes get Disney rooms discounted if youre flexible or quick on your feet but Ive always been able to get discounted at Universal as well.  That makes Universal significantly less expensive in my mind.  Using the annual pass discount for example I was able to stay at Portofino Bay in May for around  a night.  Boardwalk which is one of the least expensive Disney Deluxe was over .

8191428,0,t1_d4imxar,gtLet the fantasy and escapism live in the Magic Kingdom.But it hasnt been exclusive to that one park ever.You say that Hollywood Studios shows us how the magic is made and done in the movies but for how long has that actually been true? Star Tours isnt a ride about making a Star Wars movie its escapism into the world of Star Wars. The Tower of Terror isnt a ride about the behind the scenes of the Twilight Zone it sends us into the Twilight Zone. Dinosaur has to using scifi technology to send us into the past and Everest has us looking for a fantastical yeti.Sure it opened as a studiopark hybrid but like Tomorrowland before it and like Epcot after it it also went through a thematic shift. Hell Epcot started that way as well. Are you really going to argue for the grounded realism of Figment and the Dreamfinder? Body Wars? One could argue that the purpose of World Showcase is to highlight the unique beauty and offerings of whatever nation youre in at the time. Arendelle isnt an actual location in Norway but its heavily inspired by the country and is definitely a unique enough setting that can be celebrated singalong ride. In short you cant and shouldnt keep fantasy and escapism contained to the Magic Kingdom because it never was to begin with. ,WaltDisneyWorld,d51hah9,1,t5_2te6p

Also keeps a FP option open for anything you want. But that will require some good timing admittedly.In cases where crowds are terrible Id also say I follow the EasyWDW strategy Lines are just going to get worse later so if you have to wait in a line wait earlier and deal with it then so you dont have to later. So if youre really worried about Jungle CruiseHaunted Mansion maybe swing that way first then spend wait time in lower wait attractions later ex. the Carousel the Riverboat Barnstormer etc.I think both of the other attractions you should be fine getting on at most any time of the day without major fuss so...theres that too.,WaltDisneyWorld,d5f524y,3,t5_2te6p

8327771,1,t1_d5i2uab,I completely disagree with this.I really dont like when people use the logic of you can save it by getting rid of it. Thats not helpful.Your statement implies that somehow having an experience that requires high technology is inherently a bad thing. This has some merit if you make the claim that trying to stay ahead of the technology curve in DQ is a fools folly however many agree that the advent of Virtual Reality today real Virtual Reality not the stuff we find in Disney Quest today is the final frontier of media requiring no more tech chasing.You claim that Disney Springs doesnt cater to the younger crowd anymore and quite a few people have upvoted this sentiment and I can understand that as when I first think of Disney Springs it indeed has a very adult vibe to it right now. That said when you think further than a kneejerk agreement you realize this simply isnt the case. Disney Springs has cirque du soleil Disney Quest a Lego store that allows kids to play with Lego right outside the store and even host build events you have Ice cream and treat shops a bunch of resturants with clearly kid inspiring thematics going on including Dinosaurs and Volcanos Bowling Alleys and Movie Theaters street paintings and countless other things that entertain kids as well as adults that makes me say.. actually no.. Disney Springs is as much catering to kids today as ever.I can sense some bitterness and nostalgia for the old Downtown Disney and I feel for you in that regard. However beyond DQ having outdated technology it is my personal opinion that it doesnt stick out and instead fits right in it just needs an update and the latest VR tech is an open opportunity to take it to the next level and beyond.,WaltDisneyWorld,d5iiym4,5,t5_2te6p

Hopper does let you go to a nd park if theres an event like MNSSHP on a day youre at MK.  Hopper means you can have a bit more flexibility with dining and such. Not a big deal to schedule an ADR at the Magic Kingdom for the evening and spend the day at AK for example. Can make a lot of inpark special events like tours easier. Youll have fun either way. Were looking at skipping it this year because we do want to spend a day exploring some areas like Epcot and AK we rushed through last time.

Not to mention the kiosks at airports and other heavily trafficked locations.  Youre also overlooking the fact that its as much a charger as it is a service.

Had I not bought the mah battery I have now I would have almost certainly bought a Fuelrod on impulse and since Im in the parks constantly for work I CERTAINLY wouldve gotten my  worth of charging out of it within a week.

9388842,0,t3_596bue,My wife and I spent our honeymoon at Disneys Boardwalk resort and it was wonderful.  FastPass is very useful and not to be vague but any ride where it is available will make it worth it. I usually get the FastPast for a ride like Space Mountain and then wait in line for another ride while I wait for my SM time. I repeat this all day FP a ride then wait for another. If I had to pick one attraction that I feel is perfect for FP its Buzz Lightyears Space Ranger Spin. Must see attractions? Thats difficult to say since everyones preferences are different. But since youre asking my personal mustdos are Spaceship Earth The Haunted Mansion Mission Space The Seas w Nemo and Friends The Carousel of Progress am I the only one who loves this one??  PotC Kilimanjaro Safari and Phantasmic. I enjoy all the attractions and rides but these are the nonnegotiable mustdos for me and Im probably leaving a few off the list that Ill remember after I post this! A major piece of advice I have to give regarding dining is to make your reservations as soon as they are available. I think the earliest is  months in advance but I could be wrong. Its so easy to miss a spot if you wait. My wife and I spent virtually every night doing a romantic dinner. Our favorite was at Narcoossees on the Seven Seas Lagoon. I requested a coveted window table and timed our reservation so we could see the fireworks show. They dim the lights inside the dining room and the soundtrack for the fireworks comes through the restaurant speakers. This may sound cliched for a Disney experience but it was one of the most magical things we experienced.  We ate at a lot of places but the other favorite of ours was at The Coral Reef Restaurant at the Living Seas. One entire wall probably  ft high and several feet wide is an aquarium with over  sea creatures! The restaurant is built like an amphitheater so rows of tables are on large steplike levels so everyone has a great view.  Youve mentioned this but Ill add that it is worth the attention and often perks to spend the money on the Mickey groom and Minnie bride hats. Castmembers gave us passes to the front of extremely long lines and other fun things just for wearing them. My wife and I celebrated our th anniversary recently and we keep saying well do another honeymoon to Disneyworld..and will definitely bring the hats!I hope you have a wonderful time its almost impossible not to! edit Ill mention that staying at the Boardwalk is not only more affordable than many other resorts but also has a walkway to a back entry gate for Epcot Its in the corner over by France and felt like a private entrance!,WaltDisneyWorld,d963ol3,4,t5_2te6p

When we get it at home its bottled from a natural spring in Canada and thats what we assumed it was all from there.  When we ordered it and had it delivered down in Florida it was bottled from a secured well in Lee Fl.  It tasted like the water fountains in the parks which is exactly what we wanted to avoid.         Luckily we also had some drink packets we could add to it but we ended up with much better tasting water from the drink fountains at the resort and some of the self serve QS restaurants.         We also had these  Which came in pretty handy.  You can open them up and fill them with icewater from the drink machinesfree cups of ice water from QS.

9783797,0,t1_daizmcb,gtI dont see the next generation getting excited about planning their trips.I might have agreed with this a few years ago but honestly today I couldnt think it could be more wrong.Ive taken friends over the last few years who have never been to any of the parks before and watched them turn into complete Disney fanatics. These are people with absolutely zero sense of nostalgia for these parks that theyve never before been to who end up going as often as I do if not more.Sure its anecdotal but I just dont think nostalgia is the primary driver for a lot of guests. Its the escapism which IMO hasnt been matched yet elsewhere.Then again I also dont agree that a Disney trip is work. It can be if you decide to treat it that way but its as easy as it has ever been to wing a trip having done it twice this year already.Lastly I just think people here tend to overestimate the size and power of the niche superfans. Were talking about resorts that see guests in the tens of millions annually. We are not that large. If the parks do well financially its because theyre resonating with the general public not just the hardcore fans. If anything its the hardcore fans that seem the most resistant to change and new things in these parks. Just take one look at the reception of the news of the Tower of Terror Maelstrom and even the hints of Future World changing. Its the kind of outlook that has me sooner deciding to try a rideshow myself than take the review of the hardcore fans since they tend to be hypercritical. ,WaltDisneyWorld,daj2eck,7,t5_2te6p

9871447,0,t3_5gq6nz,I know the talk is that Disney has cameras and facial recognition and security is everywhere. But I think a lot of that is hyped by Disney to prevent people from acting out. We have all read and seen videos of people in places they shouldnt be. I have seen many things I thought security would stop and never showed up. That is a lot of people and places to watch and I dont think they can do it all. They just try and pretend like they do. I am sure they do what they can and I wouldnt try if I was banned because I am sure they would prosecute to the full extent they can.  I was leaving Fantasmic a few years ago and followed some people down a path. Apparently it was not meant for guests. We ended up back stage and the people we followed went too fast. I didnt see where they went. We were trying to decide how to get back out and a CM came out and was surprised to see us. He showed us how to get back into the park.

9880743,0,t1_dauh7hq,While thats true there may be a few reasons this particular one is outdoors.  Remember the show areas of Disney buildings are often a small fraction of the total square footage  supposedly outdoor areas can be on top of an underground service floor or corridor and therefore technically part of a structure.  This is certainly true of most of the Magic Kingdom for example.Another potential explanation is that a fire alarm pull must be positioned within five feet of every emergency exit path by code.  The logic here is that there needs to be a way for someone escaping a burning structure to alert others who are still inside.  Typically these are mounted indoors but its possible the configuration of this particular gift shop didnt leave an obviously accessible location and forced an outdoor mounting instead.  It also appears this is mounted in a dead end corridor which could have something to do with it as well.In any case Disney has been a leader in fire safety engineering.  The RCID the mainly Disneycontrolled governmental entity with jursidiction over WDW property has had very stringent building code standards since the beginning  even before the theme park was begun they were known as the EPCOT Building Code reflecting Walts desire to innovate in community planning.  There are lots of theme parkspecific requirements in there above and beyond the standard national fire code  unfortunately its not available online as a PDF so I cant cite specific requirements that might be applicable in this situation   Its a pretty cool and notaswellknown contribution WDW has made to the community though!,WaltDisneyWorld,davhfoy,3,t5_2te6p

Anywhere you receive personalized service especially TS meals or hotel conciergebell hops taxi drivers mousekeeping etc. Front desk staff for check in and CS meals are not necessary to tip.

From a gaming stand point though you have to hit go to about  portal points there are only about  different portals total and the actual game mechanics are very grindy. Its a very long game from being to end and the camera reader technology needs to be upgraded.

10323003,0,t1_dce5u4r,thats part of it.. but really its all summed up in one mans dream. He dreamed and then made it reality. Walt never gave a tinkers damn about money. He fully exploited the concept of if you build it they will come. Later generations of leadership at DisneyCo were and to a certain point remain far more concerned with RoI and packing the parks. And I can see that concern. Laying out billions is kinda nerve wracking when you dont know if its ever going to be recouped. But Walt wanted Disney parks all over the US. The goal wasnt ever to have two huge complexes but to bring the magic everywhere. At some point that vision got stomped flat in the board room and the empire became about padding bottom lines. I think weve seen a shift in that with the most recent changes in the company and they are looking at expansion markets nobody would have dreamed existed  years ago Shanghai? really?. the problem is Florida is the cash cow that funds the rest of it so they play it safe there and stick with known items that fill seats and generate money rather than playing with avant garde edgy stuff. Ironically disneyland tends to be more cutting edge with stuff proven to work there eventually filtering into the place where we can do things weve never dreamed of in Florida. ,WaltDisneyWorld,dce63p2,2,t5_2te6p

If yall love rides plan your fast passes for the popular rides during the afternoon or early evening. If you get to the parks early ride the popular rides before crowds get bigger then ride them again using your fast passes during busy hours.Again it would be best to arrive at the parks when they open. Temp will be cooler and itll be less crowded. when it starts to get too hot by midlate afternoon take a break and head back to your hotel to rest up.

Now perhaps they can focus on other modern hospitality trends like ensuring accessible power outlets are present and updating furnishings to match current expectations. I still cant believe our room at AKL only had one nightstand and no power outlets convenient to both sides of the bed for charging devices.Disney is entitled to charge crazy prices for their resorts but it does create the expectation that they will at least operate the hotel to an equivalent standard of other national chains and they often dont live up to that.

They both worked DCP in Disneyland first then in Disney World.. years later they made it. Its a lot of hard work but also luck. Id try with big resorts in the area maybe even ones on actual Disney property like Four Seasons or SwanDolphin? If that doesnt interest you try SeaWorld of Universal.

10769495,0,t3_5tztyp,Yes as mentioned elsewhere you get your Magic Bands when you check in  which resort are you staying at?You can still link your stay to the MDE app and add dining reservations for  days out and Fast Passes from  days out from your stay. You should make sure your booking is linked within about a week of making it  if it isnt give Disney a call to make sure you have the correct reference number. You can also check in and make room requests through the app prior to your arrival though as you wont have a Magic Band youll have to stop by the front desk any way. Also Im not sure how necessary this is but if you intend to catch the Magical Express from MCO airport you should set it up on the website or call your travel agent to do so. We found it difficult to find the specific page on the site  best to Google and follow the instructions from the FAQ page. Are you arriving on an international flight or domestic? If the former then youll have to pick up your checked bags and clear customs and take them with you. If the latter unlike US visitors you wont get the baggage tags so when you land you need to present your airline baggage tags to the Magical Express desk or pick them up yourself and bring them with you. If you get Magical Express to deliver your bags to the hotel be prepared for it to take a very long time possibly even overnight if you arrive late  though they dont offer the service for arrivals after pm any way. So make sure you pack some clothes and essentials in carry on or bags you take with you. The Magical Express bus can be crowded and will likely stop at a few resorts  so expect it to take up to  minutes to get you to your hotel. Once you get to your resort you check in as normal and receive your Magic Bands and any additional information you require. You can get park maps etc too then if you want paper copies. As mentioned earlier if youve used Disneys baggage service they will simply deliver your checked bags to your room sometime in the following hours so you are free to do other things until then. Thats most of the booking and arrival process  anything else youre interested in? Hope this helps!,WaltDisneyWorld,ddqsl22,2,t5_2te6p

Because its buffet it equates a little more to Crystal Palace sans characters which is  child  adult.If you show up at open you can literally ride DMT  times in  minutes. You can then head over hit Pooh once its not worth more than that MR TOAD EVA do several runs on Peter Pan the detail is still fun there! then RETURN to DMT and do it a couple more times before they let the BOG crowd and rope droppers on.Then at  go grab some brekkie. The food is better than BOG.So its really a question of if you want one ride on DMT with BOG for cheaper or you want between  rides across the three attractions before a better breakfast at Pinocchios.

Anything after day  is going to be easy because there are so few folks that stay for longer than  days that there isnt much competition.  If you cant get CRT on that day just slip it until you can and youll find a slot.I would prioritize booking by day as opposed to by restaurant because the competition goes down as you get to later days with there being practically none at . Note Youll need to log on multiple times as you can only book for your first  days at  days out then each day another day opens up make sense?Start with your first day and if you cant get BoG for instance then see if you can get Ohana or CRT and slip BoG to the thth where youre more likely to get it.Id also recommend getting your husband on another computer working reservations as well.  Having two people makes things a lot easier.I also wouldnt stress too much.

11053138,0,t1_dektluq,Whether you go through Davids or directly through a DVC owner the owner has total control over the reservation. They could for example take your money and cancel the reservation or default on their dues. Davids is a reputable wellknown company that supposedly guarantees your transaction  so you have some extra peace of mind going through them. Their contract states youre due a refund if the owner screws you over. They also dont want a bad experience to tarnish their name so if an owner does screw you over theyll do whatever they can to make it right. An owner by themself could hypothetically just keep taking peoples money and cancelling reservations. I imagine the second someone does that through Davids though that theyre cut off from renting agencies and a significant portion of the rental market.

However that can be solved by making sure you use a certain amount each day.  Also something nice to know is at certain locations in the parks or hotels a QS credit can be used to get multiple snacks and drinks just depends.  I wish I had a list but I dont unfortunately just ask the Cast Member.  Its worth getting in my opinion to just put your mind at ease just beware though getting a dessert on every meal is kind of intense and unnecessary but they may have changed that for  not sure.Finally Id recommend against getting the Deluxe plan or whatever they call that with two fullservice dinners a day.  Its a ton of time wasted eating and a TON of reservations you need to make but usually fullservice places are the best themed and best food just food for thought.,WaltDisneyWorld,dfivdme,1,t5_2te6p
11354291,0,t3_6212kf,We get it because I just want pure convenience.  Dont have to worry about what money I have and if you do a bunch of character dinings you can save a little bit.  But its only really for convenience and it does limit where you can eat.  We got the deluxe one year and we lost so much time because table service will easily take . hours of park time but the middle one has been perfect for us.  Also my wife saves a ton of money just off the snack credit.  When we go to the parks she splurges on Starbucks and every Starbucks drink is a snack credit and you can put as many additions as you want.  I save money because I always eat steak out and this allows me to pretty much get the most expensive steak possible.  Use this to help you.  On my last trip we saved almost  dollars getting the middle plan on a  day trip.  That pretty much paid for the tips of our dinners.  Also with for not having to carry money or cards around at the park.  Unfortunately you still need your license just in case something happens.,WaltDisneyWorld,dfizknv,3,t5_2te6p

11366883,0,t1_dfk8499,Let it be a lesson in prioritization! Once you trade all your starter pins you like each pin trade is now a do I prefer this pin to the one I already have? Agonizing decisions but good learning moments. Then if they really like pin trading and you end up going to Disney again you could have the kids save up their own money to expand their pin collection. I like pin trading but I was never hugely into it. After  trips worth of pin trading adding on  starter packs per trip I probably have about  pins total that I keep on  lanyards  one trading lanyard and  nontrading lanyards. In my experience I think  pins is a good amount to start with. Its enough that you usually have  pins youre willing to trade at any given time but still affordable. ,WaltDisneyWorld,dfkexa1,3,t5_2te6p

11465151,0,t3_63memo,Problem with Tron for either MK or Epcot will be sidebyside coasters. In the MK it would wind up next to Space Mountain and be close to redundant.In Epcot the GotG coaster is a new coaster type and because of that its plans have been pushed to later four to five years from now but with Ratatouille now pushed to sooner than later. But it seems pretty set that that is what theyre going to do GotG Vol. is already greenlit. But that would mean Tron is going to be in the same neighborhood of a SciFi coaster... which is pretty redundant.According to insiders Tron has always been in the hunt but always near the back of the pack. If Vekoma tells Disney they cant get their special coaster to work... then maybe theyd settle for Tron.If anything put it in DHS where you now ride the movies. It can use more rides even it it would be a third coaster but its not duplicating a SciFi themed coaster there.,WaltDisneyWorld,dfvkgln,1,t5_2te6p

As a bunch of people will tell you it started as something to fill the slow times during the fall. Since there are less and less slow times there are less and less options that come up for free dining. I think people staying in moderateDeluxe resorts seem to have the most luck values from what I read keep getting less availability for free dining. And Ill add as well that a lot of people will tell you unless you eat a LOT free dining is usually a worse deal because without free dining you can get a room discount with you pay full rate I believe.
