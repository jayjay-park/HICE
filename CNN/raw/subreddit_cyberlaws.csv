259267,0,t3_1x0ufk,We cant rule out the possibility that Bigfoot may actually exist wandering parts of Alaska and Canada. Seriously the news agencies need to stop publishing this speculation bullshit. The FBI and CIA have already said that Snowden worked alone unaided by any foreign group and Snowden himself said that he couldnt hand over any information to any foreign intelligence agency if he wanted to  he already gave everything he had to the journalists he met with. The more the news reports speculative bullshit like this the more mouth breathers in America will believe it so cut it out. Clapper is at best speculating and more than likely only saying this to keep playing his agency up as the victim of cybertheft rather than the overreaching privacy violating Constitutionshredding and incredibly unnecessary branch of government that it is. ,cyberlaws,cf7mrdn,1,t5_2qxyy

1751685,0,t1_cjzvgp6,I think were going in circles at this point and I understand what youre talking about. I am representing the orders that the DoD put out in  not just the actions of the AF which went way beyond Navy Army and USMC also blocked the actual wikileaks site but not news sites. I only disagree about when something is declassified I agree on everything else.The government issued lots of guidance as wikileaks played out and in every case I read they maintained that the information was still classified which as you point out is a policy enforced through the NDAs youve signed and if national defense information through law via the espionage act. Part of that policy and guidance was to not discuss the information because you might inadvertently confirm or disclose information that had not been leaked and avoid storing it because it hadnt been declassified.The Navy and Army cant say about AF most certainly blocks wikileaks to this day. ,cyberlaws,cjzyi0l,3,t5_2qxyy

That is what happened and thats all I said.gtGoogle didnt ignore the request either. They simply missed it.You can accidentally ignore something. Ignore doesnt imply intent.Google is making fucktons of money off their services. Do they not owe the public a decent reporting service to request the removal of some photos?

3018532,0,t1_coalkng,Again we have done a poor job of rallying the public and quite frankly too many of us are assholes so in love with our own perceived victimhood that we did not take care to think about how we would be perceived by the public in this fight. Public perception is critical in a short attention span society.We should have been forming a coalition with other like minded groups but we wasted time insisting on the primacy of cause and defending people.Meanwhile the government continued to execute people in the street.Now were left chewing on each other and mad as hell that some politician did not give us something and the public has lost interest. It is hard to admit the part we played in losing the public but it is necessary. If we cannot reopen that window of opportunity we can at least put the issue in play come  and get it back in front of the public. Whether some of us are up for this I highly doubt it. It is much easier to be mad to be cynical and make excuses rather than accept responsibility for doing some very hard tedious and often unsatisfactory work of getting people to engage with this again.,cyberlaws,coav9v0,1,t5_2qxyy

5531584,0,t1_cwiozk7,No these are not interesting issues of law and technology and I understand the jesting here lol. What I wrote is simply the fundamental basis for why information security as a field exists. Understand that I have  years of experience in information security with  certifications and multiple graduate degrees. I am a senior level security analyst who happens to be transitioning into the legal intersection. As for how law helps an information security office you can start with the fact that most lawyers are completely clueless about technology. It is up to information security professionals to articulate under what circumstances a technology in use violates someones privacyimplementing outbound SSL decryption for all traffic on a firewall for example is a blatant violation of privacy. You then have to be familiar enough with employment law and business law to understand under what circumstances employees have privacy much less privacy in the public sector than private and are entitled to protections. This is an extraordinarily complex intersection.You have to have to understand contracts and license agreements in order to recognize liabilities or potential liabiltiies in a terms of use agreement obligations on behalf of which parties and their roles in a sensitive information spillage which results in an incident which usually comes in the form of a BAA signed between both parties. It also helps internally with service level agreements and roles and responsibilities of parties involved.You have to understand compliance with State statutes as vague as they are and articulate that to counsel as a means of security standards enforcement throughout an enterprise.Many lawyers do not understand core components of law in how they are embedded beneath the technologies implemented. Hell even searching through email for phishing campaigns can be a violation of an employees privacy which brings up risk management. There is a huge push right now for Lawyers to lead incident management processes because lawyers understand the legal obligationsprovided they have been trained to do soas a consequence of a data breach.Discouraging behavior within your company is often a core trait taught in Negotiation and Dispute Resolution as well which helps institute and further information assurance programs within your company which is proven to reduce the occurrence of insider threats.Or lets say someone in your organization thinks its a good idea to run a Tor node. Who is going to be able to explain the risks associated with doing so and the rights of the company in its defense? How about employees using their personal phones for work purposeslets say youre using exchange and the active sync client is used. Under what circumstances are the personal property of your employees their phones subject to discovery? Under what circumstance are you even obligated to notify your employees their personal property is discoverable?These are just a few issues which help you run a security program. BTW Ive ran security programs for the feds. ,cyberlaws,cwipieh,1,t5_2qxyy

6741684,0,t1_d0gmq0x,In the case of a pen register the US government sets up a warrant and then compensates the company for access to phone numbers conversations etc. It is within the companys duty to comply as the work isnt reasonably burdensome to the company.Having a company manually program a backdoor which the government as well as hack savvy rd parties accesses and will be used in the future to access much more than phone connections is entirely different. The work involved is significantly more difficult this is burdensome to Apple right out of the gatenot to mention how it will adversely affect their company but in a court of law that part wouldnt likely fare well as an argument.  You could start from the level of burden placed on Apple to do this work and connect it with the use of law as a stick to compel them when it isnt within their reasonable means.  ,cyberlaws,d0gnc0h,5,t5_2qxyy
