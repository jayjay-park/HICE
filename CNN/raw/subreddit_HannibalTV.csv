I get that by the time that Silence of the Lambs takes place Hannibal had been in prison for years which Im sure changed himbut its kind of hard to imagine Hopkins Hannibal being cool and calm enough to be a very! successful serial killer that avoided capture for so long. His passion his heat his arrogance should have led him to make a mistake that allowed his capture long before hed amassed such a large body count. Mads Hannibal is arrogant too but hes also restrained and methodical and clinical. Even though that Hannibal knows he is so much smarter and more superior than everyone else he doesnt take chances.

589217,0,t3_20vhnw,The show is a masterpiece of story telling at least it is for me. Ive heard people complain how it feels to procedural but I have never noticed that. Not once. Each episode feels like the procedural bit is just a way of flexing the relationship between the characters. The kills dont matter how the characters react matters. How Will confides in Hannibal how Jack deals with his own stress etc. It just feels like a vehicle for the show to move forward. The acting is fucking insane ESPECIALLY on Mads part. All the subtle facial expressions are damn smack on and couldnt be better. The acting from some of the supporting cast namely Katz in Season  was a bit weak but shes improved in this season now that they can flesh her out. I only hope Scott Thompson gets more screentime. I grew up in Canada and Kids in the Hall is enormous here as it is Canadian. What smacks me about the show is how intricately beautiful everything is. Even in its most dark and morbid moments you can find stunning beauty. Its quite rare youll find anything much less a TV show that can evoke awe while staring at the face of death. Also I make GIFs and I had some made from the moments you mentioned already. Id have added the floor bufferer but I havent gotten to that section of the episode yet. Still early on.

It seems like more times than not writersOr their family if theyre deceased absolutely abhor any working of their material that isnt exactly what they wrote or what they envisioned.

I dont think people will be calling this character Hannibal I just think hes the template.The Dracula thing is my own theory based on a few lines in the books. Namely the strange insistence in referencing Hannibals eye color. Its very like Bram Stokers descriptionphrasing. I could be totally wrong about that.I hear ya on the reboot business. Im not even gonna start because nobody needs to experience that rant. Not today at least.gt So...in this semiincoherent rant I have argued that Fullers Hannibal is a class  kaiju. Go me.Dammit.

I would imagine that his brain  picks up small things subconsciously and helps him come up with a reasonable explanation. And his perfect empathy helps him understand why the killer might do it. But its still fiction so you have to give some thugs a pass. Edit also I think every one is supposed to be spoiled with the information that Hannibal is a killer. Otherwise he would just seem normal.

Hasselstrom  tv spoilert My take total speculation OFC on that was most time he is on screen he is playing a lot of his own self struggling with his mind perhaps in his house or leaning more towards humanity with Reba and not the dragon which would be manifest during the murders.

4188344,0,t1_crxnp09,It says a lot about this show that we can have this conversation!Gideon didnt betray Hannibal the way that Will did.  He let Will see him and was rebuked in the S finale.  In my interpretation Will was the Judas figure that was left with his bowels spilling out.  He may have been told the real location of the foyer of his memory palace which is where Hannibal is now in reality but I dont think Will is welcome there right now in fantasy.  Another point to be made was how insistent Gideon was about how Hannibal would feel when this would all happen to him.  Hannibal was clear about who he considered his equal what constitutes cannibalism etc.  But I dont think anyone entertains the idea of eating anyone else quite like Hannibal does.  He seems to be the only one to imagine that anyone else would do it to him as opposed to Gideon suggesting it.  They both ask the other why they are allowing this to happen which I also took to mean that Hannibal was allowing his hallucination to be a bit unruly and uncooperative because he was still better company than Will the Betrayer.Maybe Im being selfish though.  I love Eddie Izzard and if hes a hallucination well get to see more of him.  If it was grounded in reality theres not much more to show.,HannibalTV,crxo7cv,2,t5_2vs7z

Gotta agree with OP on this one. Just occurred to me that theres a really big disparity between Will and Hannibal  Hannibal is cultured and refined while Will is more rough around the edges and common similar but not the same. Hannibals entire thesis is that they are the same without failing to account for the difference. It ironically makes him wrong but at the same time makes them perfect together.

4328296,0,t1_csdhqsz,Am I watching a totally different show here?  Theres been plenty of progression in the plot in the first three episodes about on par with the first two seasons.  If anything the pace is pretty fast  weve already had Hannibal and Will meeting again in the second episode and Will visiting the ancestral home of the Lecters!  All of the pieces are being set up for what Im sure will be an incredible resolution  we still have ten whole episodes to go. No drama.  Ill politely disagree with that one.  The Season  premiere had some of the most nailbiting drama out of any of the episodes particularly between Hannibal and Bedelia.

I keep sitting there thinking Has this show disappeared up its own arse? Has it listened to its own hype too much?Obviously the early episodes of season  were pretty formulaic and Im sure this was a trade off with getting the show made and financed in the first place.  It then slowly veered away from this structure and became more of an ongoing narrative punctuated by a periodic crime scene which again gave the show some structure.Whilst I still love the characters Id actually like some stuff to happen this series rather than what we are getting which in my humble opinion in the episodes so far is style over substance.,HannibalTV,csm923g,3,t5_2vs7z

In midJuly each year Bohemian Grove hosts a twoweek threeweekend encampment of some of the most prominent people in the world.gtThe Bohemian Clubs allmale membership and guest list includes artists particularly musicians as well as many prominent business leaders government officials including U.S. presidents senior media executives and people of power. Members may invite guests to the Grove although those guests are subject to a screening procedure. A guests first glimpse of the Grove typically is during the Spring Jinks in June preceding the main July encampment. Bohemian club members can schedule private dayuse events at the Grove any time it is not being used for Clubwide purposes and are allowed at these times to bring spouses family and friends though female and minor guests must be off the property by  or  pm.The parties that are constantly being brought up reference how the Bohemian Society has their secret parties as well.Im quite curious as to where they plan on taking this because its very interesting in a certain type of way completely different from season .,HannibalTV,ctdd3et,1,t5_2vs7z

The aftershave reference the famous did you just smell me? in season  episode  when Hannibal first smelled Wills disease is brought back here but this time it is plain for Will that Hannibal have exceptionnal smelling and has the ability to draw scary precise and often correct conclusions with it.    In the same episode I mentionned he smelled Bellas cancer and talk about his keen sense of smell in front of Jack go as far as to say that he was aware of one of his teacher having stomach cancer even before he was which purposely drew Bella in his cabinet for therapy. Yet Jack never connected the dots afterwards. Even Will was reckless about it when Hannibal smelled Freddie Lounds on him and knew that he was lying about her being dead.All in all Im kind of glad now that they made it more clear for viewers as theres no doubt now that Will is well aware about this singular trait of Hannibal.,HannibalTV,ctohtye,76,t5_2vs7z
4713783,0,t3_3fh2ec,After a whole season of Hannibal and Will fighting for Sclarice Clarlings soul with Hannibal in jail manipulaying her and Will in a Jack Crawford kind of position Clarice helps Hannibal escape.  The two find Will in his home and assault him. However as Hannibal lectures a near incapacitated Will Clarice hits Hannibal from behind knocking him out. Will falls unconscious shortly afterwards. The two wake up tied to chairs across from each other in a dining room. They look at each other with a mix of love and hatred in their eyes. Suddenly Clarice comes to the dining room  carrying two covered dishes. She sets them in front of Will and Hannibal. After a moment of awkward silence the two lift open the covers to reveal that they are in fact going to eat each others cooked legs.Silence. Then laughter. Will and Hannibal laugh like madmen as if sharing an inside joke. This was what they wanted all along. Armed with the knowledge that Clarice will feed them with each other until they die  Hannibal and Will can truly forgive one another dying as friends and as equals. They laugh even harder and Clarice joins them as well. Cue some slowmo artsy shots of them laughing and eating. The image slowly fades to black ending with Will Graham saying  This was our design.,HannibalTV,ctopm5y,6,t5_2vs7z

4745944,0,t3_3fx4dr,So I know pretty much zero about the novels so I cant speculate much based on that unfortunately. Others please do! I love hearing about this stuff. Caution Im going to be discussing the quotes mentioned above so dont read if you dont like interview spoilers.Based on the first quote Im guessing Hannibal wont be in prison at the end of the season. I still think Will is going to be traumatized by something his family being killed by Dolarhyde? and get some extremely violent revenge hence the name of the last episode. At that point maybe Hannibal shows up and helps him cover it upframe someone for the crime. I have a feeling Will is going to end up hurting someone he likes too out of necessity  maybe Jack. They talk about an inversion and a return to the first season... that makes me think of the procedural elements but he specifically says it would be a new kind of storytelling so... maybe not. Maybe theyre talking about the way Hannibal manipulates people without them knowing and hides in plain sight. In which case the inversion could be Will doing that instead triggered by having to cover up his revenge crime.Ah man I am way overthinking this.

5488092,0,t1_cwd40jn,...I dont know why but for some reason ever since the start of the rewatches Im one of the only people who posts all the time in every post. There was couple of others who kept up at first but they seem to have dropped off.The reason I dont know why is because when people first asked for the rewatches to happen there was a lot of people who chimed in I think about  dozen? on the post saying they were game. That it was a great idea. Then I guess interest waned or shifted?The idea was to first wait a month or a couple for the fallout of the finale to wear off then start it up.A lot of people had the same idea with rewatching the show all over again and planned on doing liveposts as well on twitter happening on Thursday night US and Saturday night UK. When the first twitter livepost happened I decided that we should keep all the major rewatches happening at the same time so we stay on the same episode. The other people who first brought up the idea of the rewatches didnt really chime in so it came down to me to sort of take over the duties. The mods have certainly taken a step back on things.I gave my word to do the rewatch postings so even with lower interest I kept it up. The twitter rewatches are happening as well even with lower turnouts due to the fall tv season kicking in. So every Thursday night for the US the Hannibal tag on twitter starts with the livepost rewatchings and they have an ep tag as well. Every Saturday night for the UK there is another rewatch livepost on twitter with their own separate ep tag. Then at Saturday night for the US I post the ep thread.At first when it started I did it with few more frequent replies although shorter through the ep. I would frequently pause Amazon Video and write down favorite lines from the ep. So I was falling back on time anyways.It would be a few days then other people would come and comment. So...I guess from day one the first ones to comment was me and someone else? Then about Tuesday or Wednesday other people join in. As I realized the first night was only me...I decided that when my favorite scenes would come on I would post the dialog because its really fascinating the words and body language Hannibal and Will have especially towards each other in their scenes. This in turn lowered the comment amount that I made I think the first post  or  of them were all mine? but made the posts longer they also made more sense when I would gush about events happening. shrugsThen when we hit my favorite episodes in which every scene is gold I kept it up. So its basically become me just writing down the dialog of the scenes with commentary throughout the post. I planned on doing it for meta reasons anyway so why not. It just takes a VERY long time to do this. I cant start watching the ep at the posted livepost time of pm ET because of college football and fighting for the tv and then the news. So I wait until about am ET to start. Then I pauseplay the entire ep while writing down the dialogue and scenes I like. It usually takes me about  hours to do this.I think some people like it but without anyone commenting they hate it or what not I dont plan to stop. Everyone can comment on the ep in the manner that they choose while being respectful to everyone.I would like it if others would comment...they dont have to comment on my posts but just comment on the ep. It does feel...as if it is an exercise in futility to be one of the few people who comments on the eps and the only one who comments as much as I do.If it wasnt for the fact I gave my word to do this...and that people do seem to enjoy it considering how the posts still get upvotes I would stop.Ive thought about it. That I would just post the ep discussion thread and not comment but I think I fear that no one would comment at all and it just seems...sad to have the threads for the rewatch be posted with no or few comments. So I continue. shrugs,HannibalTV,cwd5kat,3,t5_2vs7z

Of course we want them to be together but that can never happen in a totally satisfying way. The characters cant be happy all the time that isnt TV. There should be conflict. Obviously we will  see Hannibal and Will on the run and finally together when the show returns. But there would be a twist. Personally I think Hannibal will be paralyzed or lose his memory and thats what will lead Graham to stay with him because he feels responsible for him. But it will hopefully never be a sitcom about two gay murderers like some people want.

8985701,0,t1_d7rt9di,gt That one is very difficult to answer and is mostly left to interpretation I think.Exactly and it doesnt really matter. If he cared about her it wasnt enough to save her like you said and if he didnt care for her shed end up dead anyway. Either way we end up at the same point. The only way I see her not end up as dead is if Will had taken no interest in her and Hannibal just ignored her existence after the Hobbes affair. That of course would have been an entirely different first season and the glory that is Mizumono wouldnt exist. I think maybe a better question would be What does caring for a person mean to Hannibal? because ultimately whether youre a pig or have spent time behind the veil youre not safe. Looking from the outside it would be easy to say Hannibal doesnt actually care for others but it would be interested to have him explain what he thinks caring for someone entails. ,HannibalTV,d7rxywr,4,t5_2vs7z
9049044,0,t1_d7n0egb,I think they are just obsessed with them not so much love them Hannibal is obsessed with Clarice we see this in several parts of the movie. But there is one big difference Hannibal would never harm Clarice in any way you see it that last scene this Hannibal harmed Will a lot even tried to kill him twice he also fostered codependency like Will said he hurt him isolated him and manipulated him to be like him as some kind of puppet or little project of his not unlike Abigail but it was a lot deeper with Will so I think both Hannibals are obsessed with ClariceWill but Hopkins Hannibal loved Clarice more than Mads Hannibal loved Will the fact that he always protected her and is the only person he never harms in the book its the same is telling she brings a good side out of him. Mads Hannibal is just obsessed with Will he didnt bring any good side of him quite the opposite and his obsession also made him weaker and kind of caused all his downfalls.He was possessive too when he was isolating him and wanted Will to have no one but him.Even if Fuller romanticized and glorified the constant abuse I will never see that as love I cant.. you cant harm someone you love so deeply and so many times. Youd protect them like Hopkinsbook Hannibal always protected Clarice all he wanted was Clarice to love him. All this Hannibal wanted was Will to be like him because he was alone and Will is the only person he considered worthy and on his level.,HannibalTV,d7zju92,2,t5_2vs7z

9976907,0,t3_5iglrh,Excellent question! Once I get home Ill have to rewatch the scene to take it all in once again but I think your analysis is spot on especially about the falling in love and the wine part. The thing that Ive never picked up on and that makes all of this a bit clearer is that while the show doesnt put much emphasis on it Will lives a really long way from Hannibal like about . hours of drive away somebody posted an analysis of the distances on tumblr Ill try to find it and link to it when I get back. So that makes the wine move  that much weirder  Will just randomly thinks of Hannibal so he drives  hours to Baltimore there he goes to a shop and buys a wine that he thinks Hannibal might like the best despite being a hardliquor type of person himself he simply remembers how much Hannibal loves wine and just goes to see Hannibal at his home and gives him the wine and chats with him a little. But he seems nervousshy and once it gets too social for his introverted soul he decides to leave even though that means missing Hannibals fancy dinner. And then he just drives  hours again to get home DYeah I do think this marks the time Will really gets hooked on Hannibal and starts to be unable to get him out of his head...,HannibalTV,db80ovc,13,t5_2vs7z

11049616,0,t3_5xmeqi,Just the first and last episode. For the commentary they just did it one day and they had Bryan Fuller Hugh Dancy and David Slade together for it. In Season  David Slade only directed three episodes the pilot the final and the third episode. I dont recall the third episode having commentary but at least the first and last do.In general the Season  Bluray is pretty skimpy on bonus features. What features it does have are great theres just not a whole lot there. Season  and Season  they did a great job pimping out with special features.,HannibalTV,dekgdzb,1,t5_2vs7z

11511456,0,t3_649epj,Honestly there are so many things in hannibal that would put you in the ER if you drink every time they happen. Some of my favourites areEvery time Will or Hannibal speak purely in metaphors.For every dog you see.Every time ravenstag and demon stag man make an appearance.Every time full names are used for no reason  Will Graham Garret Jacob Hobbs Alana Bloom...Every time you hear this is my design or tell me Will or how did that make you feel?.  Every time someone makes that bewilderedconcerned expression after Will says something weird. Drink again if its Jack.  Every time Bedelia drinks.Every time Hannibal makes a cannibal pun. Seriously the list can go on forever. But yea there is a lot of God talk particularly at the start of season . I actually found Hannibals perspective on god a pretty interesting insight into his character though. Sort of like a little crack in his person suit thats letting his real thoughts stream out. ,HannibalTV,dg0tpy9,31,t5_2vs7z
11598789,0,t3_63u745,Ive only read Red Dragon and only after watching the show and movie adaptations of it.Personally I feel the source is weaker than all the adaptations. Its handling of women is awful it doesnt really seem to know what the most interesting part of its narrative is Hannibal is really vestigial except as a backstory to Will theres a lot of Toothfairy backstory that feels really clunky and unnecessary it doesnt add anywhere near as much interest or depth to his character as his love interest who unfortunately being a woman in this book is really flat and the ending feels really rushed with more than a few notes that seem to be there just to try and hammer the reader for a few more beats.That said it has real meat to it and theres a lot of good to dig for.
