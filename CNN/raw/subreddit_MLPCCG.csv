5158,0,t3_1u62u7,So I havent actually played the game yet but lots of people are talking about it so Im guessing its pretty fun. Are there plans for an online system where i can register what cards I have in my deck say each card has a number attached to it or something and play people online?

12361,0,t3_1u6bio,When I think about cards I always think of the cards as being  AT in value.  This is because in order to draw a new card I would need to spend an AT.If I see a situation where I can get multiple cards for a smaller investment then I will do that.  On down the road that investment might mean I have the answer to a play in my hand instead of on top of my deck.Card advantage is more important for control heavy decks such as the  color one I am playing around with.,MLPCCG,cefubb0,2,t5_2y3vv
45974,0,t1_cef6y9e,The rulebook says Mane Characters cant be targeted by cards and effects that target Friends and they cant be removed from play.The key to determining whether you can play a card on a Friend a Mane Character or either is in the targeting information on the card. If a card specifies Friend then it can only be played on Friends and not Mane Characters. If a card specifies Mane Character then it can only be played on Mane Characters and not on Friends. If it specifies character then it can be played on either as Friends and Mane Characters are both characters.,MLPCCG,cejny46,1,t5_2y3vv

101932,0,t1_ceq0fvj,I  agree that is what the intent was. However I dont remember any specific or clearly stated rule about what constitutes an ability with a trigger conferring exactly one use vs abilities that can be used as often as you can pay the AT. In MtG such things were taken care of by whether or not you had to tap the card. But in MLP it seems like plenty of nonexhaust abilities are meant to only have one use. There needs to be a keyword or something IMO.TLDR I think they really need to write the competitivecomprehensive rules in a way that makes it completely clear what the cards can do no gray areas.

This way you can also set down a Troublemaker if you have one available.If I drop Big Shot and Rising Star I literally cannot play any of my Generosity cards until Rarity is boosted which means Id be looking for  cards only  of which Id be able to Turn  boost.Edit I guess Id still be looking for that to boost even if I didnt have Big Shot or Rising Star but I wouldnt be able to play Stand Still on Turn  without Rising Star as well as Turn  Troublemaker.,MLPCCG,ceramcb,1,t5_2y3vv

269966,0,t1_cf8bga0,Tremendous post wish I could upvote it a dozen times.I proudly play blueyellow aggro since control just doesnt win for all the reasons you mentioned.  Speed is just too efficient.  Even a villain bomb often comes up short since the aggro deck already scored that problem bonus and can now abandon it.  Theyll unfrighten the one important friend Holly Dash and replace the others from hand.  Responsibility Pie is too slow for the same reason they already confronted that problem and dont care if they lose a friend from it.  Or they just doublefacedoff and their characters arent even at problems.For this control deck Nest Weaver might even be too inefficient.  Id play Savoir Fare instead  extra power automatically for less cost and no discard dependency.  Lyra also seems slow but I havent seen her in action yet.  And Carousel Boutique is even worse than you say its  because it costs the two actions and just replaces itself as a card.The colorfixers like Getting Hooves Dirty work for only one use on turn  to play a card that repays the spent action right away.  Twilight Organizer Guidance Counselor maybe Ursa Vanquisher Spring Forward if it will immediately win a faceoff for Studious.  Pink and white dont have anything to justify the colorfixer Lyra isnt enough.,MLPCCG,cf8qqcn,1,t5_2y3vv

289364,0,t3_1xexw9,I love Sweet and Kind to accelerate out Guidance Counselor on turn .  Mr. Breezy is good there too although half the time youll go second and they will have spent all  actions to flip their mane.  Or even Barn Raiser to get her home quickly after the first faceoff.  And Barn Raiser makes color fixers perfectly worth playing converting them to endofturn power later in the game.  Nice synergy package here.Skeptical of Picnic Lunch not sure you have enough yellow friends to trigger it reliably especially considering it doesnt count the Fluttershy mane so once shes at a problem three yellow friends is overkill.  And Critter Cavalry beats Working Together even with your high average flip power since Barn Raiser is your only Applejack and she works from home.  I see your other thread about it being antiParasprite tech suppose it might work though Id rather just play Cavalry.Silver Spanner doesnt seem right in a deck that doesnt have a selfdismissing resource to combo.  Shes just overcosted and dead in hand against anything but yellow.  At best she forces an opponent to keep a PiedBandaged friend at home instead of dismissing it when over limit but then Spanner is occupying a home slot of yours too so you dont come out ahead.Very nice set of problems every one helps you thats something not many decks can say.  Sweet Apple Acres is good because of the  opponent requirement.  Interesting choice of Thorn in Paw instead of a  starting problem I havent had much experience seeing how that plays out.,MLPCCG,cfar9ot,1,t5_2y3vv
354346,0,t3_1y52al, cards. Pretty hefty size.Is there a reason why Pinkie is main instead of Rainbow Dash? RD is easier to flip and has a better boosted effect for rushing down. Also having Laughter as the secondary color is a lot easier because it has  different cards that have no color requirements Flitter Rising Spirits Apple Brown Betty Not counting Goldengrape still need evidence hes good.Seeing as how you have no troublemakers Surprise seems very unnecessary. Youd only flip the TM face down and then on your opponents turn its flipped face up giving you zero Troublemaker phase breathing time. Also shes really expensive for  power return and a time use effect.You should probably be running an additional Emerald Green or Sweetie Sunrise instead of Cerulean Skies just to help out with power requirements. ,MLPCCG,cfhhtpg,1,t5_2y3vv
380781,0,t1_cfk7zl8,I kept  playsets of every rare for ddcks and set collection purposes.In addition at the time that inventory was listed I didnt really see a reason to post  of each rare.

Nobody really knew  where prices were going to go and I didnt want to sell  Cloudchasers to a grifter at  of their value.By keeping half of my inventory unlisted it enables me to keep cards in stock and keeps the community from experiencing a card famine where nobody anywhere can find a copy of a particular card.I do keep a close watch on the behavior and quantity of the cards available though.

Too Much Pie is an automatic inclusion but its the only other orange card worth playing.Orange mane opening up the space to run  other colors is an interesting idea.

Beaverton would be the card to go  note that he doesnt actually work to flip Fluttershy because the only way to reach  yellow is to have another critter.Speaking of that yellow entry is a problem.

552884,0,t1_cg32et8,It could be true Its just the ambiguity around the wording  . doesnt actually define that the involved characters are only tallied up during that window only that if they are moved to the problem theyre involved there. I suppose if its ruled the other way though you could have fun things where you move a character away from that Faceoff problem in the second priority window and still have it count and apply power as they remain involved from the first step.A card would be defined as counting for that faceoff from the definition in the first priority window and yet the combined power value is only tallied in the second priority window  thus to use an example  if you had an Amethyst Star at the Faceoff problem without any critters you could make it count for the faceoff then move it to the other problem  with critters  thus gaining the  bonus. Not the best example but it counts.Or even better worse? salvaging a highpower character from that faceoff yet still having it count for power! and shifting it to the other problem to get a head start on that or boosting your defense if the opponents turn is next and avoiding the cost move from home later.e.g. On your turn you trigger a faceoff on one problem and then move your Octavia to the opposite problem after the flip and still gain her  power on the first. Regardless of win or lose Octavia isnt sent home at the end of the faceoff as characters are only sent home from a problem that is being replaced per . and she is no longer at that problem then upon the Opponents turn they now have to deal with the  move cost at the second problem. Now repeat that but with a RDHolly DashWildfire movement chain to the second problem with all of them still contributing their power to the first. ... Im now kinda hoping its ruled the first way after realising all that. oO,MLPCCG,cg34bfj,1,t5_2y3vv
555551,0,t1_cg34bfj,Yeah. With the way the rules are worded moving your Octavia post flip to another problem definitely sounds like double dipping  and thats ridiculous.

649131,0,t3_21jk3f,I like this card a lot.  I really like their whole promo series and want this one too.  The main issue I have is just the Generosity deck theme of scoring additional points drives me crazy.  I dont know how it is everywhere else but where I am Generosity and Magic just entirely dominate the scene.  Magic really just because people put Lady Justice in absolutely everything and Generosity because eeeevverryyyonneeee uses Rarity Truly Outrageous.  Theyre the only element in the game with any sort of score boosting effect and it often makes them entirely possible to catch.

The deck has no way to discard efficiently unless your opponent plays NMM or other discard effects.  In the second version it isnt worth it to increase the deck size to  as it would make it more difficult to discard the cards you want.The deck doesnt run showdown cards to guarantee a faceoff for Fancy Pants nor does it run blue movement Wild Fire Holly Dash Fears Must be Faced Rainbow Dash Winged Wonder to rush to a double faceoff.The amount of AT needed to perform the Rainbowshine combo is unlikely to be reached in constructed play.

More rounds sounds great in theorizing online but in practice in person not so much.By the time the last round of each flight came around both the players and the judges were pretty tired and more eager for the flight to end than to run another round.  And often the extra round or two doesnt even affect the standings since the top couple players tend to stay in the top positions even after a loss because they have the highest tiebreakers.  And for players out of the running the extra rounds are more of a painful grind than fun.Regionals really did the concept with more flights rather than more rounds.

They had a frightened friend at home and wanted to know if they could move it during the main phaseI assume they did not want to be over home limit but couldnt unfrighten and move.

1294826,0,t1_cif76li,That is a very clever tech running the UR Celestia for the increased home limit. If youre looking to run more of a control deck you could still run a Flutter yellow engine w the control back up. Building a deck around pumped cards is a good idea and Nurse Redheart is insane. You are correct in assuming that hitting  yellow is going to be a hurdle for you to overcome so the first thing you should probably do is change your mane from Celestia to the new Fluttershy. If you can do that since it is arguably the best mane atm then why not. Youre also running A LOT of pumped friends. The real problem Ive seen with this is that if youre facing off you can only choose  to pump. Red Heart Eagle and Fancy Pants are amazing. Youre already running x showdowns and x Eep! so I dont think Donut Joe is super needed here. The first thing I would do would be to cut him out for some Owls but the double edged sword is your flip will go down. Doctor Horse is also a great card but owl does the same thing and youll have the added benefit of not needing to choose which friend is getting pumped. Since youre heart set on using Celestia then I would probably run something closer to this gtYellowWhite Fixer is going to be your best friend here. The Critter Stampede can come out for Photo Finish if youre having issues w Friend presence and you also feel like coming up w  yellow is giving you issues. Also what I would take out for another entry level yellow friend if youre having issues put if youre really in a bind you can always find a way to flip your Mane. ,MLPCCG,cifa9a1,2,t5_2y3vv

Cards like Big Shot Fashion Week and especially Rarity Truly Outrageous have their impact in points regardless of at power and hand.  If these types of abilities didnt exist then Id say youre right.  Since these types of cards are in play I feel they should be on the list.Also your problem deck is something where points as a resource can be considered for any deck.  What problems youre putting in and what it will take to confront them means a lot.  If youre going to overlook your problem deck then you might find yourself in a bind mid game where you may have the AT or the Power or even the Cards but not the points.Also consider the situation where you have confronted your problem and your opponent has confronted theirs.  You have  AT  cards in your hand and  power on the table you and your opponent are both at  points....  However if you DFO even winning the FO will put you only to  points and your opponent with  fresh problems may be able to get an easy  points giving them the win.  Since the points arent on the table to win the game all of that AT Power and Cards in hand are worth nothing for this turn.  Pass let your opponent either make the mistake of scoring to  and giving you fresh problems or FO the next turn where it will get you the win.Points are the resource that you must manage properly to win this game.,MLPCCG,cj32e9t,2,t5_2y3vv
1504122,0,t1_cj4rfqc,Im not entirely sure I agree with the idea that I have no flip power. Looking at decks like Pegasus Explosion and Ballroom Blitz I have a slightly better consistency since Im running  different  power flips rather than a fewer amount of higher powered cards. Not to mention that my average flip power is higher. I do think changing over to PTO and a hopeful orangeblue fixer would help along those lines though.RTO and multiple flips are something to be aware of I agree but oftentimes another decks average flip will be roughly  power on average which is a gap that Mauds ability can make up for easily. Luna is a problem on faceoffs but thats kind of her schtick and she can put out bursts of power while Maud is much more consistent and doesnt require me to toss away cards.Farm Foremare is tempting but availability is a serious issue here. Id love to toss her in if I get my hands on any. The lack of deck recycling is very intentional  Changeling Infiltrator throws Maud back down to  power and Ive never had problems with milling out. Id be more worried about villians and troublemakers delaying me if I wasnt consistently able to land  power on problems at a moments notice which Ive been able to.Thanks for the feedback though! ,MLPCCG,cj4tcpn,1,t5_2y3vv

1863437,0,t3_2fwkap,I like this deck. Most of the flaws I find actually arent flaws. Though Timberwolf is an odd choice but as a counter to SampS one of the most powerful cards in the game right now I guess that makes some sense.One strategy critique Critter Stampede is not the answer to OP you think it is. Unless youre somehow acquiring  yellow power with no yellow friends on the board on OPs turn. If you have the yellow power OP will hoofwrassle you before playing Twi and get rid of the stampedes. If you dont have the power cause youre going for MitM andor NMMManual mill then obviously you have no way of playing it if they go for the Selfie Loop.Similar critique one Fluttergui even turn  is not enough to stop OP especially against a slow deck like this.That being said OP does have trouble against this deck. Stampede and single FLuttergui just are not the reasons why unless they dont yet have a GT.Again this deck intrigues me. Im not sure yet that its the best control deck out there but theory crafting is good. I wonder how it handles VBC...Side Note Monstrous Manual did not single handedly make Control viable again. All of the following helped Bell Tower Instant flipping villains is so good its worth splashing for in Maudlike  Vinyl Drawing cards is good A. K. Yearling see above MitM AT management and penaltyless villain confronts help control win eventually Pinny Lane AT management in nonpurple can help Purple out. Requires other cards to be effective but at her maximum potential she helps control more than ATO does Monstrous Cave Villainother TM tutor. Trust me when I say this is an amazing tool. Snips and Snails Yeah this isnt just an aggro or combo card it is a control card too. Theres a reason I think its the best card in Pinks arsenal right now. I dare say its strength is comparable to RTOs thanks to its flexibility. If it was an Ultra Rare wed all be broke. Changeling Swarm Being able to undo villains is a great tool for control Maud Pie Being able to farm your own villains this easily makes control fasterMM helped control a lot.

2111886,0,t1_cl87qkh,I see the  as completely different deck archetypes.  A mid range deck actually does not use Farm villians for points as their primary score method.  A Midrange deck goal is to play better friends then the opponent and win through confronting and winning problem faceoffs.  A deck that focuses on Villian farming is a Bomb deck because the deck is Bombed out.That does not mean that a deck could not be classified as MidrangeBombs just like how Taxes would be considered Midrange Control while some Pink Blue lists would be considered Midrange Aggro.Villains do not Block Scoring rather they are the closest thing the game has to Board Wipes.  They also provide an alternative win condition of I am going to hamper my opponent and score cards at the same time.Because of this I consider high power curve multi villian decklist to be Bomb lists.

2955115,0,t3_2u08f6,Long time Magic player here. The reason pack wars works in Magic compared to any other game Ponies Pokemon YuGiOh etc is that your means of playing your cards is added to your pack after opening and the rules do not have to be drastically altered to play. In Ponies because theres no means of adding lands and beyond picking your mane the possibility of facing dead cards is there. Imagine pulling a card with a required  purple and you have no means of playing purple cards...youre kind of stuck even with crystalized guys. In order to make the format balanced the rules would have to be drastically changed and the beauty of pack wars is that barring adding lands you dont need to change the rules.

There are the two obvious extremes the hat deck I posted last week being one and stuff like the OrangeWhite deck or Dream Quest being at the other end. But both the world and this game are not that Black and White. So Im trying to cover some of the ground in between because the game has players who might like that.

3662696,0,t1_cq9r4lm,Id love to see how it performs in the hands of professionals. If possible could you also test it against the most popular decks in the current meta? I am only able to construct this deck using the card pool of my local play group and that involves dipping into our own decks for the pieces. Because of this Ive only had the opportunity to test it against Canterlot Nights era Pegasus Explosion and Big Bombs funnily enough since this deck is an evolution of a deck that has itself evolved from Big Bombs. Testing in my local group has proved it to be reliable if a little predictable. Out of the six games I played with it I lost once against Pegasplosion due to drawing into six Troublemakers in a row even with Ancient Research to help me out. That is my only real gripe with the deck. The draws still can let me down. otherwise its very consistent in faceoffs so I achieved the goal I set out for.Link to final cut I have included Twilight Sparkle Gala Greeter as a contender for Mane. As far as Im concerned either one could prove equally as effective though I will give the edge to Princess Luna Dream Catcher both for its tutor and its easier to meet conditions. Also allowing access to The Sun and The Moon rather than Team Effort or other Twilighttrigger Event does help. Five power is a definite upgrade over four after all.EDIT I forgot about Twinkleshine.

I agree and disagree on some of his points but the main thing I took away from this is that bronies are a diverse group and its hard to bunch them all together. Personally I dont like Twilights Secret Shipfic Folder. Its incredibly barebones as a game and when I told my friend as muchParaphrased in am ore polite manner mind you he replied that it was supposed to be an storyweaving game of funny jokes and erratic comedy. That disinterested me immediately. I had more personal fun as in just by myself reading the flavortext and looking at the cool art than actually playing the game. I still had quite a bit of enjoyment because I was with my friend and it was funny and cool just being with him playing a game.As for the state of the game I agree it is poor. But I dont think thats fair to call it quits on a game thats barely out of its shell. Many of the points made here could easily applied to MOBAs with their extreme learning curve complicated systems. Magic had its own problems and I would say we give Enterplay a bit more time to fully flesh out the game.There a lot more factors that should be considered so while some of your points hit true some of them I have to disagree with.,MLPCCG,cqtakyy,1,t5_2y3vv

3886153,0,t1_cqz575u,Well first off its labelled as v. for a reason  its not done.  And thats precisely why Im posting it here seeking feedback.  And thats also why Im posting it as a Deck Theory  its all theorycrafting.  However to address what youve brought up...gtRTOThe deck doesnt really need an answer to RTO.  RTO doesnt do anything if she cant confront and with villains standing nearly fulltime theres no way shell be doing that.gtSampSWithout recycling from the discard Snips and Snails can at best deal with  villains.  That offers at best  turns confronting.  Even with fresh bonus problems thats only  points.  The deck should have villains out essentially fulltime.  If you try to mix SampS and RTO I have a better chance of getting NMStar into play before you have both SampS and RTO which fully disables SampS.  Furthermore cycling my problem deck is a bad idea since  of my  problems offer me an instant TM reveal making the villain wall easier to maintain.gtCarboloaderLike SampS Carboloader serves no function whatsoever once Nightmare Star is in play.  However theres one critical thing with Carboloader  She needs friends to exhaust.  Since I can frighten at either problem nearly atwill the only place Carboloader can safely stockpile friends is at home.  Theres also the issue of flip averages  a deck relying on Carboloader is going to have a lower flip average because it will be maximizing friends to increase flip counts  that means cheaper and weaker earth ponies.  If your decks flip average is ..  not unreasonable for a Carboloader deck  assuming equal starting power you will need  flip in nearly any faceoff and  flips in the majority of them.  And if I use even a single of my flip events you are often going to need to add an extra  flips to match the average of my two flips.  Thats a lot of AT youre spending just to get those friends into play which gives me the time I need to farm my points and establish a lead.And thats for one faceoff.  Unfortunately for Carboloader she can either attack my villains on your turn burning her flips then or she can defend the villains from my assault on my turn but trying to split the difference makes doing both very difficult.  And if I have already established a lead I can simply continue to kill my villains as they turn face up at the problem  they dont frighten Shys army and theyll die before you get the opportunity to do anything.  Outracing at that point is going to require a heavy investment in control or a fair amount of luck.Now that said Carboloader is the biggest threat out of these cards by a fair margin.  As I mentioned before this deck is incomplete and I have modified the deck already.  Ive made changes to it that I havent posted mostly because I intend for the next version to be a fully tested complete deck primer.  The modified version contains an additional answer to Carboloader.  It also contains an answer to Maud who is a sizable threat but not as big a threat as Carboloader.  Maud  Carboloader gets out of hand though.gtLike I dont want to be all negative but your post makes it sound like this deck will wreck everyones shit.I dont know how youre getting that impression.  Literally the only thing I wrote about what decks it will beat is limited to one long sentencegtTheres not much in the way of answers for things that are designed to bust TMs so this deck is nowhere near invincible but I strongly suspect this will absolutely destroy most aggro decks and will fare well toetotoe with Carboloader based Orange decks.This is not an unreasonable assumption given the deck.  Aggro decks will have extreme trouble as apart from Snips and Snails and Epic Win they have to bash down the TM wall with aggros typically abyssmal flip averages forcing them to overcommit and risk a villain bomb frightening the field.  This is a natural property of decks in this archetype  Aggro struggles against it and it goes strongly against Aggros preferred style of play  raw efficiency.Toetotoe is not a statement of superiority but actually implies roughly equal footing meaning that I think it will be able to meet Maud and Carboloader on the field and stand a chance of winning at Mauds own game.The matchup that will be interesting to see with this deck is against various control archetypes as it is slow but efficient once it is running.  It gives Control time to establish the board position it wants but then has efficiency that lessens controls ability to actually control the field effectively.,MLPCCG,cqz96ym,1,t5_2y3vv

Raze this Barn is so so. Id recommend definitely swapping one of those for Want it Need it best problem for Orange decks and perhaps Freeing Discord Hungry Hungry Caterpillar or Fruit Bat Round Up.Friends Like the other guy said Pie Sisters is killer for OrangePink decks.

4016059,0,t1_crdnbhy,gtI run eighteen Troublemakers. The most an opponent could possibly deal with through effects alone is nine retire three SampSs bring them back with Pinkie Charm...er... Epiphany and play three Epic Wins Note how costly the development is on each of these is. Epiphany and Epic Win both cost AT to play and have a requirement of  in Pink and Blue respectively. SampS requires only Pink to play but costs AT. Seeing how SampS fulfills most of the requirement on Epiphany othe Friends would likely be dismissed for being in excess of the home limit pending drawing into something like High Spirits or Flitter. Not to mention that SampS is the nominal target of Epiphany it would be prudent to actually have it in the discard pile first. That means a standard minimum of AT needs to be spent to get past each Troublemaker AT  AT  AT with this synergistic play. On top of that there is the Blue requirement of Epic Win to consider. AT for a singleuse effect powerful though it undoubtedly is still comes in as being quite a costly effect. Getting to the Blue would at best be an investment of AT one each for a drop Pegasus to boost RDHO. So this is the nominal maths involved. Also consider that the Pink requirement would also need a Power Pink Friend SampS does not fill this role due to its own requirement in addition to your Flitter or High Spirits. xAT for SampS xAT for Epiphany xAT for Epic Win xAT for Power Pink EntryLevel Friend the Apple Family one xAT for Pink Pegasus xAT for Blue PegasusgtThis means that a standard minimum of AT needs to be spent in order to bypass only half of my Troublemakers. What happens after that? Whats the game plan for a destruction deck when they run out of cards to play?They dont need to even deal with  TMs though. Epic Win defeats the TM scoring its points then they play to the problem to score. SampS clears the problem and they play grab the points and bonus from the new one. If theyre running a pinkwhite build they can snag pts with an RTO in that one move for  AT total. Purple push effects are all main phase so you cant use them on your opponents turn. If you spend your AT setting up more TMs and pushing your opponent away youre not spending your AT to score points.I love control ran purple based villain control in the past and am currently fiddling with purpleorange purplewhite and purpleorangewhite ideas off and on but there are a lot of answers to it especially because a lot of the big hitter cards cant be used on your opponents turn.,MLPCCG,cre27nc,1,t5_2y3vv

4681613,0,t1_ctkmtig,Thats the thing about the MLPCCG. There are a lot of exceptions to any rule. My articles are simply outlines to get people into the mindset of what makes a good deck. Know when to break the rules comes with experience and playtesting.A typical control deck will want to allow an aggro deck to DFO first giving the control deck fresh problems to set up a block and camp a big problem. Since you run at a score disadvantage until this happens you usually want a big problem to bridge the gap until you can DFO for the win. Obviously if your control isnt strong enough to keep an aggro deck from scoring your big  point problem then you are probably going to lose quickly. A control deck that runs  point problems sounds more like a hybrid control than a full control which is often the case since perfect lockouts dont often occur in MLPCCG but I dont know your decklists so theres no telling.,MLPCCG,ctknwpl,1,t5_2y3vv

Its probably better in the long run to lock down problems with TMs so that would add either  or  AT. Which comes to  AT. Thats a lot of AT Im concerned that your deck doesnt have enough comeback factor assuming your opponent uses that same amount of AT to build a sizeable lead against you.Secondly Take Shelter is almost impossible for you to confront. You literally need the Crystal Fluttershy or a Forest Owl with  Ceremonial Headresses to confront the Yellow. On the other hand to get the Orange req youll need Cherry Jubilee with a Headress or Crystal AJ. Im pretty sure AJ is almost always going to be at the opponents Problem so thats pretty much out of the picture.

7746689,0,t3_4lclhj,Its absolutely true that one shouldnt be disrespectful to ones opponent not when they are in front of you and not when you are speaking behind their back. But one thing I dislike about most of these articles that implore higher respect towards opponents is that they tell you to Take a step back from competition. To me competition is the reason for playing. I like winning but most of all I like a challenge and I like to improve my play style whenever possible. Now imagine a school kid in the th grade who would like to join the th grade right now. The reason for that is that he wants to fail at something get back up on his feet and improve until he finally manages to pass the test slowly working his way up and eventually mastering everything that school has to master. That student is then send to the rd grade and forced to repeat the same old subjects over and over again. The skill level in that class is reduced for a good reason the other students would be understandibly frustrated if they were send to th grade and they probably dont have the ambitious mind set to want to join the th grade. So in effect that student from the th grade will sit in class bored and without opportunity to improve. It is obviously wrong to tell bad beat stories about those stupid idiotic rd graders. But just imagine how that th grade student feels when hes forced into the rd grade. Well thats how I often feel when I have to play against a casual player. It doesnt matter whether I lose or win the game just isnt any fun because it isnt a challenge. Thats not how I feel when playing against a new but ambitious player. I do love to play with someone who tries to improve a rd grader who wants to join the th or even just the th grade. I can teach them what I know and see them improve. But seeing players do the same mistakes all the time is just frustrating. Its all fine when the rd graders do their own thing while you are in your th grade but it becomes frustrating when you are frequently forced into the rd grade. ,MLPCCG,d3mqq8x,0,t5_2y3vv

This makes sense with the wording of the rule.What Im wondering is this when Cratus ability is triggered it creates an effect that allows you to chose a Critter here. Lets say at this particular moment the Critter in question isnt here yet. Before this effect is resolved a Critter is put into play here by another effect changing the state of the game. But the rule says the effect must be resolved using information at the moment of effect creation irrespective of the current state.
