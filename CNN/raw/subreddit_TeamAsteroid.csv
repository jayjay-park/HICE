9286419,0,t1_d8t1r41,Those weight exercises are simultaneously so good to start but also so frustrating because they slow down the movement on the scale even if you can begin to see changes in bodycomp. Hopefully the water retention goes away quickly and youll see the scale start to move! D,TeamAsteroid,d8t4csa,2,t5_3gveq
9298551,0,t3_57q8n1,so i did discover those little packets at the store for like  cents for a protein pack like I just ate one that was a whole bunch of roast beef low cal and tons of protein and actually helps with craving for food.i had been buying those p protein packs but  bucks each gets expensive and  cents is better than that...and I can walk again today since my back is better so yay although maybe not time to start over with weight lifting.,TeamAsteroid,d8unp4p,2,t5_3gveq
9315132,0,t1_d8vupi0,I hope you find a program that you really end up looking forward to and having fun with! I noticed that for me SLx wasnt really fun so it sometimes felt like a drag but I loved the subtle changes in stamina and strength and it made it all worth it! I am hoping to incorporate calisthenics along the way for the extra kick of fun. Before I took a break my lifts were in poundsSquats Bench Row OH press Deadlift ,TeamAsteroid,d8wrfj6,1,t5_3gveq

9651684,0,t1_da2q82s,Mine does this too sometimes and it usually results in me moving the scale around and holding different objects just to make sure its actually giving accurate results. Ive heard that some scales will do this if your weight is within a close enough rage a few days in a row. But I dont know if I believe that scales are that smart ,TeamAsteroid,da2rqjd,1,t5_3gveq
