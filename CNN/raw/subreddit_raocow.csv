888075,0,t1_ch57vh0,Im an advocate of PlatGenWohl which is an inplace replacement for SMBX. Basically meaning old SMBX levels will still work unless they relied heavily on undocumentedglitchy behaviour but new engine improvements can now happen. It uses SMBX ASMBXT AMBXT and LunaDLL as resources. I believe that while the default  characters will behave as per the main  of SMBX they wont use MarioLuigiToadPeachLink sprites by default but thats easy to override.,raocow,ch5878t,1,t5_2uh0w
