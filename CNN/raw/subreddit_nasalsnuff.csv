315346,0,t1_cfd062r,Well I always feel the nicotine when Im smoking Im not a regular smoker and I feel snus as well in fact general is a bit too strong for me.Can you reccomend me any stronger types of snuff? I really like mentholated ones.,nasalsnuff,cfdgdux,1,t5_2uip2
835271,0,t3_23ntm7,There are some good SPs out there with a bit of a kick. I find that different snuffs deliver the nicotine in different ways at least in my experience. Tom Buck for example could maybe be described as the high end of medium for nic content but for some reason I always feel a buzz even more so than with V Dark or T Quit.I havent tried Rustica but Ive heard good things. Its on the list for me for sure.,nasalsnuff,cgz811k,1,t5_2uip2

1350555,0,t1_cilktwq,I actually really enjoy the nic and menthol. The  in particular once I finally got it open is a delight. Its just the fine ones I gotta figure out. I also have a Toque order coming in. I hear those are a bit easier.,nasalsnuff,cill0kz,1,t5_2uip2
1648628,0,t3_2d7pcz,Welcome and thanks for writing to us uhedonaut ! We are not exactly flooded with posts here.I have many favourites but many tend to fall from favour after some time. Sometimes they come back. Ive noticed that the long time favourites tend to be plain snuffs where the natural good quality tobaccos and their processing play the main role. Id say my one absolute favourite and mainstay is Fribourg amp Treyers High Dry Toast. It was among the first snuffs I ordered from an UK tobacconists along with my regular order of pipe tobaccos. A bit more than ten years ago I think. I remember being underwhelmed by it at first and the couple of other scented snuffs Ive ordered stole my attention. The thing is I dont remember what the others were anymore.  HDT steadily climbed to as my absolute favourite and has stayed as one.The other toasts Ive tried havent come even close in the wonderful biscuity of the Digestive kind buttery nutty aroma that HDT has. Theres also the odd but nice whiff of ozone I often detect. I like the tall alu tin with all the old style writing on it. Even the EU health warning sort of melds in. It closes tight and keeps the snuff well. Due to the narrow opening a spoon is needed though. I usually use the spoon of a czech tool.Its dry like the name says and I dont have to worry it drying or going stale in the original tin or in a snuffbox. I recently found an old half full tin Id misplaced about eight or nine years ago and was surprised the aroma was still great. I think it had changed for the better even.Ive also found its the perfect snuff for public use. As long as you have a spoon or have decanted it in a snuffbox for easier pinching. The fine grind means it stays in your nose instead of rolling out as some coarser snuffs tend to do. The colour mostly coincides with my complexion so any mistaken powder doesnt show on my person as easily. Its dry and it wont stay on skin or clothes as some Indian oilbased snuffs can. Well as you can probably tell by all this prattle I really really like FampT HDT.,nasalsnuff,cjmz1ak,2,t5_2uip2
1649953,0,t3_2d7pcz,Jockey Club by Wilsons of Sharrow. Quite floral very nice. Everyone I know who tried it loved it.,nasalsnuff,cjn51w8,2,t5_2uip2
2701158,0,t3_2qz0a8,Despite snuffing for many years I still get uncomfortable snuffing in public. My advice is that if youre embarrassed about snuffing in your office try and be as openblatant as possible about what youre doing. Most likely the weird looks are just curiosity. Maybe offer your snuff around and get a discussion started.,nasalsnuff,cnb40n3,3,t5_2uip2
5729599,0,t1_cx5tl9n,tape up the tins with electrical tape. Theyll keep forever. Only pull out of the tin enough for one day and keep it in a separate container that you carry with you.,nasalsnuff,cx7b9cu,1,t5_2uip2
5915878,0,t1_cxv310n,Thanks for your reply! Im on mobile and didnt notice the wiki. Ill be sure to read that through. That said thanks for answering regarding the different moisture levels in regards to Toque brand. I certainly doubted a few of the tins dried out while others didnt but Im a complete noob so figured Id ask!Do you have any coarsemoist brands to recommend?,nasalsnuff,cxv3qdy,1,t5_2uip2
6228676,0,t3_3zylcd,I get this as well. I find if you make a conscious effort to stop smoking it makes the withdrawal bearable. Whenever I want a smoke I just take a snuff and set a timer for two minutes that I wont smoke for. After two minutes Im usually fine.,nasalsnuff,cyxmsr3,2,t5_2uip2

10443757,0,t3_5pgum6,This was my experience as well. Perhaps why I like medicated snuff so much retains its flavor forever. ,nasalsnuff,dcrvrdp,3,t5_2uip2
10447406,0,t1_dcsaapl,Ive tried Extra Crumbs of Comfort which is also supposed to be a menthol bomb though imo not as good at L. Ill order some Super Menthol next time.,nasalsnuff,dcsawv6,2,t5_2uip2
