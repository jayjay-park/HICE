6462616,0,t3_40sron,Hi fellow Southern Ontario env tech I heard about this company Quantec Geophys recently and it looks like a really exciting field position that could take you all over the globe. You have to be willing to work in the field for  to  days at a time and Im guessing get paid a ton of OT while doing it. I have worked in a field position for  years and have come to realize these companies really value field experience in any capacity over knowing the exact technicalities of the job they can teach you that so it sounds like you would be a good fit for it.,scienceforhire,czns1g4,1,t5_2srke
