630443,0,t1_cgbwdxc,Eventually Im going to make it to The Press room. Just not tonight. And I can honestly say it was pretty amazing at Pour. Everything I had was excellent. The Cornish game hen was fantastic. But really it was all great. I needed a meal out like that badly. Editing to add a little. The game hen was basically  pieces. Some breast meat and a leg. Now the breast was rolled with a slice of Italian salami in it. The leg was twice cooked and amazing. For me the carrot puree may have been the best part. It really did enhance everything else on the plate  mushrooms chard etc. ,lancaster,cgbxkb5,2,t5_2r3r9

City schools are OK if you live near Martin or Hamilton for elementary and if your kid is in the Honors program in the high school.Columbia is no good all around.  The rest of the districts are relatively similar in performance its just a matter of how much in taxes you want to pay.  Penn Manor Lampeter Strasburg Elizabethtown Manheim Eastern Lancaster Cocalico are all similar.  Warwick is a good balance of cheaper taxes and good performance.
