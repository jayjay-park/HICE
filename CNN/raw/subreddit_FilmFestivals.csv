6872414,0,t3_49rwod,Things have changed a lot over the years but I still think Chris Gores Ultimate Film Festival Guide is a good read. As is Christopher Hollands Film Festival secrets. Both are geared more towards telling film makers how to submit gear up etc for the festival. But reading from the p.o.v. of someone trying to do a film fest you might be able to see the type of things that film makers want in a fest.Outside of that id talk to film makers about the kind of things that are important to them. I know for me the best festivals are the ones that do a few things. . give me an opportunity to talk with other film makers in a nice environment. That means have a designated party or a area where attending film makers can get together and talk where the music isnt too loud there are times to party as well. This lets people meet new people and pitch ideas.. Be good at social media. Its up to a film maker to promote their film but if the movie is coming to your town at the very least its nice when the festival retweets reviews posts photos etc.. Have people from local news outlets already in place to review the film. Papers blogs etc. Just news people who desire to write about the movies at the festival and interview film makers. It helps. Have moderators for QampAs to get them started keep them going or cut them off as needed. Its hard for those first questions to get going sometimes but these are places where movies should be discussed. A room full of people who love movies.. promote screenings. Just get people in seats no matter what. Eyeballs on films is the most important thing to film makers.Id suggest starting small. Keep a blog and post about the things you are watching. Seek out indie films and short films. If you reach out to film makers to interview them youll get great response. I promise. They are dying for places to feature their movies.Start a one day or one evening screening in a small venue that hopefully you can get free Program it yourself and take suggestions. Grow from there.,FilmFestivals,d0vatc3,1,t5_2s4fm
