6843122,0,t3_495k4s,I would like BethesdaDWD to be cautious and test this element almost as much as the card balancing.What I mean is while cards are what give you the ability to execute a tactic or strategy the board is what molds and determines how creative or limited that strategy can be.There is a lot of assumption due to how it is dominating the digital CCG space that this game is going to similar to Hearthstone in the regards that it will have a single row of cards per player.Now while you do not actually see the spaces for it a Hearthstone board consists of  rows and  columns for a total of  spaces to fill  spaces for each players minions. You can also imagine the spaces below them to allow to place secrets.This is a simple design which many players can pick up on easy enough but it does limit board dynamics compared to if you also hadmultiple rows per playerfield cardsinteractive field elementscard movement on the board after playingshared card slots imagine if there are only  spaces total and either player can use the same spaces and a tactic would be to edge out the other player from using slotsNone of the above is necessarily a recommendation inandofitself.Dear BethesdaDWD my recommendation is to make sure to take into consideration the importance of board dichotomy in how it impacts the entire player experience. ,elderscrollslegends,d0rz1wb,1,t5_38oo4

The game mechanics for example arent exactly that clear to me.Going through the cards weve seen so far guard appears to be required to block if we go by MTG terms. So you can only protect yourself by either having a Creature with Guard or by killing any other creature in the lane right?Lethal seems to be deathtouch charge is haste i assume.Pilfer is something more interresting.It appears to be a mechanic that pops up in the agility i think? the green one stat cards does it mean the buff applies once an equipped enemy dies? or once that creature kills another creature?Also id like to give you a heads upPeople over at rteslore are already discussing some of the implications of the art weve been shown now.Looks like some fan art of Nirns geography has been elevated to official status,elderscrollslegends,d2c7okh,0,t5_38oo4

All of our weapons with the exception of Bone Bow are middle ground weapons that give an even spread of atkhp and of course we used Chieftains Banner which is the bread and butter of the deck ultimately allowing us to maintain board control and eventually go for a final push.

The OP has an excellent point  when you have full priced legendaries that you need  copies of on top of  cards decks its unreasonable that they would cost the same as unique legendaries.Im with you OP the crafting in this game is just as harsh as it is in Hearthstone. My suggestion is to put a one time payment on  or  packs so you have the basic stuff and dont find yourself crafting commonsrares which is horribly inefficient.

8779571,0,t3_50bxcd,What if Prophecy could only activate on the first player to have the rune broken? So say your opponent breaks your  health rune you can get a Prophecy. But if you then break their  health rune they cant.This would ofcourse only encourage counter racing even more. But in the first place i feel the racing problem has less to do with Prophecy and more with the strength of More health effects and perhaps flaws with the split lane and shadow lane design.To make racing worse More health cards could be nerfed or even something as crazy as if a minion doesnt do anything for x turns it can attack in both lanes.Not entirely fond of that second part but it would mean that having say a field lane advantage it would still be an advantage even when you arent hitting face with the card.,elderscrollslegends,d73476m,5,t5_38oo4

I play cards and decks that arent net decks cause I dont have enough of a collection to netdeck and I couldnt be happier. I also play HS and I have all the staple Classic legendaries and the meta defining ones from every expansion and sometimes I miss the days when I used to mess around with sub optimal deckscards.Sometimes not having every card is a good thing it forces you to be creative and you end up growing as a player and deck builder because of it.

8872656,0,t3_51ribm,Ill say you generally want to only craft legendaries or crucial epics first. Ive only crafted legendaries other than I had been playing for weeks and only had one thieves guild recruit. I eventually broke down and crafted two of them because they were absolutely core in providing some early game cycling. The deck is better from those crafts but I definitely waited as long as I could before the common craft. So I would stick with legendaries primarily and to a lesser extent epics but if you really want a common and have had bad luck getting it I cant say to not because I did. ,elderscrollslegends,d7ed9l0,1,t5_38oo4

8877515,0,t1_d7exlho,I think the game has to try harder to be anti aggro cause at the moment the only anti aggro elements are the runeprophecy mechanics. I had to turn my control scout deck into a midrange scout deck with a lower curve in order to run the chance of beating aggro Mage and aggro spellsword. The more health than opponent cards actually help aggro more than they help control. Since the game doesnt allow defenders the advantage of deciding trades I think it has to try that much harder to counter the aggro theme. Aggro is healthy for a game of course but not when its so prolific. Of course this is based on anecdotal evidence but who can disagree that TES like HS innately favors aggro when defenders dont have the advantage of choosing trades like in MTG?,elderscrollslegends,d7eyain,1,t5_38oo4

8912533,0,t3_529kyr,i consistently hit  win draft streaks normally no less than  wins and I have played limited MTG for a long time so i feel qualified to answer your question. My general strategy is very easy to follow. First of all try to play green any time you have the chance. The card cycling and removal options are really good. Green is the best color in constructed it makes sense that it carries over to arena. My personal favorite two color combination in arena is GreenWhite due to the amount of removal piercing javelin finish off fighters guild recruits etc. that you have access to. Next when you are drafting your deck try not to draft too many vanilla creatures. You want creatures that do things. Obviously you want to take bomb cards highly because they can flat out win the game. Removal should also be highly picked follow by anything that can get you a two for one. Two for ones are especially good in this game compared to other card games because of the rune mechanic. My favorite two for one is the  drop white creature that creates a copy of itself in the opposite lane when you summon it if you have more health than your opponent. Synergy is also something you should think about when drafting. Murkwater Witch plus finish off is a good example of a small synergy. Finally when playing I have found it beneficial to try to play a more controlling play style. People go to the shadow lane way too often when they should just attempt to dominate the field lane. The field lane is actually better for control decks because you get to control the trades and tempo and once you establish a presence there and are able to maintain it you can use your guards and removal to protect the shadow lane from your opponent gaining a huge presence.

9180958,0,t1_d8fq44m,Ive been  legend for the past several days. Have not faced a single nonaggro deck against other  legend players yet. I faced some mage control here and there but only when get matched against an rank er.  Assassins are something like  of the  legend meta right now according to my last  games.Funny enough my deck is a bit more midrange designed to beat extremely aggressive decks and more mage control would actually hurt me.,elderscrollslegends,d8fr5ce,3,t5_38oo4
9185946,0,t1_d8g9zzn,I agree with all of this. No question that adding Tazkad x Lightning Bolt and as many Moonlight Werebat as you can fit will help your winrate.        I went  last season against a player named Airewyn who got to at least rank  with a BlueGreen Dres Tormentor shackle deck. I know the deck ran Giant Snake to shackle a whole lane since I got wrecked by it. Would run x or x since its kind of weak without Dres in play.        As for what to take out you dont need Shadow Shift. Card draw is nice but you have to have a creature in play that you want to shift. Makes it situational. I realize you have Crystal Tower Crafter in it so can run x or x instead of x if you want.       Cruel Firebloom is a good card but I wouldnt run x without Balmora Spymaster or Goblin Skulk. Would run x here.             I would remove Arrow in the Knee since its very weak without Dres in play. Running Crafter isnt enough to force you into a very high spell count. You still need creatures to win.        ,elderscrollslegends,d8gdw8e,2,t5_38oo4

9202227,0,t1_d8i7z12,It only takes one loss to get into the serpent if you just got out of it and only  wins to get out if youre at the very bottom. If youre already  stars into a rank youre not going to go back to the serpent for a loss. I understand that youre frustrated but misrepresenting the actual numbers like this helps nobody.It doesnt matter if you have  or  in terms of collection stats if youre not properly utilizing that collection then youre not going to get anywhere.  consecutive losses makes me think that you need to rework your deck or rework your strategy. Consider looking up some net decks look at what cards theyre playing why theyre playing them see if you can come up with something after getting a few ideas as its usually easier to play a deck you created rather than net decking someone elses deck.,elderscrollslegends,d8ig7od,3,t5_38oo4
9209692,0,t3_56h7t8,When I first started playing I thought it was amazing but the RNG is too ridiculous. Turn  I cant afford to put weak stats on the board and I feel like if Im lucky Ill roll a Tiger but if Im playing willpower Id be more comfortable just playing Tiger instead to guarantee good stats and a guard effect. Its an ok card but not consistent enough or worth it to be good. If more strong beasts get added then its possible it can be played more.,elderscrollslegends,d8jeaso,1,t5_38oo4
9216915,0,t3_56h7t8,One of the biggest examples of bad RNG in the game. Requires no setup or build around just a straight up attempt to roll high. Have lost several arena games due to this summoning a Swamp Leviathan which always feels like complete bs of course.I think theres probably a good chance this could catch on in constructed at some point which could create a problem with RNG deciding games. Its a gamble but one that usually pays off. Always two bodies and the  Spriggan is worth around . So if you pull at least a  drop body its worth it.Looking through the card list I count  possible pulls so the odds of getting a good above curve result Swamp Leviathan Snowy Sabre Cat Cliff Racer Pit Lion Tusked Bristleback Giant Snake Territorial Viper or Senche Tiger is  or  while the chances of getting a bad result Afflicted Alit Mudcrab Scuttler Lurking Crocodile Ravenous Crocodile is  or . The other  Barded Guar Blighted Alit Feasting Vulture Frostbite Spider Giant Bat are fair results at  or  again.TLDR  chance of a good pull  chance of a fair pull  chance of a bad pullSo roughly a  chance of it being a good play with a high chance of it being a very strong play. Even if it only pulls a  thats  worth of stats for  mana not really terrible even with the low roll. There are only  results that are truly bad Mudcrab Scuttler and Afflicted Alit.I think people will catch on that its pretty damn strong at some point at which time the RNG and antigreen turbulence will intensify. The only reason it hasnt caught on in constructed yet is that it doesnt really play into current popular green archetypes such as Archer Prophecy Assassin or Scout ramp. In a more general midrange green deck it could become a go to  drop as some of those results can straight up win you a game.I hope they change it to a  or  drop that puts the animal into your hand like a bigger High Rock Summoner. Would keep the theme intact and be just fine.Edit the fact that this cant pull wolves makes no sense.,elderscrollslegends,d8kb8s1,3,t5_38oo4

9443556,0,t3_5a1vs3,Just like any any Last Gasp creature Balmora Spymaster is an excellent target for cards that sacrifice creatures. This card is bad if you cant dependably have him die. Buffing him so he can attack is a solution but generally isnt that great of a solution because the only reason for his existence is to die.The longer the game goes on the more random his effect which is bad in some cases because he can become Odavhiing or a Septim Guardsmen. Heck I think he can actually he can actually summon another Balmora Spymaster. I both like and dislike this card because if you dont have the cards to have it be killed its useless and is a burden. But at the same time whenever Ive used him Ive always gotten something I needed nothing spectacular but useful. A guard that somehow blocked lethal damage a charge that allowed me to kill an important target one time it became a Priest of the Moons and again saved me from lethal by two health and allowed me to win. Moments like this make it worth it but its not always consistent.Edit Also it makes the opponent hesitate before using AOE in the lane where this guy exists.,elderscrollslegends,d9d1ddy,2,t5_38oo4

9447373,0,t3_5a3y8q,Interesting change!I would say the main issue is the fact that prophecy cards have been designed and powered around the current mechanics and simply making this the standard would break a lot of cards.If they do go with this change they would have to redesign most of the prophecy cards in the set.The other problem with this mechanic is how much it favors control more than the current system already does.  Instead of requiring the top card to be prophecy it simply requires any card in your hand to have it.  Cards like firestorm in its current state would utterly destroy any aggressive decks chance of winning.  The chances to play cards for free therefore goes up.The main point of prophecy is to allow control decks to comeback against face decks and give some chance when you get a bad draw.  Under the current iteration its unfortunate that non agrovscontrol match ups end up seeming more luck based and I believe that should be the focus when deciding on a fix.This change I feel benefits control much more than it already benefits from the rune system and would hurt agros chances of competing dramatically.  Often in Agro vs control the control player isnt looking for cards  they have all the cards and not enough mana to play them all.  While this is due to the current rune draws its also due to the types of cards they play and the lack of  drops.My opinion is that they need to be more careful with the prophecies they design.  Prophecies shouldBe Bad on curveHave the potential to save you from lethalNot be completely game winning if played for free earlyBe much more defensivecomeback oriented and never aggressively statdAs long as they follow these I feel like prophecies will receive less grief and be seen as strong antiagro cards as they are designed to be.  ,elderscrollslegends,d9dirk5,8,t5_38oo4

That said I would always advise caution on  Legend OMG posts as a way of judging general meta viability especially earlyseason posts since those are essentially just people rushing a bunch of games early. Realistically Control Warrior and Archer are not top tier but basically any control deck can be viable if you have both a solid stalling strategy and a reliable win condition. The Dremora satisfies the latter point so long as you can reliably keep something big on the table ahead of time to buff.All of that said if youre focused on red and dont have a lot of cards yet its almost certainly the wrong one to craft over things like Blood Dragon or Vigilant Giant or even x Burn amp Pillage or other key epics.,elderscrollslegends,d9klml4,6,t5_38oo4

9658544,0,t3_5db6s1,I agree with several others that theres not much sense to BML in this deck its a heavily controlfocused card that has its best value when played at very high magicka ie  to use the spell immediately. If you want a finisher Supreme Atromancer as many have pointed out is far better for your particular deck tempo.Similarly Ice Storm is usually played in wards on top of the creatures that benefit from it. I dont see why youd make a ward deck and not run it  Shornhelm especially as Breton is... arguably pretty bad without it.

Often people dislike things and everyone dog piles that person and claims the game is amazing perfect or fine and bark at the person until they give up. Its the kind of thing that gets balanced out in big communities where a more diverse group of opinions are shared but in a small community its just toxic as the community will be more likely to sheep towards the few streamersvideo makers that they can find and blindly accept their word because they are threatened when people speak ill towards the game because they dont want it to fail.This is a bad way for the community to go.

Your stats alone arent large enough to be statistically significant for the rank as a whole especially since whowhat you play is often going to be influenced by the exact hour youre playing at and your personal MMR. Anyway I think the deck is prevelent enough to be a concern but were also right about to get a whole new set of cards and presumably some meta shift so its a little silly to argue to death. I do still think Hist Grove needs to be on the radar for changes simply because it promotes a very simplistic and easily dominant style that can crowd other decks out of the meta ie control not based around it or even slower midrange decks that just cant deal with  stall as a winning strategy.,elderscrollslegends,db7a8f2,1,t5_38oo4

10057124,0,t1_dbi45nb,gt Of course it matters what cards your opponent might have in their hand. If you thinkknow your opponent has a javelin or similar effect or silence you dont want to go allin on one big creature. If you think your opponent has an ice storm you dont want to play a bunch of lt hp stuff that just dies to it and want to try to keep your guys above .What if your opponent   plays wabbajack and turns your next three creatures into sweet rolls which is far better late game than javelin plays murkwater witch and finish off Isnt playing blue or yellow plays a firebrand with deadric dagger plays cloudrest illusionist and not only doesnt trade creatures but has an additional beatstick on the board Shadowfens your late game creature and then ignores it and goes face doest play javelin at all I do this because so many people expect it they screw themselves trying to play around a card I dont use what if your opponent doesnt have a javelin in hand but top deck one or procs one when you go face next turn?Are you next going to tell me not to go up against a Sicilian when death is on the line?There are so many permutations of what COULD happen that it is impossible to play contingency for all of them in a  card deck. The closest accurate guess you can make is do they have a hand to counter my play or do they not and which side of the fence you are going to fall on. This is why the best strategy for late game is to not play late game.......Its a gordian knot scenario. Which brings me to my next point....gt I have no idea what this even means or what youre trying to say. What are these s and s? As mentioned in my last point you cannot accurately guess what the other person has in their hand. They MAY have it in their deck but that definitely doesnt mean they are holding it if their deck even includes it to begin with see my comment about not using javelins The only thing you can guess is if they have an optimal cardhand for this turn reguardless of what is being played. Considering that there are only four possibilities   neither of you have an optimal hand this turn   your opponent has an optimal hand and you do not   you have an optimal hand and your opponent does not   you both have an optimal handYou having  creatures or not doesnt matter because its equally likely he is sitting on answers for each of those creatures or not. Likewise he could have an answer for two creatures but you have no creatures in hand or vise versa.gt  but I can tell you that the meta is definitely not forced down to the fewest turns possible right nowIt is getting there. Aggro is becoming more and more prevalent. Control was the long game thats toast due to hist grove so now control is a latemid game and in response battle mage is a quicker midgame and aggro is climbing the ranks higher every season. The main reason aggro isnt dominant is because people are incorrectly afraid of prophecy.gt  In the second scenario that play isnt at all impossible to deal with as another control deck.There is no way to control it. You play Miraak swipe the other players biggest creature being that end game creatureslegends start in the  cost you are almost certainly going to be swiping an end game creature or something on par with preserver of the root. You then close call miraak back to your hand. You can conter the stolen creature but miraak is out of reach. And you can keep doing this as long as you have close calls foresworn guides and brilliant experiments. Your opponent has two options stop playing creatures or play creatures and then spend control getting rid of them. Its a constant two for one trade meanwhile the miraak player is still sitting on his creatures and control waiting for you to run out of gas.gt If you can keep pressure on your opponent while holding back your best creatures hes eventually forced to Miraak just to take the pressure off himself.Its not like miraak is going to be the only creature they have. If you play late game shit theyll do it as well. Sure you can control your own creatures off the board but now you are building a deck to defeat itself while the close calls and like cards retain their value regardless of the situation.,elderscrollslegends,dbiguke,-2,t5_38oo4

10102982,0,t3_5kdx5r,. Beta.  Theres a lot of people who dislike betas and wont play a game until it goes live.  Theres a stigma about beta builds that the game is unfinished and might go through major changes still.  When it comes to a competitive card game thats a pretty big deal.  . Marketing.  Those who mentioned steam bring up a great point.  You have other Bethesda titles over there but TESL is not.  This wouldnt save TESL but it definitely actively hurts the game.  Especially since the bulk of your PC fan base buys your products from there.. Mobile.  This one is obvious.  The mass appeal of these games comes from the fact that they can be pick up and played at any time.  The play at home PC market is only a fraction of your player base since there is just a TON of high quality competition in that area.   In terms of mobile gaming though...TESL would stand out among the best and have a much greater appeal..  Bethesda is not Blizzard.   Part of the problem could simply be out of their hands.  HS could be WoW with every other competitor regardless of quality just being the perceived wow clone thatll never be able to compete to the original.  Lets face it Blizzard has been a mulitplayer Juggernaut for decades and Bethesda is known for buggy heavily modded single player experience that can absorb you for s or s of hours.   As popular as The Elder Scrolls is as an IP it doesnt necessarily translate to immediate popularity in a multiplayer card game since thats a departure from what Bethesda is known for.   HS compliments what Blizzard excels at as a company and so it easily welcomes its existing fan base. ,elderscrollslegends,dbofiu7,1,t5_38oo4

10189908,0,t3_5lwfj9,gthow friendly is this game in terms of pay to win? Its pretty similar to Hearthstone. Its much more generous with rewards but decks are larger  vs.  and you generally need higher rarity cards theres more epics than rares and you can have  copies of many of the legendaries in your decks.Overall it feels better than Hearthstone. Arena gives you a lot more cards and shards dust with up to  packs for going max wins . The constructed rewards are really great since every  wins you get a free card and if youre really lucky it can be a legendary or even a pack. On top of that you get  gold while I think Hearthstone just gives you a flat  gold. You also get small amounts of shards for playing against the AI so you can even grind while watching TV or a stream or whatever. Packs feel a bit more generous too and it seems related to a friendlier pity timer system.So overall this game showers you with a lot more stuff for playing but decks are more expensive in general compared to Hearthstone. Whats nice about this game though is that the classes you play are formed by combining two different colors. Not only does that give a single card potentially  different purposes but you can build your collection towards multiple different classes at the same time. Compare this to Hearthstone where youre basically forced into building into just a Hunter deck or a Warrior deck or whatever.gtalso how good is the gameplay compared to hearthstone? Is time commitment similar to hearthstone?The pacing of games is pretty similar to Hearthstone. Getting to legendary is currently much faster especially since you cant derank and you dont fall back nearly as many ranks at the end of a season. If you finish at rank  at least you start again at rank  which is a lot better than starting at rank  or whatever in Hearthstone. I went from rank  to legend last season with very little play time.Concerning gameplay youre going to get a lot of biased opinions here since most of us left Hearthstone because we felt this game was better.Personally I feel like Direwolf took the base mechanics of Hearthstone which were already great improved the things that were bad about Hearthstone and then added some extra mechanics on top of everything to make games feel more meaningful and complex. The presentation may be lacking a bit but the gameplay is really really solid.We still get lots of complaints about how Deck X is ruining the game but honestly this games meta has been deeper and more fluid than really any time in Hearthstone and I played from open beta.Thats really the main thing that impresses me the most. Theyve really nailed the balance and lots of different decks and strategies are viable. Every month they add a new card as well as retune nerfing and buffing certain cards and these patches have had a significant and mostly positive impact on the meta. You might be interested in checking out each of the past  Between the Lanes Meta Snapshots to see just how much decks rise and fall each month.,elderscrollslegends,dbz2zj0,5,t5_38oo4

Then coupled with  Necromancers Amulets to make your tokens and guards suicide heal you...  And if you put only Disciple of Namiras in the  slot you can usually get two out in a lane at a single time on Altar turn . That gives you two cards for every one you sacrifice so you can just mill through lowcost cards like crazy by stacking them on top of eachother in a full lane.

10291672,0,t1_dcalwsw,I dont see how thats a problem.  Allowing a deck with only  cards for lifegain to comeback with a  drain seems unrealistic.  When deciding for lifegain cards Night Talon Lord was never considered for his drain alone because snaketooth necklace could give that to any of your lategame creatures instead.The versatility of giving drain to something is far to strong to have on  card and having it permanent.  Cards with drain on them can be stated accordingly giving it to any creature cannot.  Hopefully this opens people up to running decks which are more devoted to lifegain rather than have ramp scout be the best lifegain deck anyway. ,elderscrollslegends,dcam7pe,2,t5_38oo4
10293330,0,t1_dcapgy1,No ramp scout is gone and spellsword will reconsider its addition. And also  you answered yes but the real answer is no. Even though the deck is now useless I can only soultrap  cards of the entire deck.They have already admitted that its fair to allow the fullcost dusting of nerfednowuseless cards but did not broach the subject of all the cards built around a single card which is exactly this  scenario. Without histgrove ramp scout is dead and although you dont seem realize the true impact of this nerf as somebody that played scout ramp from day  of hist groves release hist grove is dead.Sure it will win some games now and then it will probably even manage to activate hist grove once in awhile but it is now removed from the meta as anything other than a memory.,elderscrollslegends,dcaszaf,-1,t5_38oo4

10446846,0,t1_dcs4mul,. Good to know. Changing it to Blue is simply a theme thing for me. BlueIntelligence is typically home to being clever and recycling a stronger item for two cheaper items seems clever to me.. Im happy to see that you agreed with me. Most Red cards tend to have high attack with low health so I thought it would be good for both balance and theme..  costs just seems better especially since your opponent knows what the card is.. So basically what happens to one happens to the other? Or at least in most cases. Like if I attacked one would the other be damaged too?. It would totally work with the first card because it guarantees the condition to be met. I dont think it matters how many cards on top the original is looking for.. If they ever change the how Prophecies work than maybe the card would be fine depending on what you gave Prophecy. An Odavhiing a few turns before hitting  Magicka is what Im worried about.. Thats fair. If you dont mind changing the card a bit I would recommend it a regular Legendary  Cost  with a Summon effect reading The cost of your next action is split between your Magicka and Health. The effect will carry over until you cast an action and there would be unread rulesYou cant die from the effect takes more Health if the cost is odd etc. because players like figuring things out.

11137752,0,t1_detvonl,If you win a game hitting  prophecies and them not hitting an equal number of your own a point youre glossing over it means your deck well positioned against the other deck or the match is won already. This happens in games against Proph BM because the deck is literally  prophecies and has Fate Weavers on top of that. Obviously there are decks that can beat proph BM and obviously youre still going to trigger all their prophecies even when you win.However in aggro  midrange vs aggro  midrange games prophecies totally determine the game if they happen in part because these decks have lower totals of these cards so the variance is higher and the ability to meaningfully play against them is lower not attacking because of a  chance of a prophecy is almost always incorrect especially if your life totals are close. I seriously doubt youre frequently winning matchups like this with a  prophecy gap let alone . You may win some but again those are probably extreme matchups badgod draws etc.gtThat time you lost to a last prophecy harpy ... If you didnt have a choice the opposing player put you in that position they played well.I didnt have a choice it was a close game and any other prophecy but the harpy wouldnt have stopped me. They played well I played well. The prophecy determined the game. This is not a hard concept to grasp and the fact that you keep attacking the strawman of skill not being a factor  omg if you cant handle prophecies git gud  play this other deck means youre continuing to misrepresent my initial post.  You can play around some prophecies. But many you cant. Thats really all there is to it. ,elderscrollslegends,deugbge,1,t5_38oo4

But its a solid midrange deck for early rank at the least with the versatility to switch between control and also aggro with all the additional reach the deck can provide.Its also very cheap and only requires core set.

11644085,0,t3_665vtf,Welcome!First q you pretty much understand it already. You occasionally get em in packs and are worth more. My advice to a noob unless you really like the way it looks or its your favorite card just scrap it. Itll help you build a playable collection faster.Second q this game is pretty chill with moneygrabbing. I preordered db so idk how much it costs now but in total its  in game gold. If you end up liking the game id pay the twenty. You get a lot of cool cards i would recommend it. As for the other collection the madhouse collection it costs  for ten new cards. Most of these are combo pieces and are meh in most decks but staples in others. It costs  irl.Hope this helps!,elderscrollslegends,dgfvcsf,2,t5_38oo4
