10140663,0,t3_5kloq7,I hear you and as someone that was raised by a skitzophrenic single mother I have a lot of the same kinds of feelings and I have trouble accepting someone love me. I was lucky enough to be put in a good foster home but nothing will get my early years back. I may always have times I feel like a mistakelike I dont belongthat Im worthless no matter how many people say otherwise. Anyway this is not about me. I hope you can see yourself as someone that can be loved. Even if you dont know them yet there is someone out there that loves you and would never blow you off. I wish I could do more than that but I would be so happy to talk with you anytime. Please be well. PM me anytime. I want to help. ,ShowMeThePickles,dbtbzm9,2,t5_3i1h0
