And America hasnt been doing so great lately....I worry the American people dont understand the complex ecosystem that exists between the government the economy and their personal lives. And that a government that governs least governs best. Rand gets it. We as his supporters need to take it upon ourselves to ask the right questions using the Socratic method to voters to help them deduce what is in their best interest  limited government limited spending more personal freedoms.If I were in a room and said I want to eat! lets go to KFC.Only those that understood they were hungry too would follow.But if I say Im going to eat! Have you not eaten? Do you want to starve?When they ask themselves that question they will be compelled to follow. We need to give them a personal charge to do what is in their best interest to vote and vote for Rand.Ill put my soapbox away for now but it wont be out of reach. ,StandwithRand,cz7z4gk,3,t5_389of

If only there was a presidential candidate who had a plan to make my loans tax deductible and force college tuition costs down via the free market...,StandwithRand,cz84kqz,5,t5_389of

That also seems like it would require an additional piece of paperwork and another level of bureaucracy to manage it. ,StandwithRand,cz99n32,1,t5_389of
