9933610,0,t3_5hos7x,It needs some tweaks to the spawn points I think. If you get on the top tower of the enemys base and start killing them its really easy to pick people off as they spawn unless they just start teleporting blindly right as they spawn. I agree with uCMDRhepburnd that its too easycheap to get down from the tower quickly. The teleport is limited in distance horizontally I see no reason it shouldnt be limited vertically as well.Its also really bad for CTF matches to the point where I feel like AG should just remove CTF as a game mode on that map. Unless there are tweaks made to CTF gameplay e.g. slowing down the flag carriers teleporting anyway.,RecRoom,db2dhvn,2,t5_3a2b2
10004009,0,t1_dbbhw3q,I think the video of dasMEHDI is a good example... that was apparently his first ever experience with VR. When he got into an uncomfortable situation his only option was to take off the headset and quit the game.That is not a good outcome.So the goal of the panic button is to put you back in control and give you time to decide what you want to do without feeling pressured.You might decide that you still want to quit but at least its a choice made rationally not a choice forced by an unpleasant situation that you just want to make it stop.,RecRoom,dbbjuhj,9,t5_3a2b2
10028716,0,t3_5j8k37,I experienced this the other night as well after trying RecRoom with RiftTouch then switching back to my Vive. I figured that had something to do with it but after restarting the game and SteamVR it was fine and hasnt happened again since.,RecRoom,dberpiy,1,t5_3a2b2

10429656,0,t1_dcq4j3z,I found them in another game and they didnt realize it was me. I ended up beating them and afterwards they asked everyone to vote kick me again... I also got vote kick notifications for everyone on my team towards the end of the game from them. They are abusing the vote kick system.,RecRoom,dcq9qzi,2,t5_3a2b2
10636087,0,t1_ddcvjfq,I have to disagree here. You need to view the shield the way you view a gun. You cant just sit there and expect to block shots. You need to see it the way you see a gun  Aim where you want to block. ,RecRoom,ddd14gm,2,t5_3a2b2

10866335,0,t1_de06966,Nah. Let me get this straight in this game consistency is key. The top players play the game pretty much EVERY DAY for a couple of hours each time. As long as you play youll get points it doesnt matter if you had a bad round if you got one kill that goes on the leaderboard. With the current distribution of casuals and the more crazy players the majority of points come from matches against opponents not quite on your own level. You can easily net  hits in a single evening if you really wanted to. The question is how bad do you want it? Bad enough to grind for it? If you do youll get there.,RecRoom,de0sa50,2,t5_3a2b2
10892944,0,t1_ddyrtr0,Thank you for reporting this. It should be fixed with todays update.,RecRoom,de3j340,2,t5_3a2b2
10909384,0,t3_5vkyg7,I just beat quest twice a few minutes ago and overall Im pretty happy with the update. It forced a rethink of some strategies and required players to be a little more mobile. I like that the red guys are more of a threat now.As someone else mentioned the Axe minibosses hitting you through the floor in the final boss room is a little lame. Im not sure how you can fix that though. Make the catwalk a little higher? force the knights to carry the axes with the points down when under them? A rule like that may impact the knight in that narrow hallway too. Simply having them not protrude through could potentially work although it may look odd at the right angle.Im not sure swords needed more damage. Its hard enough to get close to an enemy with them so Id rather get the chance to take two swings instead of one when I do get closer. Would it be possible to scale the damage to the power of the swing? Also throwing swords! If I hurl my sword at someone Id like to see it do damage if the sharp end hits!On that note the throwing mechanics do seem more consistent although I didnt play with them too much. Flipping my crossbow felt pretty great.Im gonna have to check out that crucial system update. Ive been bouncing ping pong balls since the last update... any chance the game could tally consecutive hits? I lost count after  but having a leaderboard for that would be awesome. I think I did most of those alternating sides of the paddle too!,RecRoom,de584vq,1,t5_3a2b2

11808594,0,t1_dgyh3t1,I disagree that nonteleport movement would result in strictly sprayandpray gameplay SAP. SAP is indicative in all types of FPS but rarely ever works in higher level gameplay. With all FPS it always boils down to anticipating your opponents movement knowing the map and hitting your opponent before they hit you. To consistently accomplish the third point youll have to hit them in the least amount of shots thus valuing accuracy over luck. This is especially true for game types where its onehit kills like paintball.I understand that VR is a different beast but that doesnt mean it would stray that much from D FPS. It really boils down to how fast the movement actually is. Nothing as outrageously fast as twitchshooters like Overwatch. I believe Onward has found a pretty good speed.Overall I dont disagree that changing the locomotion will change the priorities. With teleport you prioritize more ducking and dodging in the real world as well as anticipating your opponents next teleport and reacting. I believe with armswinging the ducking and dodging would still be there except now when you engage an opponent you wont have the option to teleport out of the way but have to pick a spot and stand your ground. Personally I would prefer the teleport gameplay but I wouldnt be able to say which is necessarily better in terms of balance.,RecRoom,dgyjmto,1,t5_3a2b2
