2762910,0,t1_cni2vo8,So... Rickey Henderson can and will turn on being Rickey Henderson when it suits Rickey Henderson but also can and will turn off being Rickey Henderson when Rickey Henderson can perceive that it suits Rickey Henderson to NOT be Rickey Henderson to the fullest extent that Rickey Henderson can be?Suddenly it clicks!

Sockalexis played professional baseball in the National League for three seasons spending his entire career  as an outfielder for the Cleveland SpidersgtA Native American from the Penobscot tribe Sockalexis is often identified as the first person of Native American ancestry to play in Major League Baseball though many conflicting reports exist. In some cases Jim Toy a catcher in the early American Association is identified as the first person with Native American ancestry to play major league baseball.  Author Ed Rice has disputed this having found a death certificate for Toy stating his race as Caucasian although birth records of the time are notoriously inaccurate. Also Chief Yellow Horse who played in the early s is noted as the first fullblooded American Indian to have played in the major leagues. gtgtImage iInteresting Joe Visner | Jim Toy baseball | Chief Wahoo |  in baseball Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcrpaaz oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecrpaaz.

4201494,0,t3_38zqwy,The Cincinnati Base Ball Club formed in  and fielded competitive teams in the National Association of Base Ball Players NABBP  a time of a transition that ambitious Cincinnati Ohio businessmen and Englishborn ballplayer Harry Wright shaped as much as anyone. Major League Baseball recognized those events officially by sponsoring a centennial of professional baseball in .Thanks partly to their onfield success and the continental scope of their tours the Red Stockings established styles in team uniforms and team nicknames that have some currency even in the st century. They also established a particular color red as the color of Cincinnati and they provide the ultimate origin for the use of Red Sox in Boston.This team was   and thus the only undefeated professional team in history.This is not the modern Cincinnati Reds.  Half the team became the Washington Olympics which disappeared. The other half became the Boston Red Stockings which then eventually became the Boston Braves and todays Atlanta Braves.  So one could say the Atlanta Braves are the oldest team in baseball.,ClassicBaseball,crz5v8r,3,t5_2yab6

5140402,0,t3_3ldso6,Weve talked about Herman and Hartnett before but this is the first time for Mr Lindstrom nows about a perfect time to pop his rClassicBaseball cherry.  Ive known the name for a while known hes a HOFer and that was about it always assumed he was one of the Frisch inductees but I was wrong Lindstrom was inducted in  soon after the debacle when the Veterans Committee was probably careful under public scrutiny so hes legit.Oh my   hits in  . and again in  . the man was a beast when he was on!  To top it off Freddie was also one of the finest defensive rd basemen of his era would have won at least three Gold Gloves if they existed back then no easy feat when one of your contemporaries is Pie Traynor of the Pirates.However Lindstroms potentially huge prime was curtailed by injuries  a broken leg in  Giants a broken finger in  Pirates and a knee injury in  Cubs put him on the bench for long stretches of time.  The final straw was a collision with fellow Dodger infielder in  after which Freddie called it quits.  At the age of !Lindstrom compiled  hits with a . BA averaging  Hits  Runs and  RBIs in a game season so regardless of his short career and . WAR his induction into Cooperstown is a honorable one like Sandy Koufax.
