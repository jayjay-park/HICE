4614018,0,t1_ct8xa9n,Im not sure how far away youre willing to go for hiking camping and falls but the densest area for waterfalls is out in the Brevard NC area about  hour drive from Winston in the Pisgah National Forest. It is well worth the drive!The last four pages of this waterfall guide cover some of the major ones for that area. We camp in this area every year and I highly recommend checking out Gorges State Park Turtleback Rainbow Hidden Falls Dupont State Forest Hooker Triple and High falls and Courthouse Falls on that map.

Very long walk up. Guy at the bottom used to own a snow mobile and pulled us up on a rope.
