7575718,0,t3_4iyw9v,Absolutely yes! You will give more high fives in this one weekend than you have given in your entire life up until now. Getting older shouldnt matter LiB tends to have an older crowd anyway so there will be a pretty substantial amount of  there. Go and have a good time Im sure youll make some great friends and take home awesome memories because of it. ,LightningInABottle,d33bm6w,2,t5_2xlua

10320194,0,t3_5nld0l,Didnt really look like the lake was full that was water running down to the southern end of the lake.I read somewhere theyre out of singledigit capacity as of Jan  so theyre definitely positively trending but nowhere near the level that would be significant to the northern end of the lake where LIB is... thats gonna take years of storms like this and proper water management I think a major factor has also been diversion of the water to Nacimiento to keep those levels high. EDIT Here are the current stats on both lakes,LightningInABottle,dcdumt4,5,t5_2xlua

10546884,0,t3_5qsuwc,I got super lucky last year. I left at like  or  am but I was at high grounds camp. I noticed people off roading and driving way up on the side of the hill. Followed them all and exited past the main entrance gate. Thought I was going to get in trouble or something but was just gunna play it off like I didnt know what I was doing. I doubt that will be the case this year. Probably will close off the road further up and the gate. I got out in less that  minsAnyone else do this?? ,LightningInABottle,dd3lvbf,2,t5_2xlua
10581856,0,t1_dcwj0qt,Unlike Coachella a car camping pass is not a necessity for LiB. If you dont get one you just have to lug all your crap from the parking area to your campsite. Not fun but doable.,LightningInABottle,dd7fqh3,1,t5_2xlua
10744671,0,t1_dd39v3a,finally got around to replying! I put Lucidity last because . it seems super focused on the transformationalspiritualworkshop stuff compared to the others most evident by the . lack of lineup until this week which reminded me to come here and reply. The lineup looks pretty good but I was definitely going to rank it last until I knew it. And Im not super into the workshops and spiritual stuff though Im glad Lucidity is a strong venue for others to experience that. Still stand by that order at this point. The Symbiosis lineup so far is BONKERS,LightningInABottle,ddo8c6q,1,t5_2xlua
