6436674,0,t3_43fl2e,Agreed with what others are saying here as well.  If you want to include the castor oil with the jojoba and almond oil make sure its a small percentage of the total mixture.  Like uruffian said it will feel pretty unpleasant to have the heavier oil in the beard if theres too much.,beardoil,czl39hb,1,t5_32a9p
6862771,0,t3_49qq97,If youre looking for a fresh citrusy smell that stays around a bit longer try mixing elemi litsea cubeba and mentha arvensis . The smell is similar to lemon drops or lemon balm.I use it for my soap and while the citrusy smell tends to fade a little after several weeks it will still smell fresh a bit more like elemi. Its one of my favorite scents.For my beard oil however I prefer a more woodsy scent. Cedarwood eucalyptus pine fir and maybe sandalwood are generally good choices. Cedarwood in my experience has a rather weak smell so I use lots of it while eucalyptus can be pretty overwhelming if you use too much.,beardoil,d0u7e5l,2,t5_32a9p

9493261,0,t3_5ats3p,If you only need a few you should be able to find some on Amazon at a decent price especially with prime. If I remember correctly Square bottles are a little more expensive and may require a little more internet browsing,beardoil,d9j8xc4,1,t5_32a9p

You will certainly run out of money before product using them.  But if you figure out anything good. Help a Brother out and contact me at www.KeystoneBeardCompany.com ,beardoil,dbqhixs,1,t5_32a9p
