6920187,0,t3_4ahfab,Sorry to hear about your loss. I watched a short documentary about collies and they are respectable intelligent and loyal towards their owners. Through growing up and watching close ones pass on I learned that its important to capture the moment using a camerasmartphone so later on when you decide to take a stroll down memory lane it will be very vivid with a photographic memory. remember to back up photos! ,IDmydog,d10q6d4,1,t5_319c0

7860671,0,t3_4mzg6h,Wow Im sorry to break it to you OP but that looks like a total mutt. Shes got so much going on that Id be hard pressed to pin down anything! Shes unique As it is I can see traces of corgi in her body shape and forehead mainly pic  where shes giving the paw. I can see the spitz that uCattack mentioned in the tail and ears. I see maybe some hound in the long snout and large paws. Maybe a touch of rough collie in her head profile pic . Total jumble!Best of luck with your new friend! D,IDmydog,d3zlzda,1,t5_319c0
