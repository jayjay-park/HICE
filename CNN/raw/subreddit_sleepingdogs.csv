2697711,0,t1_cnanny0,Oh I did the DLCs .. I had bought the definitive.  So I beat all the main stuff and DLC and did the Zodiac a couple times lol.  Im still going to  it but the majority of everything is DONE.  I had all the cop and triad stuff done before I went at scumbag smiles.  I do have some races left though .. but Im gonna play some snioper stuff before I go back to it.,sleepingdogs,cnapk12,2,t5_2u5qo
3206407,0,t1_coctpkc,Really? I got the Standard version for free with a Never Settle bundle then picked up the Definitive Edition during a Steam sale for cheap. Granted I have a powerful system but the DefEd is pretty much a solid fps at p and highest possible in game settings. I was debating about whether to up the AA in the CCC since I can tell my X isnt maxed out by it. ,sleepingdogs,coucd0n,1,t5_2u5qo

10997548,0,t1_deei8q2,You just missed the Definitive Edition being  on Steam unfortunately. I have pretty much an identical PC i instead of  and its a solid fps on high settings.,sleepingdogs,deeje3p,2,t5_2u5qo
