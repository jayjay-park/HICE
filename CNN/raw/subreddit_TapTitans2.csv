Spending for example k for a . increase while your base level hasnt changed in  weeks because you arent strong enough to push high in the next bracket seems kinda silly.

What I initially thought of rewards was ex a guarenteed rare and  eggs each having their own rng for lvls  that made the most sense via the system another thing i found weird andannoying is the weapons. I get normal weapon rng and all but why not seperate unique weaponsthat fill the least spot on the side able to be held because its kinda dumb and weird for new players whom dont have their tab filled to waste such a useful commodity on the random spot they could fill next week.

Up to stage  the ratio grows from  to  so if you dont have the boss gold artifact or the bonus is still bigger from the armor you might as well equip the legendary one.

Id lso lvl pof to  HSh to  same goes with Lp. Should also max ring of fealty because its cheap and up your dmg artis  bit more. Amethyst Staff and Heroes blade will help dmg and  more lvls into FB is pretty decent. That should begood enough will probs take a week or less of time and then after or before if you want you can work on perma shadowcry for farming and speed.  With that you should be pretty solid.,TapTitans2,desvh6f,1,t5_3de1r

11363018,0,t1_dfjxcyi, uhuotuichangI dont see how OPs post changes anything here. OP himself said that its one guy.Even if he has two phones he wouldnt be able to get a good number of hits on each one. Doing it legit on two phones as well as  PCs is out of question. So in order to do CQ with  accounts all at once you have to use bots. Theres literally no way you can do that without using a bot and youre gaining a huge advantage from this single guy.In my opinon as the GM of the  clan you need to be able to spot these people and remove them for a healthy clan. Of course it helps your clan immensly but its unfair to everyone else who tries to keep it clean.,TapTitans2,dfjz5z1,6,t5_3de1r
11363217,1,t3_625ee5,As a manager in China No I personally think they can achieve top  is due to their incredible work and hope you guys may image how hard they have done to mange  clans while the first is continually listing top . Seriously will you guys pay for that amount of diomand even if bot can do  CQweek. The reason why they can reach such high CQ is they attack boss among their  clans.
