2752170,0,t1_cnggexi,I have UP Fit and Wellness running concurrently. I prefer UP but I cant seem to disable the others. After nearly two days on a single charge each of them individually use no more than  of the overall battery. I wouldnt worry about drain at all. Ive been at CES all day playing heavily with my watch demoing an app we made and logging steps and Im at  right now. Very impressive IMO.,zenwatch,cngws85,2,t5_34ktv

5339433,0,t1_cvtqmn5,If I may ask where did you purchase from? I kind of want to wait as I want to try the watch on to decide on which watch face to get. Though mm is not that big of a difference I am sure. ,zenwatch,cvu66ka,1,t5_34ktv

10316907,0,t1_dcddtkz,This is my first Smart Watch so I cant compare it to the others.  But it does feel very sturdy and well built to start with.  The ability to put standard watch bands on it as well was a big plus for me.  I replaced the leather strap with a Steel mesh one from Amazon. .  It goes quite well with the gunmetal color on the ZW.  The watch has speaker support which allows you to use it sort of like a speaker phone to talk to someone if you should desire.   I have streamed music to it used it for phone calls and a few more things with Autowear and Tasker. Overall the watch is very good it does have shortcomings though  on a sunny day outdoors you will have trouble reading the display this can be somewhat solved by turning the brightness to max but be ready for that.  It is not round which does limit somewhat the selection of watch faces.  However you can use almost any watch face out there including round ones and it will display it without problems. Overall I have been quite happy with the watch I have excellent battery life and am not afraid to submerse it in water when I am washing my hands or the occasional reaching into sink of clean water to pull a plug.  It has limited water resistance.  I have not pushed it so far as to wear it in the shower or have it wet for more than a few seconds at a time.   ,zenwatch,dcdh71z,1,t5_34ktv
10377176,0,t1_dck8ub1,I put my ZW watch on at am by pm Im at . This is after  telephone calls on my watch many many emails texts I use the phone for work. I do not use ambient or tilt to wake.  I like this better than my old  Huawei watch. I can tell you many reasons that I see the ZW watch performing better than the Huawei Watch. ,zenwatch,dckbekf,2,t5_34ktv
10668384,0,t3_5slzx7,Currently I dont think so.  However the soon to be released Android Wear  will introduce watch apps that wont require a companion app be installed on your phone. So when that update rolls out and apps become available more watch independence will be likely. But you will probably always need the blue tooth for call notification. ,zenwatch,ddgd2of,2,t5_34ktv
10744749,0,t1_ddo6qor,Yeah but the washer drains part way through so its not always filled with water. Also it was in a soft hoodie pocket unless it fell out.Id be more surprised if it didnt survive.,zenwatch,ddo8mkw,2,t5_34ktv
