On the last day of school he cornered me in the hallway and said Now what are you going to do that I failed you?He didnt know that I had already been to the Deans and Counselors with all my work to prove my innocence.  I knew I was OK since I took Drivers ED during the summer.  My counselor said Fuck him.  Youre fine this isnt even worth trying to fix.So my reply alone in the hallway to him was Nothing.  I took Drivers Ed during the summer.  Do your homework before you try and fuck another student over bitch.   He didnt even say a word.,ChicagoSuburbia,dc31jy8,2,t5_3icdu
