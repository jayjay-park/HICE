559707,0,t3_20jonr,Boy oh boy looks like youve just hit a bad batch.The K coils are very much experimental Ive heard more people having trouble with them. If you wouldve gone to Amazon you couldve gotten one that was pretested by the seller like this one sorry its in German.From what Ive seen more than a third of the Ks are faulty in a way. Theres two things usually wrong with them Reversed QQN adapters. The company that makes the K uses Germanstandard QQN which is exactly opposite of what you may be used to. Germanstandard Ks wound up in the wrong boxes. You might be able to find an inverter on eBay or you could just hook up your K backwards and pray for the best. Make sure you get an inverter that can handle the Ks amount of Genvs. Jammed calibration sensors. If the sensor got stuck during shipping or something it will make your unit appear to be reverseZadvosky calibrated when actually it isnt. This will be fixed in the K but of course youve already bought a K.Hope youll be able to salvage your environ coil  its really quite a beast once you get it going  Good luck!Edit What kind of Pondson tool are you using?

If you ran it through some rack mounted phase inverters then maybe youd get enough output to give off a few hertz of delta rays barely enough for the sine readings to Mark up.

For instance if you want to do something with DM proxies youll want a Grober Codex Unit. But if you want to adjust the Tahg emission you cant have one of those. To work out exactly what you need youll want VXheads.com forum. I heard about an experimental teenager messing up his T Cyclon and screwing up the GUP readings for the whole east coast.

10493850,0,t3_5q7px6,Yes of course.  Most coils contain some chips that allow them to power up quickly and tolerate large amounts of radio wave interference.  I am not sure who you learned from but the problem isnt a feedback loopradio wave interference it is when your attenuators go out of sync as it is really hard to measure the stronger it gets.I could talk for days about this but basically the extrapolator coil is an essential part of any decent VX set.  When you are operating and you shut it off all those radio waves that are running through your system hits the coil and it has nowhere to go and becomes dangerous.  One of the best mods here is a Yoshimi Valve.  I know the wait for one of these is a long time but this valve opens up and creates a relief path.  Without a Yoshimi you can get very high pressure spots and the feedback can go back through your entire system.  What a lot of people dont realize is that most models come with some sort of way of dealing with this but most were so unreliable that they have been disabled.
