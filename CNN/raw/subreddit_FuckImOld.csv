8844886,0,t1_d7ak8e6,News flash neither have your parents or probably given your age your grandparents. Korea was a much worse shit storm than our action in the Middle East the last decade and a half. Weve had boots on the ground there since . Go further back do you think after WWII we just packed up and nobody stayed in Germany?  didnt change anything. Nothing is different for you than it has been for the last three generations of Americans except maybe that you have an unlimited soapbox called the Internet you get to use to whine about it. ,FuckImOld,d7b137f,1,t5_2ynlj

10133997,0,t1_dbsbnql,The cart was relatively new then and kind of a big deal. At my school we were still mostly using film strips and reel to reel projectors. There was only one cart. Full of faux wood and top load vhs. I guess  is the millennial JFK moment Im not surprised they wouldnt want to show a known tragedy to school children. Its quite a different scenario you wouldnt have been watching the towers for some big moment otherwise. ,FuckImOld,dbsgqne,1,t5_2ynlj
