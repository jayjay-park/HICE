4698773,0,t1_ctmt5s9,The thing is Five Guys is not comparable to BK or McD  it just looks like them which for me takes away a bit of the pleasure. For the same value you get a better experience elsewhere. But the quality is leagues better than the former and the patties at FG are actually thin  so Im sure youd like it a lot.Now I can recommend a bunch of other good burger places where you indeed pay London prices but you get really good burgers and most likely not as easy to make at home. There are a lot of experimentation with different thickness of meat or kinds of buns and lots of varied ingredients and sauces including putting thyme on the chips.I had a burger today that had beef bacon BBQ sauce chillies marinated onion and potato sticks inside it and the bun tasted home made.,NoMansSkyCircleJerk,ctmtid4,1,t5_36w1s

Dont worry though everyone else will be able to visit the same game on their release date.EDIT grammar,NoMansSkyCircleJerk,ctzvb7d,1,t5_36w1s
