5623389,0,t3_3s4jma,To me the most fascinating part of Ben Carsons candidacy isnt just how many false claims hes been making.  Its how many easily debunked false claims hes been making.For instance if a Republican says that global warming isnt caused by humans or that black people are hurt by affirmative action both those statements are false but theres just enough inconsistency in the evidence where they can muddy the waters and create just a smidgen of doubt.  But Carson is putting stuff on the record that can be debunked with  certainty by anyone with five minutes and an internet connection.It really shows an amazing level of contempt for his electorate.  Hes basically assuming that  nobody knows anything about what hes speaking about and  nobody will bother to question anything.  Its a strategy that probably works pretty well for selling Christian inspirational books but will probably catch up to him in a contested election.,gogopgo,cwu4vb8,2,t5_31o77
