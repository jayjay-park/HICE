336165,0,t1_cffk5mq,Im pretty sure I have a oz of the Abyss in a box somewhere in my basement Ill have to double check but again if I have it its a bomber if you want it. I also always have some Deschutes Obsidian stout and Inversion IPA on hand in s and I can get a lot of what they offer. I know I have some Elysian Loser which is one of my favorite pale ales and some SplitShot which is a good coffeemilk stout and I know I have some more Elysian styles in my basement but Im being secretive about rooting around boxes today so they might be bombers as well. I promised my girl I wouldnt even be on reddit but this is too important and shes not home yet... Any styles you are partial to and if so any specific flavors you are into? Ive really been into a couple of the Selkirks recently top notch BelgianAmerican and Hair of the Dog has a lot of great stuff in most styles. On a whole hops are king out here so any hop flavors you like are well represented. Whats good at Flying Fish? I looked it up and Brooklyns Black Ops was the stout Ive heard of as well as their saison if you havent seen Blast yet. Any recommendations there?,beercellar,cffm3pq,1,t5_2x176
