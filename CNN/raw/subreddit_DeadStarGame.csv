7349417,0,t1_d2cczi7,I doubledown on this and add that if you are going up against an agile scout ship to not fire wildly. You have the shields and the time so use them. Get a feel for where the idiot is going and fire off a volley as he gets near. Minus a particularly good Razor player I havent had any issues against anything but the Justicar using this ship.,DeadStarGame,d2dku1k,1,t5_3bd6g
7433832,0,t3_4h34dm,Pissed me off the other day. I was just about to take the core and a guy from the blue team was sweeping through our red team so that we couldnt get the award. He got us off guard as we were all working on the core but just as we were about to take it the ct started taking us all out starting with me. To me thats a pure ct thing to do.,DeadStarGame,d2n6gwz,1,t5_3bd6g

7588114,0,t1_d34l2zy,I got the contract late last week and used it a few days ago. It was on jump  or  I believe but honestly Im just guessing. I just remember that I definitely got it as one of my jump rewards. Thank you for taking the time to pursue this issue with me. Many devs would just have ignored me I feel. ,DeadStarGame,d34qcdi,1,t5_3bd6g
