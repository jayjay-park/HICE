2807341,0,t1_cnn5ati,Nice man! Yeah the reason I decided to grow out my undercut is simply because Im sick of it and it seems like EVERYONE has undercuts these days. Like I said in my post it seems like the solution to every guy who wants a new haircut is short on the sides long on the top. I did like my undercut but it after having it for a year I quickly got sick of it. And yeah I agree my long hair on top does cover my sides...and I have enough length up top to put it in a top knot so I do that a lot too.

3531169,0,t3_30q1fq,hey ill try my best to answer yr questions. for starters growing out yr hair is frustrating. we all go through several awkward phases between short medium and truly long. my only advice is to just power through it wear hats when it long enough keep it tied back. as for an unruly mess you do have some power over this. while it can lengthen the time it takes to reach whatever yr overall length goal is id recommend still getting regular haircuts. ive been growing it out for about  years now but i still go in for a trim every  months or so. this will help you clean up raggity ends get yr neckline shipshape and just give you a professional opinion on yr lookdesired outcome. it will also make yr long hair look more stylish and less like you just crawled off the set of cast away. as far as i can tell yr hair will be pretty curly at length so you need to look up pics of guys with a similar grain. if you dont like what you see i wouldnt bother growing it out. take some time to find a person who seems to have very similar hair to you now and dig around for any pictures of them with long hair. also keep in mind the curlier it gets the more time it takes to look longer.as for necksideburns get them mercilessly trimmed. i wear my hair up most of the time and so its important to make both look clean. the trend right now with long hair is to keep it in a man bun and close trimmed beard. if you dont want the beard id shave the burns completely.product is a tricky subject everyone has their own preference. i use tigi shampooconditioner and while its still damp just a dimesize amount of argan oil i use John Masters to keep it shiny and smooth. i dont do anything more than that or it just looks too styled. all in all theres really no way to tell exactly what it will look like just take the plunge. if you hate it as before you can always go back. ,FierceFlow,cpurzwx,7,t5_30hqx

Most of the awkward phase pictures on this sub seem to be related to the fact that the hair isnt quite able to be tied up yet but is too long for any styles that can typically be used for shorter hair. However I think many of these awkward phase pictures actually have some great length!Id love to see some pictures after relatively short hair but before what many call the awkward phase without any trims.

5631325,0,t3_3s6rmh,I have noticed that as my hair got past the shaggy stage the negative comments essentially stopped. My dad would always ask me when I was getting a haircut because he is a very traditional short haired kind of guy but once he realized I was growing it out for a while he stopped questioning it entirely. Since it has started to get longer  inches basically all comments have come in the form of compliments. Apparently my long curls fit my personality better and help with my permanent bitch face. I still cant even put my hair in a bun without Bobby pins but I can say that my hair has become a significant part of me. As annoying as it can be I do recognize its significance. Whether or not I cut it after I achieve my desired length I can say that every day that I dont cut it has made me appreciate it more and more. The only thing that I dont like about my hair is the fact that I think about it a lot. But I do find that the thoughts have become less about worrying and more about optimism. Never thought something so simple would have quite the impact on my psyche but it has in a weird way.,FierceFlow,cwv4aph,2,t5_30hqx

When I had short hair I literally did almost nothing shampoo it once or twice a week pretty much only comb it with my hands and if I woke up with horrible bed head Id just splash it with water dry off real quick and I was good to go. With long hair you have to keep it clean brush and comb it consistently styling it isnt hard most the time but you do have to put an effort into it dont expect to fall asleep with wet hair and wake up looking good. I think the main reason some guys dont grow long hair is they just dont want to put up with it. However long hair looks awesome sure like a lot of things it works better for some more than others but every guy should try to have long hair at least once in their life.

6501089,0,t3_44558x,Super late but my husband and I have had great luck with this shampoo from LUSH Cosmetics. Its called Jason and the Argan Oil and comes in bar form instead of in a bottle. It doesnt strip your hair of all its natural oils or cause any build up. Its all great for the environment.To use it you wet your hair wet the bar lather up like youre washing your hands and then rub it into your hair. If you have very long hair you may need to lather up your hand twice scrubbing the top half of your hair with the first lather and the middle and ends with the second.For conditioner we use American Cream which leaves our hair feeling soft to the touch but not weighed down by heavy oils.If your hair is exceptionally dry and brittle you may need to do a leave in conditioner. You can also use coconut oil like a leave in conditioner.,FierceFlow,czrrfgp,1,t5_30hqx

6562871,0,t3_45hurp,I thought this was an interesting question and did a little research.  Lots of different answers but apparently  years ago or so it was not a big deal to be a man with long hair.  It appears that WWI changed that as there were problems with lice and fleasPrior to the war both men and women commonly kept long hair at least in western societies and the Far East. This became problematic during the Great War where armies encountered severe hygiene issues fighting in the trenches. Under the unsanitary conditions of the front soldiers adopted short hair to mitigate the scourge of lice or fleas.The men who fought in that war were numerous  million and the  million survivors lived a further half century and had an overwhelming influence on those younger ... Men for the next half century had to measure themselves against the war veterans to try to give themselves and others the impression that they too could have endured the trenches. That became the measure of manhood. And so the style of the veteran of the trenches  short hair suntan dangling cigarette the taciturn unfeeling nonchalant post which does not flinch when someone a few yards away gets shot  becomes the male style of the twentieth century.

I find that patting my mostly straight hair dry and then letting it air dry after taking a shower prevents it from becoming unruly later on. Oh and you might want to wash your hair with lukewarm to warm water not too hot. That makes your hair less likely to frizz.

8826453,0,t3_51287x,I think the best styling product for your hair is produced by your own scalp. I noticed that after i have started to do scritching and preening my hair has become a lot more manageable.I start by massaging my scalp all over with my fingers. This is actually very healthy for your scalp some say that it stimulates hair growth and it loosens up the sebum and dead skin particles. After doing this i attempt to spread the sebum from my roots to all over in my hair. I prefer to do this with my fingers but a natural bristle brush or a wooden brushcomb can be very effective depending on your hair type. wooden or boar bristle brush because those are porous and that is very useful when you try to spread that natural scalp oil around.After your hair has a nice coating of sebum it becomes so much more manageable and very healthy. This is why i have stopped using shampoo. I noticed that after shampooing my hair it becomes very dry and kind of lifeless and basically without any texture and it becomes very difficult to shape.Many conditioners also have surfactants which dissolve and remove that sebum so using too much conditioner too often can be a bad thing as well.Another thing that i noticed is very good is that you can use a hat or a headband or pins to train your hair to go in a certain direction or to achieve a certain part in your hair. A very effective time to do this is when you are sleeping. and also just just constantly using your hands to make your hair go where you want it to go. Eventually it will stick you just need to be patient hahaI slept with a headband pulling my hair in a certain direction and i finally achieved getting my hair to keep out of my face without using shitloads of pomade and other styling products.,FierceFlow,d78tfsy,1,t5_30hqx

10734204,0,t3_5tjrkz,Holy shit am I envious. Its a little more than wavy but not quite what Id consider curly. And that color while I know you used a filter Mayfair perhaps wink is heavenly. I also think its amazing that you look like a young Pauly Shore. PS Sorry if I come off as a dick actually trying to legitimately help but next time turn your phone around so the back camera is facing you and the screen is facing the mirror. Youll get a lovely shot without the camera in it and you can use the mirror to see the screen to center up the shot and because you have a iPhone you can just use volume up or down to take a picture.,FierceFlow,ddn5i7p,3,t5_30hqx

11350705,0,t3_607wql,a lot of first timers believe they need to keep the back long like you do. the truth is u dont if u trim the bottom by  inches it will make a massive difference in mitgating the awkwardness. i highly rec u chop that part off or else it will always look like an awkward lobe of hair even when u have a true flow,FierceFlow,dfiky19,1,t5_30hqx
