44340,0,t3_1ujxfo,Hey bud Im just a lowly premed here based in Texas but Ive been shadowing a cardiothoracic pediatric surgeon for a few years. The doctor whom I work with is John Mark Morales and hes done hundreds if not thousands of complex procedures on patients that have congenital cardiovascular defects from ligations of a patent ductus arteriosus to correction of a pentalogy of cantrell.

1955318,0,t1_ckok7fi,In short blockages can be missed.  If you take a look at the attached picture.  Both A and B show blood vessels with significant lesions however on coronary angiography RAO projection and LAO projection the lesions appear minimal.This is about a short as I can make.  Realize that a proper answer requires a basic understanding of xray physics planar vs cross sectional imaging and the principle of orthogonal views.  In addition Im completely ignoring the fundamental difference between stable coronary artery disease and acute plaque rupture which even many training physicians dont understand.  Also the quality of an angiogram is very operator dependent and there is no way for anyone on this forum to assess the technical quality of the prior angiogramAlso please dont take offense but I cannot take your interpretation of what they did at face value.  Youll need to provide a copy of the report or even the films themselves.  Even then were just interpreting that data in isolation.,Cardiology,ckotht1,3,t5_2ujix

2148833,0,t3_2jkyuz,Optical coherence tomography exists for the cardiovascular system allowing for intraarterial optical imaging using near infrared light.It produces some very cool imagesLightlab makes one I think now owned by St. JudesThe interesting thing is is how they went about the problem of blood cells getting in the way. Well ... they got rid of them. You actually use radiocontrast dye which is transparent to flush the artery temporarily while the camera tipped catheter is rapidly pulled to obtain images.Costs ... I am completely unsure.Read up on the OCT technology though as I suspect thats basically what youll be reinventing.,Cardiology,clcyrus,2,t5_2ujix

To go back to my former Healthy Warrior self not forward with a failing heart that needs assistance. I will discuss all options with my Dr. AND i have a lot of feelings  that i am trying to sort out about all of this.  I appreciate your candor and good info.   ,Cardiology,cwc4chn,1,t5_2ujix
6176962,0,t3_3zn826,While I agree that point of care ultrasound is a very powerful tool I think it needs to be used in the right hands. Currently I feel that POC US is used by many untrained physicians who lack insight into echo interpretation leading to many unnecessary consults. I worry that expanding this would create more confusion at least in the short term. ,Cardiology,cyrr8p0,1,t5_2ujix
