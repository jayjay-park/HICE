1953994,0,t3_2gznwt,FYI if you want to rent a tow dolly in the future UHaul has a list of what kind of vehicle is needed to tow other vehicles. If your tow rig isnt on the list they wont rent you a dolly. Smaller privately owned rental places wont do this the responsibility is yours.Case in point I wanted to tow a  ton Chevy truck that had no motor or transmission in it making it about  pounds lighter than their list said it was. I had a  ton diesel dually GMC that was MORE than capable of that load. They wouldnt rent to me. I went elsewhere rented a dolly and towed it without problems.,GreenBay,ckonqx1,1,t5_2ri8u

2817877,0,t1_cnochhl,One more thing I forgot Ive had good luck with every time Ive used Tundra Valley Taxi. Cab arrived in a decent amount of time when called fare was usually  and my house is probably roughly the same distance from downtown as aloft. Also I cant believe I forgot Als Hamburgers. Total greasy spoon hole in the wall. Charming old place even if freshly rebuilt after a fire with fantastic burgers and great breakfast. Closes early so dont expect to get dinner. ,GreenBay,cnodw96,0,t5_2ri8u

3614054,0,t1_cq47wq6,Well its a matter of eliminating each bottleneck.For instance if you use  and dont get within  of your advertised speed unhook your router and connect your laptop directly to the cable modem.  This eliminates all other variables your router and your wireless from the equation.Rerun the test.  If it still isnt with in  then reboot the modem and the laptop.  Try again.  If it still doesnt perform within  then contact TW for tech support.  Could be a cable to the pole.If it works fine then try again directly wired to your router.  If that DOESNT work do the whole rebooting again. If its still a nogo then its your router.  If its fine try the same test wireless.  If it fails do the whole reboot yadda yadda.  If it still fails try another laptop.  If that works its the wireless in your laptop. If its the same and still a fail then its the wireless in your router.As a general rule you want a router with Broadcom or Atheros wireless chipsets.  Apple and high end Linksys and Asus use these chipsets.  If you are spending less than . for a wireless routerfirewall....you arent spending enough if network performance is a requirement.If you are not using VoIP services I think that mb down should be plenty again provided you are not trying to stream k. not like there is much k content anyway.,GreenBay,cq4884d,2,t5_2ri8u
