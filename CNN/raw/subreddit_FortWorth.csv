The nd opener for Stick Men was a band called Dove Hunter that seemed to have a roots rock feel but with some prog elements  wouldnt mind seeing them again.  I used to really enjoy a band called Miss Molly amp the Whips back in Houston in the s I moved here in  and would love to see a similar band  Texas blues with a female lead vocalist that has some attitude.,FortWorth,cetjunl,1,t5_2rsbl

222837,0,t1_cf3tkap,I have NOT ONCE had a good experience with Salsa Limon not when it was just the food truck and not at the stand alone restaurant. At the food truck they were constantly getting orders wrong and because of that taking forever. I once waited over an hour for  tacos and since my coworker was expecting them specifically I couldnt ask for a refund and just leave. Others did. When my order was finally ready they had gotten mine wrong but I just cut my losses and left anyways.At the restaurant my grievancesThe pork belly. What the heck? Pork Belly is one of my favorite things in the universe but they make it nasty. They overcook it until its got the texture of shards of glass and I dont even know what season they choose but it tastes like plastic packaging that got burnt. Its just bad.The staff is always rude and will sometimes purposefully get my order wrong. I can only have very mild sauce for dietary health reasons but every time I order the mild sauce they will sit there and argue with me that the other sauces taste better. One time they gave me the spicy sauce and WOULD NOT LISTEN they just kept saying youll like this better. No I wont. And you wont either if you got my hospital bill for if I were to eat it.Ive had the cabbage be stale and wilted. Ive watched the cook wipe his nose and then use his bare hand to toss meat onto the flat iron with the same hand.Im never eating there again and I only went as many times as I did because its a reoccurring choice in my office that I get dragged along to.

The fracking video got me too. It my first time there since they redid it. We had done most of the kids stuff and decided to go there. Started out with origins of earth and some decent science. I started to get excited then the fracking hero worship started and all I could hear was Tommy Lee Jones telling me to get behind the Barnett in the back of my head over and over. The planetarium is still nice but that is about it. I really want to try out the perot on Dallas.

If the car has something wrong with it they take photos of it and slap a sticker on it giving you notice to fix your car within X amount of days or they will tow it.

3978872,0,t3_3601v0,Im also in the NRH and have a couple recommendations.First off if you dont want to drive you can hit up Moms Spice in Hurst.  This place is in a gas station which is a thing here.  They are known for their Biriyani Indian fried rice and does a brisk take out business. The curries they have there are greasy not a bad thing for me and are very tasty.  They also have a daily lunch buffet you can try and the fried fish there is very good.  Its a little divey if you decide to try the buffet its got maybe  seats and old furniture plus it can be slow so the food can get old they are primarily a take out place but it is the only place I know of that has goat curry on the buffet.  Id give it a CBMy next pick would be Our Place in Irving.  Unlike  of the Indian buffets I have been to the focus here is Southern Indian foods so its a bit more varied than a typical Indian place.  The dosas are great think an Indian crepe with a filling but crispy and large and the foods on their buffet range from traditional Southern Indian fare to Asian fusion.  If you are up for the drive  I can recommend their buffet.  BEDITAlso in Irving I can wholeheartedly recommend Masala Wok  This place is great.  Thats pretty much all I have to say about it. The curries are great and the Asian fusion is great try the Paneer rolls.  The surprising thing about this place is that it is a chain which boggles the mind since the foods are just so well done.  If I had one of these next to me I would eat here once a week easy. ALast and my most favorite is Tandoor in Arlington.  Its my personal favorite buffet as the food is always fresh they have a lot of folks in there during the buffet and the cooks can really cook.  They have typical buffet dishes Chicken Tikka Masala Naan Samosas Tandoori Chicken etc. and a few house specialties including vegetarian options.  The owners are great folks and its my familys go to Indian spot. BI hope you find some interesting places to try!,FortWorth,cr9tp4n,7,t5_2rsbl

There is a nice mountain bike trail also called Northshore.  The problem however atm is the rain fall we had this spring.   The mountain bike trail still has sections underwater and the lake is still  feet above normal and a lot of boat ramps are out of service.

7499855,0,t3_4hy2c4,Good luck.I had the same thing from Grand Prairie a few years ago. By the time I got the notice it was after the legal appeal period and their defense was I hadnt updated my address in all the required agencies still the company wouldnt consider even reviewing it. They dumped it on the cops.The cops had one officer in charge who never answered his phone resigned calls or responded to emails. And I was advised that if I didnt resolve it I couldnt renew my license.I finally got action by emailing the mayor and city manager who finally got the cop to look at it and as I expected it was from a day that they were working on railroad tracks and left their cart where it triggered the crossing arms. Everyone had to run the light because it couldnt change and there was no other option.

7548480,0,t1_d303699,I wasnt planning on going but I sure am now. Trans kids are in more danger due to bullying and intolerance than your child. There are stalls in every bathroom. If your child is worried about being seen urinating they can simply use a private stall. As far as sexual encounters in bathrooms the schools already have an issue with thatI taught high school and middle schooland its the heterosexual kids every time. No kid in Texas is going to pretend to be trans to hook up in a bathroom. ,FortWorth,d308525,9,t5_2rsbl

But when you play to the lowest common denominator you have to accept that it affects how your talent and you are viewed. And just because somethings popular doesnt mean its good. So to get beyond that you have to do some great work that isnt what youve become known for and I havent seen that from you.But your standup could be phenomenal.
