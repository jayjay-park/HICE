Its a water garden of statues in Cancun Mexico. Tell me that isnt eerily reminiscent of Cainhurst.  ,BloodborneLore,d1xshem,2,t5_36kso
9604562,0,t3_5cjb2e,Thank for your insight! Id like for everyone to comment Japanese speaker or not.What you point out certainly seems to be in line with Bloodborne dreams nightmares etc that seems to be sustained by specific Great Ones. It always struck me as weird that Patches refers to the Amygdala as godhead,BloodborneLore,d9wyixf,2,t5_36kso
