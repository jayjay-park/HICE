9314111,0,t1_d8w73wx,Sounds great thanks. Im a big drum and bass fan look forward to trying that out! LTJ Bukem is what dragged me away from being exclusively a MetalRock kid back in the s! Bukem didnt work so great I dont think its been a while so I may be wrong though. Same with Roni Size Reprazent too... thinking back though. surely Brown Paper Bag would be great?! Maybe theres too much other stuff going on at the same time as the main riff thats what I find usually breaks it I find.Breakbeat Era are great though short lived drum and bass live band that Roni Size produced they have some nice strong catchy basslines whilst not super fast theyre fun to play!,AudioShield,d8wms1g,1,t5_3e0u3
