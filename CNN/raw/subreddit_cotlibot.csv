11573924,0,t1_dg7njd8,Aye I do get occasional resets with  now. Last time was strange though  the bot was unchecked to reset when not progressing so that I could push t st crusader overnight with reset ever  mins enabled. I guess one of the resets from every  min got through somehow? Even though they dont seem to be working normally.It would be useful to have some mouseover tooltips explaining the functionality of each button e.g. the difference between reset when not progressing and Reset every xx mins,cotlibot,dg7ws5k,1,t5_3iliv
