6777149,0,t3_48jjpy,I think you hit the nail squarely on the head when it comes to pushing folks to APs. I have no hard data to base this on because Disney certainly isnt going to release it... but I have to assume most folks buying single day passes are people who live in Southern California. As such when looking at the price increase it may make more sense to just get a So Cal AP. If they opt for a low tier card theyre automatically blacked out during Christmas and summer. Not only is Disney getting more money by selling the pass theyve now prevented that person from showing up during notoriously busy times.  ,FreshBakedDisney,d0kh25d,7,t5_2ygjz
