Basically  schoolgirls that turn into magical girls via a phone app that a magical tree gives them to fight aliens that seek to destroy itThe lighthearted start and sliceoflife feel that Episodes If you read the Novels has and then its shift into action and dark tones and it gets progressively worse. The Light Novels get pretty dark specially Nogi Wakaba is a Heroin my opinion its similar because of the dark magical girl tone and evilFavlike antagonists Taisha...If you liked it. be sure to check out the manga and LNs its a very interesting read. Its getting a second season next year and a movie,shoujoraisingproject,dbp0j7z,7,t5_3g4d5
10141923,0,t3_5jlwxp,The ability to change ones own massThe magical girl who got this ability was very fat and had severe body image issues. This ability does not change her size or shape just the mass and density.Limitations Minimum mass  of her normal mass and maximum mass  times her normal mass.How it is useful In low mass mode can move very quickly and jump very high. Also lessens force from impact when crashing into something. In high mass mode can attack enemies by falling into them. Also makes impact force higher when attacking enemies with any means.Weakness In low mass mode extremely hard to control movement since just one misstep will cause the whole body to go far in the wrong direction. In high mass mode extremely hard to control movement since a lot of force is required to even move. Additionally attacks in this mode tend to cause damage to herself.,shoujoraisingproject,dbthwdt,2,t5_3g4d5
10630144,0,t3_5rxk8p,Well in my opinion Fav was banking on that very same fact They represent your ideal self explained by Styler Mimis narration during Jokers. When you make a character on a game usually it represents that very same thing. So I guess Fav used that as a sort of loophole. Either that or fairies have some input on the clothes and names but they usually just leave it to randomness out of laziness. Or maybe there is some rule preventing them from allowing a girl to pick. ,shoujoraisingproject,ddcf2rb,1,t5_3g4d5
