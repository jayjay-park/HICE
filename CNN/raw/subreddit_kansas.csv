Law doesnt care if you agree or disagree and neither do I.  It is what it is.  So to follow the law all people have to be treated equally under the law.  That includes children and their education.  You can blame the Protestants for this the Catholics have historically been very much antieducation.  So your rich folks that can afford the best private schools and the poor folks who cant afford anything have to get and equal education.  But thats really hard to quantify even though people try and no one is going to stand in the way of the private school free market so the law offers a baseline education for all students must meet X requirements.  Hence the fucking Department of Education.Now you can be a fascist or a commie or whatever I dont care.  You can fellate the pope and pray he dispenses some indulgence your way.  But the law says people have to be treated equally.  If you want to change the law and say people should be treated unequally thats your right.  But until such time as you achieve that goal best get with the program and figure out how to fund the schools.

When the stores who wont or cant adapt close that will make room for other liquor stores to open who will adapt to a new market. The only part of the legislation I am not in favor of is the provision having to do with liquor licenses. The last time I looked at it they wanted to severely cap the number of liquor licenses available as long as every grocery store that wants one gets one or something along those lines. Continuing to enforce a ridiculous set of laws just to protect your outdated business model is an asinine way of thinking. gtThe problem is the liquor store owners who have made their business plans with the current laws will be at a disadvantage because most of them dont have room to add other items to stay competitiveBullshit every liquor store I have ever been in could free up the space in their fridges by not carrying  different lines of Miller Lite or Budweiser in all different case sizes thats plenty of space for a basic mixer section. Clean out reorganize and be more choosy about what liquors you carry and boom shelf space for snacks. You will be competitive once this happens.

6913596,0,t3_4adqmq,Im on her side here if true. Apparently she let the school know she was raped after the person she accused of rape allegedly sexually assaulted a teammate of hers about a year later. Her accusation and lawsuit are because she feels the school did not handle the situation properly which is at least a lawsuit worth giving. Her timeline looks murkey and I dont know if she will win or not but the lawsuit itself seems reasonable. She believes the school underreports rapes and sexual assaults and if this is true the school is misrepresenting how safe it is. She wants this resolved which is reasonable. ,kansas,d0zz7t6,1,t5_2r8ew

Well yeah I do know.  You mean Christianity is what you think it is and groups that you dont think are Christian arent.  If only the whole world would adopt TheSherbs definition then we would be okay except he really cant define it you just have to know what was meant.Lets throw Hinduism into TheSherbs   Hinduism believes Jesus Was a Holy Man  Jesus Was A Wise Teacher  Jesus is a God.

7622878,0,t1_d38do44,gthe is a idiot for carrying where he was not allowedThe basic argument for constitutional carry is that guns which are safe enough to carry everywhere by untrained people are so critical to protecting yourself and others during crimes that they need to be allowed in schools churches businesses college campuses  basically everywhere.  This is the argument made when suggesting teachers should be armed in class students on campus and everyone in work places. Im not sarcastically making this up  this is the actual argument made every time.So it seems like youre not towing the party line. This guy was just doing his civic duty protecting the graduation ceremony and he had an accident which lets conceded is going to happen to some people some of the time. Your suggestion that this only happens to idiots is like saying only idiot drivers get into car accidents. But what the data tells us about car accidents is  the total number of accidents goes up as you add cars to the road and  accidents go up when you add untrained drivers to the road. Since politicians and the gun industry are giving us more and more untrained people carrying guns everywhere maybe you should get your shit together before telling us that this isnt a big deal because it happens so infrequently.,kansas,d38oiq0,1,t5_2r8ew

If you cut taxes and increase spending you are effectively doing a Keynesian stimulus. The catch is it runs up the deficit. Look what happened under Reagan We did fiscal stimulus during the great recession but Congress pulled back due to the massive deficit run up to near WWII levels.

It could be youre somehow liable for a lot more than just this traffic ticket.I think before dealing with the ticket you should first figure out your strategy to legally separate yourself from the car. Talk to the police maybe also post this in rlegaladvice and see what they say?And if you have the car buyers information Id wait and see what these other guys say but it could be worth giving them a call eventually to try and get a copy of the bill of sale if they still have it. ,kansas,daawnk8,3,t5_2r8ew

The cops might open a case and keep a bit better eye on the house but they cant do anything without an investigation and subsequent proof and going through the courts to get into the house with a warrant. If the cats are creating an unsafe environment  like urine and feces overwhelming the living area  you might call for a welfare check.  But those kinds of situations the cops knock on  the door ask if everything is OK and then go about their day unless something is really wrong and visibly wrong from the entryway.
